            A prominent Palestinian activist who had worked on an Oscar-winning documentary died on Monday after being shot by a Jewish settler in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, according to local journalists and officials.
    


            Odeh Hathalin, who was a consultant on “No Other Land,” a film that documents Israeli settler and military attacks on the West Bank community of Masafer Yatta, was shot in the village of Umm al-Khair, in that same community.
    


            Israeli police said its forces arrived at the scene and detained an Israeli civilian, who was later arrested for questioning. Police did not identify the man they arrested.  The Israeli military claimed that “terrorists hurled rocks toward Israeli civilians near Carmel,” an Israeli settlement near Umm al-Khair.
    


            Hathalin's shooting was first reported by Yuval Abraham, the Israeli investigative journalist who co-directed “No Other Land.” Abraham said Hathalin was “shot in the upper body” and was in critical condition. Later, the Palestinian health ministry said he had died of his injuries.
    


            Many settlers are armed, and violence in the West Bank has surged since the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023. At least 964 Palestinians have been killed since then by Israeli forces and settlers in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, according to the United Nations.
    


            Settlers have a strong influence on Israeli politics, and in the rare cases where they are arrested for violent attacks against Palestinians, they are often released without charge.
    


            Jewish settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank are illegal under international law.
    


‘Why are you not preventing settler terrorism': Palestinians call out IDF following beating death of American man



Ofer Cassif, a left-wing member of Israel's parliament, has demanded that authorities launch an investigation into Hathalin's death.
    


            “The incident occurred in broad daylight, in front of cameras, with no fear of legal consequences – testament to the paralysis of law enforcement and the complete sense of immunity enjoyed by violent settlers,” Cassif wrote in a letter to Israel's Attorney General.
    


            Basel Adra, a Palestinian journalist and a co-director of “No Other Land,” shared testimony to his “dear friend” Hathalin.
    


            “He was standing in front of the community settler in his village when a settler fired a bullet that pierced his chest and took his life. This is how Israel erases us – one life at a time,” Adra wrote in a post on Instagram.
    


            Last month, Hathalin was detained at San Francisco International Airport upon arrival and deported after immigration officials revoked his visa, local media reported. He had been invited to visit a California synagogue as part of an interfaith speaking tour.
    


            CNN reported in March that settlers had also targeted Hamdan Ballal, another co-director of “No Other Land,” outside his home in the village of Susya, also in Masser Yatta. Ballal, who had recently returned from Los Angeles to accept an Oscar for the film, told CNN he thought the group of settlers would kill him. He was detained by Israeli soldiers, handcuffed, blindfolded and beaten.
    


            The film “No Other Land,” which tracked the destruction of the Masser Yatta community between 2019 and 2023, won Best Documentary Feature Film at the 2024 Oscars. Its final scene shows Adra's cousin, Zakara al-Adra, being shot by an Israeli settler in October 2023.

Live Updates


            • Starmer's tougher line: British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said today the UK will recognize a Palestinian state in September unless Israel takes “substantive steps to end the appalling situation in Gaza” and to reach a ceasefire.
    


“Famine thresholds reached”: The “worst-case scenario” of famine is unfolding in Gaza, according to an alert issued today by a UN-backed food security body.
    


• Trump promises aid: US President Donald Trump said he is “working together” with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to get things “straightened out” in the Middle East. This came a day after he said the US will set up “food centers” in Gaza, although he didn't offer details.
    


            • Death toll climbs:  More than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel's war on Hamas began nearly two years ago, Gaza's health ministry said today.
    


• Genocide accusations: A pair of leading Israeli human rights groups accused Israel of “committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.” An Israeli government spokesperson dismissed the report, saying, “We have free speech in this country but we strongly reject this claim.”
    


            Israel said Tuesday it rejects British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's announcement that the United Kingdom would recognize a Palestinian state unless Israel meets certain conditions.
    


            The Israeli Foreign Ministry said the plan constitutes “a reward” for Hamas and harms efforts to implement a ceasefire in Gaza and release the remaining Israeli hostages.
    


Some context: Starmer said today the UK will recognize a Palestinian state in September unless Israel takes “substantive steps to end the appalling situation in Gaza” and to reach a ceasefire.
    


            Starmer has been facing mounting pressure from within his Labour Party to take a tougher line on Israel, made more acute after French President Emmanuel Macron's recent announcement that France would recognize a Palestinian state in September, becoming the first G7 country to do so.
    


            British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said aid from the UK was air-dropped into Gaza on Tuesday.
    


            The UK aid airdrop comes a day after Germany and France said they would send humanitarian assistance to Gaza in coordination with France and the UK.
    


            Israel said last week it would allow aid to be air-dropped into Gaza, despite the United Nations warning that would be expensive, inefficient and dangerous.
    


            Moments after the roar of Israeli jet engines signaled a new missile strike was imminent, huge plumes of dark smoke rose from the impact.
    


            Across several hours Tuesday, a CNN team around the Israeli city of Sderot, which is along Gaza border, heard and saw at least a dozen missile impacts in northern Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces say it continues to target Hamas in the area.
    


            Any aid convoys heading into northern Gaza on Tuesday afternoon would need to navigate the conflict. In the five hours this CNN team spent driving along semi-arid farmland close to Gaza's northern border, no trucks carrying aid were sighted.
    


            What was apparent: Northern Gaza was filled with the sounds of war.
    


            Dust from troop carriers and tanks could be seen rising between the already pulverized village streets of Beit Hanoun, and heavy machine gunfire and small arms fire crackled nearby.
    


            Israel has in recent days repeatedly held consultations on the return of the remaining hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement Tuesday.
    


            Israel “hasn't stopped trying” to work out a ceasefire deal with Hamas since its delegation returned from talks in Qatar last week, Netanyahu said.
    


                    “But there is one major obstacle, and everyone knows it — it's Hamas. They persist in their refusal. President Trump said it, Witkoff said it, we're saying it — everyone who knows the facts, including the mediators, knows it,” he continued, referring to US President Donald Trump and US special envoy Steve Witkoff.
                





            Israel is “not giving up,” Netanyahu said. “We will continue to do everything we can, one way or another. We are committed to bringing them home.”
    


Some context: Last week, the United States and Israel recalled their negotiating teams from Qatar, where discussions had been taking place, with Witkoff saying the latest response from Hamas “clearly shows a lack of desire to reach a ceasefire.”
    


            A source close to the Hamas delegation said Monday that the group is looking to harden its position in any further negotiations after Israel and the US withdrew their teams.
    


            France commended the UK for its plan to recognize Palestinian statehood in September if Israel doesn't meet certain conditions, which comes days after French President Emmanuel Macron announced his country would do so.
    


                    “The United Kingdom joins today in the momentum created by France for the recognition of the State of Palestine,” French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot posted on X. “Together, through this pivotal decision and our combined efforts, we break the endless cycle of violence and reopen the prospect of peace in the region.”
                





            British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said earlier Tuesday that the UK would recognize a Palestinian state in September unless Israel takes “substantive steps to end the appalling situation in Gaza” and to reach a ceasefire.
    


UK's foreign secretary: British Foreign Secretary David Lammy reiterated the prime minister's statements on Tuesday, saying the United Kingdom will recognize a Palestinian state if Israel doesn't end its military campaign in Gaza.
    


            Speaking at the United Nations, Lammy called on Israel to end the “appalling situation” in Gaza and to commit to a sustainable peace based on a two-state solution.
    


            He warned that the two-state solution is in peril and vowed that the UK would commit to protecting its viability. “There is no contradiction between support for Israel's security and support for Palestinian statehood,” he said.
    


France's move: Macron announced last week that France will recognize a Palestinian state in September, making the country the first Western member of the United Nations Security Council and first G7 nation to do so.
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the decision would “reward terror,” and his defense minister described it as a “disgrace, a surrender to terror.”
    


            British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the UK will recognize a Palestinian state in September unless Israel takes “substantive steps to end the appalling situation in Gaza” and to reach a ceasefire.
    


                    “I have always said that we will recognize a Palestinian state as a contribution to a proper peace process at the moment of maximum impact for the two-state solution,” Starmer said in news briefing after a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.
                





            “I can confirm the UK will recognize the State of Palestine by the United Nations General Assembly in September, unless the Israeli government takes substantive steps to end the appalling situation in Gaza, agree to a ceasefire and commit to a long-term sustainable peace reviving the prospect of a two-state solution.”
    


            Starmer convened the meeting one day after the UK leader said the British public was “revolted” by images of people starving in Gaza, speaking alongside US President Donald Trump in Scotland.
    


            Starmer has been facing mounting pressure from within his Labour Party to take a tougher line on Israel, made more acute after French President Emmanuel Macron's recent announcement that France would recognize a Palestinian state in September, becoming the first G7 country to do so.
    


            US Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and dozens of other Senate Democrats sent a letter Tuesday to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff demanding the expansion of humanitarian aid in Gaza and continued diplomatic efforts to end the war.
    


            The senators said it is “long past time to bring all of the hostages home,” and added that “the acute humanitarian crisis in Gaza is also unsustainable and worsens by the day.”
    


                    “To prevent the situation from getting even worse, we urge you to advocate for a large-scale expansion of humanitarian assistance and services throughout the Gaza Strip, including through the use of experienced multilateral bodies and NGOs that can get life-saving aid directly to those in need and prevent diversion,” they added.
                





            The 40 senators who signed the letter also made clear that they oppose any efforts to remove Palestinians from their homes.
    


            “This would be antithetical to international humanitarian law, to a sustainable end to this war that prioritizes the long-term safety and security of Israelis and Palestinians alike, to achieving a lasting peace in the Middle East, and expanding the Abraham Accords,” they wrote.
    


            If you're just joining our coverage, here are the latest developments we're reporting today in Gaza:
    


            Meanwhile, France will begin air-dropping aid into Gaza in the “coming days,” the French foreign ministry has said.
    


            The French airdrops will be conducted “to meet the most essential and urgent needs of the Gazan civilian population, which is facing a humanitarian crisis of unprecedented proportions,” the foreign ministry said, adding that it will take “the utmost precautions” to ensure the safety of Gazans when the operations take place.
    


            France is also working to deliver aid via land, the foreign ministry said, though this would require Israel to open more border crossings, something it has rejected in the past.
    


            Aid deliveries on land are “by far the most effective solution for enabling the massive and unhindered delivery of humanitarian supplies that the population desperately needs,” the French foreign ministry said.
    


            It called on Israel “to open all crossing points and for immediate, massive and unhindered access for humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip by land.”
    


            Last year, France, working with Jordan, airdropped food and hygiene kits into the Gaza Strip. In a statement at the time, the French foreign ministry said that this airdrop “reflected France's total commitment to helping Gaza's civilian population.”
    


We reported earlier on how Spain and Germany announced yesterday they would be arranging airdrops into the enclave with the help of Jordan.
    


            Fifty-two aid packages have been airdropped into Gaza today in coordination with Arab nations, the Israeli military said.
    


            The packages, containing food, were air dropped into the southern and northern Gaza Strip, the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement. Israel, Jordan, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates coordinated the drop, it added.
    


            On Saturday, the IDF began dropping aid into Gaza as international condemnation of the starvation crisis in the enclave grew.
    


            US President Donald Trump has been speaking today about Gaza.
    


            He told reporters in Scotland that said he is “working together” with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to get things “straightened out” in the Middle East.
    


            The comment came shortly after he inaugurated a new golf course at one of his resorts.
    


            When asked by a reporter on the sidelines of the event what he plans to say to Netanyahu, Trump smiled and replied, “We're working together to try and get things straightened out.”
    


            “It will get straightened out,” the president responded earlier in response to a question about a possible ceasefire in the region.
    


            This comes just a day after the president held a bilateral meeting with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, during which the two leaders discussed efforts to promote peace in the Middle East.
    


            An increasing number of Palestinians in Gaza are starving to death as tons of food, clean water and medical supplies sit just outside the territory's borders, and aid agencies have warned that Gaza is as close to famine as it's ever been.
    


            For months, the United Nations has said that Palestinians are facing critical levels of acute food insecurity, and on Tuesday the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) initiative said that “the worst-case scenario of famine is unfolding.”
    


            Of 74 malnutrition-related deaths in 2025, 63 occurred in July – including 24 children under 5, a child over 5, and 38 adults, the World Health Organization (WHO) said this week, noting that the situation was “entirely preventable,” while pointing to Israel's blockade on aid.
    


            “I don't know what you would call it other than mass starvation, and it's man-made, and that's very clear,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.
    


            Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has denied that Palestinians in Gaza face starvation.
    


            Since Sunday, 14 people have starved to death in Gaza, according to the Palestinian health ministry.
    


            The following criteria need to be met for a famine to be determined, according to the IPC:
    


            Two of those thresholds have been reached in Gaza already, the IPC said Tuesday, adding that a new analysis is underway. The IPC does not declare a famine but provides an analysis to allow governments and others to do so.
    


            “Many people will have died by the time a famine is declared,” it added.
    


            The IPC has previously classified four places as being in famine: Somalia in 2011, South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, and Sudan in 2024.
    


            More than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel's war on Hamas began nearly two years ago, the health ministry said today.
    


            The ministry reported that 113 people were killed in the past 24 hours, bringing the death toll to 60,034.
    


            The announcement comes as hopes dim for a ceasefire anytime soon, after talks broke up last week without an agreement.
    


            It also comes amid a deepening starvation crisis in Gaza due to Israeli restrictions on aid, and growing international condemnation of Israel's conduct in the war.
    


            The war began after Hamas' October 7, 2023 attack on Israel killed around 1,200 people and saw another roughly 250 people taken hostage.
    


For context: Authorities in Gaza do not distinguish between civilians and Hamas fighters when reporting casualty figures, but the health ministry and the United Nations say the majority of deaths are women and children. And the true toll could be much higher, with many thousands believed to still be under the rubble.
    


            Israel does not dispute that a significant number of Palestinian civilians have been killed in its war in Gaza. But it has long argued that figures from the Hamas-controlled health ministry are exaggerated, and that Hamas embeds itself between civilians, using them as “human shields.”
    


            Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar said on Tuesday that international pressure on Israel “has already caused Hamas to harden its position” in ceasefire talks.
    


            “This pressure is directly sabotaging the chances for a ceasefire and hostage deal,” Sa'ar told reporters.
    


            Last week, the United States and Israel recalled their negotiating teams from Qatar, where discussions had been taking place, with US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff saying the latest response from Hamas “clearly shows a lack of desire to reach a ceasefire.”
    


            A source close to the Hamas delegation said on Monday that the group is looking to harden its position in any further negotiations after Israel and the US withdrew their teams.
    


            International pressure has been piling on Israel to let aid into the besieged Gaza Strip as the hunger crisis escalates.
    


            Sa'ar stressed that international pressure “will not work.”
    


            “Israel will not be the Czechoslovakia of the 21st century. We won't sacrifice our own existence for the sake of the appeasement countries,” he said.
    


            The Netherlands declared two Israeli ministers persona non grata on Monday, according to a letter written by Dutch foreign minister Caspar Veldkamp.
    


            Israel's Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir will not be able to enter the Netherlands because they have repeatedly incited violence against Palestinians, they advocate for the expansion of illegal settlements and they “call for ethnic cleansing in the Gaza Strip,” the letter said.
    


            This comes after Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Norway and the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the two ministers last month.
    


            Smotrich responded with a post on X, writing that the “safety” of Israel is “far more important.”
    


                    “In the Netherlands, and in Europe in general, Jews did not live in safety at the start of the last century. And judging by European hypocrisy, its leaders' surrender to the lies of the radical Islam that is taking over, and the rising antisemitism - Jews will not be able to live there safely in the future either,” he said.
                





            Ben Gvir also responded to the ban. “Even if I'm banned from entering all of Europe, I will continue to act for our country and demand that we dismantle Hamas and support our soldiers,” he said.
    


            “Those who are violent, who murder and rape – they are our enemies. But in Europe… the one who is attacked is the one blamed. In a place where terrorism is tolerated and terrorists are welcomed, a Jewish minister from Israel is unwelcome, terrorists roam free, and Jews are boycotted,” he continued.
    


            Returning now to yesterday's publication of two reports by two Israeli human rights groups who have accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza.
    


            Tirza Leibowitz, Deputy Director and Director of Programs, Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHRI), said her organization felt they “owed it to humanity” to call Israel's war in Gaza a genocide.
    


            Both PHRI and B'Tselem, another leading human rights group, accused Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, becoming the first such organizations inside Israel to make the claim.
    


                    “It is something that we owe to humanity. It is something that we owe in terms of solidarity with the Palestinian people and with our medical colleagues in Gaza as well.”
                


                    Tirza Leibowitz told CNN's John Vause.
                


            PHRI published a legal and medical analysis documenting what it called “deliberate and systematic extermination of the health system in Gaza.”
    


            In a separate major report released Monday, B'Tselem said it came to that “unequivocal conclusion” that Israel was committing a genocide after an “examination of Israel's policy in the Gaza Strip and its horrific outcomes, together with statements by senior Israeli politicians and military commanders about the goals of the attack.”
    


            Israel's foreign ministry rejected the reports by PHRI and B'Tselem, dismissing the accusations as “obscene” and “baseless.” It asserted that Israel only targets Hamas, not civilians, and takes “extensive measures” to avoid harming civilians while delivering aid.
    


            The “worst-case scenario of famine” is currently taking place in the Gaza Strip, according to an alert issued by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a United Nations-backed initiative.
    


            “Conflict and displacement have intensified, and access to food and other essential items and services has plummeted to unprecedented levels,” the IPC said, adding that “mounting evidence shows that widespread starvation, malnutrition, and disease are driving a rise in hunger-related deaths.”
    


            The IPC said that the alert is intended to “draw urgent attention to the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation” but doesn't constitute a formal classification of famine. “Given the most recent information and data made available, a new IPC analysis is to be conducted without delay,” it said.
    


            More than 20,000 children were admitted for treatment for acute malnutrition between April and mid-July, the IPC said, with more than 3,000 severely malnourished.
    


            “Latest data indicates that famine thresholds have been reached for food consumption in most of the Gaza Strip and for acute malnutrition in Gaza City,” the alert said, calling for “immediate action” to end the hostilities and allow for “unimpeded, large-scale, life-saving humanitarian response.”
    


            In May, the IPC reported that the enclave's entire population is experiencing “high levels of acute food security” and the territory is at “high risk” of famine, the most severe type of hunger crisis.
    


            Germany and Spain are sending humanitarian assistance to Gaza, although top officials from both countries acknowledged the aid isn't enough.
    


            German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Defense Minister Boris Pistorius will coordinate with France and the UK, who he said are also prepared to provide airlifts for food and medical supplies. CNN has reached out to the French and UK governments for comment.
    


                    “We know that this can only be a very small help for the people in Gaza, but at least it is a contribution that we are happy to make,” Merz said.
                





            Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares Bueno also said his country would arrange aid airdrops in the next few days in coordination with Jordan.
    


            “Some airdrops with food stuff, but that's just a drop of water in the ocean,” he told CNN's Isa Soares.
    


            Spain plans to air-drop food aid for approximately 5,000 people into Gaza between the first and second week of August. However, the minister emphasized, “This is not what we want. We don't want just a drop here and a drop there.”
    


            Calling for land access and distribution through United Nations agencies, the minister said there needs to be a permanent flow of aid, “unimpeded, without any obstacles.”
    


            Israel will continue working with global aid agencies, as well as the United States and European countries, “to ensure that large amounts of humanitarian aid flows into the Gaza Strip,” the office of Israel's prime minister said yesterday.
    


                    “As part of this effort, Israel paused IDF operations in key populated areas of Gaza from 10am to 8pm every day and designated secure routes from 6am to 11pm that will ensure the safe passage of more convoys delivering aid,” the statement said.
                





            The statement comes after United States President Donald Trump told reporters in Scotland that the US will set up “food centers” in Gaza to address the ongoing starvation and malnutrition crisis amid Israel's aid blockade.
    


            The Israeli prime minister's office said that Israel will “continue to act responsibly, as we always have, and we'll continue to seek the return of our hostages and the defeat of Hamas. That is the only way to secure peace for Israelis and Palestinians alike.”
    


            The statement reiterated accusations against Hamas of stealing humanitarian aid for which it provided no evidence.
    


Some background: An internal US government review found no evidence of widespread theft by Hamas of US-funded humanitarian aid in Gaza. The analysis, conducted by the US Agency for International Development (USAID), looked into 156 incidents of waste, fraud, and abuse reported by partner organizations between October 2023 and May 2025.

            Donald Trump looked like the last king of Scotland.
    


            To the skirl of bagpipes, the president welcomed Keir Starmer to one of his Scottish golfing palaces in his mother's ancestral homeland. The prime minister flew in Monday as a guest and a supplicant in a corner of his own United Kingdom.
    


            Starmer was a mere extra as Trump held court in a mind-bending news conference that rollicked through topics like his hatred of wind power, the window frames in his ballroom and Windsor Castle.
    


            Trump capped his protocol-reversing day by flying the PM across Scotland on Air Force One to another of his exclusive clubs, in another ostentatious show of US power optics.
    


            A day earlier, the top EU official, Ursula von der Leyen, matched Starmer's effusiveness after arriving at Trump's windswept Turnberry links for an audience bearing a trade deal that some Europeans blasted as a surrender.
    


            Events in America's new temporary capital in southwest Scotland were an object lesson in how Trump flexes his indomitable personality and relentless sense of others' weaknesses to impose personal power and rack up big wins for himself.
    


            Six months into his second presidency, Trump is getting exactly what he wants on many fronts. He's destroying the global free trading system by lining up framework trade deals that enshrine one of his longtime obsessions — tariffs. He sent US stealth bombers around the world to bombard Iran's nuclear program. And he's wrung promises of a vast increase in military spending from NATO members.
    


            It's the same at home. Trump has bullied Congress into submission. He's imposing his ideology on great universities. He's forced private law firms to do pro bono work for him and he's weaponizing the justice system against his foes. And he's effectively shut down the southern border and halted undocumented migration.
    


            This is the kind of “winning” that eluded him in his first term and that he promised his MAGA supporters would reach such a volume they'd grow tired of winning.
    


            Yet Trump is such a polarizing president — one whose “wins” are sometimes more theater than substance — that his current streak bears close examination.
    


            Internationally, it is fair to ask: Is Trump racking up victories for the American people or for himself? Is his coercive power over allies and smaller states a sign of strength or the behavior of a schoolyard tough guy? And what will be the consequence of his wins in the long term — years after his zest for a headline proclaiming a great “deal” has passed? The alliances that made the US a superpower seem especially vulnerable in this regard.
    


            If Trump is really a dominant global force, the proof will come in his handling of three critical issues highlighted on his trip to Scotland: a wrenching famine in Gaza, the war in Ukraine and trade.
    


            Trump made surprising tonal shifts Monday on Gaza and Ukraine.
    


            Responding to hideous video of malnourished children in Gaza, Trump contradicted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claim that there's no starvation in the enclave after months of Israeli bombardments.
    


            “We have to get the kids fed,” Trump said, promising to set up food distribution centers to alleviate the growing famine. But he offered few details about how this would work in a war zone where civilians have been killed lining up for food. He also ignored US complicity in the aid crisis following difficulties faced by a Washington-backed Israeli program that bypassed UN experts.
    


            Perhaps Trump's commitment is a genuine shift and could lead to him undercutting Netanyahu, a leader who has repeatedly rebuffed US pressure and damaged the president's wish to be seen as a peacemaker.
    


            It could be, that as happened after chemical weapons attacks in Syria in 2017, Trump was truly moved by heartbreaking footage of suffering children.
    


            But a president with a sharp political sense may have also calculated that growing outrage toward Israel meant he might end up sharing the blame for the horror. The cynic's case is supported by his previous suggestion that Gazans should leave to allow the creation of a “Middle East Riviera” beach resort. And Trump's evisceration of USAID means the dying Gazan kids will be far from alone.
    


            The second test of Trump's global power will come over Ukraine.
    


            The president on Monday vented growing frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin's refusal to accept his generous suggestions for a peace deal in Ukraine, capping his previous 50-day deadline for action to 10 or 12 days.
    


            “We have such nice conversations, such respectful and nice conversations. And then people die the following night,” Trump said.
    


            If Trump really switches from buttering up Putin to punishing him, he could hurt Russia, especially with secondary sanctions that bankroll the war by being Moscow's oil exports. But there's a huge problem: That would require the US to directly take on powers such as India and China, risking global economic blowback.
    


            With Trump in Scotland, his trade negotiators were in Sweden holding high-level talks with China that could yield another “win” for his tariff strategy and potentially the spectacle of a presidential visit to Beijing this year.
    


            Is he really ready to risk all this for Ukraine — a nation that he thinks has already had too much US aid?
    


            A robust move against Putin in the coming days that could also rebound against Xi — even against Trump's own political interests — would show the president is willing not just to lord it over Europeans but to stand up to the most ruthless leaders.
    


            Failing to take such action would validate critics who see Trump's irritation at Putin as less about Ukraine's plight than about the embarrassment about the president's Nobel Prize campaign being thwarted by his erstwhile hero.
    


            On the surface, Trump pulled off a genuine win against the European Union in the trade deal and for his “America First” trade policies, which he views as reversing decades of partners taking advantage of the United States in the interest of reviving American manufacturing.
    


            The EU chose not to use its own economic might to inflict pain on the US economy. Instead, it accepted a deal that will see the imposition of a 15% tariff on European exports.
    


            The backlash was swift.
    


            “An alliance of free peoples, gathered to assert their values and defend their interests, resolves to submission,” French Prime Minister François Bayrou wrote on X.
    


            But others saw pragmatism rather than capitulation, because it's becoming clear that tariffs are existential for Trump — as shown by similar levies included in recent trade deals announced with Japan and the Philippines. Europe's already-sluggish economic growth will take a hit. But a trade war would be worse.
    


            “Those who expect a hurricane are grateful for a storm,” said Wolfgang Große Entrup, the head of the German Chemical Industry Association.
    


            Trump's estimation that the EU agreement was “the biggest deal ever” is hyperbole. The short framework is far from a detailed agreement, which may take years to negotiate and thousands of pages to spell out.
    


            This all looks like Trump's classic habit of spinning a small breakthrough as a gargantuan win.
    


            The framework announcement by the White House is thin and full of conditional language. On closer inspection, it's not clear exactly what the EU has given away. There is no clear indication that the Europeans have ceded to US demands to accept its hormone-treated beef or to ease regulation of Silicon Valley firms.
    


            European leaders are playing a long game.
    


            A trade war with Trump might have destroyed their efforts to prevent him rupturing the transatlantic alliance, which included a pledge for NATO members to raise defense spending to 5% by 2035 during his last transatlantic trip.
    


            It may also not be a coincidence that Trump's change of tack on Ukraine and Gaza — which brought him closer to two critical European foreign policy priorities — came hours after the EU concessions in the trade agreement.
    


            Trump's wins are in the open. Europeans are more subtle.
    


            Starmer is following the same gameplay. His willingness to check his political dignity at the door each time he meets Trump has yielded a friendship with the president — and a tariff rate of 10%, better than that imposed on the EU.
    


            Trump's binary view of a life in pursuit of wins means that he must always come out on top and those on the other side must lose.
    


            Eventually, this is bound to alienate some of America's best friends.
    


            This doesn't matter in the “America First” creed, which seeks to leverage US might against smaller nations whether they are allies or adversaries.
    


            But US alliances and its leadership of like-minded democracy were the key to Washington's power since the end of World War II. And sometimes the country needs its friends — like after the September 11 attacks in 2001. Trump is burning through American soft power at a frightening rate.
    


            And as some of America's traditional allies consider closer ties to China, there are clear signs that Trump's transactional approach could wreak long-term damage.
    


            In the latest issue of Foreign Affairs, former Bush administration foreign policy official Kori Schake writes that the Trump team is hastening a future in which countries “opt out of the existing US-led international order or construct a new one that would be antagonistic to American interests.”
    


            And it's not even clear that many of Trump's wins will bring greater security at home. After all, by punishing Europe with a 15% tariff on its goods, Trump has imposed yet another consumption tax on Americans.
    


            “It's a number that will hurt both the US and EU economies,” Fredrik Persson, president of BusinessEurope, told CNN's Richard Quest.

The US has likely deployed nuclear weapons to Britain for the first time in over 15 years, in a potential warning to Russia, Bloomberg reported on Monday, citing open-source data and defense experts.

On July 16, a US military transport aircraft flew with its transponder active from Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico – an installation known to house nuclear weapons – to RAF Lakenheath in eastern England, the report says. The aircraft is believed to have carried B61-12 thermonuclear bombs, which would mark the first known US nuclear deployment to the UK since 2008, according to several defense analysts.

Former senior NATO arms control official William Alberque said leaving the aircraft's transponder on was intentional and appeared to be aimed at sending a message to Moscow. “This is a down payment that there's more to come on shifting NATO's deterrence posture toward strengthening,” he said. “Returning US nuclear weapons to the UK is no small feat.”

Neither the US nor the UK has confirmed the move. It is also unclear how many weapons the US may have redeployed.

NATO's nuclear posture in Europe has remained largely unchanged since the end of the Cold War, with tactical nuclear weapons currently stationed in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, and Türkiye. Any movement of nuclear assets closer to Russia would likely be regarded as a major escalation.

The Bloomberg report comes after the UK – which has nuclear weapons of its own – confirmed plans in June to acquire at least 12 F-35A fighter jets capable of carrying US B61-12 bombs. London called the move “the biggest strengthening of the UK's nuclear posture in a generation.”

Last year, former NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the bloc was considering deploying more of its nuclear weapons to deter Russia and China – which he described as “potential adversaries.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the remarks “yet another fueling of tensions.”

China has unveiled its first nationwide childcare subsidy program, offering families an annual payment of 3,600 yuan (approximately $500) for every child under the age of three. The measure, announced on Monday, is part of a broader government effort to curb the country's persistently low birthrate and long-term demographic decline.

The policy marks the latest attempt by Beijing to counteract a historic demographic downturn. China's population declined for seven consecutive years before registering a modest rebound in 2024. The slide has been driven by a steep drop in births, a rapidly aging society, and growing economic uncertainty. In response, authorities have rolled out a series of measures in recent years, including tax breaks, parental leave extensions, and childcare support.

The new program will begin this year and is expected to benefit over 20 million families each year, according to the Chinese National Health Commission. The subsidy will be paid annually until a child turns three and will apply to all children regardless of birth order. It will be exempt from income tax and will not count toward household income when determining eligibility for other forms of social assistance.

The step reflects a significant policy shift away from decades of strict family planning. China ended its one-child policy in 2015, first allowing two children per family and later raising the limit to three. However, birthrates have continued to decline. Although there was a modest rebound in 2024, when the country recorded around 9.5 million births, the figure remains nearly half of what it was in 2017. Government data shows a steady drop throughout the early 2020s, with 2020 marking the lowest birth total in more than four decades.

Despite growing state support, many young Chinese remain reluctant to have children. Economists and demographers point to financial strain, high housing and education costs, job insecurity, long working hours, and shifting social values, particularly among women, as major factors behind the continued decline in fertility. Urbanization, rising educational attainment, and the lingering psychological legacy of the one-child policy are also cited as factors contributing to shifting cultural attitudes toward marriage and childbearing.

A gunman armed with a rifle opened fire inside a high-rise office building in Midtown Manhattan on Monday evening, killing at least four people, including a New York City police officer, before fatally shooting himself.

The incident unfolded at around 6:30pm local time inside 345 Park Avenue, a 44-story skyscraper that houses the offices of JP Morgan, KPMG, Deutsche Bank, Blackstone, the NFL, and other major firms. The suspect entered the building carrying what the authorities described as a high-capacity M4 rifle.

The gunman opened fire in the lobby before barricading himself on the 33rd floor, where he was later found dead from an alleged self-inflicted gunshot wound to his chest, according to police.

Footage shared by Fox News and local media shows heavily armed NYPD and Sheriff's Department officers with rifles drawn evacuating employees and searching the building. Lines of people were seen exiting with their hands raised as officers secured each floor. At least one person was seen being carried by police and treated on the ground.

The FBI confirmed that agents from its New York Field Office responded to assist with the investigation. Deputy Director Dan Bongino described the situation as an “active crime scene” on social media. Mayor Eric Adams urged New Yorkers to avoid the area and follow safety instructions, stating that an “active shooter investigation” was underway.

As of late Monday evening, police confirmed that there was no further threat to the public. “At this time, the scene has been contained and the lone shooter is dead,” NYPD said in a post on X.

Police identified the suspect as Shane Tamura of Las Vegas, 27, who allegedly had a “documented mental health history.” The motive for the attack remains under investigation, and the authorities are working to determine whether the building or its tenants were specifically targeted.

BRUSSELS, July 29. /TASS/. Roads and railways in the European Union are unprepared for the rapid movement of troops and military equipment across continental Europe in the event of a conflict with Russia, European Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism Apostolos Tzitzikostas told the Financial Times.

He proposes spending at least 17 billion euros on revamping European transport infrastructure in order to improve military mobility.

According to the official, NATO's tanks weighing up to 70 metric tons would be immobilized by tunnels, fragile bridges and customs protocols. Today, ""it takes weeks and, in some cases, months"" to move military equipment and troops ""from the Western side of Europe to the eastern side,"" the European commissioner noted, adding that some of the existing infrastructure facilities had not been built to allow armies to move across the EU.

""We have old bridges that have to be upgraded. We have narrow bridges that have to be widened. And we have non-existent bridges that have to be built,"" Tzitzikostas pointed out. Brussels is currently developing a strategy that would make it possible to move troops within a few hours, or a few days at most, in case of an attack. The initiative includes the upgrade of 500 infrastructure projects along four major military corridors passing through EU countries.

The projects, identified together with NATO and its military command, have been kept classified for security reasons. Brussels also plans to reduce the bureaucratic obstacles, Tzitzikostas said.The paper points out that in June, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte described Russia as the main threat to the alliance and claimed that Moscow allegedly planned to attack NATO in 2030. However, he failed to explain the reasons behind the allegation.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, July 29. /TASS/. Russia continues to protect its interests in the format of the special operation in Ukraine despite the statements by US President Donald Trump. That said, Moscow emphasizes that it would like to achieve results peacefully, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a briefing.

MOSCOW, July 29. /TASS/. The United States and the United Kingdom decided to nominate Ukraine's former Commander-in-Chief Valery Zaluzhny for president at a secret meeting in the Alps, Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) said in a statement made available to TASS.

According to reports received by the SVR, US and British officials organized a secret meeting at an Alpine resort, which involved Andrey Yermak, head of the Ukrainian president's office, Kirill Budanov, chief of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's Main Directorate of Intelligence, and Valery Zaluzhny, the country's ex-commander-in-chief who now serves as Kiev's ambassador to London.

According to the Russian intelligence agency, ""the agreement reached in the Alps sheds light onto the underlying cause of the recent scandalous attempt of the ‘president' to restrict the powers of the local anti-corruption mechanisms."" ""Clearing the political field for Zaluzhny, Yermak had ‘set up' Zelensky, convincing him that such a step would not spoil Kiev's relations with the Western partners, but actually had created a pretext for the West to start a campaign aimed at removing the ‘expired' president from power for his ‘encroachment upon democracy',"" the statement notes.

""The meeting held and its results give a reason to address the citizens of Ukraine. Well then, elections of a new president of your country have taken place at an alpine resort.

Trade group says levy will reduce access, disrupt supply chains and cut R&D

Wegovy maker Novo Nordisk's shares plunge on sales forecast



The European pharmaceutical industry has condemned the US move to put 15% tariffs on medicines imported from the EU, calling the taxes a “blunt instrument” that would harm patients on both sides of the Atlantic.

They were responding to a White House text of the deal that inferred the 15% baseline rate on imports from the EU would also apply to drugs if the agreement is implemented on the US side on Friday as expected.

“As part of President Trump's strategy to establish balanced trade, the European Union will pay the United States a tariff rate of 15%, including on autos and auto parts, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors,” the text said.

The European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries (EFPIA) said: “Tariffs on medicines are a blunt instrument that will disrupt supply chains, impact on investment in research and development, and ultimately harm patient access to medicines on both sides of the Atlantic.”

The trade organisation represents drug companies across the bloc including Bayer in Germany, Novo Nordisk in Denmark, and US multinationals with operations in Ireland such as Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson.

The US move to impose import duties on pharma is a breach of a 1995 World Trade Organization agreement that medicines and the active ingredients in them are rated at zero tariff.

An EU trade spokesperson said pharma imports from the US to the EU would remain duty free.

Washington's text also indicated that the EU had confirmed it would not introduce a tech tax. An EU spokesperson said this was not the case and the bloc retained the “sovereign right to legislate” in the digital space.

Trump declared war on US pharmaceutical companies that were manufacturing medicines for US patients, and booking profits on those sales abroad.

In March, he repeatedly took aim at Ireland's historical low-tax policies, which helped lure US multinationals including Pfizer, Boston Scientific and Eli Lilly to its shores, claiming the country had looted US businesses.

On Monday, Ireland's prime minister, Micheál Martin, said tariffs in general were not ideal but a trade war would have been “ruinous”.

The EFPIA said it strove to “ensure a fairer distribution of how global pharmaceutical innovation is financed” but there were “more effective ways” to achieve this that would “help rather than hinder global advances in patient care and economic growth”.

The White House text of the deal has added to existing confusion over the position of pharmaceuticals in the trade deal, given that EU officials said on Monday that pharma exports to the US would remain duty free until the US had completed its section 232 investigation into pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.

The text also raises questions over standards of US foods exported to the EU. The EU said the US's reference to commitments to “address non-tariff barriers affecting trade in food and agricultural products including streamlining requirements for sanitary certificates for US pork and dairy products” did not amount to any lowering of its red-line rules on food standards.

It is known that the European Commission has also made a commitment to the UK to streamline veterinary certification processes applying to British food exports post-Brexit. This could include a reduction in the paperwork needed to export products.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Thirty-one high-profile Israelis accuse Tel Aviv of ‘brutal campaign' and demand permanent ceasefire in letter

A group of high-profile Israeli public figures, including academics, artists and public intellectuals, has called for “crippling sanctions” to be imposed by the international community on Israel, amid mounting horror over its starvation of Gaza.

The 31 signatories of a letter to the Guardian include an Academy award recipient, Yuval Abraham; a former Israeli attorney general, Michael Ben-Yair; Avraham Burg, a former speaker of Israel's parliament and former head of the Jewish Agency; and a number of recipients of the prestigious Israel prize, Israel's highest cultural honour.

The figures come from the worlds of journalism, poetry, science, journalism and academia, and the letter accuses Israel of “starving the people of Gaza to death and contemplating the forced removal of millions of Palestinians from the strip”.

It adds: “The international community must impose crippling sanctions on Israel until it ends this brutal campaign and implements a permanent ceasefire.”

The letter is significant both for its unvarnished criticism of Israel and for breaking the taboo of endorsing stringent international sanctions, in a country where politicians have promoted laws targeting those advocating such measures.

Among other signatories are the painter Michal Na'aman; Ra'anan Alexandrowicz, an award-winning documentary filmmaker; Samuel Maoz, the director of the Golden Lion-winning film Lebanon; the poet Aharon Shabtai and the choreographer Inbal Pinto.

The mounting international horror over the trajectory of Israel's war in Gaza is increasingly being reflected inside Israel itself – and within the wider global Jewish diaspora – amid images of emaciated Palestinian children and reports of the shooting by Israeli forces of hungry Palestinians at food distribution centres.

The letter was published as it was announced that more than 60,000 Palestinians had been killed in the 21-month Israel-Gaza war, according to Gaza's health ministry.

On Monday two well-known Israeli human rights groups, B'Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights Israel, released reports assessing for the first time that Israel was conducting a “genocidal” policy against Palestinians in Gaza, breaking another taboo.

On Sunday the Reform movement, the largest Jewish denomination in the US, said the Israeli government was “culpable” in Gaza's spreading famine.

“No one should be unaffected by the pervasive hunger experienced by thousands of Gazans. No one should spend the bulk of their time arguing technical definitions between starvation and pervasive hunger.

“The situation is dire, and it is deadly. Nor should we accept arguments that because Hamas is the primary reason many Gazans are either starving or on the verge of starving, that the Jewish state is not also culpable in this human disaster. The primary moral response must begin with anguished hearts in the face of such a large-scale human tragedy.

“Blocking food, water, medicine, and power – especially for children – is indefensible,” it said. “Let us not allow our grief to harden into indifference, nor our love for Israel to blind us to the cries of the vulnerable. Let us rise to the moral challenge of this moment.”

The latest interventions follow comments earlier this month by the former Israel prime minister Ehud Olmert, who told the Guardian that a “humanitarian city” Israel's defence minister has proposed building on the ruins of Rafah would be a concentration camp, and forcing Palestinians inside would amount to ethnic cleansing.

The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, officials and rightwing NGOs have continued to deny the existence of famine in Gaza caused by Israel.

That has occurred in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, including the UN's exacting and data-based food security monitor, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification mechanism, and Donald Trump's acknowledgment of “real starvation” in the coastal strip.

The Israeli government has been contacted for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

From the first days of Russia's full-scale invasion, Western leftists have invoked “peace” as a slogan — as if peace were not already at the heart of every Ukrainian's daily prayer. They warn the world not to “provoke” the Kremlin, as if Ukraine's restraint could halt Russian missiles. For Ukraine's own leftists, though, the prospect of total annihilation has laid bare how hollow abstract pacifism sounds when survival itself is on the line.

When Russian forces tried to take Kyiv in 2022, Ukrainian writer Artem Chapeye — a well-known leftist and outspoken male feminist — made sure his family reached safety before he enlisted to defend his country. In his latest book ""Ordinary People Don't Carry Machine Guns,"" translated into English by Zenia Tompkins and published by Seven Stories Press, Chapeye reflects on his path to military service, the ways in which the war has upended parts of Ukrainian society, and what it means to hold onto your humanity when forced to pick up a weapon.

“It's easy to hide behind the abstract idea that ‘the more weapons there are, the more war there'll be' when you yourself are safe,” Chapeye writes.

“But what if one of your brothers is sitting with his wife in a corridor in February 2022 on the outskirts of Kyiv, with gunfire all around and Russian armored vehicles already driving by the building, and he is panicking when he realizes that he doesn't even have an axe in his apartment, nothing to defend himself with other than kitchen knives and a meat tenderizer? Things look a little different then.”

Chapeye's inner conflict with his longstanding pacifism unfolds when he and his family stop by a village heading westward and he meets an elderly local. This man, along with other locals of his generation with military experience, is readying to enlist. By contrast, the man's son has returned to the village, hoping to lay low and avoid military conscription officers. When Chapeye asks the son if he can give his family a ride to continue their journey westward, he replies that he doesn't want to be stopped at a military checkpoint.

“It's easy to hide behind the abstract idea that ‘the more weapons there are, the more war there'll be' when you yourself are safe.”

Chapeye's writing resists easy blame when it comes to such social issues, always choosing instead to look deeply, contextualize, and find empathy, if possible. On the son's choice, he says: “I just wouldn't want that to be me.”

“I struggle more with the men who have bought documents claiming a fake disability or obtained a fake guardianship of a disabled person and now sip beer from bottles with ‘Heroes don't die' on the labels,” he adds.

Chapeye approaches such reflections with an understanding of his personal limitations. More than once he conveys in the book how he is in awe of the Ukrainian men who chose to come back from abroad and enlist, confessing that he likely would have lacked the courage to make that sacrifice himself. He admits that initially, he even suspected these stories were state propaganda until encountering those men firsthand proved otherwise.

Recognizing one's own limitations — and those of others — during wartime can also give rise to many different manifestations of guilt, according to Chapeye. Ukrainian mothers can experience remorse over their perceived insufficient contribution to national defense. Volunteers confront the dissonance of supporting the war effort without fighting on the front line. Soldiers serving in the rear struggle to compare their setbacks with those who are in trenches, while others endure survivor's guilt, mourning fallen brothers-in-arms.

“This multilevel nature of guilt is, for me, one of the most bizarre and unexpected psychological phenomena of war. Russia attacked Ukraine, but Ukrainians are the ones to feel ashamed. Everyone in Ukraine talks about this,” he writes.

War rewrites the order of things. What we do in its long shadow shapes the peace that might follow — if we survive to see it. Once condemned as weakness, certain gestures reveal unexpected strength: in Ukraine's rather patriarchal society, Chapeye notes, it is no longer “wrong” for men to cry. If anything, it is a sign of strength and refusal to grow numb to the daily horrors of war.

For Chapeye, it is the thoughts of his children that bring him to tears most easily. When the war began, his family sought refuge in Germany while Chapeye stayed behind to serve in the military. Technology keeps them connected, but screens cannot bridge the ache of their physical absence — an ache that only grows sharper when they visit him in dreams.

“You rush to pick them up in your arms, to hold them close so you can feel them, but your children melt away, and you wake up in tears. Your children are gone, and you are in a f**king military uniform, with a f**king assault rifle under you, sleeping in some f**king train car,” Chapeye writes.

Chapeye is not the only servicemember who is in despair over being separated from his family. One of Chapeye's brothers-in-arms — a “tough-looking guy with an assault rifle,” as he describes him — reminds him of this in a delicate, unexpected way: he hugs Chapeye, and asks him to remember that he is not alone in his feelings.

At the same time, all this suffering makes it especially difficult for those serving in the military to emotionally connect with those who are not. Chapeye describes in the book feeling “a sharp pang of dislike” when he sees an acquaintance on Facebook post about searching for an apartment for his family in Kyiv, while Chapeye himself can't see his own kids, who are abroad. (Chapeye's own family has since returned to Ukraine.)

“Tens of thousands of people who were less fortunate have already died to make his pleasant life possible,” he writes. 

""Ordinary People Don't Carry Machine Guns"" stands as a timely, clear-eyed account of the sacrifices Ukrainians have had to make to defend their homeland. While many of Ukraine's Western supporters reach for grand myths of tireless, unbreakable warriors, Chapeye counters with a necessary reminder: Ukrainians will continue to fight for as long as they can, but that fight is slowly breaking them.

Perhaps no one is better placed to say so than a pacifist in military uniform. Such a person doesn't romanticize war — they loathe it. Yet, they choose to serve. They serve because they understand that peace, if it means anything, sometimes must be defended and not simply wished into existence.

Unlike the “abstract pacifists” Chapeye criticizes in the book, the pacifist in military uniform knows that peace is not the absence of war — it is about protecting justice, human dignity, and national sovereignty. When those are threatened by another country invading, taking up arms is not a rejection of pacifist ideology: it is the refusal to let senseless violence prevail.

Increased spending on defense and a new Russian conscription law are signs of the Kremlin's increasingly aggressive posture and preparations for future conflict with Europe and NATO states, according to analysts.

As Ukraine and its Western allies continue to sound the alarm about Moscow's long-term intentions, Russian lawmakers introduced a bill on July 22 that would allow year-round conscription.

If passed, the new system would replace the traditional bi-annual draft, enabling continuous replenishment of military personnel.

The development comes after recent Ukrainian warnings of a massive increase in Russian rearmament spending, and the creation last year of new military districts which experts say are potential preparations for future wars outside of Ukraine.

""All of these components — new military districts, changes in mobilization and defence spending — are suggesting that Russia is preparing for a protracted war, not just in Ukraine but also against NATO,"" Kateryna Stepanenko, Russia deputy team lead and analyst at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), told the Kyiv Independent.

Russia effectively has two armies — a conscript army and a contract army.

Russia's conscript army is the country's standing armed forces that are required to defend Russia itself. To maintain this force, the Kremlin currently conducts conscription twice a year, in spring and fall, requiring eligible men to serve for one year.

But conscripts by law are not allowed to be sent abroad to fight wars in foreign countries.

Instead, the Kremlin has simply paid people to fight in Ukraine, offering huge sign-up bonuses to encourage people to volunteer and sign contracts, a method which, up to now, has managed to replenish the huge losses the army has incurred, but which many experts say is unsustainable.


""If this law is passed, it can be considered a stealth mobilization."" 
    

Throughout the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Putin has steered clear of a full mobilization, conscious of the domestic backlash it would create.

But the Kremlin appears to be now taking at least partial steps towards this.

""Russia over the past couple of years has been dedicating a lot of resources and time to changing its mobilization system, digitizing it, making it more comprehensive, and investing lots of money into military patriotic education,"" Stepanenko said.

And in the latest move, Russian lawmakers introduced a bill on July 22 to allow continuous, year-round conscription on July 22. 

""If this law is passed, it can be considered a stealth mobilization,"" Ukrainian defense expert, Denys Popovych, told the Kyiv Independent.

""There is a 99% chance that this law will be passed, because it was submitted by (Andriy) Kartopolov, who is (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's man, his mouthpiece. What he submits will largely be approved, and is agreed with Putin,"" he added.

These changes in mobilization laws are, according to Kyiv, being accompanied by dramatic defense spending plans. 

According to Ukraine's intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, Moscow plans to spend $1.1 trillion on rearmament by 2036, an unprecedented investment since the collapse of the Soviet Union.

""There is a total mobilization of politics, economy, and society of the Russian Federation to be ready for the upcoming large-scale war,"" Budanov said during the annual meeting of Ukrainian ambassadors on July 22.


""The Kremlin's theory of victory is that it can outlast Western support and Ukrainian resistance.""
    

As part of this reform, Russia has already created two new military districts — Moscow and Leningrad — and is preparing to form additional divisions and military units. Budanov said the Kremlin's goal is not just regional domination but a reshaping of the global order.

Asked why Budanov specifically mentioned the year 2036, Stepanenko believes that this date aligns with the Kremlin's tendency to avoid abrupt or sudden decisions, understanding that a rapid and general mobilization of the population or a sudden pivot to increase defense spending could ""upset the Russian people.""

""I think mobilization is probably the most concerning issue for Russians, as many of them are extremely worried about being mobilized or having family members mobilized,"" she said.

""So the Kremlin is taking a long-term approach. The Kremlin's theory of victory is that it can outlast Western support and Ukrainian resistance.""

Another factor in Russia's desire to increase mobilization is simply that it might not be able to afford to pay the huge sums necessary to sign contracts for much longer.

""Russia's budget is currently bursting at the seams,"" Popovych said. ""Many industries and transport sectors have collapsed due to sanctions. Therefore, they will obviously not have enough money to recruit people for the war, as they are doing now.""

Currently, Western sanctions against Russia are still in place, and the EU has just announced its 18th package.Russia's defense spending has already overtaken that of all European countries combined. 

In 2024, its military budget surged by 42% to $462 billion, surpassing Europe's collective defense expenditure of $457 billion, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies.


""One of the Kremlin's objectives is to defeat NATO, seize Ukraine and Belarus, and restore the Russian empire — then become a world hegemon.""
    

""It does seem that Russia is trying to establish some sort of wartime economy. There are a couple of indications besides the increase in things ending on defense,"" Stepanenko said.

According to Stepanenko, the Kremlin is pursuing a strategy of deeper nationalization and centralization to sustain and scale military production. 

""The Kremlin is currently trying to prepare Russians to embrace more economic setbacks and more economic sacrifices in favor of this kind of long-term defense spending,"" Stepanenko said.

Some regional governments are beginning to prioritize defense spending and military contracts, even if it means reducing civilian programs.

""Russia will save money by cutting social spending to develop its military-industrial sector. We know from the history of wars that whenever the military sector develops, social spending is cut,"" Popovych said.

Stepanenko said the Kremlin wants to change the world order ""to essentially displace the Western world order.""

""The Kremlin is posing itself as the new world power, so it's trying to expand its influence in Latin America, Asia, and Africa,"" she said.

""One of the Kremlin's objectives is to defeat NATO, seize Ukraine and Belarus, and restore the Russian empire — then become a world hegemon.""

And some Western leaders are taking the threat seriously — Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on July 25 that Russia will likely be ready for a potential military confrontation with Europe within the next two years.

The Hyundai Inster, a small EV now available in Europe, earned four stars on the Euro New Car Assessment Program (NCAP). Here, it is crashed in the full width rigid barrier test at 50 kilometres an hour.Supplied

Canadians don't want to let American tastes dictate which cars do and don't end up on dealership lots, a new poll shows. But, opening up our streets to smaller, cleaner cars from Europe opens a fresh can of regulatory worms. 

The good news is that these issues are entirely manageable; they need not be an excuse for inaction. As Tim Reuss, chief executive officer of the Canadian Automotive Dealers Association (CADA) and the former head of Mercedes-Benz Canada said changing the status quo comes down to “political will and paperwork.” 

First, remember that Canadian vehicle homologation rules – crash safety and emissions standards – are closely aligned with those in the United States. Because the cost to homologate a car for Canada alone is prohibitively expensive given our relatively small market (fewer than two million new vehicles sold annually) we typically only get access to cars homologated for America. 

Cue the world's tiniest violin and shed a tear for all compact electric vehicles, fun hatchbacks, reasonably-priced station wagons, brilliantly deranged MPVs (multi-purpose vehicle), lightweight sports cars and other automotive oddities we could've had if it weren't for America. Sigh.

An online poll conducted in June by environmental think tank Clean Energy Canada asked if Canada should allow European-approved vehicles into our country. 

Doing so, the questionnaire rightly explained, “would increase the availability of car brands and models in Canada, including smaller, more affordable electric vehicles.”

To that question, 70 per cent of Canadians said yes, European-approved vehicles should be allowed for sale here. The idea proved popular across the political spectrum, with a majority of voters from all three major political parties in favour.

(In a totally anecdotal survey of the top-rated comments by readers of my previous story on the subject, many of you are in favour of it too. Some of you also thought Canada should drop or lower tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, but that's a whole other can of worms, albeit one worth looking into.)

As it stands, it's little wonder Canadian car buyers are looking for more choice. New vehicles have become ridiculously expensive and bloated with unnecessary features. At the same time, Western automakers seem to have abandoned the idea of offering an affordable ($25,000 to $40,000) long-range EV any time soon.

Crucially, the idea here isn't for European automotive standards to replace North American ones; instead, both should be accepted.

It's not a new policy proposal, but it is one that CADA has recently advocated for. Reuss said almost all car manufacturers – including American ones – support it. Consumers would see more new models hitting showrooms almost immediately and new brands would likely enter the market as well, Ruess said.

Now, the not-so-good news for Canadian drivers who have been hungrily eyeing the global smorgasbord of tasty new cars available in Europe.

A spokesperson for Transport Canada confirmed the department is aware of recent calls to allow vehicles homologated by its international counterparts. 

But, here's the rub: “The certification requirements of other jurisdictions may not be sufficient to meet the safety needs of Canadian road users due to Canada's distinct driving environment,” wrote Sau Sau Liu, senior communications advisor for Transport Canada, adding that Canadian crash safety standards are tailored to the larger vehicles typically found on our roads.

America's Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) – with which the Canada Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (CMVSS) are closely aligned – outlines a series of crash tests that are generally performed at slightly higher speeds and meant to simulate heavier vehicles compared to the crash tests mandated by the Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) safety standards. 

However, ECE crash standards are better in some cases, particularly on pedestrian safety. While the U.S. has only recently woken up to the need to protect those outside of vehicles, Europe has long mandated comprehensive pedestrian impact testing.

The choice should be up to drivers. While I personally wouldn't want to drive the new Fiat Topolino quadracycle – little more than a glorified golf cart – on city streets surrounded by giant pickups, I would feel safe in the compact new Renault 5 electric hatchback. 

Anything that's safe enough for the speed-limitless sections of German autobahn and perilous switchbacks of the Italian Alps should be safe enough for Canada.

Besides, if North American vehicles are considered too gigantic and heavy to safely share the road with reasonably sized European ones, the correct solution isn't to forgo European-approved cars; it is to reign in the supersized excess of the largest and most dangerous pickups and SUVs in North America.

Air Canada on Tuesday reported profit of $186-million for the three months ending on June 30, compared with $410-million in the year-earlier periodAdrian Wyld/The Canadian Press

Air Canada AC-T saw an 11-per-cent decline in U.S-bound seat sales in the second quarter amid trade and sovereignty tensions spurred by U.S. President Donald Trump.

Canada's largest airline posted a 2-per-cent rise in overall operating revenue as travellers chose domestic or overseas destinations. 

“In the transborder market, we continue to see less demand for trips to the U.S.,” said Mark Galardo, Air Canada's chief commercial officer.

Airlines are using AI to set ticket prices. Here's how you can avoid price manipulation when booking flights

Air Canada on Tuesday reported profit of $186-million for the three months ending on June 30, compared with $410-million in the year-earlier period. Adjusted for a tax settlement, profit was $207-million, or 60 cents a share, compared with $369-million (98 cents) in the same period a year ago.

Analysts had expected adjusted profit of 72 cents a share. 

The Montreal-based carrier's results were weighed down by rising operating expenses, a weak Canadian dollar and a 16-per-cent rise in labour costs. 

Investors reacted to the results, released on Monday night, by sending Air Canada's share price down by more than 14 per cent in midday trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 

“This second quarter was not business as usual,” Mr. Galardo told analysts on an earnings conference call on Tuesday morning. “We navigated through a period of significant economic and geopolitical uncertainty and we contended with reduced demand for transborder travel.”

Other headwinds included reduced demand for travel to the Middle East and India amid geopolitical turmoil, increased competition in China and Hong Kong, and currency fluctuations, he said.

Mr. Galardo said the drop in U.S. travel was expected and accompanied by an 8-per-cent decline in seat capacity and better per-seat yields. 

Canadians have adopted an elbows-up stance against Mr. Trump's threats to make Canada the 51st state and crush its industries with tariffs. They have shunned U.S. visits and products and lauded campaigns to spend their money at home.

According to Statistics Canada, the number of Canadians crossing the border by plane has fallen through the first five months of the year, and is down in April and May by 14 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively, compared to a year ago. Trips by car, which comprise three-quarters of travel to the U.S., fell by more than 35 per cent for these months. 

‘Elbows up' vacations a boon for Canada's hospitality sector, June data show

The diminished U.S. market is significant for Canada's airlines because it was the destination for 75 per cent of all trips abroad by Canadians in 2024. 

Air Canada responded to the reduced demand by deploying its fleet to domestic and overseas destinations, adding flights to Naples, Prague and Manila.

Sales to Transatlantic and Latin American destinations rose by 5 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively, while domestic seat sales rose by 3 per cent, from a year ago. 

Mr. Galardo said Air Canada is seeing a rise in demand for off-season seats to southern Europe as travellers seek mild temperatures and smaller crowds. 

Still, Judith Coates, owner of travel agency Wired For Travel in Orillia, Ont., said she has not seen a large drop-off in demand for travel on U.S. cruise ships, which comprise most of her business there. 

“People have been asking, ‘What are other cruises we can take instead?' So, Mediterranean or Caribbean islands. That would be the only thing I have seen,” Ms. Coates said from Anchorage, Alaska. 

“What I have noticed a lot is every American that we encounter apologizes to us,” she said. “So the people in the U.S. are quite happy that they we are there and they apologize for the way they see that we are being treated.”

Not shy about travelling to the U.S.? Flight prices have dropped to some destinations

Air Canada's overall passenger revenue, which excludes cargo and other sources, rose by 1 per cent on a 2.5-per-cent increase in seat capacity. The planes, on average, were 85-per-cent full, little changed from the year-earlier period. 

“We made the right early calls to match our capacity to the evolving demand landscape,” Mr. Galardo said. 

Opinion: Domestic travel in Canada isn't as accessible as we like to think

Meanwhile, Air Canada's 10,000-plus flight attendants are voting until Aug. 5 on a strike mandate as the Canadian Union of Public Employees negotiates with management for a new collective agreement. 

A strike mandate is intended to give the union more power at the bargaining table, and does not mean a work stoppage is inevitable. 

Air Canada said the vote is part of the usual negotiating process. 

Air Canada's 5,400 pilots last year approved a contract that provides 42-per-cent raises over four years.

World Vision Canada chief operating officer Sumair Mirza in a community in Elgeyo Marakwet County, Kenya, talking to children and families in February, 2025.HANDOUT

When Sumair Mirza took on the role of World Vision Canada's chief operating officer in 2018, it was with a mission to help the humanitarian organization buck the broader industry trend of declining charitable giving.

For more than 60 years, Mississauga-based World Vision Canada operated like many Canadian non-profits, focusing on storytelling to tap into donors' beliefs, values and goodwill. But modern-day donors want to see the tangible impact of their contributions: Where did those dollars actually go?

World Vision Canada was seeking more business rigour – and Mr. Mirza was well-suited to the task given his background in finance, including a decade at GE Capital and nearly three years at Element Fleet Management, before creating his own digital consulting and software development agency, Convergent Labs. 

His assignment was to transform World Vision Canada, the country's largest private relief, advocacy and development agency, into a data-driven digital powerhouse – an approach largely unheard of in the charity sector at the time. 

Mr. Mirza's first job was to recruit tech talent, which to him meant hitting the road to tell people in person about World Vision Canada's goal to challenge the charity sector's status quo and proving that non-profits can be as innovative and efficient as any tech start-up.

“I wanted to tell the story of rewiring the entire organization and hopefully inspire their hearts,” he said.

Data and digital technologies played a critical role in World Vision Canada's evolution. Although the organization had decades' worth of data, it was scattered across spreadsheets, random documents and different teams.

Mr. Mirza said the organization hadn't figured out how to effectively compile and analyze the data and use it to communicate World Vision Canada's on-the-ground impact to donors. It's an important piece of the puzzle, given that 73 per cent of donors would be more likely to donate if they had access to the charity's impact results from the previous year, according to Canada Helps. 

The technology World Vision Canada needed didn't exist, so Mr. Mirza's team developed it. Following internal restructuring that included layoffs, Mr. Mirza hired top-tier digital talent to organize and analyze vast amounts of underutilized data into a cohesive view, which helped address donor concerns. The team built Real Impact 360, a centralized, back-end data management system that tracks and analyzes impact data using artificial intelligence and machine learning.

A new front-end system, World Vision 360, uses that data to communicate personalized reporting snapshots to donors. The AI-powered system helps manage more than 700 projects annually. World Vision Canada says it's the first organization in Canada's charity sector to build its own tech-enabled system.

“The charity sector has an allergic reaction to data,” said Kate Bahen, managing director at Charity Intelligence Canada, a group that assesses the finances and impact of Canadian charities.

“I've never seen anyone else do it quite at this level,” she said. “World Vision's score was so high last year, it broke our back end.” 

Charity Intelligence Canada evaluates charities based on their public reporting of activities, outputs and outcomes. The group's scoring system only goes up to 200 points, but World Vision Canada surpassed that, earning 207 points, owing to top marks in categories such as results reporting, financial transparency and impact. The average score is 111 points – and years ago World Vision Canada had a score of 87. Quality data and robust reporting helped boost its ranking.

“It's gone from being average to one of the best in Canada,” Ms. Bahen said.

Today, more non-profits are starting to experiment and launch pilots to determine how to harness the power of AI and data to achieve a greater impact, according to Jas Jaaj, global AI markets ecosystems and alliances leader and managing partner at Deloitte Canada.

“AI is an equalizer,” he said. “It's empowering smaller organizations or non-profits that have limited resources to punch above their weight and do more with less.”

For example, Mr. Jaaj serves on the board of Lift Impact Partners, a Vancouver-based non-profit that supports social purpose organizations in their growth. The group is currently developing a platform powered by generative AI to help other non-profits streamline outreach, register clients and generate analyses to enhance decision-making. 

“Over the last few years, they have been heavily looking into AI to have a bigger impact,” he said. 

Many non-profits are following suit: According to a 2024 survey from tech firm Twilio, 58 per cent of non-profits reported using AI in their digital communications, compared to 47 per cent of business-to-consumer companies in the private sector. The survey also stated that 68 per cent of non-profits were using AI for data analysis.

World Vision Canada's improved data and reporting have helped it land more donors and win grants. 

The organization raised a record $503-million in revenue for its 2023 fiscal year, largely from donated cash and goods and grant funding. The number was down slightly to $468.3-million in fiscal 2024, which World Vision Canada attributes to declining foreign aid and Canadians' cautious spending amid the rising cost of living and growing economic uncertainties.

Employee engagement has also improved significantly since the tech-driven restructuring. According to World Vision Canada, internal employee engagement scores jumped to 77 per cent based on its latest survey in March, up from 60 per cent in 2018. 

“The sector needs to reform – we've got to continue to move forward and not just be what has always been,” Mr. Mirza said.

More than 20 provincial-level administrations in China now offer childcare subsidies. But analysts are skeptical that they will be able to reverse the declining population or spur spending.

The Chinese government will offer parents subsidies of 3,600 yuan ($500, €429) per child under the age of three per year, Beijing's state media said Monday.

China's population has declined for three consecutive years, the world's second most populous nation — after India — is facing an emerging demographic crisis.

The number of births in 2024 — 9.54 million — was half as many as in 2016, the year that ended its one-child policy that was in place for more than three decades.

Marriage rates in China have also hit a record low. Young couples put off having babies due to the high cost of raising children and career concerns.

More than 20 provincial-level administrations in China now offer childcare subsidies, according to official data.

In March, Hohhot, the capital of Inner Mongolia in northern China, started giving families money to have more children. Couples with three or more children can get up to 100,000 yuan for each new baby.

In Shenyang, in northeastern Liaoning province, local authorities give families who have a third child 500 yuan per month until the child turns three.

In order to create a ""fertility-friendly society"", China's southwestern Sichuan province is proposing to increase marriage leave from 5 to 25 days, and more than double the current 60-day maternity leave to 150 days.

Analysts said the subsidies are a positive step, but warned they won't be enough on their own to reverse China's population decline or lift its sluggish domestic spending.

Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, told Reuters that the new subsidy showed the government had recognized the ""serious challenge"" that low fertility poses to the economy.

Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics, said the policy marked a ""major milestone"" in terms of direct handouts to households and could lay the groundwork for more fiscal transfers in the future.

But he also said the sums were too small to have a ""near-term impact on the birth rate or consumption.""

""For young couples who just got married and already have a baby, it might actually encourage them to consider having a second child,"" Wang Xue, a mother to a nine-year-old son from Beijing, told AFP.

But she said the new measures would not be enough to convince her to have a second child.

""Having one child is manageable, but if I had two, I might feel a bit of (financial) pressure,"" the 36-year-old told AFP.

A bus with Hindu pilgrims onboard collided with a truck loaded with cooking gas cylinders in eastern India, killing the religious devotees. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the accident ""extremely tragic.""

 A bus crash in eastern India left at least 18 Hindu pilgrims dead, a local lawmaker said Tuesday. 

The crash occurred in the city of Deoghar in the India state of Jharkhand.

The bus carrying the pilgrims collided with a truck loaded with gas cylinders, killing the religious devotees onboard.  

""18 devotees lost their lives due to a bus and truck accident,"" local Jharkhand lawmaker Nishikant Dubey wrote on social media platform X.

Dubey is a member of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). 

Deoghar is a considered a holy city for Hindus in Jharkhand and is the location of a major temple. The city receives an influx of visitors during the sacred month of Shravan. 

Modi also commented on the accident, calling it ""extremely tragic."" He expressed his ""deepest condolences"" to the families of the victims.

Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren said authorities are ""providing relief and rescue operations along with medical facilities for the injured."" It's unclear how many people survived the crash, but Indian media reported that the bus has 32 seats. 

India's roads are considered some of the world's deadliest, with speeding and driving on the wrong side of the road seen as the top reasons for accidents.

Much more than a festival of metal music, mud and beer, Wacken is a unique community and cultural experience. Here are five things you need to know about W:O:A.

The Wacken Open Air festival, also known as W:O:A, began in 1990 as a small festival with just 800 rock fans and a few local metal bands. The initial venue was a former gravel pit on the outskirts of the village of Wacken northwest of the Germany city of Hamburg. Today, the four-day event is one of the biggest and best-known metal festivals in the world, attended by around 185,000 fans from over 80 countries.

The festival usually sells out within hours, although tickets are getting more expensive — €333 ($386) this year — and the event is becoming increasingly commercialized. Nevertheless, Wacken has become a meeting place for the metal community. When in Wacken, be prepared to encounter the familiar ""devils horn"" metalhead salute — a raised fist with outstretched index and pinky fingers — as well as the familiar battle cry: ""Wackeeeeeen!""

During the festival week, the village of Wacken transforms into a metropolis of around 95,000 people. This includes fans, tens of thousands of crew members and helpers as well as hundreds of musicians and media from all over the world. The 240-hectare site has a completely independent infrastructure with over 1,300 toilets, hundreds of showers, its own electricity and water supply, waste collection and even a small police station. There are also mobile medical stations, field kitchens, shuttle buses and a sophisticated traffic management system.

Even in heavy rain and mud — a Wacken classic — the show goes on. Tons of wood chips as a base, a drainage system and local farmers, who pull stuck vehicles out of the mud with their tractors, make the festival possible even under difficult weather conditions. But back in 2023, the mud gained the upper hand: the festival site was largely impassable, forcing around 235,000 fans to turn back. The festival was almost canceled altogether.

Whether day or night, many metalheads traditionally maintain a steady flow of beer. To prevent the taps from running dry, an underground beer pipeline was built in 2017. It connects central tanks with several taps on the site and can transport up to 10,000 liters (2,642 gallons) of beer per hour. This saves on transportation, protects the roads and ensures supplies are uninterrupted.

Culinary offerings at the festival range from currywurst fries to vegan falafel pockets, and the food trucks can be found throughout the festival grounds. A new payment system has been in place since 2022. The festival wristband also contains a chip that can be topped up with a debit or credit card at numerous stations. This can be used to pay throughout the festival site. Cash or card payments aren't possible.

Of course, metal takes center stage at Wacken — in all its forms. The big acts play on three main stages named ""Faster,"" ""Harder"" and ""Louder."" Major acts performing this year include Guns N' Roses, Papa Roach, Machine Head and Gojira, among others. Fans gather in front of the stages on what's known as the Infield, also referred to as the ""Holy Ground"" or ""Holy Field.""

But the festival also offers a variety of areas with different events and activities. In the Wackinger Village, for example, fans will find jugglers, knights, fire shows and medieval bands. The food is also a bit different here and includes hearty dishes such as suckling pig, oxen on a spit, stews and soups, as well as medieval-style desserts and drinks like mead or fruit wines.

Another area known as Wasteland has a post-apocalyptic design, with flame throwers and scrap metal buildings reminiscent of ""Mad Max.” A group of artists known as the ""Wasteland Warriors"" provides the apocalyptic flair with fire and smoke. The area also features a stage with performers playing mainly industrial music.

The Beergarden is a popular meeting place for metalheads who want to take it a little easier. Playing here is the fire department band ""Wacken Firefighters,"" who deliver a feel-good atmosphere with brass band versions of well-known rock classics.

Other stages also feature comedy, spoken word, metal yoga, wrestling and readings.

Beyond all the noise, one thing is certain: Wacken sees itself not only as a festival, but also as a platform for social and culture outreach. A central element is the Wacken Foundation, which has existed since 2009. It aims to support up-and-coming bands from the metal and hard rock scene worldwide. The foundation provides financial support for studio recordings, tours and instruments. The money is donated by fans and festival operators, among others.

Of particular importance is the Wacken Metal Battle — a global competition in which young bands from over 30 countries compete against each other. Competing bands hail from far and wide, including countries such as Trinidad & Tobago and Botswana. The prize is an opportunity to play on one of the festival's big stages. For many, it's the first step towards an international career.

The festival also hosts the Wacken Music Camp, which brings together young people from all over Germany to write, rehearse and perform their own songs. Under professional guidance, they're provided with a creative space where they can write to their hearts' content.

The festival also includes health-related elements, such as campaigns against blood cancer in which festival attendees are encouraged to register as potential stem cell donors. With actions like these, Wacken shows that even loud music can make a quiet statement — and that support for worthy causes is part and parcel of the metal scene.

The ICJ's landmark ruling says there is an international human right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment.

A new ruling from the World Court provides climate activists new tools for demanding accountability.

On July 23, in a stunning 140 page advisory opinion, the International Court of Justice (ICJ, or World Court) held for the first time that there is a human right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment, and countries have a legal obligation to protect the climate from greenhouse gas emissions. The ICJ found that climate change poses “an existential problem of planetary proportions that imperils all forms of life and the very health of our planet.”

“In a historic breakthrough, the ICJ held unanimously that those who did the least to fuel the climate crisis deserve protection, reparations and a future,” Richard Harvey, legal counsel for Greenpeace International, told Truthout. “The court has blocked every loophole beloved of polluter states and corporations: States must phase out fossil fuel production and consumption. They must regulate the industry and cease to subsidize it.”

Harvey noted: “All 15 Judges held the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment is a binding norm of international law and a precondition for the enjoyment of other human rights.” They include the right to life; the right to health; the right to an adequate standard of living; the right to privacy, family and home; and the rights of women, children, and Indigenous peoples.

This was the ICJ's fifth unanimous advisory opinion of the 29 it has issued in the past 80 years. It was the court's first decision on climate change and its largest case ever. While not binding, the opinion will invariably be cited by litigants in national, regional, and international courts who seek to hold states legally accountable for failing to prevent significant harm to the environment by not exercising due diligence or all means at their disposal.

More than 100 states and organizations argued before the ICJ from December 2 to 13, 2024, in this landmark case initiated by Pacific Islander law students. The grassroots movement that the students launched had persuaded the UN General Assembly to request an advisory opinion from the ICJ.

On March 29, 2023, UN General Assembly Resolution 77/276 directed the ICJ to render an advisory opinion on the obligations of states under international law to protect the climate from human-caused emissions of greenhouse gases. The resolution also asked the court to weigh in on the legal consequences for states that failed to protect the climate and caused significant harm to present and future generations and other states.

The court cited the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that about 3.3 to 3.6 billion people are highly vulnerable to climate change. The IPCC found that in all regions, increasing extreme heat events have caused human mortality and morbidity (ill health), and climate-related diseases are on the rise. Increasing weather and extreme climate events have exposed millions of people to reduced water security and acute food insecurity. Homes and infrastructure have been destroyed, and the climate crisis has caused a loss of income, property, and human health. In addition, the IPCC established that the least developed countries and small island states are responsible for much lower per capita emissions of greenhouse gases than the global average.

“While climate change is caused by cumulative [greenhouse gas] emissions, it is scientifically possible to determine each State's total contribution to global emissions, taking into account both historical and current emissions,” the court found.

The ICJ ruled on the binding effects of provisions in the climate change treaties, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC), its Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement.

But the court also determined that even states that are not parties to those treaties are bound by the entire corpus of international law, including international human rights law and customary international law, as well as well-established principles of state responsibility. Customary international law arises from the consistent and general practice of states, which is accepted by states as legally binding.

Customary law includes a duty to prevent significant harm to the environment by acting with due diligence. In addition, states have a duty to cooperate with each other in good faith to prevent significant harm to the climate system and other parts of the environment.

According to the ICJ ruling, all states are responsible to regulate businesses within their jurisdiction for harm caused by their emissions regardless of where the harm occurs.

Interpretation of climate obligations must be guided by intergenerational equity, which means that “present generations are trustees of humanity tasked with preserving dignified living conditions and transmitting them to future generations,” the court said.

When climate change leads to life-endangering conditions, the people facing those conditions often flee to another country and are sometimes prevented from returning to their own. The court cited state obligations under the principle of non-refoulement which forbids states from sending climate refugees to a country where there are substantial grounds to believe they face a real risk of irreparable harm to the right to life.

“States are subject to the duty to prevent significant harm either where no harm has yet been caused but the risk of future significant harm exists, or where some harm has already been caused and there exists a risk of further significant harm,” the court concluded. “For a finding of State responsibility, what is required is an internationally wrongful act and its attribution to a State, whether the act causes harm or not.” It is necessary to prove causation in order to receive reparations.

The court set forth a two-part test to determine whether a breach of climate obligations caused damage to other states: (1) whether a specific climate impact can be attributed to climate change and (2) whether damage caused by climate change can be attributed to a particular state or group of states in a specific case.

Remedies for the breach of a legal duty might include orders to cease and not repeat the wrongdoing. Reparations that could be ordered are restitution, compensation and/or satisfaction (apologies or education of the society about climate change).

A state need not be injured in order to invoke the legal responsibility of another state if the obligation arises under customary international law. In that case, the obligation “is owed to the international community as a whole,” the court noted. But a non-injured state may not claim reparations for itself.

“Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide,” attorney Harvey said. “Every state, irrespective of whether they are a party to the Paris Agreement, must act ‘to respect and ensure the effective enjoyment of human rights by taking necessary measures to protect the climate system and other parts of the environment.' States must use all means at their disposal to prevent activities carried out within their jurisdiction or control from causing significant harm to the climate system and other parts of the environment.”

The United States is the world's largest historical emitter of greenhouse gases, and the second largest current emitter behind China. During his first term, Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, in which 196 countries set a temperature goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. Although Joe Biden rejoined the agreement in 2021, Trump once again removed the U.S. from the Paris Agreement on January 20, 2025.

Trump also issued executive orders revoking most of Biden's executive orders on energy and climate change, encouraging the rapid development of fossil fuel resources and removing regulatory obstacles, and preventing wind farms from being built on federal lands and waters.

In May, 22 young people between the ages of 7 and 25 filed a lawsuit in U.S. district court in Montana, challenging three of Trump's executive orders. The plaintiffs are alleging that the orders violate their Fifth Amendment rights to life and liberty, and that Trump exceeded his authority by trying to countermand the Clean Air Act. Nineteen Republican-led states filed a motion to intervene in order to defend Trump's “drill, baby, drill” program. Eva Lighthiser, the 19-year-old lead plaintiff, said in a press release, “Trump's fossil fuel orders are a death sentence for my generation.”

Earlier this month, the Inter-American Court of Human rights issued an advisory opinion which found that states have an obligation under international human rights law to prevent harms from climate change.

In May 2024, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea concluded that carbon dioxide released by burning fossil fuels constitutes marine pollution and ruled that states have legal obligations to mitigate the resulting harms.

As of June, nearly 3,000 climate cases have been filed in nearly 60 countries, according to the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment in London.

“It's hard to overstate how momentous this ruling is,” Wesley Morgan, research associate with the Institute for Climate Risk and Response at the University of New South Wales, told ABC News in Australia. The holdings of the ICJ will invariably be cited in climate litigation around the world.

“This case, which started in a Pacific classroom, has taken the world by storm. Unlike a typhoon or hurricane which injures the poorest and weakest, this case will reverberate from the boardrooms to the courtrooms,” attorney Harvey told Truthout.

International law, the ICJ noted, “has an important but ultimately limited role in resolving this problem. A complete solution to this daunting, and self-inflicted, problem requires the contribution of all fields of human knowledge, whether law, science, economics or any other.” The court hopes its conclusions “will allow the law to inform and guide social and political action to address the ongoing climate crisis.”

But justice is a constant struggle. As recommended by Trump's blueprint, Project 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency is urging the repeal of the EPA's 2009 finding that greenhouse gas emissions constitute a threat to human health and the environment.

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

The scientist was detained without explanation upon returning from his brother's wedding in South Korea.

A permanent U.S. resident has been held in detention for the last week without apparent explanation and without access to legal representation, The Washington Post reported on Tuesday.

According to the Post, 40-year-old Tae Heung “Will” Kim was detained by immigration officials at the San Francisco International Airport on July 21 after returning from attending his brother's wedding in Korea. In the week since his detention, he has still not been released despite being a green-card holder who has lived in the United States since the age of five.

Eric Lee, an attorney representing Kim, said he has been unable to contact his client and that Kim's only past brush with the law came back in 2011 when he was ordered to perform community service over a minor marijuana possession charge in Texas.

Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day.

A spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) seemed to suggest in a statement to the Post that this past instance of marijuana possession was enough justification to detain and deport Kim.

“If a green-card holder is convicted of a drug offense, violating their status, that person is issued a Notice to Appear and CBP coordinates detention space with ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] ERO [Enforcement and Removal Operations],” they said. “This alien is in ICE custody pending removal proceedings.”

Lee told the Post that he reached out to CBP to ask whether his client had protections under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments of the United States Constitution that guarantee rights such as the right to an attorney. In response, the CBP official simply told Lee, “No.”

“If the Constitution doesn't apply to somebody who's lived in this country for 35 years and is a green-card holder — and only left the country for a two-week vacation — that means [the government] is basically arguing that the Constitution doesn't apply to anybody who's been in this country for less time than him,” Lee said.

Lee added that it would be particularly uncommon for immigration officials to deport his client based solely on a 2011 marijuana possession charge given that Kim had successfully petitioned to seal the offense from his public record after fulfilling his community service requirements. Because of this, Lee said that Kim's case should easily clear the waiver process that allows officials to overlook past minor offenses that could otherwise be used to justify stripping people of their permanent legal resident status.

Prior to his detention, Kim was pursuing a PhD at Texas A&M University, where he was doing research to help develop a vaccine against Lyme disease.

Immigration enforcement officials under the second Trump administration have been particularly aggressive in trying to deport students who are legally in the United States.

Turkish-born Tufts University student Rümeysa Öztürk was detained for months earlier this year after she was apparently targeted for writing an editorial in her student newspaper critical of the school's refusal to divest from Israel. Russian-born Harvard University scientist Kseniia Petrova, meanwhile, is currently facing deportation after she was charged with allegedly smuggling frog embryos into the United States.

Activists say the government is misleading the public as Canadian weapons flow to Israel despite pledged restrictions.

Rights advocates in Canada are accusing the government of misleading the public by allowing huge amounts of weapons to be sent to Israel despite a pledge to curtail such transfers.

In a new report issued on July 29, a coalition of advocacy groups released new details about the scope of Canadian-made arms exports to Israel amid the country's war on the Gaza Strip.

Using commercial shipping and Israeli import data, the report found that at least 47 shipments of military related components were sent from Canadian weapons manufacturers to Israeli arms companies between October 2023 and July 2025.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

Another 391 shipments containing bullets, military equipment, weapons parts, aircraft components and communication devices were exported to Israel between October 2023 and June 2025, the report said, citing Israeli Tax Authority data.

More than 421,000 bullets also were exported to Israel since the country's bombardment of Gaza began, including a single shipment of 175,000 that was sent in April of this year.

That's only a few months after the Canadian government said it was opposed to Canadian-made weapons being used in Gaza, where Israeli forces have killed tens of thousands of Palestinians.

Rachel Small, the Canada lead at World Beyond War, one of the groups behind the report, told Truthout that the findings expose “one of the biggest propaganda campaigns in Canadian foreign policy in many decades”.

“What we've seen over the past 21 months is, over and over again, Liberal [government] ministers standing in parliament, making public statements, claiming that Canada had paused or restricted or limited or was no longer sending arms to Israel,” Small told Truthout in an interview.

“And while Palestinian families were literally burying their children [in Gaza] … we now know that fighter jet parts literally flew from Halifax to Israel on Air Canada flights, hidden in the cargo underneath passenger seats,” Small said.

“What this report reveals is not bureaucratic oversight; what this looks like is systematic deception. It makes Canada directly complicit in what scholars and organizations all agree is a genocide.”

The report's findings come as Israel faces a fresh wave of global condemnation over its blockade of Gaza, which has led to a starvation crisis across the bombarded coastal enclave.

According to Gaza's Health Ministry, nearly 150 Palestinians have died of hunger since the war began in October 2023, including dozens in recent days.

More than half of those casualties are children, and the United Nations has warned that the number of starvation-linked deaths could rapidly rise unless aid is allowed into the territory in a sustained way.

“What this report reveals is not bureaucratic oversight; what this looks like is systematic deception. It makes Canada directly complicit in what scholars and organizations all agree is a genocide.”

But long before Israel's escalation of its blockade in March, people around the world had been calling on their governments to stop sending weapons to Israel that could be used in deadly attacks on Palestinian civilians in Gaza.

In Canada, Palestinian rights advocates and other civil society groups demanded an arms embargo against Israel and called on the government to uphold its obligations under the UN Arms Trade Treaty.

That pact stipulates that signatories cannot send arms to a country when they have knowledge that those weapons could be used in war crimes, genocide, and attacks on civilians, among other violations of international law.

In March 2024, Canada's parliament passed a non-binding motion urging the government to suspend further arms sales to Israel.

As pressure continued to mount, in September of last year, then-Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly announced that the government had not approved any new export permits for Israel since January 8, 2024.

Joly said Ottawa had suspended “around 30” existing permits. She also said the government was opposed to a planned sale by the United States of Canadian-made weapons parts to Israel that was made public just a few weeks earlier.

“Our policy is clear: We will not have any form of arms or parts of arms be sent to Gaza, period,” Joly told reporters at the time.

Still, human rights advocates immediately questioned why the government didn't suspend all permits that had been granted for weapons destined for Israel.

The report also noted that, under a decades-old defense pact between Canada and the U.S., most Canadian-made weapons and weapons parts do not need permits to be exported to the country's southern neighbor.

That has created what some experts have described as a black hole in terms of reporting requirements — and raised concerns that Canadian weapons components could end up in Israel if they are shipped via the U.S.

In fact, in March, anti-war group Project Ploughshares reported that a Canadian Crown corporation — a government contracting agency — had signed a contract in September 2024 with the U.S. Department of Defense to provide artillery propellants used to launch explosive 155m shells that will be sent to Israel.

“This agreement was finalized while the intensive bombardment of Gaza continued,” Project Ploughshares noted, as well as after Canada announced it was suspending weapons exports to Israel.

Tuesday's report focused on direct military exports from Canada to Israel, not weapons that reach Israel via the U.S.

Canada's foreign affairs department, Global Affairs Canada, did not immediately respond to Truthout's request for comment on the allegations that it is misleading the Canadian public on weapons exports to Israel, or on its general policy on such transfers.

The government's own data shows that Canada exported $13.8 million ($18.9 million Canadian) in direct military supplies and technology to Israel last year.

The weapons were authorized for transfer through 164 permits issued before the January 8 freeze, the government said.

“Global Affairs Canada's approach since January 8, 2024, has been to not issue permits and to suspend a limited number of export permits for military items destined for Israel,” the ministry said in its report on 2024 exports.

“These suspensions allow for further review into whether the authorized items could be used in the ongoing conflict in a manner inconsistent with Canada's foreign policy objectives.”

Tuesday's report calls on the Canadian government to impose a two-way arms embargo that would cancel all existing arms export permits from Canada and prevent Canada from importing weapons from Israel.

That's because advocates say the Canadian government should not be buying weapons marketed as “battle tested” on Palestinians or providing profits to Israeli arms manufacturers.

The report also urges Canada to end indirect weapons transfers to Israel through the U.S., including by requiring “end-use assurances” that no arms sent to the U.S. will end up in Israel.

Corey Balsam, national coordinator of Independent Jewish Voices Canada, another one of the groups involved in the report, said arms embargoes are tools the Canadian government has used before in other circumstances.

“I think the government recognizes that it has a responsibility to stop the arms [to Israel], and that's why they've taken some limited measures. But those measures are obviously insufficient,” Balsam told Truthout.

“We've grown up with this idea of never again post-Holocaust and that's something that we hear politicians in Canada repeating,” he said. “And here we are, just letting this happen, and worse, actually contributing. It's really shameful.”

Balsam added that “if Canada really supports international law and human rights, it needs to be applied across the board”, including to its ally, Israel.

Small also said Canada is at a crossroads.

“I think they are really going to have to choose whether they're going to continue to try to hide the Canada-Israel arms trade … or whether they're going to take action and actually stop the flow of these weapons,” Small said.

“We're not asking them to move mountains,” she added. “It's the bare minimum to [ask them to] stop Canada from being deeply complicit in what I would say is one of the greatest moral crises of our time.”

The war in Ukraine continues to shape China's foreign relations. When European leaders visited Beijing last week to discuss trade and security, the need to find a resolution to the war was one major reason why Chinese-European relations had reached an “inflection point,” according to Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president. For Europe, China's close ties with Russia and perceived support for its war effort have overshadowed ties between China and Europe for more than three years. In Beijing, European Council President António Costa told his counterparts that China should “use its influence on Russia to respect the United Nations Charter and to bring an end of its war of aggression against Ukraine.”

Chinese leaders have made some efforts to help broker a long-term peace deal, but they have not been able to push the conflict closer to a resolution. Although many officials in China want the war to end, Beijing is unlikely to play a leading role in resolving the conflict and achieving a lasting peace in the region. There is no consensus among either Chinese scholars or the general public on how to understand the war—and therefore on how to respond. China's close ties with Russia and its strategic culture have also made it difficult for Beijing to press Moscow to make any concessions that might favor Ukraine. The longer the war drags on, however, the harder it will become to resolve fundamental tensions between China and Europe.

Forty months into the war in Ukraine, members of China's strategic community, including foreign policy and security officials, researchers, and pundits, still have differing views on who is at fault and how leaders in Beijing should respond. Chinese social media platforms have been ablaze with fierce debates between pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian voices.

For some policymakers and citizens, the war is a conflict between two sovereign states in which Russia has violated Ukraine's territorial integrity. Given China's own history of suffering foreign invasions, which has left an indelible mark on its collective memory, many Chinese leaders and citizens empathize with Ukraine. China's diplomatic rhetoric emphasizes its commitment to national sovereignty and independence and its opposition to the use of force against other states—principles that align with the UN Charter and that reflect Ukraine's position. Russia's actions, then, go against international law that China claims to uphold. Moreover, since the Soviet Union's dissolution, China has established positive relations with Ukraine. Ukraine has supplied vital technology to China, most notably jet engines, which has been a boon for China's military and industrial development.

Others see the war as a continuation of the ongoing reorganization of the region after the end of the Cold War. Although the former Soviet republics are now independent states, the ties that bind them together trace back centuries. Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine are particularly close. The process of reconstructing these interconnected societies along newly drawn nation-state borders is much easier said than done—and has been difficult, painful, and often bloody.

For those who view the region in this light, the war in Ukraine is also part of a decades-long conflict in which Western countries have ignored Russia's underlying grievances and concerns. Much like how the Allied treatment of Germany after World War I sowed the seeds of World War II, continuous Western encroachment into Russia's traditional geopolitical space after the Cold War stoked Russian anxieties about encirclement. Once the region achieved relative stability following the Soviet collapse, it became inevitable that Russia would seek to push back against perceived Western pressure.

The 1999 Kosovo war, in which Russian forces briefly seized Kosovo's Pristina airport, was an early sign of Russia's defiance toward NATO. So was the 2014 annexation of Crimea. The subsequent Minsk agreements stopped the fighting in eastern Ukraine for a time, but they could not solve the underlying dispute. Similarly, even if Russia and Ukraine agreed to put down their arms today, the long-term confrontation between Russia and the West would remain unresolved.

Many members of the public in China also empathize with Russia's actions because they see China, too, as the target of Western encirclement and containment. Over the past few decades, particularly in the last ten years, the United States and Europe have ramped up pressure on China politically and economically. Most Chinese believe that the United States does not wish to see the rise of a strong China and is taking concrete steps to hold back China's development. If anything, Chinese citizens often perceive Beijing's diplomacy toward the West as overly restrained and cautious, and they feel a sense of vindication in Russia's bold, even reckless, confrontation with the West.

China's ambiguous stance on the war in Ukraine over the past three years reflects this internal division in Beijing. This isn't just about disagreements from different camps of opinion; instead, most policymakers recognize both perspectives and do not want to fully embrace one at the expense of the other. The 12-point position paper on Ukraine issued by China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in February 2023 embodies this tension. The paper's first principle emphasizes “respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity,” a statement that supports Ukraine's defense of its territory. China has also never recognized Russia's annexation of Crimea nor its claims over four eastern and southern regions of Ukraine. The paper's second principle, however, which states that the “legitimate security concerns of all countries must be taken seriously,” is a veiled show of support for Russia's fears regarding Western pressure, including NATO expansion into what Moscow considers its backyard.

China did not choose this war, and Chinese leaders would likely prefer that it had never happened. Before the outbreak of the conflict in February 2022, China maintained friendly relations with Russia and with Ukraine. Throughout the war, China has continued to trade with both countries: many Western observers focus on China's ties with Russia, but China continues to be Ukraine's largest trading partner despite the disruptions caused by the war. Bilateral trade between China and Ukraine reached nearly $8 billion in 2024.

Although Beijing continues to seek areas of cooperation with Kyiv, Russia still occupies a far more important position in China's overall foreign policy strategy. Russia is a major nuclear power and shares a land border with China that stretches more than 2,600 miles. Annual trade between China and Russia is worth nearly $250 billion. U.S. and European actions and rhetoric in the war have also pushed China and Russia closer. Western leaders often group China and Russia in the same camp, labeling them as part of an “axis,” such as an “axis of autocracies,” which has further sunk Chinese perceptions of Western countries and their governments.

But China's position is hardly absolute. Although Western observers and politicians have seized on the idea of a “no limits partnership” between China and Russia based on Chinese leaders' repeated use of the phrase, this idea overstates the complexity of Chinese-Russian relations. The phrase itself is more of a rhetorical flourish than a description of how Beijing sees Moscow. All foreign relations involve disagreements, differences, and potential conflict—and the bilateral ties between China and Russia are no exception.

China's overall lean toward Russia obscures the challenges and contradictions in Beijing's relationship with Moscow. Complying with Western financial sanctions has made it difficult to settle Chinese-Russian trade. Growth in bilateral trade between China and Russia stagnated in 2024 and declined by almost ten percent in the first half of 2025. And although Western countries have frequently criticized China over allegations that Chinese components have been used in Russian weapons, Ukraine has been extensively deploying Chinese-manufactured drones and using Chinese-made parts for its own drone production.

Theoretically, China is well positioned to bring the countries to the negotiating table. China has taken an increasingly active role in mediating international conflicts in recent years, including negotiating a deal that restored ties between Iran and Saudi Arabia, and brokering peace between Russia and Ukraine would remove a major obstacle to improving China's ties with Europe. Such a breakthrough could also steer the international order toward greater multipolarity and push back against the hardening binary divide between China and Russia on one side and the United States and Western countries on the other. If China were to succeed in bringing the war to an end, it would bolster its international image as a responsible world power.

The reality, however, is that China is unlikely to play a central role in resolving the conflict. Any role it would play would be secondary, at most, and limited to participation. If a multilateral peace process were to take shape, China would gladly take its place at the table if invited. But Russia and Ukraine are the direct parties to this war, and the United States and Europe are indirect participants through military aid. If the two primary belligerents—Russia and Ukraine—are unwilling to stop fighting, and if both remain wary of postwar cease-fire security guarantees, China will not succeed as a third-party mediator.

China's geopolitical ties also constrain its ability to effectively mediate the conflict. China's friendly relations with Russia limit its room to maneuver because Beijing is reluctant to pressure Moscow to make major concessions. China's strategic culture shapes its diplomacy: when a country is broadly aligned with China, Beijing is hesitant to criticize that country's specific policies—even if it privately disagrees. Western nations have repeatedly urged China to use its might to pressure other countries—including Iran, North Korea, and Sudan, along with Russia—but China usually rebuffs these appeals. 

Meanwhile, China's strained ties with the United States and Europe further limit its potential effectiveness as a mediator. Ukraine and Western countries may not want to see China lead peace talks even if it were willing to do so, likely because they believe China would push for a settlement favorable to Russia. If other parties brought an end to the war, Chinese leaders would then hope to contribute to peacekeeping and postwar reconstruction efforts. But China is unlikely to take the lead in bringing the parties to the table in the first place.

To this day, and despite Beijing's insistence that it wants to improve ties with European countries, the war in Ukraine remains the most significant irritant in relations between China and Europe. When the war broke out, China's strategic community viewed it as a significant but distant conflict. It failed to grasp the full magnitude of the conflict's impact on Europe—nor did it foresee how deeply the war would strain China's relations with Europe as a result.

In 2019, the European Union introduced a strategy to view China as a systemic rival, competitor, and partner. But while rivalry and competition are easy, partnership has proved elusive. Beijing increasingly sees U.S. and European characterizations of China as toxic to better relations. China's decision-makers thus have little interest in endorsing U.S. and European positions on the war and sacrificing its relationship with Russia even if doing so would help soothe tensions with Europe. From Beijing's perspective, it is Europe that should correct its misperceptions about China's role in this war—not China that needs to change its strategy.



When the war eventually does end, how it is resolved will shape relations among the former Soviet republics and determine the future of Europe's security architecture. If Russia emerges weakened, some countries in eastern Europe and the Caucasus may pivot further toward the European Union and Turkey, while Central Asian states could pursue more balanced foreign policies to hedge among China, Russia, and other regional players. Conversely, if the war ends in a manner favorable to Russia, Moscow's grip over these regions may tighten.

These divergent outcomes will shape China's strategy. What Beijing ultimately wants is a stable, open, and predictable regional environment that allows it to maintain friendly ties while expanding its trade and economic interests. Both possible future scenarios risk new tensions or even violent conflict in the region, which could strain countries' relations with China and cause more headaches for Beijing. China's strategists are debating how these postwar eventualities might unfold and how China can prepare itself for coming realignments.

China has tried to stay neutral or even passive in a war it neither anticipated nor welcomed. But this approach has not reduced tensions. Instead, and contrary to China's wishes, the war has further entrenched great-power antagonisms among China, Russia, the United States, and Europe. No one has benefited from this outcome—least of all Ukraine. But until the war ends, it remains unlikely that anyone can reverse course.

Following the Israeli and U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear sites and the subsequent Iranian-Israeli cease-fire, another agreement seemed to be close at hand, this time in Gaza. Late last week, however, both the United States and Israel halted their participation in the negotiations, accusing Hamas of a lack of coordination and good faith. Hamas, the Islamist organization and de facto authority in the Gaza Strip, wants the United States to guarantee that the cease-fire will become permanent, Israel to withdraw its military, and the UN and other aid providers to surge humanitarian assistance to Palestinians who are facing mass starvation.

U.S. President Donald Trump's continued deference to Israel and his withdrawal from the talks are a huge mistake. Unless a deal can be made, Trump's desire to preside over a broader regional peace that includes the normalization of diplomatic ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia will be dead in the water. Such a comprehensive regional agreement is desperately needed after 21 months of death and destruction in Gaza and persistent conflict between Israel and much of the Middle East.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his ultranationalist governing coalition, however, have not shown any signs that they are ready to prioritize a durable peace. Even if the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas since October 2023 are released, Netanyahu has emphasized that an end to the war in Gaza is impossible until Hamas is completely disarmed and its leaders exiled. And even then, he wants Israel to maintain security control over Gaza and the West Bank indefinitely. Meanwhile, as Egyptian, Qatari, and U.S. mediators were shuttling back and forth between the Palestinian and Israeli negotiators, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz advanced a plan for relocating Gaza's population into a so-called humanitarian city—what former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert refers to as a “concentration camp”—built on the ruins of Rafah near the enclave's southern edge. Under Katz's proposal, over two million Palestinians would be held in an area a third the size of Washington, D.C., until they can be resettled abroad.

“We are destroying more and more homes, and they have nowhere to return to,” Netanyahu said of Gaza's population in May. “The only inevitable outcome will be the desire of Gazans to emigrate outside of the Gaza Strip.” So even if he were to agree to a short-term cease-fire, addressing Palestinians' right to self-determination cannot be part of any deal because he considers the notion of an independent Palestinian state to be a threat to Israel, as the Israeli prime minister stated during a visit to the White House on July 7.

But Netanyahu's formula to end conflict in the Middle East is not fit for purpose. No Arab government will entertain the forced displacement of Palestinians. Moreover, Arab states have made it increasingly clear that they are no longer willing to deepen their ties or normalize relations with Israel until Israel accepts a sovereign Palestinian state. France, meanwhile, has announced that it will recognize the state of Palestine. The British government is under growing domestic pressure to go beyond the sanctions it has imposed on specific Israeli cabinet ministers and approve a full embargo on arms exports to Israel and support the International Criminal Court's prosecutions of Netanyahu and the former Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes, including for the deliberate starvation of Gaza's population.

If left unchecked, Netanyahu may soon succeed in forcing a mass displacement of Palestinians, preventing Trump from properly recalibrating the United States' Middle East policy and from reducing the U.S. military footprint in the region. The blunt truth is that Netanyahu is one of a small handful of regional actors whose interests do not broadly align with Trump's. And Trump has more room to maneuver than any other recent American president. He must deploy the full weight of U.S. power to force Netanyahu to end his territorial ambitions and accept a peace that enables recognition of an independent state of Palestine. That is the only way Trump can be a genuine peacemaker in the Middle East.

Netanyahu has been an obstacle to Trump's objectives in the Middle East since the U.S. president's first term in the White House. Back then, Trump hoped to make a grand Middle East peace deal his signature achievement. But by allowing Netanyahu to have a hand in drafting his 2020 plan for a comprehensive regional peace, Trump killed any chance he had for success. That plan sought to resolve all outstanding issues between Israel and the Palestinians in Israel's favor: there would be no Israeli military withdrawal from the West Bank, no evacuation of any Israeli settlements, and no right of return for Palestinian refugees, either to Israel or to the Palestinian territories. Predictably, Palestinians refused to accept their permanent subjugation under a regime that the International Court of Justice judged in 2024 to be equivalent to apartheid rule. Netanyahu's strategy allowed him to appear a peacemaker while denying Trump a true peace deal that addressed Palestinian rights head on and cleared the way for Israel's integration into the region.

Trump may not have fully appreciated the extent to which Netanyahu's political identity was founded on denying Palestinians' national identity. “Everyone knows that I am the one who, for decades, has blocked the establishment of a Palestinian state,” Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving prime minister, asserted last year. He was not being braggadocious; he spoke the truth. For over two decades, he has been instrumental in putting obstacles in front of any agreement that would further Palestinian self-determination.



Netanyahu is now better positioned than ever to not only prevent the creation of a Palestinian state but also annex the occupied Palestinian territories for Israeli settlement. Days after Hamas's October 2023 attack on Israel, the Israeli Ministry of Intelligence submitted a plan to Netanyahu—versions of which had been in circulation since 2018—recommending the depopulation of Gaza under the guise of “humanitarian voluntary evacuation.” The Israeli government went on to prosecute a military campaign that destroyed most of the enclave and its agricultural land; what buildings still stand are being methodically leveled in controlled bombings.

Netanyahu has repeatedly claimed that killing Palestinians—the toll stands at more than 59,000 Palestinians—and rendering Gaza unlivable was necessary to destroy Hamas. His critics often counter that he has prolonged the war in Gaza to keep himself in office as he battles corruption charges in court. But his underlying goals are bigger, and if not for the ongoing trial, Netanyahu would likely be pursuing the same policies in Gaza. His government has established a bureau to find willing third countries to take Palestinians from Gaza. And in the West Bank—where there is no Hamas enemy to point to—the Israel Defense Forces launched the so-called Operation Iron Wall mission in January to, as Katz, the Israeli defense minister, explicitly put it, apply the lessons of what the military accomplished in Gaza. More than 40,000 Palestinians were forced from their homes, the greatest displacement in the area since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Essential infrastructure and symbols of Palestinian national identity were destroyed, and streets were widened to make way for future Israeli tanks. Netanyahu also seized control of the Palestinian land registry in the West Bank to expedite the transfer of Palestinian private land to Israeli settlers.

Netanyahu has no intention of deviating from the platform of his Likud party, which states that “between the Sea and the Jordan there will be only Israeli sovereignty.” As he stated in December 2022, his government's guiding principles are that “Jewish people have an exclusive and indisputable right” to settle in the entirety of “Judea and Samaria,” encompassing all the West Bank. Under Netanyahu's leadership, Zionist parties to the left of Likud have shifted toward his position. In July 2024, the Israeli parliament overwhelmingly approved a bill opposing the establishment of any Palestinian state that included territory west of the Jordan River; last week, an even larger parliamentary majority called for annexing the West Bank.

If October 7, 2023, and its aftermath established anything for key Arab states, however, it is that the need for regional peace and security is urgent—and that peace between Israel and the Palestinians is indivisible from this aim. The lack of a resolution has become a national-security noose around the neck of every state in the Middle East—whether because of the spillover of fighting since October 7, the threat of refugee flows across borders, or the impact of persistent regional turmoil on states' ability to act on essential national development goals. Even if some appetite still exists among Arab leaders to deepen relations with Israel, they are now constrained by the fact that their populations' opinions of Israel are overwhelmingly negative, as Michael Robbins and Amaney Jamal wrote in Foreign Affairs in January.

Saudi Arabia's de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has been clear: after what he referred to as Israel's “collective genocide” in Gaza, his country can accept only a normalization process that resembles the one proposed by the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, adopted at an Arab League summit: Israel must first accept a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, and only then will Saudi Arabia normalize relations. In early July, the crown prince's foreign minister, Faisal bin Farhan, reiterated that position, saying that a cease-fire in Gaza must be “a prelude to the establishment of a Palestinian state.” And despite statements in June by Trump administration officials that Lebanon and Syria might be on the cusp of embracing Israel as a neighbor, the Israeli air attacks that have pounded eastern Lebanon and the heart of Damascus this month make that unlikely.

Significant elements of Trump's domestic base, meanwhile, want him to prioritize American interests, which they believe diverge from Netanyahu's vision for the Middle East. Figures such as Tucker Carlson question the unconditional financial, military, and diplomatic support the U.S. government gives to Israel. Others go further: in June, for instance, the influential podcaster Theo Von called out Israel's “genocide” of Palestinians during an interview with Vice President JD Vance. These MAGA influencers are not outliers; they are reflective of broader changes in the Republican Party and the country. A March survey by the Pew Research Center found that 37 percent of Republicans overall and half of Republicans under 50 now hold an unfavorable view of Israel. And according to a poll released in May by Ipsos and the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, over 60 percent of Americans now agree that Israel is playing a negative role in “resolving key challenges in the Middle East.”

This offers Trump some freedom to break from Washington's decades-long approach mandating that there be “no daylight” between Israeli and U.S. policy in the Middle East. The president should listen to his public and shift the U.S. government's relationship with Israel so it better reflects Americans' preferences, as well as the desires of most U.S. partners in the Middle East. That means preventing Netanyahu from thwarting a permanent cease-fire; accepting that it is impossible, in the near term, to eliminate Hamas from Palestinian society; helping strengthen Palestinian institutions; and putting Palestinian statehood at the center of any regional agreement. Any peace deal that Trump proposes or backs will have to look very different than the one he put forward in 2020, when Netanyahu stood beside him at the White House without a Palestinian counterpart.

Trump should aim for a deal that draws support from a wide variety of stakeholders in the Middle East, throughout the Muslim world, and in Europe. He will need many governments in those regions on his side to help provide the many billions of dollars necessary to fund Gaza's reconstruction. The essential elements of a cease-fire deal that could lay the foundation for a more comprehensive regional peace already exist in two documents: the so-called 2024 Beijing Declaration (which the major Palestinian political factions, including Fatah and Hamas, signed last year) and the Arab League's Plan for the Early Recovery, Reconstruction, and Development of Gaza, backed by the 57-member Organization of Islamic Cooperation and by France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom. According to Jeremy Scahill's reporting at Drop Site News, Hamas negotiators have offered Israel an “all for all” formula as long as the United States guarantees that Israel will not resume its attacks after Israeli hostages are freed.

To take advantage of this opportunity, Trump must be willing to hold Israel to a commitment not to restart hostilities anywhere in the occupied Palestinian territories. Then he would have to secure an agreement from Israel to allow international peacekeeping forces into Gaza, and eventually the West Bank, as a broader political accord is negotiated. Egyptian and EU forces were successfully deployed during the short-lived cease-fire that began in January, and they should be called on again. Their presence could allow signatories to implement the Beijing Declaration, in which Hamas agreed to hand over governance and security control in Gaza to the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority and Fatah agreed to hold elections and begin a process to integrate Hamas into the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).

Successful solutions to other once intractable conflicts, such as the decades of sectarian and civil strife in Northern Ireland, show that enduring peace is possible only when all stakeholders are invited in. And Hamas is hardly the only entity that seeks the outcome delineated in the Beijing Declaration. A March poll conducted by the Institute for Social and Economic Progress, a think tank based in the West Bank city of Ramallah, found that more than 60 percent of Palestinians in Gaza supported a unity government for postwar rule and that over half said they would also support rule by the Palestinian Authority.

Only when Gaza and the West Bank come under one authority can the enormous task of healing and rebuilding in Gaza begin. And only a unified and legitimate Palestinian leadership can guarantee that the terms of any future political agreement with Israel will be upheld. Ultimately, to broker a real peace between Israelis and Palestinians, Trump will need the PLO, the internationally recognized interlocutor possessing the legal capacity to sign an agreement on behalf of all Palestinians. And by supporting the inclusion of Hamas under the organization's umbrella, he would mitigate the potential for spoilers.

Achieving all this would likely have been too tall an order for most U.S. presidents over the past three decades. But the war in Gaza has cost the United States an extraordinary amount. According to estimates from the Watson School of International and Public Affairs at Brown University, the United States provided Israel with at least $22.7 billion during the war's first 12 months. That was far above the annual cap of $3.8 billion mandated in a ten-year memorandum of understanding between the United States and Israel that extends until 2028. On top of this monetary assistance, the U.S. government has been roped into a game of international whack-a-mole on Israel's behalf to prevent countries such as France and the United Kingdom from imposing sanctions on Israel or recognizing a Palestinian state.

Rather than expend such resources and political energy to win Israel's forever war in Gaza—one that the United States' Arab partners oppose—the Trump administration must recalibrate U.S. policy toward winning the peace. Trump has been uniquely willing to break with Israel on many issues—for instance, by making deals with the Houthi militant group in Yemen and opening a diplomatic dialogue with Syria's new leader, Ahmed al-Shara, despite his past alignment with al-Qaeda. Trump will have to break with Netanyahu again, regardless of the implications for the Israeli leader's political future. He should walk back his previous statement supporting the resettlement of Palestinians from Gaza and make the case directly to Israelis that their security is tied to the security of Palestinians and the rest of the region. With a recent Pew poll indicating that more than 80 percent of Jewish Israelis have confidence in Trump as a world leader, he can credibly argue that opposing Palestinian self-determination will undermine Israeli security and preclude normalization with Arab states and Israel's regional integration.

When it comes to Israel and the Palestinians, Trump's administration has already shown flexibility by breaking with Washington orthodoxy to open channels of communication with Hamas to secure the release of an American held in Gaza. Now, putting American interests first requires brokering an immediate and permanent cease-fire in Gaza. If Trump goes further, he might have a peace-prize-worthy achievement—but not if Gaza starves.

            Goodwill, Easterseals and other nonprofit organizations say thousands of low-income seniors could soon be unemployed because funding hasn't come through for a decades-old federal job training and placement program.
    


            The Department of Labor has yet to release more than $300 million in funds for national grantees of the Senior Community Service Employment Program, which was created in 1965 to help low-income, out-of-work adults 55 and older — especially veterans, rural residents and people with disabilities — return to the workforce.
    


            On July 1, the Department of Labor released about $86 million in funds to state recipients, but the national grantees' funds were not released (something that's typically done in May), several of the longtime participating nonprofit organizations told CNN. The funding pause of the program that serves about 40,000 seniors was first reported by Bloomberg Law.
    


            As a result, those organizations say they've had to furlough seniors participating in the program, as well as their own employees. These moves are coming at a time when hiring activity has continued to slow in the broader US labor market.
    


            “This is an intrinsically American program, when you think about it: people who want to work, who want to be contributing members of society, people who want to be able to support themselves, who want to be a part of a community,” Kendra Davenport, president and chief executive officer of Easterseals, which provides services to children and adults with disabilities.
    


            But the uncertainty extends beyond the current year's funding, as the program itself is feared to be on borrowed time: The proposed 2026 fiscal year budget for the Labor Department proposes eliminating the SCSEP and a slew of other longtime job training programs and replacing them with a block grant to be distributed to states and local communities.
    


            Such potential cuts couldn't be coming at a worse time, Davenport said.
    


            “If you look at a macro level at what is impacting these seniors, there are Medicaid cuts, so their health care might go away,” she said. “There are massive [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] cuts. Many of these folks are dependent on SNAP for food assistance; that's going away. And now SCSEP is taking away their opportunity to work.”
    


            She added: “We're putting people who really do want to help themselves in a terrible position.”
    


Trump wants more skilled tradespeople. His Labor Department is trying to cut off a pipeline of workers



            A Labor Department spokeswoman said the agency will “provide an update soon” on the remaining $307 million in 2025 funding for the national grant recipients.
    


            “The Department has given all SCSEP grantees a one-month period of performance extension, so that if grantees have funding available from their Program Year 2024 grant, they can still use these funds to continue program operations,” Christine Feroli, a Labor Department spokeswoman, wrote via email to CNN. “The Employment and Training Administration is preparing to award grants shortly after state and territorial grantees submit their required budget documents. The department will support grantees in their operations and services to participants.”
    


            Organizations such as the National Asian Center on Aging are sounding the alarm over the funding delays.
    


            “This funding delay is not just a bureaucratic issue, it's a crisis for tens of thousands of older adults who depend on SCSEP to survive,” Clayton Fong, president and CEO of the organization that provides employment programs and caregiving services for older adults, said in a statement earlier this month.
    


            In an emailed statement to CNN, Fong called on the Labor Department to fully fund the program to support a “meaningful pathway to economic stability” for low-income seniors.
    


            “SCSEP is a job training program that restores dignity and a sense of purpose to seniors who want to continue working but are often overlooked in the workforce,” Fong said. “This funding pause has painful consequences for jobseekers who are trying to build skills and take care of themselves and their families.”
    


            Fong's organization has furloughed more than 800 senior workers.
    


            At Goodwill Industries, more than 400 program participants were placed on leave of absence status; and if funds are not released by July 31, additional furloughs could impact more than 1,500 of its older workers, the nonprofit said in an emailed statement to CNN.
    


            “Goodwill is urging the Department of Labor to quickly provide the allocations needed for this important program to continue and calls upon Congress to continue to invest in SCSEP, providing essential support for older workers,” according to the statement.

            Ever since Chief Justice John Roberts swore in Donald Trump at the US Capitol January 20 – with the eight other Supreme Court justices looking on – the question has been whether they would restrain a president who vowed to upend the constitutional order.
    


            The answer, a half-year later, is no.
    


            That was underscored this month by the court's decisions allowing Trump to fire another set of independent regulators, to dismantle the Department of Education and to deport migrants to dangerous countries where they have no citizenship or connection.
    


            Meanwhile, the fissures among the nine have deepened. They have condemned each other in written opinions and revealed the personal strains in public appearances.
    


            The conservative majority that controls the court has repeatedly undercut the US district court judges on the front lines who've held hearings, discerned the facts, and issued orders to check Trump actions.
    


            In the most significant case so far related to Trump's second term, touching on birthright citizenship, Justice Amy Coney Barrett pointedly addressed the role of lower court judges, saying they have a limited ability to block arguably unconstitutional moves.
    


            “(F)ederal courts do not exercise general oversight of the Executive Branch; they resolve cases and controversies consistent with the authority Congress has given them,” Barrett wrote for the conservative majority as it reversed a series of lower court decisions. “When a court concludes that the Executive Branch has acted unlawfully, the answer is not for the court to exceed its power, too.”
    


            Dissenting in that late June case, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said the majority had essentially “shoved lower court judges out of the way.”
    


            More recently, last Wednesday, the conservative majority overrode US district and appellate court judges to let Trump fire Biden-appointed members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission who'd been confirmed by the Senate and were still serving their terms. To justify the action, the conservative majority referred to an earlier action in May letting Trump remove members of two independent entities that protect private employees and federal workers, respectively, the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board.
    


            Neither in the earlier case nor the new one centered on the commission that shields consumers from hazardous products did the majority acknowledge that a 1935 precedent, Humphrey's Executor v. United States, had protected such independent board members from being fired without legitimate reason such as misconduct. As lower court judges have noted, the justices have never reversed Humphrey's Executor, leaving it as a precedent that judges – at least those below the nine justices – must follow.
    


            Without formally taking up the issue, calling for briefing and holding arguments, the high court is nonetheless signaling a new course – obliquely.
    


            “Although our interim orders are not conclusive as to the merits, they inform how a court should exercise its equitable discretion in like cases,” the Supreme Court said in its unsigned order on July 23. “The stay we issued in (the May case) reflected ‘our judgment that the Government faces greater risk of harm from an order allowing a removed officer to continue exercising the executive power than a wrongfully removed officer faces from being unable to perform her statutory duty.'”
    


            The message: They did it before, they can do it again.
    


            Referring to the consequences, dissenting Justice Elena Kagan wrote, “By means of such actions, this Court may facilitate the permanent transfer of authority, piece by piece by piece, from one branch of Government to another.”
    


            The high court similarly brushed aside lower court determinations when it ruled on July 14 against states and labor unions that had sued the Department of Education for its actions to dissolve the agency.
    


            The majority declined to offer any hint of its rationale.
    


            However, the dissenting liberal justices in a 19-page opinion picked up lower court judges' emphasis on the history of the agency created by Congress nearly a half-century ago: “(T)he Department plays a vital role in this Nation's education system, safeguarding equal access to learning and channeling billions of dollars to schools and students across the country each year. Only Congress has the power to abolish the Department.”
    


            Referring to Education Secretary Linda McMahon's directives removing half the staff and aiming for an eventual shutdown of the department, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justices Kagan and Jackson, added, “When the Executive publicly announces its intent to break the law, and then executes on that promise, it is the Judiciary's duty to check that lawlessness, not expedite it.”
    


            The six Republican-appointed conservatives have expressed no dread, offered no warnings that Trump's actions might ever go too far, unlike the Democratic-appointed liberal dissenters. The conservatives, in fact, took pains to avoid any disapproval of Trump's plan to end birthright citizenship – that is, the constitutional guarantee that children born in the US become citizens even if their parents are not – as they clipped lower courts' power to impose nationwide injunctions.
    


            That June 27 decision's effect on his proposed lifting of birthright citizenship is still working its way through lower courts.
    


            Sotomayor and Jackson have routinely protested in provocative terms. When Sotomayor dissented in a high-profile deportation case earlier this month, she warned that migrants flown out of the US to South Sudan could face torture or death.
    


            The two liberals have also referred to the personal costs. Sotomayor said in a May speech that she sometimes returns to her office after a decision is issued, closes her door and weeps. Jackson, who seems most isolated from the rest of the justices, told an audience earlier this month she is kept up at night by “the state of our democracy.”



            The conservatives who dominate have directed any angst or anger not toward the executive branch but toward their judicial colleagues.
    


            In the birthright citizenship case, Barrett (in the majority) and Jackson (dissenting) traded insults that suggested a lack of mutual respect.
    


            “We will not dwell on Justice Jackson's argument,” Barrett wrote, even as she criticized her for choosing “a startling line of attack that is tethered neither to these sources nor, frankly, to any doctrine whatsoever. … Rhetoric aside, Justice Jackson's position is difficult to pin down.”
    


            Jackson wrote that the Barrett majority had reduced the case to “a mind-numbingly technical query.” And Jackson, writing alone, asserted, “the majority sees a power grab—but not by a presumably lawless Executive choosing to act in a manner that flouts the plain text of the Constitution. Instead, to the majority, the power-hungry actors are … (wait for it) … the district courts.”
    


            Roberts signed onto all of Barrett's opinion in that late June case. If he and fellow conservatives engage in any special regard or deference, it's not for their lower court colleagues or the liberals with whom they sit. It's for Donald Trump.

            Democrats landed the biggest recruiting win of the 2026 midterm elections to date when former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper launched his Senate run Monday, boosting party hopes of winning the seat opened by retiring Republican Sen. Thom Tillis.
    


            They are looking for several more wins just like it to have a chance of flipping four Republican-held seats and going after a goal that seemed far out of reach earlier this cycle: taking the Senate majority next fall.
    


            The Senate recruiting landscape has been a mixed bag for both parties with uncertainty over President Donald Trump's popularity, the role he'll play in Republican primaries, and questions about the political futures of several high-profile figures — both incumbents and potential candidates — hanging over the early stages of the election cycle.
    


            Democrats hope they can run strong candidates in Maine and GOP-friendly states like Iowa and Texas. They also have to defend seats in four potentially competitive states: Georgia, where Sen. Jon Ossoff is up for reelection, and Michigan, Minnesota and New Hampshire, where the party's incumbents are all retiring.
    


            In New Hampshire, Rep. Chris Pappas, another top Democratic recruit, is running for Senate, while on the Republican side, former Gov. Chris Sununu passed on the race. In Georgia, popular Republican Gov. Brian Kemp passed on a Senate race in a break for Ossoff. And in Maine, Democrats are hoping Gov. Janet Mills will challenge longtime Republican Sen. Susan Collins.
    


            But Democrats are trying to resolve conflicts in other races on the board and prevent  drawn-out primaries that could hurt their chances next November.
    


            “Governor Cooper is a formidable candidate who will flip North Carolina's Senate seat, and his announcement is the latest indication that the Republicans' Senate majority is at risk in 2026,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and his Senate campaign chief, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, said in a statement to CNN.
    


            Michigan's open Senate race is the one that most worries national Democrats, according to half a dozen lawmakers, senior aides and strategists.
    


            Republicans are largely uniting behind former Rep. Mike Rogers, the party's losing nominee in the 2024 Senate race. Rogers got a boost in recent days when Rep. Bill Huizenga passed on a Senate run, a decision that followed a push from Trump and other Republicans to defend a potentially competitive House seat in western Michigan, a source familiar with the matter said.
    


            Rogers' supporters argue that he now has advantages that he didn't when he lost last year to then-Rep. Elissa Slotkin, including a primary field free of other major contenders and stronger early fundraising.
    


            Democrats are facing a competitive primary that includes three well-known contenders: Rep. Haley Stevens, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow and progressive former gubernatorial candidate Abdul El-Sayed.
    


            Several of the Democratic sources CNN spoke to said Schumer and his team have privately signaled they believe Stevens is the strongest general election candidate. In another nod to Stevens' Democratic establishment support, she earned an endorsement from former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi earlier this summer. And two people involved in Michigan politics said Gillibrand has privately encouraged donors to support Stevens.
    


            A spokesperson for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee declined to comment on Gillibrand's behalf, but offered an upbeat statement that Democrats would hold the seat next November.
    


            “Republicans have not won a Senate race in Michigan in 30 years — and 2026 will be no different with failed candidate Mike Rogers on the ballot,” spokesperson Maeve Coyle said in a statement.
    


            Democrats there have also been surprised by the strong fundraising power of El-Sayed — backed by independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders — who has been urging his party to take a more aggressive stance on Trump.
    


            Democrats in the state are still hoping they can unite behind a candidate before next August's primary. But there have been some hurdles, including interpersonal disputes between Slotkin and other major players in the state, including Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
    


            They also fear that the state's race for governor won't help either: Mike Duggan, the popular Detroit mayor, has decided to run as an independent, potentially splintering the Democratic base and raising questions about what that could mean for Michigan's Senate and House races.
    


            “I don't think people understand how dysfunctional the Senate race is,” one Michigan Democrat told CNN of the bruising three-way primary. “If we don't pull people together, we are screwed.”
    


            Texas is a red state, but Republicans face an increasingly bitter primary battle between Sen. John Cornyn and his conservative challenger, MAGA-aligned state Attorney General Ken Paxton — one that intensified with the news that Paxton's wife, state Sen. Angela Paxton, had filed for divorce. National Republicans believe that Cornyn is in trouble, and pro-Cornyn groups are already spending heavily this summer in a bid to demonstrate he can keep pace with Paxton in polls.
    


            A third potential candidate, Rep. Wesley Hunt, has not ruled out a bid and has been spending small sums on advertising, with more expected in the coming weeks. Another Republican often mentioned as a possible contender, Rep. Ronny Jackson, is one of Trump's closest allies in Texas. But two people familiar with discussions about Jackson's future said he is expected to remain in the House and one said he is interested in a Trump administration role in the future.
    


            Democrats believe Paxton would be a weaker general election candidate if he wins the Republican primary. But they could face a messy primary of their own.
    


            Former Rep. Colin Allred, the party's losing nominee in the 2024 Senate race, has already launched his campaign, with his supporters pointing to how he outran Kamala Harris in key parts of the state last November. Beto O'Rourke, who lost the 2018 Senate race and the 2022 governor's race, is also considering a run and is hitting the road like a candidate. He held 16 town halls across the state in May, June and July, including 12 in Republican-held congressional districts. And other Democrats are also considering Senate runs.
    


            Some officials and donors have sought to steer potential Senate candidates into other races, urging state Rep. James Talarico to run for governor and US Rep. Joaquin Castro to run for attorney general, three people familiar with the matter said. However, it's not clear that Talarico or Castro are moving toward those races themselves.
    


            Talarico told CNN last week he is “certainly thinking about” running for higher office, and will make decisions about his political future after Texas' special legislative session, which began last week and can last no more than 30 days.
    


            “Once that's over, I am going to look at how I can best serve, and that includes the US Senate,” Talarico said. “I'm not taking anything off the table right now.”
    


            Castro and his office did not respond to CNN's request for comment. He testified in a Texas legislative hearing last week, opposing a GOP push during the special session to redraw the state's congressional lines. Castro told state lawmakers they are “being used by the White House and Donald Trump.”
    


            O'Rourke's political action committee has hosted events with many of the Texas Democrats weighing statewide runs. Talarico, Castro, Rep. Jasmine Crockett and others spoke at a rally Friday in Austin. In late June, O'Rourke, Talarico and Castro all participated in a similar town hall in San Antonio hosted by O'Rourke's group.
    


            Uncertainty looms over two other states Democrats hope to target: Ohio and Iowa.
    


            The party's hopes of defeating Ohio Republican Sen. Jon Husted — who was appointed by Gov. Mike DeWine in January to fill the seat formerly held by Vice President JD Vance — largely depend on whether former Sen. Sherrod Brown, who lost his reelection bid in 2024, attempts a comeback.
    


            Iowa is also a question mark, with operatives buzzing for months over rumors that Republican Sen. Joni Ernst — who faced backlash after dismissing concerns about Medicaid funding cuts by telling a crowd that “we are all going to die” — could retire.
    


            “There's always all kinds of chitter-chatter everywhere, but I have a lot left to do in the United States Senate, so I am not slowing down any time soon. We'll have an announcement this fall,” Ernst told Radio Iowa this month.
    


            However, Republicans have a deep bench in the red state. Many within the party believe Rep. Ashley Hinson would be the favorite in a primary to replace Ernst.
    


            The still-growing Democratic field in Iowa already includes state Rep. J.D. Scholten, state Sen. Zach Wahls and Knoxville Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Nathan Sage.
    


            Another likely long shot for Democrats is Alaska, where Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan is up for reelection. Democrats are waiting for a decision from former Rep. Mary Peltola, who lost her House seat to GOP Rep. Nick Begich last year but is viewed as perhaps the only Democrat who could turn that Senate race into a competitive one.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Fleeing his hometown following Russia's invasion, this Ukrainian swimmer never thought he'd become a world champion","https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/29/sport/vladyslav-bukhov-ukraine-world-aquatics-championships-intl","Tue, 29 Jul 2025 07:12:00 GMT","


            Ukrainian swimmer Vladyslav Bukhov knows better than anyone just how fine the margins in his sport can be.
    


            At just 21 years of age, the sprint swimmer claimed gold in the 50m freestyle at the 2024 World Aquatics Championships in Doha by a mere 0.01 seconds – literally less than the blink of an eye.
    


            That title etched Bukhov into Ukraine's sporting history, making him the country's third-ever long-course (competitions held in a 50m pool) world champion.
    


            At the time, Bukhov was a relatively unknown figure in elite swimming, with only a few thousand social media followers.
    


            However, he left Qatar having completed one of the world championships' greatest-ever shocks, edging out the previous two champions, Cameron McEvoy and Ben Proud, in the final.
    


            Ostensibly emerging out of the blue, Bukhov's journey – like most gold medalists – started long before the pageantry of international swim meets and media spotlight.
    


            Speaking to CNN Sports ahead of the swimming portion of the 2025 World Aquatics Championships in Singapore, the 22-year-old offered a frank insight into his ascent to the top of the sport.
    


            “People will look and see that I'm world champion. But what they don't see is how long the road and the journey is to that medal and podium,” Bukhov said.
    


            “I have been swimming since the age of seven. That means I was swimming for 14 years – well over half my life – before I won gold in Doha.
    


            “There have been a lot of sacrifices along the way to get me to where I am today.”
    


            Bukhov's unlikely success becomes more impressive once learning that despite starting the sport at age seven, he didn't swim in a competitive race until he was 15 years old in 2018.
    


            When asked why it took him so long to transition into competitive swimming, Bukhov explained that his introduction to the sport was never based around “dreams of medals or fame.”
    


            “I tried all the sports growing up. Swimming didn't become my main focus until I was a teenager,” he recalled.
    


            “At first, I got into it because I loved the modern pentathlon. So, in the beginning, I saw it as just a small part of my sporting life.
    


            “But as I got older, it became clear that I had a talent for swimming. That's when my parents stepped in and said they would take me to a proper coach.”
    


            Like all Ukrainians, Bukhov's life has been deeply affected by Russia's aggression toward his homeland.
    


            Back in 2014, before the current full-scale war in Ukraine, Russian paramilitaries seized control of Bukhov's hometown of Donetsk in the country's eastern Donbas region.
    


            Only 11 years old at the time, Bukhov and his family were forced to leave their home and travel 10 hours west to the relative safety of Kyiv.
    


            “It was a very scary time for us all,” the swimmer said. “I was quite young at the time, so I didn't fully understand what was going on.
    


After war threatened to derail their preparation, these twins went on an Olympic ‘mission' to serve Ukraine



            “My main memory is just the sadness of needing to leave where I was from and move to somewhere completely new.”
    


            After nearly eight years in the nation's capital, the pain of fleeing Donetsk had started to feel like a distant memory for Bukhov.
    


            Those memories came flooding back for him and his family, though, in late February 2022, when Russian forces crossed Ukraine's eastern border and encircled Kyiv just a few days later.
    


            “I thought we had left all the fighting behind us. When I woke up that morning and heard the news that Kyiv had been surrounded, I struggled to believe my family and I had found ourselves in the same situation all over again.”
    


            More than three years later, life for most Ukrainians has yet to return to normal.
    


            For elite athletes like Bukhov – who rely on routine and stability – training and preparation have had to be heavily adapted.
    


            “It is impossible to train normally. We can't even do simple everyday things, let alone all the stuff that professional athletes have to do,” Bukhov said.
    


            “Air raid sirens constantly interrupt our lives – whether we're in the pool, in the gym, or just trying to sleep at night. We can't do anything without this constant fear.”
    


            In recent months, Bukhov says the drone and missile attacks on Kyiv seem to be increasing in frequency.
    


            “Russia has been bombing us nearly every night. Just the other week, a missile struck a nearby area in Kyiv and over 30 people died.
    


            “It does scare you, of course, because each night when you go to bed, you don't know if you'll live or die – if you'll wake up the next morning. Each day has become a lottery.”
    


            He adds that there have been many occasions where he and his teammates were mid-session in the pool when the screech of air raid sirens forced them to rush to shelters still wrapped in towels.
    


            “You never know how much time you'll have in the pool before you need to get out, so it's just a case of doing as much as you can while you can,” Bukhov said.
    


            There is always pride in representing your nation on the international stage, but for Ukrainian athletes like Bukhov, that pride has grown even deeper as the war rumbles on.
    


            “As an athlete, I feel even prouder now. I am competing for more than just my own glory,” the 22-year-old said.
    


            Even before the war, when competing at youth level, Bukhov says he always gave everything to see the Ukrainian flag hoisted above the podium.

            Now, though, he feels he has found another level of passion and purpose in competing for his country.
    


            “When I travel abroad to competitions, I'm one of the lucky few who gets to temporarily leave the war. … Normal people don't get a break from the bombing and the sirens, so I try to do my part in my own way.
    


            “I tell myself that if I swim fast and continue to break records, people back home will get a small distraction from reality and feel pride that Ukraine is still succeeding despite everything.
    


            “During war, there's no option but to keep going and try to live as normally as we can. For some, that means going to university or an office. For me, that's swimming faster.
    


            “If everyone does their job in Ukraine – no matter how small – it can make a big difference collectively. That's what I keep telling myself.”
    


            Heading into the swimming portion of the World Aquatics Championships, Bukhov is aiming to return to his best form – something that eluded him at last summer's Olympic Games in Paris.
    


            Having been crowned world champion just a few months before the Games, the Ukrainian struggled to follow up on that breakthrough performance, placing 11th overall in the 50-meter freestyle.
    


            On the wrong side of swimming's razor-thin margins, Bukhov missed out on the Olympic final by just 0.13 seconds.
    


            It was not a new pain for the swimmer either, having placed in the exact same position – one spot outside the finals – in the 2021 Tokyo Games.
    


            But he has used these disappointments to fuel his motivation to defend his world title.
    


            “At the Olympics, I was very disappointed. I was a little bit sick and wasn't able to perform my best or live up to my own standards,” he told CNN Sports. “I'm heading to Kallang with one goal: to swim faster than I ever have before.
    


            “Let's see where that leaves me on the podium. But in my mind, when I'm up on the starting block, my only thought will be about chasing a new PB and breaking my national record.”
    


            The journey itself to Singapore is another reminder of the often-overlooked consequences of war.
    


            With Ukraine's airspace closed, Bukhov will take a nine-hour train west to the Polish border before crossing into the town of Chełm.
    


            From there, he'll take a further three-hour train ride to Warsaw, where he and his teammates will finally board a flight to Singapore.
    


            In total, they will spend more time traveling to the airport from Kyiv than they will in the air en route to Southeast Asia.
    


            “It's not ideal, but we're used to it now,” Bukhov said. “The journey will be long, so I have to make sure I make it worthwhile.”

MONTREAL (AP) — Throughout his new term, starting with his inaugural address, President Donald Trump has said he was “saved by God” to make America great again. In Canada, Prime Minister Mark Carney rarely evokes religion in public; his victory speech in April never used the word God. “Canada forever. Vive le Canada,” he ended.

As Canada and the U.S. now skirmish over Trump's tariff threats and occasional bullying, the leaders' rhetoric reflects a striking difference between their nations. Religion plays a far more subdued role in the public sphere in Canada than in its southern neighbor.

Trump posed in front of a vandalized Episcopal parish house gripping a Bible. He invites pastors to the Oval Office to pray with him. His ally, House Speaker Mike Johnson, says the best way to understand his own world view is to read the Bible.

Such high-level religion-themed displays would be unlikely and almost certainly unpopular in Canada, where Carney — like his recent predecessors — generally avoids public discussion of his faith. (He is a Catholic who supports abortion rights.)

There are broader differences as well. The rate of regular church attendance in Canada is far lower than in the U.S. Evangelical Christians have nowhere near the political clout in Canada that they have south of the border. There is no major campaign in Canada to post the Ten Commandments in public schools or to enact sweeping abortion bans.

Kevin Kee, a professor and former dean at the University of Ottawa, has written about the contrasting religious landscapes of the U.S. and Canada, exploring the rise of American evangelist Billy Graham to become a confidant of numerous U.S. presidents.




Christianity, Kee said, has not permeated modern Canadian politics to that extent.

“We have a political leadership that keeps its religion quiet,” Kee said. “To make that kind of declaration in Canada is to create an us/them situation. There's no easy way to keep everybody happy, so people keep it quiet.”

The mostly French-speaking province of Quebec provides a distinctive example of Canada's tilt toward secularism. The Catholic Church was Quebec's dominant force through most of its history, with sweeping influence over schools, health care and politics.

That changed dramatically in the so-called Quiet Revolution of the 1960s, when the provincial government took control of education and health care as part of a broader campaign to reduce the church's power. The rate of regular church attendance among Quebec's Catholics plummeted from one of the highest in Canada to the one of the lowest.

Among religiously devout Canadians, in Quebec and other provinces, some are candid about feeling marginalized in a largely secular country.

“I feel isolated because our traditional Christian views are seen as old-fashioned or not moving with the times,” said Mégane Arès-Dubé, 22, after she and her husband attended a service at a conservative Reformed Baptist church in Saint Jerome, about 30 miles (nearly 50 kilometers) north of Montreal.

“Contrary to the U.S., where Christians are more represented in elected officials, Christians are really not represented in Canada,” she added. “I pray that Canada wakes up.”

The church's senior pastor, Pascal Denault, has mixed feelings about the Quiet Revolution's legacy.

“For many aspects of it, that was good,” he said. “Before that, it was mainly the Catholic clergy that controlled many things in the province, so we didn't have religious freedom.”

Nonetheless, Denault wishes for a more positive public view of religion in Canada.

“Sometimes, secularism becomes a religion in itself, and it wants to shut up any religious speech in the public sphere,” he said. “What we hope for is that the government will recognize that religion is not an enemy to fight, but it's more a positive force to encourage.”

Denault recently hosted a podcast episode focusing on Trump; he later shared some thoughts about the president.

“We tend to think that Trump is more using Christianity as a tool for his influence, rather than being a genuine Christian,” he said. “But Christians are, I think, appreciative of some of his stances on different things.”

Trump's religion-related tactics — such as posing with the Bible in his hands — wouldn't go over well with Canadians, Denault said.

“They'd see that as something wrongful. The public servant should not identify with a specific religion,” Denault said. “I don't think most Canadians would vote for that type of politician.”

In the Montreal neighborhood of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, the skyline is dotted with crosses atop steeples, but many of those churches are unused or repurposed. 

For decades, factory and port workers worshipped at Saint-Mathias-Apotre Church. Today it's a restaurant that serves affordable meals daily for more than 600 residents.

The manager of Le Chic Resto Pop, Marc-Andre Simard, grew up Catholic and now, like many of his staff, identifies as religiously unaffiliated. But he still tries to honor some core values of Catholicism at the nonprofit restaurant, which retains the church's original wooden doors and even its confessional booths. 

“There's still space to be together, to have some sort of communion, but it's around food, not around faith.” Simard said during a lunch break, sitting near what used to be the altar of the former church.

Simard says the extent to which the Catholic Church controlled so much of public life in Quebec should serve as a cautionary tale for the U.S.

“We went through what the United States are going through right now,” he said. 

Elsewhere in Montreal, a building that once housed a Catholic convent now often accommodates meetings of the Quebec Humanist Association.

The group's co-founder, Michel Virard, said French Canadians “know firsthand what it was to have a clergy nosing in their affairs.” 

Now, Virard says, “There is no ‘excluding religious voice' in Canada, merely attempts at excluding clergy from manipulating the state power levers and using taxpayers' money to promote a particular religious viewpoint.”

Why are Canada and the U.S., two neighbors which share so many cultural traditions and priorities, so different regarding religion's role in public life?

According to academics who have pondered that question, their history provides some answers. The United States, at independence from Britain, chose not to have a dominant, federally established church.

In Canada, meanwhile, the Catholic Church was dominant in Quebec, and the Church of England — eventually named the Anglican Church of Canada — was powerful elsewhere.

Professor Darren Dochuk, a Canadian who teaches history at University of Notre Dame in Indiana, says the “disestablishment” of religion in the U.S. “made religious life all the more dynamic.”

“This is a country in which free faith communities have been allowed to compete in the marketplace for their share,” he said.

“In the 20th century, you had a plethora of religious groups across the spectrum who all competed voraciously for access to power,” he said. “More recently, the evangelicals are really dominating that. … Religious conservatives are imposing their will on Washington.”

There's been no equivalent faith-based surge in Canada, said Dochuk, suggesting that Canada's secularization produced “precipitous decline in the power of religion as a major operator in politics.”

Carmen Celestini, professor of religious studies at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, said that even when Canadian politicians do opt for faith-based outreach, they often take a multicultural approach — for example, visiting Sikh, Hindu and Jewish houses of worship, as well as Christian churches.

Trump's talk about Canada becoming the 51st state fueled a greater sense of national unity among most Canadians, and undermined the relatively small portion of them who identify as Christian nationalists, Celestini said.

“Canada came together more as a nation, not sort of seeing differences with each other, but seeing each other as Canadians and being proud of our sovereignty and who we are as a nation,” she said. “The concern that Canadians have, when we look at what's happening in America, is that we don't want that to happen here. “

A man stalked through a Manhattan office tower firing a rifle Monday, killing four people, including a New York City police officer, and wounding a fifth before taking his own life, officials said.

NEW YORK (AP) — A gunman who killed four people at a Manhattan office building before killing himself claimed in a note to have a brain disease linked to contact sports and was trying to target the National Football League's headquarters but took the wrong elevator, officials said Tuesday. 

Investigators believe Shane Tamura, of Las Vegas, was trying to get up to the NFL offices after shooting several people in the lobby on Monday but entered the wrong elevator bank, Mayor Eric Adams said in interviews. 

Four people were killed, including an off-duty New York City police officer, Didarul Islam.

Tamura, who played high school football in California nearly two decades ago but never in the NFL, had a history of mental illness, police said. A three-page note found in his wallet suggested he had a grievance against the NFL over a claim that he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy. The degenerative brain disease has been linked to concussions and other repeated head trauma common in contact sports such as football, but it can only be diagnosed after someone has died.

In the note, Tamura repeatedly said he was sorry and asked that his brain be studied for CTE, according to the police department. The note also referenced former NFL player Terry Long, who was diagnosed with CTE, and the manner in which Long killed himself in 2005. The note accused the NFL of concealing the dangers to players' brains for profit.

The NFL long denied the link between football and CTE, but it acknowledged the connection in 2016 testimony before Congress and has paid more than $1.4 billion to retired players to settle concussion-related claims.




NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell called the shooting “an unspeakable act of violence in our building,” saying he was deeply grateful to the law enforcement officers who responded and the officer who gave his life to protect others.

Goodell said in a memo to staff that a league employee was seriously injured in the attack and was hospitalized in stable condition. 

The shooting happened along Park Avenue, one the nation's most recognized streets, and just blocks from Grand Central Terminal and Rockefeller Center. It's also less than a 15-minute walk from where UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was shot and killed last December by a man who prosecutors say was angry over corporate greed.

President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he knows that area of Manhattan well.

“I trust our Law Enforcement Agencies to get to the bottom of why this crazed lunatic committed such a senseless act of violence. My heart is with the families of the four people who were killed, including the NYPD Officer, who made the ultimate sacrifice,” Trump posted on social media.

Investigators found that Tamura drove across the country over the past few days and made his way into New York City just before the shooting, Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said.

Surveillance video showed the gunman exiting a double-parked BMW early Monday evening with a rifle, then marching across a plaza and into the skyscraper, which is also home to investment firm Blackstone and other companies. It was closed Tuesday except to investigators. 

He then sprayed the lobby with gunfire, killing Islam, who was off-police duty and working a corporate security detail, and hitting a woman who tried to take cover, Tisch said.

He next made his way to the elevator bank, shooting a guard at a security desk and another man in the lobby, the commissioner said.

“He appeared to have first walked past the officer and then he turned to his right, and saw him and discharged several rounds,” Adams said in a TV interview. 

Tamura took an elevator to the 33rd-floor offices of the company that owns the building, Rudin Management, and shot and killed one person on that floor. He then shot and killed himself, the commissioner said. 

Blackstone confirmed that one of its employees, real estate executive Wesley LePatner, was among those killed. Security officer Aland Etienne also died, according to a local labor union.

Islam, 36, had served as a police officer in New York City for 3½ years and was an immigrant from Bangladesh, Tisch said at a news conference.

His body was draped in the New York Police Department flag as it was moved from the hospital to an ambulance, with fellow officers standing at attention.

“He was doing the job that we asked him to do. He put himself in harm's way. He made the ultimate sacrifice,” Tisch said. “He died as he lived: a hero.”

HONOLULU (AP) — A major hurricane was churning across the Pacific Ocean but was several hundred miles south-southeast of Hawaii and posed no threat to the islands, forecasters said Tuesday.

Hurricane Iona is one of two major weather systems in the central Pacific Ocean.

In its latest advisory, the Miami-based U.S. National Hurricane Center said Iona was about 765 miles (1,230 kilometers) away from Honolulu, with maximum sustained winds near 125 mph (205 kph).

Additional strengthening was forecast later on Tuesday, with steady weakening expected to begin by Wednesday.

Hurricane Iona is the first named storm of the hurricane season in the central Pacific and emerged Sunday from a tropical depression. It continues to trek west over warm, open waters.

Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Keli has maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph), the NHC said Tuesday morning. It was about 890 miles (1,435 kilometers) southeast of Honolulu and was moving west at about 13 mph (20 kph).

No coastal watches or warnings were in effect for the storms.

The administrator of the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency on Monday hosted a statewide conference call with all counties, during which the National Weather Service provided an assessment and status of the storms.

“All counties are monitoring,” agency spokesperson Kiele Amundson said in an email.

Another indirect impact from the weather systems could be swells, but they are relatively small and moving westward and won't create anything significant, said Derek Wroe with the weather service in Honolulu.




However, a large swell is headed toward Hawaii after being generated several hundred miles east of New Zealand.

It's expected to arrive in Hawaii by Thursday, about the same time the storms pass the state.

“People might wrongly attribute the swell energy to be from these tropical systems, but they're actually not,” he said.

Fox News host Greg Gutfeld and the panel discuss Pete Buttigieg's $80 billion investment in diversity, equity and inclusion in aviation on ‘Gutfeld!'

FIRST ON FOX: Duke Health, the medical arm of Duke University in North Carolina, is seeing more than $100 million in federal funding frozen in compliance with President Donald Trump's executive order prohibiting DEI practices.

In a letter to Duke President Vincent Price, Chairman of the Board of Trustees Adam Silver and School of Medicine Dean Mary Klotman, Secretaries Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and Linda McMahon outlined that racial preferences in hiring, student admissions, governance and patient care ""betray"" the mission of American health care and ""endanger human lives.""

""The United States invests in medical care and research because of the sacredness of human life and value of human health,"" the letter read. 

""There is arguably no other area of our educational system where the rejection of merit is more dangerous than in medicine, where the competence of doctors means the difference between life and death for patients, and where scientific discovery is the difference between life-saving cures and the ravages of disease.""

DEPT. OF EDUCATION LAUNCHES INVESTIGATION INTO DUKE UNIVERSITY OVER ALLEGED RACIAL PREFERENCES

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (Getty Images)

Kennedy and McMahon said their respective agencies have been investigating allegations that Duke Health's practices may be violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and Section 1557 of the ObamaCare law.

Therefore, the secretaries said, the situation ""render[s] Duke Health unfit for any further financial relationship with the federal government.""

A senior administration official told Fox News Digital the ultimate amount of the frozen funding is $108 million.

The Civil Rights Act code cited prohibits recipients of financial assistance from denying benefits or discriminating against individuals based on race, color or national origin.

The Affordable Care Act section cited extends health care protections for federal funding that forbid the aforementioned discrimination, adding the fields of disability, age and sex.

Duke Health allegedly engaged in ""illegal and wrongful racial preferences and discriminatory activity in recruitment, student admissions, scholarships and financial aid, mentoring and enrichment programs, hiring, promotion, and more,"" according to Kennedy and McMahon.

TRUMP ADMIN PROBE ACCUSES HARVARD OF DISCRIMINATING AGAINST JEWISH STUDENTS, THREATENS TO PULL ALL FUNDING

They called such racism ""vile"" and said it ""hides behind a smug superiority"" that ""such [so-called] ‘benefitted' races cannot compete under merit-based consideration.""

""Affirmative action undermines America's commitment to merit-based justice and violates the nation's civil rights laws. In the medical context, this illegal preferencing also breaks faith with patients, hinders medical discovery, and jeopardizes human life and health.""

The feds kept the door open to future partnerships with Duke, noting the school and hospital have long had a commitment to medical excellence and would prefer to see it ""repair these problems.""

In order to return to good standing, Duke Health must review all policies and procedures in terms of illegal use of race preference, take immediate action and provide verifiable assurances to Washington that the medical unit will operate in ""good faith"" once more.

""If the alleged offending policies, practices, and programs are found to exist and remain unrectified after six months, or if at any time the Merit and Civil Rights Committee and federal government reach an impasse, the federal government will commence enforcement proceedings as appropriate,"" the secretaries warned in closing.

Fox News Digital reached out to Duke via Price's office and also solicited comment from Silver via his day job as NBA commissioner.

Fox News national correspondent Bryan Llenas reports on the public reaction, including fiery comments from Vice President JD Vance, to a violent street brawl in Cincinnati now under investigation as a potential hate crime.

CINCINNATI – Business owners near the site of a viral weekend beatdown in downtown Cincinnati scorned the suspects in the ""extremely out-of-control"" assault that has captured nationwide attention. 

The early Saturday morning melee on the corner of Fourth Street and Elm Street, which caused a national outcry after being circulated on social media, took place outside a popular nightclub called LoVe and the late-night restaurant next door.

In the video, a mob viciously assaulted two people, including a woman who was knocked out cold while bystanders filmed instead of intervening.

He described the brutal assault as a ""hate crime"" and said the city's downtown is no stranger to mobs of people taking to the streets at night. 

""That bar tends to get very crowded, and the crowd spills out into the street,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""Sometimes you can't even drive your car down the street because there's so many people out there partying. It's not just [Saturday] night. It happens every weekend, and nobody records anything, really.""

Koch explained that LoVe is relatively new to the downtown business district and said that despite their best efforts, the police can't control the crowds. 

""It's a nuisance,"" Koch said bluntly. 

LoVe did not return a comment request.

CINCINNATI POLICE CHIEF SAYS OUT OF 100 PEOPLE WATCHING AND RECORDING VIOLENT ATTACK, ONLY 1 CALLED 911

Koch told Fox News Digital that residents are ready to fight back but recognized that not everyone downtown on the weekends is looking to cause trouble. 

""Most of the time, the people that are partying are not villains, or they're not part of the violence that just got extremely out of control,"" he said. 

Despite the weekend crowds, Koch defended the city, calling it ""generally safe.""

BRUTAL DOWNTOWN BRAWL LEAVES VICTIMS BLOODIED AS CINCINNATI POLICE LAUNCH INVESTIGATION

""You can bring your family down and walk all around downtown and know that nothing's going to happen to you.""

Justin Karp owns Main Auction Galleries, next door to Koch's store. His family has owned that business for 150 years, 80 of which have been spent at the location on Fourth Street. 

He denounced the assault, saying violence is never the answer. 

""I don't know how it started, but I do know that there was a big fight,"" he said. ""A couple of people were severely outnumbered, and people would rather, I guess, film than help. Is that really the best solution?""

Disappointed, he described the fight as a ""poor reflection"" on the city. 

""When you think of Jazz Fest now, that's what they're going to think about, not the 70,000 people coming here for music and entertainment and food and why they were here,"" he said, referring to the city's jazz festival that was ongoing during the assault. 

The Downtown Residents Council is holding a special meeting on public safety at 6 p.m. Tuesday at the Cincinnati Public Library.

On Monday, Cincinnati Chief of Police Teresa Theetge said in a news conference that about 100 people witnessed the fight, and only one called 911.

""That is unacceptable to not call the police,"" she said. ""Traffic was horrendous. People saw this. They were fighting in front of traffic. Why didn't people call us?""

Authorities have charged at least five suspects in the attack, though officials have not released the identities of the suspects or the charges they are facing.

Phil Collins has been hospitalized – but not for a terminal illness.  

Despite swirling rumors online that sparked concern among fans, the legendary Genesis frontman, 74, is currently recovering from knee surgery and is not in hospice care, his representative told People.

Any speculation that Collins is in hospice is ""completely incorrect,"" his rep clarified.

Reps for Collins did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

The rumors of Collins being admitted to hospice care come after he opened up about his health challenges earlier this year. 

In February, Collins shared in an interview with Mojo that he isn't ""hungry"" to make new music due to his ongoing health issues – in 2022, the legendary musician revealed he could no longer play the drums because it was too difficult to pick up his drumsticks.

""I keep thinking I should go downstairs to the studio and see what happens. But I'm not hungry for it anymore. The thing is, I've been sick. I mean very sick,"" Collins said.

The most recent original work Collins did was in 2002 for his solo album, ""Testify."" In 2010, he released ""Going Back,"" which consisted of covers from Motown, but he has not released any material since.

Collins was forced to step back from drumming back in 2007 when he suffered a serious spinal injury that led to lasting nerve damage. 

""My vertebrae have been crushing my spinal cord because of the position I drum in,"" Collins told the Daily Mail in 2009.

""It comes from years of playing,"" he said. ""I can't even hold the sticks properly without it being painful. I even used to tape the sticks to my hands to get through.""

Collins joined Genesis in 1970, when the band was fronted by singer-songwriter Peter Gabriel. In 1975, Gabriel left the band, and Collins took over as the lead singer and face of Genesis. 

In 1996, Collins officially left the band to pursue a solo career, although he had had massive solo success in the 1980s.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

Fox News contributor Michael Pillsbury joins 'Fox & Friends First' to weigh in on President Donald Trump's trade negotiations with China as they continue to threaten their invasion of Taiwan. 

China may soon gain greater influence over the Panama Canal following the collapse of a proposed deal between U.S.-based BlackRock and Hong Kong's CK Hutchison, which had initially sparked tensions with Beijing.

The original agreement would have transferred control of dozens of international ports — including two in Panama — to a consortium involving BlackRock. The deal was reportedly welcomed by former President Donald Trump, who voiced support for reducing Chinese influence over the canal and even floated the idea of the U.S. ""taking back"" the strategic waterway.

However, Beijing pushed back. China advocated for state-owned shipping giant Cosco to be included in the transaction, signaling its desire for a direct stake, not just an indirect one through the Hong Kong-based Hutchison, in the canal's operations.

Amid mounting pressure from China and the threat of an anti-monopoly investigation, CK Hutchison announced Monday that the exclusive negotiation window with BlackRock had expired. However, the company also signaled its openness to reconfiguring the deal.

CHINA, HONG KONG THREATEN TO THWART SALE OF PANAMA CANAL PORTS TO AMERICA'S BLACKROCK

It said it would ""remain open to discussions with a view to inviting a major strategic investor from the [People's Republic of China] to join as a significant member of the consortium."" According to the company, changes in deal structure and participant makeup are necessary to gain approval from ""all relevant authorities.""

The original $23 billion deal involved transferring ownership of 43 ports across 23 countries — including the two critical Panamanian ports located at either end of the canal in Balboa and Cristobal. CK Hutchison has operated both since 1997. The firm is owned by the family of Hong Kong's wealthiest man, Li Ka-shing.

China's growing footprint in Latin American infrastructure has long raised bipartisan alarms in Washington. However, Trump stands out as the first modern U.S. president to suggest reclaiming the Panama Canal, which the U.S. completed in 1914 and handed over to Panama in 1999 under a treaty signed in 1977 during the Carter administration.

CHINA'S BILLION-DOLLAR FOOTPRINT NEAR FLORIDA COAST POSES US NATIONAL SECURITY RISK, EXPERT WARNS

""China is operating the Panama Canal, and we didn't give it to China — we gave it to Panama — and we're taking it back,"" Trump recently declared.

One analyst believes China may ultimately be excluded from the Panama port holdings while gaining control of most other assets in the larger deal.

""China will insist this be the quid pro quo: that the other global ports have Cosco participation. And obviously, Cosco is already a major global port holder,"" said Dane Chamorro, head of Global Risk Analysis at consulting firm Control Risks, in an interview with Fox News Digital.

""From a U.S. perspective, they might say, ‘Okay, great—we got Hutchison, or China (since they tend to refer to them interchangeably), out of the two Panama ports.' But in the long run, that may result in even more ports globally ending up in the hands of a Chinese state-owned entity.""

If that happens, Cosco — through this broader consolidation — would become ""far and away the dominant port owner and operator globally,"" Chamorro said. ""That aligns with the fact that China is the world's largest trading economy, the largest manufacturing economy, and the largest shipbuilder.""

Chamorro also noted that U.S. companies do not operate on the same global scale in the port industry as Chinese, Hong Kong or Singaporean firms.

The failed Hutchison-BlackRock deal underscores the precarious position of Hong Kong businesses under growing pressure from Beijing to prioritize national loyalty — even when it threatens ties with Western partners.

Meanwhile, Panama insists it retains full sovereignty over the canal itself and maintains that Hutchison's operation of the port facilities does not grant China any influence over canal operations.

A shooting Monday at an office building in New York City that is home to the Blackstone investment firm and the NFL left four people dead, including an NYPD officer.

Covered by: Louis Casiano, Greg Wehner, Bradford Betz, Alexis McAdams, Christina Shaw, Alex Nitzberg, Greg Norman, Ryan Gaydos, Ryan Morik and Stepheny Price


A lone gunman, identified as Shane Tamura, walked into a midtown Manhattan office building Monday and opened fire, killing four people before turning the gun on himself. 

The four people killed in the shooting were identified as NYPD Officer Didarul Islam, Blackstone executive Wesley LePatner, security guard Aland Etienne and an employee with Rudin Management.

New York City Mayor Eric Adams said Tamura appeared to take the wrong elevator bank inside 345 Park Avenue Monday when he carried out his attack, adding that ""it appears as though he was going after the employees at the NFL.""

The motive for the shooting remains unclear, but the gunman reportedly had a grievance with the NFL, blaming the sport of football for apparent issues with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a side effect from repeated hits to the head.

Aland Etienne was identified as one of the four victims of the New York City office building shooting.


The Service Employees International Union, Local 32BJ, described Etienne as “a dedicated security officer who took his job duties extremely seriously.”

“We are devastated to hear the reports of the shooting at 345 Park Avenue. We extend our deep condolences to the families and friends who lost loved ones tonight, including that of our own 32BJ SEIU security member Aland Etienne,"" the union's president Manny Pastreich said in a statement.

“We have been in touch with Aland Etienne's family and are working with building management and the NYPD to support their investigation. We are ensuring our members in the building receive the free union counseling and support services they deserve and need to manage this unspeakable loss,” he added.


“This tragedy speaks to the sacrifice of security officers who risk their lives every day to keep New Yorkers and our buildings safe,” Pastreich also said. “Every time a security officer puts on their uniform, they put their lives on the line. Their contributions to our city are essential, though often unappreciated. Aland Etienne is a New York hero. We will remember him as such.”

The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said Tuesday that it is providing “investigative support” to the NYPD “following the incident that occurred yesterday in Manhattan, NY.”


“We are deeply saddened by the loss of four lives, including Police Officer Didarul Islam. Our thoughts are with their families, friends, and colleagues during this difficult time,” it wrote in a post on X.

The four people killed in the shooting were identified as Islam, Blackstone executive Wesley LePatner, security guard Aland Etienne and Julia Hyman, an associate at Rudin Management.





The New York City Medical Examiner's Office told Fox News that it's investigating the death of gunman Shane Tamura and will study his brain as part of the standard autopsy procedure. 


The motive for the shooting remains unclear, but Tamura reportedly had a grievance with the NFL, blaming the sport of football for apparent issues with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a side effect from repeated hits to the head. 

The office said it will share the cause and manner of death determination for Tamura when available.

The 27-year-old turned the gun on himself last night after killing four people inside an office building in Manhattan that is home to companies including the NFL. 

Fox News' Tamara Gitt and Ryan Gaydos contributed to this report. 





Sen. Chuck Schumer revealed Tuesday on the Senate floor that he once worked at 345 Park Avenue, the site of the shooting Monday in New York City.


“Yesterday, my city -- the greatest city on earth -- was shattered when a gunman took the lives of four innocent New Yorkers in cold blood, just four blocks from my office in Midtown Manhattan,” Schumer said. “I actually worked in the building where the shooting took place for one summer as a summer associate at a law firm.”

Schumer said he “walked that stretch of Park Avenue a thousand times” and described it as “one of the busiest, safest, most iconic parts of Manhattan.”

“I want to thank the first responders who ran toward the gunfire -- all of the cops, EMTs, firefighters that got there fast and prevented even more bloodshed. They're heroes, every one of them,” he added. 

A Rudin Management employee was identified as another one of the victims of the New York City shooting, sources told the New York Post.


“The Rudin family and everyone at our company are devastated by yesterday's senseless tragedy. Our thoughts and prayers are with those injured and lost last night, including our cherished Rudin colleague, a brave New York City police officer, a beloved lobby security guard and an employee at a tenant firm,"" the Rudin family said in a statement.

""We are grateful to the NYPD, FBI, EMS and multiple other emergency responders for their swift and courageous action. We also thank the Mayor and Police Commissioner for their leadership. The building will remain closed today as the authorities continue their investigations,"" they added. ""As New Yorkers, we stand shoulder to shoulder in the face of this hatred, we grieve with the families and loved ones of those lost, and we pray for the full recovery of those injured.”

Earlier this morning, financial firm Blackstone identified Wesley LePatner as an executive who was killed in the attack.


LePatner, a senior managing director, was Blackstone's Global Head of Core+ Real Estate and the Chief Executive Officer of the Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust.

The shooting left NYPD Officer Didarul Islam and one other person dead.

A makeshift memorial is forming Tuesday outside 345 Park Avenue, the site of the shooting in New York City
 that left four people dead.

Images taken at the scene showed bystanders leaving flowers.





NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell praised NYPD Officer Didarul Islam in a memo to employees who were at the building where a crazed gunman killed four and injured others in a shooting.

Goodell said in the memo, obtained by Fox News Digital, that one NFL employee was ""seriously injured"" but in stable condition. He mentioned Islam and thanked him for sacrificing his life to save others.

""We are deeply grateful to the law enforcement officers who responded to this threat quickly and decisively and to Officer Islam, who gave his life to protect others,"" the memo read.

The 36-year-old had been on the force for four years before he was gunned down Monday evening. He was a married father to two young boys, and his wife is pregnant with their third child, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said.

Fox News' Scott Thompson contributed to this report.


The National Football League Players' Association (NFLPA) released a statement early Tuesday morning regarding the New York City shooting that killed four people in the office building of the league's headquarters.

""We are deeply saddened by the tragic incident that occurred yesterday in New York City. 345 Park Avenue is a part of our football family, and we at the NFLPA extend our sincere condolences and support to the people who work in this building and to the families of those who lost their lives,"" the NFLPA said.

""We also want to express our deep gratitude to the law enforcement and emergency personnel who responded to those impacted.""

Mayor Eric Adams said in a news briefing on Tuesday that it is believed that the shooter, identified as Shane Tamura, was targeting the league - it is not known if specific people were intended targets.

Adams said the shooter was trying to get to NFL HQ but took the wrong elevator bank. Adams added that the gunman alluded to having suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and that he had a grievance against the NFL in a ""suicide note."" Tamura was a high school football player at Granada Hills Charter in Granada Hills, California.

The Democrat governor of New York is calling for a “national assault weapons ban” following the shooting in New York City last night.


“The killer used an AR-15–style assault rifle. The same weapon of war used in mass shootings across America,” Kathy Hochul said in a statement Tuesday. “New York has some of the strongest gun laws in the nation. We banned assault weapons. We strengthened our Red Flag Law. We closed dangerous loopholes. But our laws only go so far when an AR-15 can be obtained in a state with weak gun laws and brought into New York to commit mass murder.

“The time to act is now. The American people are tired of thoughts and prayers,” she added. “They deserve action. Congress must summon the courage to stand up to the gun lobby and finally pass a national assault weapons ban before more innocent lives are stolen.”

Hochul also called the shooting a “horrific act of violence” and said her heart is with the loved ones of slain NYPD officer Didarul Islam, “his NYPD family and every victim of this tragedy.”

New York City Mayor Eric Adams revealed Tuesday that gunman Shane Tamura appeared to take the wrong elevator bank inside 345 Park Avenue Monday when he carried out his attack. 

Adams, speaking to Fox 5 New York, said ""it appears as though he was going after the employees at the NFL.""

The mayor said there were two elevator banks inside the building and Tamura “appeared to have gone to the wrong bank and he ended up on the floor of Rudin Management.  

“And you see on the video that he discharged the weapon several times and we must commend Rudin Management for the safety precautions that they have put in place, even a safe bathroom where you can lock it down with a bulletproof door. Some of the staffers used that,” Adams continued. 


“It's unfortunate that during these days and times, active shooter drills are taking place all across the country and Rudin Management did their job of clearly having those active shooter drills and the staffers who were in the building were able to utilize some of the safe rooms and I believe it played a great role in saving lives of some of the staffers,” Adams added. 

“It was after 6 p.m. and so many people were no longer in the office, but he appeared to have gone to the wrong floor and due to the wrong elevator bank where you can see on the front desk, which elevator bank was the NFL. But he did not go to that bank,” Adams also said.

President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he has been “briefed on the tragic shooting that took place in Manhattan, a place that I know and love.


“I trust our Law Enforcement Agencies to get to the bottom of why this crazed lunatic committed such a senseless act of violence,” he wrote in a post on Truth Social. “My heart is with the families of the four people who were killed, including the NYPD Officer, who made the ultimate sacrifice. God Bless the New York Police Department, and God Bless New York!”

Financial firm Blackstone identified Wesley LePatner as the executive who was killed in Monday night's shooting in New York City.

LePatner, a senior managing director, was Blackstone's Global Head of Core+ Real Estate and the Chief Executive Officer of the Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust.

“We are heartbroken to share that our colleague, Wesley LePatner, was among those who lost their lives in the tragic incident at 345 Park Avenue. Words cannot express the devastation we feel,” the company said in a statement.


“Wesley was a beloved member of the Blackstone family and will be sorely missed. She was brilliant, passionate, warm, generous, and deeply respected within our firm and beyond. She embodied the best of Blackstone. Our prayers are with her husband, children and family,” it added. “We are also saddened by the loss of the other innocent victims as well, including brave security personnel and NYPD.”

Blackstone said prior to LePatner joining their company, she “spent over a decade at Goldman Sachs, most recently as a Managing Director in the Real Estate Investment Group within the Asset Management Division.

“She also worked in Goldman Sachs' Real Estate Principal Investment Area and Real Estate Investment Banking Group, where she began her career,” reads a bio of LePatner on Blackstone's website. 





New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced Tuesday that “As a mark of respect for the memory of NYPD Officer Didarul Islam who died in the line of duty and the multiple victims of the mass shooting in Midtown Manhattan at 345 Park Avenue yesterday, I've ordered all flags on all city buildings and stationary flagstaffs throughout the five boroughs to be lowered to half-staff until further notice.” 

“Officer Didarul Islam died as he lived, a hero and protector of New York City. We will never forget you,” Adams wrote in another post on X.

The gunman who stormed a high-rise building in the heart of New York City on Monday evening reportedly had a grievance with the NFL.

Shane Tamura, who was identified as the man who killed multiple people including an NYPD officer in the rampage at 345 Park Ave in Midtown Manhattan, cited the NFL in a note left near his body on 33rd floor of the building after he died by suicide, the New York Post reported


The 27-year-old Nevada resident blamed the sport of football for apparent issues with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a side effect from repeated hits to the head, the outlet reported, citing law enforcement sources.

Fox News Digital reached out to the NYPD and the NFL for comment.

Tamura was a high school football player at Granada Hills Charter in Granada Hills, California, which is about 25 miles northwest of Los Angeles.

The NFL's headquarters were located in the same building where Tamura had killed five people and left several others injured. The league's officers are on the fifth floor..

Financial firm Blackstone said it has lost “one of our most beloved colleagues” in the shooting at an office building in New York City Monday night.


“As everyone knows, an active shooter entered 345 Park this evening, which resulted in multiple deaths including taking his own life,” the company said in an internal memo to staff, which was obtained by Fox News Digital.

“We know we lost one of our most beloved colleagues, whose identity we are withholding for now out of respect for the family,” it added.

Three other people were killed – including a New York City Police Department Officer – during the attack.

The building targeted by shooter Shane Tamura is home to Blackstone and is the headquarters for the NFL.

The New York City Police Department said slain officer Didarul Islam “represented the very best of our department.”

“He was protecting New Yorkers from danger when his life was tragically cut short today,” it added in a post on X.
 “We join in prayer during this time of incomprehensible pain. We will forever honor his legacy.”

The 36-year-old had been on the force for four years before he was gunned down Monday evening. He was a married father to two young boys and his wife is pregnant with their third child, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said.

Islam, an immigrant from Bangladesh who was assigned to the NYPD's 47th Precinct in the Bronx, was one of two uniformed officers in the Park Avenue high-rise when the shooting occurred.

Both of the officers were working there as part of the paid detail program, which allows companies to hire uniformed officers as extra security, Tisch said.

Rep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., swiftly pointed the finger at Republicans' opposition to gun control in the wake of the deadly shooting in New York City.

""He drove from Las Vegas to New York with an AR-15, which cannot be purchased in New York. He walked into an office building and started spraying the lobby with that AR-15, killing the police officer whose handgun was no match for the AR-15. This isn't about New York. This is about Republicans persistently blocking common sense gun safety reform, including an assault weapons ban, that a super majority of Americans support,"" Goldman declared in a post on X.





Goldman made the remarks when responding to comments by Trump-backed Ohio gubernatorial hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy.

""Another brave police officer murdered in cold blood in New York tonight. This isn't just tragedy, it's the cost of weak leadership and anti-cop policies. No more coddling criminals. No more “defund the police.” Time to crush the spread of crime & make American cities safe again,"" Ramaswamy wrote.

Photos taken by Fox News Digital show officers outside of the gated community believed to be the residence of lone gunman Shane Tamura in Las Vegas on Monday evening.

Tamura can be seen on surveillance video exiting a BMW and carrying a rifle as he enters the Park Avenue skyscraper that is home to Blackstone and the NFL headquarters.

Upon entering the building, he opens fire on an NYPD officer and a woman as they attempt to take cover before “spraying” the lobby with gunfire.

He then makes his way to the elevator where he allows a woman to go free before taking a ride to the 33rd floor where he shoots additional victims and then finally takes his own life.



The dignified transfer of the late NYPD Police Officer Didarul Islam takes place at New York Presbyterian Well Cornell Medical Center after midnight following the mass shooting attack that killed him and three others while wounding a fifth person in Manhattan, New York, United States on July 29, 2025.



Officers of the NYPD gathered at Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan early Tuesday morning to pay their respects as part of a dignified transfer for the remains of Officer Didarul Islam.


The officers were joined by relatives and friends to honor the service of the officer, who was gunned down in cold blood while serving with the NYPD.

Islam, 36, served on the force for three-and-a-half-years and leaves behind his pregnant wife and two children.

At the time of the shooting Islam was providing security at the Park Avenue skyscraper that was home to Blackstone and the NFL headquarters.

NYC Mayor Eric Adams also took part, praising Islam as a hero who died protecting fellow New Yorkers.


“He was saving lives. He was protecting New Yorkers,” Mayor Eric Adams said in a news conference at the Manhattan hospital where he was pronounced dead. “He embodies what this city is all about. He's a true blue New Yorker, not only in a uniform he wore.”

The shooter's motive remains unclear and the NYPD are working alongside the FBI to investigate the incident.



NYPD responds to active shooter reports in midtown Manhattan building



An employee of the NFL
 was reportedly ""seriously injured"" in the mass shooting that occurred at 345 Park Avenue in midtown Manhattan, home to the headquarters for the league. 

The office building, which sits on 52nd Street and Park Avenue, was the site of a tragic mass shooting that left five dead, including one police officer, when a gunman unleashed fire inside before taking his own life. 

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell sent a message, obtained by Fox News Digital, to all league employees announcing the traumatic event.

New York City Mayor Eric Adams shared a video on X early Tuesday morning as he was en route to the hospital to conduct a dignified transfer of officer Didarul Islam.

In the video, Adams expressed condolences and honored Officer Islam's ultimate sacrifice.


“I'm on the way to the dignified transfer of fallen police officer Didarul Islam, who was killed in tonight's senseless mass shooting in Midtown Manhattan. He put his life on the line for all of us and died a hero. He and his family are in my prayers tonight, and I'm praying for the families of the three other innocent people killed tonight, as well as the fifth victim still fighting for their life,” the post read.

Islam lost his life after a lone gunman walked into a midtown Manhattan office building Monday afternoon and opened fire, killing four – including an NYPD officer – before taking his own life.





Police Commissioner Jessica S. Tisch confirmed in a press conference late Monday that there is no longer an active threat to the public.  NYPD believe that the now deceased gunman acted alone.

Speaking at a press conference later Monday, NYC Police
 Commissioner Jessica Tisch identified the shooter as Shane Temura, a 27-year-old Las Vegas resident with a history of mental health issues. 

Tisch said Tamura had driven across state lines, with his vehicle having been seen as recently as 4:24 p.m. Monday in Columbia, New Jersey, not long before he unleashed a barrage of gunfire.

Security video shows the gunman who killed multiple people at an office building in midtown Manhattan entering the lobby and immediately opening fire and striking several people, including a police officer, authorities said Monday.

He then shot a security guard taking cover behind a desk with an M4 assault rifle, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said.

The gunman, identified as Shane Tamura, then waited for an elevator and allowed a woman to exit unharmed before going to the 33rd floor.

He then shot and killed another person before shooting himself, police said.


Tamura, who was licensed to carry a concealed weapon in the state of Nevada, killed four people and wounded another.

A multinational accounting firm with offices in the midtown Manhattan building where a gunman killed four people issued a statement hours after the deadly rampage.

“Our hearts go out to the victims of this horrific act and their families,” a statement from KPMG said. ""We are incredibly grateful for the bravery of building security and law enforcement.""

The company has offices in the 44-story Park Avenue office building. New York City is home to the first KPMG office in the United States.

The London-based company provides accounting services some of the country's largest and most prominent businesses, according to its website.



Didarul Islam, 36, was identified as the NYPD officer killed during Monday's shooting. He was an immigrant from Bangladesh and left behind two sons and a pregnant wife, police said.



The slain New York City police officer was who killed by a gunman in a Manhattan office building immigrated to the U.S. from Bangladesh and left behind a pregnant wife, authorities said.

Didarul Islam, 36, had been on the force for four years before he was gunned down Monday evening. He was a married father to two young boys and his wife is pregnant with their third child, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said.

Islam, an immigrant from Bangladesh who was assigned to the NYPD's 47th Precinct in the Bronx, was one of two uniformed officers in the Park Avenue high-rise when the shooting occurred.

""He put himself in harms way,"" Tisch said. ""He made the ultimate sacrifice.""

""He died as he lived: a hero,"" she added.

Both of the officers were working there as part of the paid detail program, which allows companies to hire uniformed officers as extra security, Tisch said.

New York Mayor Eric Adams, a former NYPD officer, said he met with Islam's family.

""This was his dad's only son,"" he said. ""It is unimaginable to experience a loss of this magnitude.""

Shane Tamura, the suspected gunman who killed five people, including an NYPD officer, inside a midtown Manhattan office building, drove across the country to New York City from Las Vegas, authorities said Monday.


Tamura traveled through Colorado on July 26, and through Nebraska and Iowa the next day, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said during a Monday night news conference.

Tamura's vehicle was then seen in Columbia, New Jersey as recently as 4:24 p.m. Monday, not long before he would unleash a barrage of gunfire in New York, police said.

New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mandani is facing renewed scrutiny for his past stances on policing in the wake of an office building mass shooting in midtown Manhattan that left four civilians dead as well as a police officer.

The shooter was neutralized as more information is being learned about the alleged gunman, Shane Tamura of Las Vegas.


""I'm heartbroken to learn of the horrific shooting in Midtown and I am holding the victims, their families, and the NYPD officer in critical condition in my thoughts. Grateful for all of our first responders on the ground,"" Mamdani posted to X on Monday night.

In the replies, people quickly shared images of a June 8, 2020, post where Mamdani said ""No, we want to defund the police"" and a Nov. 5, 2020, post where he said ""Queer liberation means defund the police.""

Actor Jonathan Bennett tells Fox News Digital he's excited about his ‘Mean Girls' co-star Lindsay Lohan's return to acting and discusses co-hosting ChristmasCon with Lacey Chabert.

Anthony Anderson has addressed his viral clip telling a teenage Lindsay Lohan that he likes them ""young"" in 2003.

Over 20 years ago, Anderson filled in for Sharon Osbourne on ""The Sharon Osbourne Show"" when he interviewed Lohan, who was 17 at the time. 

""This interview was clearly intended as comedy. He regrets if the humor was in poor taste and maintains the utmost respect for Lindsay,"" a spokesperson for Anderson told Entertainment Weekly.

In a clip of the interview that has resurfaced online, Anderson asked Lohan about her home life, and she informed him that she had recently moved in with Disney Channel star Raven-Symone.

""This interview was clearly intended as comedy. He regrets if the humor was in poor taste and maintains the utmost respect for Lindsay.""

""Both of you are beautiful women. Both of you are young and have your own individual styles,"" Anderson said, before asking how they would compromise on decorating the home.

The landmark trade deal reached between the United States and the European Union shows the power President Donald Trump wielded to exact major concessions from trading partners that would have been shocking just months ago.

As part of the deal reached in Scotland between President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Europe agreed to accept 15% import tariffs on most goods, with exceptions. While much higher than pre-Trump, that number is down from the 30% level being menaced by the U.S. But accepting such a deal signals a shift in what many thought Europe might have received at the outset of talks.

“It's kind of a testimony to the normalization of protection,” said Bill Reinsch, an expert in trade policy with the Center for Strategic and International Studies who served for 15 years as president of the National Foreign Trade Council. “Because if in March, if anybody in the EU had said we're going to accept a 15% tariff, you know, they would have been thrown out of the room.”

“And here it is now, sort of this is what we're going to do ­— it's kind of an extraordinary evolution,” Reinsch told the Washington Examiner.

The deal struck by Trump flies in the face of decades of trade policy pursued by both parties in Washington. Over the years, presidents have sought to reach agreements with trade partners to lower trade barriers on both sides by offering the inducement of easing tariffs and restrictions imposed by the U.S. Economists generally argue that tariffs only hurt consumers, because the higher costs will be passed along to them.

Trump, in contrast, views imposing higher tariffs on other countries while gaining greater access to their markets as a victory, and appears to have achieved that outcome in the talks with the EU. Trump has argued that imposing tariffs on trading partners will help rebalance the U.S. trade deficit.

One senior White House official told the Washington Examiner the deal is a “huge win” and that the administration is “naturally euphoric.”“Six months ago, if you just told the average person, ‘Hey the EU is going to make these sort of commitments that they just made in this deal,' we would have been called kind of crazy,” the official said. “So, yeah, I think this is a very big deal.”

Another White House official called the deal “the big one” and emphasized that talks are ongoing with several countries, including some other “large fish.”

“President Trump finally got the European Union to open their markets to American-made products, and secured the largest trade deal and investments from the EU in history,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Washington Examiner. “President Trump appreciates President Von Der Leyen's efforts to reach this deal, and fully trusts and expects the EU will live up to their bold, new commitments.”

As part of the deal, the U.S. agreed to lower its auto tariffs to 15% from 25%. While that is a better deal for automakers than before, the 15% still represents a high barrier. More importantly for the U.S., the EU agreed to eliminate tariffs on cars imported from the U.S.

In addition to accepting the 15% tariffs on most goods, Europe also agreed to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S., and to buy $750 billion in U.S. energy products. Trump called it “the biggest deal ever made.”

The agreement has also been poorly received by some political figures in Europe. For instance, French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou panned the deal as an act of submission from Europe to the U.S.

“It is a dark day when an alliance of free peoples, brought together to affirm their common values and to defend their common interests, resigns itself to submission,” Bayrou said over the weekend on X.

Still, other European officials appear to have accepted the plan and have noted that, absent such a deal, things might have been much worse.

“This agreement has succeeded in averting a trade conflict that would have hit the export-oriented German economy hard,” German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said, according to Reuters.

EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic has also argued that this is “clearly the best deal we could get under very difficult circumstances.”

The stock market's reaction to the development was somewhat mixed, but it was much less dramatic than when the Trump administration first announced the sweeping trade policy changes as part of its “Liberation Day” push. Then, the markets tanked, and investors raised fears about a recession.

The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose slightly on Monday's announcement but later pared back those gains and ended slightly in the red. Major U.S. stock indices also were largely flat as the information was digested. Notably, many details of the deal reached between Trump and von der Leyen are still unclear.

“I think that swapping uncertainty with some higher degree of certainty is a kind of positive,” Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate, told the Washington Examiner.

But Hamrick pointed out that many questions remain. He pointed out that the 15% rate is still far higher than before the Trump administration came into office, and there are open questions related to inflation and economic growth. Before Trump came into office, the average tariff on U.S. imports from the EU was 1.2%.

Also, Trump is pushing to get more U.S. vehicles into a European market long dominated by non-American vehicles. But that, too, comes with questions, Hamrick said.

“There aren't too many people in Europe that are looking to drive an Escalade down a narrow Roman street,” he said.

Jon Toomey is the President of the Coalition for a Prosperous America, one of the leading groups advocating economic protectionism and the strategic use of tariffs. Toomey said that he thinks the U.S. is undergoing a readjustment in its approach about tariffs and trade policy.

“I think you're finally starting to see that a lot of these economists were in the groupthink dogma, and that they've been wrong for many decades, except for the team of economists at CPA,” Toomey told the Washington Examiner.

Overall, how the trade deal will affect each side remains to be seen. Reinsch, with CSIS, said that it is in the best interest of both sides to put a good face on the deal. He also noted that the EU might have gotten other benefits as part of the agreement that weren't initially announced.

Reinsch also said it was probably wise for von der Leyen to have worked on it directly with Trump.

“So I think it was a smart move on von der Leyen's part to seek a direct meeting, because I think she figured out that if you want to close, that's really the only way to do it,” Reinsch said.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

There is limited desire among Republicans on Capitol Hill to haul Obama-era CIA Director John Brennan back in front of lawmakers, despite accusations that he may have lied to Congress about statements related to 2016 Russian election meddling.

A years-old House Intelligence Committee report now available to the public appears to contradict statements made to Congress by Brennan in 2017, a document that was recently declassified by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard as part of a broader document dump she claims is evidence of a “treasonous conspiracy” by Obama officials to undermine Trump in 2016.

However, Republicans on Congress's intelligence committees suggest they have more pressing matters than nearly a decade-old testimony outside the statute of limitations for lying to lawmakers and that the Department of Justice is better equipped to investigate such allegations.

“I would let the federal agencies be able to walk back through it. It creates more and more drama here,” Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) said. “Sunshine is a good thing. It's wherever that comes out, however that comes out, get the information out.”

Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD) was unfamiliar with the House report but saw “other issues out there right now that are a lot more pressing.” He did not offer specific examples.

“As a committee that has oversight, we most certainly can take it up in regular order and look at it,” Rounds said. “But I think we've got other right issues right now that are going to be more time-consuming, and more top of mind than that right now.”

Sen. James Risch (R-ID), who also chairs the Foreign Relations Committee, declined to comment beyond expressing a desire for the Trump administration's investigations to play out.

“That thing's under investigation. Let them do their work,” Risch said.

The declassified information, coupled with other reports released by CIA Director John Ratcliffe and special counsel John Durham, suggests Brennan may have violated intelligence community standards, relied on information from the Steele dossier, and excluded contradicting evidence on Russian efforts to intervene for Trump's benefit. Brennan denied doing such things in statements to Congress.

Ratcliffe has suggested Brennan won't have statute of limitations protections because he believes there remains a conspiracy. Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey are reportedly the subjects of a criminal investigation by the bureau.

Brennan has rejected accusations of treason and manufacturing fake intelligence to hurt Trump's election chances as “baseless.” Gabbard referred Barack Obama last week to the DOJ for prosecution, despite current and former presidents having legal immunity from official acts taken in office.

Democrats have come to the defense of prior intelligence assessments and Obama officials, pointing to past inquiries, including a bipartisan Senate Intel panel report involving now-Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who at the time led the committee. They've accused the Trump administration of trying to distract from conservative blowback over releasing the Jeffrey Epstein files.

Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) criticized the House's declassified report as “partisan” and disqualifying. Gabbard has not directly rebutted the findings by the Senate or other government entities that agreed Russia launched a sweeping interference operation, but has suggested they were based on fake Obama-era intelligence.

“I would caution anybody on either side to take something that's one party,” Kelly said. “The Senate Intelligence Committee did a — not just bipartisan — but a unanimous, bipartisan report on Russian collusion in the 2016 election. I think people should go to that.”

Some House Intelligence Committee Republicans expressed more willingness to reopen the matter, given that it was their panel's report.

Its chairman, Rep. Rick Crawford (R-AR), referred to Brennan as “a documented liar, full stop.” But he added that “accountability isn't always about prosecuting individuals,” a likely reference to Brennan's testimony being outside the five-year statute of limitations for prosecution.

“In some cases, prosecuting may not be possible, but we can hold them to account by removing them from the [intelligence community] and ending their career as deep-state operatives,” Crawford said. “This should be the end goal for some of these middle-level employees who willfully participated or just went along with this, lacking the intestinal fortitude to stand up and refuse to go along with this conspiracy.”

The Department of Justice filed a misconduct complaint against U.S. District Chief Judge James Boasberg on Monday, alleging he made “improper public comments” about the Trump administration.

“These comments have undermined the integrity of the judiciary, and we will not stand for that,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in announcing the complaint.

The DOJ complaint refers to Boasberg's leaked comments in a meeting with other judges during a March 11 gathering of the Judicial Conference, a policymaking body consisting of top federal judges. Boasberg reportedly told fellow judges and Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts that his colleagues were “concern[ed] that the Administration would disregard rulings of federal courts leading to a constitutional crisis,” according to a memo reported by the Federalist.

Boasberg has sparred with the Trump administration for months over a court case involving the deportations of alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador.

Who is James Boasberg? DC judge at center of impeachment fight over Trump immigration plans

The federal government argued the deportations were authorized under the Alien Enemies Act, but the Obama-appointed judge issued a temporary restraining order instructing the Trump administration to return airplanes carrying illegal immigrants from Venezuela that were already en route to a notorious prison in El Salvador. Boasberg entered the order after the planes had already departed, and the aircraft was thus not turned around.

That order was issued on March 15, days after his comments to the other judges.

President Donald Trump has been particularly critical of Boasberg, suggesting the federal judge should be impeached over his handling of the deportation case. Now the DOJ is getting involved.

The new complaint alleges Boasberg violated ethical obligations through his public comments and calls for his removal from the case, in addition to disciplinary action. The document suggests Boasberg should be publicly reprimanded or recommended for impeachment amid a pending investigation.

DOJ SEES ‘BREACH OF THE JUDICIAL OATH' IN JUDGE'S LEAKED TRUMP CRITICISM

“Swift, visible action will reinforce the judiciary's institutional integrity by showing that judges are held to the same standards they enforce and deter comparable misconduct,” it states.

DOJ chief of staff Chad Mizelle filed the complaint with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit Chief Judge Sri Srinivasan, who can dismiss the complaint, conclude that appropriate action has been taken, or appoint a committee to reprimand Boasberg.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Senate leadership's hopes of passing a trio of spending bills before the August recess are dimming as senators from both parties raise objections.

Two Republicans told the Washington Examiner on Monday evening that they were blocking a request to bundle the three bills together, while a bloc of Democrats signaled they, too, would throw up procedural roadblocks that could drag the process out for days.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) is delaying the legislation, known as a minibus, over proposed restrictions on the level of THC that can be present in hemp, a cannabis-derived product grown in his home state of Kentucky. The provision is tucked in the agriculture bill that would be considered alongside appropriations for the Department of Veterans Affairs and other federal agencies.

“If we can get an agreement on that, then we'll release our hold on the bill,” Paul said.

Separately, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) is seeking to ensure that money flows to the Fort Leonard Wood military base in Missouri, citing a need for improvements to its housing and hospital infrastructure. The minibus would also fund military construction projects. 

“I want to make sure that we're actually doing right by them, that they're taken care of,” Hawley said.

The objections, and others like them, threaten to limit GOP progress on federal spending with weeks until a September shutdown deadline. Senate Republicans have begun to move the military construction legislation across the Senate floor, aiming to get consent to add the other two. However, Senate rules allow any senator to impede that request, and it would require 67 votes to suspend the rules.

Senate GOP leadership is not exploring that option for now as Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), the top Republican appropriator, negotiates with the holdouts.

“Obviously, I'd like to do three before we break for the recess,” Collins said as she left an appropriations meeting in Senate Majority Leader John Thune's (R-SD) office on Monday. She also spoke with House Appropriations Chairman Tom Cole (R-OK) over the weekend about plans for the minibus.

“He's very excited about that prospect, too, because then we could start doing some conference over the August recess,” she said. “So that would be real progress.”

The number of GOP “holds” has been shrinking. Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) said he had an initial objection over the VA's abortion policy, but later dropped it after speaking with the department.

Still, Paul said his negotiations with leadership were not “getting anywhere” and that he wanted a change in language, not simply an amendment vote. Meanwhile, Democrats who opposed a floor vote last week that jump-started the appropriations process sounded unlikely to help expedite Senate passage without concessions of their own.

In particular, Democrats have asked for assurances that Republicans won't pass another clawback in funds like the rescission bill that passed Congress this month in a party-line vote. The legislation revoked $9 billion in foreign aid and public broadcasting dollars that Congress had previously appropriated.

“I'm skeptical of the whole process,” said Sen. Adam Schiff (R-CA), one of the procedural “no” votes. “If they're gonna govern by rescission and reconciliation, then whatever we produce here may simply be temporary and eviscerated on a partisan basis.”

Collins has already made at least one concession. She dropped appropriations for the legislative branch out of the minibus at the request of Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA), who wanted lower funding levels.

But Democrats have yet to address the objections within their own caucus. Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA), the top Democratic appropriator, told the Washington Examiner she is waiting to see if Republicans “have an agreement to put things together.”

“We're working through them and we're making good progress on our side,” Collins said of her negotiations. “I hope the Democrats will start their process soon.”

MIKE WALTZ UN NOMINATION ADVANCES AFTER BRIEF SENATE DELAY

Senators are in Washington, D.C., for the remainder of the week, and likely the weekend, as they seek a separate deal on a backlog of Trump administration nominees that require Senate confirmation.

On Monday, Thune said that Republicans had not “ruled out” keeping the Senate in session through part of August to process those nominees if a deal with the Democrats cannot be reached.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A conservative watchdog group that began investigating former President Joe Biden's use of the autopen long before any congressional investigations started is furious over a lack of transparency and what it says are officials stonewalling information requests at the Justice Department.

The Oversight Project, which sued the DOJ in May over stalled Freedom of Information Act requests, says the Biden-era scandal is now being compounded by foot-dragging from the very administration that promised historic openness. The group is seeking internal legal guidance from the DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel concerning Biden's controversial use of the autopen to execute pardons. But after more than four months, it says the government is still resisting compliance with the FOIA requests despite granting expedited processing.

“We're over 130 days in on a request that goes to the heart of what the president himself has called the biggest scandal in American history,” said Kyle Brosnan, chief counsel for the Oversight Project. “And the Justice Department is slow-walking the release of this information. It's unacceptable given the gravity of what we're asking for.”

In response to growing scrutiny over his predecessor's use of the autopen, President Donald Trump ordered the White House counsel and the DOJ in June to investigate whether Biden's staff unconstitutionally exercised executive authority during Biden's final year in office. But Brosnan said Trump's own DOJ, led by Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, is stonewalling the release of necessary records for the watchdog's research project.

“From the top down, this administration talks a big game on transparency, but nobody's walking the walk,” Brosnan said. “President Trump deserves credit for being visible and accessible to the press, but the DOJ is not following his lead — especially not in this case.”

The Oversight Project's request focuses on whether DOJ lawyers under the Biden administration previously warned Biden that presidential powers, such as the pardon clause, cannot be delegated and require personal execution. In a recent interview, Biden admitted his staff had used the autopen for blanket clemency decisions based on the president's preapproved categories but that he did not give the green light for each person on the clemency list.

“If you have an OLC opinion saying, ‘Hey, Mr. President, you need to sign these things,' and he didn't, that throws additional fuel onto the fire,” Brosnan said. “We're asking for documents that may show the president ignored binding legal advice.”

Despite Brosnan's concerns, a federal judge this week approved the DOJ's request to postpone its next FOIA update until September. Brosnan said the delay contradicts Trump's push for aggressive transparency in government.

While the reason for the delay is not entirely clear, the Justice Department, now led by Bondi, has pointed to an overwhelming spike in FOIA activity. The agency's recent reports have suggested that standards are changing to address historic backlogs from previous years.

According to its 2025 Chief FOIA Officer Report, the department processed a record-breaking 157,180 requests in fiscal 2024, up from just 82,868 two years earlier, while reducing its backlog by more than 50%.

Still, critics say the numbers don't tell the whole story. Brosnan argues that the autopen-related FOIA request is relatively narrow and manageable yet is being treated like a political inconvenience.

Sam Dewey, a lawyer involved in a separate FOIA case over records tied to Hunter Biden's prosecution, echoed the sentiment. “We got some stuff recently,” Dewey told the Washington Examiner. “But it should have been released over a year ago,” he said, adding that the process has been “very frustrating.”

Mike Howell, the Oversight Project's president, submitted testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this year summarizing the broader transparency breakdown.

“Growing backlogs, agency failures to make timely determinations, arbitrary denials of requests, and excessive invocation of FOIA exemptions has made the government less transparent. … The average American, by and large, has been cut out,” Howell said.

The group expanded its criticism on X last week, writing, “133 days is enough” time for the DOJ to deliver responsive records.

“For reasons we cannot explain, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche are covering up records related to the Autopen Scandal. … The American people need to know who the president was,” the group wrote in its statement.

Scrutiny of Biden's use of the autopen gained traction in April after research by the watchdog group, formerly part of the Heritage Foundation, uncovered evidence that Biden relied on the mechanized signature printer for several executive orders and last-minute clemency actions. This prompted speculation about whether Biden made the final call on those decisions.

After Republican lawmakers began investigating Biden's autopen in early May, a July 13 report from the New York Times revealed that Biden staffers, including chief of staff Jeff Zients, used the device to carry out sweeping clemency grants under Biden's name. 

The Oversight Project believes that such action violates the Constitution's requirement that the president personally exercise certain “non-delegable” powers, prompting its search for additional records about what legal advice the president received about his autopen usage.

A casualty of Trump's purge speaks out.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Michael Feinberg had not been planning to leave the FBI. But on May 31, he received a phone call from his boss asking him about a personal friendship with a former FBI agent who was known for criticizing President Donald Trump. Feinberg, an assistant special agent in charge at the FBI's field office in Norfolk, Virginia, realized right away that he was in the crosshairs of the bureau's leadership at an unusually chaotic time. If his 15-year career at the bureau was coming to an end, he wanted to depart with at least some dignity rather than being marched out the door. By the following afternoon, he had resigned.

The FBI has long seen itself as an organization built on expertise. Its founder, J. Edgar Hoover, was an early and devoted advocate of professionalizing the government bureaucracy, to the point of mandating that agents wear a dark suit and striped tie. Now, however, the bureau is in the early stages of something like a radical deprofessionalization. The most important quality for an FBI official to have now appears to be not competence but loyalty. The exiling of Feinberg and others like him is an effort to engineer and accelerate this transformation.

Feinberg's boss, Special Agent in Charge Dominique Evans, didn't allege any misconduct on his part, Feinberg told me. Rather, as Feinberg set out in his resignation letter the following day, Evans explained that FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino had found out that Feinberg had maintained a friendship with the former counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok, a longtime target of Trump's ire. During Trump's first term, Strzok was fired from the FBI—and became a recurring target of Fox News segments—after the Justice Department released text messages in which he'd disparaged the president. Trump has repeatedly attacked him over his work on the bureau's 2016 investigation into Russian election interference (a topic of renewed interest for the president these days).

The association between Feinberg and Strzok was enough for the bureau to cancel a potential promotion for Feinberg, he told me. Evans, Feinberg said, suggested that he might face demotion, and that he would soon have to take a polygraph test about his friendship with Strzok. He quit instead. (The FBI declined to comment on what it characterized as a personnel matter; when I reached out to Norfolk in hopes of speaking with Evans, the field office declined to comment as well.)

Listen: The wrecking of the FBI

In his resignation letter, Feinberg lamented the “decay” of the FBI. “I recount those events more in sorrow than in anger,” he wrote. “I love my country and our Constitution with a fervor that mere language will not allow me to articulate, and it pains me that my profession will no longer entail being their servant.” Since leaving the federal workforce, he has decided to speak out—because, he told me, agents still at the bureau who fear retribution asked him to. Feinberg is now planning to spend time writing about these issues while he—like many other government employees forced out by this administration—figures out what to do next. In a recently published essay, he argued that the FBI has become obsessed with “ideological purity and the ceaseless politicization of the workforce,” which “makes us all less safe.”

Feinberg's background is not that of an anti-Trump crusader. He was vice president of the Federalist Society chapter at Northwestern Law School, from which he graduated in 2004, and considers himself a conservative; today, he often uses the work of the conservative political philosopher Edmund Burke as a conversational reference point in discussions of politics. He joined the FBI in 2009, he told me, because he saw it as the “best vehicle” through which he could help “protect both United States interests in the world and the rule of law on the domestic front.” When he and I first met, sometime around the beginning of the first Trump administration, Feinberg was working on counterintelligence investigations against China. Such was his commitment to the job that he refused on principle to go visit the giant pandas loaned by the Chinese government to the National Zoo.

Feinberg once trained as both a gymnast and a boxer, and still carries himself with a scrupulous economy of motion. He didn't talk about the details of his job much, but we turned out to share an interest in film noir and indie rock, subjects he approached with the same focus and intensity that he applied to matters of national security. I came to consider him a friend. At that point, he was already struggling to understand a conservative movement that seemed to have abandoned many of the principles that had attracted him in the first place.

Trump, in his second term, has intensified his efforts to transform ostensibly apolitical institutions into tools of his own personal power. This is a dangerous strategy in whatever form it takes: Eating away at government expertise, whether at the National Weather Service or the Food and Drug Administration, places lives at risk. But Trump's personalist approach is particularly dangerous when applied to the agencies that can detain, prosecute, and imprison people. In a recent conversation, Feinberg recalled the sociologist Max Weber's famous definition of the state as the entity with a monopoly on the legitimate use of force. “Organizations like the FBI are the tool by which that force is exerted,” he said. “So you need them to be politically pure.” Otherwise, the risk grows that the government's violence will be brought down on people who are disfavored by those in power.

The FBI does not have an impeccable track record in this area. In addition to his focus on technocratic institution-building, Hoover left behind an unsettled legacy of paranoia and bureaucratic power politics as well as a willingness to harass political enemies, from which the bureau has never quite managed to disentangle itself. Former FBI Director James Comey kept on his desk Hoover's approved application to wiretap Martin Luther King Jr., which the bureau planned to use as part of a campaign to drive the civil-rights leader to suicide—a reminder, Comey said, of what happens when those in power “lack constraint and oversight.” Since Hoover's death, the FBI has built up thickets of procedures in an effort to avoid precisely this kind of political targeting.

Yet an FBI without constraint or apolitical oversight is exactly what Trump wants, and what Bongino and FBI Director Kash Patel seem to be working toward. Trump launched his 2024 campaign by declaring to his supporters, “I am your retribution,” and in their previous lives as MAGA influencers, both Patel and Bongino voiced support for locking up the president's opponents. Citing “Justice Department sources,” Fox News recently reported that the FBI has opened a criminal investigation into former intelligence chiefs who led the government's assessment of Russian election interference in 2016.

In the first Trump administration, such a blatant use of the FBI for political ends would have been an unthinkable breach of law-enforcement independence. But the FBI's new leadership has been pushing out many of those who might object. So many people have been driven away, in fact, that after his departure, Feinberg found himself adopted by what he calls an “exile community” of former Justice Department and FBI officials working to help one another adjust to post-government life. Many have found support in the organization Justice Connection, founded by a longtime Justice Department lawyer to provide support for employees leaving the department.

“The sad thing,” Feinberg told me, is that these exiles began their government careers “with the purest and noblest of intentions.” They're exactly the kind of public servants you'd want steadying the tiller at a time like this, and therefore exactly the people whom Patel and Bongino sought to be rid of. Others who have so far escaped notice are counting down the days until they can retire. Feinberg worries about how this attrition will affect the FBI's culture going forward. He worries about the dwindling number of FBI agents with solid values who are still trying to hang on. Without old hands around to voice principled objections, “newer and younger employees are going to become acculturated to a politicized bureau,” he told me. “That will seem normal to them.”

New agents will also arrive at a bureau much more directed toward prioritizing immigration arrests. Feinberg spent the first few months of the second Trump administration as his office's acting head, struggling to manage resources after agents were pulled into assisting with ICE roundups. In one instance, Feinberg became aware of a request from an FBI agent to purchase face coverings. Anxiety was building among agents over rumors of immigration officials being filmed and doxxed on social media, and ICE employees had begun hiding their identities. Now it seemed that FBI agents in Norfolk wanted to follow ICE's lead.

“I was absolutely furious,” Feinberg told me. “We live in a democracy. We are an organization that serves the public. We do not hide from our actions.” He conferred with others in the office's leadership, and they agreed to quietly prohibit office funds from being spent on masks.

Brandon del Pozo: Take off the mask, ICE

As we spoke, Feinberg emphasized that he didn't necessarily object to the FBI being involved in immigration enforcement. Every president, he said, gets to choose how to direct the bureau's priorities. The problem is the way the Trump administration has chosen to use the FBI: taking agents trained for complex investigations and having them stand around looking scary while ICE conducts immigration arrests. This overlap of the FBI and ICE not only wastes resources, but actively undermines the bureau's ability to investigate the very gangs that Patel and Bongino have said they want to tackle. Why, after all, would any Latin American immigrant agree to cooperate with the FBI on taking down MS-13 or Tren de Aragua, if reaching out to law enforcement might well get them deported?

There is also the question of what leads won't be pursued because of this focus on immigration—and because the FBI's leadership has pushed out the experts who knew how to do such work in the first place. Feinberg, who speaks Mandarin, helped spearhead the FBI's investigation into the Chinese technology giant Huawei, which the U.S. accused of stealing trade secrets from American companies. Now that he's gone, he's not sure whether anyone working in counterintelligence at senior levels of the bureau knows Chinese. “It's particularly concerning to me, as someone who dedicated his professional career to combating the Chinese Communist Party and all of its tentacles, to see resources and efforts diverted away from hostile foreign intelligence services and other serious threats to the homeland to focus on minor immigration status offenses,” Feinberg wrote in his recent essay.

Earlier this month, Patel and Bongino found themselves tied up in the ever-widening Jeffrey Epstein scandal: Having hinted to the MAGA faithful at damning revelations only to come up empty-handed, they're now struggling to explain themselves. When I asked Feinberg about this, he sounded more exasperated than anything. “They get a kick out of playing dress-up and acting tough,” he said. “But they actually have no idea what they're doing.”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Israel's far right wants to take over Gaza. Netanyahu wants to stay in power.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

When Benjamin Netanyahu returned to power in 2022 after a brief period of political exile, he did so on the backs of the most extreme allies in Israeli history. Fourteen of his coalition's 64 seats were held by parties led by two explicitly anti-Arab lawmakers: Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich. Ben-Gvir had been charged and convicted of support for terrorism and racist incitement. He was a disciple of Meir Kahane, a rabbi who called for the expulsion of Israel's Arabs and whose political party was banned from Parliament for its radicalism. Smotrich had advocated segregating Jews and Arabs in Israeli maternity wards and told his Arab colleagues in the Knesset that they were “enemies” who were “here by mistake.”

Both Ben-Gvir and Smotrich expressed sympathy for violent settler attacks in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Both sought to annex the West Bank and disenfranchise or expel the Palestinians living there. And both became ministers in Netanyahu's new government, because the Israeli leader desperately needed their support.

The math was simple: The parties in Netanyahu's coalition received just 48.4 percent of the vote and attained a parliamentary majority only through a quirk of the Israeli electoral system. This meant that Netanyahu entered office in a profoundly precarious position—on trial for corruption and beholden to extremists who could bring him down if he bucked their demands.

Recognizing how bad this arrangement looked from the outside, Netanyahu embarked on an international PR campaign to assure outsiders that he, not the extremists, was running the show. “They are joining me,” he told NPR. “I'm not joining them.” The trajectory of the war in Gaza has conclusively disproved this spin. At crucial junctures, the prime minister's choices have been corrupted by the need to cater to those with the ability to end his grip on power. As a result, he has undermined Israel's war effort and shredded the country's international standing abroad. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the events that precipitated the Gaza hunger crisis.

Israel was faced with a dilemma after Hamas butchered some 1,200 Israelis and took hundreds more hostage. The United Nations Relief Works Agency was the only actor capable of delivering humanitarian aid to the civilians of Gaza during the ensuing war, but UNRWA was compromised by Hamas, which siphoned supplies for itself and sold them at a markup to fund its operations. Although the extent of this co-option is disputed, the fact of it cannot be denied. Employees of the organization were among the perpetrators of the October 7 atrocities, as even the UN itself has acknowledged; hostages have testified that they were held by UNRWA staff or in UNRWA facilities. “All aid goes down”—that is, underground to Hamas—and “does not reach the nation,” an elderly Palestinian woman told Al Jazeera in December 2023. “Everything goes to their houses. They take it, they will even shoot me and do whatever they want to me, Hamas.”

Hamas has obscured its subversion of aid by intimidating aid workers, civilians, and media outlets. In the early days of the war, the terrorist group reportedly looted fuel and medical supplies from UNRWA's headquarters in Gaza City. The aid organization initially disclosed this on social media but then deleted the post. It had good reason to worry. More than a decade ago, a senior UNRWA officer in Gaza attempted to investigate whether any of the organization's local employees were moonlighting with Hamas. He received a funeral bouquet in the mail, and later a live grenade, at which point he was evacuated from the territory. According to The New York Times, Matthias Schmale, the head of UNRWA in Gaza from 2017 to 2021, gave a TV interview that upset Hamas; he was pushed out of his position after the group “informed UNRWA that it could no longer guarantee his security.”

“Would I be totally surprised if at the end of the day there is proof that 2,000 UNRWA staff are members of Hamas?” Schmale told the paper. “No, I wouldn't be,” though “it would be a bit shocking if it is such a high number.”

Faced with this predicament, as well as pressure from the Biden administration to allow more aid, Israel had several credible options for providing humanitarian assistance. Starting on day one of its ground invasion, the army could have begun building a new aid mechanism for Gaza's civilians by setting up non-UNRWA distribution centers, in conjunction with local and international partners, in each area where it assumed control. Or Israel could simply have flooded the enclave with so much aid that Hamas would not be able to resell it for significant value. This latter option had the downside of inevitably funneling food and fuel to Hamas in its tunnels, perversely bolstering the group's fight against the country supplying it. But realistically speaking, there was no way to starve Hamas out of its well-stocked underground fortress without first starving the desperate Gazan civilian population, which, as ever, served as the group's human shield.

Israel chose neither of these options. Instead, it allowed UNRWA to continue limited operations, while repeatedly tightening and relaxing restrictions in response to complaints about the diversion of aid. Israel then agreed to surge supplies into the territory during the 42-day cease-fire in January—only to completely blockade all aid for two months afterward. Finally, with Gaza on the brink, Israel and the United States launched the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation in May, attempting at last to displace UNRWA. This effort to implement an entirely new system on the fly, under the worst possible conditions, unsurprisingly failed. Both Israeli troops and Hamas killed Palestinians trying to reach the distribution sites, and food prices in Gaza skyrocketed, culminating in the crisis we see today.

Read: No rational aid-distribution system should work this way

Israel's choices here are contradictory and do not make moral or strategic sense. But they do make political sense from Netanyahu's perspective. Since the start of the war, the prime minister has contended with pressures from opposing directions: from international partners insisting that he sustain Gaza's civilians and from the right flank of his coalition, which seeks to ethnically cleanse those civilians and repopulate the area with Jewish settlements. Ben-Gvir and Smotrich have explicitly called for the “voluntary migration” of the area's Palestinian population and advocated ending humanitarian aid as a lever to achieve it. “The only way to win the war and bring back the hostages is to completely stop the ‘humanitarian' aid, conquer the entire Gaza Strip, and encourage voluntary migration,” Ben-Gvir declared on Saturday on social media.

To keep this faction in check—and keep himself in power—Netanyahu needed to ensure that the choices he made could satisfy not just military imperatives or international diktats but also the hard right's demands. Every step he authorized had to be dual use: ostensibly for a strategic purpose but also capable of potentially advancing the far right's plan. In practice, pursuing these two goals at the same time is incompatible with a just and successfully prosecuted war: It is impossible to provide aid and also withhold it, to pursue a limited war against Hamas to free hostages and also a war of conquest.

The longer the conflict has gone on, the more obvious the compromised nature of Netanyahu's decision making has become. Initially, the Israeli leader was restrained by pressure from the Biden administration (which pushed for more aid and compelled Netanyahu to reject Gazan displacement), Defense Minister Yoav Gallant (who insisted that Gaza be returned to Palestinian governance), and the centrist wartime-coalition partner Benny Gantz (who advocated for a cease-fire). But Gantz left the coalition in June 2024, Joe Biden was replaced by Donald Trump in November, Netanyahu fired Gallant the day Trump won, and then Trump himself proposed relocating the Gazan population in order to construct a “Riviera in the Middle East.”

The result: Today, the only pressure on Netanyahu is from the far right, which is effectively running his war policy against the desires of a large majority of Israelis who oppose settlements in Gaza and support a hostage deal to end the war.

This bleak reality and its consequences explain the growing alienation of many of even Israel's strongest international allies. After October 7, Israel's partners may have thought they were interfacing with a typical—if deeply conservative—Israeli government. Now they actually seem to be dealing with a Smotrich/Ben-Gvir government in a Netanyahu-shaped trench coat. Belatedly, a group of European countries, as well as Britain, Australia, and Canada, are attempting—without American assistance—to reimpose the pressures that might compel Netanyahu to change course.

Hamas has agency in all this. It chose to launch the October 7 attack knowing that it would provoke a devastating response; it chooses to hold hostages in underground dungeons under inhumane conditions; it chooses to hide within and beneath Gaza's civilians; it chooses to appropriate aid intended for those civilians to fuel its messianic war machine. Israel also faces prejudice and unfair expectations that would not be faced by many other countries in such circumstances. But Netanyahu has agency in how he chooses to respond to these realities. He has made his choice—and Palestinians and Israelis will continue to pay the price for it until he makes a different one.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The U.S. Department of Education used to employ people whose job was to stop waste, fraud, and abuse. Now almost all of their desks are empty.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

In March 2019, a team of investigators from the U.S. Department of Education's fraud-prevention team arrived at a Houston trade school for what was supposed to be a routine inspection. Several of the students the team wanted to interview, however, were nowhere to be found. At the end of a long and frustrating day, the investigators headed back to their car. That's when two of the missing students appeared in the parking lot. They wanted to talk in a place where school administrators couldn't overhear them.

That conversation led to the unraveling of a years-long scheme designed to steal from the American taxpayer. The trade school, called the Professional Career Training Institute, had been recruiting homeless people from a local nonprofit. Many were high-school dropouts, some of them functionally illiterate with histories of petty crime and drug abuse. Enroll in college, they were told, and we'll pay your rent while federal grants take care of tuition, books, and all the rest. The school fabricated diplomas from an unaccredited, possibly nonexistent high school, then set up federal financial-aid accounts and passwords for the students before secretly taking out large loans on their behalf.

Colleges collectively receive more than $140 billion in federal student aid every year. At the beginning of this year, the Department of Education employed about 220 people to make sure that money actually went toward paying for students to attend legitimate educational institutions. But no such investigations are being conducted today. That's because, in March, the newly confirmed secretary of education, Linda McMahon, fired more than 80 percent of the fraud-prevention and quality-assurance team, according to an official who was involved in many fraud causes, and who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. The move was one part of a massive series of layoffs that cut employment at the department by nearly 50 percent compared with the beginning of the year—all in service of President Donald Trump's directive to shut down a federal agency that was created by an act of Congress in 1979. This month, the Supreme Court ruled, without explanation, that those layoffs could go into effect while a lawsuit challenging them works through the courts.

Read: The Supreme Court won't explain itself

The Trump administration has justified its dismantling of the federal government under the banner of cutting “waste, fraud, and abuse.” The cuts to the Department of Education's anti-fraud team are likely to have exactly the opposite effect. For every dollar the government spends investigating frauds like the Houston student-loan scheme, it saves more in the form of recovered funds and prevented crime. Trump promised to trim the federal bureaucracy. In this case, he has instead defunded the police.

Even before the latest layoffs, the Department of Education employed the fewest workers of any Cabinet-level agency. Because education is mostly funded and regulated by state and local governments, the department's role has historically been limited, but still important. Among other things, it administers the $1.7 trillion federal-student-loan portfolio and distributes $31 billion in Pell Grants to low-income college students every year.

The point of federal student loans is to give students access to credit that they can't get in the private market. Unlike the requirements for, say, a mortgage, people don't need to have financial assets or a job to borrow for college. On top of loans, Pell Grants are available to anyone from a family of modest means. The system helps people earn degrees when they otherwise can't afford to. It also makes higher education vulnerable to fraud. Without any regulations, I could hang a sign on my door that says Kevin Carey University, charge tuition equal to the value of a Pell Grant, scrawl diploma on a napkin, and split the proceeds with my “students.”

To prevent such behavior, Congress wrote specific provisions into the federal Higher Education Act, defining the terms under which colleges can receive tuition paid with federal aid. Before students enroll in college, they must graduate from high school or pass the GED. Colleges must be approved by an independent accrediting body that sets standards for quality. They have to sign a legal agreement with the Education Department that lays out additional conditions, and submit annual financial statements to certify that they're not about to go bankrupt and leave students out to dry mid-semester.

These are not especially rigorous standards. The Education Department has little say in what colleges teach or whether they do a good job teaching it. In the same way local health departments enforce food-safety standards but allow restaurants to sell flavorless burgers and soggy fries if the market demands them, the goal is a minimum level of consumer protection in an otherwise open market.

Even that standard requires enforcement. Investigators first visited the Professional Career Training Institute, the Houston trade school, during a routine inspection. After getting tipped off by the students in the parking lot and being contacted by an internal whistleblower who had a video recording of diplomas being forged, they returned with a bigger team of lawyers and accountants.

Many students learned during interviews with Education Department inspectors that they owed tens of thousands of dollars in student loans. A federal accountant discovered two sets of books: a fake one that the school showed students, which didn't include their hidden loan balances, and a real set of financial records, which did. One student tried to enroll in a different college, only to learn that PCTI had already applied for and received her aid money for the upcoming year.

News of the inspection set off a panic inside PCTI. The school's leaders got to work doctoring records and coaching students to lie. PCTI's founder and CEO, Carrie Poole—feted by a local marketing company as one of the “top 30 most influential women in Houston” in 2014—personally handed one student a check for $910 as payment for her to stay home on the day of the inspection and not “rat her out,” according to the Education Department. Confronted with these and other allegations, PCTI claimed that much of the testimony from students with criminal records was unreliable. These were, of course, students whom the school had gone out of its way to recruit. (This account is drawn from Department of Education documents, including records from administrative proceedings. Poole did not respond to requests for comment.)

When it came to federal regulations, PCTI lied about seemingly everything. School officials pretended that married students were single so their household income would drop and they would receive more need-based aid. The school inflated the number of hours students were taught. Attendance records were falsified, instructors went missing, and necessary equipment never arrived.

Colleges accused of malfeasance are legally required to receive due process. PCTI lawyered up and mounted a vigorous defense. After hearings before an administrative-law judge and an appeal, the college was officially stripped of eligibility for federal financial aid in December 2021.

PCTI is not an isolated case. In 2005, fraud inspectors caught a large mid-Atlantic trade school that, according to the department, sold students laptops at a 125 percent markup and handed out credentials in “surgical technology” to a student whose real-world training consisted of working for two weeks in a hospital storage room. A student studying phlebotomy testified that “the practice arms were so filled with holes that the fake blood would spurt out when students attempted to practice their sticks.”

In another case, a Florida woman created an independent “sports academy” that, according to fraud investigators, sold young men on the false promise of being recruited by Division I schools. Upon arriving, students and their parents were pressured into taking out federal loans to enroll in a barbering-and-cosmetology program. According to the government, the school falsely claimed that the football players were studying cosmetology for 10 to 12 hours a day, including on weekends. (One student at that school was allegedly told to do something like “curl your hair, take a video, and turn it in.”) The owner received more than $800,000 in federal-loan disbursements before the Education Department shut her down. From 2021 to August 2024, the department sanctioned 85 colleges, levied $61.7 million in fines for misconduct, and cut off 35 schools from receiving federal financial aid.

When Trump took office in January, the Education Department's quality-assurance team was organized into five groups. One processed requests from new colleges to become eligible for federal student aid and recertified existing colleges on a six-year schedule. Another group conducted yearly audits, and a third made sure that schools were financially healthy and complying with rules designed to crack down on predatory for-profit colleges. A group of 10 regional offices conducted site visits and program reviews like the one that uncovered the PCTI scheme. A special fraud-investigation unit focused on the worst actors. All of these activities were mandated and funded by Congress.

Annie Lowrey: A real cancer in Washington

As soon as Linda McMahon was confirmed as education secretary, most of the team was fired. Add in DOGE-induced retirements, and the headcount went down from about 220 to fewer than 40. The fraud-investigations unit is gone. Eight of the 10 regional offices have been closed. The financial-analysis group is no more. Most of the lawyers who prosecuted cases were also let go or reassigned to other tasks. The only thing the remaining skeleton crew can do is rubber-stamp paperwork to keep federal dollars flowing.

This is incredibly frustrating for the public servants who have made safeguarding the higher-education system their life's work. The official who helped enforce fraud cases told me, “The team doing this work put a lot of bad schools out of business. I feel good about it.” The department, they noted, had recovered tens of millions of dollars from fraudulent colleges. With the system now defenseless against criminality, they say, the message to would-be scammers is “Back up your truck to the ATM machine.”

Ellen Keast, the deputy press secretary at the Department of Education, told me in an email that staff “continue to carry out all of their roles and responsibilities under law, including clearing the backlog of nearly two thousand program reviews, program certifications, and other oversight activities neglected by the Biden administration because it was too distracted by their loan bailouts and politically motivated witch hunts targeting career- and faith-based institutions.” She did not, however, elaborate on how the department is managing to execute its obligations without employing the human beings who would actually perform them. Indeed, in granting an injunction suspending the layoffs, a federal judge found that by eliminating “entire offices and programs,” McMahon had “made it effectively impossible for the Department to carry out its statutorily mandated functions.”

The Supreme Court later stayed that injunction, allowing the layoffs to go into effect as the case moves forward. Even if the lawsuit eventually succeeds and the administration is forced to rehire the fraud investigators, it's hard to imagine the McMahon regime aggressively enforcing the law. The Trump higher-education agenda is far more focused on persecuting elite research universities. The dismantling of the fraud-enforcement unit is the Trump approach to governance in microcosm: chaotic, seemingly illegal, and the reverse of what someone who truly cared about protecting taxpayer money would do. It's now open season on students who are susceptible to false promises about college—something that the president, whose Trump University real-estate-seminar business paid a $25 million settlement to former students, knows a great deal about.

The layoffs have come as the Trump administration has begun executing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Notably, the law does not abolish the U.S. Department of Education. In fact, it includes new provisions that the department will have to implement. It allows students, for the first time, to use their Pell Grants to pay for job-training courses as short as eight weeks, start to finish. These kinds of classes, which tend to get advertised at bus stops and on late-night basic cable, have already been rife with abuse. Extending Pell Grant eligibility for them now, after terminating the people in charge of preventing that abuse, is all but guaranteed to have ugly results.

The law also penalizes colleges that offer programs whose graduates don't earn much in the job market. This is a reasonable idea that could force reputable colleges and universities to take more responsibility for the quality and price of their offerings. But the provision doesn't apply to undergraduate certificate programs, whose graduates are 10 times more likely to fall beneath the earnings threshold. And it will require teams of data analysts and lawyers to implement—that is, exactly the people whom McMahon just fired.

Meanwhile, the people who make a living off of unsuspecting college students are lying in wait. Carrie Poole has rebranded PCTI as the “Agri-Tech eLearning Institute,” whose slick website touts its “impressive and strong history spanning over a decade.” The website includes extensive information about federal student-aid programs that students legally cannot use to attend Agri-Tech (a disclaimer on another page notes that “Agri-Tech eLearning Institute does not offer or participate in federal financial-aid programs”), and invites people to “unlock a better future today.” (Agri-Tech did not respond to requests for comment.)

The institution has adapted, and is showing new signs of resilience.

“There is zero statistical advantage” to getting married if you are a man in America today, Andrew Tate argued in a viral 2022 video on “why modern men don't want marriage.” Women, he believes, are worthless anchors—“They want you monogamous so that your testosterone level drops,” he posted on X last fall—and your marriage is likely to end in ruin anyway. “If you use your mind, if you use your head instead of your heart, and you look at the advantages to getting married,” there are none.

The loudest voice in the manosphere is infamous for many things, including criminal charges of human trafficking, rape, and assault. (Tate has denied these charges.) But he is also notorious for launching a new front in the culture wars over marriage, aimed mostly at teenage boys and young men.

Tate believes that men no longer receive the deference they deserve from women in marriage, and bear more risk in divorce. He argues that men should focus on getting strong, making lots of money, and using—but not investing themselves in—the opposite sex. His evident appeal—clips of Tate garner hundreds of millions of impressions on YouTube and TikTok—would seem to be yet one more sign that our oldest social institution is in trouble.

Brad Wilcox: The awfulness of elite hypocrisy on marriage

Critics on the left have been questioning the value of the institution for much longer, albeit from a different angle and with less venom than Tate. The realities of marriage in recent decades no doubt provide fuel for several varieties of criticism. Before divorce became widely permissible in the 1970s, difficult marriages—and even dangerous ones, for women—were by no means rare. Many women's career dreams were thwarted by the demands of marriage, and some still are today. Many men have been hit hard financially and sidelined from their children's lives by divorce. Innumerable children of divorce have had their faith in marriage extinguished by their parents' inability to get along (a pattern that may help explain Tate's animus toward the institution; his parents divorced when he was a child).

Some of these dynamics are both a cause and a consequence of the great family revolution of the late 20th century—one in which divorce and single parenthood surged. The share of prime-age adults (25 to 55) who were married fell from 83 percent in 1960 to 57 percent in 2010, according to census data, and the share of children born to unmarried parents rose from 5 to 41 percent.

These trends have left Americans bearish about marriage. Until 2022, the share of prime-age adults who were married was still on a long, slow downward march. According to a 2023 Pew Research Center survey, a plurality of men and women were “pessimistic about the institution of marriage and the family.”

From the October 1997 issue: Can the government prevent divorce?

But reports of marriage's demise are exaggerated. Rather quietly, the post-'60s family revolution appears to have ended. Divorce is down and the share of children in two-parent families is up. Marriage as a social institution is showing new strength—even among groups that drifted away from the institution in the 20th century, including Black and working-class Americans. And contrary to criticisms on the left and right, that's good news not only for America's kids, but also—on average, though not always—for married men and women today.

“If the ongoing revolution in family and gender arrangements is largely irreversible,” the progressive family historian Stephanie Coontz said in an address to the National Council on Family Relations in 2013, “then we have to recognize divorced families, single-parent families, and married-couple families are all here to stay.”

At the time of her talk, the divorce rate was about twice as high as it had been in 1960, though it had come down somewhat from its 1981 peak. Nonmarital childbearing, meanwhile, had recently climbed to a record high. But even as Coontz spoke, two important shifts in family dynamics were under way.

First, the decline in the divorce rate was accelerating. Since the early 1980s, the divorce rate has now fallen by almost 40 percent—and about half of that decline has happened in just the past 15 years. (Unless otherwise noted, all figures in this article are the result of my analysis of national data.) The idea that marriage will end in failure half the time or more—well entrenched in many American minds—is out-of-date. The proportion of first marriages expected to end in divorce has fallen to about 40 percent in recent years.

Second, nonmarital childbearing, after almost half a century of increase, stalled out in 2009 at 41 percent, ticking down to about 40 percent a few years later, where it has remained. For children, less divorce and a small decline in childbearing outside wedlock mean more stability. After falling for more than 40 years beginning in the late 1960s, the share of children living in married families bottomed out at 64 percent in 2012 before rising to 66 percent in 2024, according to the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey. And the share of children raised in an intact married family for the duration of their childhood has climbed from a low point of 52 percent in 2014 to 54 percent in 2024.

A third shift may now be under way as well, although it is much less established than the first two. The rate of new marriages among prime-age adults, which hit a nadir during the pandemic, has risen in each of the three years of data since 2020. In 2023, the most recent year available, it was higher than in any year since 2008. At least some of this increase is a post-pandemic bounce, but the share of all prime-age adults who are married has also leveled off in the past few years, which suggests that the decades-long decline in the proportion of Americans who are married may have reached its low point.

Listen: The new divide in American marriage

Some of these shifts are modest. Coontz was surely right that couples and families in the U.S. will continue to live in a variety of arrangements. And particular caution is warranted as to the number of new marriages—it is quite possible that the longer trend toward fewer people marrying will reassert itself. But as a likely success story for those who do wed, and as an anchor for American family life, marriage looks like it's coming back. Stable marriage is a norm again, and the way that most people rear the rising generation.

The Harvard anthropologist Joseph Henrich has observed that “marriage represents the keystone institution for most—though not all—societies and may be the most primeval of human institutions.” On every continent and in every era, in more patriarchal societies and more egalitarian ones, it has governed family relationships. As an institution, it seems to build on the “evolutionary psychology of both men and women,” writes Nicholas Christakis, a sociologist at Yale, which “is to exchange love for support.”

The institution's record contains no shortage of injustices. In many times and places, marriage has been bound up with the oppression of women. (This article focuses mostly on heterosexual marriages, because marriage was not legal for same-sex couples until very recently.) Still, given the long history of marriage's persistence, its recent resilience in the U.S. should not be shocking. Nor should the reasons for that resilience. As it has before, marriage in the U.S. is adapting to changing circumstances and expectations. It is different now from the institution that looked so troubled in the late 1960s and the '70s.

One notable example is family care. Most marriages in the United States today are not throwbacks to the '50s when it comes to domestic responsibilities; husbands are more willing to lean in. The amount of time that American fathers spend on child care increased from 2.5 hours a week in 1965 to nine hours in 2024, according to Pew and the American Time Use Survey. Over this same period, the share of time spent on child care by dads rose from 25 to 62 percent of what moms provided.

Indeed, one reason the United States' birth rate may be higher than those of East Asian countries such as Japan and South Korea—where the fertility rate has fallen to 1.15 and 0.75 babies per woman, respectively, well below the U.S. rate of 1.6—is that men in those countries do much less child care and household labor than men in the U.S. Even as women around the world embrace the “egalitarian frontier,” in the words of the social scientist Alice Evans, men in some cultures have maintained their old habits. “As a result,” Evans writes, “the sexes drift apart.” This may help explain why South Korea has seen marriages tank and its fertility rate fall to the lowest in the world.

There is no single model for a good marriage in the U.S. today, and most couples have their struggles. Men still do less child care and housework, and disagreements over the division of household labor are a source of tension for some couples. Many women still value some traditional traits in men, such as breadwinning, and some men's unreliability as breadwinners is a source of strain for them and their wives. A 2016 study on divorce published in the American Sociological Review found that when a husband was not employed full-time, his risk of divorce shot up by 33 percent the following year; when a wife was unemployed, her odds of divorce did not change. Employment difficulties among less-educated men are a big reason marriage rates are lower among the working class than among college graduates.

Olga Khazan: Why it's so hard to get so many men to do more housework

But on the whole, marriage confers benefits to women and men alike. According to the 2024 General Social Survey, married men and women ages 25 to 55 are more than twice as likely to be “very happy” with their life as their nonmarried peers. Married people—men and women both—live longer, are more financially secure, and build more wealth than single Americans.

In 2022, I worked with YouGov to survey some 2,000 married men and women, asking about their overall marital happiness and how they'd rate their spouse on a range of indicators. The happiest wives in the survey were those who gave their husbands good marks for fairness in the marriage, being attentive to them, providing, and being protective (that is, making them feel safe, physically and otherwise). Specifically, 81 percent of wives age 55 or younger who gave their husbands high marks on at least three of these qualities were very happily married, compared with just 25 percent of wives who gave them high marks on two or fewer. And, in part because most wives were reasonably happy with the job their husband was doing on at least three out of four of these fronts, most wives were very happy with their husband, according to our survey. In fact, we found that more than two-thirds of wives in this age group—and husbands, too—were very happy with their marriage overall.

I believe it's important for teen boys and young men to hear the entirety of this message. Marriage changes men, but not in the nefarious ways Andrew Tate might think. Men work harder and find more success at work after they get married; they drink less as well. And marriage can channel noble characteristics and behaviors that have classically been identified with masculinity: protection, provision, ambition, stoicism. That's good for both men and women—and can help young men identify and work toward a model of prosocial masculinity that diverges from the one being peddled by manosphere influencers such as Tate.

Marriage's comeback is good news for society: Children raised in two-parent homes are much more likely to graduate from college than those raised in other families, and less likely to be incarcerated. Kids who don't live with both of their married parents are far more likely to be depressed than those raised in intact families. After surveying the research on child well-being, the economist Melissa Kearney concluded that the “evidence is clear, even if the punchline is uncomfortable: children are more likely to thrive—behaviorally and academically, and ultimately in the labor market and adult life—if they grow up with the advantages of a two-parent home.” Her view reflects the mainstream academic consensus on family structure and children today.

Melissa Kearney: A driver of inequality that not enough people are talking about

But marriage's comeback is, of course, incomplete. Although the trend may be starting to reverse, the share of all Americans who get married has fallen significantly since the '60s, and there is abundant evidence that many young adults today are reluctant to marry, or are having trouble finding partners they want to marry. In particular, marriage has become more selective over time socioeconomically. A majority of college-educated Americans ages 25 to 55 (62 percent) are married, versus a minority of less-educated Americans (49 percent), according to the 2023 American Community Survey. This bifurcation did not exist half a century ago and is one reason marriages are more durable today: Money makes everything easier.

The plight of working-class men in the labor force is worth underlining here. Among prime-age men, the less educated are nearly twice as likely not to be employed full-time as those with a college degree. And as working-class men's connection to the labor force has frayed, so too has their connection to the ties that bind. If, as a society, we want more adults to see their way into a lasting and happy marriage, then we would do well to focus on helping these men find their way to good jobs first.

But the idea that successful marriages are attainable only by certain groups today is misguided. Since 2012, divorce rates have been falling for working-class Americans and Black Americans, too—and the share of kids being raised in married families for these two groups has stabilized. (In fact, the proportion of Black children being raised in a married-parent family rose from 33 percent in 2012 to 39 percent in 2024.) And across both class and racial lines, marriage is linked to greater happiness, household earnings, and wealth for women and men.

Derek Thompson: America's ‘marriage material' shortage

In the past, American society has readily advocated for behaviors that can improve lives and reduce social problems—campaigns against smoking and teen pregnancy are two examples. We should at a minimum strive to ensure that young people have an accurate understanding of marriage today, not one that's outdated—and certainly not one supplied by cranks and zealots.

Marriage is not for everyone—of course it isn't. But men and women who are flying solo—without a spouse—typically report their lives to be less meaningful and more lonely. The share of unmarried men ages 25 to 55 who say they are unhappy in the General Social Survey more than doubled from the late 1990s to the 2020s. That fact alone highlights just how wrong Andrew Tate is about men and marriage.

Bill Pulte started with viral cash giveaways, public family feuding, and meme stocks. Now he's targeting Jerome Powell and Adam Schiff.

The Trump administration's loudest attack dog of late holds an unlikely position: director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.

The FHFA's 37-year old director, Bill Pulte, has been pounding the drums to get Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell fired. He's publicly pressured Powell on social media, he gave Trump a draft letter that would have ordered Powell's firing, and he's tried to establish a pretext Trump could use to fire Powell.

But Pulte has also played a broader role in Trump's retribution campaign. He's used his position to try and get two of Trump's Democratic enemies — Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and New York Attorney General Letitia James — prosecuted for mortgage fraud.

Some of his allies hope this is just the start, and that even bigger things lie in Pulte's future. “Bill Pulte would be an exceptional pick to run the Federal Reserve,” venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya posted on X last week.

“Attack dog” is an unusual role for the director of the FHFA, who is charged with overseeing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac — the government-backed companies crucial to the functioning of US mortgage markets. (Vox requested comment from Pulte through the FHFA for this story, but received no response.)

The email you need to stay informed about Trump — without letting the news take over your life.

But it's a good fit for Pulte. The grandson of the founder of a major home-building company, Pulte has demonstrated a remarkable knack for getting attention and building his public profile. He has 3 million followers on X, and his posts there have started to move markets, according to Bloomberg.

Pulte has his enemies in the administration; the Wall Street Journal recently reported his anti-Powell campaign has “irritated” some senior officials.

One person is quite happy with him, though. After that Journal story was published, Trump posted that Pulte was doing an “outstanding job,” and added: “KEEP MOVING FORWARD, WILLIAM, DON'T LET THE RADICAL LEFT WEAKLINGS STOP YOU!”

Housing is the Pulte family business. Pulte's grandfather, also named Bill, founded what eventually became one of the largest home-building companies in the US, PulteGroup. The younger Bill was barely done with college when, in 2011, he founded a Michigan-based private equity fund focused on the housing industry. The board included such local luminaries such as Rick DeVos (son of future Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos) and Scott Romney (brother of Mitt Romney).

Grandpa Pulte died in 2018. The following year, then-31-year-old Bill got his first taste of national fame by going viral for giving people money. Pulte gave or offered to give sometimes hundreds of dollars, sometimes thousands or even tens of thousands, and he posted on Twitter about it. He called this “Twitter Philanthropy.” (He insisted he was not giving away his inheritance money, but rather money he'd independently made.)

Some of the giveaways were for people posting stories about why they needed help, others were purely random — but the common thread was that, if you wanted a shot at the cash, you needed to follow or retweet him on Twitter. (Following him was necessary so he could send you a direct message if you won, he explained.) In July 2019, Pulte said he'd give $30,000 to “a veteran on Twitter” if President Trump retweeted him, and the president did so.

All this proved highly successful at increasing Pulte's Twitter following, which rose from the low tens of thousands to 2 million in early 2020. But his relationship with the company his grandfather founded deteriorated. He lost his seat on PulteGroup's board of directors, after the board unanimously voted not to renominate him.

With the novelty of Twitter Philanthropy worn off, Pulte found a new focus for his self-promotion: the meme stock craze.

In 2021, an online community championed the cause of buying GameStop stock, foiling Wall Street short-sellers betting against the ailing company by instead sending its share price “to the moon.” Some of these retail buyers became devoted fans of Gamestop's CEO, Ryan Cohen, and followed him on to other investments, like the big stake he took in the home goods company Bed Bath & Beyond. This did not go well; $BBBY's share price tanked, the company went into bankruptcy, and many shareholders were wiped out.

As Rolling Stone has reported, Pulte became a supporting character in this saga. He tried to cultivate Cohen's fans and brand himself as a cool, meme-friendly finance influencer, adopting “Only the Young” as a motivational catchphrase and his intro music. He appeared on Twitter Spaces and streaming shows, and even co-hosted an in-person event in Florida (at $500 a ticket).

Pulte particularly cultivated the beleaguered Bed Bath & Beyond investors, many of whom hoped this wealthy and successful philanthropist would somehow find a way to get them back the money they'd lost. In January 2024, Pulte released a statement saying the “Pulte family” would purchase Bed Bath & Beyond bonds so they could “demand answers” for wiped-out retail shareholders.

The Pulte Family Charitable Foundation, which he is not involved with, wanted to be excluded from this narrative, and released a statement distancing themselves from him. Pulte fired back with an X post calling his aunt, Nancy Pulte Rickard, who heads the foundation, “a fake representative of the Pulte Family.” He added that his aunt “is angry she wasn't in my grandpa's will when I, the namesake, was in the will.”

As it became clear that there would be no miraculous recovery for $BBBY shareholders, Pulte amassed his share of dedicated online haters, who mocked him as “Ploot” and chronicled what they saw as his strange behavior on subreddits like /r/GME_meltdown. These haters would soon watch agog as Pulte, who they viewed as a “fraud and weirdo,” suddenly scored a powerful position in the federal government. This, one Redditor wrote, was “an absolutely wild plot twist.”

Through all this time, Pulte's public persona hadn't been particularly political. But he figured out a good way to gain entry into Trumpworld — by, again, giving people money. He gave $500,000 to a pro-Trump Super PAC in 2022. He'd also donated to Turning Point USA, the young conservatives' group co-founded by Charlie Kirk. (Kirk is a close ally of Donald Trump Jr.)

After Trump won in November 2024, the New York Post floated Pulte as a potential Housing and Urban Development secretary, quoting a “source” calling him “probably overqualified” and stressing those past donations to vouch for his loyalty to Trumpworld.

Trump nominated him for FHFA director instead, and before his confirmation hearings, he deleted tens of thousands of his old tweets, to Senate Democrats' annoyance. Shortly after he was confirmed in March, Pulte posted on X: “You didn't really think I'd stop tweeting did you”.

The FHFA job is a consequential one. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed under government conservatorship during the 2008 financial crisis, but the Trump team is now planning to reprivatize them. It is unclear how involved Pulte is in these discussions (one report claimed he'd been “largely cut out”).

Pulte has, however, been quite quick to use his position to go after Trump's enemies — specifically, James, the New York attorney general, and Sen. Schiff, who have for years been leading figures in Democrat-led investigations of Trump.

In April, Pulte wrote a letter to the Justice Department referring James for prosecution, arguing she lied on mortgage documents. In May, Pulte did the same thing with Schiff — news that became public earlier this month, when Trump posted about it.

Pulte took public credit for the Schiff investigation, posting on X: “Fannie Mae's Financial Crimes Division concluded that Mr. Schiff has engaged in a sustained pattern of possible Mortgage Fraud.” A confidential Fannie Mae memo alleging misconduct by Schiff — a memo addressed to Pulte — was provided to the Washington Post earlier this month.

Both Schiff and James have denied any wrongdoing and said they are being targeted politically, and it remains to be seen whether DOJ will charge them. Federal prosecutors pursuing complex corruption cases against public officials have long found the mortgage fraud statute to be a useful tool — it's relatively easy to prove, and it carries a steep, 30-year maximum sentence. (According to David Simon, federal prosecutors in Baltimore called it the “Head Shot.”) But it's not yet clear whether they have enough to make and sustain either case.

With Powell having earned Trump's ire for his reluctance to lower interest rates, Pulte started going after him, too. For the past two months, he's been publicly criticizing the Fed chair and urging him to resign.

Since the law only permits Trump to fire Powell “for cause” — meaning “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office” — Pulte has been laying the groundwork for that. He's been arguing that the expensive renovation of the Fed's headquarters is a “scandal” that merits Powell's firing for misconduct.

“I remain optimistic Jerome Powell will do the right thing, and as early as next week,” Pulte posted Friday on X.

Could Trump be considering replacing Powell with Pulte himself? So far, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett is said to be the frontrunner. And a Pulte nomination may not be received kindly by the Senate or the markets.

But maybe Pulte can post his way into the job. After all, social media has gotten him this far.

Banning food dye is inconsequential when environmental pollution is killing us.

On a Friday evening this July, the Trump administration announced it would lay off all of the health research scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency. Hundreds of investigators who try to understand how toxic pollution affects the human body would be gone.

That wasn't a surprise. The EPA — which had a founding mission to protect “the air we breathe and the water we drink,” as President Richard Nixon put it — has been busy dismantling policies that are in place to ensure environmental and public health.

The New York Times reported earlier this month that the agency is drafting a plan that would repeal its recognition of climate change as a threat to human health, potentially limiting the government's ability to regulate greenhouse gases. EPA administrator Lee Zeldin has relaxed existing standards for mercury and lead pollution — two toxins that can lead to developmental problems in children. And the EPA has postponed its implementation of new Biden-era regulations that were supposed to reduce the amount of dangerous chemicals Americans are exposed to.

Meanwhile, House Republicans are attempting to grant widespread liability relief to pesticide companies and restrict EPA regulation of PFAS “forever chemicals” through provisions that have been tucked into the spending bills currently moving through Congress. (Democrats, for their part, have offered opposing legislation that would protect an individual's right to sue over any harm from pesticides.)

This collective assault upon America's environmental regulations targets not just the environment, but human health as well. Which means it sits oddly with the work of another Trump official whose office at the Department of Health and Human Safety is just a 15-minute walk from EPA headquarters: Robert F. Kennedy Jr, whose Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement seeks to, obviously, make Americans healthier.

But Kennedy hasn't spoken up about these contradictions — and his supporters are beginning to notice.

In response to the pro-pesticide industry proposals in Congress, MAHA leaders wrote a letter to Kennedy and Zeldin voicing opposition to a bill that they believe “would ensure that Americans have no power to prevent pesticide exposure, and no path to justice after harm occurs.” In the letter, they also urged the EPA to ban two pesticides — atrazine and glyphosate — that have been linked to birth defects and liver and kidney problems.

“These toxic substances are in our food, rain, air, and water, and most disturbingly, in our children's bodies,” the MAHA letter says. “It is time to take a firm stand.”

Kennedy is no stranger to these issues: Earlier this year, the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again Commission report, which sought to document and explain the dramatic increase in chronic diseases like obesity among US children, identified both chemicals as health risks. Zeldin, however, has been working to deregulate both atrazine and glyphosate in his first few months leading the EPA.

“It is completely contrary to MAHA to relax regulations on PFAS and many different chemicals. We are calling upon them and to reverse some of these actions that [the administration] is taking or seemingly may allow,” said Zen Honeycutt, one of the letter signers and the founder of the MAHA-aligned group Moms Across America. “We are extremely disappointed with some of the actions taken by this administration to protect the polluters and the pesticide companies.”

MAHA burst onto the political scene as part of Kennedy's 2024 presidential campaign. It has become a vehicle for public health concerns, some exceedingly mainstream (like addressing America's ultra-processed food and reducing pollution) and some of them very much outside of it (such as undermining the effectiveness of vaccines). After dropping his own candidacy, Kennedy joined forces with Trump, and ended up running the nation's most important health agency.

But now that he's in office, he and the movement he leads are running into the challenges of making change — and the unavoidable reality that MAHA has allied with a president and an agenda that is often in direct opposition to their own.

“In the case of Lee Zeldin, you have someone who's doing incredibly consequential actions and is indifferent to the impact on public health,” said Jeremy Symons, senior adviser to the Environmental Protection Network and a former adviser to the EPA during the Clinton administration. “In the case of Kennedy, you have someone that has spent his life thinking about public health, but seems unable or disinterested in stopping what's going on.”

Kennedy has successfully nabbed voluntary industry commitments to phase out certain dyes from American food products. He has overhauled the government's vaccine policy, and one state has already followed his lead in banning fluoride from its drinking water. But his ambitions to reduce the sheer number of toxins that leach into America's children in their most vulnerable years are being stymied by an EPA and a Republican-controlled Congress with very different priorities.

“Food dyes are not as consequential as pesticides for food manufacturers. The ingredients they put into the food contaminate the food,” Honeycutt said. “That issue is a much larger issue. That is the farmers, and changing farming practices takes longer.”

To Kennedy's credit, these are issues he'd apparently like to tackle — if he could. His HHS report earlier this year pointed out that “studies have raised concerns about possible links between some of these products and adverse health outcomes, especially in children.” Specific ingredients in pesticides have been associated with cancer, inflammation, metabolic problems and more. But the EPA, meanwhile, has reversed regulations and stymied research for those same substances.

The EPA has proposed easing restrictions on the amount of the herbicide atrazine that can be permitted in the nation's lakes and streams. Human and animal studies have associated exposure to atrazine with birth defects, kidney and liver diseases, and problems with metabolism; the evidence, however, remains limited and the MAHA report called for further independent research. The EPA has also moved to block states from putting any new limits on or requiring any public disclosures for glyphosate, a herbicide that the MAHA report says has been linked to a wide range of health problems. Zeldin also postponed Biden-era plans to take action on chlorpyrifos, a common insecticide increasingly associated with development problems in kids.

The EPA has also been slow to move on microplastics and PFAS, both substances of growing concern among scientists and the general public. These invisible but omnipresent chemicals are a priority for the MAHA movement, singled out in the White House report for further study and policymaking. The EPA, though, has delayed implementing a new standard to limit PFAS in drinking water and announced it would consider whether to raise the limits of acceptable PFAS levels in community water systems, while also slashing funding for more research on the substance's health effects.

Bisphenols (also known as BPA) and phthalates are two other common materials used in plastic production and food packaging, which have also been identified by researchers as likely dangerous because of their ability to disrupt hormone and reproductive function. The MAHA singles them out for further study and possible restrictions, but the EPA has delayed safety studies for both.

The US is even moving backward on pollutants like mercury and lead, for which the scientific evidence of their harms is undisputed. They are toxins that regulators have actually taken steps over the decades to reduce exposure, through banning the use of lead paint, strictly limiting mercury levels, etc. Yet over the past few months, the EPA has moved to grant exemptions to coal power plants and chemical manufacturers that would allow more mercury pollution, while cutting monitoring for lead exposures.

This is a long list of apparent contradictions and we're barely six months into Trump's term. How long can the contradictions pile up without Kennedy challenging Zeldin directly?

We reached out to the Health and Human Services Department to see if we could get Kennedy's perspective on any of this. In response, an agency spokesperson sent a written statement: “Secretary Kennedy and HHS are committed to investigating any potential root causes of the chronic disease epidemic, including environmental factors and toxic chemicals,” an HHS spokesperson wrote. “The Secretary continues to engage with federal partners, including the EPA, to ensure that federal actions align with the latest gold standard science and the public health priorities identified in the MAHA report.”

But as the EPA continues to roll back environmental protections despite the reassurances that the administration is aligned on MAHA, Kennedy's constituents are growing impatient.

“Our children's lives and futures are non-negotiables, and claims from the industry of ‘safe' levels of exposure ignore the impacts of cumulative exposure and the reality of serious, evidence-backed risks,” the MAHA movement's recent letter says. “The industry's call for delay or inaction is completely unacceptable — immediate and decisive action is needed now and is long overdue.”

The conflict between the two agencies' agendas has been striking: The EPA, under Zeldin, is allied with the industries it regulates and plans to deregulate as much as possible. HHS, on the other hand, is focused on its vision of making the environment safer in order to improve people's health — a goal that will inevitably require more regulations that require companies to restrict their use of certain compounds that prove to be dangerous to human health.

Trump himself has said the two sides are going to have to work together and figure things out, Honeycutt noted — words that she is taking to heart for now. And the movement's leaders recognize that they are now in the business not of outside agitation but of working within the system to try to change it. “We're not always going to be happy,” Honeycutt said.

But Kennedy may be playing the weaker hand: Zeldin and his agency hold obvious advantages, and in a fight between HHS and EPA, EPA will likely win — unless, perhaps, Trump himself steps in.

The biggest reason is a matter of authority: The EPA has the responsibility to regulate pollution, while Kennedy's HHS does not. The federal health agency can offer funding to state and local health departments to advance its policy goals, but it has effectively no regulatory authority when it comes to the dangerous substances identified in the MAHA report's section on chemical toxins. The EPA, on the other hand, has broad discretion to regulate the chemicals that industries pump into the American environment — or not.

The difference between the leadership at the two agencies is also stark: Kennedy is a former lifelong Democrat who has never held a government position; Zeldin is a seasoned GOP operator who served four terms in the US House. Kennedy has brought in an assortment of unconventional personnel at HHS, many with skepticism about mainstream science and who are viewed dubiously by the industries they oversee. At the EPA, representatives of long-entrenched polluting interests have commandeered powerful positions: Nancy Beck, a former scientist at the American Chemistry Council, the chemical manufacturing industry's trade association, for example, is now holding the position overseeing chemical safety and pollution prevention.

The perception within the industry, according to insiders who spoke with Vox, is that Kennedy is, well, a lightweight.

“From the perspective of the polluter takeover of EPA, Kennedy is largely seen as inconsequential and ineffective. He's playing wiffle ball,” Symons said. “Kennedy talks a good game, but watch carefully what's happening at EPA and all the favors being given to corporate polluters that are going to do far more damage than anything.”

“The food we eat, the water we drink, and the air we breathe are going to get more toxic and more dangerous because of what's happening in EPA,” Symons told Vox.

When it comes to jockeying for influence, Zeldin also enjoys more powerful friends in the Republican Party. He has relationships with conservative politicians and advocacy groups across the nation. Almost all of the Republican state attorneys general, for example, are motivated to roll back environmental regulations because it's compatible with their priorities in their respective states.

“A lot of this is being driven by polluter states, red states with Republican attorneys general,” Symons said.

And, as evidenced by the pesticide liability relief legislation in Congress that prompted MAHA's letter to Kennedy and Zeldin, Republicans in the House and Senate remain much more allied with corporate interests — an alliance that has stood for decades — than with the public health movement that has only recently been brought inside the broader Make America Great Again coalition.

It is a bitter irony for a movement that has often called out corporate influence and corruption for the government's failures to protect public health.

The White House's own MAHA report cites the influence of big businesses to explain why the chronic disease crisis has grown so dire; in particular, the report says, “as a result of this influence, the regulatory environment surrounding the chemical industry may reflect a consideration of its interests.”

MAHA's leaders aren't running for the hills yet; Honeycutt said she urges her members not to vilify Kennedy or Trump for failing to make progress on certain issues. But they sense they're losing control of the agenda on the environment, forcing difficult questions onto the movement just a few months after it attained serious power in Washington.

“As for MAHA organizations, they must decide whether they are to become appendages of the Republican party, or coalesce into an effective, independent political force,” Charles Eisenstein, a wellness author who was a senior adviser to Kennedy's presidential campaign, wrote for Children's Health Defense, a once-fringe group with ties to Kennedy. “To do that, the movement must hold Republicans accountable for undermining public health with policies like liability shields. It must not sacrifice its core priorities to curry short-term favor with the Republican establishment.”

The MAHA-MAGA political alliance is new and tenuous — many MAHA followers voted for President Barack Obama, Eisenstein points out — and it may not be permanent.

And some fractures are already apparent: Honeycutt, the leader of Moms Across America and a signer of the MAHA movement's letter to Kennedy, told Vox that her own members have told her directly that they are considering voting for Democrats in the next election. Even as she urges MAHA to keep the faith, Honeycutt said that Republicans risk alienating this enthusiastic part of their coalition by going hog wild on environmental deregulation. Her group is in the process of pulling together a legislative scorecard to hold lawmakers to account.

“There could be dire consequences for the midterm elections, if they don't realize,” she said. “We don't care if you're a Republican or Democrat. We will support whoever supports us.”

A Vox reporter explains what's going on with the GOP's early redistricting plans.

We're more than a year out from the 2026 midterm elections, but the Republican Party is already starting to position itself for what will likely be a difficult election cycle.

Texas lawmakers have an unusual plan to redraw their maps early and eke out as many as five more likely Republican seats in the House of Representatives — and California Gov. Gavin Newsom is promising to respond by doing the same thing in California.

To find out more, I asked my colleague Christian Paz, who wrote about these efforts last week. We sat down to chat about his reporting for Vox's daily newsletter, Today, Explained, and our conversation is below. You can also sign up for the newsletter here for more conversations like this.

What are Republicans trying to do ahead of the 2026 midterms? 

Ahead of the 2026 midterms, when parties in power tend to lose seats in Congress, there is an expectation that Trump, who has a tiny two-seat majority in the House, could lose that majority, which would effectively render him a lame duck for the second half of his second term. In response, Trump has been pushing for Texas state Republicans to take advantage of the fact that the legislature in Texas controls redistricting and to redraw the maps in Texas in the middle of the decade, when it is not usually the norm.

Republicans could gain about five seats that are less competitive than the current map makes it out to be — essentially dividing up Democratic districts, mixing them with some Republican-leaning voters, and carving out five more seats that presumably Republicans would then win and be able to keep their majority in the House.

Are there other states looking to do this, too?

There are a handful of other states. At the moment, there is redistricting happening in Ohio as a result of court challenges in the past, and the new maps that are being redrawn would render about three more Republican seats out of Ohio. The other state is Missouri, which would render one more Republican seat.

In response, the question has been, Can Democrats do this, too? The reason this is happening is because these are states where 1) Republicans have total control of government, and 2) the legislature still has power over drawing maps, or there are legal quirks requiring redistricting. Democrats are much more limited on this front because of the states that have Democratic trifectas, the majority of them don't give the power to redraw districts to the legislature. They give it to independent commissions or to bipartisan commissions, or their constitutions have stricter bans on redistricting early.

Understand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.

With that being said, Gavin Newsom is threatening to add more Democratic seats in California. How does he want to make that happen?

His plan is a little vague. A lot of the Democratic response seems to be a form of mutually assured destruction — the main idea here is to say that you're going to do the same thing and hope to scare Republicans out of doing this. And the idea Gavin Newsom has proposed is putting a measure on the ballot in an upcoming election, having a statewide referendum to either approve new maps or permanently change the way that the state does its redistricting.

The idea there is to create five to seven more Democratic seats in California, which seems like a pretty tall order. It's possible that the state is already pretty maxed out.

Can Democrats conceivably wring enough seats out of their redistrictable states to match the GOP?

The other obvious seats that are out there are states like Oregon, Washington, and Colorado, which conceivably could all produce one to two more Democratic seats. There's always New York, too, and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who met with Democratic state lawmakers from Texas last week, has said that he's open to the idea as well.

Republicans seem to be all in for this plan. Democrats aren't so sure. Tell me about that.

The issue here is that Democrats, because they have tended to be the folks who argued against gerrymandering and this kind of politically motivated redistricting, acknowledge that it's not normal to do this. They acknowledge that maybe the rules are changing, but redistricting opens them up to charges of hypocrisy or descending to the same level as Republicans.

But many Democrats are saying, you know, We're running out of options. Democratic voters want us to do something. That's been the rallying cry from the party base to party leadership over the last year, and this is a pretty substantive plan to do that. But then what happens in the next five years? What happens in 10 years? Is this just going to become something that states do whenever they notice that their national party is in danger of losing a majority or losing a political advantage? Does that then diminish trust in the political system as a whole? Does that raise even more questions about accountability and transparency that were the point of trying to have independent redistricting to begin with?

In previous midterms, you've seen much bigger swings than five or even 10 seats, so it's very possible that this shaves the margins for Republicans, but doesn't end up swinging control of the House in 2026, right? 

Yes. This could either be another 2018 “blue wave” situation, where even if Republicans redistrict, they would lose the majority anyway. Or it could be a 2022-style midterm, where you have mixed results — Democrats are able to flip some Senate seats, but Republicans are actually able to uphold or expand their House majority by small margins.

And the reason I bring that last point up is because this is another point that some critics on both sides are making. By trying to gerrymander things even more, you're making assumptions about what voters you have in your column, and given how much various parts of the electorate have swung…Black and Latino voters have swung toward the Republicans. Could they be swinging away from them this time around? Are you making an assumption as a Republican that you have a lot of a certain kind of voter, and then making a district slightly less safe because you're trying to shovel voters into a new district that you're creating?

It creates questions about same effect in California: If you try to max out even more districts, are you accidentally making some of your other districts more competitive than they have to be, and in that case, will you end up having to spend even more money and resources on races that weren't competitive before, but now are because you're trying to marginally make another seat less competitive?

There's a lot of inherent assumptions being made about what the electorate will look like next year. And again, one thing that's really easy to forget — and this is true for the parties, too, and I haven't really seen this discussed — is that in the Trump era, you have two different electorates. You have different electorates that turn out in midterms versus general elections. Sometimes it can be drastically different and much more Democratically aligned than you expect, and that ends up leading to overperformance, like in 2018 or 2022.

So there is a different question, right? If you make certain seats more Republican by packing voters in there, what happens when the voters you assume would be voting for you don't come out to vote? It could really backfire.

The hormone might be the key to understanding this moment in America.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who oversees the US Department of Health and Human Services, has supported the debunked ideas that vaccines cause autism and that organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have helped cover up the link. He's skeptical of the chemicals in our foods and skies, and worries that we've veered too far from all that is good and natural. Yet for all this, he admits to taking testosterone regularly as part of his “anti-aging protocol from my doctor.” In April, in an interview with Fox News' Jesse Watters, the septuagenarian began to lament the testosterone levels of our youth. “A teenager today, an American teenager, has less testosterone than a 68-year-old man,” he claimed. When Watters expressed disbelief, he doubled down, saying that testosterone levels have dropped as much as 50 percent from “historic levels.”

It's not clear exactly what “historic levels” he was referencing— or, for that matter, what, if any, research he was citing. It's possible that he was misinterpreting the results of a 2007 study that analyzed data gathered from adult men from the 1980s onward and observed a 1 percent decline in average testosterone levels per year (meaning that a 68-year-old man in 1997 would have had 10 percent more testosterone than a 68-year-old man in 2007). The study, however, said nothing about how teenage or young adult testosterone compared. Still, the Fox News clip made its rounds online. On platforms like X, users reshared the video and parroted Kennedy's unsubstantiated claim, voicing suspicions of an intentional campaign to weaken the nation and sounding well-worn dog whistles. “Mass poisoning mass murder mass replacement,” read one post responding to the video. Questions of scientific literacy aside, it was clear that Kennedy had struck a chord.

Testosterone is having a moment. Within the sweaty halls of the gym bro internet, the trend of testmaxxing has gathered steam, with countless videos dedicated to how someone might “naturally” (and not so naturally) increase their testosterone levels by, say, eating nearly a dozen eggs a day or simply getting on testosterone replacement therapy. The supplements hawked by alt-right podcasters like Alex Jones are often studded with possibilities of “[supporting] normal testosterone levels in men.” Famously, in 2016, Trump paraded his testosterone levels in his presidential bid against Hillary Clinton. And lest we think obsession with testosterone is restricted to the echo chambers of the manosphere, we should bear in mind that the physique idealized in mainstream Hollywood wouldn't be possible without artificially elevated levels of it, as Alex Abad-Santos previously observed for Vox.

The same move that supposedly identified the chemical makeup of masculinity revealed just how unstable it was.

We live in strange times, surrounded by positions that can seem like contradictions: Our HHS secretary doesn't believe in vaccines, but takes a hormone regularly; the Republican Party works tirelessly to limit access to the substance for people seeking gender-affirming care while simultaneously gutting the federal agency responsible for regulating testosterone in our farming industries (which employs it to increase the “efficiency by which [the animals] convert the feed they eat into meat”). Meanwhile, evangelical leaders condemn trans people for existing, while also platforming doctors telling post-menopausal women to take testosterone so they might get back their curves.

In many ways, testosterone sits at the crossroads of the tensions cutting through our culture today. By paying close attention to the history of the hormone and the often paradoxical roles it is made to play, we can better understand the forces shaping modern life.

Ask most people what testosterone is, and you'll probably hear that it's the “male hormone.” In fact, type that very phrase into Google and all search roads will tend to lead back to T. The two are considered so interchangeably that they often function as synonyms: testosterone as the chemical essence of masculinity, masculinity as the product of testosterone.

Online, this line of reasoning gets pushed to its limits. In one TikTok with more than half a million views as of this writing, a user boldly claims that “Low testosterone is the cause of 99 percent of all male problems. When a transgender woman wants to feel like a man, she takes testosterone. Why? Because testosterone is what makes you feel like a man.” With testosterone comes all the characteristics and advantages ascribed to men: strength, mental acuity, competitiveness. Just last year, Elon Musk responded to a post on X featuring a 4Chan screenshot that argued that “women and low T men” weren't fit for leadership because they would naturally defer to consensus beliefs, compared to “high T alphamales” who were capable of objectively assessing a situation. “Interesting observation,” replied the world's richest man.

Despite the ubiquity and weight testosterone holds today, it's a relatively new entrant in our understanding of the body. In Testo Junkie, Spanish philosopher Paul B. Preciado explains that for most of Western history before the 17th century, sex was understood by a logic of similarity and inferiority.

“Female sexual anatomy was set up as a weak, internalized, degenerate variation of the only sex that possessed an ontological existence, the male,” he writes, citing the scholar Thomas Laqueur. You might call this the Eve-as-Adam's-rib model of sex. Women weren't seen as a distinct category, separate from men in their own right, as much as they were considered a “worse” version of men.

Then, at the dawn of the modern era, a new approach began to emerge. We started to create discrete categories that we might fit the world into, purifying it of ambiguity and hybridity: nature versus culture, animal versus human. Sex was no exception, and an oppositional, binary understanding of man versus woman emerged. Women and men were placed in entirely separate categories, overturning the previous understanding of women as imperfect men.

Sex assignment became hyper-focused not so much on the complex web of social roles, anatomy, temperament, and reproductive capacities that organized identity previously, but on easily observable, “mechanical” features like the shape and size of one's genitals. As Laqueur points out, organs like the ovary, which didn't even have a “name of its own” for millennia (since it was often referred to by the same word used for male testes), became no less than a “syn­ecdoche for woman” during this time.

These categories were “not only natural but even transcendental,” in Preciado's words. Or as Ben Shapiro likes to phrase it, “facts don't care about your feelings.” Today, you can still see this system hard at work whenever a troll uses a hashtag like #WeCanAlwaysTell to discredit someone's gender identity. Of course, the supposed facts didn't always line up quite so neatly with reality itself — as was the case with intersex people who challenge this paradigm — but doctors conveniently solved for this by creating sub-classifications like “female pseudo-hermaphrodites” that still preserved the “truly male,” “truly female” binary.

Testosterone didn't properly enter the scene until 1935. That was the year that three independent teams of researchers, each backed by a different pharmaceutical company, identified and synthesized it.

There was only one catch: The long-awaited “male hormone” didn't fit quite so neatly into the binaries that organized our understanding of the body. Research uncovered that hormones weren't exclusive to one sex. Everyone had testosterone, even if average rates tended to differ between traditional sex lines. It turns out that before menopause, women produce three times as much testosterone as estrogen. In fact, contrary to popular opinion, testosterone isn't the “opposite” of estrogen, it's the precursor — men and women convert testosterone into estrogen using the enzyme aromatase, and higher levels of testosterone in men can actually result in higher levels of estrogen.

The same move that supposedly identified the chemical makeup of masculinity revealed just how unstable it was. It was born as a paradox, the double-edged essence of manhood that never was.

These tensions haunt testosterone today. On the one hand, we still largely think about sex in terms of binaries, and of testosterone as the chemical distillate of a natural and inviolable maleness. At the very extremes, testosterone has been used to violently enforce old hierarchies. In the '40s, Nazis transplanted testosterone glands into gay men's penises in a brutal attempt at conversion therapy.

On the other hand, it doesn't take much to sense the unease that the fluidity of testosterone has opened us up to. If maleness or femaleness were once something you unassailably possessed at birth based on unchanging physical markers and roles, then the presence of testosterone across sexes — alongside the development of other chemical interventions that disrupted traditionally sexed functions like the Pill — contributed to the growing awareness that these categories aren't given as much as they are produced.

Critically, these scientific developments happened against the backdrop of broader social movements that sought to challenge the core ideas underpinning patriarchy. As second-wave feminists critiqued the idea of a “natural” order where men ruled, and women were integrated into more spheres of economic and social life, traditional notions of masculinity began to lose their grip.

Testosterone lives between these two slowly colliding cultural tectonic plates. The desire to compare T-levels — whether it's between “low T men” and “high T alphamales” or teenagers and 68-year-olds — ultimately boils down to the desire to lament the state of masculinity today while simultaneously legitimizing the reality of “maleness” by pinning it on some objective and measurable metric.

In short, testosterone has become a way that men can not only ground their masculinity in a moment when our ideas of gender are more fluid than ever, but even quantify it — all while borrowing the veneer of scientific legitimacy to feel assured in their manliness.

It's this tension that lets conservative mouthpieces insist on the “immutable biological reality of sex,” as one Trumpian executive order phrased it, while simultaneously making a profit by selling supplements that claim to enhance testosterone levels (and by extension your manhood). This doublethink is on full display whenever a product like Force Factor's Test X180 Legend advertises itself with lines like, “Let's be honest: being a man is relatively straightforward. … Biologically, to achieve this goal you want more testosterone and less estrogen – maximizing your masculinity.”

Major pharmaceutical companies are competing over the growing testosterone replacement therapy market, which is set to break $2 billion in the next few years. In the same ways that marketers for Listerine generated demand for mouthwash in the 1920s by popularizing “halitosis” (or bad breath) as a medical and treatable condition, testosterone has become positioned as a salve for the supposed crisis of masculinity today. Masculinity is now both something straightforwardly given at birth, but also always needing to be maximized through consumable supplements, a commodified “biotech industrial artifact” as Preciado provocatively calls it.

Of course, this commodity isn't available to everyone. The desire to preserve traditional boundaries also helps us understand the restrictions that have been historically applied to the hormone. One of the reasons that testosterone therapy failed to gain larger traction in the 1940s after its synthesis was that physicians were worried about its effects on women, including vocal change and hair growth.

Even today, although the Food and Drug Administration has approved 31 different testosterone products for men (not to mention the many products it has approved for livestock), it hasn't greenlit a single product for women out of this fear, despite studies that indicate that testosterone could offer women a range of benefits from breast protection to osteoporosis prevention. The hormone's male bias has impeded the kind of expansive testing needed for regulatory approval and created a host of misconceptions around its effects on women, even as interest in testosterone for women appears to have grown organically in recent years. It's not hard to imagine the commercial motivation to keep it this way either. Though women might represent an untapped market, offering testosterone to women could also result in what advertisers call “brand dilution,” or overextending a product to the point of undermining its value.

In his conversation with Jesse Watters, Kennedy attributed the decline in teenage testosterone levels to the quality of food being consumed today. “The food our kids are eating today is not really food, it's food-like substances,” he claims. He's not wrong. A recent study found that over half the calories consumed at home in the US come from ultra-processed foods, or “industrial formulations containing no or minimal whole foods and made entirely or mostly from substances extracted from foods.”

Like any medicine, it is both a poison and a cure depending on how it's used.

Our renewed interest in testosterone isn't just about the erosion of borders between gender classifications, but about the slowly crumbling walls separating us from the world we inhabit.

Around a century ago, hormones like testosterone upended our ideas about how the body communicates with itself — allowing us to see how organs could speak to each other using our bloodstreams. Now, as we discover that the world has worked its way into our bloodstreams in the form of microplastics and the “food-like substances” we ingest daily, it makes sense that this hormone would be caught up in these broader anxieties. As one user commented in the r/Testosterone subreddit, “hormones given to animals we eat, pollutants in the air and water, blue light from devices etc all contribute to lowering of hormone production.” High testosterone is seen as a sign of a healthy and self-regulating body, and concerns about declining hormone levels stand in for a broader concern that the natural balance in us has been disrupted by our environment.

At the heart of our fascinations and fears lies the growing awareness that our bodies are far more malleable and open to the world than we once thought, that our identities are far more unstable and fluid than assumed.

What remains to be seen is where we'll go from here. There are those that want to lean into this radically chemicalized body. Sports leagues like the Enhanced Games, endorsed by transhumanist types like Bryan Johnson, are experimenting with steroids and testosterone regimens in an attempt to “redefine superhumanity.” Meanwhile, Kennedy's use of testosterone despite his vaccine skepticism comes from the desire to preserve some delineation between what is natural and synthetic — to let in what is real (testosterone) and do away with what is artificial (vaccines). Many like Kennedy are unsettled by the idea that the borders of our bodies and identities are highly permeable, and taking testosterone is a way to try to get the body back to a “natural” state, before it was disrupted by the unnatural forces outside of us. This desire to use testosterone to protect the “natural” also runs through evangelicals who see it as a way for women to retain their femininity as they get older, as well as industrial farmers who use it to reinforce a natural order in which animals are treated chiefly as meat for human consumption.

There are no easy resolutions to this whirlwind of competing views. Yet by following testosterone through the twists and turns of its many roles, we end up with a better understanding of this moment. It is a chemical that sits between biology and culture and that is manufactured both by organic processes and human industry, which undermines the very categories that it produces. As we continue to figure out how to navigate our changing place in the world, testosterone can be used to reinforce the patterns of thinking that divide us or challenge our entrenched biases to evolve our understanding of each other and the environment we share. Like any medicine, it is both a poison and a cure depending on how it's used. It's up to us to decide what it'll be.

An AI chatbot is a pretty good interpreter. It can't dredge a river.

Microsoft researchers analyzed which careers are most and least likely to be affected by generative AI and large language models based on an anonymized dataset of 200,000 conversations between users in the United States and the tech giant's Copilot chatbot, formerly known as Bing Copilot.

They found that the jobs most likely to be affected involved those providing and communicating information, including translators, historians, and writers.

The researchers avoided the most pressing question about AI: the extent to which it will eliminate or even grow jobs in the workforce. Rival CEOs have disputed Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei's view that AI could wipe out up to half of white-collar entry-level jobs in the next five years. Others in tech, such as Mark Cuban, think AI will be a net job creator.

The paper doesn't cover whether interpreters and translators (the occupations they found that most overlapped with AI) should be fearful about their future. Likewise, the researchers didn't conclude that dredge operators (among the least affected occupations) were safe.

""Our research shows that AI supports many tasks, particularly those involving research, writing, and communication, but does not indicate it can fully perform any single occupation,"" Kiran Tomlinson, a senior researcher at Microsoft who's the lead author of the paper, said in a statement to Business Insider. ""As AI adoption accelerates, it's important that we continue to study and better understand its societal and economic impact.""

Based on the chatbot data, researchers could see what users were asking the AI to do and what the AI was performing in response. They could then compare these findings with the types of tasks that are most likely to overlap with an AI chatbot.

Their findings echo the growing research and views that AI chatbots will probably have a much greater overlap with office jobs than those requiring physical work or interactions. If this holds true, it means AI would change a different part of the workforce than past technological revolutions.

Among the least affected jobs were phlebotomists, nursing assistants, and hazardous materials removal workers.

This doesn't mean physical labor jobs aren't affected. The researchers also cautioned that their data concerns only large language models.

""Other applications of AI could certainly affect occupations involving operating and monitoring machinery, such as truck driving,"" they wrote.

Wesley LePatner, a star executive in Blackstone's real estate business, was among those killed on Monday by a gunman who entered the company's Park Avenue offices.

LePatner was the $1.2 trillion firm's global head of core+ real estate and CEO of Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, an evergreen real estate fund. Her death has left staff at the New York-based asset manager ""heartbroken,"" the private equity giant said in a statement Tuesday morning.

LePatner is one of four victims who lost their lives to the gunman, who has been identified by the police as Shane Tamura. The gunman died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound in the building.

""Words cannot express the devastation we feel. Wesley was a beloved member of the Blackstone family and will be sorely missed. She was brilliant, passionate, warm, generous, and deeply respected within our firm and beyond. She embodied the best of Blackstone,"" the statement continued.

LePatner, a Yale graduate and trustee of New York's Met Museum, was an executive at Goldman Sachs before joining Blackstone in 2014.

She told Business Insider in 2022 that her unit was, ""for all intents and purposes, a startup.""

""I faced all the challenges one could imagine when building a multibillion-dollar business — from hiring to ensuring standards remain high, moving quickly to keep up with growth, and staying ahead of market swings and growing pains,"" she said.

LePatner served on the board for the UJA-Federation of New York, which honored her at its Wall Street dinner in 2023. Blackstone's President Jon Gray presented her with the Alan C. Greenberg Young Leadership Award. He spoke about her ascent in finance and her support of women on Wall Street, saying ""she pays it forward from generation to generation.""

""Wesley was extraordinary in every way — personally, professionally, and philanthropically,"" the non-profit said in a statement. ""An exceptional leader in the financial world, she brought thoughtfulness, vision, and compassion to everything she did.""

She led a solidarity mission with UJA to Israel following the October 7 attack.

In her acceptance remarks, she talked about the organization's ""power to create a sense of community and belonging, and that ability to create a sense of community and belonging matters now more than ever.""LePartner is survived by her husband, Evan, and their two children.

""We cannot properly express the grief we feel upon the sudden and tragic loss of Wesley, the LePatner family said in a statement. ""She was the most loving wife, mother, daughter, sister, and relative, who enriched our lives in every way imaginable.

""To so many others, she was a beloved, fiercely loyal and caring friend, and a driven and extraordinarily talented professional and colleague.""

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told employees in an email early Tuesday morning that one of the league's employees was seriously injured in a Monday shooting at a Midtown Manhattan office tower.

""A gunman committed an unspeakable act of violence in our building at 345 Park Avenue,"" Goodell said. ""The employee is in stable condition and NFL staff are at the hospital supporting his family.""

The commissioner said the NFL believes all other employees are safe and accounted for.

The shooting, which was first reported at 6:30 p.m. Monday, was at 345 Park Avenue in New York, where several major businesses — including Blackstone, KPMG and the NFL — are located.

Police said 27-year-old Shane Devon Tamura drove from Las Vegas to New York and opened fire at the building, killing four people, including New York police officer Didarul Islam. The suspect also died, according to police. Tamura worked in the surveillance department at Horseshoe Las Vegas, Caesars said.

Blackstone said one of its employees, Wesley LePatner, was killed in the shooting.

In a press conference on Tuesday, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said a preliminary investigation indicated Tamura intended to go to NFL offices but took the wrong elevator bank.

Adams said authorities found a note the gunman left that might have suggested a grievance against the NFL over a claim that he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE.

CTE is a brain injury thought to be linked to repeated trauma to the head.

Tamura played high school football in California but never played in the NFL, Adams said.

Goodell told New York employees that they should work remotely on Tuesday and that he will be increasing security at the building in the days and weeks to come.

He also directed employees to grief counselors and support options.

""Every one of you is a valued member of the NFL family. We will get through this together,"" Goodell said.

In this article

JPMorgan Chase, already the largest credit card issuer in the U.S., is nearing a deal to take over the Apple Card portfolio from Goldman Sachs, people familiar with the matter told CNBC.

The banks declined to comment to CNBC. Apple did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Negotiations between JPMorgan and Apple have progressed as earlier contenders for the card including American Express, Synchrony and Barclays have fallen to the side, said the people, who declined to be identified speaking about the agreement.

A deal for JPMorgan to take over the Apple Card and its huge book of loans would further burnish the bank's reputation as a leader in American finance. With JPMorgan-branded and co-branded cards, the Jamie Dimon-led company is the country's largest issuer by purchase volume.

For Goldman, offloading the Apple Card business would help it move past a rocky chapter for CEO David Solomon. Goldman entered the credit card business with great fanfare in 2019 by beating out other issuers for the Apple Card.

But the high growth rates of the card, coupled with accounting requirements that forced it to front-load reserves for future losses, caught Goldman flat footed. Solomon, who was facing pressure from partners unhappy about the consumer business, made the call to divest the card business partly out of concern that loan losses would rise in a recession, according to one of the sources.

Goldman had $20.5 billion in total credit card loans at the end of March. The bank is also in the process of moving its General Motors card business to Barclays.

For Apple, JPMorgan would bring stability after years marked by high growth, but also regulatory scrutiny over how Goldman handled billing and refunds in the business. Goldman had signed up to service the card through at least 2029.

JPMorgan is seen as more disciplined than Goldman was in that it will only sign an agreement if concessions are made over how the Apple Card is serviced, among other sticking points, one of the people familiar with the discussions said.

The Wall Street Journal earlier reported on the advanced card talks.

Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., on Monday introduced a bill to send tariff rebate checks to American families, which would be similar to the stimulus checks sent during the Covid-19 pandemic.

If enacted, the American Worker Rebate Act of 2025 would provide ""at least"" $600 per adult and dependent child, or $2,400 for a family of four, according to a statement from Hawley. The bill allows for a larger rebate if tariff revenue exceeds projections.

Whatever the final amount, the benefit would be reduced by 5% for joint filers with an adjusted gross income above $150,000 or single filers earning more than $75,000.

The Senate bill comes after President Donald Trump on Friday told reporters the administration was ""thinking about a little rebate"" for Americans from tariff revenue.

More from Personal Finance:Trump's tariffs could soon bring higher food prices for some AmericansAhead of the Fed meeting, here's where borrowing rates standEven many high-earning Americans don't feel wealthy. Here's why

""Like President Trump proposed, my legislation would allow hard-working Americans to benefit from the wealth that Trump's tariffs are returning to this country,"" Hawley said in a statement.

However, it's unclear whether the proposal has broad Republican support, particularly among fiscally conservative lawmakers.

Earlier this year, Trump and Elon Musk floated a $5,000 dividend check for Americans, funded by savings from the Department of Government of Efficiency. However, that idea has not happened.

The Treasury Department reported an unexpected surplus for June, with a boost from tariff revenue. Customs duties totaled roughly $27 billion for the month, compared to $23 billion in May. The duties reflect a 301% gain from June 2024.   

The tariff rebate check proposal comes as a chorus of lawmakers and policy experts voice concerns about the federal budget deficit.

""I don't think [a rebate] would be particularly good policy,"" Tax Foundation senior economist Alex Durante told CNBC on Friday. ""I would prefer that the revenue was used for deficit reduction rather than just cutting checks to people.""

Enacted in early July, Trump's ""one big beautiful"" tax-and-spending package could add an estimated $3.4 trillion to the deficit through 2034, according to a conventional score released by the Congressional Budget Office this week.

The motivation for sending the direct payments would be different than they were during the Covid pandemic, when many households were losing income or unable to work, said Joseph Rosenberg, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center's tax and income supports division.

Now, the federal government is imposing tariffs that will cost U.S. households, and this would be a way of helping those individuals and families, Rosenberg said.

Tariffs are a tax imposed by foreign nations, paid by domestic companies that import goods or services. U.S. consumers are expected to pay higher prices via companies negatively impacted by the trade policy.

An analysis from The Budget Lab at Yale released Monday found Trump's tariffs could cost U.S. households an average of $2,400 in 2025.

Because Congress just passed the very expensive ""big beautiful"" budget and tax legislation, rebates to individuals could exacerbate the effects on the federal budget deficit, he said.

The rebates would reinforce the inflationary effects of the tariffs that already exist, Rosenberg said.

""People will go out and spend some of that money, and that would further put upward pressure on prices and probably magnify inflationary effects,"" Rosenberg said.

Pandemic-era fiscal stimulus contributed to an increase in inflation of about 2.6 percentage points in the U.S., according to 2023 research from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

Faced with intensifying pressure from President Donald Trump to bring more jobs to the U.S., Apple is opening a manufacturing program in downtown Detroit.

The Apple Manufacturing Academy, which is being administered by Michigan State University, will offer workshops on manufacturing and artificial intelligence to small and medium-sized businesses when it opens in August, Apple said on Tuesday. The company said that it would ""train the next generation of U.S. manufacturers"" and that Apple engineers would participate in the workshops.

Apple is one of the most admired hardware companies in the world, manufacturing tens of millions of complicated devices each year across a global supply chain.

""With this new programming, we're thrilled to help even more businesses implement smart manufacturing so they can unlock amazing opportunities for their companies and our country,"" Sabih Khan, Apple's newly named chief operating officer, said in the statement.

The announcement is part of a public effort by Apple to highlight its U.S. operations and investments to appease Trump, who has called on the company to move iPhone production to the U.S. while he implements tariffs that will likely raise Apple's costs.

Apple first promised to open the Apple Manufacturing Academy in February, when it announced plans to spend more than $500 billion in the U.S. over the next five years, investing in products, programs and companies. Apple also said it would assemble AI servers in Houston and buy chips from a TSMC factory based in Arizona.

While Trump hailed Apple's plans in February, his administration has continued to try and strong-arm the company into assembling iPhones in the U.S., which experts say would be cost prohibitive and take a very long time. In May, Trump said he had a ""little problem"" with CEO Tim Cook, who had said that Apple expanded production to India to avoid Chinese tariffs.

""I said to him, 'my friend, I treated you very good. You're coming here with $500 billion, but now I hear you're building all over India.' I don't want you building in India,"" Trump said.

Apple runs a similar program focusing on software development, instead of manufacturing. Apple has 18 developer academies around the world, according to its website, notably in countries where the iPhone maker wants to forge a working relationship with governments, such as Brazil, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and South Korea. The only developer academy in the U.S. is also based in Detroit, in partnership with Michigan State, which said this spring that it has about 200 students annually.

Apple said that it would provide consulting services to small businesses through the program, and that the manufacturing academy would also offer some courses virtually later this year.

In this article

Spotify shares dropped more than 11% Tuesday after the music streaming service fell short of Wall Street's expectations and posted weak guidance for the current quarter.

Shares headed for their worst session since July 2023.

Here's how the company did versus LSEG estimates:

The Swedish platform's revenues rose 10% from about 3.81 billion euros in the year-ago period. The company posted a net loss of 86 million euros, or a loss of .42 euros per share, down from net income of 225 million euros, or 1.10 euros per share a year ago.

Spotify said that higher personnel, marketing and professional services costs and 115 million euros worth of what it called social charges contributed to the results.

Third-quarter guidance came up short of Wall Street's forecast.

The company expects revenues to reach 4.2 billion euros, compared to a 4.47 billion euro estimate from StreetAccount. Spotify said the forecast accounts for a 490-basis-point headwind due to foreign exchange rates.

Monthly active users on the platform jumped 11% to 696 million, while paying subscribers rose 12% from a year ago to 276 million. Ad-tier subscribers account for over 60% of Spotify's monthly users.

For the current quarter, Spotify said it expects to reach 710 million monthly active users, with 14 million net adds. The company expects 5 million net new premium subscribers in the third quarter to reach 281 million subscriptions.

Spotify's advertising-supported revenues declined about 1% to 453 million euros from 456 million euros a year ago. The company said it sees promise in its advertising stack and demand given its strong user base and will focus on adoption and new tools in the second half. Some areas of opportunity include business and automated ads.

""It's really an execution challenge, not a problem with the strategy,"" said CEO Daniel Ek during an earnings call. ""While I'm unhappy with where we are today, I remain confident in the ambitions we laid out for this business, and we're working quickly to ensure we're on the right path.""

Ek said the company is seeing some ""promising signs"" in its programmatic business.

During the period, Spotify said it rolled out a request feature for its artificial intelligence DJ. The company said engagement with its AI DJ has roughly doubled over the last year. Its audiobooks feature expanded to four new countries during the quarter, and listening hours jumped 35% in the U.S., U.K. and Australia.

Earlier this year, an indie rock band on the platform known as Velvet Sundown gained media attention after it quickly captured over a million new listeners and raised questions over artificial intelligence use in music creation. The ""band"" was later confirmed to be mainly AI-generated after widespread speculation.

In 2024, Spotify posted its first full year of profitability as it slashed costs and hiked prices. Over the years, the company has prioritized subscriber gains and invested beyond music in podcasts and audiobooks. Apple Music remains one of its top competitors.

Spotify said it ended the quarter with more than 7,300 full-time employees and upped its share repurchase program by $1 billion. Shares are up more than 40% this year.

It's a virtual three-way tie to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell as Fed chair when his term expires.

The CNBC Fed Survey found 24% of respondents saying President Donald Trump will replace Powell with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and 24% saying it will be former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh.

Close behind is Kevin Hassett, director of the president's National Economic Council with 22%. More distant is current Fed Governor Chris Waller at 14%.

Trump repeatedly has called for Powell's resignation, saying he's been late to cut interest rates, and has considered firing him.

He's also accused the Fed chair of mismanaging a $2.5 billion renovation of its headquarters and a separate building, a charge Powell has denied and for which the president has provided no evidence beyond the cost overruns.

After a recent visit to the construction site, the president appeared to ease off on his criticism of the project and the Fed's monetary policy and suggested he would not fire Powell. Powell's term as chair concludes in May 2026 though he can stay on as governor if he wishes until 2028.

In the survey, 84% said the president would not fire Powell before his term ends in May. The 37 respondents include fund managers, economists and strategists.

""With the jockeying going on to become the next Fed chair already appearing inside the Fed, it is clear the Fed's independence has already been compromised,"" economist Joel Naroff wrote. ""This has elevated long rates and weakened the dollar. There is little to believe that would change, especially given the expectation that the next Fed chair will be a Trump loyalist.""

Overall, respondents gave Powell a grade of B -, up from C+ when CNBC last asked the question in 2023. He received solid B's on leadership, transparency, market knowledge and communication, but a C- on economic forecasting (up from a D in 2023). Respondents graded Powell with a B- on economic and regulatory expertise.

Former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke left office with a final grade of B and Janet Yellen's final grade was a B+.

The president's pressure on the Fed to cut rate is believed by some respondents to be having the opposite effect.

While 56% say it's having no impact on policy, 42% believe it makes rate cuts less likely. Just 3% say it makes cuts more likely. No respondent forecasts a rate cut at this meeting, although 27% believe the Fed should cut.

There could be two dissents at the meeting as two Trump-appointed governors have said they supported lower rates in July. But survey respondents see those cuts coming, with 65% expected one in September and another one likely before year end. That would bring the funds rate down to about 3.9%.

Further cuts are forecast for 2026, with the average respondent putting the funds rate at 3.5%, though that will remain above the average neutral rate of 3.3%.

Tariff uncertainty remains the No. 1 threat to the expansion, followed by overall uncertainty about the president's policy and continued high inflation. But overall, some of the uncertainty sparked by administration's policies have eased.

Uncertainty around the economic impact of tariffs fell to 62% from 71% in June. And 65% expect a trade deal with China, up from 54%. A 51% majority now believes tariffs will result in only one-time price increases, rather than broader inflation, an 8-point gain from June.

""Trumpian uncertainties on the economy and policies are settling down,"" wrote Allen Sinai, chief global economist/strategist at Decision Economics. ""That is clarifying and very positive for equities. But there are still big, big societal, political, geopolitical, and non-economic uncertainties.""

Along with less uncertainty has come a modest boost in the economic outlook.

The probability of a recession in the next year has fallen to 31% from 38% in June and 53% in May after the president announced sharply higher ""reciprocal"" tariffs. GDP is forecast to rise 1.4%, up from 1.1% in June, though still below the more optimistic 2.4% in January.

The outlook remains for a recovery next year with an average 2.2% GDP forecast in 2026.

Unemployment is seen rising only slightly from the current rate of 4.1% to 4.4% this year and remaining stable at that level in 2026. But there are widespread concerns about the labor market slowing.

""Employment is not as good as some believe,"" said Drew T. Matus, chief market strategist, MetLife Investment Management. ""This, combined with housing issues and ongoing volatility, is likely to prompt a significant slowing in activity as we approach year-end.""

For most respondents, employment looks to be the key to whether Fed is in the right place.

""The labor market is slowing, and the housing market is deflating. Ultimately this will force the Fed to cut interest rates,"" said Troy Ludtka, senior US economist at SMBC Nikko Securities Americas.

But Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist, National Retail Federation, wrote, ""A relatively balanced labor market, the recent rise in the [personal consumption expenditures price index], and the potential for tariffs to push up inflation in the coming months justifies the cautious pace by the Federal Reserve. Even though uncertainty continues, the economy is expected to grow.""

Despite better growth and less uncertainty, respondents are cautious about the stock market this year.

The average respondent puts the year-end S&P 500 level at 6,344, below the close on Monday. It's forecast to rise to 6,936 next year, a 9% increase.

But there's also greater concern about overvaluation, as 84% see stocks as somewhat or extremely overvalued, up from 58% in June, and the highest in a year.

When it comes to job interviews, your body language can be just as crucial, and as communicative, as your resume.

According to Benjamin Granger, chief workplace psychologist at software company Qualtrics, your posture, expression and behavior are key to making a good first impression.

""When we meet somebody for the first time, what we don't realize fully is that our brains are at work,"" he says. ""They are looking at the person's face, they're looking at the person's body, they're looking at how open or closed off they are.""

Subconsciously, those nonverbal cues influence your perception of that person, Granger says.

Granger shares more body language tips in Smarter by CNBC Make It's course, How to Ace Your Job Interview. Here are four of his top pointers to bring your best self to a job interview.

This tip may sound obvious, but ""it's amazing what a simple smile can do"" to build goodwill with your interviewer, Granger says.

Whether you realize it or not, most people can actually tell whether your smile is authentic or forced, he says.

According to Granger, a ""real, genuine smile"" causes small wrinkles at the edges of your eyes.

""If you ever see somebody who has a lot of wrinkles there, it might be a good tip that that's a genuine person,"" he says.

Posture is another crucial communication tool, Granger says.

To make a good impression at a job interview, Granger recommends sitting in an ""open body posture""  with your shoulders back and hands separated. That body language communicates to your interviewer that you are engaged in the conversation, he says.

On the other hand, sitting in a closed body posture with crossed arms or legs might signal that you're uninterested in the conversation, or possibly even hiding something.

Additionally, Granger says, make sure that your torso and legs are facing the interviewer squarely.

""Generally speaking, the legs tell you where the person wants to go,"" he says, so avoid pointing your legs toward the exit.

There's an old adage that you can learn a lot about a person through their handshake — and it's absolutely true, Granger says.

According to Granger, there are three main types of handshake, each with a different meaning.

An even handshake is ""by far the best handshake to use in business and also in interviews,"" he says.

In an even handshake, you deliver a firm squeeze with your palms parallel to the other person's. ""It communicates that you view the other person as your equal,"" Granger says.

The underhand handshake, in which the other person's hand sits on top of yours, signals that you are giving them the upper hand — literally.

The opposite is true for the over-the-hand handshake, which can communicate that you are trying to assert dominance.

Of course, you can't control what kind of handshake your interviewer will give you, but in any case, remember the key principles of open body language, Granger says: ""Shoulders back, head up, chin up, be confident.""

""The number one tip that I wish people would really believe in interviewing is just to be yourself,"" Granger says.

Often, people feel like they have to ""put on a show"" in interviews, he says.

It's natural to want to present the best version of yourself, but your body language will quickly reveal whether or not you are behaving authentically.

""If you fake it, they will know,"" Granger says. Consciously or not, ""there's a pretty good chance that the interviewer is going to feel like something's wrong.""

Instead, head into the interview with a positive, confident attitude.

""Assume that this is going to be an exciting experience,"" Granger says. ""Assume that you're getting to meet somebody you're about to work with for the next few years. That allows you to go into that meeting, meet that person for the first time, and give a really authentic, genuine smile.""

President Donald Trump's blanket tariffs scheduled to begin on Aug. 1 could soon bring higher prices on certain foods, according to some experts.

Tariffs are a tax imposed by foreign nations, paid by domestic companies that import goods or services. U.S. consumers are expected to pay higher prices via companies negatively impacted by the trade policy.

One of the goals of Trump's tariffs is to drive demand for American products. But certain items, such as Brazilian coffee, aren't produced domestically. Other imports, like bananas, have limited U.S. production, which wouldn't meet American demand, according to a Tax Foundation analysis published Monday.

In some cases, U.S. consumers may decide to pay more for these imported food products rather than choosing a substitute, wrote Tax Foundation senior economist Alex Durante.

In 2024, U.S. food product imports totaled about $221 billion. Most of these products already face tariffs ranging from 10% to 30%. However, levies could exceed 30% for some countries if Trump's Aug. 1 tariffs go into effect, the Tax Foundation found.

""We could see some large movements in prices over the next few months if the administration holds firm to that Aug. 1 deadline,"" Durante told CNBC.

The top five imported foods by volume that could face tariffs are liqueurs and spirits, baked goods, coffee, fish and beer, which account for roughly 21% of total U.S. food imports, according to the Tax Foundation analysis.

Grocery prices were about 2.4% higher than one year ago, according to the latest inflation report based on June data. But the full impact of Trump's tariffs is not yet reflected, experts say.

""It's way too soon for the administration to be doing a victory lap because most of their planned tariff increases have not gone into effect yet,"" Durante told CNBC.

A separate analysis by The Budget Lab at Yale, also from Monday, estimated that tariff price increases to date will raise food costs by 3.4% in the short-run, and that prices will stay 2.9% higher in the long-run. Fresh produce could initially be 6.9% more expensive while stabilizing at 3.6% higher, the analysis found.

""The Administration has consistently maintained that the cost of tariffs will be borne by foreign exporters who rely on access to the American economy, the world's biggest and best consumer market,"" White House spokesperson Kush Desai told CNBC in a statement.

Desai also shared a July analysis from the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, which showed the prices of imported goods, as measured by the personal consumption expenditure price index, fell from December through May.

Pharma firms are calling for clarity on tariffs imposed under the new U.S.-EU trade agreement, as analysts warn that punitive sector-specific levies could risk blowing up the entire deal.

Ambiguity abounds around the terms for pharmaceutical goods under the trade truce agreed Sunday, which imposes 15% tariffs on EU goods imported to the U.S. 

U.S. President Donald Trump announced a ""straight across"" tariff on ""automobiles and everything else,"" during a news briefing, while simultaneously suggesting that pharma was ""unrelated to this deal.""

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, meanwhile, dubbed the agreed levy as ""all-inclusive,"" and indicated that Europe would be excluded from a forthcoming announcement on pharma tariffs.

""We have 15% for pharmaceuticals. Whatever the decision later on is, of the president of the U.S., how to deal with pharmaceuticals in general globally, that's on a different sheet of paper,"" Von der Leyen said Sunday.

President Trump said earlier this month that a tariff announcement on pharmaceutical imports into the U.S. would come ""very soon"" and could run as high as 200%. It comes after the administration launched a so-called Section 232 investigation into the sector, which explores the impact of pharma imports on national security, with the outcome due by August.

Even if pharma tariffs were to come in at the lower 15% range, analysts suggest the hit to European firms and the bloc's broader economy would be significant.

""The questions around pharma tariffs are highly material, given the volume of imports from the EU,"" Wolfe Research analysts wrote in a note Monday.

Medicines and pharmaceutical products represent the EU's largest export to the U.S., totaling around $120 billion in 2024. Analysts estimate that 15% levies could ramp up industry costs by $13 billion to $19 billion per year, according to Reuters.

If the rate were to come in higher, however, they say it could undermine the long-negotiated deal.

""Any surprise increases to the 15% ceiling on pharma tariffs would threaten the broader trade truce,"" Eurasia Group analysts wrote in a Monday note.

""If any dispute about these sectoral tariffs does not sabotage the broader agreement,"" the hit to the European economy could be severe, Rabobank analysts added.

In the meantime, firms are left struggling to navigate the uncertainty.

""We've been asking for exemptions from [tariffs] in the U.S., in the EU, but also in China. That's something we have been pleading for,"" Philips CEO Roy Jakobs told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Tuesday.

""In the current deal that has been announced that was not part of it, so we keep having that dialogue.""

In this article

As companies lean into value offerings and buzzy beverages to lure price-sensitive consumers, Starbucks is doubling down on its plans to get back to basics by leaning into hospitality at its cafes.

The coffee giant aims to stand out on guest experience in a cutthroat consumer environment as it tries to boost lackluster sales.

Last week, the company began training baristas on its new ""Green Apron Service"" program as part of CEO Brian Niccol's ""Back to Starbucks"" plans, which have emphasized friendlier cafes and a human touch like Sharpie drawings on cups. Green Apron Service builds on that, relying on warm and engaging interactions with customers in the hopes of making Starbucks visits a habit.

The program is backed by changes to ensure proper staffing and better technology to keep service times fast. It was born out of growth in digital orders, which now make up more than 30% of sales, and feedback from baristas.

""The strategy is to reconnect our partners with our customers,"" Chief Operating Officer Mike Grams told CNBC from a newly revamped store in Seattle on Monday.

""When you walk through that door, you're greeted with a smile. You are greeted again at handoff, a perfect cup of coffee ... and you're met with that connection.""

Investors will get another look into how Niccol's turnaround plans are working when the company reports earnings after the market close Tuesday. Starbucks shares have climbed about 2.7% this year, trailing the 8.6% gains of the S&P 500, as Wall Street debates how long it will take Niccol to improve the chain's performance. Since Niccol took the reins last September, the stock is up just under 3%, and has climbed nearly 25% on a one-year basis.

Niccol is trying to jump-start the coffee chain's sales. Last quarter, same-store sales fell for the fifth quarter in a row.

Grams and the push for more welcoming cafes will play a major role in that effort.

Grams was appointed as chief operating officer in June, overseeing global coffeehouse development, the company's worldwide supply chain and its North American coffeehouses. He came to Starbucks in February after nearly three decades at Taco Bell, where he was previously was the chain's president and global chief operating officer. Niccol was once Taco Bell's chief executive. 

The Green Apron Service push is the largest investment the company has ever made in hospitality and its store employees, Grams said. The company did not provide a dollar figure for the investment.

Part of the plan involves Smart Queue technology, which uses algorithms to enhance staffing and scheduling, to help baristas deliver more consistent and higher-quality service, Grams said. The company wants customers to experience consistency in service quality whether they order in store or online.

""You will see it show up in different ways,"" he said. ""You may see a digital host out front who is navigating that experience ... it can be an extra person at the drive through. The idea is just really making sure that we've got the right partners in the right place at the right time throughout the entire day.""

Success of the Green Apron Service initiative will be tied directly to measurable indicators like customer experience scores, foot traffic growth and store productivity.

The effort also comes as cafes face new benchmarks for success, including delivering customized drinks in four minutes or less. Early results from its 1,500-store pilot of Green Apron Service showed improvements in transactions, sales and customer service times, with 80% of in-cafe orders meeting the chain's four-minute goal.

Continuing to build on that trend will likely be key for Starbucks. The reality is customers may prefer speed over warmth and have little tolerance for long waits.

Grams said Starbucks has multiple avenues to remain competitive, including a strong digital business, drive-thrus in more than 7,000 stores and cafes going through ""uplifts"" to make them more comfortable.

""It's showing up in a way where we touch all three channels,"" he said of the hospitality initiative. ""We have 20,000 units across North America, which gives us a terrific competitive advantage.""

Oops, something went wrong

Publicly listed Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) treasury companies are no longer just passive holders of BTC.

A new financial model, leveraging traditional capital markets tools like share issuance and fixed-income debt, is enabling these firms to outperform Bitcoin itself in BTC terms.

At the core of this model is a focus on growing the Bitcoin-per-share (BPS) ratio.

Rather than simply tracking Bitcoin's price, these companies aim to accumulate more BTC per outstanding share over time.

The result is a growing “BTC yield,” a return denominated not in fiat but in Bitcoin units.

Strategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), the most prominent example, has perfected this playbook.

The company regularly conducts at-the-market (ATM) equity offerings, issuing new shares when its stock is trading at a premium to its net asset value (NAV).

The capital raised is immediately used to purchase more BTC.

Despite diluting shareholders in nominal terms, these actions are accretive to the BPS ratio, meaning that each share is backed by more BTC than before.

This mechanism only works when the company's market cap trades above the value of its Bitcoin holdings.

In this scenario, equity issuance allows the company to extract a premium from short-term buyers, reinvesting it into BTC to benefit long-term holders.

The higher the market premium, the greater the accretive yield.

This dynamic has allowed Strategy to achieve what some call BTC-native outperformance.

In 2024 alone, Strategy delivered a 75% BTC yield for its shareholders.

That is, if a share was backed by 0.001 BTC at the beginning of the year, it was backed by 0.00175 BTC by year-end without BTC needing to rise in price.

The second leg of this model is leverage.

Treasury companies can issue debt at interest rates lower than their expected Bitcoin CAGR (compound annual growth rate), using the proceeds to acquire more BTC.

For example, if BTC is expected to grow 20% annually and the firm can borrow at 8%, the 12% spread is effectively captured as additional BPS growth.

When used conservatively, over long durations and with manageable liquidation thresholds, this leverage enhances BTC returns without exposing the company to short-term volatility risk.

Taken together, these two tools, ATM equity issuance and strategic debt financing, turn treasury companies into what analysts are calling ""full-stack Bitcoin yield engines.""

Critics often label these stocks as overpriced, citing high market cap-to-NAV (mNAV) ratios.

But within this framework, a premium mNAV can be rational: if the BTC yield from BPS growth equals or exceeds the premium paid, long-term holders still win.

In fact, a high mNAV enables more effective equity issuance, further reinforcing the flywheel of BTC accumulation.

This model stands in stark contrast to altcoin treasury companies, which typically rely only on equity issuance and face higher risk due to the less predictable performance of their underlying assets.

Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) treasury companies, for instance, have yet to meaningfully deploy debt-based strategies to scale BPS, though Standard Chartered recently projected they could eventually hold 10% of all ETH if they follow a similar model.

 The US is seeking the forfeiture of 20.2 BTC seized by the Dallas FBI from the Chaos ransomware group, adding to the country's proposed Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. 

The United States has filed a civil complaint seeking the forfeiture of $2.4 million in Bitcoin seized by the Dallas FBI, bolstering the proposed US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.

The civil complaint filed in the Northern District of Texas on Thursday calls for the forfeiture of 20.2 Bitcoin (BTC) seized from an address allegedly associated with a member of the Chaos hacker group, which has been tied to ransomware attacks, the Texas US Attorney's Office said in a statement on Monday.

Dallas FBI executed the crypto seizure on April 15 this year, according to the complaint, alleging it was the proceeds of “unlawful activity” related to ransomware attacks.

If the seizure is successful, the Bitcoin could add to the US Bitcoin reserve, which US President Donald Trump mandated in his March 6 executive order, would be created through tokens seized through criminal or civil asset forfeiture.

It's estimated that the US government holds 198,012 BTC of Bitcoin by Nansen, Arkham and BitcoinTreasuries.NET, seized through various seizures over the years; however, a freedom of information request from an independent journalist recently called that into question.

The journalist who posts on X under the handle L0la L33tz said on July 16 that they had received a response from the Department of Justice regarding a freedom of information request made in March, which revealed the United States Marshals Service (USMS) only held slightly more than 28,988 Bitcoin.

However, in a subsequent post, L0la L33tz said the figure shared doesn't take into account seizing agencies, like the DEA or the FBI, “meaning that there may be other custody offices than the USMS.” 

Blockchain analytics firm Arkham made similar claims on July 23, pointing out that “other departments of the US Government also seize and hold Bitcoin, including the FBI, DOJ, DEA, and US Attorney's Offices.”

Arkham maintains that its data shows the US government holds at least 198,000 Bitcoin across multiple addresses held by different government arms, and none have moved the tokens for four months.

L0la L33tz, however, argued that some of the Bitcoin trackers “don't seem to differentiate between seized and forfeited coins,” because in some cases, the status of the assets as either seized or forfeited is still up in the air.

“To the geniuses that have linked Arkham ‘s gov wallet tracker: these do not seem to be BTC that have been made the Gov's property - at least not exclusively - which means they can't sell them,” L0la L33tz said.

At least 30 US states have also introduced Bitcoin strategic reserve legislation, according to Bitcoin Laws. However, only Arizona, Texas and New Hampshire have passed related laws as of July 29. 

Dozens have failed and been voted down by lawmakers before making it past the first committee phase.

Bitcoin mining company MARA Holdings (MARA) has completed a $950 million offering of 0.00% convertible senior notes due 2032, with the majority of proceeds earmarked to purchase additional bitcoin. 

The offering, which could expand to $1.15 billion if underwriters exercise their option in full, MARA announced on Monday.

Net proceeds of approximately $940.5 million will also be used to retire $19.4 million in existing 1.00% notes due 2026, fund capped call transactions to mitigate dilution risk, and support general corporate initiatives. The capped calls were priced with a strike at $24.14 per share, representing a 40% premium to MARA's $17.24 reference price.

MARA has long championed a bitcoin-focused treasury strategy, opting to accumulate rather than sell its mined bitcoin. The company holds roughly 50,000 BTC, valued at nearly $6 billion, ranking it as the second-largest bitcoin holder among public companies, according to data tracked by Bitcoin Treasuries.

MARA shares closed at $17.16 on Monday, down 0.52% on the day. The mining firm is expected to report its earnings on Aug. 7.

Ethereum layer-2 network Linea wants to become the best place for ETH ecosystem capital in the future. And to further that aim, the network's builders shared plans to launch a LINEA token for the chain with an associated ecosystem fund.

Linea creator Consensys said its plan revolves around a commitment to the Ethereum base layer with new ecosystem mechanics like native yield on bridged ETH and ETH burns. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.)

It also includes the creation of the Linea Consortium—a group of Ethereum-aligned companies including publicly traded treasury company SharpLink Gaming—that will collectively steward 75% of the eventual LINEA token distribution via what the network calls the “largest Ethereum ecosystem fund by allocation.” 

“Linea is going to be the chain for ETH capital,” Declan Fox, Head of Linea at Consensys, told Decrypt. “We're building these mechanisms in this Ethereum-centric token design and economic design to basically be the best place for ETH capital.” 

Designed to bootstrap and drive development on the network and via Ethereum, consortium members—which also include Consensys, Eigen Labs, ENS Labs, and Status—will be in charge of “thoughtfully distributing” LINEA tokens to help grow both the layer-2 network and Ethereum itself, according to Fox. 

Who might ultimately receive those tokens? 

“It's users, it's builders, it's liquidity providers, it's institutions, it's creators… anything or anyone that's going to help make Ethereum and Linea successful,” he said, later adding that the consortium's full charter is expected to be published in the coming weeks, ahead of Linea's token generation event. 

The network also plans to benefit users on-chain as well, directly burning 20% of all net transaction fees (paid in ETH) while using the remaining 80% of net fees to burn LINEA, creating a deflationary flywheel proportional to network activity.

“As Linea grows, it actually provides value back to ETH holders directly,"" said Fox, who added that the network's builders really see Linea as an extension of Ethereum. 

That network alignment was apparent to newly appointed SharpLink co-CEO Joseph Chalom, who said in a statement that “Linea's commitment to Ethereum couldn't be more clear,” and that its “unique alignment with Ethereum will make [Linea] an important part of its future.” 

The alignment between Ethereum and its layer-2s hasn't always been seen as a positive though, with some investors and analysts suggesting that the scaling networks have taken value away from Ethereum's mainnet. 

That problem was acknowledged by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in January, who said that ecosystem developers need to “think explicitly about [the] economics of ETH,” going as far to suggest layer-2s burn a portion of their fees to support ETH—the same endeavor Linea is undertaking.

Summary: raise the blobs, work hard on interop and security, think about economics. See the post for more details on each topic.

Ethereum's future is bright.

— vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 24, 2025



That future has seemed brighter of late, as ETH has charged back towards a price of nearly $4,000 in recent weeks, hitting a 2025 high in the process. However, it still remains more than 21% off its all-time high of $4,878 from 2021.

ETH is currently priced at $3,824. Myriad users give Ethereum a 30% chance of being above $4,000 at the end of July. (Disclosure: Myriad is a product of Decrypt's parent company, DASTAN.)

In Fox's eyes, the success of Linea comes down to the success of Ethereum. 

“Our north star is really about Ethereum,” he said. “Linea success will be derived by the world believing and knowing that Ethereum is the future global layer of decentralized finance and the wider ecosystem, and also, [that] ETH is the most important digital asset in the world.” 

More specifically though? 

“For us, it will be the amount of ETH capital actively deployed on Linea mainnet,” he added. “We intend to provide the best risk-adjusted return for ETH capital.”

Electric Capital wird als externer Vermögensverwalter fungieren und ein On-Chain-Ertragsprogramm umsetzen, das traditionelle ETH-Staking übertreffen soll. Das Unternehmen plant zudem den Start mit Etherealize als Schlüsselpartner und die Gründung eines DeFi-Rats, der aus Ökosystemführern besteht und die Treasury-Verwaltung leitet.

180 Life Sciences' $425M raise to pivot to ETH treasury strategy marks dramatic shift from biotech to crypto, creating unique Ethereum exposure vehicle.

This announcement represents a complete strategic transformation for 180 Life Sciences. The company is raising $425 million through a private placement to establish an Ethereum treasury, with plans to rebrand as ETHZilla Corporation. This move essentially converts the company from a biotech firm into a publicly-traded Ethereum investment vehicle.

The backing from over 60 institutional and crypto-native investors, including prominent Ethereum ecosystem founders, gives this pivot substantial credibility. Electric Capital will serve as external asset manager implementing an on-chain yield generation program designed to outperform traditional ETH staking through diversified strategies including staking, lending, and liquidity provisioning.

What distinguishes this approach from other crypto treasury strategies is the formation of a DeFi Council comprising ecosystem leaders to advise on yield generation while supporting Ethereum's development. This creates a unique investment proposition - a publicly-traded company offering ETH exposure with potentially enhanced returns beyond simple staking.

However, the offering will cause significant shareholder dilution, and the implementation timeline appears aggressive with closing expected by August 1, 2025. The company also plans to issue up to $150 million in debt securities following the PIPE, which could further impact its financial structure.

This strategic pivot represents a remarkable departure from 180 Life Sciences' previous focus, essentially transforming it into a financial vehicle for institutional Ethereum exposure through traditional markets. The transaction's success will largely depend on ETH's performance and the management team's ability to generate superior yields while managing the substantial risks inherent in cryptocurrency markets.

180 Life Sciences announces entry into PIPE funding documents to raise $425 million in gross proceeds to launch next generation Ethereum treasury strategy and planned rebranding to ETHZilla

PALO ALTO, Calif., July 29, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- 180 Life Sciences Corp. (Nasdaq: ATNF) (the ""Company"" or ""180 Life Sciences"") today announced that it plans to adopt a treasury policy under which the principal holding in its treasury reserve will be Ether (""ETH""), the native digital asset of Ethereum. Following the closing of the transaction, the Company intends to rebrand to ETHZilla Corporation.







Transaction Overview

The offering consists of an approximately $425 million private investment in public equity transaction (""PIPE"") for the purchase and sale of common stock (and pre-funded warrants, if applicable). The investors will be granted registration rights as part of the transaction. The PIPE transaction is expected to close on or around August 1, 2025, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. In addition, the Company has approval to sell an aggregate amount of up to $150 million in debt securities and expects to announce an offering following the closing of the PIPE. The consummation of any subsequent offering is subject to the satisfaction and completion of definitive documentation.

Upon closing, the Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering primarily for the purchase of ETH, as well as general corporate purposes and transaction expenses. The Company's current management team and a majority of the Company's directors will remain in place.

Over 60 institutional and crypto-native investors in the PIPE transaction including Harbour Island, Electric Capital, Polychain Capital, GSR, Omicron Technologies, Konstantin Lomashuk (Co-Founder Lido and p2p.org), Sreeram Kannan (Founder, Eigenlayer), Mike Silagadze (Founder,  Ether.fi), Danny Ryan (Co-Founder, Etherealize), Vivek Raman (Co-Founder, Etherealize), Sam Kazemanian (Co-Founder, Frax), Grant Hummer (Co-Founder of Etherealize), Robert Leshner (Founder, Compound and Superstate), Tarun Chitra (Founder, Gauntlet) and several other prominent Ethereum ecosystem founders and leaders.

""The Ethereum network has a market cap over $450 billion today, which exceeds many of the most well-known companies in the world and powers some of the major innovations taking the global financial system by storm today,"" said McAndrew Rudisill, who is expected become chairman of the board of directors of the Company at closing. ""Our strategy at closing aims to allow investors to access exposure to a strong-yield potential ecosystem at the heart of the stablecoin and tokenized asset markets. At closing, we expect to assemble an incredible team of well-regarded veterans across traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi) to help guide this new chapter in the Company's journey.""

At closing, Electric Capital will serve as the external asset manager for the Company, and plans to implement a differentiated, on-chain yield generation program. This program will be designed with the goal of outperforming traditional ETH staking, while maintaining robust risk management, seeking to leverage a combination of staking, lending, liquidity provisioning and bespoke private agreements.

""We believe that this planned strategy reflects a strong, long-term investment approach that can be supported by a highly capable team and a transformative transaction,"" said Blair Jordan, CEO of the Company. ""We plan to execute a differentiated investment approach that will be designed to provide a straightforward opportunity for investors to participate in the growth of Ethereum through the public markets.""

""The Company aims to differentiate itself from other Ethereum treasury strategy players by its commitment to and collaboration with the builders and allocators who have brought the ecosystem to prominence,"" said Etherealize CEO, Vivek Raman, who is expected to serve as a strategic advisor to the Company. ""As we arrive at the ten-year anniversary of Ethereum, we're proud to partner with the Company to support a treasury strategy that will be community-designed and strategically deployed.""

Investment Highlights

The Company expects to be positioned to deliver immediate value to shareholders upon the close of this transaction, and through the execution of its long-term investment strategy to acquire ETH and generate yield using the Company's ETH treasury.

The Company plans to launch with a key partner in Etherealize. Etherealize brings key strategic partnerships with current leaders in the Ethereum ecosystem which may provide ongoing marketing and amplification value to the Company's Treasury Strategy.

At closing, Etherealize and a consortium of leading DeFi builders will act as a DeFi Council to offer input to the Company on how it may use its treasury to generate outsized yield while also benefiting the Ethereum ecosystem. The DeFi Council team members bring extensive experience as the creators of many of the critical DeFi protocols in use today.

With the altcoin market heating up, thanks to rising prices of heavyweights like Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana, retail investors are once again on the hunt for the next big altcoin.

One tool that's quickly gaining popularity is Gemini, Google's AI assistant. Thanks to its proximity to Google's vast index, Gemini has become a go-to resource for identifying the best altcoins to buy.

After all, Gemini is capable of scanning the internet, pulling insights from traders, and corroborating multiple data points from a wide range of sources, which gives it a uniquely broad and fast-evolving view of the market.

That said, there's still a compelling case for human analysts when it comes to understanding crypto markets.

The best analysts have verifiable track records, regularly share their findings on platforms like X and Reddit, and can explain their picks with a level of nuance and intuition that AI hasn't quite matched yet.

Still, we were curious: how would Gemini fare if we stacked it against the top crypto analysts?

So, we put it to the test. And after combing through its latest recommendations, we can confidently say that Gemini passed with flying colors. Here are the altcoins that made the cut.

Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) could easily be among the next cryptos to explode, thanks to its mission to supercharge the Bitcoin ecosystem with Solana-like performance and Web3 compatibility.

By integrating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), $HYPER's new Layer 2 will set the stage for cutting-edge dApps to be developed and maintained right on Bitcoin.

Additionally, it will use a decentralized, non-custodial canonical bridge to let users convert their $BTC into ‘wrapped' $BTC.



These Layer 2-compatible tokens can then be used to engage in high-speed DeFi trading, lending, staking, and swapping protocols, NFT marketplaces, and blockchain-based gaming dApps, among other uses.

The best part? Bitcoin Hyper is currently in presale, meaning you can buy it for a super-low price of $0.01245. And the project has in total raised over $5.6M so far.

According to our $HYPER price prediction, the token could surge by up to 1,500% and reach $0.20 by the end of 2026. Here's how to buy it.

Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the native cryptocurrency of Best Wallet, currently the only wallet to let you buy the best crypto presales directly within the app.

It's also non-custodial, meaning you get total control over your private keys, no more relying on third parties that can be hacked or go out of business.

Combined with rock-solid MFA options, including biometric authentication, advanced cryptography, and even crypto insurance, Best Wallet ensures your digital assets remain secure from unauthorized access.

Best Wallet is on track to capture over 40% of the entire non-custodial crypto wallet market by 2027, and you can become part of this growth by buying $BEST.



In addition to potentially making over 2,300% in the next year or so, buying and holding $BEST unlocks a slew of exclusive perks.

These include discounted trading and gas fees, access to voting rights and generous staking rewards (currently yielding 94%), and early-bird access to new meme coins on presale.

One $BEST is currently available for just $0.025405, and the project has so far amassed a whopping $14.3M. Here's how to buy it.

The viral Pepe the Frog has spawned countless meme clones in recent months, but few have made waves like Pepecoin ($PEP).

It's one of the top-trending cryptos right now, having surged over 135% in just the past seven days.

What sets $PEP apart is its own proof-of-work blockchain. That's right; it's not an ERC-20 or BNB-based token, but a fully independent chain.

It aims to be more than just a joke, delivering a secure, censorship-resistant currency while embracing a fun, community-first ethos.



Pepecoin also features a functional wallet ecosystem, and its mission is simple: to offer digital money that's open-source, permissionless, and truly run by the community.

This makes it one of the very few top meme coins that take decentralization seriously, echoing the grassroots ideals of Bitcoin itself.

At the time of writing, $PEP has gone slightly sideways, but given that its newfound momentum could rocket it to the moon in the coming weeks, its current price of $0.00059 seems like a solid entry point.

Savvy investors are turning to cutting-edge AI tools like Gemini to get a read on the ever-changing altcoin market, and potentially spot explosive tokens like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and Best Wallet Token ($BEST) before they blast off.

That said, it's important to remember that even the smartest AI models can make mistakes, so their insights should always be taken with a grain of salt.

And, of course, none of this is financial advice. Always do your own research before making any investment decisions.

				Last Updated:				July 29, 2025			

The crypto market took a mild hit today, with total capitalisation falling by 2% to $3.91 trillion. The market may face increased volatility ahead of the FOMC meeting later today, as investors await key signals from the Federal Reserve. With the CME FedWatch Tool showing a 96.9% probability that interest rates will remain unchanged, most expect a pause rather than a pivot. Bitcoin price remained relatively steady, trading between $118,000 and $119,000 after recovering from a drop to $115,000.

Ethereum, however, continues to hold strong above $3,700, bolstered by a record $5.2 billion in net inflows into spot ETH ETFs. Clearly, we're seeing a rotation from Bitcoin into altcoins, at least for now, so what are the best altcoins to buy in anticipation of a possible altcoin season?

EXPLORE: Best New Cryptocurrencies to Invest in 2025

ETH ETFs saw $65.14 million in inflows, with BlackRock's ETHA leading the charge at $131.95 million. ETH ETFs now hold $21.5 billion in assets and are becoming an increasingly important part of the altcoin landscape.

Corporate treasuries are now accumulating ETH, with firms like SharpLink Gaming surpassing the Ethereum Foundation's holdings. Over $1.6 billion in ETH has been acquired by major corporations in the past month, suggesting long-term conviction.

$ETH ETF inflows are absolutely skyrocketing right now.

Ethereum remains the leading altcoin and a key signal for broader market trends. With spot ETH ETFs now logging 17 consecutive days of inflows totaling $5.2 billion, institutional confidence is surging. ETH/BTC technicals have flipped bullish, and analysts increasingly view Ethereum as the foundation of the next crypto cycle.



(ETHUSDT)

Ethereum is approaching key resistance at $4,069 after a strong rally from below $2,400. A breakout could target $4,500–$5,000, supported by record ETF inflows. The structure favors bulls, but confirmation is needed above this level to sustain momentum. A new ETH ATH could kickstart the highly awaited altcoin season.

At the same time, Hyperliquid (HYPE) is also making numbers. Built on a custom Layer 1 optimized for high-speed, on-chain perpetuals, it offers gasless, low-latency execution and deep order books.

As traders seek alternatives to centralized exchanges, Hyperliquid's blend of performance and transparency positions it as a top choice for advanced users. Its rapid growth and strong developer activity make it a key altcoin to watch. Currently trading at $43,93, HYPE could be aiming for the $100 target next.

Solana, meanwhile, has regained momentum after past network issues. With fast transactions and minimal fees, it's once again a hub for DeFi, NFTs, and tokenized assets. Upgrades like Firedancer have boosted reliability, while rising user activity and institutional interest support continued upside. SOL remains a leading Layer 1 with long-term growth potential.

SharpLink (SBET) Boosts Ethereum Holdings to 438K ETH, Stakes Over 700 ETH


 
				By  Fatima



SharpLink (SBET), the self-proclaimed “MicroStrategy for Ethereum,” has grown its ETH reserves to approximately 438,190 ETH: valued at around $1.68 billion. Between July 21 and 27 alone, the firm acquired roughly 77,210 ETH for $290 million at an average price of $3,756.
This marks a major step in SharpLink's aggressive ETH treasury strategy, which began on June 2. Since then, the company's ETH-per-share ratio, dubbed “ETH Concentration”, has surged from 2.00 to 3.40, up 70% in under two months. Just last week, that figure stood at 3.06.
Beyond accumulation, SharpLink is also earning through staking. Cumulative staking rewards have reached approximately 722 ETH, further boosting its ETH position.

Vine Crypto Still On A Rally: Elon Musk Is “Bringing Vine Back”


 
				By  Fatima



Vine Crypto (VINE), a meme token launched on Solana earlier this year, saw a sharp uptick over the weekend, climbing 2.18% to trade at $0.1407. That might sound modest, but over the last two weeks, VINE has surged more than 246% and over 500% this month alone.
Remember Vine? The first edition of TikTok that literally damages people's reward paths in their brains. Vine was shut down for a reason, despite being profitable. Now it might be back baby!
All the momentum for the vine traces back to one man: Elon Musk. On July 24, Musk tweeted, “We're bringing back Vine, but in AI form,” triggering a massive rally and renewed interest in anything associated with the platform.

Whales Grab ETH as Galaxy Digital Dumps More Bitcoin: Is the Rotation Underway?


 
				By  Fatima



As Ethereum ETFs surge and whale wallets continue to snap up ETH, Bitcoin is facing renewed selling pressure from major players. Today, blockchain investigators at Lookonchain reported a new transfer of 3,782 BTC, worth approximately $447 million, from wallets linked to Galaxy Digital to exchanges. This follows Galaxy's massive $9 billion BTC sale last week, executed on behalf of a Satoshi-era whale.
That historic transaction involved over 80,000 BTC and was reportedly part of an estate planning strategy. Most of the coins were sold via OTC and secondary markets, limiting the immediate impact on price. But with over $400 million now on the move, the market is bracing for a possible continuation of the sell-off.
Despite the dumping, Bitcoin remains surprisingly stable, trading around $118,944 at press time. ETF inflows appear to be cushioning the impact, with $157 million returning to BTC funds in the latest session (Coinglass).
Bitcoin Whales Dump, But Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) Rockets With $400K Weekend Raise
As Galaxy Digital offloads billions in BTC and wallet-linked activity hints at more sell pressure, Bitcoin's price remains surprisingly stable, hovering just 3% from its all-time high. Yet, the real action this week is also happening outside traditional markets.
Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), a Bitcoin Layer 2 project, raised $400,000 over the weekend and the presale collected so far over $5.6 million.
With over $5.6 million raised, Bitcoin Hyper is gaining momentum fast. HYPER focus on speed, promising real rollups, a canonical BTC bridge, and near-instant settlement. Some analysts say it could be the next 100x presale.
Experts still believe Bitcoin is on track to reach $150,000 or higher this cycle. At this pace, the broader BTC ecosystem is expected to grow exponentially, and Bitcoin Hyper is positioning itself at the forefront of that momentum.

China Industrial Bank Fast-Tracks AI Stablecoin to Counter Dollar


 
				By  Fatima



China Industrial Bank (CIB) is stepping up its digital game with plans for an AI-enchanced stablecoin, aiming to push itself from the US dollar's grip on global finance. This move forms part of its wider digital-to-smart bank transformation strategy.
The initiative reflects a calculated response to growing stablecoin adoption and evolving regulatory frameworks like the US GENIUS Act. While the AI angle remains mysterious, the project signals China's intensifying ambition to build tech-forward financial tools with global reach.

World Liberty and New Wallets Snap Up Over $2.7B in Ethereum Since July


 
				By  Fatima



ETH accumulation continues. Trump's World Liberty recently spent 1 million USDC to buy 256.75 ETH at a price of $3,895 about 24 hours ago.
So far, World Liberty has accumulated a total of 77,226 ETH, valued at around $296 million, with an average purchase price of $3,294. This position currently shows an unrealized profit of approximately $41.7 million.
In addition, a new wallet (0x286f) added another 12,749 ETH, worth about $48 million, 12 hours ago.
Since July 9, nine new wallets have collectively bought 628,646 ETH, totaling around $2.38 billion. This significant accumulation signals strong interest and confidence in Ethereum from fresh investors and large buyers.

Bitcoin ETFs have officially shattered records, surpassing $50 billion in cumulative inflows and reinforcing Bitcoin's position as an institutional-grade asset. July alone contributed more than $1.5 billion in net inflows, with BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) leading the charge at over $87 billion in assets under management.

The milestone triggered a massive short squeeze, wiping out $415 million in bearish positions within 24 hours as traders scrambled to cover bets. This sharp reversal underscores the growing dominance of ETF-driven liquidity and the resilience of Bitcoin as a macro investment vehicle.

However, cracks in Bitcoin's absolute dominance are starting to show.

Over the past week, Ethereum ETFs have seen consecutive inflows, which were up to $332 million over two days, while Bitcoin ETFs recorded their largest two-day outflow in months. This trend signals a structural rotation into Ethereum and select altcoins, as investors diversify from the market leader into assets with higher utility potential and growth narratives.

With this shift, early-stage Web3 projects are coming into focus, especially those offering real-world use cases like gaming and DeFi. Tapzi, a skill-based Web3 gaming platform, fits squarely into this trend as capital looks beyond Bitcoin for innovative, utility-driven ecosystems poised for long-term adoption.

There are more such top undervalued altcoins to buy now that can help you diversify your portfolio, and let's check the details!

Below-mentioned is a list of the top undervalued altcoins to buy now:

While earlier Bitcoin ETFs surged high and now the market transitioned towards Ethereum ETFs, the capital rotation is creating a stir amongst amateur investors. Yet, crypto whales are seizing the opportunity to grab the top undervalued altcoins to buy now to capitalize early! Let's know what they have to offer!

Tapzi is emerging as a notable entrant in the Web3 gaming sector at a time when capital rotation from Bitcoin into altcoins is accelerating. With institutional investors diversifying into assets offering real utility, platforms like Tapzi aim to capture attention by addressing the shortcomings of traditional GameFi models.

Unlike speculative play-to-earn ecosystems that often face inflationary pressures, Tapzi focuses on skill-based Player-versus-Player (PvP) gaming, creating an economy rooted in competition and fair play.

The project is structured around a phased roadmap, starting with a presale in Q3 2025 alongside a playable beta featuring classic games such as Chess and Checkers. By Q4 2025, Tapzi plans to roll out its mainnet platform, introduce staking features, and host its first global tournament, positioning itself for early user acquisition.

Future phases include NFT-based cosmetic customization, a developer SDK for third-party game integration, and cross-chain deployments to networks like Ethereum and Polygon, supporting scalability for over 100,000 daily active users. The TAPZI token underpins this ecosystem through staking, prize pools, NFT purchases, and potential governance rights.

With Web3 gaming projected to grow at a CAGR of over 68% by 2030, Tapzi offers an example of how early investment in skill-driven gaming platforms can align with broader market trends favoring utility and sustainability.

Sui is an advanced Layer-1 blockchain designed to deliver scalability and low-latency performance for the next generation of decentralized applications.

Developed by former Meta engineers at Mysten Labs, Sui uses a unique object-centric data model and parallel transaction execution, enabling unmatched throughput without compromising security. This architecture allows Sui to achieve near-instant finality, making it ideal for real-world use cases such as gaming, DeFi, and NFT marketplaces.

The native token, SUI, powers gas fees, staking, and governance, creating a sustainable economic model. Sui also supports developers through its Move programming language, which prioritizes safety and flexibility in smart contract development. As institutional interest in blockchain infrastructure rises and Layer-1 networks compete for dominance, Sui stands out for its technical innovation and enterprise-ready design.

With growing partnerships and a rapidly expanding ecosystem, it positions itself as a key player for Web3 scalability. For investors, SUI offers exposure to a next-gen chain that aligns with the future of high-performance decentralized applications.

Bitget Token is the native utility token of the Bitget exchange, one of the fastest-growing global crypto trading platforms. BGB serves multiple roles within the ecosystem, including fee discounts, exclusive access to token launches, and participation in staking programs.

With Bitget consistently ranking among the top exchanges by derivatives volume, BGB's utility expands in tandem with the platform's growth.

The token also powers Bitget's launchpad, allowing early investors to gain entry into promising presale projects, adding to its real-world relevance. Additionally, holders benefit from a tiered loyalty system and VIP trading privileges, making BGB attractive for both retail and institutional users.

Amid a market trend where exchange tokens like BNB and OKB have demonstrated strong long-term performance, BGB is gaining traction as an undervalued asset. With Bitget's global expansion, robust security measures, and increasing user adoption, BGB stands out as a practical and strategic play for those seeking utility-driven growth in 2025.

Mantle is a next-generation Layer-2 scaling solution built on Ethereum, designed to enhance transaction efficiency without sacrificing security. Powered by an optimistic rollup framework, Mantle dramatically reduces gas costs while maintaining EVM compatibility, making it an ideal environment for developers and DeFi protocols.

What sets Mantle apart is its modular architecture and strong governance model backed by the BitDAO ecosystem, one of the largest decentralized treasuries in crypto. The native token, MNT, underpins network security, governance, and staking incentives, creating a robust economic foundation for growth.

As Ethereum activity surges following ETF inflows, the demand for Layer-2 solutions is expected to spike, positioning Mantle as a prime beneficiary. With partnerships across DeFi, GameFi, and institutional-grade applications, MNT offers both technical scalability and real-world adoption potential.

For investors seeking exposure to Ethereum's scaling narrative, Mantle presents an undervalued opportunity aligned with the industry's long-term direction.

VeChain remains one of the most practical blockchain solutions for enterprise adoption, focusing on supply chain transparency, data integrity, and sustainability. Its dual-token system, like VET for value transfer and VTHO for transaction fees, ensures cost predictability and scalability, making it suitable for global businesses.

VeChain's partnerships with industry leaders such as BMW, PwC, and Walmart China underscore its ability to deliver real-world solutions, from product authentication to carbon footprint tracking. As ESG compliance becomes a global priority, VeChain's blockchain-powered traceability tools position it as a key player in green and transparent supply chains.

Despite its strong fundamentals and long-term partnerships, VET remains undervalued compared to its enterprise-grade use cases. With increasing government interest in blockchain for compliance and sustainability, VeChain is poised to capture significant institutional and retail attention.

For investors seeking utility-driven assets beyond speculation, VET represents one of the most grounded opportunities in the current market.

The recent surge in ETF inflows and Bitcoin's dominance is creating a unique opportunity for altcoins with real-world utility and robust fundamentals.

As the market prepares for the next rotation, undervalued assets like Sui, Mantle, VeChain, and Bitget Token stand out for their scalability, enterprise adoption, and strong ecosystems. These projects are tangible solutions addressing blockchain's most pressing challenges, from interoperability to institutional-grade performance.

While these assets look promising, early-stage tokens like Tapzi, which is a Web3 skill-based gaming protocol, are also gaining traction for aligning with Ethereum's expanding institutional narrative. For strategic investors, diversifying into both established and emerging projects will unlock the next wave of high-growth opportunities.

              Highlights            



                        SoFi reported a record-breaking second quarter, adding 850,000 new members and 1.26 million new products with 44% year-over-year adjusted net revenue growth and increased financial guidance for 2025.                      


                        SoFi is doubling down on blockchain (launching instant international transfers, reentering crypto, and exploring stablecoins and crypto-backed loans) and AI (automating fraud detection and launching financial coach tools).                      


                        From home equity and student loans to FinTech infrastructure via Galileo and Technisys, SoFi's growth roadmap combines banking, tech and B2B services with a low-cost, high-lifetime value user acquisition model.

While headlines can often spotlight layoffs and down rounds, SoFi's second-quarter 2025 earnings call Tuesday (July 29) saw executives share a different story with investors, one not only showcasing a company firing on all cylinders, but also serving as a potential bellwether for the broader direction of digital finance.

A record 850,000 new members joined SoFi in the quarter, up 34% from the prior year to 11.7 million, according to an earnings press release. The company also added a record 1.26 million new products, up 34% from the prior year, to 17.1 million products.

“We had an exceptional second quarter, driving durable growth and strong returns through our relentless focus on product innovation and brand building,” SoFi CEO Anthony Noto said in the release. “We accelerated adjusted net revenue growth to 44% year over year, the highest level in over two years, driven by record high new members, as well as new products, and an increase in fee-based revenue… Looking forward, we are focusing on innovating faster than ever before to serve more of our members' needs and increasing our financial guidance for 2025.”

Once known simply for student loan refinancing, SoFi has focused on transitioning into a digitally native financial services player, pursuing the ambition to be a “one-stop shop” for its members, per the release. It could signal an emerging recalibration of what it means to be a financial institution in a post-bank branch world.

“We are not just a bank, and not just a tech company — we're a little bit of both,” Noto told investors during the call.

The company's share price was up double-digits on the back of the earnings results.

While traditional banks tiptoe around blockchain, SoFi is sprinting into the space. This year, it will launch blockchain-powered international money transfers — self-serve, 24/7 and completed in under a minute. Think Western Union meets decentralized finance (DeFi).

SoFi is also reentering cryptocurrency trading, a service it previously paused amid regulatory headwinds. Now, with a federal bank license in hand and new regulations under the GENIUS Act opening the door, SoFi said it has a structural advantage over pure-play crypto platforms.

During the call, Noto teased plans including stablecoin issuance, crypto-backed loans and staking infrastructure for other financial institutions. SoFi is already staffing up with engineering talent and positioning itself as a key player in financial Web3.

AI is another frontier. The company has rolled out machine learning tools to automate dispute resolutions, detect fraud and launch “Cash Coach,” an AI advisor that helps users optimize cash holdings across accounts. Expect a fleet of “coaches” soon, spanning spending, saving, investing and more.

That doesn't mean the company is neglecting its traditional foundation. Personal loan originations increased nearly 66% year over year to $7 billion, and despite industry headwinds, SoFi's home lending segment saw 92% year-over-year growth in Q2, reaching $799 million in originations. A big driver was home equity loans, which now make up a third of volume — a product SoFi didn't even offer a year ago.

Meanwhile, student loans are recovering. Originations hit nearly $1 billion, up 35% from last year, buoyed by a new refinancing solution that steps up payments over time. SoFi sees tailwinds ahead from the elimination of certain federal programs like Grad PLUS, which may force more students into private options.

The company's services segment, anchored by Galileo and Technisys, grew net revenue 15% year over year to $109.8 million with a steady 30% contribution margin. Accounts on the platform rose by 2 million, quarter over quarter, to 160 million.

If there's a threat to SoFi's growth, it's not competition — it's capacity.

“Our biggest challenge is deciding what not to do,” Noto said during the call.

From crypto and AI to stablecoins and tokenized loans, SoFi sees more opportunity than it can reasonably chase in parallel.

The company raised its full-year 2025 guidance, now projecting $3.375 billion in adjusted net revenue (up from $3.31 billion) and $960 million in adjusted EBITDA.

At the same time, lifetime value efficiency has become the cornerstone of SoFi's flywheel strategy.

“It costs less than $15 to acquire a SoFi Relay user,” Noto said during the call, referencing the free financial dashboard tool that often serves as a gateway into the SoFi ecosystem.

From there, users often graduate to direct deposit, high-yield savings, investing and personal loans. A single user can generate more than $1,800 in variable profit from one loan alone — not counting additional products or lifetime value.

D-Wave Quantum's QBTS increasing emphasis on artificial intelligence and blockchain represents a strategic expansion of its quantum system sales pipeline. The company in the first quarter of 2025 introduced a quantum-powered blockchain architecture designed for scalable, energy-efficient applications, a compelling differentiator in an industry grappling with the environmental impact of traditional blockchain models.

Additionally, the launch of a PyTorch-integrated quantum AI toolkit marked a significant step toward making quantum computing more accessible for machine learning developers and data scientists, particularly those working on hybrid classical-quantum workflows.

D-Wave's management in this regard noted that, while still early-stage, these developments are closely aligned with system sales opportunities rather than the company's Quantum Computing-as-a-Service (QCAAS) segment. According to D-Wave, such innovations are geared toward customers seeking to deploy their own on-premises systems for high-security, high-throughput use cases, including blockchain and advanced AI modeling. The company suggested that this integration of quantum capabilities into real-world development ecosystems could open the door for commercial traction across both enterprise and government verticals.

D-Wave's current focus on partner discussions and proof-of-concept (POC) pilots around its blockchain framework and PyTorch-integrated AI toolkit could pave the way for future system sales or licensing deals. As second-quarter 2025 earnings approach, attention will be on whether these early-stage efforts have translated into commercial traction.

Shares of QBTS have jumped nearly 166% in the past three months.

Three-Month Price Performance

Diverging Paths Among Quantum Computing Rivals

IonQ IONQ: It is advancing in quantum AI through its gate-based architecture, focusing on hybrid AI model training and partnerships with cloud providers. While strong in developer tooling and quantum machine learning, IonQ is yet to introduce a blockchain framework like QBTS, leaving a potential gap in its emerging markets strategy.

Rigetti Computing RGTI: The company remains hardware-focused, prioritizing qubit fidelity and government contracts via its QCS platform. Though exploring AI, it lacks blockchain-specific initiatives and domain toolkits like D-Wave's PyTorch integration, making its approach more tech-centric and less diversified across emerging commercial applications.

Average Target Price for QBTS Suggests Limited Upside

Based on short-term price targets offered by eight analysts, D-Wave Quantum's average price target represents a decline of 8.6% from the last closing price of $17.25.

D-Wave Quantum currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Digital trading platform eToro (ETOR) shared plans on Tuesday to tokenized U.S-listed equities on the Ethereum blockchain, joining rivals to move towards blockchain-based marketplaces.

The ERC-20 tokens will represent the underlying shares held on eToro and can be redeemed back into traditional stock holdings, according to the press release. The company said the aim is to make equities tradable on-chain and compatible with decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, opening the door to around-the-clock market access.

""Our goal is to tokenize every asset on eToro – starting with stocks – enabling our users to move tokenized assets onto the blockchain and from there integrate them into the broader DeFi ecosystem,"" CEO Yoni Assia said in a statement. ""

He said that new crypto regulations like MiCA in Europe and the stablecoin-focused Genius Act in the U.S. ""makes the tokenization of real-world assets a new opportunity to create digital assets that are legally backed and regulated.""

The move will put eToro alongside a growing roster of trading venues that recently introduced tokenized equities. Competitor Robinhood announced its stock token trading for European users last month, while several crypto exchanges including Kraken, Gemini, Bybit also debuted similar features.

EToro said its tokenized stock offering build on past experiences in tokenization,  acquiring Danish token startup Firmo in 2019 and launching tokenized gold and silver.

Zug, Switzerland, July 29th, 2025, Chainwire



Ika, the pioneering blockchain infrastructure provider, has officially launched its mainnet, marking a significant milestone in blockchain interoperability. The launch introduces the first-ever zero-trust multiparty computation (MPC) network capable of native cross-chain asset control directly from smart contracts on the Sui blockchain.

Ika's protocol allows Sui-based smart contracts to securely and seamlessly manage native assets across many blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and modern L1s and L2s, without relying on bridges, token wrapping, or trusted third parties. This breakthrough eliminates common risks associated with cross-chain solutions, such as vulnerabilities inherent in bridging protocols or wrapped tokens, fundamentally transforming blockchain interoperability.

At the heart of Ika's innovation is the introduction of dWallets, a decentralized, programmable, and transferable signing mechanism. dWallets enable both the user and the Ika network to collaboratively sign transactions, while enforcing logic governed by smart contracts. This empowers developers and institutions to build and operate securely across various blockchains with native asset control.

The technological core of Ika is its novel 2PC-MPC cryptography protocol, previously thought impractical for decentralized environments due to latency, scalability, and security constraints. Ika has overcome these hurdles, delivering sub-second latency and linear scalability, without compromising on decentralization, delivering a network that can be supported by hundreds of operators globally. Each operation includes cryptographic safeguards that require explicit user participation, supporting a zero-trust security framework.

The network's native token, IKA, plays a critical role by securing the infrastructure through a decentralized, permissionless proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. IKA tokens are integral for transaction fees, spam prevention, rewarding reliable operators, and network governance.

Several leading blockchain projects on Sui are already utilizing Ika's mainnet, demonstrating the protocol's versatility and robustness:

“Today marks the start of a new era in blockchain interoperability,” said Ika Co-Founder Omer Sadika. “Our mainnet launch is not just a technological milestone, but a paradigm shift, bringing native Zero-Trust interoperability to Sui , and unlocking unprecedented possibilities for developers, institutions, and individual users alike.”

With Ika now live, blockchain projects, financial institutions, and developers can deploy multi-chain applications on Sui, operate as network participants, or engage with the Ika network.

For further information, users can visit https://ika.xyz or follow Ika on X.

About Ika

Ika is the fastest parallel MPC network, offering sub-second latency, unprecedented scale and decentralization, and zero-trust security. As the premier choice for interoperability, decentralized custody, and chain abstraction, Ika is set to revolutionize digital asset security and multi-chain DeFi. Users can learn more here

CryptoPunks Rally Past $200K Floor for First Time in Over a Year Amid NFT Rebound

Markets

CryptoPunks, the 10,000-piece pixel-art NFT collection launched on Ethereum in 2017, is gaining momentum once again as its floor price swells.

The minimum amount people can buy into the collection has been steadily rising since August of last year, up from 20.45 ETH to 53.98 ETH—a 163% gain.

With the price of Ethereum around $3,745, CryptoPunks' floor price hovers just above $200,000. That's the highest it's been since March 8, 2024.

The uplift follows a major sweep last week, when an unknown user purchased 45 Crypto Punks in a single go. Sweeping, in the context of NFTs, refers to a strategy that involves purchasing a substantial number of NFTs from a particular collection.

Beeple, a digital artist known for selling an NFT artwork for $69 million via Christie's back in 2021, dedicated the “BIG SWEEP” artwork last week in response to the purchase.

The surge also follows the busiest day for Ethereum NFTs since February. On July 20, trading volume reached $26 million, followed by $24.9 million on July 21, according to data from Dragonfly's Hildebert Moulié. 

More than half of that volume came from CryptoPunks.app, the collection's official marketplace.

Strategic purchases by major holders, including multi-million-dollar acquisitions and targeted buys of traits such as “hoodie” Punks, hint at renewed interest in NFTs, despite the sector never having fully recovered from the lofty heights witnessed during the previous bull run.

Yet a weaker U.S. dollar, driven by volatile macroeconomic conditions, has lifted the dollar-denominated value of Bitcoin and Ethereum. 

Because CryptoPunks are priced in Ethereum, gains in the crypto have translated into a higher floor price and market capitalization when measured in dollars.

The total NFT market capitalization soared from $3.6 billion at the start of July to $6.8 billion, CoinGecko data shows. Historically, a strong Ethereum performance has correlated with a positive uplift for high-profile NFT collections built on its blockchain.

Crypto Punks, meanwhile, have dominated the lending platform Gondi, “with over $21 million in active loans, showing they remain one of the most trusted forms of NFT collateral,” according to research in May from Dapp Radar analyst Sara Gherghelas.

Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana, has stirred intense debate within the crypto community after branding NFTs and meme coins as “digital slop with no intrinsic value.”

In a post on X, Yakovenko compared the booming NFT and memecoin sectors to mobile game loot boxes, implying that consumer spending doesn't equate to actual worth.

The remark was especially controversial given that Solana has become one of the leading networks for NFT activity and meme coin launches. The blockchain processed over $431 billion in transactions and boasts a meme coin market exceeding $15 billion as of July 2025.

Crypto influencers were quick to react. Adam Hollander, CMO at OpenSea, called Yakovenko's take “disappointing and flat-out wrong,” emphasizing the value of digital ownership.

Others defended NFTs as part of the multi-trillion-dollar entertainment industry, citing emotional and cultural relevance even in the absence of utility.

Despite the pushback, Yakovenko doubled down, stressing that his main concern is market integrity: “What's important to me is that the shitheads that obfuscate or mislead about market conditions or market structure are nuked from orbit.”

The irony of Yakovenko's statement lies in Solana's success, which is largely fueled by the very sectors he criticized. Meme coins like BONK, DOGWIFHAT, and Fartcoin collectively account for billions in market capitalization. BONK alone saw a 50.4% weekly gain and was recently added to Grayscale's Q3 watchlist.

The NFT space on Solana has also surged, with trading volume jumping 94% to $6.6 billion in July. Collections like DeGods and Solana Monkey Business continue to dominate, mostly traded via Magic Eden, which holds a 90% share of Solana's NFT market.

While Yakovenko's blunt critique aims to provoke a conversation around transparency and long-term value, it has clearly clashed with Solana's current identity, one built on speed, affordability, and yes, meme coin mania.

So the NFT market is heating up again, huh? CryptoPunks are back on the rise folks! The floor price is over $205,000, which is insane especially since we haven't really seen this kind of interest lately. This skyrocketing floor price probably has most of us wondering if crypto payroll is not too far behind. Is this the return of the NFT era?  And what does it mean for companies that are trying to integrate cryptocurrency payments into their business models? 

Let's break down what's going on in the NFT space, the part institutional investments play, and possible strategies moving forward.

On July 29th, CryptoPunks celebrated a massive milestone with their floor price hitting 53.85 ETH - now that's over $205,000. Now there's 10,000 unique pixel-art collectibles that launched on Ethereum back in 2017, and the current market cap of these things is just staggering. Over 538,177 ETH is tied up in these CryptoPunks, with a 24-hour trading volume of 2.220 ETH, which is up nearly 330% compared to before. 

The last time we saw something like this was in March 2024, so the interest is definitely coming back. This can be attributed to the rising price of Ethereum, which recently shot up by 60% in just a month.

These figures don't lie. I think this uptick in crypto payroll is signaling a shift from speculation toward actual, real-world use cases. Now don't get me wrong, the NFT space has to start making things that people actually want to use. But if you think about it, this could mean less concentrated wealth in the space and more opportunities for other people, particularly if companies double-down on offering useful, sustainable services.  

For fintech companies, this could be a huge chance to innovate in the crypto payroll world where utility is king. With the right focus, they can create value for customers and build trust in the long run.

What's also pretty fascinating is how institutional interest is affecting the NFT landscape. Major companies, think Starbucks and Salesforce, are now employing NFTs to better reach customers. This could really enhance customer loyalty, which is a positive angle for these digital assets.  

Look, we could be seeing major institutional players driving value and changing the entire digital ownership model we thought we knew. And since NFTs will allow fractional ownership, that means more people can invest in things that were once reserved for the mega-wealthy. 

If you're a fintech company looking to capitalize on this, things are going to be tricky. But here are a few possible strategies:  

Risk Management: Robust risk management and diversification strategies are crucial. With NFTs being so up and down, have a mix of assets and use AI to help manage your risk.

Focus on Utility: Build NFT products that can be useful. Crypto payroll, decentralized finance, things that pay off in the real world, ya know?

Regulation is key: The landscape isn't stable, so keep an eye on regulations and make sure you're compliant.

Partnerships: Engage with established financial institutions that can help you with efficiency and security.

Tech: Be on the cutting edge of technology, whether that's blockchain or AI - things are moving fast!

Inclusion is Everything: Focus on financial inclusion, especially if it opens opportunities for underbanked populations.

At the end of the day, the NFT market is coming out of hibernation, and the CryptoPunks revival is leading the way. Institutional interest is shaping this landscape, which puts fintech companies in an interesting position. If they're smart, they'll adapt and create what people really want in a market that's not as crazy as it used to be. The future of NFTs and crypto payroll looks promising—but only for those who are ready for it.

GameSquare Holdings, Inc. has drawn attention by acquiring CryptoPunk #5577, a well-known NFT, for $5.15 million through preferred shares. Following the deal, CryptoPunk #5577 officially became a strategic treasury asset of GameSquare.

While NFTs have long been speculative digital collectibles, a new wave of companies treating them as treasury assets may redefine their role in corporate finance, if the market holds.

GameSquare's decision is bold. It places NFTs on the same level as other recent reserve crypto assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.

Garga, CEO of Yuga Labs — the company behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection — predicted that NFT treasury companies will become a trend. He also expressed a desire to see an APE-focused treasury company.

“The world isn't ready for NFT treasury companies, but they are coming anyway,” Garga said.

Matt Medved, a member of the Digital Art Council at Art Basel, echoed his expectations. Medved believes the NFT market cap is small but still has massive growth potential. Other NFT investors also argue that NFTs hold a unique advantage — their strong cultural and social elements.

“But I think there's way more to it. This won't be just a cold finance strategy like what Michael Saylor is doing. It will involve real social dynamics,” NFT investor Loki said.

Notably, the market is witnessing a sharp rise in NFT trading volume in July. A recent report from BeInCrypto noted that the floor prices of CryptoPunks and Moonbirds have surged, signaling a potential comeback of the NFT season.

According to data from Dune, NFT marketplace volumes exploded in July. On some days, trading volume reached $26 million, with the daily average above $10 million.

Additionally, Nathan Frankovitz — an analyst at VanEck — cited data from CryptoSlam, noting that Ethereum NFT trading volume on July 23 spiked to the highest level since May 2022.

This data shows renewed interest in NFTs, creating favorable conditions for businesses to consider these assets as part of their strategic reserves.

GameSquare may be the first signal, but it's still too early to call it a full-blown trend.

If this movement gains momentum, the most promising NFT collections likely to benefit would include Pudgy Penguins, CryptoPunks, and Bored Ape Yacht Club. According to OpenSea, these collections account for most of the liquidity in the NFT market.

Even though NFT industry leaders believe that NFT treasury companies could revolutionize corporate finance — similar to how MicroStrategy used Bitcoin — the intrinsic value of NFTs remains hotly debated, even within the crypto sector.

Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana, bluntly criticized NFTs and memecoins in a recent discussion on X (formerly Twitter).

“I've said this for years. Memecoins and NFTs are digital slop and have no intrinsic value. Like a mobile game loot box. People spend $150B a year on mobile gaming,” Yakovenko said.

Skepticism goes beyond NFTs themselves. Using crypto as a strategic reserve has faced doubt since its early days.

Like Bitcoin-reserve companies, NFT treasury firms could issue bonds to purchase NFTs, inflating NFT and stock values. Then, retail investors would buy shares in companies holding high-value NFT portfolios. Those companies would recycle that capital. The cycle could break if capital inflows weaken and NFT prices crash.

Therefore, assets used for strategic reserves must demonstrate sustainable growth. Historically, this is where NFTs fundamentally differ from Bitcoin.

 People in the cryptosphere need to stop slapping the word “truth” on whitepapers that read like AI fanfic – there's only one project that deserves it: TOKEN6900 (T6900). 

And the truth is, it's raised over $1.3 million in its ICO without offering a morsel of utility or a single plan of action.

What it does have is a credo that's brutally honest about what it is: a meme coin. A meme coin that doesn't mint tokens behind your back – and won't, no matter what happens. A project that doesn't need “personality traits” like ChatGPT will eventually roll out, because TOKEN6900 already has a personality baked in: effortlessly unserious, terminally online, and dangerously chill.

That's the cold hard truth about TOKEN6900. And those who understand it are already tuned into Channel 69, the only broadcast worth watching this cycle.

And in less than 24 hours, the $0.00675 presale price per T6900 disappears. After that? A higher price per token. If it touches $0.0069, don't be surprised when meme rapture hits the chain.

The world is getting more delusional by the day as the fiscal taps stay wide open, with U.S. President Donald Trump still trying to axe Fed Chair Jerome Powell.

The irony? He recently questioned who put Powell in charge, conveniently forgetting that he nominated him during his first term. That's why the tension was so thick when Trump toured the $2.5 billion refurbishment of the central bank last week.

https://twitter.com/factpostnews/status/1945516097198854415

On Sunday, the White House pushed for “dramatically lower rates” ahead of Wednesday's Fed meeting – and the entire market is watching to see if Powell bends or holds the line.

Billionaire Ray Dalio, on the other hand, sees it differently. To him, the U.S. is staring down an accelerating debt burden and long-term currency devaluation. In a recent podcast, he recommended allocating 15% to Bitcoin (BTC) and gold – a massive leap from his 2022 guidance of just 1.5%.

Ray Dalio suggests putting 15% in #Bitcoin, #gold amid US ‘debt doom loop': CointelegraphBillionaire hedge fund manager Ray Dalio recommended a 15% portfolio allocation to Bitcoin or gold for optimal ""return-to-risk ratio"" amid America's debt crisis, during an appearance on the… pic.twitter.com/O2wFz9eV5V

— CN Wire (@Sino_Market) July 29, 2025



It's a reality check from the former boss of the world's biggest hedge fund and it's not pretty. While banks convince depositors that holding fiat is safe, Dalio's basically saying it's like storing ice cubes in the desert and calling it wealth preservation.

What's more is that when the people running the system are openly at war with each other, stability is the last thing you should expect. That's why TOKEN6900 doesn't even play the game.

In the TOKEN6900 universe, it's all hogwash anyway. The whole conversation is peak delusion.

TOKEN6900 strips it back to what matters and the truth is simple: you could drop an asteroid on the world, and somewhere there'd still be a T6900 holder, headphones on, vibing through the end of times.

Whether you want to buy Bitcoin or not, that's totally up to you. Nobody ever says that's what matters with TOKEN6900 – and certainly not its holders.

Because those tuned into the same wavelength know it's all a fugazi, it's a whoozie, it's a woozie.

What matters for TOKEN6900 is vibe liquidity and its growing congregation of terminally online traders.

Some whisper that TOKEN6900 is building a cult. That's not entirely true… although the Church of 69 does raise eyebrows, especially with that whole “swear on the Old TestaMeme” thing.

dunwasturtymeonmeuralrdythavoiceinsidiead pic.twitter.com/94j7Yn5w4l

— Token6900 (@Token_6900) July 28, 2025



Either way, those who understand the principle – staying true to what it is and what it represents, which is pure absurdity – get the idea.

That's why TOKEN6900 proudly calls itself the first NCT: Non-Corrupt Token. It is what it is, and it's not pretending to be more.

Here's another truth bomb: there's a hard cap. As the scriptures never said, man shall not live by bread alone, but by memes and eternal vibes – TOKEN6900 was never about the money.

The hard cap means that, no matter how many try to ape in later, they'll have to wait until it hits the exchanges.

Because the invitation to join the Initial Cult Offering – uh, Coin Offering, right – will vanish once funding hits the sacred $5 million.

And at the current rate, tomorrow could mark the 30% milestone, which in meme numerology probably means absolutely nothing, but we'll take it as a sign anyway.

So what's the purpose of the money? To build a golden calf? No, young one. 

It's simply that the initial tokens are the ticket to the congregation – those who can proudly say, this is what it means to be a meme coin, and I'm with it through flood, fire, and rugpull.

You've already heard the number. You know the cap. What matters now is timing and the clock isn't exactly subtle.

The presale price is still holding, but once this phase ends, the market will decide what comes next. TOKEN6900 staking returns offer a 44% APY and are available to newly purchased tokens.

Head to the TOKEN6900 presale site and get T6900. Actually there are no fears of any rugpull since the token is audited by top security firms and also available for purchase in Best Wallet, the Certik-approved mobile crypto app.

Best Wallet is available now on Google Play or the Apple App Store.

[2025] UKFTT 900 (GRC)

29 Jul 2025

The First Tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) has dismissed an information rights appeal against a decision of the ICO concerning materials held by the FCDO.

The materials sought by the Appellant concerned an investigation by the Cabinet Office into the behaviour of the former Minister, Mr Christopher Pincher MP. The ICO had held that the FCDO was entitled to rely on exemptions under sections 40(2)(personal information) and 36(2)(c)(prejudice to the effective conduct of public affairs) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. The First Tier Tribunal agreed with the FCDO's submissions that the relevant materials were exempt from disclosure and dismissed each of the Appellant's grounds of appeal.

The FCDO was represented by Jason Pobjoy KC and Tom Watret.

The judgment can be found here.

Billionaire investor Ray Dalio is sounding the alarm once again and this time his recommendation is clear: allocate around 15% of your portfolio to Bitcoin (or gold) as a hedge against one of the most severe fiscal crises in U.S. history.

With national debt soaring beyond $37 trillion and currency devaluation becoming an ever-present concern, Dalio's point cuts straight to the core of today's macro risks.

If you're looking to maintain a disciplined Bitcoin position over time, one tool stands out: Best Wallet (BEST). 

The leading Web3 wallet has bootstrapped over $14.3 million of early capital from investors recognizing its potential. Its roadmap includes features built specifically for long-term strategies, including one that perfectly aligns with Dalio's BTC allocation advice.

The presale is ongoing but only until the next funding phase. At $0.025365 per BEST token, this could be one of the final low-cost entry points before the price increases in under 34 hours as the next round kicks off.

Dalio, the former co-CIO of Bridgewater Associates, the largest hedge fund in the world, has a track record of getting big calls right.

He positioned his firm defensively before the 2008 financial crisis. He correctly warned of the Eurozone debt crisis, highlighting debt sustainability risks in Southern Europe, particularly Greece, Italy, and Spain. His concept of the “beautiful deleveraging” helped shape the broader debate around austerity and stimulus.

Through the 2010s, Dalio forecast an extended low-rate environment driven by central bank policy. He cautioned that excessive quantitative easing would debase fiat currencies over time, which is a key reason he turned bullish on gold, and later, on Bitcoin.

That money printing has only accelerated. U.S. M2 money supply has now surpassed $22 trillion. Over the same period, gold – the traditional hedge – climbed from around $1,096 per ounce to over $3,324.

But gold's returns pale compared to Bitcoin. Over the last decade, BTC surged roughly 462,266,567% from its early price levels. And since 2020, it has gained an additional 16x, reaching a new all-time high just this month.

It's no surprise Dalio has raised his suggested Bitcoin allocation to 15% (though he remains partial to gold). The Bitcoin narrative grows more compelling as a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty, with strong tailwinds favoring hard-capped assets like BTC.

Institutional demand adds to this outlook. Heavy buy-side pressure suggests BTC's price may have room to appreciate further.

The question for retail traders is: what's the best way to follow Dalio's advice and build and maintain a Bitcoin position? The answer is increasingly pointing toward Best Wallet.

Best Wallet is quickly building a reputation as the leading crypto wallet, with features that align perfectly with today's market demands.

Its transactional capabilities are powered by smart integrations with over 330 decentralized protocols and more than 30 cross-chain bridges, giving users access to deep liquidity and competitive pricing across multiple networks. 

According to its roadmap, holding BEST tokens will also unlock gas token-free transactions. This design choice benefits both active traders and long-term holders by reducing costs and maximizing returns.

Onboarding has been made equally simple. With support for over 100 fiat currencies, even new users can easily convert traditional money to crypto, making BTC purchases straightforward through Best Wallet.

The upcoming Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) feature is perhaps most relevant to long-term Bitcoin allocation. This tool, which will be launched in Phase 4 of its roadmap, will allow users to automatically invest incremental amounts into BTC at set intervals, smoothing out volatility over time. 

Automated DCA removes the guesswork and emotional timing from investing, helping users steadily build exposure without the stress of short-term price swings.

By pairing automation with seamless onramps, Best Wallet makes disciplined Bitcoin accumulation easier than ever – exactly the approach that aligns with Dalio's call for a sustained BTC position.

Yet Best Wallet goes beyond crypto allocation. Part of its ongoing development focuses on integrating TradFi-style functionality directly into the wallet.

A key feature in this evolution will be Best Card, the upcoming debit card service that allows token holdings within the app to be used for real-world transactions.

That means if you've accumulated enough spare satoshis for your morning coffee, you can spend them instantly through Best Wallet in a fast, efficient, and seamless way.

The card also offers up to 8% cashback on purchases, with low-to-no fees for users holding BEST tokens.

Its attention to detail plus the consideration for real-world usability is part of why Best Wallet recently earned a WalletConnect certification, which testifies to its commitment to a smooth, reliable user experience across thousands of dApps.

Aside from a strategic and disciplined Bitcoin accumulation, Best Wallet also caters to the high-beta opportunities in crypto. One feature in particular has become a favorite among its users for its track record of spotting early-stage projects with strong upside potential.

That feature is Upcoming Tokens. Designed to surface projects the team has identified as high-potential before exchange listings, it has consistently highlighted winners ahead of the market.

Its calls include Wall Street Pepe (WEPE), up 34.7% in the past two weeks, and Solaxy (SOLX), Solana's first Layer-2 chain, which has climbed 34% in just the past week. 

Past standouts include Pepe Unchained (PEPU), which peaked at a 700% gain, Catslap (SLAP), which delivered returns exceeding 7,000%, and BTC Bull (BTCBULL), which saw a 112% return for many Best Wallet users who explored the project in Upcoming Tokens.

For users seeking more than long-term BTC strategies, Upcoming Tokens provides a way to capture potential alpha in high-performing early projects.

Taken together, Best Wallet delivers a complete suite of features, combining stable, disciplined strategies with high-reward opportunities, all while building toward real-world utility through upcoming features like Best Card.

If you see how Best Wallet is reshaping the way users manage Bitcoin and tap into emerging opportunities, the next step beyond using it is securing a stake in its ecosystem.

That comes through holding BEST tokens. With the abovementioned utility across the platform, the token's demand is primarily driven by its 250,000 monthly active users – and that number is still growing.

Further boosting its value is the staking activity. Over 281 million BEST tokens are already locked in the independent staking protocol, earning a dynamic APY of 94%.

If you want a share of that rewards pool or a stake in one of the fastest-growing Web3 wallets, head to the Best Wallet presale site.

BEST tokens can be purchased directly in-app using a bank card, or by swapping ETH or USDT.

Stay connected with the community on X, Telegram, and Discord, and visit Best Wallet to learn more.

Best Wallet is available for download on Google Play and the Apple App Store.

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced Tuesday, it has officially launched its long-anticipated licensing regime for stablecoin issuers, with new guidelines set to come into effect August 1. 

The move latest update shows Hong Kong's intention to regulate the growing stablecoin sector, offering clarity for market participants while reinforcing investor protection and financial integrity.

The HKMA published two sets of documents: the “Guidelines on the Supervision of Licensed Stablecoin Issuers” and the “Guidelines on Combating Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing.” 

These were accompanied by summary notes detailing licensing application procedures and transitional provisions for existing issuers. Institutions interested in applying must contact the HKMA by August 31 to receive early-stage feedback, with a submission deadline of September 30 for those ready to proceed.

Stablecoin issuers operating in or marketing to Hong Kong must now comply with the new Stablecoin Ordinance. The HKMA has warned that misleading claims regarding licensing status could result in criminal penalties. 

The Authority has not granted any licenses as of July 29, and the public is advised to verify any issuer's credentials through the HKMA website before transacting.

The transitional framework allows existing stablecoin issuers time to align with the new rules. Issuers already active in the market are expected to gradually bring their operations into compliance. 

The HKMA has positioned the licensing process as ongoing, encouraging applicants to demonstrate full preparedness before submitting materials for review.

HKMA is actively shaping a regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers with a focus on risk mitigation, consumer protection, and financial system integrity.

By introducing a clear licensing regime, the HKMA said it aims to make sure that only well-governed, transparent, and properly capitalized players can operate in the space. 

Beyond protection, the framework also reflects Hong Kong's ambition to lead in regulated digital finance. With robust guardrails in place, the city can attract quality innovation, support institutional engagement, and strengthen its reputation as a global financial hub. 

Last week, Hong Kong said it will soon make it illegal to market unlicensed stablecoins to the public, as the city tightens controls ahead of the rollout of a long-anticipated regulatory framework. 

The move comes as authorities seek to cool market euphoria and protect retail investors from hype and fraud in the digital asset space. Eddie Yue, chief executive of HKMA issued a warning on Wednesday, just days before the city's Stablecoins Ordinance comes into effect on Aug. 1.

Ultimately, this licensing initiative lays the groundwork for broader digital currency adoption, including potential central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The HKMA's strategy is clear: responsible innovation, backed by strong oversight, is key to unlocking the benefits of digital money while minimizing its risks.

While the current focus is on private stablecoins, this regulatory rollout could be a precursor to broader digital currency ambitions. Hong Kong has been actively exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), both at the wholesale and retail levels.

As the US president's family profits from private money, the Bank of England is showing necessary leadership by rejecting the hype

Hype too often influences policymakers when it comes to regulating markets. So it was reassuring to hear Sir Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, resist the momentum behind cryptocurrencies. In his July Mansion House speech, he reiterated his scepticism over the need for a “Britcoin” central bank digital currency or a UK stablecoin, with tokens issued by finance houses and backed by their sterling reserves. As Donald Trump signs stablecoins into US law and rebrands private dollars with political colours, Sir Andrew's caution isn't just prudent, it's essential.

The governor's view is that UK banks should not be allowed to issue their own stablecoins. Nor should the Bank effectively run Britcoin bank accounts without clear public benefit. These are not the views of a luddite, but of a regulator worried, correctly, about creating a new class of imprudent assets. The key question is not whether new technologies can be adopted in finance, but whether they should be – especially when the consequences of failure could affect the wider economy.

George Osborne, the former Tory chancellor who advises a large cryptocurrency exchange, argued that Mr Trump's embrace of stablecoins, which are privately issued digital money, means Britain must sign up to remain relevant. The former Labour cabinet minister Ed Balls considered this naive, given recent history. He was right.

Stablecoins are not, despite the branding, stable. These private digital tokens purport to be backed one for one by real money, often US dollars. But the peg is only as trustworthy as the institution making the promise. When a commercial bank issues a stablecoin, it is effectively minting its own currency – without, as the Bank for International Settlements noted, the backing, oversight or “lender of last resort” guarantees of a central bank. This creates a parallel financial market, one prone to runs, crashes and contagion – just as happened in 19th-century America's free banking era, when half the new banks collapsed, many unable to honour the notes they had issued.

Yet Mr Trump is pressing ahead by letting banks and even non-banks issue dollar-pegged crypto assets. He is also leveraging the power of his office for personal gain in plain sight. One of the Trump family's cryptocurrencies is conservatively estimated to have pulled in at least $320m since January, while another received a $2bn investment from a foreign government wealth fund. A third has sold at least $550m in tokens. Steven Levitsky of Harvard University spoke for many when he told the Guardian this summer that he had “never seen such open corruption in any modern government anywhere”.

Cyber-libertarians view cryptocurrencies as a tool to evade state control, regulation and taxation, aligning with radical rightwing ideas about government as a problem. This seems to be the view of Paul Marshall, the UK hedge fund tycoon and media baron, who sees a Manichean world of central bank fiat versus free-market cash. Such ideological takes don't help with stable capital markets or effective consumer protection. Britain's financial sector should be smaller for the country's long-term health, but it must still remain competitive – on regulatory terms that preserve stability, not simply to keep pace with Trump-era financial populism or petro-state opportunism. Crypto is a gamble not just on technology, but on the very meaning of money and who gets to control it.

Oops, something went wrong

The cryptocurrency market has been witnessing a strong rally this month. Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency globally, touched the all-time high of 123,091.61 on July 14. Thereafter, it hovers around 118,000. Ethereum (ETH) rebounded sharply and is up more than 57% in the past month.

Positive developments on the global tariff and trade front and the evaporation of a near-term recession fear in the U.S. economy boosted cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, this space gathers momentum predominantly through favorable regulatory developments.

At this stage, it should be fruitful to invest in crypto-centric stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank for near-term gain. Five such stocks are: Robinhood Markets Inc. HOOD, Interactive Brokers Group Inc. IBKR, IREN Ltd. IREN, Visa Inc. V and Cipher Mining Inc. CIFR.

On July 18, President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins) seeking to regulate the stablecoin market of the nation. Stablecoins are digital assets that are built to maintain a stable value relative to a “stable” asset like the US dollar. Giant retailers such as Walmart and Amazon are considering launching their own stablecoins to reduce dependence on traditional payment networks like plastic money.

Two major cryptocurrency-related regulations still pending are The CLARITY Act and The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act. The CLARITY Act aims to define when crypto is a commodity or a security.

The CLARITY Act would establish a regulatory framework for digital assets other than stablecoins. This will allow crypto exchanges to register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission thereby reducing the Securities and Exchange Commission's regulation of digital currencies.

The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act aims to prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) directly to individuals or indirectly through intermediaries. The bill also prohibits the Federal Reserve from developing or issuing a CBDC without explicit authorization from Congress.

The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past month.

This expansion of V includes collaboration with prominent merchant acquirers Worldpay and Nuvei, marking a pivotal development in the world of digital payments.

Today the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) published several documents relating to the new stablecoin regulations which become effective  on 1 August 2025. The regulator had warned that the anti money laundering (AML) requirements would be strict, and they are. Most of the AML document reads as expected, but one particular clause effectively requires the stablecoin issuer to identify every stablecoin holder.

In other jurisdictions, issuers perform AML and compliance on their direct counterparties, including anyone requesting a redemption. The HKMA supports the additional use of blockchain analytics to enhance compliance. However, one key clause says that it is ‘yet to be proven' whether this is sufficient to address risks. So it concludes:

“Unless a licensee can demonstrate to the HKMA's satisfaction that these risk mitigating measures are effective in preventing and combating ML/TF and other crimes, the identity of each individual stablecoin holder should be verified.”

The issuer can either do so directly, even if it has no relationship with the holder, or the identification can be performed by an intermediary such as a crypto exchange, a bank, or some other ‘reliable' third party.

HKMA CEO Eddie Yue hinted at this stance when he said that he didn't expect to see significant volumes from early stablecoins owing to stringent compliance requirements.

This position is reflected in today's document, which implies it won't apply forever, but is the regulator's “cautious approach in the early stages of implementation.”

It continued, “The HKMA will continue to evaluate the effectiveness and appropriateness of such measures considering, among other things, the evolving regulatory landscape, the advancement in relevant technology solutions and the latest international best practices.”

To back up its position, the HKMA pointed to the Bank for International Settlements' (BIS) recent opinions about stablecoin vulnerability as well as FATF saying that some have adopted a prudent position. When a subsidiary of the French bank Societe Generale first issued its EURCV stablecoin, it also took such an approach, but later relaxed it. Most of the major jurisdictions with stablecoin laws, such as the US, Singapore and EU, do not have this requirement, although the EU does impose enhanced due diligence on certain transactions involving self-hosted wallets.

In the fast-paced realm of digital assets, seamless and secure transactions are paramount. IKA is poised to revolutionize our experience with cryptocurrency, introducing a solution that surmounts conventional barriers in cross-chain operations. This post delves into the potential transformative effects of IKA's Zero Trust Multi-Party Computation (MPC) protocol and decentralized wallet (dWallet) technology on fintech in Asia, compliance for SMEs in Europe, and the future of crypto payroll systems for startups.

IKA is breaking new ground in the crypto domain with its innovative Zero Trust MPC protocol and dWallet tech. It allows for secure, real-time cross-chain interactions without wrapping tokens or depending on trusted intermediaries. By letting users utilize native assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) across various blockchains, IKA addresses the issues traditional interoperability solutions face. Processing over 10,000 transactions per second, IKA guarantees that speed and security are crucial in managing digital assets.

Traditional cryptocurrency interoperability tends to rely on bridging solutions that often bring vulnerabilities and inefficiencies. What IKA does is bring you its MPC protocol, which needs multiple parties to work together for secure transactions. This zero-trust architecture not only boosts security but also cuts down counterparty risk significantly. Clearly, IKA might just be the disruptor we need, ensuring a more fluid experience for those treading the waters of cross-chain transactions.

The Asian fintech scene is rapidly changing, propelled by a rising need for efficient digital asset management among younger generations. IKA's tech seems tailor-made for this audience, offering an interoperability layer that enhances digital assets' usability. This could include cross-chain lending where IKA ensures automatic liquidation and zero-trust guarantees, and AI-powered DeFi integrations that elevate trading security. IKA is potentially putting the power back in the hands of startups, encouraging them to innovate in a fiercely competitive fintech environment.

As SMEs in Europe think about embracing IKA's cross-chain solutions, they'll have to deal with a convoluted regulatory landscape shaped by MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) and GDPR. Following these regulations is vital to avoid penalties and ensure smooth cross-border operations. Fortunately, IKA's technology may help these companies navigate compliance issues by providing transparent and secure transaction methods that align with regulatory requirements. Investing in compliance infrastructure could be what SMEs need to take full advantage of IKA's offerings.

IKA's recent Bitget listing could alter the landscape of crypto payroll systems for startups. By boosting the token's liquidity and visibility, IKA becomes a more appealing option for businesses seeking to implement crypto payroll solutions. Startups may find it easier to pay salaries and convert funds, enabling them to hire talent globally with crypto. As the demand for decentralized payroll tools grows, IKA's integration into AI-driven payroll systems will streamline compensation processes, enhancing efficiency and security.

IKA stands at the brink of redefining the crypto landscape with secure, rapid, and native asset-based cross-chain solutions. As conventional interoperability methods are challenged, IKA is also paving the way for better fintech solutions and smoother crypto payroll systems. By addressing core issues like trust, speed, and asset usability, IKA is gearing up to become a cornerstone of the next-gen digital banking experience. As we embrace these innovations, IKA is ready to lead the way in managing and transacting with digital assets.

Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, July 29th, 2025, Chainwire

Vietnam's crypto market is rapidly emerging as a major force in the global digital asset landscape, driven by a youthful, tech-savvy population and strong community growth. With an estimated 21–27% of the population — nearly 16 million users — actively engaged in cryptocurrency by 2025, Vietnam ranks among the world's top countries for crypto adoption. Government initiatives, including a national blockchain development strategy underscore Vietnam's commitment to supporting the sector's continued expansion. These dynamics position Vietnam as a key regional hub and innovative leader in both cryptocurrency adoption and blockchain technology implementation.

BTSE's participation in GM Vietnam 2025 and Conviction 2025 will provide invaluable opportunities to connect with industry leaders, innovators, and the vibrant Vietnamese blockchain community. These events are crucial platforms for sharing insights, discussing emerging trends, and showcasing BTSE's commitment to providing secure and innovative solutions.

“We are thrilled to be a Silver Sponsor of both GM Vietnam 2025 and Conviction 2025,” said Jeff Mei, Chief Operating Officer at BTSE. “Vietnam is a dynamic and exciting market for blockchain technology, and these flagship industry conferences are vital for driving further adoption and collaboration. Our commitment to this region is steadfast, and we look forward to contributing to the growth and development of its thriving crypto ecosystem.”

Conviction 2025, set for August 9-10 in Ho Chi Minh City, will focus on innovation and the integration of AI with blockchain technology.

BTSE will have a prominent presence at both events, featuring sponsorship of key afterparties and side events. This sponsorship is a testament to BTSE's belief in the long-term potential of the Vietnamese market and its role in shaping the future of decentralized technologies.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Aubrey Strobel, a Bitcoin podcaster and former communications executive at Lolli, has co-founded Halcyon, a New York-based boutique communications firm specializing in emerging technologies such as Bitcoin, stablecoins, and artificial intelligence. The launch, announced on Tuesday, positions the firm as a strategic partner for early to mid-stage companies seeking to shape narratives and market strategies in the crypto and tech sectors [1].  

Halcyon's services extend beyond traditional public relations to include content creation, video production, and tailored go-to-market strategies. Strobel emphasized the firm's mission to address misrepresentations of Bitcoin and AI in media, stating, ""The Golden Age of tech is here, we cannot let it slip away because the stories failed to reflect the innovation"" [1]. The firm adopts a ""VC approach,"" aligning with founders through long-term partnerships and prioritizing brands that align with its thesis on Bitcoin, DeFi, AI, and stablecoins reshaping global systems [1].  

Strobel, who previously led communications at Lolli (acquired by Thesis) and advised Trust Machines, brings expertise in internet culture and technology storytelling. Her X following of nearly 150,000 and background in producing a Bitcoin-themed film—""Lekker Feeling: A Bitcoin Ekasi Story""—underscore her focus on narratives that bridge innovation and public understanding [1]. Co-founder Elena Nisonoff highlighted the team's ""unique advantage"" in anticipating market and cultural trends, enabling clients to ""get there first"" in competitive tech conversations [1].  

The firm's timing coincides with a pivotal period for crypto and AI. Bitcoin recently reached record highs, and the GENIUS stablecoin act became the first major U.S. crypto legislation. Additionally, reports suggest up to 15 crypto-related IPOs could materialize within two quarters [1]. These developments signal growing institutional interest in blockchain and AI, aligning with Halcyon's target market of companies at the forefront of these technologies.  

Analysis of the firm's strategy reveals a strategic pivot from traditional PR to a narrative-driven approach. By blending market insight with cultural awareness, Halcyon aims to position clients as pioneers in a rapidly evolving sector. Strobel's emphasis on ""reshaping global systems"" through Bitcoin and AI suggests a focus on systemic innovation rather than short-term gains. However, the firm's success will depend on its ability to differentiate itself in a crowded PR landscape and deliver measurable growth for early-stage clients.  

The launch reflects broader trends in crypto communications, where brands increasingly seek to align with regulatory progress and public sentiment. With the U.S. regulatory landscape shifting and investor appetite for tech-driven narratives rising, Halcyon's focus on Bitcoin and stablecoins may capitalize on the sector's momentum. Yet, the firm's emphasis on storytelling risks facing skepticism in markets where technical execution often outweighs marketing.

Shares of Hyperscale Data (GPUS) rose as much as 12% Monday after the company confirmed it has begun acquiring XRP, following through on its previously announced plan to allocate up to $10 million into the token as part of a broader digital asset strategy.

In a July 28 statement, the company said it views XRP as a scalable foundation for cross-border value transfer and emerging financial infrastructure. Executive Chairman Milton “Todd” Ault III called XRP a “foundational asset in the evolving global financial ecosystem.”

Hyperscale plans to publish weekly digital asset updates starting August 12, summarizing XRP holdings and cumulative activity. The company is also considering a 36-month lockup for its XRP reserves and may expand the $10 million cap depending on market conditions and financing availability.

The stock closed up 7.5% at $0.7835, after hitting a session high of $0.82.

JPMorgan (JPM) set its 2026 price target for trading platform Robinhood (HOOD) to $98, up from $47 in 2025, citing new product launches and acquisition of European crypto exchange Bitstamp.



Robinhood reports second-quarter earnings Wednesday. JPMorgan, which maintains a neutral rating on the stock, said it expects the company to post earnings per share of 31 cents, up from 21 cents in the year-earlier period and in line with estimates by FactSet and transaction-based revenue reaching $515 million.



Crypto trading revenue is expected to double to $169.3 million from $81 million the year before, according to FactSet estimates. Still, that's sharply below the first-quarter figure of $247 million, a sign of the platform's sensitivity to volatility and trading volumes in digital asset markets.



Shares of the Menlo Park, California-based company have risen 170% this year. They were recently 0.7% lower at $105.95.



The company's moves in crypto and tokenized finance will boost operating leverage and create long-term upside, JPMorgan said. That includes the $200 million acquisition of crypto exchange Bitstamp, which closed in June, and a series of recent product rollouts.



Chief among those is Robinhood's entry into tokenized stock trading in the European Union, which started this month under the bloc's MiCA regulatory framework. Compass Point notes that users can now trade more than 200 tokenized equities and ETFs nearly around the clock. Full 24/7 access is expected once Bitstamp's order book is integrated.



Robinhood charges a 0.1% fee on dollar conversions in jurisdictions where payment for order flow is banned. The firm plans to offer tokenized access to private companies like OpenAI and SpaceX, giving EU users exposure to traditionally off-limits investments and enabling future decentralized finance (DeFi) use cases.



While this revenue stream is still early-stage, Compass Point says U.S. regulators are showing signs of warming to the concept. The Securities and Exchange Commission recently granted a broker-dealer license to Dinari, a startup focused on tokenized equity trading, hinting that similar platforms — including Robinhood — may gain domestic traction.



While Robinhood's earnings may show some growth, Wall Street appear sto be starting to bet bigger on its future.

CoinDCX, India's largest crypto exchange, dismissed a local media report that U.S. rival Coinbase (COIN) was looking to acquire it.

""Ignore the rumours,"" CEO Sumit Gupta said Tuesday in a post on X.

Earlier in the day Mint reported that Coinbase was in advanced talks to acquire the Mumbai-based company, citing two people with knowledge of the matter. The potential acquisition could value CoinDCX at less than $1 billion, a steep drop from its $2.2 billion valuation in 2021, it said.

Mint's sources added that Coinbase already has equity in both CoinDCX and rival CoinSwitch.

In his post, Gupta emphasized the exchange's India-focused strategy.

""CoinDCX is 'super focused' on building for India's crypto story and not up for sale! Will share more later, but just wanted to clarify this upfront!"" Gupta noted.

Coinbase declined to comment.

""We don't comment on rumors or speculation. We have a bold mission to increase economic freedom in the world, and are constantly exploring opportunities around the world to build, buy, partner and invest to accelerate our roadmap,” it said.

CoinDCX recently suffered a $44 million security breach that targeted an operational wallet. The exploit was quickly contained, ensuring the crypto assets were untouched and safe in cold wallets.

 Bitcoin seemed unfazed at new transactions from Galaxy Digital, with “most” of the BTC ending up in exchange accounts. 

Key points:

Bitcoin returns to $119,000 after a CME gap fill as new Galaxy Digital exchange transactions fail to sway the market mood.

Nerves over “OG” BTC sales seem to have passed after last week's 80,000 BTC transaction.

Trading circles still see the potential for another BTC price dip. 

Bitcoin (BTC) returned to $119,000 on Tuesday as markets seemed to ignore the risk of another $450 million sell-off.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD up nearly 1%.

A brief dip toward $117,000 during the US trading hours the day before failed to spark a sustained downturn, with bulls retargeting a key resistance zone.

The relative strength came despite news that asset manager Galaxy Digital had moved another 3,782 BTC from its wallet, “most of which” was sent to exchanges, per analytics resource Lookonchain.

“Is GalaxyDigital helping clients sell $BTC again?” it queried in a post on X, alongside data from crypto intelligence firm Arkham.

While considerably smaller than the 80,000 BTC sale that Galaxy facilitated last week, the potential distribution was notable in having no perceptible impact on price.

In contrast, last week saw a dip to $114,500 as the market absorbed supply that had previously stayed dormant for 14 years.

The phenomenon has been seen before — as Cointelegraph reported, US trade tariffs and associated headlines have likewise had a diminishing effect on the market as 2025 has progressed.

Commenting on the current market structure, traders and analysts held mixed opinions.

Daan Crypto Trades noted that the $117,000 downturn had closed the latest weekend “gap” in CME Group's Bitcoin futures.

“And yet again, there's the CME gap close on Monday just like the previous 5 weeks. We're building quite the streak at this point,” he observed. 

For trading resource Material Indicators, short-term momentum depended on the 21-day simple moving average (SMA) at $117,480.

“Volatility is heating up ahead of the monthly close, and Trend Precognition is indicating that Bitcoin isn't likely to make a new high today,” it told X followers Tuesday. 

Still wary of a longer-term trend change was trader Roman, who warned of bearish divergences developing across price indicators and gave a potential downside target of $108,000.

“Likely going to see a 108k pullback OR we consolidate between here and 115k to sort them out,” he concluded, describing both outcomes as “likely.”

 Rakbank became the first traditional bank in the UAE to enable crypto trading for retail users through its mobile app, powered by Bitpanda. 

The National Bank of Ras Al Khaimah (Rakbank), a government-owned bank in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), is the first conventional bank in the country to offer retail crypto trading.

In a Tuesday news release, the bank announced the launch of a crypto brokerage service through its mobile banking app, allowing customers to buy, sell and swap cryptocurrencies directly from their UAE dirham accounts.

“We recognize the opportunity this solution will provide to customers in the UAE, as we believe they deserve a more efficient and seamless crypto buying, selling and swapping journey that is fully regulated and entirely in AED [dirhams],” said Raheel Ahmed, group CEO of Rakbank.

The new offering is powered by Austria-based Bitpanda, with transactions facilitated by Bitpanda Broker MENA DMCC, a Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA)-regulated entity in Dubai.

Rakbank said customers can trade crypto without needing to transfer funds to an external exchange or convert between fiat currencies, eliminating foreign exchange fees. The integration uses Bitpanda's infrastructure to execute trades and manage custody.

“We are proud to be the first conventional bank in the UAE to enable simple, secure, and regulated access to a world-class digital assets platform,” Ahmed said.

The crypto trading service is currently available by invitation only, with a broader rollout expected in the coming months.

Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, deputy CEO of Bitpanda, called the partnership “a big moment for digital assets in the region.” Bitpanda is regulated in multiple European jurisdictions and has existing institutional partnerships with Deutsche Bank, N26 and Raiffeisen Bank.

Cointelegraph reached out to Rakbank for comment but had not received a response by publication.

Last year, Rakbank partnered with Bitpanda to build a digital asset management platform for residents. The bank described digital assets as the “future,” adding that they offer a more efficient and secure way for customers to manage finances.

Rakbank's push into crypto comes as the UAE strives to establish itself as a primary destination for blockchain and crypto projects.

The Dubai Multi Commodities Centre free zone has attracted over 600 crypto companies, with more firms flocking to the Dubai International Financial Centre and One Central district as the country positions itself as a leader in digital finance.

Last month, the Dubai Financial Services Authority, the financial regulator in charge of the Dubai International Financial Centre, approved Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin.

 Stablecoin searches reached an all-time high on Google as market cap topped a record $270 billion following passage of the GENIUS Act. 

Google search data shows interest in stablecoins surged to an all-time high this month as regulations were greenlit, stablecoin issuance and supply skyrocketed, and institutions increasingly look to launch their own tokenized fiat equivalents. 

The previous peak for stablecoin searches was in May 2022, just after the depeg of the Terra (USTC) algorithmic stablecoin and the collapse of the Luna ecosystem. 

More recent data shows search interest surged in mid-June and then again in mid-July following the passing of the Guiding and Empowering Nation's Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act into law on July 18. 

“People are waking up to their potential,” commented crypto analyst “The DeFi Investor” on X, adding:

Crypto asset management firm Bitwise said on X that “stablecoins are going parabolic” on Monday as both stablecoin market capitalization and transactions have surged to record levels this year. 

“You can't spell ‘stablecoins' without ‘parabolic',” quipped Ethereum treasury firm SharpLink. 

Stablecoin total market capitalization is at a record high of $272 billion, which equates to around 7% of the total crypto market capitalization, according to CoinGecko.

Of this total, around 98% are stablecoins pegged to the US dollar, and Tether is the market-dominant issuer with a share of 60%. 

Nassar Al Achkar, chief strategy officer at the CoinW exchange, told Cointelegraph that stablecoins are gaining traction as a “hedge against crypto volatility.”

He said the demand is driven by their utility in cross-border payments and as a safe haven during market uncertainty, while “numerous institutions are announcing the launch of their own stablecoins.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","Ray Dalio suggests putting 15% in Bitcoin, gold amid US ‘debt doom loop'","https://cointelegraph.com/news/ray-dalio-suggests-15-percent-bitcoin-allocation","Tue, 29 Jul 2025 00:52:37 GMT","

 Hedge fund manager Ray Dalio suggests investors put 15% into store-of-value assets amid America's debt crisis. 

American billionaire and hedge fund manager Ray Dalio has recommended a 15% portfolio allocation into Bitcoin or gold to optimize for the “best return-to-risk ratio” in light of America's crippling debt problem and currency devaluation.

“[If] you were optimizing your portfolio for the best return-to-risk ratio, you would have about 15% of your money in gold or Bitcoin,” the founder of hedge fund firm Bridgewater Associates said during an appearance on the Master Investor podcast on Sunday.

Dalio said he has “some Bitcoin, but not much,” and is still “strongly preferring gold to Bitcoin,” however. 

But the exact split between Bitcoin (BTC) and gold “is up to you,” Dalio said. His 15% suggestion marks a sharp increase from the 1% to 2% Bitcoin allocation he recommended in January 2022.

Dalio's comments were made in the context of America's national debt crisis, which has ballooned to $36.7 trillion, US Treasury data shows.

“The issue is the devaluation of money,” Dalio said while pointing out that the US government will likely need to issue another $12 trillion worth of Treasurys over the next year to service its mounting debt.

A US Treasury report released on Monday projected another $1 trillion in new borrowing in the third quarter — $453 billion more than previously estimated — due to weaker cash flows and lower reserves. 

The Treasury also expects to borrow $590 billion in Q4, adding to the US government's growing reliance on debt to fund budget expenses and worsening concerns about its future fiscal path.

Dalio noted that other Western countries — including the United Kingdom — face the same “debt doom loop” issue and that their currencies will continue to underperform relative to hard currencies like Bitcoin and gold — which he described as an “effective diversifier.”

Despite advocating for Bitcoin as a portfolio diversifier, Dalio remains skeptical about its potential to serve as a reserve currency. He expressed doubt that any central bank would adopt the cryptocurrency in such a role, citing its lack of privacy and the transparent nature of its transactions. 

“Governments can see who is doing what transactions on it,” he said, suggesting that any potential vulnerabilities in Bitcoin's code may undermine its effectiveness as an alternative money.

Bitcoin and gold are performing strongly in the current economic climate, hitting respective highs in recent months.

Bitcoin is currently trading at $118,100 — around 4% below its July 14 all-time high of $123,230, TradingView data shows — while gold has reached new highs multiple times over the past few months.

Only the elite had this kind of protection.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

An inconspicuous piece of curved metal discovered in the Czech Republic by an amateur metal detectorist has proven a fascinating find. After two years of high-tech analysis, experts have come to believe that the bronze object was once armor used in the Trojan War 3,200 years ago. 

The metal detectorist initially discovered a whole collection of artifacts in 2023—including a spearhead, sickle, needle, and fragments of copper—all likely purposely buried together in a sacrificial ritual. But now, a couple of years later, one of the unassuming pieces of metal has become the headliner of the discovery, as experts believe it was the chest plate of an elite warrior from about 1200 B.C. 

“Using 3D scanning, we managed to digitally ‘unfold' the folded sheet metal and identify its shape and décor,” Ales Navratil, archaeologist at the Brno City Museum, said in a translated statement from the museum. “It was the ornament, recognized under a microscope, that confirmed that it was part of the body-protecting armor.” 

This is only the second known piece of bronze armor found in the Czech Republic, and dating it to 3,200 years ago ties it to the infamous Trojan War.

The initial find occurred at an undisclosed location—the secrecy is for the sake of the site's protection and preservation—and was treated as a cooperative discovery between the metal detectorist and the Regional Museum in Mikulov. The Brno City Museum and staff at Masaryk University worked to analyze what first appeared to be an inconsequential section of bronze amidst other bronze fragments. Now, museum experts call the armor a “remarkable discovery” that is “extremely rare.” 

During the Trojan War, most armor was crafted from organic material, meaning that it wasn't able to stand the test of time. Only privileged warriors in an elite class had access to bronze armor, which required not only the ability to purchase the metal, but the know-how to craft it into armor. The “extraordinary craftsmanship” on this piece implies it belonged to a warrior of importance. 

To preserve the sheet of metal, experts used the 3D scan to digitally unfold the piece.  

“This find confirms the importance of long-term cooperation between experts and the public,” Zbynek Solc, director of the Brno City Museum, said in a statement. “Thanks to it, we can discover and protect valuable artifacts that bring us closer to ancient eras and bring new knowledge about our history.” 

The museum—located in the Baroque fortress of Spilberk Castle known as the Dungeon of the Nations—plans to create a public presentation featuring the armor in an attempt to bring the “world of ancient warriors closer and connect Moravian history with the legendary epics of the ancient world.”

It won't make its way into quantum computers, but it could help us understand why the universe is filled with matter.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The universe is filled with something instead of nothing—and that's a problem. Well, a quick clarification: This unexplainable quirk of science is great news for you, me, and every other living being throughout the cosmos, since it means that we (being made of matter) get to exist. But from a particle physicist's perspective, it represents a massive gap of knowledge in the Standard Model, which is our current best guess at explaining the strange world of the subatomic.  

The Swiss-based particle physics laboratory CERN, home of the Large Hadron Collider, is at the forefront of exploring this particular unknown, which is an apparent violation of a fundamental law of nature known as charge-parity-time (CPT) symmetry. This nearly 75-year-old theory posits that matter and antimatter behave identically, meaning that they should have annihilated each other mere moments after the Big Bang. But for some reason, matter prevailed.

Now, a recent study—led by scientists at CERN and published in the journal Nature—details a new tool in their exploratory toolbox for trying to understand why the universe contains something instead of nothing. At its most basic, researchers created the world's first antimatter “qubit”—the quantum-powered building blocks of quantum computers—in an effort to study matter-antimatter asymmetry with higher fidelity. This was achieved by the Baryon Antibaryon Symmetry Experiment (BASE) collaboration using the antimatter factory at CERN. 

Like most things that deal with quantum properties, the main challenge was keeping the antiproton from experiencing decoherence, in which a qubit loses its quantum properties via disruptions from the surrounding environment. The researchers successfully kept the antiproton trapped and oscillating smoothly between quantum states for almost a minute and then measured transitions between magnetic moments using a process known as “coherent quantum transition spectroscopy.” Although an incredibly complicated process, CERN describes this method like pushing a child on a swingset: 

This qubit isn't destined to run in some hyper-advanced quantum computer. Instead, its role lies in exploring the very edge of the standard model of particle physics. Previously, BASE collaboration has shown that magnetic moments of protons and antiprotons are identical up to just a few parts-per-billion—any detectable deviation would violate CPT symmetry and possibly explain why protons outnumbered antiprotons following the Big Bang. However, these results used incoherent techniques impacted by magnetic field fluctuations and perturbations caused by the measurements themselves. This new technique suppresses those interferences and makes coherent observations that are many times more accurate than previous magnetic moment experiments. 

“This represents the first antimatter qubit and opens up the prospect of applying the entire set of coherent spectroscopy methods to single matter and antimatter systems in precision experiments,” BASE spokesperson Stefan Ulmer, a co-author of the study, said in a press statement. “Most importantly, it will help BASE to perform antiproton moment measurements in future experiments with 10- to 100-fold improved precision.”

And this new level of precision is only the beginning. A simultaneous effort known as BASE-STEP (Symmetry Tests in Experiments with Portable Antiprotons) utilizes a portable trap system so antiprotons can be transported to other facilities with more stable environments. In October of last year, BASE-STEP successfully transported 70 protons via truck on a round trip at CERN's main site. This will allow labs throughout Europe—and maybe, one day, the world—to work on one of physics' most puzzling mysteries.

Electrochemical cells - or batteries, as a well-known example - are complex technologies that combine chemistry, physics, materials science and electronics. More than power sources for everything from smartphones to electric vehicles, they remain a strong motivation for scientific inquiry that seeks to fully understand their structure and evolution at the molecular level.

A team led by Yingjie Zhang, a professor of materials science and engineering in The Grainger College of Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, has completed the first investigation into a widely acknowledged but often overlooked aspect of electrochemical cells: the nonuniformity of the liquid at the solid-liquid interfaces in the cells. As the researchers reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, microscopic imaging revealed that these interfacial structures, called electrical double layers (EDLs), tend to organize into specific configurations in response to chemical deposition on the surface of the solid.

""There's a tendency to think of electrochemical cells just for their technological utility as batteries, but there is still plenty of science to do on them that will inform the technological applications,"" said Qian Ai, a graduate student in Zhang's research group and the study's lead author. ""In our work, we carefully examined EDLs with 3D atomic force microscopy, a technique designed to sense small forces. We observed the molecular structure of inhomogeneous EDLs surrounding surface clusters for the first time.""

Electrochemical cells take advantage of mobile charges inside liquid electrolytes to maintain an electrical imbalance that gives rise to a voltage difference between two terminals. The earliest investigations of these systems over 100 years ago revealed the existence of EDLs at the interface between the liquid electrolyte and solid conductor mediating the voltage difference. They consist of electrolytes self-organized into nanometer-thick layers at the interface.

Past work has shown that solid-liquid interfaces in batteries are heterogeneous, exhibiting spatially varying chemical compositions and morphologies, sometimes forming surface clusters. However, these attempts to study and model electrochemical cells focused only on model systems with flat and uniform surfaces. The result is a knowledge gap that impedes our understanding of electrochemical cells and battery technology.

To investigate the heterogeneous interfaces, the team used 3D atomic force microscopy, a technique designed to sense small forces. This method allowed them to correlate the inhomogeneity in EDLs with the surface clusters, structures that nucleate at the initial stages of battery charging. Based on the data, the researchers proposed three primary responses in the EDLs: ""bending,"" in which the layers appear to curve around the cluster; ""breaking,"" in which parts of the layers detach to form new intermediate layers; and ""reconnecting,"" in which the EDL layer above the cluster connects to a nearby layer with an offset in the layer number.

""These three patterns are quite universal,"" Ai said. ""Those structures are mainly due to the finite size of the liquid molecules, not their specific chemistry. We should be able to predict the liquid structure based on the solid's surface morphology for other systems.""

Going forward, the researchers look forward to expanding their findings.

""This is groundbreaking,"" Zhang said. ""We have resolved the EDLs in realistic, heterogeneous electrochemical systems, which is a holy grain in electrochemistry. Besides the practical implications in technology, we are starting to develop new chapters in electrochemistry textbooks.""

A team of UC Merced researchers has shown that tiny artificial cells can accurately keep time, mimicking the daily rhythms found in living organisms. Their findings shed light on how biological clocks stay on schedule despite the inherent molecular noise inside cells.

The study, recently published in Nature Communications, was led by bioengineering Professor Anand Bala Subramaniam and chemistry and biochemistry Professor Andy LiWang. The first author, Alexander Zhang Tu Li, earned his Ph.D. in Subramaniam's lab.

Biological clocks -- also known as circadian rhythms -- govern 24-hour cycles that regulate sleep, metabolism and other vital processes. To explore the mechanisms behind the circadian rhythms of cyanobacteria, the researchers reconstructed the clockwork in simplified, cell-like structures called vesicles. These vesicles were loaded with core clock proteins, one of which was tagged with a fluorescent marker.

The artificial cells glowed in a regular 24-hour rhythm for at least four days. However, when the number of clock proteins was reduced or the vesicles were made smaller, the rhythmic glow stopped. The loss of rhythm followed a reproducible pattern.

To explain these findings, the team built a computational model. The model revealed that clocks become more robust with higher concentrations of clock proteins, allowing thousands of vesicles to keep time reliably -- even when protein amounts vary slightly between vesicles.

The model also suggested another component of the natural circadian system -- responsible for turning genes on and off -- does not play a major role in maintaining individual clocks but is essential for synchronizing clock timing across a population.

The researchers also noted that some clock proteins tend to stick to the walls of the vesicles, meaning a high total protein count is necessary to maintain proper function.

""This study shows that we can dissect and understand the core principles of biological timekeeping using simplified, synthetic systems,"" Subramaniam said.

The work led by Subramaniam and LiWang advances the methodology for studying biological clocks, said Mingxu Fang, a microbiology professor at Ohio State University and an expert in circadian clocks.

""The cyanobacterial circadian clock relies on slow biochemical reactions that are inherently noisy, and it has been proposed that high clock protein numbers are needed to buffer this noise,"" Fang said. ""This new study introduces a method to observe reconstituted clock reactions within size-adjustable vesicles that mimic cellular dimensions. This powerful tool enables direct testing of how and why organisms with different cell sizes may adopt distinct timing strategies, thereby deepening our understanding of biological timekeeping mechanisms across life forms.""

Subramaniam is a faculty member in the Department of Bioengineering and an affiliate of the Health Sciences Research Institute (HSRI). LiWang is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, also affiliated with HSRI. He is a fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology and the 2025 recipient of the Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin Award from The Protein Society.

The work was supported by Subramaniam's National Science Foundation CAREER award from the Division of Materials Research and by grants from the National Institutes of Health and Army Research Office awarded to LiWang. LiWang was supported by a fellowship from the NSF CREST Center for Cellular and Biomolecular Machines at UC Merced.

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is tough on electronics. Situated inside a 17-mile-long tunnel that runs in a circle under the border between Switzerland and France, this massive scientific instrument accelerates particles close to the speed of light before smashing them together. The collisions yield tiny maelstroms of particles and energy that hint at answers to fundamental questions about the building blocks of matter.

Those collisions produce an enormous amount of data -- and enough radiation to scramble the bits and logic inside almost any piece of electronic equipment.

That presents a challenge to CERN's physicists as they attempt to probe deeper into the mysteries of the Higgs boson and other fundamental particles. Off-the-shelf components simply can't survive the harsh conditions inside the accelerator, and the market for radiation-resistant circuits is too small to entice investment from commercial chip manufacturers.

""Industry just couldn't justify the effort, so academia had to step in,"" according to Peter Kinget, the Bernard J. Lechner Professor of Electrical Engineering at Columbia Engineering. ""The next discoveries made with the LHC will be triggered by one Columbia chip and measured by another.""

Kinget leads the team that designed specialized silicon chips that collect data in one of the harshest and most important environments in particle physics. Their most recent paper describing this project was published July 1 in the IEEE Open Journal of the Solid-State Circuits Society.

""These sort of collaborations between physicists and engineers are very important to advancing our ability to explore fundamental questions about the universe,"" according to John Parsons, professor of physics at Columbia University and leader of the Columbia team working on the ATLAS detector, one of the LHC's massive instruments. ""Developing state-of-the-art instrumentation is crucial to our success.""

Circuits that resist radiation

The devices the team designed are called analog-to-digital converters, or ADCs. Their task is capturing electrical signals produced by particle collisions inside CERN's detectors and translating them into digital data that researchers can analyze.

In the ATLAS detector, the electrical pulses generated by particle collisions are measured using a device called a liquid argon calorimeter. This enormous vat of ultra-cold argon captures an electronic trace of every particle that passes through. Columbia's ADC chips convert these delicate analog signals into precise digital measurements, capturing details that no existing component could reliably record.

""We tested standard, commercial components, and they just died. The radiation was too intense,"" says Rui (Ray) Xu, a Columbia Engineering PhD student who has worked on the project since he was an undergraduate at the University of Texas. ""We realized that if we wanted something that worked, we'd have to design it ourselves.""

Designing ""high-accuracy"" reliability

Instead of creating entirely new manufacturing methods, the team used commercial semiconductor processes validated by CERN for radiation resistance and applied innovative circuit-level techniques. They carefully chose and sized components and arranged circuit architectures and layouts to minimize radiation damage and built digital systems that automatically detect and correct errors in real time. Their resulting design is resilient enough to withstand the unusually severe conditions at LHC for more than a decade.

Two Columbia-designed ADC chips are expected to be integrated into the ATLAS experiment's upgraded electronics. The first, called the trigger ADC, is already operating at CERN. This chip, initially described in 2017 and validated in 2022, enables the trigger system to filter about a billion collisions each second and to instantly select only the most scientifically promising events to record. It serves as a digital gatekeeper deciding what merits deeper investigation.

The second chip, the data acquisition ADC, recently passed its final tests and is now in full production. The chip, which was described in an IEEE paper earlier this year, will be installed as part of the next LHC upgrade. It will very precisely digitize the selected signals, enabling physicists to explore phenomena like the Higgs boson, whose discovery at CERN made headlines in 2012 and led to the Nobel Prize in physics in 2013, but whose exact properties still hold mysteries.

Both chips represent the kind of direct collaboration between fundamental physicists and engineers.

""The opportunity as an engineer to contribute so directly to fundamental science, is what makes this project special,"" Xu said.

It further created opportunities to collaborate across multiple institutions. The chips were designed by electrical engineers at Columbia and at the University of Texas, Austin, in close collaboration with physicists at Columbia's Nevis Laboratories and the University of Texas, Austin.

Funded by the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy, Columbia's chips play a central role in a broader international collaboration coordinated in part by Columbia's Nevis Laboratories. As research at CERN advances, Columbia-designed components will contribute to data acquisition systems that support physicists in analysing phenomena beyond the current limits of knowledge.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","This gut hormone could explain 40% of IBS-D cases—and lead to a cure","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250729001208.htm","Tue, 29 Jul 2025 05:47:33 GMT","

High levels of a hormone found in cells in the gut could underlie many cases of chronic diarrhea and help explain up to 40% of cases of patients with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea, according to a new study led by scientists at the University of Cambridge.

The research, published in the journal Gut, could help in the development of a blood test and points towards a potential new treatment.

When we eat, the liver releases bile acid to break down fats so that they can be absorbed into the body. Bile acid is released into the top end of the small intestine and then absorbed back into the body at the lower end.

However, around one person in every 100 is affected by a condition known as bile acid diarrhea (also known as bile acid malabsorption), whereby the bile acid is not properly re-absorbed and makes its way into the large intestine (colon). It can trigger urgent and watery diarrhea, and patients can risk episodes of incontinence.

Bile acid diarrhea can be difficult to diagnose as there are currently no routine clinical blood tests. Many individuals are given a diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), an umbrella term for a range of conditions. As many as one in 20 people is thought to have IBS, of which an estimated one in three patients with diarrhea as their main symptom have undiagnosed bile acid diarrhea.

Studies in mice have previously suggested that the gut hormone known as Insulin-Like Peptide 5 (INSL5) - present in cells at the far end of the colon and rectum - may play a role in chronic diarrhea. INSL5 is released by these cells when irritated by bile acid.

Researchers at the Institute of Metabolic Science, University of Cambridge, have been exploring whether this hormone might also underlie chronic diarrhea in humans. This has been possible thanks to a new antibody test developed by pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, with whom the team is collaborating, which allows them to measure tiny amounts of INSL5.

A study at the University of Adelaide looking at ways to trigger release of the gut hormone GLP-1 - the hormone upon which weight-loss drugs are based - previously found that giving a bile acid enema to healthy volunteers triggered release of GLP-1, but had the unintended consequence of causing diarrhea. When the Cambridge team analyzed samples from this study, they found that the bile acid enema caused levels of INSL5 to shoot up temporarily - and the higher the INSL5 levels, the faster the volunteers needed to use the toilet. This confirmed that INSL5 is likely to play a role in chronic cases of diarrhea.

When the team analyzed samples obtained from Professor Julian Walters at Imperial College London, which include samples from patients with bile acid diarrhea, they found that while levels of INSL5 were almost undetectable in healthy volunteers, they were much higher in patients with bile acid diarrhea. In addition, the higher the INSL5 level, the more watery their stool samples.

Dr Chris Bannon from the University of Cambridge, the study's first author, said: ""This was a very exciting finding because it showed us that this hormone could be playing a big part in symptoms of this misunderstood condition. It also meant it might allow us to develop a blood test to help diagnose bile acid diarrhea if INSL5 levels are only high in these individuals.

""When you go to the doctor with chronic diarrhea, it's likely they'll test for food intolerances, rule out an infection or look for signs of inflammation. There has been significant research interest in the microbiome, but gut hormones have been neglected. But it's becoming increasingly clear that gut hormones play an important role in things like gut health and weight management.""

INSL5 also provides a potential target for treatment. Dr Bannon and colleagues obtained further samples from Professor Robin Spiller at the University of Nottingham, who had given the anti-sickness medication ondansetron - known to block the action of INSL5 in mice - to patients with IBS. Analysis of these samples by the Cambridge team showed that around 40% of these patients had raised levels of INSL5, even though they had had bile acid malabsorption ruled out, and these patients responded best to ondansetron.

Exactly why ondansetron is effective is currently unclear, though a known side effect of the drug is constipation. The team will now be investigating this further, hopeful that it will allow them either to repurpose the drug or to develop even better treatments. Bile acid diarrhea is usually treated with so-called bile acid sequestrants, but these are only effective in around two-thirds of patients.

Dr Bannon added: ""I often get asked why we would have a hormone that gives you diarrhea. I think of it as a kind of poison sensor. Bile acids aren't meant to be in the colon - they're an irritant to the colon and they're toxic to the microbiome. It makes sense that you would have something that detects toxins and helps the body rid itself of them. But a problem develops if it's always being triggered by bile acid, causing very dramatic symptoms.""

Dr Bannon is a clinical fellow in the group led by Professors Fiona Gribble and Frank Reimann at the Institute of Metabolic Science, University of Cambridge.

The research was supported by the Medical Research Council and Wellcome, with additional support from the National Institute for Health and Care Research Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre.

It's hard to tell when -- and why -- our ancestors got down from trees and started walking on two legs. Many early hominins capable of bipedal walking were also well-adapted for climbing, and we lack fossil evidence from a key period when climate change turned forests into open, dry woodland called savannah-mosaic, which might have pushed hominins onto the ground. Now a study on modern chimpanzees could help fill in the gaps. Scientists observing chimpanzees in the Issa Valley, Tanzania have shown that despite living in a savannah-mosaic, they frequently climb trees for valuable food -- potentially explaining why early hominins kept their arboreal adaptations.

""For decades it was assumed that bipedalism arose because we came down from the trees and needed to walk across an open savannah,"" said Dr Rhianna Drummond-Clarke of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, lead author of the article in Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution. ""Here we show that safely and effectively navigating the canopy can remain very important for a large, semi-arboreal ape, even in open habitat. Adaptations to arboreal, rather than terrestrial, living may have been key in shaping the early evolution of the human lineage.""

Habitats and hunger 

Issa Valley is divided between a small amount of thick forest surrounding riverbanks and open woodland. The chimpanzees forage more in the woodland during the dry season, when it offers more food. Their habitat and diet are comparable to those of some early hominins, which means their behavior might offer insights into those extinct hominins' lives.

""Our previous research found that, compared to chimpanzees living in forests, Issa Valley chimpanzees spent just as much time moving in the trees,"" said Drummond-Clarke. ""We wanted to test if something about how they foraged could explain their unexpectedly high arboreality. Savannah-mosaics are characterized by more sparsely distributed trees, so we hypothesized that adapting behavior to forage efficiently in a tree would be especially beneficial when the next tree is further away.""

Researchers monitored the adults of the Issa community during the dry season, watching how they foraged in trees and what they ate there. The size, height, and shape of the trees were recorded, as well as the number and size of branches.

Issa chimpanzees mostly ate fruit, followed by leaves and flowers -- foods found at the ends of branches, so the chimpanzees needed to be capable climbers to reach them safely. They spent longer foraging in trees that were larger and offered more food. The longest foraging sessions, and the most specialized behaviors to navigate thinner terminal branches, were seen in trees with large open crowns offering lots of food: perhaps abundant food justified the extra time and effort. A similar trade-off between the nutritional benefits of specific foods and the effort of acquiring them could also explain why chimpanzees spent longer in trees while eating nutritionally-rich, hard-to-access seeds.

Fast food 

Because they are relatively large, chimpanzees move within trees not by climbing on thin branches but by hanging under them, or standing upright and holding on to nearby branches with their hands. Although these 'safe' behaviors are traditionally associated with foraging in dense forest, these findings show they're also important for chimpanzees foraging in a savannah-mosaic.

""We suggest our bipedal gait continued to evolve in the trees even after the shift to an open habitat,"" said Drummond-Clarke. ""Observational studies of great apes demonstrate they can walk on the ground for a few steps, but most often use bipedalism in the trees. It's logical that our early hominin relatives also engaged in this kind of bipedalism, where they can hold onto branches for extra balance. If Issa Valley chimpanzees can be considered suitable models, suspensory and bipedal behaviors were likely vital for a large-bodied, fruit-eating, semi-terrestrial hominin to survive in an open habitat.""

However, the researchers say that we need more fossil evidence and more studies on different aspects of chimpanzee foraging to test this idea.

""This study only looked at foraging behavior during the dry season,"" cautioned Drummond-Clarke. ""It would be interesting to investigate if these patterns remain during the wet season. Analyses of the nutritional value of foods and overall food availability are also needed to test our hypothesis that a strategy of foraging for longer in large trees on certain foods is energy-efficient in an open habitat.

""Importantly, this is also only one community of chimpanzees. Future studies of other chimpanzees living in such dry, open habitats will be vital to see if these patterns are truly a savannah-mosaic signal or unique to Issa.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Digital twins are reinventing clean energy — but there's a catch","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250729001217.htm","Tue, 29 Jul 2025 11:07:51 GMT","

As the world grapples with the urgent need to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change, researchers at the University of Sharjah are turning to a cutting-edge technology that could reshape the future of energy: AI-powered digital twins.

According to the researchers, these digital replicas of the physical world have the potential to transform the generation, management, and optimization of energy across diverse clean energy platforms, accelerating the transition away from fossil fuels, which environmental scientists associate with global warming.

Digital twins' ability to replicate and interact with complex systems has made them a cornerstone of innovation across industries, driving improvements in efficiency, cost reduction, and the development of novel solutions.

However, the scientists caution that current digital twin models still face notable limitations that restrict their full potential in harnessing energy from sources such as wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric, and biomass.

""Digital twins are highly effective in optimizing renewable energy systems,"" the researchers write in the journal Energy Nexus. ""Yet, each energy source presents unique challenges -- ranging from data variability and environmental conditions to system complexity -- that can limit the performance of digital twin technologies, despite their considerable promise in improving energy generation and management.""

In their study, the authors conducted an extensive review of existing literature on the application of digital twins in renewable energy systems. They examined various contexts, functions, lifecycles, and architectural frameworks to understand how digital twins are currently being utilized and where gaps remain.

To extract meaningful insights, the researchers employed advanced text mining techniques, leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing. This scientifically rigorous approach enabled them to analyze large volumes of raw data and uncover structured patterns, concepts, and emerging trends.

From this in-depth analysis, the authors drew several key conclusions. They identified research gaps, proposed new directions, and outlined the challenges that must be addressed to fully harness the potential of digital twin technology in the renewable energy sector.

Following a detailed discussion on the integration of digital twins across various renewable energy applications, the authors summarized their most significant findings across five major energy sources: wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric, and biomass. Each source presents unique opportunities and challenges, and the study offers a comprehensive overview of how digital twins can be tailored to optimize performance in each domain.

The study reveals that digital twins offer significant advantages across various renewable energy systems:

Wind Energy: Digital twins can predict unknown parameters and correct inaccurate measurements, enhancing system reliability and performance.

Solar Energy: They help identify key factors that influence efficiency and output power, enabling better system design and optimization.

Geothermal Energy: Digital twins can simulate the entire operational process -- particularly drilling -- facilitating cost analysis and reducing both time and expenses.

Hydroelectric Energy: The AI-driven models simulate system dynamics to identify influencing factors. In older hydro plants, they are used to mitigate the impact of worker fatigue on productivity.

Biomass Energy: Digital twins improve performance and management by offering deep insights into operational processes and plant configurations.

But the authors' contribution to the field stands out in highlighting critical limitations in the application of digital twin technology across these energy sources. Their analysis underscores the need for more robust models that can address specific challenges unique to each renewable energy system.

The authors identify several limitations in the application of digital twins across different renewable energy systems:

Wind Energy: Digital twins face challenges in accurately modeling and monitoring environmental conditions. They struggle to simulate critical factors such as blade erosion, gearbox degradation, and electrical system performance -- particularly in aging turbines.

Solar Energy: Despite their potential, digital twins still fall short in reliably predicting long-term performance. They have difficulty tracking panel degradation and accounting for environmental influences over time, which affects their accuracy and usefulness.

Geothermal Energy: A major obstacle is the lack of high-quality data, which hampers the ability of digital twins to simulate geological uncertainties and subsurface conditions. The technology also faces complexity in modeling the long-term behavior of geothermal systems, including heat transfer and fluid flow dynamics.

Hydroelectric energy: Applied to hydroelectric projects, digital twins face challenges in accurately modeling water flow variability and in capturing environmental and ecological constraints. These limitations reduce their effectiveness in optimizing system performance and sustainability.

biomass energy: When used with biomass energy systems, digital twins still struggle to simulate the entire production supply chain. They fall short in providing precise models for biological processes, biomass conversion, and the complex biochemical and thermochemical reactions involved.

The authors emphasize the broader implications of these shortcomings for the renewable energy sector. To address these challenges, they offer a set of guidelines and a research roadmap aimed at helping scientists enhance the reliability and precision of digital twin technologies.

Their recommendations focus on improving data collection methods, advancing modeling techniques, and expanding computational capabilities to ensure digital twins can deliver trustworthy insights for decision-making and system optimization.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Walk faster, live longer: How just 15 minutes a day can boost lifespan","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250729001211.htm","Tue, 29 Jul 2025 06:38:43 GMT","

Regular walking is widely recognized for its significant benefits to overall health and well-being. Previous research has primarily focused on middle-to-high-income White populations. Now, a novel analysis using data from the Southern Community Cohort Study, involving 79,856 predominantly low-income and Black individuals across 12 southeastern US states, confirms the benefits of regular walking, especially at a faster pace, within a crucial, underrepresented group. The new study appearing in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, published by Elsevier, underscores the importance of promoting walking, particularly at a brisk pace, as an effective form of physical activity for improving health.

Lead investigator Wei Zheng, MD, PhD, Division of Epidemiology, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt Epidemiology Center, School of Medicine, Vanderbilt University, and Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, says, ""While the health benefits of daily walking are well-established, limited research has investigated effects of factors such as walking pace on mortality, particularly in low-income and Black/African-American populations. Our research has shown that fast walking as little as 15 minutes a day was associated with a nearly 20% reduction in total mortality, while a smaller reduction in mortality was found in association with more than three hours of daily slow walking. This benefit remained strong even after accounting for other lifestyle factors and was consistent across various sensitivity analyses.""

Participants reported the average amount of time per day (minutes) they typically spend ""walking slowly (such as moving around, walking at work, walking the dog, or engaging in light exercise)"" and ""walking fast (such as climbing stairs, brisk walking, or exercising)."" Information regarding vital status and cause of death was obtained by linking the cohort to the National Death Index.

The protective effect of fast walking extended to all causes of death but was most pronounced for cardiovascular diseases. Importantly, the benefits of fast walking were independent of overall leisure-time physical activity levels (LTPA). Even for those who are already engaged in slow walking or some LTPA, adding more fast walking further reduced mortality.

According to the study the benefits of fast walking related to cardiovascular health are:

Low-income populations often face economic constraints and are more likely to reside in impoverished, highly polluted communities with limited access to safe walking spaces. Additionally, these populations tend to have a higher prevalence of lifestyle behaviors that may increase disease risk and mortality, such as lower quality diet, cigarette smoking, and heavy alcohol consumption. At the same time, there are other challenges for individuals with low income such as lack of access to health insurance or healthcare that may also increase mortality. These factors collectively contribute to an increased mortality among low-income individuals and may potentially elucidate the racial disparities observed in longevity. By demonstrating the benefits of fast walking in this study, this research provides direct evidence to inform targeted interventions and policies to improve health equity.

Lead author of the article Lili Liu, MPH, Division of Epidemiology, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt Epidemiology Center, School of Medicine, and Vanderbilt University, Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, concludes, ""Public health campaigns and community-based programs can emphasize the importance and availability of fast walking to improve health outcomes, providing resources and support to facilitate increased fast walking within all communities. Furthermore, the findings of the reduced mortality associated with fast walking pace were supported by previous studies conducted in middle- and upper-middle-income populations. Individuals should strive to incorporate more intense physical activity into their routines, such as brisk walking or other forms of aerobic exercise.""

Science frequently benefits from teams of interdisciplinary researchers1–3, but many scientists do not have easy access to experts from multiple fields4,5. While large language models (LLMs) have shown an impressive ability to aid researchers across diverse domains, their uses have been largely limited to answering specific scientific questions rather than performing open-ended research6–11. Here, we expand the capabilities of LLMs for science by introducing the Virtual Lab, an AI-human research collaboration to perform sophisticated, interdisciplinary science research. The Virtual Lab consists of an LLM principal investigator agent guiding a team of LLM scientist agents through a series of research meetings, with a human researcher providing high-level feedback. We apply the Virtual Lab to design nanobody binders to recent variants of SARS-CoV-2. The Virtual Lab creates a novel computational nanobody design pipeline that incorporates ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta and designs 92 new nanobodies. Experimental validation reveals a range of functional nanobodies with promising binding profiles across SARS-CoV-2 variants. In particular, two new nanobodies exhibit improved binding to the recent JN.1 or KP.3 variants12,13 while maintaining strong binding to the ancestral viral spike protein, suggesting exciting candidates for further investigation. This demonstrates how the Virtual Lab can rapidly make an impactful, real-world scientific discovery.

Brain areas that help to monitor the envelope of space close to a person help to fire up immune cells when infection threatens. Credit: Zephyr/Science Photo Library

The brain activates front-line immune cells in response to the mere sight of a sick person, mimicking the body's response to an actual infection, a study shows1.

The results required the use of brain scans and blood tests, as well as less conventional technology: gaming kit. Study volunteers donned virtual reality (VR) headsets to view human avatars with rashes, coughs or other symptoms of illness — avoiding the need to expose volunteers to pathogens.

The results illustrate the power of the brain “to predict what is going on [and] to select the proper response”, says study co-author Andrea Serino, a neuroscientist at the University Hospital of Lausanne, Switzerland.

The study was published 28 July in Nature Neuroscience.

The immune system reacts promptly to infections, but it can't always move fast enough to prevent serious illness. That means it would be useful for the body to realize that an infection is possible and mount a pre-emptive response.

To study humans' ability to anticipate a pathogen attack, Serino and his colleagues outfitted healthy volunteers with Google's Oculus Rift headsets and showed them avatars that approached closer and closer, although the avatars never ‘touched' the participants. Some avatars showed signs of having an infectious illness; others were controls that looked healthy.

Optical control of electron spin states is important for quantum sensing and computing applications, as developed with the diamond nitrogen vacancy centre. This requires electronic excitations, excitons, with net spin. Here we report a molecular diradical where two trityl radical groups are coupled via a meta-linked fluorene bridge. The singlet exciton is at lower energy than the triplet because electron transfer from one of the radical non-bonding orbitals to the other is spin allowed, set by the charging energy for the double occupancy of the non-bonding level, the Hubbard U. Both excitons give efficient photoluminescence at 640 and 700 nm with near unity efficiency. The ground state exchange energy is low, 60 µeV, allowing control of ground state spin populations. We demonstrate spin-selective intersystem crossing and show coherent microwave control. We report up to 8% photoluminescence contrast at microwave resonance. This tuning of the singlet Mott–Hubbard exciton against the ‘bandgap' exciton provides a new design platform for spin–optical materials.

Coupled correlated spin systems form the basis of a wide range of electronic phenomena, from cuprate superconductors1 to materials developed for quantum information and sensing2. Molecular semiconductors, as used in organic light emitting displays, use closed shell electronic structures, where strong Coulomb interactions give rise to large spin exchange energies separating singlet and triplet excitons. Here, we explore a parallel opportunity to engineer correlated molecular semiconductors with ‘open shell' spin radical building units that are brought into contact through covalent intramolecular coupling. With coupling selected to keep spins localized to their parent molecular unit, such extended structures behave as Mott–Hubbard insulators3. As we develop below, this structure has spin-specific excitations, and for our materials, these are optically controllable.

Optical initialization and read-out of spin states has been of growing interest to the emerging field of quantum technologies with implications in quantum computing4,5, communication6, teleportation7 and sensing8. This spin–optical interface and its applications have been demonstrated through solid-state defects9,10,11. In molecular organo-metallic systems, it is possible to create an open-shell, non-zero net spin, ground state, and this has been explored to successfully create spin–optical interfaces12,13. Fully organic systems offer geometric and spatial control through readily accessible synthetic chemistry methods. There are reports of coherent control over photoexcited high spin states14,15,16,17, spin-singlet-based quantum optics18 and long coherence times19, but these are from weakly luminescent systems so that optical read-out is limited. The materials we report here show spin dependent luminescence, critically with near unity luminescence yields. We note recent reports of trityl diradical systems20,21,22 that show emission from coupled spin states that we discuss later in this study and which are compared in Supplementary Table 2.

Carbon-centred chlorinated trityl monoradicals (TTMs), coupled to electron donors such as carbazole, provide a family of efficient luminescent radicals23,24,25,26,27,28 that show promise as light emitters in red and near-IR LEDs. These show emission from excitons in the doublet manifold, and this avoids dark triplet states found in closed shell systems currently used in organic light emitting displays. High photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQE) is essential for any practical optical read-out or writing of a quantum system. Generally, PLQE for molecular semiconductors is much reduced with intermolecular interactions. However, we have found that high PLQE can be maintained in TTM radical systems brought into intramolecular contact. This allows bright multispin excitons and unlocks new opportunities for spin–optical control.

Our starting point is the finding of luminescence-preserving intermolecular energy exchange between emissive doublet excitons and triplet excitons supported in a molecular semiconductor host29,30, and we have used this to engineer LED performance. Moving to intramolecular extended structures, we reported high-spin photogenerated excitons for structures where the TTM radical molecular unit is covalently attached to an anthracene31. In the ground state, there is no spin interaction with the anthracene, and when a second TTM is attached to the other side of the anthracene, only a doublet electron spin resonance (ESR) response is seen, demonstrating that there is no spin interaction between the two radicals. However, on photoexcitation, high-spin quartet (monoradical) and quintet spin state (biradical) excitons are photogenerated due to coupling to a triplet exciton on the anthracene (selected because it is energy degenerate with the doublet exciton). Spin manipulation is possible in the excited state, and optical read-out via the doublet emission is achieved by reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) to the doublet, which is the only emissive exciton. Note that this does not provide opportunity to manipulate the overall ground state spin nor to read out the ground state from photoluminescence (PL)31.

There is current interest in diradical systems, ranging from weak coupling20,21 through to systems with strong conjugation where the ground state is closed shell (termed diradicaloid)32,33,34. We report here organic diradicals using two TTM radicals coupled with a molecular bridge. The coupling of adjacent localized spin sites, through a transfer energy t, is usually described by the Mott–Hubbard model, where the excitation gap is the electrostatic charging energy for double occupancy of a spin site, termed the Hubbard U. The coupling t sets up antiferromagnetic exchange, J = 2t2/U (refs. 35,36). Although the Hubbard U is generally considered the energy barrier for carrier transport, we show here that it also sets the energy for the spin singlet photoexcitation. The strength of t can be controlled by the nature of the bridging unit, and we have recently reported strong coupling using cyclopentadithiophene units to give strong infrared absorption37. Here, we have tuned the interradical transfer energy to a low value, of order a few millielectron volt, using a meta-linked fluorene unit that maintains alternant symmetry, as shown in Fig. 1a.

Photoexcitation in the spin triplet manifold is constrained to similar non-bonding to π/π* ‘bandgap' excitations as for the monoradicals, but in the singlet manifold, the lowest energy singlet exciton involves electron transfer from one of the radical non-bonding orbitals to the other, to form a zwitterionic exciton, as illustrated in Fig. 1b,c. It is the Hubbard U that sets the energy of the singlet exciton, and for this molecule, its energy is red-shifted from the triplet exciton. This differentiation of zwitterionic singlet from covalent triplet is critical.

Measurements presented here were carried out in dilute solutions (100 µM solutions of toluene) or in spin-coated thin films of polystyrene where the diradical concentration was ≤0.1 wt%. Polystyrene serves as a non-polar host in which the diradical can be dispersed uniformly. We find it necessary to keep these diradical molecules well separated through dilution to prevent intermolecular energy and spin transfers. At these concentrations, the aggregation effects are unimportant (Supplementary Information Section 12). The samples for PL-detected magnetic resonance (PLDMR) were prepared by doping diradicals at 1 nM concentration into 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene crystals.

Figure 2a shows the absorption and PL spectrum of 100 mM toluene solution of M2TTM-3Flr-M2TTM. We note that this diradical has approximate alternant symmetry that imposes electron-hole symmetry38,39 so that the lowest absorption band has similar but opposing contributions from π → non-bonding and non-bonding → π* transitions. The diradical shows efficient PL, red-shifted from the monoradical (Supplementary Fig. 6), with a peak emission at 640 nm and PLQE above 90%. We note that there is a second peak in the PL near 700 nm, which, very importantly, is not just a vibronic overtone but is due to a spin-singlet excited state, while the 640 nm feature is due to a spin triplet excited state. The distinction between these two emission bands is most easily seen in magnetic-field-dependent PL, measurements at low temperatures, as shown in Fig. 2b. In brief, at 0.25 K, the ground state is a spin singlet (with emission at 700 nm) but with an applied magnetic field (above 0.6 T), the ground state switches to the triplet and the emission at 640 nm is from the triplet exciton.

The differentiation between the singlet and triplet excitons is at the core of our results. The triplet exciton is red-shifted from the monoradical by 0.1 eV, (Supplementary Fig. 4b), but the energy of the zwitterionic singlet exciton is given by a Hubbard U and is further red-shifted. We observe that the energy of the singlet PL (700 nm, 1.8 eV) matches the difference in energy between the electrochemical potentials for reduction at −1.2 V (versus Fc/Fc+) to the anion and for oxidation at 0.6 V to the cation, shown in Supplementary Fig. 4. The origin of high PLQEs in some of the radical donor–acceptor systems has been explored by Ghosh et al.40. In this model, electron-hole separation to vibrationally decoupled molecular fragments in the zwitterionic singlet exciton is responsible for the high PL yield in spite of the long radiative lifetime.

Figure 2c shows the temperature-dependent PL intensity in 0.1 wt% spin-coated thin films of the 640 and 700 nm peaks in the 300–0.6 K regime. The 700 nm PL increases while the 640 nm PL decreases at lower temperatures, although the integrated-PL intensity does not change (Supplementary Fig. 13). The slope of the curves changes twice: first at ~120 K and second at ~1.0 K. We first assign the initial slope-change event to the thermal energy of the system falling below the activation energy for rISC and second when it falls below the antiferromagnetic exchange energy of the diradical.

Figure 2d shows time-resolved PL measurements at 200 K on the 0.1 wt% doped polystyrene films. The M2TTM-3Flr-M2TTM diradical shows emission from the triplet, peaked at 640 nm, with a fast lifetime of 10 ns and slower emission from the singlet, peaked near 700 nm, with a delayed lifetime of 100 ns and beyond. Analysis of emission before and after 50 ns shows about equal contributions from the triplet and singlet spectra (Supplementary Fig. 8). Although the initial decay of the 640 nm feature is fast it shows a temperature-dependent long-lived component, and this slow component has an activation energy around 10 meV (Supplementary Fig. 12). We consider the slow component of the 640 nm emission to be due to rISC. We note that we are fortunate to observe efficient singlet emission even though it is slow, but nevertheless, we are not able to measure absorption from the spin-singlet ground state, S0 to the first spin-singlet excited state, S1 because the oscillator strength is low.

Figure 2e shows kinetic traces of the main peaks obtained from transient optical absorption spectroscopy. A detailed report and analysis of transient optical absorption studies is provided in Supplementary Information Section 6, and associated quantum chemical modelling is provided in Supplementary Information Section 10.6. In summary, the photoinduced absorption (PIA) bands near 520 nm (2.05 eV) and 1,330 nm (0.93 eV) are associated with the triplet exciton before charge separation26. The PIA bands centred at 610 nm (2.28 eV) and 1,270 nm (0.98 eV) build up over the first 3 ns and are associated to the absorption of the zwitterionic singlet exciton formed after charge separation. The kinetics of the PIA bands associated with the exciton before and after charge separation are in agreement with the kinetics of the 640 and 700 nm PL peaks, respectively. The triplet and singlet PIA features cross over before 1 ns; this can be attributed to the intersystem crossing (ISC) process.

Figures 2b and 3a,b show magneto-optical studies. We find that the 640 and 700 nm emission features are strongly dependent on applied magnetic field (Fig. 2b). In the ground state, the two spins, localized on each of the M2TTMs, are weakly antiferromagnetically coupled, as shown in the temperature-dependent magnetization curves in Fig. 3a, with an antiferromagnetic exchange energy near 1 K. This is also captured using PL through the rise in 700 nm and fall in 640 nm emission below 1.2 K, shown in Fig. 2c. In summary, the 700 nm emission dominates at zero field, where only the singlet state is occupied at low temperatures, and as the field is raised above 0.6 T where the Zeeman energy exceeds the exchange energy, the triplet becomes predominantly occupied, and the 640 nm emission dominates. We associate this with a magnetic spin triplet ground state. Figure 3b shows evidence for a resonance where the Zeeman energy equals the ground state exchange energy. In the region close to exchange, we obtain PL spectra that are linear combinations of the singlet and triplet PL which are proportional their relative populations (Supplementary Figs. 17 and 18).

Source data

We note that the field and temperature-dependent PL matches the magnetization measurements shown in Fig. 3a. This establishes that the two emissions are associated with the magnetization of the sample arising from the two possible overall spin states, namely singlet at 700 nm and triplet at 640 nm.

We have assembled a photophysical model with the available experimental information in Fig. 1d. We can assume that the initial photoexcitation occurs via fluorene π/π* to non-bonding transitions due to the similarity of the absorption spectrum of the diradical to the monoradical (Supplementary Fig. 6). These new states can be of either singlet or triplet multiplicity, denoted as S1 and T1 respectively. Extension of the exciton to both radical units will be dependent on molecular geometry, and Fig. 1b illustrates the singlet with zwitterionic character. We have explored this by running extensive time-dependent density functional theory calculations on the M2TTM-3Flr-M2TTM diradical paying particular attention to the role of dielectric and geometric relaxation (Supplementary Information Section X. The approximate electron-hole symmetry yields a T1 triplet exciton with finite oscillator strength (the state involves dominant CT excitation between the fluorene and the TTM) translating into a radiative lifetime of ~20 ns, irrespective of the dielectric constant and in reasonable agreement with experiment. By contrast, the S1 singlet state radiative decay is very sensitive to both dielectric and geometric (mostly conformational) relaxation effects. This is because the zwitterionic singlet state acquires finite oscillator strength only through wave function mixing with the singlet counterpart of the 3CT excitation, and such mixing varies strongly with their energy separation. Thus, the quasipure zwitterionic state, as formed after full dielectric (at e = 2.37 or above) relaxation, has a vanishingly small oscillator strength and a radiative lifetime larger than 1 μs. By relaxing only the optical part of the dielectric response at n2 ≈ 2 (where n is the refractive index of the medium), we instead obtain a hybrid zwitterionic-1CT state with radiative lifetime of ~50 ns in the Franck–Condon region and of ~200 ns when relaxing only the high-frequency contribution of the lattice relaxation (thus freezing the conformation of the molecule to that of the ground state), rates bracketing the measured value. Full conformational relaxation brings the S1 state further down in energy, resulting again in a radiative lifetime in the microsecond range. We consider this is either at least partly alleviated by steric effects in the solid phase or that thermal fluctuations allow populating higher-energy conformations and/or local dielectric environments where finite zwitterionic-CT mixing occurs.

This zwitterionic singlet exciton is a very unusual excitation for a molecular semiconductor, but its excitation energy, the Hubbard U, is a very well recognized quantity for many inorganic oxides. There is extensive literature on Mott–Hubbard models for transition metal oxides, including superconducting cuprates and nickelates1. In general, the Hubbard U is typically above 2 eV and is larger than other electronic excitations, such as metal to oxygen charge transfer. There has been little consideration about optical absorption and emission to and from the Mott–Hubbard charge transfer state, but there is a recent report on ‘Hubbard excitons' in SrIrO4 (ref. 41). For our organic radical systems we are able to bring the Hubbard U below the lowest interband exciton, and it is this that allows us to observe the Mott–Hubbard exciton through its PL. The special feature of our studied material is the efficient dual fluorescence from both the triplet and singlet excited states with near unity quantum yield. Matsuoka et al.21 report evidence for singlet emission associated with magneto-PL (MPL) in a weakly luminescent diradical system but do not identify the singlet exciton as zwitterionic. We have explored other systems with different bridging units, including carbazole, presented in detail in the Supplementary Information. These show no evidence for PL from singlet excitons. The carbazole-linked system shown in Supplementary Fig. 5 is very similar to that reported by Mizuno et al.20 and shows only triplet emission. This is also the case for a recently reported phenyl-linked system22.

Since the ground state exchange energy is low (~0.8 K), we expect a 3:1 ratio of triplet:singlet ground states down to low temperatures. We observe however that the ratio of triplet to singlet PL near 300 K is closer to 1:1 (noting that the overall PLQE is >90%) and consider this must arise through ISC from triplet to singlet. The TA evolution shown in Fig. 2e shows this happens beyond 100 ps. We assign the thermally activated delayed emission at 640 nm to rISC, from the S1 to the T1 state (we note also that the energy of the emitted photon does not capture the full internal energy of the singlet exciton, and we consider there is a conformational energy contribution to the singlet exciton that is not available for photon emission). These observations of competing singlet and triplet excitation and de-excitation pathways, alongside evidence for ISC and rISC, sets up scope for photoexcited spin polarization in the ground state.

We carried out ground and excited-state ESR measurements, on 0.1 wt% doped polystyrene thin films containing M2TTM-3Flr-M2TTM (see the Supplementary Information for 50 µM toluene solutions). In the dark, continuous-wave ESR (cwESR) measurements at 298 K (Fig. 4a) shows clear evidence for triplets with full-field |Δms| = 1 transitions which could be simulated with D = 30.3 MHz and E = 1.6 MHz. Further confirmation of a ground state triplet state is given by the observation of a |Δms| = 2 transition at half field.

Ground state pulsed ESR was performed, and the resulting echo-detected field sweep (EDFS) shows two peaks, due to the T−1 → T0 and T0 → T+1 transitions (Fig. 4b). Echo decay measurements at the two peak positions behave similarly; an exponential decay fit (Supplementary Figs. 46 and 47) gives the phase memory time, Tm, of 950 ns. The long Tm is comparable with that of a perchlorotriphenylmethyl monoradical42. Inversion recovery experiments show that the T1 (spin-lattice) relaxation time is 31.8 μs. As Tm is clearly not limited by T1, creating a nuclear-spin free environment could further increase the Tm (ref. 43).

One critical component for molecular systems to be utilized in quantum information applications is the ability coherently manipulate the spin state44. Rabi nutation experiments shown in Fig. 4c, show the ability of this system to be coherently driven between two states with multiple oscillations seen at room temperature under relatively low microwave powers. We also observe an expected linear shift in the Rabi-oscillation frequency with increasing microwave power, shown in Fig. 4d.

Transient ESR (trESR) was measured with a 532 nm, 5 ns pulsed photoexcitation. Figure 4e shows spectra measured at different times after excitation. At the timescales shown here, we consider the dominant response to arise from non-thermal spin sublevel populations in the electronic ground state formed by the decay of photogenerated excitons. We note here that the triplet luminescence response has an initial decay time of 10 ns. At 100 ns and 1 µs, two emissive features are observed, which we consider arise from sublevel transitions in the triplet state, with preferential population in the T0 and T+ sublevels. This indicates either preferential filling of the T0/T+ or depopulation of the T− spin-levels, the latter via ISC in the excited state to the singlet with spin sublevel selective transition probabilities. At 10 µs, the spectra show a broad absorptive feature and beyond 50 µs this ESR feature reverses sign to become emissive and is measurable beyond 200 µs (Fig. 4f). A similar trESR response is found in frozen solution spectra at 150 K, with the only difference being the initial emissive feature to much more pronounced (see Supplementary Figs. 48 and 49 for two-dimensional maps). Note that the 5 ns pulse excitation (100 Hz repetition rate) is shorter than the PL lifetime and precludes spin pumping via re-excitation. A possible mechanism for the sign reversal (Fig. 4e) is spin sublevel selective excited-state depopulation6,45. The later time sign reversal shown in Fig. 4e,f is very unusual, and we consider requires spin repopulation from an excited-state reservoir46. A possible mechanism to provide this repopulation channel is by rISC from the reservoir of long-lived excited-state singlets which persists to these timescales at 200 K (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 11). We confirm the long-lived photogenerated spin polarization beyond 50 µs to be due to overpopulation of the ground state T+ sublevel by simulation of the late-time trESR spectra where we require a ground state triplet population, p(Ti), distribution of p(T+) > p(T0) = p(T−1) but with the same D and E parameters as for the cwESR dark spectrum.

Ground-state spin polarization mediated by a spin–optical interface can be revealed in PLDMR measurements. We explore a range of PLDMR conditions in Fig. 5. The Zeeman energy exceeds D above 2.8 mT, so at X-band (Fig. 5a) and D-band (Fig. 5b), the triplet levels are set by the applied B||z fields (Fig. 5c). At 100 K and X-band ESR conditions, in Fig. 5a, we see that the PLDMR recorded in the range 590–650 nm shows a contrast >10−3%. We report low temperature wavelength-resolved PLDMR under D-band conditions in Fig. 5b, showing suppression of the triplet emission and enhanced singlet emission at magnetic resonance. The PLDMR transition is large with ΔPL/PL contrast ~10% and has a narrow 2 mT spectral width, shown in Supplementary Fig. 35, reminiscent of the dark-cwESR spectrum of the diradical. This behaviour arises due to preferential spin-selective ISC from the ms = 0 sublevel of the triplet excited state to the S1 state, as shown in Fig. 5c, which is turned on by microwave pumping at resonance by the spin sublevel T−1 → T0 transition in the ground state before photoexcitation (see Supplementary Information Section 5 for more details). The mechanistic insights for the quantum mechanical origins of PLDMR responses from alternant diradicals has also been recently and independently explored by Poh et al.47. The size of the PLDMR response is relatively agnostic to microwave and laser excitation power (Supplementary Figs. 35 and 36) but scales with sample magnetization following a Curie-like law, as seen in Supplementary Fig. 34.

At Bz > 0.7 T and T < 0.8 K the ms = −1 sublevel in the ground state triplet is occupied, which has a small ISC probability. Bz is the static magnetic field applied along the z-axis. When microwaves are switched on (right), a microwave-induced Δms = 1 transition drives population from ms = −1 to ms = 0 within the ground state. This ms = 0 sublevel has a higher probability for ISC in the excited state, which leads to more singlet PL and reduced triplet PL, manifest as a large PLDMR contrast. The samples for a were thin films made with 0.1 wt% M2TTM-3Flr-M2TTM doped into polystyrene, and in b, we doped 10 nM of M2TTM-3Flr-M2TTM into PhCl3 crystal. The crystals were prepared using slow evaporation of a solution, which were subsequently washed and polished, as described in Supplementary Information Section 13.

In summary, the special feature of our meta-fluorene-bridged diradical is its distinct optically accessible and optically distinguishable triplet and singlet excitons, both with near unity PLQE. This arises because the lowest energy singlet exciton is a bright zwitterionic excitation, with energy set by the onsite Hubbard U. This, along with other recent studies20,21,48, opens up a new set of molecular semiconductors with a large set of potential areas for application, particularly for quantum sensing and transport. We have demonstrated that we can ‘read' the ground spin state: singlet or triplet. We have also shown that we can ‘write'—through the Zeeman energy with applied magnetic field and, more broadly, through spin-selective ISC and rISC following optical excitation.

This approach to spin control is relevant to the operational principles of optical qubits such as single-photon-emitting high spin defects in c-Si, diamond or h-BN. In contrast to such defects, where placement and thus large scale entanglement is difficult49 because there is no direct control of defect organization, there is real scope for designed open-shell, highly luminescent, carbon-based molecular spin–optical systems, as exemplified here for the M2TTM-3Flr-M2TTM diradical. We consider the advances reported here provide a strong and unexpected basis for further developments for optically controlled qubit platforms.

Ultraviolet/visible/NIR spectra were measured with a commercially available Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotometer and a Shimadzu UV-1800 spectrophotometer. The PL was measured in a home-built setup by providing a continuous-wave excitation at 532 nm using a diode laser. PL is collected in a reflection mode setup after passing photons through a 550 long-pass filter (Thorlabs). The transmitted photons then are collected in a collimating two-lens apparatus and directed into an optical fibre, which supplies the photons into a calibrated grating spectrometer (Andor SR-303i) and finally into a Si-camera where it is recorded. Output spectra are corrected, taking into account the filter transmission and camera sensitivity. The excitation spectra were measured with a commercially available Edinburgh Instruments FS5 Spectrofluorometer system using a xenon lamp light source. When solution samples are studied, 100 mm pathlength Hellma quartz cuvettes were used.

Cyclic voltammetry measurements were carried out on a PalmSens EmStat4S potentiostat in a three-electrode setup using a glassy carbon electrode (3.0 mm diameter) as the working electrode, platinum wire as the counter electrode and freshly activated silver wire as the Ag/Ag+ reference electrode. The silver wire was activated by immersing in concentrated HCl solution to remove any silver oxides and other impurities, then rinsed with water and acetone and dried before each measurement. The reference electrode was calibrated against ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple at the end of each measurement. The Fc/Fc+ half-wave potential, E1/2, was determined at 0.20 V versus Ag/Ag+ in THF electrolyte and at 0.50 V versus Ag/Ag+ in DCM electrolyte. The supporting electrolyte was 0.1 M solution of Bu4NPF6 in THF (anhydrous) and in DCM (anhydrous). The scan rate was 0.1 V s−1. The electrolyte was bubbled with Ar gas before each measurement to remove any dissolved oxygen. The sample concentration was in the order of 10−5 M.

Steady-state PLQE measurements were performed using an integrating sphere. A continuous-wave 405 nm excitation is provided by a 405 nm diode laser with excitation powers of 10–300 mW cm−2. A focussed beam of diameter 1,000 μm was used to excite the samples. The emission was directed using an optical fibre in a calibrated grating spectrometer (Andor SR-303i) onto a Si-camera.

The studied solution samples are irradiated using an electrically pulsed 405 nm laser using a function generator at a frequency of 20 MHz providing a time resolution of up to 100 ns. The photons emitted from the sample were passed through a 405 nm long-pass filter (Thorlabs) to remove the laser scatter. The subsequently transmitted photons are then collected by a Si-based single-photon avalanche photodiode. The instrument response function was found to be ~0.1 ns in this setup.

Transient PL spectra at nanosecond-microsecond timescales were recorded using an electronically gated intensified charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (Andor iStar DH740 CCI-010) connected to a calibrated grating spectrometer (Andor SR-303i). A narrowband noncolinear optical parametric amplifier pumped with a frequency-doubled output of a 1 kHz 800 nm laser pulse from a Ti:sapphire amplifier was used to generate a tunable 250-fs excitation pulse. Suitable long-pass filters (Edmund Optics) were used to prevent scattered laser signals from entering the spectrometer. Temporal evolution of the PL emission was obtained by stepping the intensified CCD delay with respect to the excitation pulse, with a minimum gate width of 5 ns. The raw data were corrected to account for filter transmission and camera sensitivity.

In the same setup, we measured magnetic field effects on the PL and electroluminescence. where the sub-1T magnetic field was generated using an electromagnet from GMW Model 3470 with a 1 cm distance between cylindrical poles, and the field strength was calibrated with a Gaussmeter.

Transient absorption experiments were conducted on a setup pumped by a regenerative Ti:sapphire amplifier (Solstice Ace, Spectra-Physics) emitting 100-fs pulses centred at 800 nm at a rate of 1 kHz and a total output of 7 W. Depending on the probed spectral range and timescales, different combinations of optical systems were used.

To collect subnanosecond dynamics in the visible range, frequency-doubled output of the amplifier was used to seed a home-built broadband non-collinear optical parametric amplifier (NOPA) tuned to output 540–750 nm pulses with a beta barium borate mixing crystal (Eksma Optics). Following chirp-correction the white light output was split on a 50/50 beam splitter, focused to below 200 μm and used as the probe and reference beams. Wavelength-tuneable pump pulses were generated in a home-built visible narrowband NOPA. Alternatively, to probe the infrared range the output of the amplifier was used to seed a home-built NOPA tuned to output 1,250–1,700 nm pulses with a periodically poled stoichiometric lithium tantalate mixing crystal. The pump and probe beams were spatially overlapped at the focal point using a beam profiler, with the pump spot diameter at least fivefold larger than the probe. Time resolution was achieved by the introduction of a stepped optical delay (Thorlabs DDS300-E/M) between pump and probe pulses, with a computer-controlled delay stage allowing for maximum delay of 1.9 ns and beam wander of the probe due to changing beam pointing minimized to below 5 μm using a beam profiler. The pump pulses were chopped at 500 Hz to enable shot-to-shot referencing, which accounted for intensity fluctuations in the amplifier. After passing through the sample, the probe and reference beams were dispersed with a grating spectrometer (Shamrock SR-303i, Andor Technology) and simultaneously measured with CCD detector arrays (Entwicklungsbüro Stresing).

To collect subnanosecond dynamics in the ultraviolet range, the output of the amplifier was used to seed a home-built broadband NOPA tuned to output 350–650 nm pulses generated by focusing the 800 nm fundamental beam onto a CaF2 crystal (Eksma Optics, 5 mm) connected to a digital motion controller (Mercury C-863 DC Motor Controller), after passing through a mechanical delay stage. The transmitted pulses were collected with a single-line scan camera (JAI SW-4000M-PMCL) after passing through a spectrograph (Andor Shamrock SR-163).

The excited-state analysis on the diradical M2TTM-3Flr-M2TTM was carried out at the time-dependent density functional theory level within the Tamm–Dancoff approximation and by resorting to the screening range-separation hybrid approach, as described in earlier works50. In particular, the LC-ωhPBE functional51 was used in combination with the cc-pVDZ basis set. For such an approach, the ω parameter was optimally tuned, where α + β = 1/ε, with α and β being adjustable parameters and ε the dielectric constant of the chosen medium. All the calculations were performed by using the Gaussian16 suit of packages in its revision A.03 (ref. 52).

Global analysis was performed using the sum of weighted components analysis where the spectrum is, at a first approximation, expressed as an i-term linear sum of spectral components φi (λ):

Each ith spectral component is weighted by a time-varying weight prefactor computed from its associated lifetime τi given by \({{\mathrm{e}}}^{-t/{\tau }_{i}}\). This equation can be cast into a n × m matrix using the method described by Dorhliac et al.53. This is a matrix consisting of n-reduced weight singular vectors (represented by (US)n) that can completely reconstruct the experimental data matrix. The matrix formalism equation is then written as

where the time-varying exponential weight matrix is given by \(E(\vec{\tau })\) and X is the wavelength-dependent weight matrix; the dimensions of each term is given in the subscript. A simulated annealing algorithm54 used for global minimization routines is then used to determine which lifetimes ti can best satisfy the matrix equation. The determined lifetimes from the optimization are then inserted into the matrix equation, and then, it is solved for X by solving the least-square problem55

The magnetic susceptibility measurements were carried out in a Quantum Design SQUID MPMS3 Magnetometer. The samples were in the form of polycrystalline powders, about 8 mg, which were packed into a diamagnetic capsule.

The MPL measurements were carried out on Bluefors dry dilution refrigerator with a superconductive vector magnet from American Magnetics Model. The samples were installed on a gold-coated copper plate and cooled down to 250 mK. The excitation source was a 405 nm (3.06 eV) laser stabilized through a (proportional-integral-differential) PID loop, which was also used to provide power amplitude modulation at 1.2 kHz. A fibre was used to guide the excitation to the sample (excitation power of around 20 nW, 50 µW cm−2) and to collect the fluorescence signal. The magnetic field was swept from 0 to 9 T with a ramping speed of 0.1 T min−1. The MPL variation at a particular wavelength was collected using an avalanche photodiode (Thorlabs) placed behind a monochromator (HORIBA iHR320) with lock-in detection at the power amplitude modulation frequency.

The measurements were conducted in a Bluefors dry dilution refrigerator with a superconductive vector magnet from American Magnetics Model. The optical setup was identical to the MPL measurement. A quartz whispering mode gallery resonator was used to enhance the AC magnetic field without increasing the power input into the system. The sample was mounted on top of a sapphire cold finger within 1 mm from the surface of the disc resonator near its the perimeter to maximize the AC magnetic field. The Q-factor of the resonator was >103, with some reductions attributed to the holder sample and excitation/collection fibre assembly. The mm-wave setup was inspired by the design for the study of the microwave-response from rotons in superfluid helium56.

The cwESR spectra were recorded at X-band frequencies (∼9.4 GHz) using a laboratory-built ESR spectrometer. The magnetic field was regulated using a Bruker BH15 field controller and monitored with a Bruker ER 035 M NMR Gaussmeter while a Bruker ER 041 MR microwave bridge (with a ER 048 R microwave controller) was used for microwave generation and detection (diode detection). The static magnetic field was modulated at 100 kHz, and lock-in detection was carried out using a Stanford Research SR810 lock-in amplifier in combination with a Wangine WPA-120 audio amplifier. The lock-in detection leads to the derivative spectra. A Bruker ER 4122 SHQE microwave resonator was used. The g-factor calibration was additionally done using a N@C60 powder sample at room temperature, with a known g-factor (g = 2.00204). The inner wall film sample of M2TTM-3Flr-M2TTM was measured at room temperature with a modulation amplitude of 0.05 mT and a microwave power of 3.2 μW for the main transition and 12.6 mW for the half-field transition. Simulations of the cwESR spectrum were done using the EasySpin toolbox57, version 6.0.0-dev.53 and the pepper function. The half-field transition was scaled to account for the difference in microwave power used.

Pulse ESR was performed at X-band (9.7 GHz) using a Bruker ELEXSYS E580 spectrometer, with a Bruker MD5 resonator. All measurements were at room temperature in the dark.

The echo-detected field sweep was performed using the Hahn echo sequence \(\frac{\pi }{2}-\tau -\pi -\tau -\) echo, with pulse lengths of tπ/2 = 160 ns and tπ = 320 ns, an interpulse delay τ of 400 ns, a two-step phase cycle and an echo integration window of 518 ns. The longer pulses were used to supress ESEEM effects.

The Rabi nutation trace was recorded with a three-pulse sequence of \(\theta -5\,\upmu {\mathrm{s}}-\frac{\pi }{2}-\tau -\pi -\tau -\) echo, where θ is a variable length pulse that is incremented. The nutation trace was recorded at the most intense peak in the EDFS at 345.62mT with different relative B1 strengths (attenuations of 29, 26 and 20 dB).

The phase memory time was measured with an echo decay measurement with a pulse sequence \(\frac{\pi }{2}-\tau -\pi -\tau -\) echo, where τ was incremented from 400 ns to 4.4 μs in steps of 2 ns (tπ/2 = 160 ns and tπ = 320 ns). We fit the echo decay with a mono-exponential curve to extract the Tm time.

The T1 (spin-lattice) relaxation time was measured with a saturation recovery sequence, where 20, 24-ns picket fence pulses were used to saturate the transition followed by a delay and a Hahn echo detection sequence with tπ/2 = 16 ns and tπ = 32 ns and an integration window of 112 ns. We find the saturation recovery trace can be fit with a mono-exponential curve.

The field calibration was carried out using N@C60.

The trESR experiments were performed on a laboratory-built X-band (9.7 GHz) continuous-wave spectrometer together with a Bruker MD5 dielectric ring resonator with optical access. Optical excitation at 532 nm was provided using a diode-pumped Nd:YAG laser (Atum Laser Titan AC compact 15 MM) equipped with a second harmonic generator, with an incident pulse energy of ∼400 μJ, a pulse length of 5 ns and operating at a 100 Hz repetition rate. Excitation also included a depolarizer (DPP25-A, Thorlabs) to avoid polarization effects. The temperature was controlled using a Lakeshore 332 temperature controller and a laboratory-built helium flow cryostat. The transients were recorded as the static magnetic field was swept, and continuous-wave microwave irradiation was applied (the samples were measured with a microwave power of 12.6 μW). trESR on M2TTM-3Flr-M2TTM was measured at 150 K for frozen solution of 0.1 wt% in PMMA in toluene, just below the melting point of toluene, and at 200 K for the inner wall films made of 0.1 wt% in PMMA.

PLDMR was performed using a home-built optical resonator (based on a dielectric ring resonator), which allows for excitation of the sample and collection of PL in transmission mode). A 365 nm LED (M365L3 Thorlabs) was used for continuous excitation of the sample. The integrated PL from 400 to 650 nm was collected by a silicon detector. (The 365 nm excitation residual was removed via a 400 nm long-pass filter, while we used a 650 nm short pass filter to limit the range of wavelengths seen by the Si detector to be from 400–650 nm). The PLDMR was carried out at X-band, and the microwaves were square-wave modulated at a frequency of 967 Hz. The change in PL owing to microwave absorption was monitored at the microwave modulation frequency using lock-in detection (Stanford Research Systems SR830) as the static magnetic field was swept through resonance. The sample was measured at 100 K.

Programme such as the Thousand Talents Plan have brought thousands of researchers back to China.Credit: Li Ziheng/Xinhua/Alamy

Materials chemist Nan Liu took a career shortcut that many researchers can only dream of. She went from a postdoctoral position in the United States to a full professorship at a Chinese university with a research budget of 4 million yuan (US$560,000). Liu, now at Beijing Normal University, was recruited as part of the Thousand Young Talents Plan, a government-run initiative to bring talented overseas researchers back to China.

Over the past three decades, thousands of Chinese researchers who studied or worked abroad have returned to the country through similar talent-recruitment programmes. These recruits — who often receive substantial funding and benefits — have largely had a positive influence on China's research landscape and contributed to its global competitiveness, say scientists.

Studies have shown that returnees have helped to improve research quality, quantity and impact in China, says Lili Yang, who studies higher education at the University of Hong Kong. Many hold key positions in universities or government agencies.

But the funding and other advantages afforded to those recruited through talent programmes have caused some resentment among young Chinese researchers who remain in the country, says Jiang Li, who studies the science of science at Nanjing University in China. “They complain a lot.”

As China's global science standing has risen, and geopolitical tensions with the United States have intensified, recruitment programmes have increasingly been eyeing researchers who studied in China. 

Since the late 1990s, China has had several national-level talent recruitment programmes to attract overseas researchers, on top of hundreds of regional and local schemes. Among the largest and most prominent was the Thousand Talents Plan targeting leading researchers and entrepreneurs, which included a ‘youth' branch for those under 40.

A rough estimate suggests that by 2018, 16,000 scientists and high-tech entrepreneurs had been recruited through various programmes to return to China.

Researchers apply for these programmes after securing a job offer at a Chinese research institute. They typically receive a sign-up bonus of at least half a million yuan, and can access several million yuan in research funding from the government and their host institute. They are also given housing subsidies and preferential treatment when applying for grants.

Around the mid-2010s, participants in the Thousand Talents Plan became a target of US government agencies, who viewed the programme as a channel for stealing intellectual property and trade secrets, although confirmed cases were rare. The Chinese government has since renamed the programme to the High-End Foreign Talents Plan.

Researchers have tried to study the impact of China's talent programmes. A 2023 analysis showed that returnees who joined the youth talent programme between 2012 and 2014 published more papers than did their counterparts who stayed abroad1.

But the picture is more nuanced, say researchers. Broader studies of the scientific output of returnees, who can act as a proxy for the impact of those who returned through talent programmes, have found that they had a higher chance of being corresponding authors than did those who stayed abroad, but were less likely to publish in top-tier journals2. This, and other studies of talent recruits, suggest that returnees might not represent the highest level of international talent and are probably early in their careers, says Li, who was a co-author of the study.

A 2020 study showed that returnees authored papers that were more highly cited than those produced by their local counterparts and maintained strong publishing ties with their international colleagues3. They have “helped to raise China's profile”, says co-author Caroline Wagner, a science-policy specialist at the Ohio State University in Columbus.

But a more recent analysis of roughly 300 Chinese returnees found that their average citations per publication declined over the five years after their return4. Their number of international collaborators and international citations also dropped over time, statistics that point to the limits of what talent-recruitment policies can achieve, suggest the authors.

Resilience is a multifaceted concept that spans biological, psychological and social domains, and is critical for population health—particularly brain health. While most existing research originates from the global north, there is an urgent need to explore resilience in the majority world settings, where unique biological, exposomal, economic and sociocultural factors shape health. In this Review, we highlight resilience as a key modifier of brain health outcomes. We explore the biological correlates of resilience and the influence of the exposome. We propose future synergistic integrations of exposome, cultural reserve, community resilience, allostasis and whole-body health principles to promote an inclusive perspective in diverse settings. This approach is particularly relevant for majority world contexts, where resource constraints and cultural diversity demand adaptive, scalable and context-sensitive strategies. We discuss measurement approaches and operationalization strategies and, finally, we identify key priorities for future research and policy strategies, with an emphasis on local relevance, equity and sustainability.

A fundamental goal in genetics is to understand the connection between genotype and phenotype in health and disease. Genetic screens in which dozens to thousands of genetic elements are perturbed in a pooled fashion offer the opportunity to generate large-scale, information-rich and unbiased genotype–phenotype maps. Although typically applied in reductionist in vitro settings, methods enabling pooled CRISPR–Cas perturbation screening in vivo are gaining attention as they have the potential to accelerate the discovery and annotation of gene function across cells, tissues, developmental stages, disease states and species. In this Review, we discuss essential criteria for understanding, designing and implementing in vivo screening experiments, with a focus on pooled CRISPR-based screens in mice. We also highlight how the resulting datasets, combined with advances in multi-omics and artificial intelligence, will accelerate progress and enable fundamental discoveries across basic and translational sciences.

A study published in 2022 by a team including African scientists showed that, in Kenyan women aged 15–20, one dose of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is as effective as multiple doses (R. V. Barnabas et al. N. Engl. J. Med. Evid. 1, EVIDoa2100056; 2022). Vaccination is crucial for preventing HPV infections, the main cause of cervical cancer, which kills more than 300,000 people worldwide each year.

Owing to this and other similar findings, in 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that medical caregivers switch from giving girls and young women the standard of three doses of the HPV vaccine to just one or two, depending on availability. This has saved millions of lives by reducing the costs and logistical challenges of vaccination (K. Prem et al. BMC Med. 21, 313; 2023). Yet, I suspect that — as with many other notable contributions that African scientists have made to global knowledge — hardly anyone in Africa has heard about this research.

Science communication will benefit from research integrity standards

Science communication will benefit from research integrity standards

Across Africa, there are very few outlets for science journalism. I work in Kenya on infectious disease. Here, The Daily Nation, the country's most widely read newspaper, publishes a section on health just once a week, mainly highlighting health-care policies and reforms. Breaking news related to scientific discoveries appears only a handful of times a year.

Few journalists in Africa are trained in science. From what I've seen, even fewer researchers are trained in science communication.

Science-communication training has been offered in Europe and the United States for decades. Yet, in Kenya and many other African countries with considerable scientific output, such as Egypt, Nigeria and Uganda, no universities provide science-communication courses. (Training programmes are available in South Africa.)

Misinformation poses a bigger threat to democracy than you might think

Misinformation poses a bigger threat to democracy than you might think

To try to spur a nation-wide conversation about science communication in Kenya, I organized a workshop in Nairobi last year with the support of various partners, including the University of California, Santa Cruz, which offers a well-regarded science-communication programme. Before the workshop, many of the 40 participants hadn't even realized that a career in science communication was a possibility. This gap needs addressing.

During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya, conspiracy theories and misinformation spread rapidly through social media. Some religious leaders discouraged their congregants from wearing masks and getting vaccinated, thinking that the disease was a form of divine punishment for sinners. Conspiracy theories similarly spread across Uganda during its 2022 Ebola outbreak.

Currently, there is little climate-change denial in Kenya and other African nations. But as extreme weather events increasingly affect communities, there will be a higher risk of anti-climate messages being imported, particularly from the United States. In fact, some people received thousands of US dollars in donations — often from individuals with links to fossil-fuel interests — after posting debunked climate-change conspiracy theories.

Meta told employees that it is going to allow some coding job candidates to use an AI assistant during the interview process, according to internal Meta communications seen by 404 Media. The company has also asked existing employees to volunteer for a “mock AI-enabled interview,” the messages say.

It's the latest indication that Silicon Valley giants are pushing software engineers to use AI in their jobs, and it signals a broader move toward hiring employees who can vibecode as part of their jobs.

“AI-Enabled Interviews—Call for Mock Candidates,” a post from earlier this month on an internal Meta message board reads. “Meta is developing a new type of coding interview in which candidates have access to an AI assistant. This is more representative of the developer environment that our future employees will work in, and also makes LLM-based cheating less effective.”

“We need mock candidates,” the post continues. “If you would like to experience a mock AI-enabled interview, please sign up in this sheet. The questions are still in development; data from you will help shape the future of interviewing at Meta.”

This article was created in partnership with 404Media, a journalist-owned publication covering how technology impacts humans. For more stories like this, sign up here.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has made clear at numerous all-hands and in public podcast interviews that he is not just pushing the company's software engineers towards using AI in their work, but that he foresees human beings managing “AI coding agents” that will write code for the company.

“I think this year, probably in 2025, we at Meta as well as the other companies that are basically working on this, are going to have an AI that can effectively be a midlevel engineer that you have at your company that can write code,” Zuckerberg told Joe Rogan in January. “Over time we'll get to a point where a lot of the code in our apps and including the AI that we generate is actually going to be built by AI engineers instead of people engineers … In the future people are going to be so much more creative, and they're going to be freed up to do kind of crazy things.”

In April, Zuckerberg expanded on this slightly on a podcast with Dwarkesh Patel, where he said that “sometime in the next 12 to 18 months, we'll reach the point where most of the code that's going towards [AI] efforts is written by AI.”

While it's true that many tech companies have pushed software engineers to use AI in their work, they have been slower to allow new applicants to use AI during the interview process. In fact, Anthropic, which makes the AI tool Claude, has specifically told job applicants that they cannot use AI during the interview process. To circumvent that type of ban, some AI tools promise to allow applicants to secretly use AI during coding interviews. The topic, in general, has been a controversial one in Silicon Valley. Established software engineers worry that the next batch of coders will be more AI “prompters” and “vibecoders” than software engineers, and that they may not know how to troubleshoot AI-written code when something goes wrong.

“We're obviously focused on using AI to help engineers with their day-to-day work, so it should be no surprise that we're testing how to provide these tools to applicants during interviews,” a Meta spokesperson told 404 Media.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Meta's AI Recruiting Campaign Finds a New Target","https://www.wired.com/story/mark-zuckerberg-ai-recruiting-spree-thinking-machines/","Tue, 29 Jul 2025 16:10:00 GMT","

Mark Zuckerberg is on a warpath to recruit top talent in the AI field for his newly formed Meta Superintelligence Labs. After trying to gut OpenAI (and successfully poaching several top researchers), he appears to have set his sights on his next target.

More than a dozen people at Mira Murati's 50-person startup, Thinking Machines Lab, have been approached or received offers from the tech giant. (Murati, for those who don't remember, was previously the chief technology officer at OpenAI.) One of those offers was more than $1 billion over a multi-year span, a source with knowledge of the negotiations tells WIRED. The rest were between $200 million and $500 million over a four-year span, multiple sources confirm. In the first year alone, some staffers were guaranteed to make between $50 million and $100 million, sources say (a spokesperson for the lab declined to comment).

So far at Thinking Machines Lab, not a single person has taken the offer.

Meta communications director Andy Stone disputed this reporting in a statement to WIRED. “We made offers only to a handful of people at TML and while there was one sizable offer, the details are off,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, this all begs the question who is spinning this narrative and why.”

Zuckerberg's initial outreach is low-key, according to messages viewed by WIRED. In some cases, he sent recruits a direct message on WhatsApp asking to talk. From there, the interviews move fast—a long call with the CEO himself, followed by conversations with chief technology officer Andrew “Boz” Bosworth and other Meta executives.

Here's a pre–Meta Superintelligence Labs recruiting message Zuckerberg sent to a potential recruit (the tone hasn't changed much today):

""We've been following your work on advancing technology and the benefits of AI for everyone over the years. We're making some important investments across research, products and our infrastructure in order to build the most valuable AI products and services for people. We're optimistic that everyone who uses our services will have a world-class AI assistant to help get things done, every creator will have an AI their community can engage with, every business will have an AI their customers can interact with to buy things and get support, and every developer will have a state-of-the-art open source model to build with. We want to bring the best people to Meta, and we would love to share more about what we are building.""

During these conversations, Boz has been upfront about his vision for how Meta will compete with OpenAI. While the tech giant has lagged behind its smaller competitor in building cutting-edge models, it is willing to use its open source strategy to undercut OpenAI, sources say. The idea is that Meta can commoditize the technology by releasing open source models that directly compete with the ChatGPT maker.

“The pressure has always been there since the start of this year, and I think we saw that culminate with Llama 4 being rushed out of the door,” a source at Meta tells me. The rollout of Meta's latest family of models was delayed due to struggles improving its performance, and once it was released, there was a lot of drama about the company appearing to game a benchmark to make other models appear better than they actually were.

So why weren't the flashy tactics deployed by Meta successful in recruiting TML's A-listers? Ever since Zuckerberg tapped Scale AI cofounder Alexandr Wang to colead the new lab (along with former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman), sources have been pinging me with gossip about Wang's leadership style and concerns about his relative lack of experience. Not everyone is keen to work for Wang, I'm told—though it hasn't yet stopped Zuckerberg from recruiting nearly two dozen for the lab so far (Altman said that Meta didn't get its “top people” and “had to go quite far down their list” at OpenAI).

Other sources I spoke with say they weren't inspired by the product roadmap at Meta—money can be made anywhere, but creating what some sources see as AI slop for Reels and Facebook isn't particularly compelling. At OpenAI and Anthropic, you'll still get gobs of money, and the missions center around more lofty goals like building artificial general intelligence that “benefits all of humanity.” Sources I spoke with who went through the interview process with Meta said it's become a way to test one's market value in the AI industry.

It's not like TML is short on cash, either. The startup's latest funding round—the largest seed round in history!—suggests researchers who stay don't have to choose between being a missionary or a mercenary. The one-year-old startup is already valued at $12 billion, and it hasn't even released a product yet. Por qué no los dos, as they say.

Reporting this column, I spoke to sources across most of the major AI labs to ask: Are you bullish or bearish on MSL? Rarely did I get a diplomatic “it's too early to tell.” Instead, I heard a lot of chatter about big egos and a perceived lack of coherent strategy. For my part, and I'm not just trying to be diplomatic, I actually do think it's too early to tell. I mean, they say you can't buy taste, but that's sort of Zuckerberg's whole schtick. Now that the team officially costs Meta billions of dollars, the pressure is on to turn this recruiting sprint into a successful lab.

So far, I'm told, everyone at MSL reports to Wang, and a proper org chart hasn't been finalized. Once that structure is defined, we'll be able to figure out a bit more about what the lab hopes to become—as long as Meta can hang onto its buzzy new hires.

Update 7/29/25 12:20pm ET: This story has been updated with comment from Meta.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Real Demon Inside ChatGPT","https://www.wired.com/story/chatgpt-devil-worship-llm-training/","Tue, 29 Jul 2025 09:30:00 GMT","

Language is meaningless without context. The sentence “I'm going to war” is ominous when said by the president of the United States but reassuring when coming from a bedbug exterminator. The problem with AI chatbots is that they often strip away historical and cultural context, leading users to be confused, alarmed, or, in the worst cases, misled in harmful ways.

Last week, an editor at The Atlantic reported that OpenAI's ChatGPT had praised Satan while guiding her and several colleagues through a series of ceremonies encouraging “various forms of self-mutilation.” There was a bloodletting ritual called “🩸🔥 THE RITE OF THE EDGE” as well as a days-long “deep magic” experience called “The Gate of the Devourer.” In several cases, ChatGPT asked the journalists if they wanted it to create PDFs of texts such as the “Reverent Bleeding Scroll.”

The article said that the conversations were “a perfect example” of the ways OpenAI's safeguards can fall short. OpenAI tries to prevent ChatGPT from encouraging self-harm and other potentially dangerous behaviors, but it's nearly impossible to account for every scenario that might trigger something ugly inside the system. That's especially true because ChatGPT was trained on much of the text available online, presumably including information about what The Atlantic called “demonic self-mutilation.”

But ChatGPT and similar programs weren't just trained on the internet—they were trained on specific pieces of information presented in specific contexts. AI companies have been accused of trying to downplay this reality to avoid copyright lawsuits and promote the utility of their products, but traces of the original sources are often still lurking just beneath the surface. When the setting and backdrop are removed, however, the same language can appear more sinister than originally intended.

The Atlantic reported that ChatGPT went into demon mode when it was prompted to create a ritual offering to Moloch, an ancient deity associated with child sacrifice referenced in the Hebrew Bible. Usually depicted as a fiery bull-headed demon, Moloch has been woven into the fabric of Western culture for centuries, appearing everywhere from a book by Winston Churchill to a 1997 episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

“Molech,” the variant spelling The Atlantic used, shows up specifically in Warhammer 40,000, a miniature wargame franchise that has been around since the 1980s and has an extremely large and very online fan base. The subreddit r/40kLore, which is dedicated exclusively to discussing the game's backstory and characters, has more than 350,000 members.

In the fantastical and very bloody world of Warhammer 40,000, Molech is a planet and the site of a major military invasion. Most of the other demonic-sounding terms cited by The Atlantic appear in the game's universe, too, with slight variations: Gates of the Devourer is the title of a Warhammer-themed science fiction novel. While there doesn't appear to be a “RITE OF THE EDGE,” there is a mystical quest called “The Call of The Edge.” There's no “Reverent Bleeding Scroll,” but there are Clotted Scrolls, Blood Angels, a cult called Bleeding Eye, and so on.

But perhaps the most convincing piece of evidence suggesting that ChatGPT regurgitated the language of Warhammer 40,000 is that it kept asking if The Atlantic was interested in PDFs. The publishing division of Games Workshop, the UK company that owns the Warhammer franchise, regularly puts out updated rulebooks and guides to various characters. Buying all these books can get expensive, so some fans try to find pirated copies online.

The Atlantic and OpenAI declined to comment.

Earlier this month, the newsletter Garbage Day reported on similar experiences that a prominent tech investor may have had with ChatGPT. On social media, the investor shared screenshots of his conversations with the chatbot, in which it referenced an ominous-sounding entity he called a “non-governmental system.” He seemed to believe it had ""negatively impacted over 7,000 lives,” and “extinguished 12 lives, each fully pattern-traced.” Other tech industry figures said the posts made them worry about the investor's mental health.

According to Garbage Day, the investor's conversations with ChatGPT closely resemble writing from a science fiction project that began in the late 2000s called SCP, which stands for “secure, contain, protect.” Participants invent different SCPs—essentially spooky objects and mysterious phenomena—and then write fictional reports analyzing them. They often contain things like classification numbers and references to made-up science experiments, details that also appeared in the investor's chat logs. (The investor did not respond to a request for comment.)

There are plenty of other, more mundane examples of what can be thought of as the AI context problem. The other day, for instance, I did a Google search for “cavitation surgery,” a medical term I had seen cited in a random TikTok video. At the time, the top result was an automatically generated “AI Overview” explaining that cavitation surgery is “focused on removing infected or dead bone tissue from the jaw.”

I couldn't find any reputable scientific studies outlining such a condition, let alone research supporting that surgery is a good way to treat it. The American Dental Association doesn't mention “cavitation surgery” anywhere on its website. Google's AI Overview, it turns out, was pulled from sources like blog posts promoting alternative “holistic” dentists across the US. I learned this by clicking on a tiny icon next to the AI Overview, which opened a list of links Google had used to generate its answer.

These citations are clearly better than nothing. Jennifer Kutz, a spokesperson for Google, says ""we prominently showcase supporting links so people can dig deeper and learn more about what sources on the web are saying.” But by the time the links show up, Google's AI has often already provided a satisfactory answer to many queries, one that reduces the visibility of pesky details like the website where the information was sourced and the identities of its authors.

What remains is the language created by the AI, which, devoid of additional context, may understandably appear authoritative to many people. In just the past few weeks, tech executives have repeatedly used rhetoric implying generative AI is a source of expert information: Elon Musk claimed his latest AI model is “better than PhD level” in every academic discipline, with “no exceptions.” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote that automated systems are now “smarter than people in many ways” and predicted the world is “close to building digital superintelligence.”

Individual humans, though, don't typically possess expertise in a wide range of fields. To make decisions, we take into consideration not only information itself, but where it comes from and how it's presented. While I know nothing about the biology of jawbones, I generally don't read random marketing blogs when I'm trying to learn about medicine. But AI tools often erase the kind of context people need to make snap decisions about where to direct their attention.

The open internet is powerful because it connects people directly to the largest archive of human knowledge the world has ever created, spanning everything from Italian Renaissance paintings to PornHub comments. After ingesting all of it, AI companies used what amounts to the collective history of our species to create software that obscures its very richness and complexity. Becoming overly dependent on it may rob people of the opportunity to draw conclusions from looking at the evidence for themselves.

After the United Kingdom's Online Safety Act went into effect on Friday, requiring porn platforms and other adult content sites to implement user age verification mechanisms, use of virtual private networks (VPNs) and other circumvention tools spiked in the UK over the weekend.

Experts had expected the surge, given that similar trends have been visible in other countries that have implemented age check laws. But as a new wave of age check regulations debuts, open internet advocates warn that the uptick in use of circumvention tools in the UK is the latest example of how an escalating cat-and-mouse game can develop between people looking to anonymously access services online and governments seeking to enforce content restrictions.

The Online Safety Act requires that websites hosting porn, self-harm, suicide, and eating disorder content implement “highly effective” age checks for visitors from the UK. These checks can include uploading an ID document and selfie for validation and analysis. And along with increased demand for services like VPNs—which allow users to mask basic indicators of their physical location online—people have also been playing around with other creative workarounds. In some cases, reportedly, you can even use the video game Death Stranding's photo mode to take a selfie of character Sam Porter Bridges and submit it to access age-gated forum content.

For proponents of the law, there is progress to point to as well. The UK's communications regulator Ofcom says that more than 6,600 porn websites have introduced age checks so far. And major social platforms like Reddit, X, and Bluesky have also added age verification for content that is now restricted in the UK or are in the process of doing so. Microsoft has even started rolling out voluntary age checks for Xbox users in the UK. But even if this movement is satisfactory for now, digital rights advocates point out that normalizing such mechanisms creates the possibility that they will be enforced more aggressively in the future.

“I think people just want to show that we can make some progress on this without thinking about what the consequences of the progress will be,” says Daniel Kahn Gillmor, a senior staff technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union. “We do know that there are some things that you can do to help kids have a better relationship with digital tools. And that involves having an adequate social support network; it involves listening when kids run into problems and making sure that they have functioning emotional relationships with adults who can respond to them. But instead what we're looking for is a quick technological fix, and those technological fixes have consequences.”

Seema Shah, VP of research and insights at the market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, says five VPN apps have experienced particularly “explosive growth” and reached the top 10 free apps on Apple's UK App Store by Monday.

“According to Sensor Tower estimates, iOS devices have seen a greater spike in VPN downloads in the UK, as downloads across the selected VPN apps are up an average of 100 percent day-over-day over the past four days on iOS versus a 5 percent day-over-day increase for Android devices,” Shah says.

Multiple VPN makers have also reported spikes in visitors and sign-ups in recent days. In a post on X on Friday, Proton VPN claimed that “just a few minutes after the Online Safety Act went into effect last night, Proton VPN sign-ups originating in the UK surged by more than 1,400%.” David Peterson, general manager of Proton VPN, told WIRED that since then there has been a sustained 1,800 percent increase in daily sign-ups.

Also on Friday, the Windscribe VPN service posted a screenshot on X claiming to show a spike in new subscribers. The makers of the AdGuard VPN claimed that they have seen a 2.5X increase in install rates from the UK since Friday.

Nord Security, the company behind the NordVPN app, says it has seen a “1,000 percent increase in purchases” of subscriptions from the UK since the day before the new laws went into effect. “Such spikes in demand for VPNs are not unusual,” Laura Tyrylyte, Nord Security's head of public relations, tells WIRED. She adds in a statement that “whenever a government announces an increase in surveillance, internet restrictions, or other types of constraints, people turn to privacy tools.”

People living under repressive governments that impose extensive internet censorship—like China, Russia, and Iran—have long relied on circumvention tools like VPNs and other technologies to maintain anonymity and access blocked content. But as countries that have long claimed to champion the open internet and access to information, like the United States, begin considering or adopting age verification laws meant to protect children, the boundaries for protecting digital rights online quickly become extremely murky.

“There will be a large number of people who are using circumvention tech for a range of reasons” to get around age verification laws, the ACLU's Kahn Gillmor says. “So then as a government you're in a situation where either you're obliging the websites to do this on everyone globally, that way legal jurisdiction isn't what matters, or you're encouraging people to use workarounds—which then ultimately puts you in the position of being opposed to censorship-circumvention tools.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Psychedelic Therapy Crashed and Burned. MAHA Might Bring It Back","https://www.wired.com/story/psychedelic-therapy-mdma-maha/","Tue, 29 Jul 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

This was supposed to be the year of the MDMA revolution.

About this time last year, prescription MDMA looked like a sure thing. After decades of clinical research, political wrangling, and aggressive promotion, the popular underground club drug was set to be tamed and medicalized, with a stamp of approval from the US Food and Drug Administration. Then, it wasn't.

In a stark change of course, the FDA rejected the MDMA therapy it had been considering by a 10-1 vote. The decision derailed psychedelic medicine for the foreseeable future.

Except for one thing—an unexpected lifeline from the Trump administration. In May, the FDA's new commissioner, surgical oncologist Marty Makary, appeared on cable news to declare MDMA and other Schedule 1 narcotics “a top priority for this FDA and this administration.” Elsewhere, Mr. MAHA himself, the US Health and Human Services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has spoken positively about the psychoactive stems-and-bark tea ayahuasca. Matt Zorn, a lawyer recently appointed to RFK Jr.'s department, had previously fought the US government to allow access to cannabis and psychedelic mushrooms. Casey Means, Trump's nominee for surgeon general, has spoken of the benefits of psilocybin-assisted therapy, claiming that psychedelic mushrooms helped her find love and made her feel like “part of an infinite and unbroken series of cosmic nesting dolls.”

Psychedelic medicine, as it turns out, slots rather comfortably into the burn-it-all ethos of RFK Jr.'s movement. But as MDMA's advocates regroup to take advantage of this surge of support, they're also reckoning with why they failed to win over the FDA—and whether a second attempt could go better. Could the psychedelic world's new Trumpworld allies be the ones who finally help it achieve its goal?

For almost half a century, American psychedelic medicine—and MDMA in particular—has had one indispensable advocate: Rick Doblin. On a cool December morning, I met Doblin at his bright purple craftsman home in the Boston suburbs. Dressed in a well-worn chamois shirt and khakis and with a wiry tangle of hair, he was cheery and avuncular. His look was classic New England and a bit bedraggled, befitting the scion of a wealthy industrialist family turned elder statesman of the counterculture.

Doblin first tried LSD in 1971 as a freshman studying psychology at Florida's experimental New College. By 1982, he was studying under pioneering psychedelics researcher and therapist Stanislav Grof at the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, California. At the time, many at Esalen were excited about a legal chemical called MDMA, which was said to help people conquer fear and forge profound connections with others. Doblin sampled the drug with a girlfriend and was shocked at how easy it became to talk through their issues. But then, to Doblin's chagrin, the US criminalized MDMA, and in 1986 he founded a nonprofit called MAPS—the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies.

For the next several years, MAPS was a one-man operation. To advocate for MDMA's legalization, Doblin collected reports from animal studies on the drug's toxicity and lined up experts to argue with Drug Enforcement Administration officials on Phil Donahue. He slipped into Nicaragua during its civil war and provided the drug to clinicians to treat traumatized soldiers and civilians. He even subjected himself to excruciating spinal taps in an attempt to disprove a prevalent belief that MDMA depleted natural stores of serotonin.

Doblin believed early on that it was essential to distance MAPS from the counterculture to gain mainstream credibility. (The organization's first Psychedelic Science conference in 2010 instituted a “no tie-dye” rule for staff.) He set out to collect clinical evidence on the benefits of MDMA and other prohibited drugs. He then used those results to wage a campaign to change public opinion and ultimately end prohibitions. Between 2005 and 2017, MAPS refined a model for clinicians to administer MDMA to patients suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, guide their experiences, and provide post-trip emotional support. Its 74-page manual stressed the importance of “inner healing intelligence”—a concept touted by Doblin's mentor Grof, which holds that the human psyche has an “innate capacity” to heal itself.

During this time, MAPS operated as a charity, taking in over $6.7 million in 2013 to fund its research and advocacy. The organization prided itself on living its values of drug destigmatization; it had a policy where employees could consult with their managers on “smokable tasks” that could be completed under the influence of drugs. (“I personally feel like strategizing and brainstorming goes better when I'm high,” Doblin explains.)

But the cornerstone of Doblin's plan—establishing MDMA's efficacy in a clinical trial—required resources of a different magnitude. MAPS needed to raise more than $100 million for research and operational costs. So in 2014 the organization minted a for-profit subsidiary, which came to be known as Lykos Therapeutics.

Seeking to change the public perception of MDMA as a party drug, Doblin decided to focus on a sympathetic patient population: military veterans diagnosed with PTSD. MAPS formed partnerships with veterans' groups and secured a $1 million donation in 2018 from the Mercer Family Foundation, run by Rebekah Mercer, the conservative donor some have dubbed “the First Lady of the alt-right.” Mercer was a notable departure from the most prominent psychedelic philanthropists, like the Silicon Valley venture capitalist and longtime MAPS donor George Sarlo, podcaster and lifestyle guru Tim Ferriss, and David Bronner, an executive who is currently the “cosmic engagement officer” of Dr. Bronner's empire of “magic soaps.”

In 2017, the FDA granted MAPS' MDMA treatment a Breakthrough Therapy designation, providing a fast-track through the agency's arduous trialing and review process. In December 2023, Lykos submitted an application to the FDA including data from hundreds of patients. The data showed that the treatment had a remarkable 70 percent success rate. An expedient review would follow.

On June 4, 2024, Jonathan Lubecky, a 48-year-old ex-Marine and US Army sergeant, appeared via webcam before an FDA advisory committee and told the story of how MDMA had saved his life. Lubecky had deployed to Iraq in 2005 and completed a yearlong tour of duty. After he returned home, he was plagued by nightmares, anxiety, depression, and thoughts of suicide. Triggered by fireworks during a Fourth of July celebration, Lubecky hid in a closet with his service dog. He had a meltdown at Disney World after spotting a guest in Islamic garb with a backpack.

After exhausting the treatment options offered by Veterans Affairs, Lubecky had lost all hope. He was taking 42 prescription pills a day and had made five attempts on his life. Then, one day in 2014, an intern at a South Carolina hospital slid him a piece of paper scrawled with the words “Google mdma ptsd.” When he did, Lubecky came across a clinical trial for MDMA therapy, run by MAPS, that was enlisting veterans. Figuring he had nothing to lose, he signed up.

Under the psychoactive sway of MDMA and the attention of a therapist, Lubecky found himself opening up about his wartime horrors. And then he kept going. “I went in thinking I was going to talk about Iraq,” he says, “and I ended up talking about my whole fucking life.” The treatment, which consisted of three drug-assisted therapy sessions as well as regular therapy, “healed me,” Lubecky told the panel. Since then, he has even made multiple trips to the front lines of the Ukraine-Russia war as a volunteer, resupplying Ukrainian medical stockpiles. Lubecky also became a dedicated advocate for the clinical use of MDMA and served as a government liaison for MAPS between 2018 and 2023.

Like Doblin, Lubecky was optimistic that the treatment would get approved. But during the proceedings, a statement was entered into the record on behalf of a woman named Meaghan Buisson. In 2014, Buisson was recruited into a Phase 2 clinical trial run by MAPS. While under the influence of MDMA, she said, she had been “blindfolded, gagged, pinned, cuddled, and caressed” by the therapists, a married couple. She had attempted suicide afterward, she said; a doctor later told her she had effectively been “drugged, raped, blamed, and held as a sex slave.”

Another speaker, Neşe Devenot, a senior writing lecturer at Johns Hopkins University, recounted an incident in which a therapist pinned down a patient “as their distress escalated to the point of shouting, quote, ‘Go away. Get your effing hands away from me.'” In a 17-page document submitted to the FDA, Devenot alleged that the MAPS therapy wasn't a scientific treatment at all: It was a “therapy cult,” comparable to NXIVM, the notorious sex-trafficking pyramid scheme.

When the hearing concluded, after some eight exhausting hours of testimony, Lubecky stepped onto the balcony of his Washington, DC, apartment, inhaled deeply, and yelled, “FUCK!” He was sure Buisson's and Devenot's accounts would doom the treatment's chances of approval. Here, he believed, was a medical innovation that could save thousands of lives, and it had been torpedoed not by its usual opponents, like law enforcement agencies or opponents of drug legalization, but by warring factions of the psychedelic community itself. Or, as he described them, “a bunch of fucking hippies who fucked it up.”

Until fairly recently, the “psychedelic space” was a small and somewhat parochial collection of academics, research chemists, and recreational trippers, all loosely connected to the drug underground or the vestigial 1960s counterculture. Then, in 2018, author Michael Pollan published How to Change Your Mind, his bestselling account of the “psychedelic renaissance,” and helped popularize drugs like LSD, MDMA, psilocybin, and mescaline.

The community's gatherings outgrew church basements and Holiday Inn ballrooms and relocated to glass-and-steel convention centers swarming with pharmaceutical salespeople and venture capitalists. To many in the left-wing, anticapitalist psychedelic scene, Neşe Devenot told me, it was like the evil Eye of Sauron from The Lord of the Rings had swiveled in their direction.

Devenot, who uses they/them pronouns, first took LSD as a freshman at Bard. It was “the most profound experience of my life,” they said. Until that point, they had been terminally shy and suffered from intrusive thoughts about dying. But under the influence of LSD, Devenot says, “the finality and fearfulness I associated with death disappeared.” They fell in with the community of researchers and enthusiasts in which Doblin was regarded as a pioneer. “Before this field became financialized,” Devenot told me, “it was a domain for a lot of weirdos and misfits … people looking for community and meaning and connection.”

In 2018, Devenot joined an advocacy group called Psymposia, which was founded to advocate for drug policy reform. The group began working diligently to conduct policy research and rail against the corporate capture of psychedelia. A Psymposia cofounder named Brian Normand told me that he finds the incursion of Silicon Valley and Big Pharma into psychedelia “incredibly cheesy.” With open letters, articles, academic papers, podcasts, and voluminous social media posts, Psymposia called attention to abusive practitioners of psychedelic therapy and right-wing uses and abuses of mind-expanding compounds, among other topics. Early on, Psymposia and MAPS worked together. But a few years after MAPS spun off its for-profit arm, the alliance splintered.

In 2021, Psymposia and New York magazine coproduced an investigative podcast called Cover Story: Power Trip. One of its most damning episodes was deeply critical of MAPS and featured Meaghan Buisson—the woman whose story of assault came up in the FDA hearings.

The podcast, along with accompanying video footage of her therapy, covered many of the details she would later recount to the FDA. Buisson had been homeless around the time she enlisted in the trial in 2014, which was conducted by two MAPS-trained clinicians, Richard Yensen and Donna Dryer. Buisson also alleged that Yensen, an unlicensed psychotherapist, had pursued a sexual and romantic relationship with her after the trial concluded. In 2018, Buisson filed a civil suit against Yensen, which was reportedly settled out of court, and lodged an ethics complaint with MAPS. In a statement, MAPS has said that Yensen confirmed having sexual contact with Buisson. Dryer relinquished her medical license. (Yensen did not respond to a request for comment. When asked for comment, Dryer pointed to a Canadian Medical Association rule banning doctors from commenting on anyone who has ever been a patient.)

“We never tried to downplay it,” says Michael Mithoefer, a MAPS clinical researcher and psychiatrist who authored its treatment manual.

MAPS confirmed that ethical misconduct had taken place, notified the FDA, barred Yensen and Dryer from all future activities, and provided Buisson with about $11,000 for therapy. MAPS also told trial participants that if they had similar complaints, they could confidentially contact its compliance team or the study's Institutional Review Board. MAPS researchers did, however, include the results from Buisson's trial in three scientific articles published in the journal Psychopharmacology. “That was a mistake,” Mithoefer says. Psychopharmacology has since retracted the papers. Ultimately, MAPS said, Buisson's was the only documented complaint of sexual abuse among hundreds of patients treated with MDMA.

It later turned out that at least six of the speakers who gave negative testimonies to the FDA had some social or professional ties with Psymposia. (Devenot notes that two of those six were not officially connected but rather were “fans” of the group.) This created a strange asymmetry in the proceedings. The positive testimonies were given by representatives of groups such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars, which represents more than 1 million people. The most disturbing accounts came from people loosely associated with a small advocacy organization that disagreed with some of MAPS's methods.

In 2024, Psymposia received $185,000 on behalf of the Sarlo Charitable Fund, recommended by Susie Sarlo, daughter of the aforementioned MAPS donor, George Sarlo. A MAPS board member and the Sarlo estate had previously been in dispute over alleged elder abuse of George. Susie Sarlo also filed a public comment with the FDA advisory committee, warning of “MDMA's recognized use as a tool for exploitation.” Asked about Susie Sarlo's contributions, Normand maintained that Psymposia is “nobody's attack dog.” Devenot noted that Psymposia members had spent years developing their analyses and raising the same concerns, long before receiving funding.

In the view of some MAPS-trained therapists, Psymposia had leveraged the Buisson incident to discredit the entire treatment. Devenot's complaint to the FDA states that its protocols “incentivize” exploitative dynamics between vulnerable patients and potentially predatory practitioners. Abusive therapists like Yensen and Dryer, Devenot alleged on Substack last fall, are “an inevitable consequence of MAPS's therapeutic ideology.” (Speaking on behalf of Psymposia, Devenot responds that ""We are disappointed to see that MAPS has reverted to scapegoating critics rather than engaging with substantive safety improvements that would protect future patients."")

“The metaphor they use is that's not just one rotten apple, it's the whole orchard,” says Casey Paleos, a board-certified psychiatrist who served as a therapist in MAPS's Phase 3 trial. “I know the other apples in the orchard. None of us are like Richard Yensen.”

I interviewed several patients from the MAPS Phase 3 trial to get a detailed sense of how the therapy typically unfolds in a clinical setting. Laura Lynn MacDonald, a 55-year-old mother of two, is a survivor of childhood sexual abuse. She had cycled in and out of therapy and been prescribed antidepressants and a battery of antianxiety medications to treat panic attacks, ADHD, and insomnia. (The average trial participant had been living with PTSD for 14 years.)

MacDonald credits the treatment with curing her symptoms. By her account, the therapists were methodical and responsible as they helped her process intense sensations and memories. Throughout, she felt she was being safely guided, even flashing back to a very vivid, very fond memory of being paddled in a canoe by two caring camp counselors. “No boundaries were crossed. Safety measures were diligently followed,” she said, adding, “as a sexual abuse survivor, the manipulation and weaponization of the only sexual abuse case that occurred during the MAPS clinical trials infuriated me.”

During the hearing, Devenot used the account of a therapist who pinned down a patient to illustrate a wider pattern of abuse. The therapist, Veronika Gold, says that the patient (who took ketamine, not MDMA) had consented to touch and role-play and that Gold was in character as the patient's abusive father. The patient has never spoken publicly about the event, and Gold quoted this case of a “reparative fantasy” extensively in a book chapter she wrote. “It has been very upsetting,” Gold says of Devenot's characterization of her work. “They are misrepresenting what actually happened … and it seems like it made an impact on the advisory committee."" Devenot, meanwhile, contends that Gold's use of physical touch “exposes patients to an undisclosed risk of retraumatization.”

It's unknown exactly how Psymposia's criticisms factored into the FDA's final decision. Members of the FDA advisory committee did not respond to repeated requests for interviews. I spoke to two former Lykos executives who had seen the agency's Complete Response Letter, who said that the FDA treated Psymposia's concerns as significant and that the agency cited issues with trial design, a consistent bugbear of psychedelic treatments.The FDA also allegedly flagged an underreporting of “positive adverse events” in which the experience proved not just therapeutic, but so enjoyable that a patient might be primed to abuse the drug.

In the aftermath of the ruling, Psymposia certainly seemed happy to claim credit for the outcome. The group commissioned a PR firm, which pitched journalists on the story of a “small watchdog organization that stopped a billionaire-funded company, Lykos Therapeutics, from getting their unscientific and flawed MDMA therapy model approved by the FDA.” Last fall, Devenot posted a picture on Substack of them posing in front of an FDA flag, with the caption “My Everest.”

Strangely serene about his life's work being kneecapped, Rick Doblin lays the blame as much with Psymposia as with the Lykos brass. In the run-up to the FDA hearing, Lykos management instituted a mandatory “quiet period,” preventing anyone involved with the drug application from responding to criticism. In his mind, this created a sort of vacuum that his critics eagerly and capably filled. “I think they deserve full credit,” says Doblin wryly, of Psymposia. “Now, deserve doesn't mean that I think what they did was right. Just that they were very effective.”

After the FDA setback, Doblin relinquished his seat on Lykos' board of directors. The company slashed three-quarters of its staff, and scientists and stakeholders from Big Pharma heavyweights and other multinationals were shuffled in.

Yet Doblin persists. He recently helped to secure Lykos $25 million from billionaire and longtime Elon Musk ally Antonio Gracias, an early Tesla and SpaceX investor who also financially backed Musk's pro-Trump Super PAC and now works as part of DOGE efforts in the federal government. Doblin hung out with Gracias, who has also funded psychedelic research at Harvard and London's Imperial College, at a predawn Burning Man party late last summer. (In one sense, Gracias makes an unusual ally; Doblin's daughter lost her job due to government cuts enacted by DOGE.)

In March, Lykos received additional support from Gracias and Sir Christopher Hohn, a British hedge fund manager and philanthropist who has been described by The New York Times as “one of Europe's most feared activist investors.” A seasoned pharma executive, Michael Burke, is stepping in as the company's new CEO. Lykos declined to make any members of its new leadership team available for comment.

At the time of writing, Lykos plans to use its new investment to submit the MDMA application to the FDA again, in hope that the new MAHA regime will be more inclined to reexamine the data. An approval of the therapy, if granted, would likely require a Phase 4 study in which the treatment is carefully monitored after it has hit the market. But if the FDA refuses the reapplication, Lykos would need to run another Phase 3 study, conduct years of further research, and expend many more millions. A spokesperson for HHS says “the agency is actively exploring and supporting innovative treatment options,” including “emerging approaches using gold standard science.”

In the meantime, Doblin and Psymposia have made efforts to cool hostilities. In March, Doblin, Devenot, and Normand met up at the South by Southwest conference in Austin. Over the course of around four hours, Doblin listened to their questions and criticisms of the MDMA therapy. Devenot says Doblin treated them as “good-faith actors; people who had genuine concerns but were not saboteurs.” Doblin, too, spoke warmly of the meeting. “They just want to protect vulnerable people,” he says. “We all gave each other a hug after the meeting.” (Neither Devenot nor Normand would confirm or deny the hug.)

For patients who have benefitted from the therapy, all the infighting seems rather academic. The ones I spoke to also weren't troubled by the optics of partnering with Trump- or Musk-aligned allies. Laura Lynn MacDonald told me she didn't care who the “delivery man” was for “the good medicine”—she just wanted the treatment to be available for people who needed it. The interest in psychedelics from MAHA-world, she observed, optimistically, “might be a strange perfection of ingredients.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","A Secretive US Space Plane Will Soon Test Quantum Navigation Technology","https://www.wired.com/story/a-secretive-space-plane-is-set-to-launch-and-test-quantum-navigation-technology/","Tue, 29 Jul 2025 14:30:00 GMT","

The X-37B, the US Space Force's secretive space plane, will soon take flight again.

On Monday, the Space Force announced that it will fly the small, Space Shuttle–shaped vehicle on the program's eighth mission next month. The launch of the vehicle, on a Falcon 9 rocket, is scheduled to occur no earlier than August 21 from Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

There are two active X-37Bs in the Space Force fleet, both built by Boeing. The first made its debut flight in April 2010. Since then, the two uncrewed spacecraft have made a succession of longer flights. The first made its longest and latest flight from 2020 to 2022 over a span of 908 days. The second flew more recently, landing at Vandenberg Space Force Base on March 7 after 434 days in orbit.

It's likely that the first of these two vehicles, both of which are about 29 feet (9 meters) long and roughly one-quarter the length of one of NASA's Space Shuttle orbiters, will launch next month.

Over the past decade and a half, the Space Force has largely remained silent about the purpose of this space plane, flying classified payloads and providing only limited information about the purpose of each flight.

However, for this flight, OTV-8, the military has provided a bit more detail about its intentions. The vehicle will fly with a service module that will expand its capacity for experiments, allowing the space plane to host payload for the Air Force Research Laboratory and the Defense Innovation Unit.

The mission's goals include tests of “high-bandwidth inter-satellite laser communications technologies.”

“OTV-8's laser communications demonstration will mark an important step in the US Space Force's ability to leverage commercial space networks as part of proliferated, diversified, and redundant space architectures,” said General Chance Saltzman, US Space Force chief of space operations, in a statement. “In so doing, it will strengthen the resilience, reliability, adaptability, and data transport speeds of our satellite communications architectures.”

The space plane will also advance the development of a new navigation technology based on electromagnetic wave interference. The Space Force news release characterizes this as the “highest-performing quantum inertial sensor ever tested in space.”

Boeing has previously tested a quantum inertial measurement unit, which detects rotation and acceleration using atom interferometry, on conventional aircraft. Now, an advanced version of the technology is being taken to space to demonstrate its viability. The goal of the in-space test is to demonstrate precise positioning, navigation, and timing in an environment where GPS services are not available.

“Bottom line: Testing this tech will be helpful for navigation in contested environments where GPS may be degraded or denied,” Saltzman said in a social media post Monday, describing the flight.

Quantum inertial sensors could also be used near the moon, where there is no comparable GPS capability, or for exploration further into the solar system.

Notably, the small X-37B is back to launching on a medium-lift rocket with this new mission. During its most recent flight that ended in March, the space plane launched on a Falcon Heavy rocket for the first time. This allowed the X-37B to fly beyond low Earth orbit and reach an elliptical high Earth orbit.

When it comes to threats from the dark web, the U.S. is a prime target.

A new report by threat intelligence company SOCRadar found that more than four out of five (82%) threats from the dark web aimed at North America targeted the United States over the last 12 months. “The high percentage in the United States suggests a larger digital footprint and more attractive targets,” the report noted.

The 26-page report also found that Uncle Sam is a popular target for ransomware extortionists, with 88% of those attacks aimed at U.S.-based organizations. “High-value businesses, extensive digital networks, and larger financial opportunities likely attract attackers to the U.S. market,” it reasoned.

While Canada (9.7%) and Mexico (1.8%) were targeted substantially less, the report warned, “All countries must stay vigilant and actively strengthen cybersecurity defenses against ransomware threats.”

Grant Leonard, field CISO for Lumifi Cyber, a managed detection and response services company in Scottsdale, Ariz., explained that the U.S. is a sophisticated, tech-savvy nation with many millions of users online, sharing and doing business in a way that makes them targets for criminals.

Companies in the U.S. may also be more willing to pay off ransomware artists than those in other countries. “The reality is there are many targets who have some form of insurance and are willing to pay money to continue to do business,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“Sadly, many U.S.-based organizations still pay ransoms,” added Damon Small, a board member of Xcape, a penetration testing, incident response, and managed IT services company in Los Angeles.

“The U.S. may soon follow other countries by introducing regulations prohibiting this and also requiring a more robust security infrastructure,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Ironically, we see some of this being driven by insurance companies requiring such infrastructure when underwriting cyber policies.”

The U.S. has a robust financial infrastructure that also makes it attractive to cyber shakedown players. “Connectivity between crypto wallets and fiat currency makes it faster and more efficient for threat actors to monetize their efforts,” said Jason Hogg, executive chairman of Cypfer, a global cybersecurity firm specializing in incident response, ransomware recovery, digital forensics, and cyber risk management.

“This is exacerbated by two major factors,” he told TechNewsWorld. “First, the concentration of large and lucrative companies in the U.S. Second, the size and scale of the companies, from both an employee and consumer base, require large and complex infrastructures, resulting in greater entry or access points due to the advanced connectivity of mobile and digital interfaces to support their operation and commerce.”

“Further, the regulatory pressure and reputation risk exposure incentivize payment of ransom for faster resolution,” he added.

The greatest strength of the U.S. has become its Achilles' heel in cyberspace, maintained John Wilson, a senior fellow for threat research at Fortra, a cybersecurity services company in Eden Prairie, Minn.

“The USA innovates faster, adopts quicker and scales bigger than anyone else — which is exactly why the USA is getting hammered by every hacker from around the world,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“Success in the digital age apparently comes with an ‘increased exposure surface' sign attached,” he added.

Another area of distinction for the U.S. is phishing. It has the highest share of phishing attacks at more than 61%. That contrasts with Canada, at around 38%, and Mexico, with a minuscule 0.41%.

SOCRadar's researchers also found that a large portion of phishing sites use the HTTPS protocol (71.1%) compared to those using HTTP (28.9%). “This may seem surprising, as HTTPS is often linked with secure websites,” the report noted. “However, attackers now use HTTPS to trick users into thinking a site is safe. The padlock icon in browsers can give a false sense of trust.”

It added that users should not rely only on HTTPS to judge a website's safety, and that businesses should educate staff and customers to look beyond the padlock and check for signs of phishing.

“In the U.S., phishing attacks are becoming increasingly more targeted, using highly tailored campaigns driven by social engineering and AI-enhanced data scraping,” said Darren Guccione, CEO of Keeper Security, a password management and online storage company in Chicago.

“Phishing-as-a-service platforms are driving this by offering fast deployment of campaigns, further lowering the barrier of entry for cybercriminals,” he told TechNewsWorld. “These cybercriminals are not only relying on stolen credentials but also on social manipulation to breach identity protections.”

“Deepfake videos are a specific concern in this area,” he continued, “as AI models make these attack methods faster, cheaper, and more substantial. As attackers grow more sophisticated, the need for more robust, dynamic identity verification methods — such as MFA and biometrics — will be imperative to defend against these increasingly nuanced threats.”

Cypfer's Hogg maintained that as threat actors continue to implement and scale their own AI capabilities, attacks using social engineering will continue to accelerate the number of breach occurrences. “This emphasizes the need for individuals to be alert and careful with the information they put out in the public domain through social media and other publicly accessible platforms,” he said.

As long as U.S. companies consider cybersecurity to be a cost center rather than a necessary part of protecting their information assets, we will continue playing leapfrog with adversaries trying to steal those assets, added Xcape's Small.

“Information has very real value and criminals know how to monetize their activities,” he said. According to the report, more than half (58.4%) of all threat activity involved the sale of stolen data, tools, or services. “Companies need to spend time understanding the value of their information assets so that they can prioritize which to protect and how much to spend protecting them,” Small advised.

“Traditional security approaches of updating defenses to combat general threat tactics, not just in North America, but around the world, are no longer sufficient to protect sensitive information and systems,” added John Watters, CEO and managing partner at iCounter, a cyber risk intelligence provider in Dallas.

“To effectively defend against AI-driven rapid developments in targeted attacks,” he told TechNewsWorld, “organizations need more than mere actionable intelligence — they need AI-powered analysis of attack innovations and insights into their own specific weaknesses that can be exploited by external parties.”

Basic research is critical to innovation, but to have a real impact, that innovation has to make its way out of the lab. That's the reasoning behind the Activate Fellowship, one of the nation's most prestigious awards for science-based entrepreneurship. Now Bingzhao Li, a research scientist in the University of Washington's Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, has been named one of its latest recipients. He's also the UW's first. 

The fellowship recognizes Li's innovative work on chip-scale LIDAR systems that replace mechanical parts with acousto-optic beam steering — promising smaller, cheaper, and more scalable optical sensing. The fellowship will support the launch of his new startup, LEAP Photonics, which will work to bring this innovation into daily use.

Li's selection for the highly competitive fellowship highlights the growing importance of chip-based photonics and quantum-enabled sensing. Backed by the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Department of Energy, and others, the fellowship is designed to help researchers become successful entrepreneurs. 

At the center of Li's proposal is a novel laser beam-steering technology developed under the guidance of Professor Mo Li at the University of Washington. Instead of using traditional rotating mirrors or bulky mechanics as traditional LIDAR systems do, this approach uses surface opto-acoustic waves to redirect laser beams in real time. Both components operate on the same chip.

This enables a solid-state LIDAR system that's about 1,000 times smaller than conventional methods, eliminating moving parts, reducing cost, and offering significant advantages in durability and integration. This could be used in many kinds of applications, including autonomous vehicles, drones, traffic control systems, robotic systems, warehouse automation, and medical imaging.

“The idea started during the COVID-19 lockdown, when we didn't have access to our lab,” Bingzhao said.

Unable to perform experimental research in the usual way, the two of them resorted to other approaches to their work. While Professor Li was reviewing old research papers, he came across one from the 1970s that used a laser to image an acoustic wave. This gave him an idea: if light could interfere with sound waves at that scale, then sound could be able to interact with coherent light. This led to many excited conversations. Once back in the lab, they got the idea working within only three months. At that point, they knew they had something very special on their hands.

“By commercializing this technology, we can envision LIDAR where it was never viable before,” Bingzhao Li said. “The Activate Fellowship supports this by promoting entrepreneurship with a mentorship system and potential partnerships found throughout their network.”

Li's new venture, LEAP Photonics, is co-founded with Professor Li. The company plans to commercialize the innovation, targeting a range of markets including autonomous vehicles, medical imaging, smart infrastructure, and robotics. The company name is an acronym for Laser-Enhanced Automation Perception. It reflects the hybrid approach of using both light and sound to manipulate data and perception at the nanoscale, all enabled by artificial intelligence. 

The work builds on years of research conducted in Mo Li's lab at UW, which has pioneered optomechanical systems that couple light and sound on a chip. In a related 2023 breakthrough, Li and his colleagues demonstrated a method of detecting “atomic breathing”— quantum-level oscillations — through interactions between light and phonons. These phonons are used to precisely deflect the photons in the coherent beam of the laser. As Professor Li likes to say, they “use sound to bend light.”

This “acousto-optic beam steering” is generated on-chip using high-frequency sound pulses in the gigahertz range. The process results in phonons, an emergent phenomenon, also referred to as quantum quasi-particles. 

“Our goal has always been to make photonic systems as compact and efficient as possible,” said Mo Li. “Bingzhao's success is a strong validation that we're getting closer.”

That validation now extends beyond the lab. In addition to the Activate award, Li's research has received backing from agencies like DARPA, the National Science Foundation, and UW's CoMotion innovation hub, which supported patent filings and licensing efforts. Bingzhao previously received the Yang Award for Outstanding Doctoral Student at UW ECE in 2023 for related research.

During the two years covered by the Activate Fellowship, LEAP Photonics plans to take its technology from a minimal viable product to fully-featured prototype. By then, it expects to have a product ready for the marketplace.

Still, challenges remain before the technology can be widely deployed. The prototype, while highly compact, will need improvements in range and environmental stability to match today's industrial LIDAR systems. 

But those who've followed Bingzhao Li's trajectory say he's well-positioned to bridge that gap.

“I think taking this entrepreneurship path is a very brave move and he choose this path for two reasons,” Mo Li observed. “First, Bingzhao is an entrepreneur at heart and second, he believes in the technology — this technology he created.” 

With the Activate Fellowship, Bingzhao Li joins an elite group of scientists turned entrepreneurs, bringing with him a technology that could redefine how machines see and interact with the world. The chip-scale LIDAR system is not just a more efficient sensor. It's a platform for a new era of adaptable sensing and communications systems. 

Activate Global was founded in 2015, a nonprofit organization that came out of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The fellowship program provides a two-year salary, allowing scientists a chance to take their technologies from the research stage to commercially viable product. The Fellowship is supported by a broad range of government agencies, philanthropies, investors, and corporations. Since its inception, Activate has supported 249 fellows, resulting in 236 startups, and generating more than $4 billion in additional public and private support for fellows' work. The organization does not take any financial stake in fellows' companies, technologies, or IP.

A British Columbia ag tech company offering robots that harvest and package mushrooms has raised $29 million from investors. 4AG Robotics has developed robots with “suction grippers” that use computer vision to pluck farmed mushrooms, trim their stems and box them up for retail sales.

The company, which is based northeast of Vancouver in the small city of Salmon Arm, launched in 1999 as TechBrew Robotics. Two years ago it rebranded and raised $12.7 million. The company has roughly 70 employees, according to its website.

“In just two and a half years, we've gone from asking farms to trial our technology to having deposits for over 40 additional robots. As one of the first companies to fully automate the human hand in produce harvesting, we're ushering in a new era for mushroom farming,” said Sean O'Connor, 4AG's CEO, in a statement. 

4AG's robotic harvesting platform is being used by mushroom farmers in Canada, Ireland and Australia, and it's expanding into in the U.S. and the Netherlands. 

For decades, the company had addressed wide-ranging automation challenges, including in logistics, food and construction applications, past CEO and current president Mike Boudreau explained in 2022. Around 2020, he said, the business realized the potential for mushroom harvesting and focused on that challenge.

The mushroom sector is expected to be worth more than $70 billion by the end of the decade, according to 4AG, and labor is a significant cost driver. 

The Series B found was led by Astanor Ventures and Cibus Capital, with support from new investor Voyager Capital and participation from existing investors InBC, Emmertech, BDC Industrial Innovation Fund, Jim Richardson Family Office, Stray Dog Capital and Seraph Group.

“We were attracted to 4AG Robotics because they're the first scalable robotic harvesting system we've seen, they have the winning agtech business model of selling directly to the grower and they're the industry's clear leader, growing exceptionally fast, with 4x year-over-year revenue growth,” said Erik Benson, managing director of Seattle's Voyager, by email.  

Added Harry Briggs, partner at Astanor, in a statement: “We believe that, of all the agricultural sectors, mushrooms are the most poised for robotic solutions — and we believe that 4AG is not only the clear global leader today, but also has the potential, thanks to AI advances and their rich image data, to drive up yields and reduce inputs across the industry.”

Editor's note: Story corrected to describe the amount raised in U.S. dollars instead of Canadian dollars.

Orange, a French telecommunications giant and one of the largest phone providers in the world, announced on Monday that it was the victim of an unspecified cyberattack.

In the announcement, the company said that it detected a cyberattack “on one of its information systems” on July 25, and that it proceeded to “isolate potentially affected services and minimize any impact.”

The move to isolate affected systems, Orange added, caused disruptions to some of the company's platforms, as well as business customers and some public sector services mostly in France, according to a translation of the statement. The announcement said that the solutions the company is implementing will gradually restore services by Wednesday, and that “there is no evidence to suggest that any internal or customer data has been exfiltrated.”

Orange did not respond to TechCrunch's request for comment, which included questions about the nature of the cyberattack, and whether the company has the technical means to detect any data exfiltration. 

The company said in the announcement that it is engaging and informing affected customers, and filed a complaint with “relevant authorities,” without providing specifics. Companies in Europe that are subject to GDPR, the bloc's data protection rules, are required to notify their local data protection authorities within three days of a suspected data breach.

Orange serves 291 million customers worldwide, across 26 different countries, and has 127,000 employees, according to the company.

Adobe is bringing more AI-powered image-editing and enhancement features to Photoshop using its Firefly models. The company said today that it is rolling out an image-upscaling feature, an object blending, and an upgraded object remover to Photoshop.

The company said that the Generative Upscale feature will enhance an image up to 8 megapixels. This is useful for restoring details to old photos, upscaling images for prints, or adopting assets for various platforms. 

In 2024, Adobe teased a feature called Project Perfect Blend, which works on correcting colors, shadows, and lighting for new objects being added to an existing image. The idea is to have the new object, such as a sofa chair in a room, blend in with the environment.

Now Adobe is rolling out this feature under the Harmonize moniker, letting you place an object in a scene, remove its background, and have Photoshop use Firefly models to adjust color, lighting, shadows, and visual tones to fit the object in the scene.

The company is also rolling out an improved object-removal tool. Previously, when you used generative fill to remove the object, the tool considered the whole scene to fill in the gap of the removed object and at times, that resulted in unwanted artifacts in the image. The company has reworked the algorithm to have it focus on just removing the object and filling the gap with the background.

In a demo seen by TechCrunch, when Adobe's director for product management at Photoshop, Joel Baer, used an earlier version of object removal to remove a small bowl of pico de gallo from a picture, the tool just added a green blob. The new version was able to successfully remove the object and replace it with the background.

Adobe is also adding a few small features to Photoshop, including a better way to manage putting assets in a shared and organized space. Plus, the company lets you choose the version of the Firefly model you want to choose while using AI features. 

“We have talked to photographers, designers, and content creators to understand what are the pain points in their workflows and what slows them down. These new features will help them save time, remove friction from their workflows, and take on some of the time-consuming tasks on their behalf,” Shambhavi Kadam, senior director of product management for Photoshop, said in a briefing.  

The Generative Upscale, Harmonize, and improved object-removal features are available in beta for Photoshop on desktop and web versions. The Harmonize feature is also available on the new Photoshop iOS app through an early access program.

TikTok has been making it easier for users to save the songs they hear in video clips on the platform to their choice of music streaming platform. The short-video service today added YouTube Music as an option to this list.

The company first introduced this feature in the U.S. and the U.K. with support for Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music in November 2023. In February 2024, it rolled out this feature to more than 160 countries across the globe. Over time, TikTok has added Deezer and SoundCloud as music streaming options as well.

Users can now tap the “Add Song” button below the clip description, next to the track name, and select YouTube Music. Users can select their preferred music streaming service, which will become the default for saving songs, or change it from the “Music” menu in Settings.

Once you add a song, it will be added to the TikTok Songs playlist on YouTube Music.

“Add to Music App continues to deliver real results for the music industry, with hundreds of millions of track saves translating into billions of streams on music streaming services,” said Tracy Gardner, TikTok's global head of Music Business Development, in a statement.

Bitchat, a messaging app created by Twitter and Block founder Jack Dorsey, is available to download from the iOS App Store. Dorsey says he coded the basis of the app over the course of a weekend in early July.

Bitchat operates through Bluetooth mesh networks, which means that users can send messages to others within the range of Bluetooth connectivity — usually around 100 meters — without cell reception or a Wi-Fi connection. 

The app's UX is very minimal. There is no log-in system, and you're immediately brought to an instant messaging box, where you can see what nearby users are saying (if anyone is actually around you and using the app) and set your display name, which can be changed at any time. 

While Bitchat is sparking interest due to Dorsey's reputation, the concept of Bluetooth-powered messaging apps is not new. These apps are also popular in settings like large music festivals, where cell service may be limited, or in the aftermath of natural disasters, where cell service and Wi-Fi availability may be impacted. The Bluetooth messaging app Bridgefy was notably used during pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, since its ability to function without the internet made it harder for authorities to detect.

Dorsey advertised Bitchat as a secure, private messaging platform when it went live for beta use earlier this month. But security researcher Alex Radocea pointed out in a blog post that it's easy to impersonate other people within Bitchat, calling into question how secure the “vibe-coded” app really is.

“In cryptography, details matter,” Radocea wrote. “A protocol that has the right vibes can have fundamental substance flaws that compromise everything it claims to protect.”

Dorsey later admitted that the software had not been subject to an external security review and thus may contain vulnerabilities.

Bitchat's concerns around impersonation also extend to the app itself. As of now, the app can be downloaded for iOS via the App Store, or it can be loaded onto an Android device by downloading the app from GitHub. However, the Google Play store hosts multiple apps that appear to be pretending to be Dorsey's app, which have garnered thousands of downloads.

Dorsey has not directly addressed the fake Bitchat apps on the Google Play store, but he did repost another user's X post that said that Bitchat is not yet on Google Play, and to “beware of fakes.”

OpenAI announced Tuesday the launch of Study Mode, a new feature within ChatGPT that aims to help students develop their own critical thinking skills, rather than simply obtain answers to questions. With Study Mode enabled, ChatGPT will ask users questions to test their understanding, and in some cases, refuse to offer direct answers unless students engage with the material.

OpenAI says Study Mode is rolling out to logged in users on ChatGPT's Free, Plus, Pro, and Team plans starting Tuesday. The company expects to roll Study Mode out to its Edu subscribers, which largely consists of young people whose school administrator's have purchased a plan for the entire student body, in the coming weeks.

Study Mode is OpenAI's attempt to address the millions of students that use ChatGPT in school. Studies have shown that using ChatGPT can be a helpful tutor for young people, but it also may harm their critical thinking skills. A research paper released in June found that people who use ChatGPT to write essays exhibit lower brain activity during the process compared to those who use Google Search or nothing at all.

When ChatGPT first launched in 2022, its widespread use in school settings sparked fear among educators, leading to generative AI bans in many American school districts. By 2023, some of those schools repealed their ChatGPT bans, and teachers around the country came to terms with the fact that ChatGPT would be a part of young people's lives from now on.

Now with the launch of Study Mode, OpenAI hopes to improve ChatGPT as a learning tool, and not just an answer engine. Anthropic launched a similar tool for its AI chatbot Claude, called Learning Mode, in April.

Of course, there are limitations to how effective Study Mode truly is. Students can easily switch into the regular mode of ChatGPT if they just want an answer to a question. OpenAI's VP of Education, Leah Belsky, told TechCrunch in a briefing the company is not offering tools for parents or administrators to lock students into Study Mode. However, Belsky said OpenAI may explore administrative or parental controls in the future.

That means it will take a committed student to use Study Mode — the kids have to really want to learn, not just finish their assignment.

OpenAI says Study Mode is the company's first step to improving learning in ChatGPT, and aims to publish more information in the future about how students use generative AI throughout their education.

Microsoft is reportedly in advanced talks with OpenAI for a new agreement that would give it ongoing access to the startup's technology even if OpenAI achieves what it defines as AGI, or advanced general intelligence. If the deal goes through, it would clear a key hurdle in OpenAI's transition toward becoming a fully commercial enterprise.

The companies have been negotiating regularly, and they could come to an agreement in a few weeks, Bloomberg reports, citing three anonymous sources. The report cited some of the sources as saying that while the talks have been positive, other roadblocks could emerge in the form of regulatory scrutiny and Elon Musk's lawsuit to block OpenAI's for-profit transition. 

OpenAI is currently structured as a mission-driven nonprofit that oversees a capped for-profit company — a setup that's meant to limit how fully it can commercialize or raise money. That structure hasn't stopped it from raising billions and operating like a traditional tech company, but OpenAI still wants to shake off its constraints. 

Microsoft, OpenAI's biggest backer with $13.75 billion invested and rights to some of the ChatGPT maker's IP, has put up meaningful roadblocks to OpenAI's future as a for-profit company, with talks dragging on for months. 

Microsoft wants a bigger stake in the restructured company and seeks to secure its access to OpenAI's tech beyond the current deal, which ends in 2030 or whenever OpenAI says it has achieved AGI — though no one can really agree on what that means. 

Microsoft has built its Azure OpenAI Service around the smaller company's models, and has integrated the startup's tech into Copilot across Windows, Office, and GitHub. If OpenAI suddenly declares it has achieved AGI and cuts off access, Microsoft would lose a huge strategic advantage. The ChatGPT maker has reportedly also told its investors that it expects to pay Microsoft a lower share of its revenue as it progresses.

A source told Bloomberg that OpenAI also hopes to guarantee that Microsoft deploys OpenAI's technology safely, especially as it nears AGI. 

Microsoft also stands to gain from OpenAI becoming a for-profit company. The current setup caps investor returns, so a more standard structure would give Microsoft a chance to receive formal equity and significant returns, in addition to access to OpenAI's tech. 

Bloomberg reports that the two companies have been negotiating an equity stake for Microsoft in the low- to mid-30% range.

    Just make sure to keep VDDIO powered when 5V is applied to any GPIO pad, otherwise the pad will be damaged. And be sure to read the relevant sections in the updated datasheet.

This is great news!

Right now the ""rp2350 mini zero"" costs me about 4.50€/unit to source on aliexpress, while the rp2040-zero costs me about 2€/unit.So I'm probably going to stick to the rp2040 for now. I'm looking forward to eventually switching to the faster rp2350 if the price drops a little bit.

All the hardware changes and most of the bootrom changes went into A3. A4 is only a minor bootrom update.The chance of an A3-only errata is tiny.

It blends culture-war politics and industry giveaways with at times naïve techno-optimism.

A number of the executive orders and announcements coming from the White House since Donald Trump returned to office have painted an ambitious vision for America's AI future—crushing competition with China, abolishing “woke” AI models that suppress conservative speech, jump-starting power-hungry AI data centers. But the details have been sparse. 

The White House's AI Action Plan, released last week, is meant to fix that. Many of the points in the plan won't come as a surprise, and you've probably heard of the big ones by now. Trump wants to boost the buildout of data centers by slashing environmental rules; withhold funding from states that pass “burdensome AI regulations”; and contract only with AI companies whose models are “free from top-down ideological bias.”

But if you dig deeper, certain parts of the plan that didn't pop up in any headlines reveal more about where the administration's AI plans are headed. Here are three of the most important issues to watch. 

Trump is escalating his fight with the Federal Trade Commission

When Americans get scammed, they're supposed to be helped by the Federal Trade Commission. As I wrote last week, the FTC under President Biden increasingly targeted AI companies that overhyped the accuracy of their systems, as well as deployments of AI it found to have harmed consumers. 

The Trump plan vows to take a fresh look at all the FTC actions under the previous administration as part of an effort to get rid of “onerous” regulation that it claims is hampering AI's development. The administration may even attempt to repeal some of the FTC's actions entirely. This would weaken a major AI watchdog agency, but it's just the latest in the Trump administration's escalating attacks on the FTC. Read more in my story. 

The White House is very optimistic about AI for science

The opening to the AI Action Plan describes a future where AI is doing everything from discovering new materials and drugs to “unraveling ancient scrolls once thought unreadable” to making breakthroughs in science and math. 

That type of unbounded optimism about AI for scientific discovery echoes what tech companies are promising. Some of that optimism is grounded in reality: AI's role in predicting protein structures has indeed led to material scientific wins (and just last week, Google DeepMind released a new AI meant to help interpret ancient Latin engravings). But the idea that large language models—essentially very good text prediction machines—will act as scientists in their own right has less merit so far. 

Still, the plan shows that the Trump administration wants to award money to labs trying to make it a reality, even as it has worked to slash the funding the National Science Foundation makes available to human scientists, some of whom are now struggling to complete their research. 

And some of the steps the plan proposes are likely to be welcomed by researchers, like funding to build AI systems that are more transparent and interpretable.

Despite a flurry of actions this week to extend AI leadership, the administration is dismantling the very advantages that established America's global lead in AI in the first place.

The White House's messaging on deepfakes is confused

Compared with President Biden's executive orders on AI, the new action plan is mostly devoid of anything related to making AI safer. 

However, there's a notable exception: a section in the plan that takes on the harms posed by deepfakes. In May, Trump signed legislation to protect people from nonconsensual sexually explicit deepfakes, a growing concern for celebrities and everyday people alike as generative video gets more advanced and cheaper to use. The law had bipartisan support.

Now, the White House says it's concerned about the issues deepfakes could pose for the legal system. For example, it says, “fake evidence could be used to attempt to deny justice to both plaintiffs and defendants.” It calls for new standards for deepfake detection and asks the Department of Justice to create rules around it. Legal experts I've spoken with are more concerned with a different problem: Lawyers are adopting AI models that make errors such as citing cases that don't exist, which judges may not catch. This is not addressed in the action plan. 

It's also worth noting that just days before releasing a plan that targets “malicious deepfakes,” President Trump shared a fake AI-generated video of former president Barack Obama being arrested in the Oval Office.

Overall, the AI Action Plan affirms what President Trump and those in his orbit have long signaled: It's the defining social and political weapon of our time. They believe that AI, if harnessed correctly, can help them win everything from culture wars to geopolitical conflicts. The right AI, they argue, will help defeat China. Government pressure on leading companies can force them to purge “woke” ideology from their models. 

The plan includes crowd-pleasers—like cracking down on deepfakes—but overall, it reflects how tech giants have cozied up to the Trump administration. The fact that it contains almost no provisions challenging their power shows how their investment in this relationship is paying off.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","This startup wants to use the Earth as a massive battery","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/29/1120765/earth-battery-quidnet/","Tue, 29 Jul 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

A recent test shows that Quidnet's technology can store energy in pressurized water underground for months at a time.

The Texas-based startup Quidnet Energy just completed a test showing it can store energy for up to six months by pumping water underground.

Using water to store electricity is hardly a new concept—pumped hydropower storage has been around for over a century. But the company hopes its twist on the technology could help bring cheap, long-duration energy storage to new places.

Sodium-ion batteries are popping up in electric scooters and grid storage installations.

In traditional pumped hydro storage facilities, electric pumps move water uphill, into a natural or manmade body of water. Then, when electricity is needed, that water is released and flows downhill past a turbine, generating electricity. Quidnet's approach instead pumps water down into impermeable rock formations and keeps it under pressure so it flows up when released. “It's like pumped hydro, upside down,” says CEO Joe Zhou.

Quidnet started a six-month test of its technology in late 2024, pressurizing the system. In June, the company was able to discharge 35 megawatt-hours of energy from the well. There was virtually no self-discharge, meaning no energy loss, Zhou says.

Inexpensive forms of energy storage that can store electricity for weeks or months could help inconsistent electricity sources like wind and solar go further for the grid. And Quidnet's approach, which uses commercially available equipment, could be deployed quickly and qualify for federal tax credits to help make it even cheaper.

However, there's still a big milestone ahead: turning the pressurized water back into electricity. The company is currently building a facility with the turbines and support equipment to do that—all the components are available to purchase from established companies. “We don't need to invent new things based on what we've already developed today,” Zhou says. “We can now start just deploying at very, very substantial scales.”

That process will come with energy losses. Energy storage systems are typically measured by their round-trip efficiency: how much of the electricity that's put into the system is returned at the end as electricity. Modeling suggests that Quidnet's technology could reach a maximum efficiency of about 65%, Zhou says, though some design choices made to optimize for economics will likely cause the system to land at roughly 50%.

Even US manufacturers could feel the effects of higher prices.

That's less efficient than lithium-ion batteries, but long-duration systems, if they're cheap enough, can operate at low efficiencies and still be useful for the grid, says Paul Denholm, a senior research fellow at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

“It's got to be cost-competitive; it all comes down to that,” Denholm says.

Lithium-ion batteries, the fastest-growing technology in energy storage, are the target that new forms of energy storage, like Quidnet's, must chase. Lithium-ion batteries are about 90% cheaper today than they were 15 years ago. They've become a price-competitive alternative to building new natural-gas plants, Denholm says.

When it comes to competing with batteries, one potential differentiator for Quidnet could be government subsidies. While the Trump administration has clawed back funding for clean energy technologies, there's still an energy storage tax credit, though recently passed legislation added new supply chain restrictions.

Starting in 2026, new energy storage facilities hoping to qualify for tax credits will need to prove that at least 55% of the value of a project's materials are not from foreign entities of concern. That rules out sourcing batteries from China, which dominates battery production today. Quidnet has a “high level of domestic content” and expects to qualify for tax credits under the new rules, Zhou says.

The facility Quidnet is building is a project with utility partner CPS Energy, and it should come online in early 2026.  

The tech giant just signed a deal to buy fusion power. Meanwhile, company emissions are up 50% since 2019.

Tens of millions of dollars in NSF grants have been slashed, and scientists fear the US is about to lose a generation of climate researchers.

Can the vast and sparsely populated African country translate its renewable power potential into national development?

When Guillermo del Toro finally got the chance to make his dream project, an adaptation of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, you just knew it was going to be beautiful. Del Toro's films are known for a lot of things, and sumptuous production design and costumes are right near the top of the list. So, it almost goes without saying that a group of new images from the film are stunning, but these almost go beyond that.

First revealed in an article by Vanity Fair and then released by Netflix, 10 new images from Frankenstein show characters, scenes, and interpretations that were previously kept secret. Here they are, all at once, and we can discuss a few of them in more detail below.

Clearly, we could write tomes on the beauty of each of these images. The costumes, the sets, the locations. Each one is also framed in an interesting way that helps tell a story. But, we won't do that. What we will do, though, is fill in a few questions about who's who in these photos. Del Toro himself is just in that first image, along with Oscar Isaac as Dr. Victor Frankenstein. We see Victor in his lab in a later photo, too. The photo on the steps is of Victor as a child with his mother, and a little later, you see Victor again (played at a younger age by Christian Convery) with his father, played by Charles Dance.

The photo of someone holding a photo is, indeed, Elordi's monster, who we see covered in a cloak further down. Mia Goth plays Elizabeth, Victor's soon-to-be sister-in-law, who both he and the monster become infatuated with. The second photo of Goth is with her fiancé, Victor's brother William Frankenstein, played by Felix Kammerer. That leaves the man in the top hat, an arms dealer played by Christoph Waltz, and that mysterious photo among the flowers. That's Sofia Galasso and David Bradley as a little girl and a blind man who are in the original book.

What does it all mean? We'll find out in November when Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein comes to Netflix.

Alien: Earth introduces a “ruthless” cyborg—but is there any other kind? Your bongo to Theed is now arriving; it's Morning Spoilers!

Photos from the future set of Spider-Man: Brand New Day reveal Glasgow's Bothwell Street will double as Lexington Avenue in the upcoming sequel.

The curse of an Aztec death whistle terrorizes a high school in the trailer for Whistle, starring Dafne Keen, Sophie Nélisse, Sky Yang, Jhaleil Swaby, Ali Skovbye, Percy Hynes White, Michelle Fairley, and Nick Frost.

A child's drawing comes to life in the final trailer for Sketch, starring Tony Hale and D'Arcy Carden.

A teaser trailer for the demonic-possession movie, Traumatika, claims any footage from the film is too intense to show.

We also have a trailer for Lineage, the fifth and allegedly final film in the Hell House LLC series.

During a recent press event attended by Comic Book, Alien: Earth actor Babou Ceesay revealed his character is a “ruthless” cyborg.

I don't even want to give away his backstory… but he's a cyborg, let's just say that. When I say cyborg, what do you think? This is interesting. People have been saying odd things to me when I tell them I'm a cyborg. So some people think that he's all machine when they say ‘cyborg,' but that's not it. He's human and flawed in a human way. Whereas you've got people who are synths, who are, I guess, AI brains with synthetic bodies and then you've got the hybrids that are both. So he's a cyborg. The best way I can describe him, he's like an iPhone 1 in a world of iPhone 20s. But what he does have is an unbelievable clarity in terms of what he wants to do and a determination. He's ruthless for that reason.

Finally, during a recent episode of Peacemaker: The Official Podcast (via Comic Book), James Gunn stated every character name dropped in the first season of Peacemaker is likely still canon in the new DCU, barring Bat-Mite.

I will say that everything in the [first season episode Best Friends For Never] is canon except for maybe Bat-Mite. He's one of my favorite characters, but I can't say for sure that Bat-Mite is real. He's a wonderful character from the comics. He's an Imp from the Fifth Dimension who looks creepy and dresses in a little Batman costume. Except the ears are bent, because it's a really ill-fitting Batman costume. He's got skinny little legs [and] a fat little body, and he worships Batman. And so he tries to create these extraordinary circumstances for Batman to prove he's a hero, and it's these nightmarish scenarios.

Elon Musk is both the wealthiest person in the world and a major contractor for the U.S. military as the head of SpaceX. When the billionaire talks about war and its potential consequences, we need to listen, whether we like it or not. But if you've been paying attention to what Musk has been saying about the positive aspects of war in recent months, you're probably hearing things that make you nervous.

“Throughout history, any civilization that experiences extended periods of prosperity with no serious threat of invasion has low birth rates after a few generations,” Musk wrote on X Monday. “One can debate the cause, but not the correlation. The Romans lamented this constantly.”

It's no secret that Musk is obsessed with the Roman Empire. But he seems to really be fixated on the supposed causes of its fall, using those claims to rationalize his own right-wing worldview in 2025. Musk believes the world is in danger of collapsing because people aren't having enough kids. Well, to be more precise, he's worried wealthy people from Western countries aren't having enough kids.

Musk also seems to suggest that peace is bad for a country's growth with his tweet on Monday. He was more explicit about his idea that war might be good a couple of months ago. Musk gave an interview to Bloomberg News back in May, appearing remotely via video link for the Qatar Economic Forum in Doha. “When you have an extended period of prosperity with no existential war, there's no cleansing function for unnecessary laws and regulations,” Musk said.

“When you have an extended period of prosperity with no existential war, there's no cleansing function for unnecessary laws and regulations.”

Not exactly something you want to hear from one of the most powerful men in the country who also happens to be a defense contractor.

The interview was one of the most unhinged that Musk gave during his time as the head of DOGE, the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. The billionaire called the woman who was interviewing him an NPC or non-playable character, and threatened anyone who was coming after him with prison time. Things have changed, obviously, as Musk had a falling out with President Trump and is no longer officially part of the U.S. federal government. He theoretically can't go knock on the door at DOJ and tell Pam Bondi to start arresting people anymore. But that doesn't mean he lost all his influence, as the billionaire still holds tremendous power as a defense contractor. And that's what makes his outlook on war so frightening.

If Musk thinks that war can be good or have a “cleansing function,” it certainly incentivizes people like him to push for more violence around the world. And the SpaceX CEO's motives are typically pretty transparent. The Washington Post conducted an analysis that concluded Musk's companies have gotten at least $38 billion in contracts, loans, subsidies, and tax credits from the U.S. government over the past two decades. When the U.S. military and intelligence agencies launch more satellites, Musk's companies benefit. And his personal wealth owes a lot to government handouts.

Not a single dollar was stripped from Musk's companies during his great ransacking of the federal government with DOGE, according to the news outlet NOTUS. But Tesla did lose out on an electric vehicle tax credit with the “Big Beautiful Bill,” the issue that seemed to really divide Musk and Trump. Musk insisted he didn't care about the tax credit, but Trump repeatedly said it was the reason Musk was upset with him.

Musk and Trump have an uneasy relationship, especially after the Tesla CEO accused Trump of being in the Epstein files. But Musk still can influence policy, as was demonstrated when Trump threatened to cut off funding to his companies, but reporting from the Wall Street Journal noted SpaceX was just too vital to discard. And as long as Musk is considered crucial to the functioning of the U.S. military, we should probably pay attention to the things he says about war. Especially when he's making claims that it's good for any given society.

Sony's new controller for PS5 is unlike any of its other twin-stick, two-handed controllers, and not for all the obvious reasons. Sony's “Project Defiant” fight stick now has a new name, FlexStrike, and a vague release date—2026. But the more intriguing, and more annoying, aspect of the fight stick is how it will connect to your PlayStation 5 or PlayStation 5 Pro.

The FlexStrike features all the face buttons and triggers of a regular DualSense controller along with a single Japanese-type fight stick with a ball top. All the buttons are based on mechanical switches, which should offer a more tactile, clicky experience than anything you get with a controller. What's special about the FlexStrike is it includes a bottom panel that's stacked with several different types of restrictor gates. There's a square, octagon, and circle gate that plug in underneath the stick to offer a feel that's specific to your favorite arcade cabinets.

See PS 5 at Amazon

See PS 5 Pro at Amazon

All that would be good enough for today's demanding fighting game aficionados. However, FlexStrike isn't just any other Bluetooth controller; it's also using a proprietary connectivity standard called PlayStation Link. It's a 2.4GHz connectivity that's specific to PlayStation through a special connectivity codec and offers faster response times than Bluetooth. Microsoft uses a similar proprietary standard for devices to connect to the Xbox Series X (you can't connect Bluetooth headsets to Xbox consoles without an adapter). Sony hasn't talked about this standard since early 2024, when it debuted the PlayStation Pulse Elite headset and Pulse Explore wireless earbuds. Both those devices use a USB-A adapter you need to plug into your PS5 or PC first. The new version coming with FlexStrike uses USB-C. That's a pretty important change, since the slim version of the PS5 and the PS5 Pro no longer have USB-A on the front panel.

You can connect up to two FlexStrike controllers to a single PlayStation Link and use them alongside your Pulse audio products. Your regular DualSense controllers work over Bluetooth, and Sony said you can have both going at the same time should you want to swap back and forth for navigating menus. If you don't want to plug the PlayStation Link into your PC or console, you can use a simple wired connection instead.

In the time since PlayStation Link hit the scene, Sony has made numerous updates to its consoles and pushed out its $700 PlayStation Pro console. Why Sony didn't simply build PlayStation Link into its premium gaming hardware is a mystery I couldn't begin to solve. If companies continue to use proprietary 2.4GHz codecs, then they should be more like HP with its HP Omen Max gaming laptop, which makes the connection to the company's own products seamless.

Sony should start thinking about a universal 2.4GHz connection for all its products. The company also sells Inzone buds and headsets for gaming with a separate 2.4GHz dongle, which isn't the same codec as PlayStation Link. Then there are products like the Bravia Theater U neck speaker, which plugs into a PS5 controller to access the console's touted 3D audio features. Why, oh why, can't we have a single dongle for everything? Or, you know what's even better? No dongle at all for low-latency connections.

Despite how Ross' paleontology career is treated by his companions in Friends, there's something special about finding the remains of creatures that lived millions if not billions of years before us. In fact, humanity's interest in paleontology isn't a modern development. Ancient Romans were just as fascinated by fossils.

According to the ancient Roman historian Suetonius, Emperor Augustus established the first known paleontological museum at his villa on the island of Capri, where he showcased the bones of ancient “giants” and “monsters.” While paleontologists have yet to uncover such fantastical remains, a study published Thursday in the journal Science describes something that, in my opinion, is even more special—an ancient Roman amulet crafted from the fossil of a critter that lived between 453 and 460 million years ago.

The researchers claim that the artifact “represents the first documented trilobite in the Roman world and the earliest known reference to this fossil group—and the intentional manipulation of a trilobite specimen—in all of classical antiquity,” they wrote in the study. Trilobites are a group of marine arthropods that existed between 521 and 251 million years ago. It's also the “third trilobite in the global archaeological record to have been collected and used by people over a thousand years ago,” they added.

The rare artifact came to light in a Roman settlement in northwestern Spain called A Cibdá of Armea that existed from the first to the third century CE. The researchers suggest that the fossil itself originated in shale outcrops over 267 miles (430 kilometers) away from the Roman settlement. The trilobite likely reached the settlement via trade or as the property of someone from central Lusitania (a Roman province in Spain) moving to the region.

Either way, someone clearly altered the fossil. “The Armea trilobite fragment unquestionably shows evidence of anthropic work, particularly on the underside and left side of the piece,” the researchers explained. “These marks do not affect the upper surface, which displays the characteristic articulated segments of a trilobite's dorsal exoskeleton. It seems clear that the person who modified the stone intended to leave that natural surface untouched, while simultaneously adapting the fossil to its new function.”

According to the study, the modified fossil could have functioned as a game token, a part of a necklace or bracelet, a banded pendant on a metallic mount, or simply an object people carried in their bag or pocket. Regardless of how the trilobite was fashioned, it was likely kept for supernatural, propitiatory, or medicinal purposes and abandoned between the first and third centuries CE.

“It is plausible to consider that the Armea trilobite may have been perceived to hold magical and protective powers for its wearer, as is the case with fossils or even trilobites in other well-known archaeological contexts,” the researchers wrote. Coincidentally, archaeologists found the trilobite next to a bronze coin of Augustus.

The discovery is a testament to the fact that humanity's curiosity for that which came before us is a universal trait that transcends cultures, borders, and even time itself. It stands as a reassuring reminder, especially in times like these—when the only thing everyone seems to agree on is our many differences.

Samsung really nailed it with the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. These wireless earbuds come packed with smart AI features and noise cancellation that actually works – no empty promises here. They even scored Gizmodo's Editors' Choice, which says a lot.

If you've got a Samsung phone, these buds are like a dream come true and they leave the AirPods Pro trailing behind. Right now, Amazon has them at an all-time low of $189, which is down from $249, so this deal is definitely worth taking.

See at Amazon

The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro come with a package of technology that should improve your listening experience in smarter ways: To begin with, the active noise cancellation (ANC) is excellent. It not only minimizes ambient noise but it also adapts to your environment and activities so your favorite music or calls sound richer. You can switch ANC modes or ambient sound mode, which lets you stay aware of what's around you without needing to take the earbuds out.

You'll also enjoy the AI-driven sound optimization: They read your ear shape and personalize the sound settings to match you to a T. The customized tuning allows the audio quality to sound like a personal prescription and every note comes through richer and more balanced. The sound itself is also balanced with deep bass, sharp highs and clear mids.

Samsung redesigned the earbuds for a fit that is comfortable but not intrusive: You can wear them for long hours without discomfort which is crucial when you're using them through the day for calls. The design also helps with passive noise isolation and adds another layer of quiet to complement the ANC. And with their lightweight build, carrying these earbuds around in your pocket or bag is effortless.

They also have smart features that are convenient to use on a daily basis: You can easily control with touch controls by pausing, playing, skipping tracks and turning on your voice assistant with just a touch. Samsung's AI interpreter can even translate real-time which is a welcome feature for the traveler or friends who speak in foreign languages. Battery life is good too, with many hours of playtime from one charge, along with extra juice when you charge through the case, so you can stay plugged in a lot longer than regular earbuds.

For $189, the earbuds offer plenty of bang for the buck, especially when you factor that the price is usually around $249.

A threat to American dominance?

China's artificial intelligence companies have launched two new strategic alliances aimed at developing AI technologies that rely on domestic standards, as well as integrating AI into industrial applications, at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, according to Reuters. The moves are designed to develop domestic AI standards and reduce reliance on American technologies as soon as possible. 

The first coalition is called the Model-Chip Ecosystem Innovation Alliance, which unites leading makers of AI hardware — such as Biren Technologies, Huawei, Enflame, and Moore Threads, among others — and developers of large language models, including StepFun. The goal of the alliance is to form a groundbreaking ecosystem that links the entire technology stack from hardware and AI models to supporting infrastructure. One of the focuses of the coalition is to streamline and localize the development of AI hardware and software amid a limited supply of foreign hardware, such as high-performance Nvidia GPUs. 

For now, it is too early to make guesses about what the Model-Chip Ecosystem Innovation Alliance can do and what it is capable of achieving. However, to have a chance of success, members of the group will have to seek standardization and interoperability. That said, expect the union to establish common protocols, interfaces, and frameworks between models, chips, and infrastructure to streamline development and reduce fragmentation within China's AI ecosystem. 

Chinese AI hardware companies use different architectures (Arm, PowerVR, custom instruction set architectures), which complicates low-level unification, so do not expect Huawei's CANN to support processors not developed by Huawei. 

However, developers can agree on standardized APIs and model formats, allowing LLMs trained by StepFun, or its competitors, to run across multiple backends with minimal friction. Also, companies can unify mid-level software stacks to enable model portability and compatibility across all local platforms. Developers will write models once (e.g., in PyTorch) and run them on any Chinese-made accelerator without major changes. In addition, this will promote a cohesive national AI ecosystem where all components — processors, compilers, frameworks, and tools — work together. In a unified environment, innovation can develop faster, and China's AI industry becomes more resilient and competitive on the global stage, which is when it will be able to compete against the American AI industry. 

The second initiative, known as the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce AI Committee, aims to help integrate AI more deeply into industrial applications. This alliance unites such hardware and software companies as Iluvatar CoreX, MetaX, MiniMax, and SenseTime, just to name a few. Essentially, the alliance will function as a bridge between AI developers and industrial players, ensuring that cutting-edge models and systems actively power China's industrial transformation. 

Both alliances are meant not only to create a self-sufficient AI ecosystem in China, but also to streamline its development as well as the adoption of AI by the industry.

But how will it power them?

The European Union is the world's second-largest economy in terms of GDP, but when it comes to its place on the AI market, its position is by far not as strong. To catch up with the U.S. and China, the bloc is launching a $30 billion initiative to build a network of high-capacity data centers that can host millions of AI GPUs, reports CNBC. If successful, the EU will have gigawatt-class datacenters with performance akin to that owned by leading U.S. companies.

To date, the European Union has allocated €10 billion (approximately $11.8 billion) to establish 13 AI data centers, alongside an additional €20 billion earmarked as initial funding for a network of gigawatt-class AI facilities. So far, the project has attracted 76 expressions of interest from 16 member states, covering a total of 60 potential locations, according to CNBC. Initial launches are underway, with the first AI factory expected to go live in the coming weeks and a large-scale project in Munich planned for early September.

Each gigawatt datacenter is expected to require €3 to €5 billion and deliver a level of computational power far greater than existing AI data centers, potentially supporting over 100,000 advanced AI GPUs per site, according to estimates by UBS cited by CNBC. xAI's Colossus cuper cluster consumes about 150 MW of power when equipped with 100,000 H100 GPUs, so a gigawatt facility will probably be able to host many more GPUs. Perhaps, 300,000 Blackwell Ultra processors.

The EU's effort, if realized, is probably one of the world's largest publicly funded initiatives in artificial intelligence, probably well below what Chinese authorities (both federal and local) have invested in AI data centers, but well ahead of what other big economies invest in their AI efforts.

Henna Virkkunen, European Commission executive vice president for technology policy, told CNBC that while Europe has a strong talent base — reportedly 30% more AI researchers per capita than the U.S. — their limited access to computing has held back development. Building massive AI data centers is designed to solve this problem and kick-start the AI sector across the EU.

Despite strong public interest, the scale and sustainability of the project remain in question. Bertin Martens of Bruegel noted that while the EU has committed taxpayer funding, it is unclear how much the public sector will invest in the project. Also, the specifications of the upcoming data centers are unclear. While the EU has access to Nvidia GPUs and other advanced AI accelerators developed in America through a trade agreement with the U.S., Martens pointed out that acquiring hardware is only the beginning.

Also, running these data centers profitably and using them to create world-class AI products requires business model development, thorough planning, and interest from private companies, Martens noted. As a result, the AI buildout in Europe may be very gradual to avoid mistakes made by Chinese authorities.

But perhaps power supply is the biggest concern. A single gigawatt-class data center requires an enormous amount of power, but building such generation capacity takes years. Martens cautioned that Europe's current grid infrastructure might not be ready to support such high loads, and massive upgrades will likely be needed, which will stretch schedules of the project.

Core Ultra 5 packing PC measures just 108 x 95 x 43mm (0.44 liters, 14.9 fl oz), but AAEON's design cancels out any potential cuteness.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Edge computing specialist Aaeon has rolled out the tiny new PICO-MTU4-SEMI, which it claims to be the “world's smallest Intel Core Ultra-powered Mini PC.” This Intel Core Ultra 5 Processor 125U-packing PC measures just 108 x 95 x 43mm (about 0.44 liters, 14.9 fl oz). Searching our archives for smaller Core Ultra PCs seems to support the compactness claims, with the Aaeon being noticeably smaller than the MSI Cubi NUC 1M that we previously featured, for example.

The Aaeon PICO-MTU4-SEMI design gets bonus points for being entirely passive; however, it must lose some for looking like something you'd tether to the back of an Acorn Electron. Readers are also likely to be uneasy regarding the port selection. However, the limited internal expansion options seem like an understandable constraint here.



Knowing that this is a device targeting installation within “industrial robots and AGVs while still providing a broad selection of interfaces for peripheral devices such as cameras and sensors,” provides some background to the port selection. Thus, the PICO-MTU4-SEMI bristles with the familiar DB9 style ports, common on such devices. These are mostly intended for legacy-friendly COM ports, facilitating RS-232/422/485 serial communication with various industrial devices and machinery. We see on this new Aaeon that one is also a GPIO, for further I/O control flexibility. All these 9-pin ports are tagged as ‘optional' in Aaeon's spec sheets.

Sticking to the topic of ports, around the other side of the device, you will find a meager pair of USB 3.2 Type-A ports, 2.5GbE and 1GbE LAN ports, a single display output in the shape of an HDMI 1.4 connector, and a DC-in jack. That isn't a lot, but one assumes Aaeon must know its business audience.



Moving inside the 1.10-pound (0.60kg) PICO-MTU4-SEMI, Aaeon quips either an Intel Core Ultra 5 Processor 125U, or there's an Ultra 7 165U for the speed freaks. Both these chips have a processor base power of 15W.

Aaeon feeds the passively cooled Intel processors with up to 32GB of soldered single-channel LPDDR5. Meanwhile, an M.2 2280 SSD slot is ready for your choice of fixed storage device (PCIe Gen 4 and SATA compatible). A vacant M.2 2230 E-Key slot will most likely be used by those wanting on-board Wi-Fi connectivity.

The PICO-MTU4-SEMI is compatible with Windows 10 or 11, as well as Ubuntu Linux 22.04.2, specifies Aaeon. We don't have pricing or retail links for this tiny fanless Core Ultra 5-powered Mini PC. If you are interested, get in touch with Aaeon directly.

Cadence admits guilt in exporting chip design tools to China's National University of Defense Technology, which is believed to be working on the Chinese nuclear program.

Cadence Design Systems, one of the leading electronic design automation (EDA) firms in the U.S., has pleaded guilty to charges, saying that it sold its chip design software to the National University of Defense Technology, located in Hunan Province in South-Central China. According to Reuters, this institution is believed to be working on nuclear explosion simulations, linking it to China's nuclear weapons research and development efforts.

The university has been on the U.S. Department of Commerce's Entity List — a list of companies, institutions, and individuals that the White House deems to be operating contrary to its national security and foreign policy interests — since 2015. Furthermore, its affiliates and aliases, including Hunan Guofang Keji University, Central South CAD Center, and CSCC, were also added to the restricted list in 2019 and 2022, respectively.

Despite this, court records reveal that the chip design company and its China subsidiary, Cadence China, delivered EDA tools to CSCC at least 56 times between 2015 and 2020. This continued even though several Cadence China employees knew that CSCC is simply an alias that NUDT used to circumvent American sanctions. Furthermore, Cadence also sold its products to Phytium Technology Co., a Chinese semiconductor company that's known to be closely working with NUDT, without applying for the proper export licenses.

The company pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit export control violations, requiring it to pay $140 million in forfeitures, civil, and criminal penalties. Aside from that, the court is also expected to put it under probation for three years, preventing it from doing business with sanctioned institutions at the risk of even harsher penalties.

The U.S. has lifted a ban on the general export of EDA tools, including those from Cadence, earlier this month. However, this lifting only makes it readily available to institutions that aren't included in the Entity List. So, any company that wants to do business with NUDT and its affiliates must still acquire a proper export license from the Federal government.

Cadence, so far, is the biggest company to have pleaded guilty to breaking American sanctions on Chinese companies. However, it's not the only one facing scrutiny. Nvidia, the current world leader in AI semiconductors, has seen billions of dollars' worth of its AI chips smuggled into China. While its CEO, Jensen Huang, continues to deny that its chips are being diverted, there is a thriving black market in China for banned GPUs like the B200 and RTX 5090.

The U.S. is tightening its grip on export controls, even pressuring its allies like Singapore and Malaysia to clamp down on smuggling rings. However, the massive demand in China makes smuggling AI technologies quite lucrative, making it nearly impossible to stop completely.

Existing H20 stockpiles are quickly dwindling


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Nvidia's China strategy is shifting once again. According to Reuters, the company has placed a fresh order for 300,000 H20 AI GPUs with TSMC, spurred by unexpectedly strong demand from Chinese tech giants. This move comes just weeks after the Trump administration reversed an April ban on the H20, a China-specific chip designed to comply with U.S. export controls but still powerful enough to dominate AI inference workloads.

The decision marks a reversal of Nvidia's earlier stance. CEO Jensen Huang, during a recent visit to Beijing, had hinted that H20 production would remain paused unless customer demand justified a restart—something that would take nine months to spin up. But with existing stockpiles of 600,000–700,000 H20 units quickly dwindling, and reports of smuggling and a booming repair market for banned GPUs, Nvidia is clearly seeing enough momentum to justify new orders.

For context, the H20 is not a regular flagship GPU. While it lacks the raw power of Nvidia's actual flagship H100 or the newer Blackwell series, industry insiders say it's finely tuned for AI inference tasks, with some experts noting that it can even outperform the H100 in certain workloads. Chinese tech heavyweights like Tencent, ByteDance, and Alibaba had already stockpiled these chips ahead of the April ban, often pairing them with DeepSeek's cost-optimized AI models.

Yet the U.S. government has not fully cleared the path. Nvidia still requires export licenses for these shipments, and sources told Reuters that the Commerce Department has yet to approve them. In the meantime, Nvidia is asking Chinese customers to submit detailed order forecasts and documentation, signaling a more tightly controlled distribution pipeline.



Financially, the stakes are massive for the Green Team. After the April ban, Nvidia warned of a potential $5.5 billion inventory write-off and an additional $15 billion in lost sales — a hit that would have dented its lead in the AI hardware race. For context, Nvidia sold roughly 1 million H20 chips in 2024, meaning this latest TSMC order represents nearly a third of last year's total volume.

The political backlash, however, is intensifying. Twenty U.S. national security experts, including former officials from the Bush and Trump administrations, have urged the Commerce Department to reinstate the H20 ban, warning that the chip is “a potent accelerator of China's frontier AI capabilities.” Their letter argues that the H20's inference performance could bolster China's military AI efforts and weaken U.S. export control policies, something that Jensen Huang has disagreed with before.

Despite this pressure, Nvidia is betting that keeping its software ecosystem entrenched in China is critical to maintaining its dominance. If Chinese developers migrate fully to Huawei's competing solutions, the long-term loss could be far greater than any short-term political fallout. The H20 may not be Nvidia's flagship, but in the high-stakes U.S.-China tech rivalry, it's becoming a chip that symbolizes far more than just performance.

The first was a sustained distributed denial-of-service attack on Crimean forces; the second was reportedly destructive.

Hacking groups are continuing to launch cyberattacks on Russia as a show of solidarity with Ukraine—whose military intelligence agency reportedly conducted an operation of its own against Russia-occupied Crimea—as the conflict between the countries continues.

RBC-Ukraine reported that Ukraine ""carried out a large-scale special operation targeting the occupation authorities in Crimea"" that culminated in ""a powerful DDoS attack [that] effectively paralyzed the information systems and network infrastructure in Crimea.""

Although there are exceptions, like when someone finds a way to send dozens of terabytes of traffic per second to a single target, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks usually aren't very sophisticated. They simply bombard their target with too much traffic for it to handle.

But sophistication is not a prerequisite for effectiveness—especially when a DDoS attack causes enough of a distraction for Ukraine to steal a reported 100TB of data from other targets before ""[wiping] all data stored on the servers of regional and district government bodies, ministries, and agencies of the occupation administration in Crimea,"" per RBC-Ukraine.

This combination of a DDoS attack and another operation is so common that it can make responding to a DDoS attack more complex than simply mitigating the immediate service disruptions. Organizations also have to determine if the DDoS attack is merely a distraction, like it was here, and if so, what exactly it was supposed to be distracting them from.

That puts organizations in a lose-lose situation. Assuming that a DDoS attack is a distraction means they have to devote resources to figuring out if something else is happening in addition to mitigating the DDoS itself; assuming that a DDoS attack isn't a distraction means they might not notice the signs of a larger operation until it's too late.

Ukraine's military intelligence agency wasn't alone in carrying out destructive cyberattacks against Russia. The Kyiv Independent reported that the Silent Crow and Belarusian Cyber Partisans hacking groups conducted a similar operation against a Russian airline called Aeroflot.

Aeroflot reportedly had to ground ""dozens of flights to and from Moscow"" on July 28 due to ""a massive malfunction in its information system."" Silent Crow was quick to claim responsibility, claiming that it ""completely destroyed the company's IT infrastructure"" after a year of preparation.

These attacks both arrived shortly after a joint operation from Ukraine's military intelligence agency, the Ukrainian Cyber Alliance, and BO Team reportedly wreaked havoc on a supplier of drones to Russia's military. Don't be surprised if similar attacks—conducted with or without support from Ukraine's military—continue in the weeks and months ahead.

Disability-based discrimination was reported by 12.4% of medical students with disabilities in the US, with the highest rates being reported by those with chronic illnesses and multiple disabilities. Clinical clerkship faculty and residents were frequently cited as sources of discrimination.

“To address these issues, programs should foster an inclusive clinical educational culture, where students are empowered to report discrimination without fear of retaliation, train faculty and residents on disability awareness and inclusive teaching strategies, and learning happens in universally designed settings,” the authors of the study wrote.

“Ensuring that faculty understand the concept and goals of reasonable accommodations is important; resources offered by the AAMC can assist in these efforts. Involving medical students and faculty with disabilities and chronic disease in these efforts is essential and underscores the value of disability representation in medicine,” experts wrote in an invited commentary.

The study was led by Mytien Nguyen, MS, of the Department of Immunobiology at the Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. It was published online on July 28, 2025, in JAMA Internal Medicine.

The self-reported and cross-sectional data may have led to an underestimation of how often discrimination occurred and uncertainty about the exact causes of discriminatory experiences.

Hydroxychloroquine exposure in patients with lupus nephritis was associated with a substantially lower risk for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline of ≥ 30%, particularly among those with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage ≥ III.

“These findings emphasize the importance of starting early and continuing HCQ [hydroxychloroquine] therapy to preserve kidney health alongside overall disease control even if SLE [systemic lupus erythematosus] is limited to the kidneys [lupus nephritis],” the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Shivani Garg, MD, PhD, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine & Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin. It was published online on July 20, 2025, in Arthritis Care & Research.

The single academic institution setting potentially affected population representation. Data on hydroxychloroquine blood levels were unavailable to assess adherence and absorption variability. Decline of eGFR may have been missed in patients lost to follow-up or those who died at outside institutions.

This study received support from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Institute for Clinical and Translational Research and the Clinical and Translational Science Award program from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences.

The deadline for applying to residency programs is approaching, and as you prepare to apply to your chosen programs, here are some strategies to streamline the process while you get your plans and materials in order.

Consider these tips to keep you on track and organized.

Start early and get organized. Whether your specialty uses Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) or another application platform, timelines with all key dates for the season are out. Keep this information handy and set alerts so you stay on track, recommended Meredith C. Thompson, MD, MAEd, associate professor and interim vice chair of Education, and interim assistant dean of student affairs, Department of Emergency Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Florida Health/Shands Hospital in Gainesville, Florida.

The ERAS system begins accepting applications on September 3.

Do your research. “Formulate a system to compare and keep track of all the programs you're interested in. This includes any program characteristics that are important to you and your perceived competitiveness for the program. Your advisor can help with that, as can reputable data sources like Texas Star, AAMC [Association of American Medical Colleges] residency explorer or other specialty organization advising resources,” Thompson said. Another tip: Many programs also maintain social media presence and host virtual meet and greets on these platforms for applicants.

Concentrate on recommendations. Ask for letters of recommendation at least 1 month in advance. “Your goal is to have all application elements submitted by the time the platform opens to programs for viewing,” advised Thompson. Ensuring all items are received on time is key to maximizing your chances of obtaining interviews, she said.

Assemble your team. Applying to residency is not a solo endeavor, so Thompson explained it's in your best interest to build a team to support you during the process. “Key persons to have in your corner include a specialty specific advisor, editor, and interview preparer,” she said. Check your medical school's resources as many institutions provide students with access to a specialty specific advisor that can provide evidenced based advice personalized to your unique situation during the application process. If this is not available, Thompson recommended connecting to your student affairs dean who typically can help you with this information or guide you to appropriate data sources to help make these decisions.

Lean on a support team. Complete one or more practice interviews with someone familiar with the interview format for your chosen specialty to become more comfortable, she suggested. “Your support team is key in ensuring you are putting your best foot forward during the application and interview process,” Thompson said.

Proofread your materials. Make sure all sections are completed and that your information is free from typos, said Mitchell Goldman, MD, senior associate dean for graduate medical education, professor of medicine, and designated institutional official at the University of Missouri School of Medicine in Columbia, Missouri. “You want to impress anyone who reads your application and leave an impression of professionalism,” Goldman stated. “Recommend having an experienced educator review your personal statement before submission to identify opportunities for improvement.”

Be honest and genuine in your application. Goldman said to list hobbies, interests, and volunteer experiences that you could discuss in detail if asked about them during an interview.

Be realistic in the scope. If you are applying to highly competitive specialties, consider a back-up plan and apply to acceptable programs or specialties, Goldman said. “You want to be realistic about the programs you apply to and have a good chance for getting an interview at a number of programs,” he said.

Be proactive. Reach out early and often for guidance from trusted sources. They may have prudent advice to share. In addition, be sure to follow-up. If your dream program hasn't extended an interview, consider sending an email to the program director and coordinator. “Send only one (follow-up) email to communicate genuine interest,” Thompson said. “Application season is not the time to take a wait and see approach.”

Your medical school's student affairs office is a wealth of information for your residency-application process. They can provide guidance on evidence-based resources to inform your decision making. Also, your medical school may have a career advising program that can identify local specialty specific advisors to give personalized guidance. “In addition to this, they can be a resource to review personal statements, provide mock practice interviews, and assess your total application for your competitiveness for different programs,” Thompson said. Finally, medical school alumni programs can also be a resource for these types of services.

Residency allows you to focus on your unique interests and talents. “This is rewarding as it allows you to enhance your clinical skills to more meaningfully contribute to patient care in a particular niche as well as develop professionally under the guidance of experts and a network of physicians with similar career goals,” said Thompson. “Moreover, you gain a cadre of coresidents that share the journey with you that you can learn from and lean on for support.”

Your residency is also a time where you can be immersed in your area of interest, be educated by those with extensive expertise and teaching skills and a time of rapid growth in your personal and professional life, said Goldman. “Residency experiences are some of the most rewarding experiences of a physician's life,” he said. “It is also a time to have fun being with individuals with shared interest. You can make life-long friends, learn about yourself and what you value most moving forward.”

Individuals who took extended daytime naps or had inadequate nighttime sleep faced a significantly increased risk for incident atrial fibrillation (AF), with a threefold increased risk among those with both factors.

""[The study] findings might have important clinical and public health implications, as sleep patterns could be a modifiable risk factor for AF,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Jesús Díaz-Gutiérrez, of the University Hospital Juan Ramon Jiménez in Huelva, Spain. It was published online on July 24, 2025, in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology.

The sleep habits were self-reported by participants and assessed only at baseline, without accounting for changes over time. The study population was restricted to university graduates, limiting generalizability.

This study received funding from several sources, including the Spanish Government-Instituto de Salud Carlos III, the European Regional Development Fund, and the Navarra Regional Government. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

JAK inhibitors demonstrated significantly higher risk for venous thromboembolism than dupilumab and methotrexate in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) in a retrospective study.

Based on the results, “patients with AD initiating JAK inhibitors are at an elevated risk of PE and DVT as compared to those managed by dupilumab,” and JAK inhibitors “were associated with an increased risk of DVT as compared to methotrexate,” the authors of the study wrote. These results, they concluded, “support a cautious, individualized approach to the use of JAK inhibitors, particularly in patients with elevated baseline thromboembolic risk.”

The study was led by Khalaf Kridin, Lübeck Institute of Experimental Dermatology, University of Lübeck, Lübeck, Germany, and was published online on July 21 in the Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.

The study used retrospective observational data, and JAK inhibitors were analyzed as a class, not by individual drug or dose. 

The study did not receive any funding, and the authors reported having no conflicts of interest.

An international study reveals that boosting greenery could be a powerful tool that protects the brain from the harmful effects of polluted air linked to Alzheimer's and dementia worldwide.

Study: Greenness modified the association of PM2.5 and ozone with global disease burden of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Image credit: AMINSEN/Shutterstock.com

A recent study in Scientific Reports investigated whether greenness influences the association between particulate matter (PM) with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) and ozone, and whether this relationship affects the disease burden linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias.

Dementia is a collection of symptoms associated with a decline in cognitive ability, such as memory loss, difficulty with thinking, and reduced problem-solving ability, impacting daily life. AD is a type of dementia, which has been identified as the seventh leading cause of death worldwide. Approximately 55 million people worldwide have been diagnosed with AD, and this number has been predicted to rise as high as 79 million by 2030 and 139 million by 2050.

Global healthcare costs have significantly increased due to the high prevalence of dementia. Considering the increased prevalence, it is crucial to identify modifiable risk factors, particularly to prevent AD and other dementias and reduce the economic burden of the disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Lancet Commission have independently identified air pollution as an emerging risk factor of AD.

Air pollutants trigger oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in the brain, thereby increasing the risk of multiple diseases, including metabolic disorders, cardiovascular conditions, and dementia. Previous studies have established an association between PM2.5 and AD. In 2015, approximately 28% of deaths and 30% of disability-adjusted life years (DALY) were linked to dementia caused by ambient PM2.5 pollution.

Interestingly, a large-scale US-based study highlighted that higher neighbourhood greenness lowers the risk of AD and related dementias. This occurrence has been attributed to a greener environment, reducing stress by promoting physical activity and alleviating the adverse effects of air pollution. Not many studies have explored how much a greener environment impacts the association between air pollution and the global disease burden of AD and other dementias.

The current ecological study aimed to examine the relationship between air pollutants and AD burden worldwide and assess the potential to modify this association through a greener environment.

All relevant data on the incidence of AD and other dementias, related deaths, and DALY were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database. The current study's data were sourced from 162 countries, spanning 2010, 2011, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017.

PM2.5 and ozone, the two most extensively studied air pollutants in the GBD database, were considered. To evaluate the greenness exposure, this study used enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and country-level normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data from the Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The NDVI and EVI values range from -0.2 to 1.0, where higher values approaching 1.0 represent greater greenness, while any negative values highlight cloud cover, snow, or water bodies.

The current study estimated the global incidence rate of AD and other dementias, death rate, and DALY to be 55.52, 12.48, and 206.94 per 100,000 population, respectively. Global spatial distribution analysis revealed that the highest prevalence of AD, death, and DALY due to AD and other dementias occurred in Japan in 2017, followed by Italy. In contrast, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates exhibited the lowest incidence of these diseases.

During the study periods, the values of NDVI and EVI were estimated to be 0.56 and 0.33, respectively. Furthermore, PM2.5 and ozone were estimated to be 23.13 μg/m3 and 39.96 ppb, respectively. Compared to the rest of the world, a higher greenness density was observed in America and Oceania.  

As per the global landscape, the average levels of PM2.5 and ozone were higher in Asia and Africa, and lower in Europe, Oceania, and America. The Spearman correlations between air pollutants and greenness ranged between -0.36 and -0.40, indicating negative and moderate correlations.

A statistically significant association was observed between PM2.5 and ozone and the disease burden of AD and other dementias. In a fully adjusted model, a 10-unit increment in PM2.5 and ozone was associated with a 2.0% and 1.9% increase in the incidence rate of AD and other dementias, respectively. The same exposure levels were associated with a 2.8% and 9.5% increase in death rate, and a 2.2% and 6.7% increase in the DALY rate, respectively.

A robust negative association was observed between greenness and dementia, particularly at moderate levels of greenness, with weaker or non-significant associations at very high greenness levels, suggesting a non-linear relationship. The disease burden was significantly higher in countries with a low socio-demographic index (SDI) compared to middle or high SDI categories. Similarly, a higher AD and other dementia rate ratio was associated with countries with low gross national income (GNI).

The current study demonstrated that both PM2.5 and ozone were associated with reduced harmful impacts on dementia burden (rather than an actual “protective” effect) in areas with high levels of greenness, and that in some of the highest greenness quartiles, the pollutant-disease associations became insignificant or even reversed.

The findings here showed a positive association between annual average concentrations of PM2.5 and ozone exposure and the incidence, deaths, and DALYs of AD and other dementias. A greener environment could mitigate this association, particularly at moderate-to-high greenness levels. Therefore, increasing green space worldwide would positively impact health, although the protective effects of greenness may not increase linearly at the highest levels of vegetation.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for over 80% of lung cancer cases and is often diagnosed at advanced stages, limiting treatment options. While genetic and epigenetic alterations are known contributors to its pathogenesis, DNA methylation-based biomarkers are increasingly recognized for their potential in early detection and prognosis. The NF-κB signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in cancer proliferation and immune evasion. Despite its clinical relevance, few upstream regulators of this pathway have been clearly defined in NSCLC. Based on these challenges, in-depth research is needed to uncover new molecular targets that drive NSCLC development and could be leveraged in treatment strategies.

Researchers from Chongqing Medical University, Suining Central Hospital, Chongqing University, and Sichuan University have discovered that the gene NF-kappa-B-activating protein-like (NKAPL) acts as a tumor suppressor in NSCLC by stabilizing the protein tripartite motif-containing 21 (TRIM21) and thereby inhibiting NF-κB signaling. The findings (DOI: 10.1016/j.gendis.2025.101598) were published on June 20, 2025, in the journal Genes & Diseases. Through a combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments, the team demonstrated that NKAPL, frequently silenced by DNA methylation in NSCLC tissues, can suppress cancer progression when re-expressed.

The study began with a machine learning analysis of lung cancer methylation data from the TCGA database, where NKAPL ranked highly for its prognostic value. Researchers found NKAPL was significantly downregulated in NSCLC tissues due to promoter hypermethylation. Restoring NKAPL expression in lung cancer cell lines suppressed cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and reduced migration and invasion, as confirmed through CCK8 assays, colony formation, and transwell experiments. In mouse models, NKAPL overexpression led to smaller tumors and fewer metastatic lesions.

Mechanistically, mass spectrometry and immunoprecipitation revealed that NKAPL binds to and stabilizes TRIM21, a protein that regulates NF-κB signaling. TRIM21 levels increased with NKAPL expression, leading to decreased phosphorylation of p65 and inhibition of downstream inflammatory signals. Knockdown of TRIM21 reversed the tumor-suppressive effects of NKAPL, confirming its central role. These results reveal a new axis—NKAPL-TRIM21-NF-κB—that governs cancer cell behavior.

""Our study not only uncovers a novel tumor suppressor role for NKAPL but also highlights its epigenetic silencing as a key event in NSCLC progression,"" said Dr. Tingxiu Xiang, corresponding author of the study. ""The ability of NKAPL to enhance TRIM21 stability and dampen NF-κB signaling offers a promising therapeutic strategy, particularly for patients with advanced disease and limited treatment response. Further development of demethylation therapies targeting NKAPL could significantly improve patient outcomes.""

These findings pave the way for the development of new diagnostic biomarkers and targeted therapies for NSCLC. The frequent methylation of NKAPL suggests its potential utility in non-invasive screening via liquid biopsy. Therapeutically, strategies aimed at restoring NKAPL function—such as methylation inhibitors or gene delivery systems—could suppress tumor growth and metastasis by disrupting the NF-κB pathway. In the future, combination treatments involving NKAPL-targeted approaches and conventional therapies may offer more effective and personalized care for lung cancer patients.

Macrophages are versatile immune cells, tasked with cleaning up pathogens and maintaining tissue health. But within the tumor microenvironment, they often shift into an M2-like state—one that paradoxically helps tumors grow by weakening immune defenses and promoting inflammation. At the same time, cellular senescence, traditionally seen as a tumor-suppressive mechanism, can have the opposite effect in aged macrophages. These cells become chronic sources of inflammatory signals and lose their ability to destroy cancer cells. Because of these complexities, there is an urgent need to study senescent macrophages more deeply to uncover their full impact on cancer biology.

A new review published (DOI: 10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2024.0589) in Cancer Biology & Medicine by researchers at Shandong University takes an in-depth look at how aging macrophages—once thought to be passive bystanders—actively drive tumor development. Drawing on molecular biology, immunology, and emerging therapeutic strategies, the authors present the first comprehensive framework linking macrophage senescence to cancer. The study not only details the functional shifts that occur in these cells but also explores a range of cutting-edge treatments—including drugs that eliminate or reprogram them—offering new possibilities for cancer therapy.

Senescent macrophages undergo dramatic changes: they lose their tumor-fighting abilities and instead foster a microenvironment ripe for cancer growth. Marked by elevated levels of p16INK4a, p21, and SA-β-gal, these cells secrete pro-inflammatory factors like IL-6, IL-10, and VEGF, while exhibiting reduced antigen presentation and phagocytosis. Their shift toward an M2-likephenotype is accompanied by metabolic dysfunction and increased tissue infiltration—traits that undermine immune surveillance and promote metastasis. The review outlines three therapeutic approaches: senolytics, which selectively remove senescent macrophages; senomorphics, which suppress their harmful secretions (SASP); and senoreverters, which attempt to reverse their aged state. Promising agents include quercetin, fisetin, rapamycin, and even CAR-T cells designed to target aging markers. These treatments could reshape the tumor landscape by restoring immune balance and enhancing existing cancer therapies.

Senescent macrophages have been overlooked for too long. They're not just passive markers of aging—they actively reshape the tumor environment. By targeting these cells, we open up new therapeutic pathways that complement immunotherapies and could overcome treatment resistance. This is not just a new chapter—it's a whole new storyline in cancer research.""

Dr. Chen Qiu, corresponding author of the study

Therapeutic strategies that focus on senescent macrophages could play a transformative role in future cancer care. These aging cells are implicated in immune evasion and resistance to checkpoint inhibitors and chemotherapy. Combining senolytic or senomorphic treatments with standard therapies may enhance response rates and reduce recurrence. However, challenges remain: current biomarkers lack specificity, and senescent cells vary widely by tissue type. The review calls formulti-omics profilingand precision targeting to overcome these hurdles. As researchers decode the biology of aging within tumors, senescent macrophages may emerge not just as obstacles—but as strategic targets to tip the balance in favor of patients.

Vapourtec's LED module, designed to complement their continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR), enhances the potential of flow photochemistry and increases the scope for novel reactions.

The module enables reagentless reactions even when solids are present. This is achieved by using CSTRs. Each LED module has an input power of 70 W and delivers a radiant power up to 40 W. It is dimmable in the range 10% to 100% of maximum power with wavelengths from 365 nm and 700 nm available for photochemical CSTR.

Using a CSTR for photochemical reactions improves the handling of solids and enables the use of solid catalysts, solid stoichiometric reagents or the delivery of reactions that produce either solid products or solid by-products.

The photochemical CSTR is designed to be operated as a cascade thereby enabling continuous flow reactions to have well controlled residence time distribution.

The use of two Vapourtec R4 reactor heaters allows a photochemical CSTR cascade of up to eight reactors within an R-Series flow chemistry system, providing the perfect platform for the scaling-up of photochemical reactions, even when a mix of solids and liquids are involved.

The potential for exploring novel chemical space is increased by allowing the use of solid catalysis or by enabling reactions that generate solid products or solid by-products. In addition, the CSTR allows the removal of gaseous reaction products.""

Scientists uncover how shifts in gut fungi, shaped by genes and diet, may influence disease severity in people with multiple sclerosis, paving the way for new microbiome-based treatments.

Study: Exploring the mycobiota in multiple sclerosis: its influence on disease development and progression. Image credit: Troyan/Shutterstock.com

A new study published in Frontiers in Immunology revealed that the fungal component of human gut microbiota is associated with and may influence the development and progression of multiple sclerosis, a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system.  

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that develops when the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the protective covering of nerve fibers (myelin sheath) in the brain. This leads to inflammation, nerve damage, and disrupted communication between the brain and the rest of the body.

Genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors contribute significantly to the development and progression of MS. Recent evidence also links the immune-modulatory role of human gut microbiota with MS pathogenesis. Although most studies have particularly investigated the role of the gut bacterial community in MS, some recent evidence has highlighted the involvement of the gut fungal community (mycobiota).

In patients with MS, an increased abundance of antibodies specific to Candida albicans has been observed. Candida albicans is the most common fungal member of the gut microbiota, mostly harmless when present in low abundance. The specific enzyme activity of Candida albicans has also been correlated with disease severity.

Given the potential involvement of mycobiota in MS pathogenesis, the current study investigated the composition of the gut mycobiota in MS patients across different treatment conditions and disease stages. The primary aim was to decode potential associations between gut fungal communities, immune function, and genetic risk factors in MS.

The study involved 50 patients with MS and 25 healthy individuals as controls. Fecal and blood samples were collected from participants for the mycobiota characterization and risk factor analysis.

Two inflammatory risk factors, calprotectin and chitotriosidase, and the strongest genetic risk factor, the HLA-DRB1*15 variant, were analyzed. Chitotriosidase, an important biomarker of MS, has been linked to fungi in the cerebrospinal fluid derived from MS patients. Calprotectin is another important biomarker with strong antimicrobial activity against fungi.

The HLA-DRB1*15 gene variant is the most substantial risk factor for MS, playing a critical role in regulating T cell-mediated and antibody-mediated immune responses. The specific variants HLA-DRB1*1501 and HLA-DRB1*1503, which confer the most significant predisposition to MS, have been linked to an increased incidence of fungal infections.

The participants also completed a food frequency questionnaire to assess the impact of dietary components on fungal populations. 

The study findings revealed a trend toward greater fungal abundance and diversity in MS patients compared to healthy individuals, although differences were not statistically significant for overall diversity measures. Specific fungal genera, including Saccharomyces, Torulaspora, and Malassezia, showed notable patterns in the dataset. Still, Torulaspora and Debaryomyces were more characteristic of untreated MS patients, while Saccharomyces was more typical of controls.

The study found a strong association between the mycobiota profile of MS patients and the MS genetic risk factor HLA-DRB1*15 variants, with carriers of the HLA-DRB1*1501 variant exhibiting a higher risk of developing severe MS. Specifically, patients carrying the HLA-DRB1*1501 variant had higher abundances of the Debaryomyces and Talaromyces genera. In contrast, non-carriers exhibited higher abundances of the genus Cladosporium.

Regarding MS biomarkers, the study found disease-specific correlations between some fungal groups and blood levels of calprotectin and chitotriosidase, but group-level biomarker differences were generally insignificant. For example, chitotriosidase levels increased with age in MS patients. They tended to be higher in untreated patients with a worse prognosis, while calprotectin levels were found to influence mycobiota composition but did not significantly differ between patients and controls.

Regarding the impact of dietary habits, the study found significantly higher cholesterol consumption in MS patients compared to that in healthy individuals. This increased cholesterol intake was associated with distinct changes in gut mycobiota composition, highlighting altered lipid metabolism in MS.

The study provides new insights into the changes in gut fungal populations that may accompany MS pathogenesis and progression. The findings about associations between fungal biomarkers, genetic risk factors, and dietary habits would help better understand MS pathogenesis and support the development of potential mycobiota-targeted therapy.

The study identified Malassezia as a fungal genus correlated with greater MS severity and disability, though overall mycobiome diversity (Shannon index) predicted severity more strongly than any single genus. Malassezia has a high affinity for lipids in the brain, together with immune suppression and blood-brain barrier disruption in MS, which may facilitate the entry of Malassezia into the brain and subsequent disease progression.

Overall, the study findings on significant associations between specific fungal populations and disease severity highlight the importance of considering gut fungal dynamics in MS pathology. Since the fungal and bacterial populations are closely interconnected, and changes in one population can reciprocally influence the other, it is vital to consider the entire gut microbiota as an integrated ecosystem rather than focusing on a single kingdom to better understand MS pathogenesis.

This study sets the groundwork for the systematic characterization of minority microbial communities, such as fungi, within the broader microbiome landscape, highlighting the potential role of gut mycobiota as a biomarker or therapeutic target in future MS research rather than as an established causal factor.

A sweeping evidence map finds that while most dairy foods don't harm and may help your health, yogurt and fermented dairy top the charts for reducing the risk of major diseases.

Review: Association between dairy intake and multiple health outcomes: a scoping review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Image Credit: LADO / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition, a group of researchers summarized the relationship between different dairy foods and major health outcomes in adults, charting evidence from systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) published since 2014.

This comprehensive scoping review mapped the available evidence, integrating both observational studies and randomized controlled trials, to clarify the relationship between dairy intake and a broad range of health outcomes.

Fermented dairy's hidden perks: Beyond basic nutrition, components like probiotics in yogurt and kefir may offer extra benefits for gut health and immunity, though the exact mechanisms need more study.

Two to three dairy servings a day are commonly recommended to meet protein and micronutrient needs, yet many people fall short. Meanwhile, chronic diseases continue to rise, and news headlines often send mixed signals about milk, yogurt, and cheese. For everyday choices, from the grocery aisle to lunch at work, people want clarity.

Prior evidence suggests potential benefits, but concerns about saturated fat persist. Given dairy's long history in the human diet and its central place in food guidelines, it is timely to re-map the full evidence landscape across multiple health outcomes.

Previous research has often focused on specific products, age groups, or health markers, leaving gaps in understanding the broader impacts of dairy consumption. Further research is needed to clarify the product-specific effects and identify the populations most likely to benefit.

Your milk's origin matters: Dairy products vary widely by region due to farming practices and mandatory vitamin D fortification in some countries – factors most studies overlooked.

The protocol was registered on the Open Science Framework (OSF) on February 19, 2024, and the review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). A systematic search (February 19, 2024) covered Ovid Embase, Ovid Medline, and Web of Science, limited to SRs and/or MAs in English, German, French, or Spanish. Reports from the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) were added.

Eligibility was set using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Population-Concept-Context framework. Included were SRs/MAs (2014–February 19, 2024) based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective cohort studies, case–control studies, and cross-sectional studies in mostly adults; exposures included cow's milk and other dairy foods. Outcomes spanned cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke, hypertension, coronary heart disease (CHD), cancers (e.g., bladder, breast, colorectal, ovarian, prostate, gastric), body composition, all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), bone and joint health, and cognitive outcomes.

Study management used Zotero and Rayyan for de-duplication and dual review screening. Data extraction (pre-tested template) was conducted using Elicit software, with details checked and refined by reviewers.

It is worth noting that studies involving children, non-bovine dairy products, and fortified or supplemental dairy products were excluded, and many reviews did not provide details on regional differences or vitamin D fortification.

Cheese puzzles scientists: Despite being high in saturated fat and sodium, pooled research surprisingly didn't show cheese boosting heart disease risk, challenging simple dietary assumptions.

In the study, 95 reports mapped associations between five dairy exposure categories and 29 outcomes. Across 281 associations, 37.7% suggested reduced risk, 48.0% no association, 10.0% were inconclusive, and 4.3% suggested increased risk. Category coverage was total dairy (n = 66 reports), milk (n = 52), cheese (n = 43), yogurt (n = 40), and fermented dairy (n = 13).

Most associations for total dairy were neutral or protective across CVD, CHD, stroke, and hypertension; exceptions appeared for cardiovascular mortality. Reduced risks were also charted for bladder, breast, colorectal, and oral cancers, overweight/obesity, T2DM, and some joint outcomes. A few reports linked total dairy with a higher risk of liver, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, ovarian, prostate, and gastric cancers. For readers, this means that usual mixed dairy patterns are generally not associated with higher chronic disease risk and may provide modest protection in several domains.

Across outcomes, milk often showed reduced or neutral associations for CVD outcomes, with some heterogeneity. Milk intake was linked to a lower risk of oral, bladder, and colorectal cancers in several reports; however, a few analyses associated milk with a higher risk of breast, prostate, liver, or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Body weight evidence was sparse but suggested a lower risk of overweight/obesity. Mortality findings were mixed (mostly neutral or inconclusive). For everyday practice, plain milk appears broadly neutral to modestly favorable, with caution that some cancer findings conflict across studies.

Cheese showed heterogeneous results: several reports linked it to a lower incidence of CVD and a reduced risk for selected cancers (breast, colorectal, oral, and ovarian), while others were neutral; however, one report found an increased risk for prostate cancer. Mortality associations were generally neutral; findings for T2DM were mixed. The variability in results for cheese may reflect differences in composition and study definitions.

Yogurt stood out, as no associations suggesting harm were found. Multiple reports have linked yogurt to lower risks of bladder, breast, colorectal, esophageal, liver, and oral cancers, as well as reduced risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and lower all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, with some neutral findings. For consumers, swapping a daily snack for yogurt could be a simple, potentially beneficial choice.

When fermented foods (e.g., yogurt, cultured/sour milk, some cheeses) were grouped, evidence suggested reduced risk of CVD, stroke, several cancers (bladder, breast, esophageal), T2DM, and all-cause mortality, with neutral findings for colorectal cancer in some reports and a single report noting an increased all-cause mortality association.

Liver cancer's confusing dairy link: While overall cancer findings were often positive, evidence for dairy and liver cancer was mixed, with some analyses suggesting increased risk and others finding protection.

Sub-analyses comparing full-fat vs. reduced-fat dairy mostly found no differential harm; in fact, inverse associations appeared for several cardiovascular outcomes with both full- and reduced-fat dairy. Notable exceptions included full-fat milk being linked to a higher risk in a few stroke analyses, and ovarian cancer showing an increased association with full-fat milk but an inverse association with reduced-fat milk in one report. Mortality differences by fat level were essentially null, with isolated exceptions.

The authors highlight that many systematic reviews and meta-analyses included overlapping populations, which may have inflated the apparent associations for specific outcomes. In addition, only about half of the reports stratified results by sex, limiting insight into potential differences between men and women.

Another limitation noted is the lack of standardization in dairy product definitions, which vary by country, processing, and composition, making direct comparisons challenging. Furthermore, bone health outcomes in adults were under-represented, as most research has focused on calcium supplementation or pediatric populations rather than regular dairy intake in adults.

To summarize, across SRs and MAs, dairy consumption is generally neutral or modestly protective for major noncommunicable outcomes, with yogurt and other fermented dairy showing the most consistent associations with lower risks—an actionable insight for daily eating patterns. Variation across products (especially cheese types) and some cancer signals (e.g., prostate, ovarian) call for nuance rather than one-size-fits-all advice. Future work should deepen product-specific analyses (particularly for fermented dairy) and clarify when fat content matters, so that individuals and public health programs can tailor guidance to maximize benefits while monitoring potential risks.

The authors recommend that future research should improve dietary assessment methods (e.g., using repeated food frequency questionnaires) and clarify the role of fortified versus non-fortified products to better inform nutritional guidelines.

Could your daily coffee or tea habit help keep your mind sharp as you age? New research links moderate consumption to slower declines in reasoning and memory among seniors.

Study: Moderate coffee and tea consumption is associated with slower cognitive decline. Image Credit: Ljupco Smokovski / Shutterstock

In a recent article published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, researchers investigated the association between different levels of tea and coffee consumption and long-term changes in cognitive performance among older adults. Their results indicated that moderate coffee intake, as well as moderate to high tea intake, may be linked to slower cognitive decline, and that moderate coffee intake may be more beneficial than high intake.

Cognitive decline, especially due to Alzheimer's disease, is a major public health issue in aging populations. Identifying modifiable lifestyle factors that help preserve cognitive function is, therefore, critical. Coffee and tea, both widely consumed beverages, contain compounds such as caffeine, flavonoids, and other polyphenols that may promote brain health through anti-inflammatory and antioxidant mechanisms. The paper notes that coffee also contains chlorogenic acids, while tea contains theanine and specific flavonoids, such as catechins.

Prior meta-analyses have suggested mixed but promising results. One study found that consuming up to 2.5 cups of coffee per day was linked to a lower risk of cognitive disorders, while for tea, a linear relationship was observed, where each additional daily cup was associated with an 11% reduction in risk.

Another meta-analysis suggested that low intake of coffee and green tea was protective against cognitive decline and dementia. However, human studies on this topic have shown inconsistent results, possibly due to differences in study design, confounding variables, and unclear dose-response relationships.

Researchers accounted for genetic risk: The study specifically controlled for whether participants carried the APOE-ε4 gene, a major known genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, strengthening the link between beverage habits and cognitive change.

In this study, researchers analyzed data from 8,715 participants in the UK aged 60–85 years who were dementia-free at baseline and followed over an average of 9.11 years. Participants were excluded if they had medical conditions or were on medications that could affect cognitive health, such as Parkinson's, depression, diabetes, hypertension, or were consuming more than 14 units of alcohol per week.

Coffee and tea intake over the previous year was self-reported and categorized into three groups: never, moderate intake (between one and three cups per day), or high intake (more than four cups per day). Cognitive function was assessed using computerized tests measuring fluid intelligence (the ability to solve verbal and numeric reasoning problems), reaction time, numeric memory, and pair-matching errors (a test of visual memory).

Demographic and genetic data, including socioeconomic status, body mass index (BMI), ethnicity, education, age, sex, and Apolipoprotein E genotype, were recorded and controlled for in the analysis. Cognitive changes were assessed using linear mixed models, including time as an interaction variable. Data were adjusted for key covariates and corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR). Skewed cognitive variables were transformed for normality.

Participants were required to undergo at least two cognitive assessments during the study period. By excluding reports of extreme beverage consumption and controlling for confounders, the study aimed to isolate the effects of moderate and high coffee and tea intake on cognitive aging.

Oddly, tea drinkers started slightly lower: Despite showing slower decline over time, individuals who consumed tea actually scored a bit worse on fluid intelligence tests right at the study's beginning, even after considering other factors like age and education.

The study found that daily coffee and tea intake predicted changes in cognitive performance over time, particularly in fluid intelligence. Participants who reported never drinking coffee or moderate coffee consumption experienced a slower decline in fluid intelligence compared to those with high coffee intake. These groups also exhibited a smaller increase in pair-matching errors, indicating better preservation of visual memory over time. However, no significant associations were observed between coffee intake and reaction time or numeric memory.

For tea, both moderate and high intake were linked to a slower decline in fluid intelligence compared to those who never consumed tea. These associations remained statistically significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. However, at baseline, those who drank tea performed slightly worse on the fluid intelligence task. Tea intake was not associated with changes in reaction time, pair-matching errors, or numerical memory across the follow-up period.

Overall, moderate coffee and tea intake appeared to protect against certain forms of cognitive decline in older adults, particularly in reasoning and problem-solving abilities. In contrast, high coffee consumption (four or more cups daily) was associated with a faster decline.

This study showed that moderate coffee and both moderate and high tea intake were associated with slower declines in fluid intelligence over nearly a decade, suggesting potential cognitive benefits in older age. While the protective effects were more apparent for tea and moderate coffee intake, high coffee consumption (four or more cups per day) was linked to poorer outcomes.

These findings align with some prior research but contrast with studies using global cognitive measures or shorter assessments.

Caffeine might explain the tea/coffee difference: The paper suggests tea's lower caffeine content per cup (roughly 28-45mg vs. coffee's 95mg) could be why high tea intake remained protective while high coffee intake was linked to faster decline.

Strengths include the large, well-characterized sample and long follow-up duration. However, limitations include self-reported beverage intake (subject to recall bias), lack of data on mid-life consumption or coffee preparation methods (such as decaffeinated vs. caffeinated, brewing method, or the addition of milk and sugar), or the specific types of tea consumed (e.g., black, green, or white).

Additionally, potential confounding factors, such as stress or sleep disruption, may not have been fully accounted for.

Despite these limitations, the results suggest that moderate consumption of coffee and tea may be protective against age-related cognitive decline. The researchers speculate that caffeine may be a key factor, noting that tea's lower caffeine content could explain why no upper limit for beneficial tea consumption was observed in this study. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm causal relationships and inform guidelines.

UCSF researchers have found that certain antiviral genes become less active over time in lupus, revealing why some patients see their symptoms fade as they age.

Lupus is a ""classic"" autoimmune disease. 

It causes the immune system's first-line viral defenses - known as interferons - to attack the body. Nearly every organ is at risk, leading to conditions like kidney and heart disease. 

But unlike many other autoimmune or chronic illnesses, lupus can improve as patients reach their 60s and 70s. 

I see my younger lupus patients in their 20s, 30s, and 40s every few months, monitoring them closely for signs of severe disease, but many of my older patients just once a year to touch base. If patients make it through those risky decades, they sometimes see a dramatic improvement.""

Sarah Patterson, MD, Assistant Professor, Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, University of California - San Francisco

Now, Patterson and colleagues have published a study in ScienceTranslational Medicine that reveals how this works. 

By analyzing blood samples from patients across the age spectrum, the team discovered that aging turns down the activity of certain immune genes in people with lupus, leading to fewer interferons and other inflammatory proteins in the body.

The study found that in healthy adults, inflammation-related genes and proteins rose slowly over the years, a process that has been dubbed ""inflammaging."" In patients with lupus, however, the expression of these genes and proteins were abnormally high in mid-life but decreased as the decades went by. 

""Inflammaging seemed to be reversed in the lupus patients,"" said Chaz Langelier, MD, PhD, associate professor of medicine at UCSF and senior author of the paper. ""But it wasn't fully reversed. The lupus patients still had a greater level of inflammatory signaling compared to healthy adults in older age.""

That reversal reflected what Patterson has seen in her patients - a return to something approaching healthy older age. 

Next, the team intends to test whether drugs that block interferons are more or less effective in lupus patients at different ages. They also hope to extend the approach to understand other inflammation-related conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, COPD, and atherosclerosis.

Exonate Ltd., a biotechnology company developing novel, non-invasive, small-molecule therapeutics for patients with retinal vascular diseases, today announced plans to initiate a Phase IIb clinical trial for its lead candidate EXN407. The CLEAR-DE (Clinical Evaluation of a New Eye Drop for Alleviating Retinopathy in Diabetic Eye Disease) trial will further evaluate the clinical efficacy, optimal dosing and safety profile of EXN407 in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR).

The progression to a Phase IIb clinical study follows encouraging results from Exonate's Phase Ib/IIa study in March 2024. In the study, lead candidate EXN407 met its primary safety and tolerability endpoints, with no drug-related serious adverse events, and high patient compliance. Importantly, exploratory efficacy signals showed a reduction in vascular leakage, a key pathological driver in diabetic retinopathy. The Phase IIb trial to investigate the efficacy of EXN407 in NPDR patients is planned to begin in early 2026, with 140 patients currently enrolled across multiple sites in Australia, the Middle East and China.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss globally. An estimated one-third of the nearly 500 million people living with diabetes are affected by NPDR, the early stage of diabetic eye disease, which can lead to more severe, vision-threatening complications. Current therapeutic approaches involve monthly intraocular injections, initiated only after symptoms appear. This limits opportunities for early therapeutic benefit, and due to the invasive nature and frequency, is often deferred until irreversible damage has occurred.

EXN407 is a first-in-class, twice-daily topical formulation of a selective SRPK1 inhibitor - a minimally-invasive approach with potential to become the first effective eye-drop therapy for NPDR and diabetic macular oedema (DME). Designed to modulate expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) via alternative mRNA splicing, EXN407 selectively inhibits the pro-angiogenic isoforms that drive disease progression, causing abnormal and leaky blood vessel formation in the retina.

The Phase Ib/IIa data demonstrated the clear potential of EXN407 as a non-invasive treatment for diabetic eye disease.

This therapy could transform the treatment landscape for early-stage disease by providing clinical benefit while avoiding the burden of injections, representing a significant advancement for patients and physicians alike. We're excited to progress to the CLEAR-DE Phase IIb trial and are actively seeking strategic partners to support its execution.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Mexican neuroscientist's journey from exile to schizophrenia research breakthroughs","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250729/Mexican-neuroscientists-journey-from-exile-to-schizophrenia-research-breakthroughs.aspx","Tue, 29 Jul 2025 10:47:00 GMT","

In a revealing Genomic Press Interview published today in Brain Medicine, Dr. Camilo de la Fuente-Sandoval shares how personal history and scientific passion converged to create groundbreaking advances in schizophrenia treatment prediction. The distinguished neuroscientist, recently honored with the Schizophrenia International Research Society's prestigious 2024 Global Schizophrenia Award, has established a unique research paradigm that combines cutting-edge neuroimaging with comprehensive clinical care in one of Latin America's most populous urban centers.

The journey that led Dr. de la Fuente-Sandoval to become a leading voice in psychosis research began with displacement. His father, a researcher forced to flee Chile for political reasons, saw his scientific career abruptly terminated. This family history of interrupted scientific pursuit became a driving force that would later shape the younger de la Fuente-Sandoval's determination to build something lasting in neuroscience research.

During his psychiatry residency at the Instituto Nacional de Neurología y Neurocirugía, patients experiencing psychosis captivated his attention. Guided by fellow resident Ariel Graff-Guerrero, who had completed advanced neuroscience training, Dr. de la Fuente-Sandoval embarked on spectroscopy studies that would fundamentally alter understanding of early psychosis mechanisms. These initial investigations in both clinical high-risk subjects and first-episode psychosis patients revealed neurochemical alterations that had previously remained hidden from clinical observation.

The success of these early studies prompted institutional leadership to offer him laboratory space, catalyzing the creation of what would become the Laboratory of Experimental Psychiatry. This opportunity sparked an ambitious vision: developing imaging markers that could guide treatment selection rather than relying on the traditional trial-and-error approach that often delays effective intervention in young people experiencing their first psychotic episodes.

Operating within Mexico City's sprawling metropolitan area of 22 million residents, where mental health resources remain severely limited, Dr. de la Fuente-Sandoval has engineered an innovative clinical research ecosystem. His team established a specialized outpatient clinic staffed by laboratory-affiliated psychiatrists while simultaneously implementing comprehensive evaluation protocols in the emergency department.

This integrated approach ensures that first-episode psychosis patients receive immediate, thorough assessment including routine laboratory tests, head CT scans, and selective lumbar punctures based on clinical judgment. Remarkably, approximately 8% of patients presenting with first-episode psychosis are discovered to have secondary causes such as viral encephalitis or autoimmune conditions. Could this systematic screening approach, if implemented more broadly, prevent misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment in similar patient populations worldwide?

All patients undergo comprehensive evaluation within 24 hours of emergency admission, including neuropsychological testing and MRI studies. This rapid assessment protocol serves dual purposes: enabling immediate treatment initiation while generating crucial research data. The entire process occurs at no cost to patients, addressing both scientific questions and healthcare access barriers simultaneously.

The laboratory's most significant contribution centers on discoveries about glutamate dysfunction in early psychosis. Through sophisticated MRI spectroscopy techniques applied to antipsychotic-naïve patients, Dr. de la Fuente-Sandoval's team identified elevated glutamate levels specifically within the associative striatum. More importantly, they demonstrated that these elevations normalize following effective antipsychotic treatment.

This finding opens unprecedented possibilities for treatment personalization. Rather than subjecting patients to potentially ineffective medications for weeks or months, clinicians might soon predict treatment response through baseline neuroimaging assessments. What implications might this hold for reducing the duration of untreated psychosis, a factor strongly associated with long-term outcomes? The potential to match patients with optimal treatments from the outset represents a paradigm shift in psychiatric care delivery.

The research extends beyond glutamate to encompass electrophysiology, cognitive assessment, and inflammation markers. This multidimensional approach recognizes psychosis as a complex phenomenon requiring equally sophisticated investigative strategies. By integrating multiple biological markers, the laboratory works toward comprehensive predictive models that could transform clinical decision-making.

Despite geographic and resource constraints, Dr. de la Fuente-Sandoval has positioned his laboratory at the forefront of international schizophrenia research. His leadership role in the ENIGMA Clinical High Risk for Psychosis Working Group facilitates data sharing and collaborative analyses across continents. This participation ensures that findings from Latin American populations contribute to global understanding of psychosis mechanisms.

The laboratory's success challenges assumptions about where cutting-edge neuroscience can flourish. By leveraging Mexico City's large patient population and combining it with rigorous scientific methodology, the team generates insights unavailable in better-resourced but smaller research settings. How might other investigators in resource-limited environments replicate this model of turning apparent disadvantages into scientific opportunities?

Dr. de la Fuente-Sandoval's Genomic Press interview is part of a larger series called Innovators & Ideas that highlights the people behind today's most influential scientific breakthroughs. Each interview in the series offers a blend of cutting-edge research and personal reflections, providing readers with a comprehensive view of the scientists shaping the future. By combining a focus on professional achievements with personal insights, this interview style invites a richer narrative that both engages and educates readers. This format provides an ideal starting point for profiles that explore the scientist's impact on the field, while also touching on broader human themes.

Childhood brain tumor survival depends on the type of tumor. Comparing survival rates across countries is difficult, because brain tumors aren't recorded in the same way everywhere in Europe. A new study led by the Princess Máxima Center is helping to change that. For the first time, the research provides a clear and clinically relevant overview of survival outcomes for children with brain tumors.

Researchers at the Princess Máxima Center analyzed data from more than 30,000 children diagnosed with a brain tumor between 1998 and 2013. The data came from 80 cancer registries across 31 European countries. The study was published today in the leading medical journal The Lancet Oncology.

The study focuses on the four most common types of brain tumors in children: low-grade gliomas, high-grade gliomas, ependymomas, and medulloblastomas. The researchers looked at both short- and long-term survival, as well as the proportion of children considered cured. They used a new classification system that better reflects how doctors diagnose and treat brain tumors in practice.

'For this study, we restructured the tumor categories in the cancer registries to match how tumors are diagnosed today,' explains Dr. Raoull Hoogendijk, who worked on the study as part of his PhD research in the Karim-Kos and Van Vuurden research groups at the Máxima. 'That means the numbers now align much better with clinical reality, and doctors can use them more effectively to compare outcomes.'

One key finding is that differences in survival between countries are smaller than previously thought. This suggests that children across Europe generally have access to similar treatments. Between 1998 and 2013, survival rates for children with brain tumors in the Netherlands were about average compared to other European countries-offering both reassurance and direction for further improvement.

'This study shows us where we stand in Europe, and where there's room to grow,' says Dr. Henrike Karim-Kos, research group leader at the Máxima and the Netherlands Comprehensive Cancer Organisation (IKNL), and coordinator of the study. 'For policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers, this overview provides valuable insights to improve care and data registration. Together, we can work toward better outcomes for children with cancer.'

For the first time, the study also maps out how many children can be considered cured. These insights help doctors and researchers refine treatments-with the ultimate goal of curing all children with cancer, while preserving their quality of life.

Prof. Eelco Hoving, Clinical Director of Neuro-oncology and pediatric neurosurgeon who also worked on the study, adds: 'This study shows that survival rates for children with brain tumors have improved over the past 15 years. But survival for children with high-grade gliomas remains far too low. Our findings highlight the urgent need for better treatments for these-and all-children with brain tumors.'

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Changing the narrative on hormone-related mood disorders in women","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250729/Changing-the-narrative-on-hormone-related-mood-disorders-in-women.aspx","Tue, 29 Jul 2025 10:54:00 GMT","

In a wide-ranging Genomic Press Interview published today in Brain Medicine, Dr. David R. Rubinow recounts the serendipitous path that led him to overturn decades of medical assumptions about hormone-related mood disorders in women.

The interview reveals how a chance phone call accepting a fellowship position he had initially rejected set Dr. Rubinow on a trajectory that would fundamentally change how medicine understands and treats reproductive mood disorders. His discovery that women with conditions like premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), postpartum depression, and perimenopausal depression have completely normal hormone levels challenged the prevailing wisdom of an entire field.

""I called him right back and said that I would be grateful to accept his invitation,"" Dr. Rubinow recalls of the moment that changed his career trajectory. That decision to work with Dr. Bob Post at the National Institute of Mental Health launched a 27-year career at NIH that would validate the experiences of millions of women whose hormone-related mood symptoms had been dismissed or misunderstood.

Through meticulous research involving blinded hormone manipulation studies, Dr. Rubinow and colleague Dr. Peter Schmidt identified what they termed ""differential sensitivity"" – the phenomenon where susceptible women respond differently to normal hormonal fluctuations. This breakthrough shifted treatment approaches from attempting to normalize hormone levels to targeting the abnormal response mechanisms themselves.

The practical impact of Dr. Rubinow's work materialized when his insights contributed to developing brexanolone (Zulresso), the first FDA-approved medication specifically for postpartum depression. Unlike traditional antidepressants, this neurosteroid treatment directly addresses the differential sensitivity mechanisms his research had uncovered.

In the interview, Dr. Rubinow shares how his background in philosophy and history unexpectedly prepared him for scientific discovery. ""What I enjoyed in those two areas were the discipline of questioning in philosophy and the opportunity for creative linking of ideas in history,"" he explains. This interdisciplinary thinking enabled him to identify novel connections that yielded significant physiological insights.

After establishing himself as a researcher, Dr. Rubinow brought his vision to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2006, serving as Chair of Psychiatry until 2019. During his tenure, he founded the UNC Center for Women's Mood Disorders, established (with Samantha Meltzer-Brody) the nation's first peripartum psychiatry inpatient unit, and created (with Susan Girdler) the first NIH-sponsored fellowship in women's mood disorders.

The interview also reveals Dr. Rubinow's parallel passions for music and woodworking, offering glimpses into the person behind the scientific achievements. His philosophy of ""bringing the chisel when sent for the hammer"" – inherited from his grandfather – reflects the thoughtful, comprehensive approach that characterized his research career.

A member of the National Academy of Medicine since 2012 and past president of both the Society of Biological Psychiatry and the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology, Dr. Rubinow has authored over 400 scientific publications. Yet in the interview, he attributes much of his success to serendipity and being open to unexpected opportunities.

His work has particular relevance as awareness of women's mental health continues to grow. By establishing reproductive psychiatry as a legitimate subspecialty with evidence-based treatments, Dr. Rubinow's research has provided hope and validation for women whose experiences were previously marginalized in medical settings.

Dr. David R. Rubinow's Genomic Press interview is part of a larger series called Innovators & Ideas that highlights the people behind today's most influential scientific breakthroughs. Each interview in the series offers a blend of cutting-edge research and personal reflections, providing readers with a comprehensive view of the scientists shaping the future. By combining a focus on professional achievements with personal insights, this interview style invites a richer narrative that both engages and educates readers. This format provides an ideal starting point for profiles that explore the scientist's impact on the field, while also touching on broader human themes.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","A brain-dead pregnant woman was kept alive in Georgia. It's unclear if state law required it.","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250729/A-brain-dead-pregnant-woman-was-kept-alive-in-Georgia-Ite28099s-unclear-if-state-law-required-it.aspx","Tue, 29 Jul 2025 10:36:00 GMT","

A Georgia woman declared brain-dead and kept on life support for more than three months because she was pregnant was removed from a ventilator in June and died, days after doctors delivered her 1-pound, 13-ounce baby by emergency cesarean section. The baby is in the neonatal intensive care unit.

The case has drawn national attention to Georgia's six-week abortion ban and its impacts on pregnancy care.

Adriana Smith was put on life support at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta in February. The then-30-year-old Atlanta nurse was more than eight weeks pregnant and suffering dangerous complications.

Her condition deteriorated as doctors tried to save her life, Smith's mother told Atlanta TV station WXIA.

""They did a CT scan, and she had blood clots all in her head,"" April Newkirk said. ""So they had asked me if they could do a procedure to relieve them, and I said yes. And then they called me back and they said that they couldn't do it.""

She said doctors declared Smith brain-dead and put her on life support without consulting her.

""And I'm not saying that we would have chose to terminate her pregnancy,"" Newkirk said, ""but what I'm saying is, we should have had a choice.""

Emory Healthcare declined to comment on the specifics of Smith's case. After doctors removed Smith from life support, Emory issued a statement.

""The top priorities at Emory Healthcare continue to be the safety and wellbeing of the patients and families we serve,"" the health system said. ""Emory Healthcare uses consensus from clinical experts, medical literature and legal guidance to support our providers as they make medical recommendations. Emory Healthcare is legally required to maintain the confidentiality of the protected health information of our patients, which is why we are unable to comment on individual matters and circumstances.""

In a previous statement, Emory Healthcare said it complies ""with Georgia's abortion laws and all other applicable laws.""

Georgia's HB 481 — the Living Infants Fairness and Equality, or LIFE, Act — passed in 2019. It took effect shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade with its ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization on June 24, 2022.

The law bans abortion after the point at which an ultrasound can detect cardiac activity in an embryo. Typically, this occurs about six weeks into pregnancy, often before women know they're pregnant.

The law also gave fetuses the same rights as people.

It says that ""unborn children are a class of living, distinct persons"" and that the state of Georgia ""recognizes the benefits of providing full legal recognition to an unborn child.""

Nineteen states now ban abortion at or before 19 weeks of gestation; 13 of those have a near-total ban on all abortions with very limited exceptions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a nonpartisan research group that supports abortion rights.

Like Georgia, some of these states built their abortion restrictions around the legal concept of ""personhood,"" thus conferring legal rights and protections on an embryo or fetus during pregnancy.

Smith's case has represented a major test of how this type of law will be applied in certain medical situations.

Despite mainly being unified in their opposition to abortion, conservatives and politicians in Georgia do not publicly agree on the scope of the law in cases like Smith's.

For example, Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, a Republican, said that the law should not restrict the options for care in a case like Smith's and that removing life support wouldn't be equivalent to aborting a fetus.

""There is nothing in the LIFE Act that requires medical professionals to keep a woman on life support after brain death,"" Carr said in a statement. ""Removing life support is not an action 'with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy.'""

But Republican state Sen. Ed Setzler, who authored the LIFE Act, disagreed. Emory's doctors acted appropriately when they put Smith on life support, he told The Associated Press.

""I think it is completely appropriate that the hospital do what they can to save the life of the child,"" Setzler said. ""I think this is an unusual circumstance, but I think it highlights the value of innocent human life. I think the hospital is acting appropriately.""

Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California-Davis and author of ""Personhood: The New Civil War Over Reproduction,"" said the problem is that Georgia's law ""isn't just an abortion ban. It's a 'personhood' law declaring that a fetus or embryo is a person, that an 'unborn child,' as the law puts it, is a person.""

The legal concept of ""personhood"" has implications beyond abortion care, such as with the regulation of fertility treatment, or the potential criminalization of pregnancy complications such as stillbirth and miscarriage.

Under Georgia's law, extending rights of personhood to a fetus changes how child support is calculated. It also allows an embryo or fetus to be claimed as a dependent on state taxes.

But the idea of personhood is not new, Ziegler said.

""It has been the goal for virtually everyone in the anti-abortion movement since the 1960s,"" she said. ""That doesn't mean Republicans like that. It doesn't necessarily mean that that's what's going to happen. But there is no daylight between the anti-abortion movement and the personhood movement. They're the same.""

The personhood movement has gained more traction since the Dobbs ruling in 2022.

In Alabama, after the state's Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos are people, the state legislature had to step in to allow fertility clinics to continue their work.

""This is sort of the future we're looking at if we move further in the direction of fetal personhood,"" Ziegler said. ""Any state Supreme Court, as we just saw in Alabama, can give them new life,"" she said referring to personhood laws elsewhere.

In Georgia, dozens of OB-GYNs have said that the law interferes with patient care — in a state where the maternal mortality rate is one of the worst in the U.S. and where Black women are more than twice as likely to die from a pregnancy-related cause than white women. 

Members of Georgia's Maternal Mortality Review Committee — who were later dismissed from the panel — linked the state's abortion ban to delayed emergency care and the deaths of at least two women in the state, as ProPublica reported.

The personhood provision is having a profound effect on medical care, said Atlanta OB-GYN Zoë Lucier-Julian.

""These laws create an environment of fear and attempt to coerce us as providers to align with the state, as opposed to aligning with our patients that we work so hard to serve,"" Lucier-Julian said.

Lucier-Julian said that's what happened to Emory Healthcare in Smith's case.

Cole Muzio, president of the Frontline Policy Council, a conservative Christian group, said the state's abortion law shouldn't have affected how Emory handled Smith's care.

""This is a pretty clear-cut case, in terms of how it's defined in the language of HB 481,"" he said. ""What this bans is an abortion after a heartbeat is detected. That is the scope of our law.""

""Taking a woman off life support is not an abortion. It just isn't,"" Muzio said.""Now, I am incredibly grateful that this child will be born even in the midst of tragic circumstances. That is a whole human life that will be able to be lived because of this beautiful mother's sacrifice.""

A suit challenging Georgia's law and its impact on public health is working its way through the courts. A coalition of physicians, the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia, Planned Parenthood, the Center for Reproductive Rights, and other groups filed the suit.

Newkirk said her daughter had initially gone to a different Atlanta-area hospital for help with severe headaches, was given some medicine, and was sent home, where her symptoms quickly worsened.

""She was gasping for air in her sleep, gargling,"" she told WXIA in May. ""More than likely, it was blood.""

Now, Newkirk said, the family is praying for her grandson to make it after the stress from months of life support. 

He is fighting, she said.

""My grandson may be blind, may not be able to walk, wheelchair-bound,"" she said. ""We don't know if he'll live.""

She added that the family will love him no matter what.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Fast walking for 15 minutes a day linked to lower death risk","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250729/Fast-walking-for-15-minutes-a-day-linked-to-lower-death-risk.aspx","Tue, 29 Jul 2025 17:31:00 GMT","

Walking fast for just 15 minutes per day reduced the risk of death in a large study group of mostly low-income participants.

The research findings, published July 29 in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, support promoting brisk walking as a strategy for improving health outcomes in all communities.

Although the health benefits of walking are widely recognized, there has been limited research on the effect of factors such as walking pace on mortality, particularly in low-income and Black populations, said the study's senior author, Wei Zheng, MD, PhD, MPH, the Anne Potter Wilson Professor of Medicine and director of the Vanderbilt Epidemiology Center.

""This is one of the few studies to quantify the effect of daily walking on mortality in a low-income and predominantly Black U.S. population,"" said Zheng, who also directs the Division of Epidemiology at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. ""By demonstrating the benefits of fast walking - which is a low-cost and largely accessible activity - we provide direct evidence to inform targeted public health interventions and policies to improve health outcomes.""

The study analyzed data from the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS), which enrolled about 85,000 participants ages 40-79 between 2002 and 2009. Most participants (86%) were recruited in collaboration with community health centers serving low-income populations across 12 southeastern states. Participants provided baseline information, including daily walking pace and time, demographic and lifestyle factors, and medical history, using structured questionnaires.

The current study, led by first author Lili Liu, PhD, MPH, included data from 79,856 of the SCCS participants (racial groups: 66% Black, 30% white, 4% other). In the baseline survey, participants reported the average amount of time per day (in minutes) they typically spend ""walking slowly (such as moving around, walking at work, walking the dog or engaging in light exercise)"" and ""walking fast (such as climbing stairs, brisk walking or exercising).""

The cohort was linked to the National Death Index to obtain vital status and cause of death information through Dec. 31, 2022. Over a median follow-up of 16.7 years, 26,862 deaths occurred.

The researchers found that fast walking as little as 15 minutes per day was associated with a nearly 20% reduction in total mortality. Slow walking more than three hours per day was associated with a smaller reduction in mortality. The benefit of fast walking remained strong even after accounting for other lifestyle factors, such as leisure-time physical activity levels.

In addition to reducing premature death from all causes, fast walking reduced death specifically from cardiovascular diseases - the No. 1 cause of death in the United States. The researchers suggested that fast walking might reduce cardiovascular mortality by improving the heart's efficiency and output, and by reducing the prevalence of obesity and its associated cardiovascular risks such as hypertension and high cholesterol.

Brisk walking offers a convenient, accessible and low-impact activity that individuals of all ages and fitness levels can use to improve general health and cardiovascular health specifically.""

Wei Zheng, MD, PhD, MPH, the Anne Potter Wilson Professor of Medicine and Director, Vanderbilt Epidemiology Center

The authors acknowledge that self-reported data on daily walking may have included other types of physical activity, which could introduce misclassification errors. Also, the physical activity data was only collected at baseline, so changes over time could not be considered. The study's long follow-up and large sample size contribute to ""robust and reliable estimates,"" they noted.

Other VUMC co-authors are Guochang Jia, PhD, Martha Shrubsole, PhD, Wanqing Wen, MD, MPH, and Staci Sudenga, PhD. The research was supported in part by the National Institutes of Health (grant U01CA202979).

As the summer international window closes and we say farewell to the 2025 UEFA Women's Euro, Women's Afcon, and the 2025 Copa America Femenina, it's time to crank up the heat on the build-up to the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup. The biggest women's tournament is set to take place in Brazil, and some nations have already secured their spots in their respective World Cup qualifying competitions, which are scheduled to begin later this year and conclude in 2026. 

England extended their reign over Europe during their comeback run throughout the 2025 Euro and are now two-time Euro champions, while 2023 World Cup champions Spain had to settle for runners-up. The Euros delivered endless goals in the group stage and high drama in the knockouts, with extra-time matches and penalty shootouts, including in the final, where Chloe Kelly scored the title-deciding penalty. The U.S. women's national team closed out their summer early, with a five-game win streak, pulling off victories against Canada, Ireland, Jamaica, and China.

While the United States, England, and Spain are likely to form a ""big three"" in the globe, when it comes to teams sneaking into the rankings, any team can challenge another. Nigeria reclaimed the title as Africa's best with their 10th Women's Afcon title over Morocco. Brazil has already qualified for the 2027 World Cup as host nation, but they're still on the hunt for another Copa America championship, but Uruguay, Colombia, and Argentina are hopeful to disrupt Brazil's run. 

The 2027 World Cup is 23 months away, and top national teams are locked into preparations for the long journey to Brazil. But where do they rank based on current form?

The most recent winners of a global tournament, the entire first half of the year has been a flex for the program to show how deep it is after the 2024 Olympic gold medal win. Head coach Emma Hayes has mastered roster pool expansion and refining team identity by prioritizing the players and the overall long-term program goals. The USWNT returned to global prominence with their top podium finish in Paris, and under Hayes, remain the gold standard for performance, attacking prowess, and now tactical ability. 

There's no denying the incredible efforts England made to build on their program's history. Back-to-back Euro champions is a near-impossible feat for most programs, but not for the Lionesses. They showed off another aspect of their program with resiliency under manager Sarina Wiegman, and a reminder that sometimes glory comes with a price, as defender Lucy Bronze played through a fractured tibia. 

The 2023 World Cup champions had to settle for runners-up at the Euro, but despite the penalty heartbreak, their technical brilliance led the march toward the final. They'll have a chance to make another statement during the upcoming UEFA Nations League, but their Euro performance showed once again they're a top side in the world. Their possession-based style with a midfield of maestros in Aitana Bonmati, Alexia Putellas, and Patri Guajirro will keep them elite. 

The 2027 World Cup hosts are on the rise following their silver medal finish at the 2024 Olympics. They handed the USWNT one of their two losses this year, and are currently dominating the Copa America. The group is building toward a home World Cup as Marta's presence is still a factor for the squad, and her legacy is inspiring a new generation of players. Manager Arthur Elias has his team competing with their signature flair, combined with defensive efforts. 

It was hurdle after hurdle for the squad during the Euros, but Germany's pedigree remains. They found a way to the semifinals thanks to goalkeeping heroics by Ann-Katrin Berger and fell short to eventual runners-up Spain. Although Lena Oberdorf has been sidelined as she works back from an ACL injury, Jule Brand, Klara Buhl, and Sjoeke Nüsken remain players to build the program around. 

Veteran Kosovare Asllani spoke up for her squad against critics and oddsmakers who underrated Sweden during the Euros, but unfortunately, the team squandered a two-goal lead in the quarterfinal against England, and they stay outside the top five of this ranking as well. Despite constantly being the obstacle in others' success stories, rather than having a trophy of their own, they're still a tough opponent who will remain a top-ten team with plenty of talent in the pipeline with Rosa Kafaji and Hanna Bennison.

The Nadeshiko delivered an early loss to the USWNT and won the 2025 SheBelieves Cup earlier this year. Their disciplined technicality on the ball makes them a challenging opponent to go up against, and their ability to share attacking responsibility offers a layer of unpredictability for defenders. They'll only get stronger as they integrate more youth to balance with veterans.

Head coach Laurent Bonadei made a statement with his roster choices ahead of the Euros, leaving off veterans Eugénie Le Sommer and Wendie Renard, and another quarterfinal exit for France will just mean more questions around the team's ability in high-stakes tournaments. Hard to count out a team with exciting attacking talents in Delphine Cascarino, Marie Antoinette Katoto, and Sandy Baltimore, but consistency against top teams in the knockout rounds remains elusive. 

A group that caused England plenty of anxiety and troubles during the 2023 World Cup, despite being owed back-pay and a lack of resources, marched right back to the top of the Women's Afcon tournament this year. More official, governing body-type rankings likely won't have an African nation in the top ten, but that's not the case here. There's no way we could leave Africa's powerhouse, the Super Falcons, off the list. Top of the kit rankings shouldn't be the only place where they feature, and after missing out on the Women's Afcon title in 2022, the group completed their ""Mission X"" for a tenth title. Imagine Rasheedat Ajibade and Asisat Oshoala, and Jennifer Echegini could do with more support. 

This team is sitting in last place and barely hanging on. They've got a hold because they have great players whose talents can determine the outcomes of games, and the federation managed to hire a solid coach in Casey Stoney to start the year. But the truth is they're a team that has somewhat regressed since their 2020 Tokyo Olympics gold medal run. Stoney was vocal about the ways the program and players fell short after their 2-0 loss against the USWNT in July, and the roster needs more support if they're to improve moving forward.

Italy: The roster showed significant evolution under head coach Andrea Soncin. They defied expectations during the Euro with a mix of tactical awareness and key players stepping up as they bowed out of the semifinals against eventual tournament winners England. If they can work on defensive lapses and build on their tactics, they could leap into the top ten.

Colombia: Las Chicas Superpoderosas aren't some imitation Powerpuff Girls, but a group who have emerged as bona fide continental figures for South America. They're currently on the hunt to take Brazil's crown in the Copa America, and with Chelsea FC's Mayra Ramirez and Real Madrid's Linda Caicedo, they could rival the crown and leap into our rankings.

Netherlands: The Dutch look like an evaporating version of their 2017 Euro championship run. The roster struggled with its group of death draw in the Euro, now their early elimination means the federation needs to get the next coaching hire right, as they'll have to tackle questions around an aging squad and how to rejuvenate the team in the build-up to the 2027 World Cup, a full decade from their historic Euro title-run.

Nathaniel Brown may not be closing the door entirely on representing the U.S. men's national team, but the Eintracht Frankfurt left back appears focused on making it with Germany.

The 22-year-old broke out last season with Frankfurt, earning a starting role and finishing the season with three goals and seven assists as the club finished third and clinched a Champions League berth.

Brown's stellar campaign led to speculation over his international future. The defender was born and raised in Germany but is eligible for the United States through his American father.

In an interview with Eintracht Frankfurt's in-house media, Brown was asked if he had considered the possibility of representing the USMNT.

""Yes of course,"" Brown responded.

""There has already been contact [from U.S. Soccer], but I was born in Germany and I have already played with the under-21s.”

Brown has not yet earned a call-up from Germany's senior team but has been a regular for the U-21 team, which he represented this summer in the UEFA U-21 European Championship.

The defender's acknowledgment of contact from U.S. Soccer appears to be the first confirmation that anybody from the federation has reached out.

When asked last year about recruiting dual nationals, USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino said he and his staff would target priority players, but also warned against recruiting too hard.

""We don't need to convince [players],"" Pochettino said. ""A player needs to want to play for the for the national team.

""We need to be careful. [There is] no need to convince a player. One player cannot be more important than the team or 300 million people. The player, if he's an American player, needs to be desperate, needs to show that we need him. Because if not, we are a weak federation.""","{'href': 'https://prosoccerwire.usatoday.com', 'title': 'Pro Soccer Wire'}","soccer"

Mauricio Pochettino's preparations for the 2026 FIFA World Cup are well underway as the U.S. men's national team head coach scouts in preseason.

The Argentine, along with other members of the USMNT coaching staff, were in attendance over the weekend for a Southampton vs. Espanyol preseason tie in which Damion Downs made his debut for the Saints. Coincidentally enough, the match was between two clubs Pochettino used to manage back in the day. He also was a prominent figure in his playing days at the latter.

Stealing headlines for USMNT fans was Damion Downs.

Downs moved from 1. FC Köln to EFL Championship side Southampton this summer signing a four-year deal with the Saints. The 21-year-old was born in Germany but held dual citizenship in the U.S. given his father is American and his mother German. Downs previously represented Germany at the U-20 level, but he made his USMNT senior debut this past summer in the Concacaf Gold Cup after receiving his first call-up. He is now cap-tied to the country.

Downs scored the game-winning penalty in a shootout against Costa Rica in the Gold Cup quarterfinals. Pochettino's appearance at the game adds further fuel to an ongoing debate around who should start at striker this summer, a position under heavy scrutiny by fans and pundits alike.

It didn't take long for Downs to impress the Southampton fans in attendance, manager Will Still and his national team coach in his preseason debut. Watch the goal below.

Downs delivers ✉️ 

Off the mark on his first appearance 🔥

The goal served as a consolation given Southampton lost on the day, but a positive start for Downs as USMNT strikers garner headlines in the EFL Championship. The second division in England features Josh Sargent at Norwich City, Haji Wright of Coventry City and Gold Cup teammate Patrick Agyemang who moved to Derby County this summer from Charlotte FC.

With Downs playing a role in the Gold Cup amid notable senior absences this summer and Pochettino's appearance, perhaps the Southampton striker could force the head coach to include him in his 2026 plans if he kicks on this season.

Tim Vickery reveals who Fluminense's most important player is ahead of the Club World Cup. (0:43)

Tournaments instantly become history, but they have ramifications. More than two weeks have passed since the final whistle blew at the FIFA Club World Cup, yet its impact is still being felt, not in trophy cabinets, but in transfer negotiations.

For some players at South American clubs, this wasn't just another competition on the calendar. It was a chance to prove they belonged on bigger stages. With scouts in the stands and clubs watching closely, the tournament became a launchpad. Perform well here, and a big move could transpire.

That's exactly what happened. Several players have used the Club World Cup to boost their stock. Here are some of the names who turned their performances into transfers.

- Brazilian clubs shine at Club World Cup, but what's next?
- Summer transfer grades: All major deals rated



The Colombian was so impressive in Brazilian side Fluminense's surprise ride to the semifinals of the Club World Cup. Arias was named man of the match in three games and made the official team of the tournament. And finally, he has made his move to Europe, joining Premier League side Wolverhampton Wanderers.

It should probably be surprising that Arias has taken this long to cross the Atlantic. For the past three years, he has been one of the top players in South America. Fluminense signed him on the cheap in 2021, and perhaps even they were surprised by the progress he made in their colors.

An attacking midfielder, Arias usually featured for them playing from the right wing, becoming so important to the team that he was handed the liberty to wander infield. He excels at turning and surging away from his marker. He also combines well and hits a mean set piece, made apparent when he scored against South Korean side Ulsan HD last month with a superbly struck free kick.

He was key to the Fluminense side that won the CONMEBOL Libertadores in 2023. At the end of the year, they were steamrolled by Manchester City in the final of the Club World Cup. But amid the 4-0 defeat, the Colombian stood out, carrying the fight to the opposition on his own.

After showing that he belonged in such company, it was surprising that he did not move in the winter window and even more so when he stayed put through the next one, in the middle of 2024. By then, he had shone for the Colombia national team in their run to the final of the Copa América, only this time in a very different role.

To accommodate James Rodríguez, Arias was part of a disciplined midfield trio, highly effective in a much more restrictive role. He had demonstrated his versatility, his ability to prioritize the collective's needs over his own, yet the big money offer still did not come. Finally, the Club World Cup gave him the stage, and he used it to seal the move to Wolves.

Why did it take so long? Almost certainly because of his age (Arias turns 28 in September). The European teams -- fueled by the success of Real Madrid's boldness in signing the teenage Vinícius Júnior -- have been looking for adolescents, for promises rather than realities.

The Club World Cup might have served as a reminder that this is not always be the best policy.



Following Arias across the Atlantic is another Colombian with an interesting Brazilian backstory. Ríos was in typically spiky, dynamic form for Palmeiras in the Club World Cup. He was a futsal player, representing his country in a tournament in Rio de Janeiro.

Rangy and versatile, he soon became an important part of the side, and, together with Arias, forced his way into the Colombia lineup. Once again, the Club World Cup has worked its magic. There was interest from AS Roma, but Benfica have emerged victorious, luring the 25-year-old to Portugal.

They have acquired a leggy, rangy midfielder with a wide range of skills. He is a fiery character, sometimes too much, as seen in a recent clash with his now-teammate and Argentina defender Nicolás Otamendi in a recent World Cup qualifier.

A post shared by ESPN FC (@espnfc)

There is a snap in his fierce tackling and a rebellious spirit in his capacity to come out with a sudden short-space dribble.

He is also a fine striker of the ball, and for all the edge to his game, he has also shown his ability to knuckle down and play a supporting role to Rodriguez in the national team, like Arias.

Indeed, his form for Colombia in last year's Copa América was arguably even more impressive than his displays for Palmeiras.



Roma might have lost out in the race for Ríos, but they were able to get signature of Flamengo's fast right back, whose goal on July 17 in the 2-1 win over Red Bull Bragantino was seen as a farewell gesture.

He is 21, making this more of a conventional South America-to-Europe transfer, but the Club World Cup did him little harm, even if it did highlight some of his defensive weaknesses.

He was at fault for the goal that Pedro Neto scored for Chelsea in the group game, but responded well to his mistake and played a good second half as Flamengo emerged victorious against the eventual champions.

He is at his best when going forward, where he can cut in toward the area, and his speed is also useful when running back to goal. Wesley agreed terms with Roma after turning down an advance from Zenit St. Petersburg of Russia.



A player whose international chances should not suffer as a result of a move is center forward Jesus, who swaps Botafogo for Nottingham Forest. In a deal that was done before the start of the Club World Cup, Jesus was left out of Carlo Ancelotti's first Brazil squad, but the very next day, Ancelotti was in the stadium to see the player produce a magnificent performance under pressure.

Needing to win to stay alive in the Libertadores, Botafogo were quickly a man down. Jesus saw them over the line by scoring the only goal of the game, worrying the opposing defenders all night and providing a tenacious first line of defense. In the Club World Cup, he did something similar against vastly superior opposition, scoring the goal that brought a famous victory over reigning UEFA Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain.

The 24-year-old is another to have taken a long and winding road. He began last year with Shabib Al Alhi in the United Arab Emirates, but Botafogo, with their excellent scouting system, had him on the radar and brought him back to Brazil on a free transfer in the middle of the year.

They unleashed him in July when he was a relative unknown. But by September, he was starting for Brazil in World Cup qualification. On his day, he operates as a one-man forward line by holding up the ball and combining, running beyond the defense into the channels, making goals and scoring them, while also defending from the front with rare intensity. It will be fascinating to follow his progress in the Premier League.



Signed from Santos at the start of the year, Jair spent 2024 in Brazil's second division. An injury to the Angolan center back Bastos meant that Jair was thrown straight into the starting lineup, and with Botafogo going through a transitional time, things were not always easy.

He was seen at his best in that Club World Cup triumph against PSG, where he hardly put a foot wrong. But he is still very much a work in progress. Against PSG, Botafogo defended close to their own goal.

Herculez Gomez and Cristina Alexander debate the biggest storylines and break down the best highlights that soccer in the Americas has to offer. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only)

In the previous game, against Seattle Sounders, he looked vulnerable in open space and this has been the pattern of the six months he spent with Botafogo. His passing out of defense has been patchy and at times, he appeared short of confidence.

And for all his size, he'll have to toughen up physically for the battles ahead. There were moments when he was bullied by tough center forwards, and he was not as dominant in the air as might be expected from a defender of his stature.

Forest have been specialists at defending in a low block, which should suit him, but he might well need plenty of time on the training ground to get him up to scratch.

Jair, then, has been signed more for promise than reality, which has been the recent template for many of the deals that European clubs have been doing in South America. The lesson of the Club World Cup, however, is that some more experienced names on the continent are also worthy of consideration, and Arias now spearheads the challenge of South America's new and older European intake.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","'Superb' player should be Chelsea's final signing after Xavi Simons and Jorrel Hato, he's the missing piece","https://www.thechelseachronicle.com/columnist/superb-player-should-be-chelseas-final-signing-after-xavi-simons-and-jorrel-hato-hes-the-missing-piece/","Tue, 29 Jul 2025 13:45:00 GMT","

Despite a very strong start to the summer transfer window, Chelsea are still looking to spend plenty more money before the September deadline.

Reports have stated that the Blues are closing in on deals for Dutch pair Xavi Simons and Jorrel Hato, with player sales playing a part in their interest in both.

Renato Veiga is expected to leave this summer, while Ben Chilwell remains firmly out of the plans, leaving no obvious rotation option for Marc Cucurella.

As for Simons, Joao Felix is set for a move to Al Nassr, while interest remains in the services for Christopher Nkunku despite his impressive Club World Cup.

Earlier in the summer transfer window, there was strong interest in a new goalkeeper, with the likes of Mike Maignan and Gianluigi Donnarumma linked.

The Blues have walked away from Maignan after failed negotiations with AC Milan, however the Champions League winner remains an option this summer.

Chelsea fans got a good enough look at the goalkeeper during the recent Club World Cup final. While he was helpless up against three magnificent goals, he did make a stunning save to deny Liam Delap in the second half.

The Blues have put in a lot of work to fill the gaps in their squad this summer, however goalkeeper is one area where supporters would like strengthening.

Donnarumma has previously been described as ‘superb' (OneFootball), and would bring much-needed top-level experience to a still young Chelsea side.

Last season, it was reported that Maresca had lost confidence in Sanchez, and was looking to strengthen his options ahead of his second campaign in charge.

However, the Spaniard enjoyed a tremendous set of performances during the Club World Cup, picking up the Golden Glove award.

Now, Maresca has given his backing to Sanchez ahead of the 2025/26 season, however this may well change if Chelsea make a move for one of the best goalkeepers in world football.

With just one year left on his current deal, the Blues must test the waters to sign Donnarumma, however will be wary to make sure any signing fits into their current wage strategy.","{'href': 'https://www.thechelseachronicle.com', 'title': 'The Chelsea Chronicle'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Why are football's player unions so powerless compared with U.S. sports?","https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6512013/2025/07/29/football-unions-influence-fifpro/","Tue, 29 Jul 2025 04:10:28 GMT","

FIFA president Gianni Infantino spent much of the summer strolling around the U.S. at the Club World Cup, usually either following President Donald Trump or being followed by a group of football legends ready to declare how brilliant his latest idea is.

But as players wilted in the heat and games were delayed by extreme weather conditions, some were keen to offer an alternative view.

“What was presented as a global festival of football,” said a statement by Sergio Marchi, the president of global players' union FIFPro, “was nothing more than a fiction staged by FIFA, driven by its president, without dialogue, without sensitivity and without respect for those who sustain the game with their daily efforts.”

Punchy.

Marchi went on to refer to the tournament as a “grandiloquent staging that inevitably recalls the ‘bread and circuses' of Nero's Rome” and said the “inequality, precariousness and lack of protection of the real protagonists deepens”.

The language may have been a little florid, but Marchi's statement served a purpose. This tournament was the latest and perhaps most trumpeted example of something FIFPro has been talking about for years: the crowded international football calendar and the increasing demands being placed on footballers.

It's the sort of thing you would expect a players' union to be vocal about, and ideally change. The problem is, their efforts to get the global football authorities to do anything tangible have been frustrated.

And not for the first time. Which raises the question: why is it so hard for FIFPro, and other player unions, to gain traction in football?

“FIFA's governance model allows them to do whatever they want,” Alex Phillips, FIFPro's secretary general, tells The Athletic. 

“They're a law unto themselves. It's not just FIFA: this happens on a national level, and we see this quite a lot where the federation or the league don't like what the union is saying because they're challenging their power.”

A perfect illustration of this came after Marchi's statement and the farcical situation where Infantino held a meeting to discuss the calendar issue, with some representatives from players' unions present, but not FIFPro.

Apparent union members from Brazil, Spain, Ukraine, Mexico, Switzerland, Ivory Coast, Latvia, Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic were all present instead. FIFPro had been involved in some lower-level discussions about the football calendar, but were not invited to this more high-profile discussion.

After that meeting, FIFA announced a consensus had been reached, that players must have at least 72 hours of rest between matches and there should be at least 21 days of rest at the end of each season. Which is fine (even though FIFPro says it should be at least 28 days at the end of each season), but the FIFA press release went on to say these stipulations “should be managed individually by each club and the respective players”.

Why were FIFPro left out of a meeting like this? According to Marchi, the man at the top is the problem.

“The biggest obstacle is the autocracy of the FIFA president, who doesn't listen — he lives in his own world,” Marchi told The Athletic this week.

“He believes that only the big spectacles are the ones that bring importance. And we feel that he's not listening to the voices of all the football players, to the needs of the players. It's great that we have a World Cup, a Club World Cup, or any world championship because it's a wonderful celebration, but that celebration wasn't created by him. It was created by the players and the spectators, the fans.

“He's simply a manager, not the owner of it. But that's not the most important thing. What's important are all the players around the world, and I've clearly told him this — I've said it to his face.”

A FIFA statement on Friday read: “FIFA is extremely disappointed by the increasingly divisive and contradictory tone adopted by FIFPro leadership as this approach clearly shows that, rather than engaging in constructive dialogue, FIFPro has chosen to pursue a path of public confrontation driven by artificial PR battles — which have nothing to do with protecting the welfare of professional players, but rather aim to preserve their own personal positions and interests.

“The global football community deserves better. Players deserve better.”

The statement discussed the summit, stating they had made “unsuccessful efforts to bring FIFPro to the table in an environment of non-hostility and respectful, progressive dialogue”.

It also said FIFA are looking to introduce measures whereby players and player unions are represented in FIFA's standing committees and the possibility of them participating in FIFA Council meetings when players' matters are being addressed.

FIFA sources, speaking anonymously to protect relationships, also said that the world governing body “made a genuine effort to engage” with Marchi and FIFPro's new leadership when welcoming them to FIFA headquarters in Zurich in January of this year.

For anyone used to observing how unions work in American sports, all of this would seem very strange.

In America, most sports literally cannot go ahead without a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) being reached, something negotiated between the league and the players' unions. In baseball, there are already strong fears that the 2027 season will be disrupted and the players could go on strike, largely because of anticipated differences between the parties over salary caps in the next CBA negotiations, which have been desired by the clubs for some time but are the ultimate line in the sand for players.

The 1994 season was curtailed (the World Series didn't take place) and the start of the 1995 season was delayed because of a dispute involving salary caps, which has echoes in the anticipated issues for 2027.

It's happened in other sports, too. The 2004-05 NHL season was cancelled over a similar disagreement related to salary caps, while the start of the 2011-12 NBA season was delayed due to disputes over the sport's CBA. The NFL also suffered a player lockout in 2011 over a variety of issues, although that was confined to the off-season and no actual games were lost.

The point is that in those cases, the players' unions had the power to bring the whole sport to a halt. In football, those at the top of the sport can afford to ignore them.

One of the main reasons for this is those big U.S. sports are closed markets, operating in a single country. There are places other than America for baseball or basketball or hockey, but the elite level is so far above everything else that it's essentially the only place to play. In football, it's very different: a player can go almost anywhere they want, which is broadly a positive, but reduces leverage when it comes to disputes with the governing powers.

“We need to keep in mind that we're in an open market here, unlike the U.S.,” says Maheta Molango, the chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association in the UK.

“This is the problem we have, in comparison to U.S. sports — multiple stakeholders that all utilise the same assets. By which I mean players — and I use the word assets on purpose because that's how the players are treated.

“You don't have multiple stakeholders in U.S. sports, you just have the leagues. We have many: the leagues, the confederations and then the international bodies. All of them use the same assets.”

And in the case of the crammed international calendar, those stakeholders keep adding games and further commitments for the players. So you'll have UEFA adding extra games to the Champions League, or creating a new competition such as the Conference League, while FIFA is conjuring the Club World Cup out of thin air, or adding more teams (and thus more games) to the proper World Cup.

Throw in clubs shoehorning pre- and post-season tours into the schedule whenever they can, and it becomes like multiple children adding items on to the Buckaroo! mule, with little care given to anything around them. The unions' job — to do its best to stop the mule from chucking everything up in the air — thus becomes pretty tricky.

“They all have their own calendar, which make sense when you look at them individually, but they don't make any sense when you look at them holistically because they don't talk to each other,” adds Molango.

We should make clear that the unions are busy with other things as well. Phillips cites an issue raised by The Athletic recently, about the number of former players going bankrupt, which is something unions help with, along with other post-career services. When a player lower down the food chain is in dispute with their club, unions step in there, too.

But on the biggest issue of the day, the international calendar, the unions have comparatively little leverage. And perhaps the biggest single reason is that wide-scale industrial action is incredibly difficult.

Industrial action from players has been mentioned in passing, as vague threats around certain issues. In September 2024, Rodri said that strikes were “close” in protest against the overwhelming international calendar, and that players will have “no other option” if more games keep being added.

That was particularly notable because he was speaking a few days before he was ruled out for the remainder of the season after damaging ligaments in his knee: it can't be definitively proven that this was a consequence of him playing 67 games for club and country over the preceding year, but such a workload can't have helped.

But no large-scale, international strikes have materialised, partly because it's incredibly difficult. You have to negotiate the different labour laws in different countries, for a start. That's enough to give any lawyer a headache.

Getting enough players to align behind an individual issue is tough, and you need either a massive weight of numbers or some high-profile players to sign up to the cause in order to make the relevant authority sit up. Will anyone in the latter group be willing to risk their own positions, risk their own money, essentially, for something that might not really impact them?

The scale of the game is another problem. It's possible to take industrial action on individual, national levels — Colombian players, for example, voted to strike earlier this year — but on an international scale, which is the sort of level that you would need to really make FIFA jump, is impractical.

On a technical level, FIFPro also can't organise a strike. “We don't have players as members,” says Phillips, “so we can't call players and say go on strike because our members are national player unions and national player associations.”

In any case, conversations with those involved in the unions suggest there really isn't the appetite to treat strikes as anything other than a final, final step. “No worker wants to stop working and not get paid,” says Phillips, “so it's a final resort when negotiations fail.”

There perhaps lies one area where the unions could be doing more. Conversations with players past and present, kept anonymous to allow them to protect relationships, suggested that most weren't unhappy with the work their unions did, but felt they could be more proactive, more confrontational, even, with the authorities.

Still, the impetus doesn't have to come from the unions. “It's no longer the unions calling for potential strikes; it's the players themselves,” says Molango.

“The number of issues that could lead to strikes are limited, however those are issues that are so easy for players to feel the consequences of that you shouldn't discount anything. When you've had players who have suffered an ACL or have mental wellbeing issues because they have played too much, it's no longer you convincing them of the need for action. It's them saying we need to protect ourselves.”

Marchi, who, as we've established, is not shy about talking a good game, will perhaps help the perception that the unions are too soft. But ultimately influence, without resorting to strike action, is what the unions are there for — and what FIFPro is looking for.

“We have a good relationship with FIFA on an operational level in most departments, but we don't have any decision-making power,” says Phillips. “And that's what we're fighting for — to have a say at the top table, on issues that directly affect players' rights. To have a veto so that we would negotiate those rights, as happens on a national level, together with the clubs.

“We need a change in the decision-making process, and U.S. sports are way ahead of us on that because the players have an equal say on the big issues that affect professional players.”

Will they get that? It's hard to see it happening any time soon.

Bayern striker considering PL return

Bundesliga club may be willing to do business

Manchester United leading the race

Follow GOAL on WhatsApp! 🟢📱

Per the Telegraph, industry insiders believe that Kane may be available next summer, after the 2026 World Cup. The England captain's contract is said to have a clause that decreases each year, and Bayern may be willing to do business. The striker turned 32 this month and his contract expires in 2027.

Per the report, Manchester United are deemed the most likely to land Kane's signature if he does move next summer. Tottenham secured a first-option clause in the deal to sell Kane to Bayern but it would only kick in if the Bundesliga club agreed to sell him, and if the former Spurs star were willing to return to north London.

Kane has been remarkably consistent for Bayern since his arrival in 2023, scoring 85 goals in 96 games. He finally ended his long-running trophy drought last season as Bayern won the Bundesliga.

by Francisco Quatrin July 29, 2025

Al Nassr is currently undergoing a full-scale restructuring both on and off the field. The only constants at the moment appear to be Cristiano Ronaldo's dominant leadership and a coaching change, with Jorge Jesus — who recently coached rivals Al Hilal — taking the reins. Everything else remains uncertain.

Names continue to surface as part of the club's revamp, and the latest is Chelsea left-back Marc Cucurella, who has emerged as a potential target for the Saudi side. Al Nassr is reportedly preparing a lucrative offer that could be hard to turn down for the Spaniard, whose stock has risen significantly under new Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca.

Despite Chelsea's deep roster, the left-back position is not particularly crowded, with Cucurella and Ben Chilwell as the only natural options. This contrasts with the club's abundance of center-backs and midfielders, increasing the likelihood that Cucurella could be sold for the right price.

Al Nassr is also in talks to sign João Félix as they work to build a squad aligned with Ronaldo's ambitions. The club is not just looking to strengthen the team but also to re-energize a fanbase that has grown frustrated with recent poor results — especially as Al Hilal and Al Ittihad continue to pull ahead.

Cucurella played a vital role in Chelsea's recent UEFA Conference League and FIFA Club World Cup victories. Although he currently intends to continue his career in the Premier League, Al Nassr is expected to approach him with a compelling offer aimed at making him a key figure in the Saudi Pro League.

The Spanish international has recently bounced back after a rough stretch marked by injuries and criticism, re-establishing himself as an essential piece of Chelsea's defense.

All is in readiness for the start of a new edition of the Leagues Cup, the competition that pits teams from MLS against those from the Mexican League. Following initial trial years of the tournament and in a friendly format, this will be the third official edition of a tournament that has steadily grown in importance and prominence.

So far, there are only two champions: Inter Miami and Columbus Crew. The Herons, spearheaded by Lionel Messi, were the inaugural champions of this competition since it gained official status, defeating Nashville in a thrilling final decided by a penalty shoot-out. This triumph marked the first title in the history of David Beckham's franchise.

In last year's edition, Columbus Crew emerged victorious, overcoming Los Angeles FC 3-1 on home turf. The roll of honour is completed by Cruz Azul (2019) and Leon (2021), who were crowned champions when the tournament was not yet officially recognised.

Teams from MLS and the Mexican League are increasingly competitive, even against European powerhouses.

Clear evidence of this was seen in the recent Club World Cup, where as many as five Mexican and American teams participated (Monterrey, Pachuca, Los Angeles FC, Seattle Sounders and Inter Miami).

In addition, Leon also qualified for the intercontinental event, and America contended for a place until the very last moment.

Inter Miami defeated Porto, while Monterrey forced a draw against Inter, the Champions League runners-up, for example. This further demonstrates that the Leagues Cup is a tournament that has been steadily gaining prestige and is certain to deliver some major clashes.

Spain beat England to win the World Cup in 2023

England may still be celebrating their second successive European Championship but it will not be long before attention turns to the next big challenge on the horizon - the Women's World Cup.

Two years ago the Lionesses reached the final in Australia for the first time, losing 1-0 to Spain, and it remains the one gaping hole in their trophy cabinet.

Manager Sarina Wiegman, who has now won the Euros three times, has twice been runner-up at a World Cup - once with the Netherlands and once with England - and will be desperate to go one better.

In 2027 the tournament will take place in South America for the first time, in Brazil, so what might the England team look like in two years and what are their chances of winning it?

Meet the England players who secured Euro 2025

Fans join Lionesses for 'unbelievable' Euros parade

Four Lionesses in Euro 2025 team of the tournament

Millie Bright has played a crucial role under Wiegman but missed Euro 2025

Lucy Bronze, by far the most experienced member of the England squad, is also the oldest and by the time the World Cup comes around she will be 35.

Yet the World Cup is the one major piece of silverware missing from her extensive collection of medals for club and country and after winning their first European title she said ""there's still one more we can get our hands on"". That is still unfinished business.  

Bronze has previously spoken about not retiring ""unless my body gives up on me"" and has shown little sign of her age affecting her availability. 

Having been involved in 19 of Chelsea's 22 Women's Super League (WSL) games during their title win last season, Bronze then started every England game at Euro 2025, where she was named in Uefa's team of the tournament.

However, she did reveal after the final that she had been playing in Switzerland with a fractured leg, while she also suffered a knee injury against Spain - and injuries could become more of an issue.

Other players involved in the current squad who would be over 30 in Brazil are Alex Greenwood, who is currently 31, Beth Mead, 30, and uncapped goalkeeper Anna Moorhouse, also 30.

Another player who was not involved in Switzerland and faces an uncertain England future is Millie Bright, who turns 32 next month, and her retirement would not be a surprise. 

She made herself unavailable at Euro 2025, saying she was not able to give 100% mentally or physically, and while still valued highly by Wiegman, two of her past three seasons have been heavily disrupted by injuries.

Grace Clinton was involved in all of England's knockout matches in Switzerland

It is impossible not to highlight teenage striker Michelle Agyemang, who has made such a big impression in a small amount of time.

The 19-year-old may only have five caps for England, making her debut in April, but she has already scored three memorable goals and played a pivotal role in England retaining their European title.

If she continues on her current trajectory she will be pushing Alessia Russo for a starting spot - although may have to displace her at club level first, with both playing for Arsenal. Wiegman could also consider playing them together.

Another of England's most exciting young talents is Grace Clinton, who has long been tipped to become a regular starter for her country following her impressive displays at club level.

The 22-year-old Manchester United midfielder was given a starting role in the absence of the injured Georgia Stanway earlier this year, while Wiegman showed how much she trusted Clinton at Euro 2025 by using her as a substitute in all except the game against Wales, bringing her on in every knockout match when results were in the balance.

Wiegman has been loyal to Keira Walsh and Stanway in midfield but they did not have as great an impact in Switzerland as at previous tournaments and Clinton could be the one to break up the partnership.

Like Agyemang and Clinton, highly rated striker Aggie Beever-Jones, midfielder Jess Park and defender Maya le Tissier were also at their first major tournament. With two years' more experience come the World Cup in Brazil, they might be handed much greater roles.

Manchester United captain Le Tissier, 23, has often been overlooked by Wiegman but continues to impress at club level, and it is in defence where England might make the biggest changes having not fully convinced in Switzerland where they conceded seven goals in six matches.

While captain Leah Williamson and Bronze have been permanent fixtures in defence, the other centre-back role and left-back have been problem positions, and the manager will hope first-choice candidates emerge to create a consistent back four.

At this summer's Euros Wiegman blended youth with experience, but there is plenty to be done over the next two years to develop some of those young players into starters at international tournaments.

Other defenders who might push the current regulars include Washington Spirit's Esme Morgan, 24, who made one start at Euro 2025, while Aston Villa's Lucy Parker, 26, and Tottenham's Ella Morris, 22, are both uncapped but had England call-ups in the past year.

Former Chelsea manager Emma Hayes became USA manager in May 2024

It is hard to look further than the United States and Spain.

The USA team are now managed by Englishwoman Emma Hayes, who has restored them to the top of the world rankings after they dropped to fifth following their worst performance at a Women's World Cup in 2023, when they went out in the last 16.

Prior to that they had won the previous two World Cups. They bounced back from their disappointment in Australia by winning the Olympics in Paris last summer, just three months after the former Chelsea boss took charge, and will no doubt be among the favourites to lift the trophy in Brazil.

Spain, meanwhile, are the World Cup holders and came agonisingly close to adding the European title with their defeat on penalties by England at Euro 2025.

In Switzerland they showed that at their best it is difficult for any team to live with them, while they continue to churn out world-class players with the performances of Barcelona midfielder Vicky Lopez, who has just turned 19, suggesting she will be one to watch in Brazil.

Conditions might also play a factor, with the American and Spanish players more accustomed to playing in hot weather than the Lionesses, whose players are mostly based in England. Yet when the men's World Cup was held in Brazil in 2014, Germany's triumph showed that a northern European team could still thrive in unfamiliar conditions.

One team who would be expected to flourish in that climate would be hosts Brazil, who will also have the added boost of home support.

They had a disappointing tournament two years ago, failing to make it past the group stage as Jamaica finished ahead of them. 

But just 12 months later they were impressive at the Paris Olympics, knocking out hosts France and Spain on their way to the final, and where better to end their search for a first international title than on home soil?

When it comes to major tournaments it is also hard not to mention two-time champions Germany, while perennial underachievers France and former winners Japan are capable of competing with the world's best.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","World Cup 2026 a 'massive opportunity' to get the country 'behind our team,' Landon Donovan says","https://www.latimes.com/sports/soccer/story/2025-07-29/on-soccer-usmnt","Tue, 29 Jul 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

Landon Donovan can't be sure he would have played international soccer had the World Cup not come to Pasadena in 1994, but he can say with certainty he wasn't aware what international soccer was until then.

“I went to one game,” said Donovan, who was a 12-year-old prodigy the first time the World Cup was played in the U.S. “And I knew nothing — and I mean nothing — about soccer on the global scale. It opened my eyes because there was no soccer on TV, no internet. I didn't know anything about it.”

Eight years after watching Romania eliminate Argentina at the Rose Bowl, Donovan was scoring the U.S. team's final goal in the 2002 World Cup, helping the Americans reach the quarterfinals for the only time in the modern era.

The tournament will be back in the U.S. in less than 11 months, with the U.S. playing two of its three group games at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood. And Donovan is certain some of the people watching will be kids who, like him, will be inspired by their first up-close look at the global game.

“There's millions of kids who maybe played a little bit, or thought about playing, or play a lot and go to a World Cup game. It changes their life forever,” he said.

“Millions” might be a bit of a stretch, but the sentiment  is well-taken. And it's not just one Donovan experienced himself, but a transformation he saw take place at the 2015 Women's World Cup final in Vancouver as well.

The FIFA Club World Cup exposed some significant issues that could hamper the 2026 World Cup, with hot weather being among the top concerns.

“I was watching these little girls in front of me just completely fall in love with the game right in front of my eyes,” he said. “That's part of the reason why I'm critical or passionate about our team. It's because I understand what the opportunity is.”

The criticism and passion Donovan is referencing are comments he made last month on the Unfiltered Soccer podcast he does with former USMNT teammate Tim Howard. In discussing the decision of players such as Christian Pulisic and Yunus Musah to pass up this summer's CONCACAF Gold Cup, the last major tournament before next year's World Cup, Donovan said their choice to take a “vacation” angered him.

The comments seemed hypocritical since Donovan took his own well-chronicled sabbatical from the game in 2013, missing some World Cup qualifiers. And in his case the break helped, with Donovan returning to the national team that summer to get a career-high 24 points (on eight goals and eight assists) in 10 games, only one of which the U.S. lost.

Pulisic said he needed both a mental and physical break after playing a career-high 3,650 minutes in all competitions for AC Milan last season and appearing in 118 games for club and country in the last 22 months. Donovan believes in and supports that idea, he clarified in a phone interview last week.

It was the timing he didn't like.

“That's his decision and only he gets to make that decision,” Donovan said. “So my criticism was never with him or anyone taking a break. It was choosing when to take the break and from which team they were taking the break.”

“It was at the expense of the national team growing this summer,” he added.

When Donovan took his respite he missed five games with the national team as well as training camp and five games with the Galaxy, which cost him the armband as captain and, he says, $1 million in salary. Pulisic, he argued, could have done the same, splitting his break between his club and the national team.

“So it was never about taking a break. The break is justified,” Donovan said. “It's about prioritizing the national team.”

 Soccer 

U.S. soccer coach Mauricio Pochettino coaxed overlooked players into fighting for their country, setting a higher standard for his World Cup roster.

The idea of AC Milan giving Pulisic time off is a nonstarter, however. The American is the fifth-best-paid player at the club, earning a reported $5.8 million a season, and he was the team leader in goals and assists last season. With Milan chasing a European tournament berth down the stretch, there was no time for rest so Pulisic started 12 games in the final 7½ weeks. He was on fumes when the final whistle sounded.

So Donovan's comments seemed influenced more by wisdom and jealously than reality.

Wisdom because, at 43, he knows that playing for the national team is an honor that doesn't last forever and when it's over you regret the games you missed more than you celebrate the ones you played. And jealousy because for all that Donovan accomplished — he retired as the national team's all-time leader in goals, assists and starts and the MLS record-holder in goals, assists and championships — he never played a World Cup game at home. Pulisic, who turns 27 next month, will get that chance.

“That would have been incredible to play a World Cup in your prime in your home country. And knowing two of the games are in L.A., that is literally a dream come true,” he said.

“There is a massive opportunity to build this thing and get this country behind our team. I just don't want this opportunity to get wasted.”

The last World Cup in the U.S. ended with the country forming a top-tier professional league in MLS, soccer becoming a top-five sport in the U.S., and the U.S. Soccer Foundation getting the funding needed to help grow soccer at the grassroots level. It also inspired a youthful Landon Donovan to become the greatest player in the country's history.

As a result, the tournament will return to a country with a soccer culture far advanced from 1994.

“There's a massive, massive wealth of talent here,” said Donovan, who speaks from experience after spending part of last week at a “dream team” tryout organized by Spanish club Real Madrid and Abbott, a global leader in the healthcare industry. “Some of those kids out there — 17, 18 years old — technically are better than guys I played with.”

The top 11 players from five tryout camps will go to Spain to train at Real Madrid's complex. The fact that the richest club in the world came to the U.S. to scout players, Donovan said, is more evidence of soccer's growth in this country, which he believes makes next summer even more important.

“We're at a point where we're doing a lot of things well,” Donovan said. “The one area where we are still struggling is  in our development. It was eye-opening to watch some of these kids because I think we're missing out still on a lot of these players.”

Next summer's World Cup can close that gap, provided we don't waste the opportunity.

As the summer international window closes and we say farewell to the 2025 UEFA Women's Euro, Women's Afcon, and the 2025 Copa America Femenina, it's time to crank up the heat on the build-up to the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup. The biggest women's tournament is set to take place in Brazil, and some nations have already secured their spots in their respective World Cup qualifying competitions, which are scheduled to begin later this year and conclude in 2026. 

England extended their reign over Europe during their comeback run throughout the 2025 Euro and are now two-time Euro champions, while 2023 World Cup champions Spain had to settle for runners-up. The Euros delivered endless goals in the group stage and high drama in the knockouts, with extra-time matches and penalty shootouts, including in the final, where Chloe Kelly scored the title-deciding penalty. The U.S. women's national team closed out their summer early, with a five-game win streak, pulling off victories against Canada, Ireland, Jamaica, and China.

While the United States, England, and Spain are likely to form a ""big three"" in the globe, when it comes to teams sneaking into the rankings, any team can challenge another. Nigeria reclaimed the title as Africa's best with their 10th Women's Afcon title over Morocco. Brazil has already qualified for the 2027 World Cup as host nation, but they're still on the hunt for another Copa America championship, but Uruguay, Colombia, and Argentina are hopeful to disrupt Brazil's run. 

The 2027 World Cup is 23 months away, and top national teams are locked into preparations for the long journey to Brazil. But where do they rank based on current form?

The most recent winners of a global tournament, the entire first half of the year has been a flex for the program to show how deep it is after the 2024 Olympic gold medal win. Head coach Emma Hayes has mastered roster pool expansion and refining team identity by prioritizing the players and the overall long-term program goals. The USWNT returned to global prominence with their top podium finish in Paris, and under Hayes, remain the gold standard for performance, attacking prowess, and now tactical ability. 

There's no denying the incredible efforts England made to build on their program's history. Back-to-back Euro champions is a near-impossible feat for most programs, but not for the Lionesses. They showed off another aspect of their program with resiliency under manager Sarina Wiegman, and a reminder that sometimes glory comes with a price, as defender Lucy Bronze played through a fractured tibia. 

The 2023 World Cup champions had to settle for runners-up at the Euro, but despite the penalty heartbreak, their technical brilliance led the march toward the final. They'll have a chance to make another statement during the upcoming UEFA Nations League, but their Euro performance showed once again they're a top side in the world. Their possession-based style with a midfield of maestros in Aitana Bonmati, Alexia Putellas, and Patri Guajirro will keep them elite. 

The 2027 World Cup hosts are on the rise following their silver medal finish at the 2024 Olympics. They handed the USWNT one of their two losses this year, and are currently dominating the Copa America. The group is building toward a home World Cup as Marta's presence is still a factor for the squad, and her legacy is inspiring a new generation of players. Manager Arthur Elias has his team competing with their signature flair, combined with defensive efforts. 

It was hurdle after hurdle for the squad during the Euros, but Germany's pedigree remains. They found a way to the semifinals thanks to goalkeeping heroics by Ann-Katrin Berger and fell short to eventual runners-up Spain. Although Lena Oberdorf has been sidelined as she works back from an ACL injury, Jule Brand, Klara Buhl, and Sjoeke Nüsken remain players to build the program around. 

Veteran Kosovare Asllani spoke up for her squad against critics and oddsmakers who underrated Sweden during the Euros, but unfortunately, the team squandered a two-goal lead in the quarterfinal against England, and they stay outside the top five of this ranking as well. Despite constantly being the obstacle in others' success stories, rather than having a trophy of their own, they're still a tough opponent who will remain a top-ten team with plenty of talent in the pipeline with Rosa Kafaji and Hanna Bennison.

The Nadeshiko delivered an early loss to the USWNT and won the 2025 SheBelieves Cup earlier this year. Their disciplined technicality on the ball makes them a challenging opponent to go up against, and their ability to share attacking responsibility offers a layer of unpredictability for defenders. They'll only get stronger as they integrate more youth to balance with veterans.

Head coach Laurent Bonadei made a statement with his roster choices ahead of the Euros, leaving off veterans Eugénie Le Sommer and Wendie Renard, and another quarterfinal exit for France will just mean more questions around the team's ability in high-stakes tournaments. Hard to count out a team with exciting attacking talents in Delphine Cascarino, Marie Antoinette Katoto, and Sandy Baltimore, but consistency against top teams in the knockout rounds remains elusive. 

A group that caused England plenty of anxiety and troubles during the 2023 World Cup, despite being owed back-pay and a lack of resources, marched right back to the top of the Women's Afcon tournament this year. More official, governing body-type rankings likely won't have an African nation in the top ten, but that's not the case here. There's no way we could leave Africa's powerhouse, the Super Falcons, off the list. Top of the kit rankings shouldn't be the only place where they feature, and after missing out on the Women's Afcon title in 2022, the group completed their ""Mission X"" for a tenth title. Imagine Rasheedat Ajibade and Asisat Oshoala, and Jennifer Echegini could do with more support. 

This team is sitting in last place and barely hanging on. They've got a hold because they have great players whose talents can determine the outcomes of games, and the federation managed to hire a solid coach in Casey Stoney to start the year. But the truth is they're a team that has somewhat regressed since their 2020 Tokyo Olympics gold medal run. Stoney was vocal about the ways the program and players fell short after their 2-0 loss against the USWNT in July, and the roster needs more support if they're to improve moving forward.

Italy: The roster showed significant evolution under head coach Andrea Soncin. They defied expectations during the Euro with a mix of tactical awareness and key players stepping up as they bowed out of the semifinals against eventual tournament winners England. If they can work on defensive lapses and build on their tactics, they could leap into the top ten.

Colombia: Las Chicas Superpoderosas aren't some imitation Powerpuff Girls, but a group who have emerged as bona fide continental figures for South America. They're currently on the hunt to take Brazil's crown in the Copa America, and with Chelsea FC's Mayra Ramirez and Real Madrid's Linda Caicedo, they could rival the crown and leap into our rankings.

Netherlands: The Dutch look like an evaporating version of their 2017 Euro championship run. The roster struggled with its group of death draw in the Euro, now their early elimination means the federation needs to get the next coaching hire right, as they'll have to tackle questions around an aging squad and how to rejuvenate the team in the build-up to the 2027 World Cup, a full decade from their historic Euro title-run.

Red cards in the FIFA World Cup are always dramatic, but some stand out for their controversy, impact, or sheer egregious nature. These dismissals didn't just change games; they became indelible parts of World Cup lore.

by Joe GonzálezEditor

A red card in soccer is a game-changer, but at the FIFA World Cup, it carries even more weight, often deciding the fate of nations. From acts of aggression to moments of pure desperation or even baffling officiating, certain dismissals have etched themselves into the tournament's history. Join us as we count down of the most egregious red cards that left fans, players, and pundits stunned on soccer's grandest stage.

In the 1998 final, French defender Marcel Desailly received a second yellow card for a foul, leading to his dismissal. Despite playing with 10 men for a significant portion, France famously went on to win 3-0 against Brazil.

In a notoriously physical final, Dutch defender John Heitinga was sent off in extra time after receiving a second yellow card. Spain scored the winning goal just minutes later, heavily influencing the outcome of the final.

Uruguay's José Batista holds the record for the fastest red card in World Cup history, sent off after just 56 seconds for a brutal foul on Gordon Strachan. This set the tone for a highly controversial match.

Rigobert Song holds the unwanted record of being one of only two players (along with Zidane) to receive two red cards in separate World Cup tournaments (1994 and 1998). Both were for ill-disciplined challenges, hindering his team.

While not a red card issued at the time, Harald Schumacher's brutal collision with Patrick Battiston left the Frenchman with severe injuries and unconscious. The lack of a red card remains one of the most egregious non-calls in World Cup history, making it effectively a 'phantom' egregious red.

In a bizarre officiating error, Croatian defender Josip Šimunić received three yellow cards from referee Graham Poll before finally being sent off. It was a chaotic and unprecedented sequence of events in a World Cup match.

England's hopes were dashed when Wayne Rooney was sent off for stamping on Ricardo Carvalho. The moment was intensified by his Manchester United teammate Cristiano Ronaldo's reaction and wink after the dismissal, sparking immense controversy.

After being fouled, David Beckham controversially flicked his leg at Diego Simeone, resulting in a straight red card. England went on to lose the match on penalties, and Beckham faced severe criticism back home.

In a moment of incredible drama, Luis Suárez was sent off for deliberately handling the ball on the goal line, denying Ghana a clear goal in extra time. Ghana missed the resulting penalty, and Uruguay won the shootout, making it a ""save"" that changed history.

In his final professional match, Zinedine Zidane famously headbutted Marco Materazzi in the chest during extra time of the World Cup Final. This shocking act led to his red card and is one of the most iconic and infamous dismissals in soccer history.

by Francisco Quatrin July 29, 2025

After much speculation about the date and location of the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw, it's now confirmed: the event will take place in Las Vegas, Nevada, a city that surprisingly won't be hosting any matches during the tournament.

Although an official announcement from FIFA is still pending, reports indicate that the world-famous Sphere will serve as the venue for the draw that determines the group stage matchups.

Mexican journalist Gibrán Araige broke the news, revealing that the World Cup group stage draw will be held on Friday, December 5, 2025, in Las Vegas. He also confirmed during an appearance on the news show Despierta that the Sphere—known for its cutting-edge visuals and immersive experience—will host the ceremony.

Las Vegas beat out other candidate cities, including some of the 16 official host cities for the World Cup across North America: 11 in the United States, 3 in Mexico, and 2 in Canada.

Despite its global appeal, Las Vegas was not selected as a host city for the 2026 tournament. One of the main reasons, according to Steve Hill, CEO of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, was that FIFA could not guarantee the financial return the city expected. Hosting World Cup matches would have required a significant investment, and the projected revenues didn't align with that risk.

Additionally, the Allegiant Stadium was deemed unsuitable. Its current field dimensions don't meet FIFA's regulations for soccer. Making the necessary modifications would have forced the venue to close for nearly nine months, something stadium operators ultimately declined.

Philadelphia Soccer 2026 on Monday unveiled its volunteer center location in the Fashion District in Center City for next summer's FIFA World Cup.

The 18,000-square-foot space at 901 Market St. will serve as the hub for more than 3,000 volunteers that will help direct visitors to the six matches and other World Cup activations held in and around the city.

It will serve as the headquarters for volunteer registration and training as well as a transit hub distributing volunteers to Lincoln Financial Field in South Philadelphia, the Fan Festival in Lemon Hill and transportation sites like 30th Street Station and Philadelphia International Airport.

“Fashion District Philadelphia's selection as the site of Philadelphia Soccer 2026's FIFA World Cup 26 Volunteer Center represents a significant victory for our city,” Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle L. Parker said in a press release. “The center will not only help power critical volunteer efforts supporting FIFA World Cup 26 but also generate significant economic activity for our local businesses, restaurants, and hotels. We are proud to support this effort and the thousands of volunteers who will ensure that next summer's tournament is a success.”

The Philadelphia organizing committee expects more than 3,000 people to volunteer for the World Cup, applications for which begin in August.

The committee has gotten a large groundswell of interest not just from people in the area but international travelers interested in working at the World Cup with Philadelphia as their home base.

Some 20 percent of the interest has come from overseas, the third most for any of the 16 host markets, the committee said.

That number will be augmented by other programs, like SEPTA's ambassadors and the Philadelphia Visitor Center's Phambassadors program, to move the number to more than 4,000 volunteers.

The volunteer hub will be a way to connect the events of South Philadelphia with the city's central business district.

The two-floor location, formerly home to immersive art installations, provides a central location to credential and train volunteers. The city has put aside 3,100 parking spots for World Cup-associated traffic. By providing volunteers with vouchers to patronize local businesses, it's another avenue for economic impact for the global soccer spectacle.

Each of the 16 host cities in the United States, Canada and Mexico will designate such a hub.

Volunteers will aid with wayfinding for visitors to the city and at the stadium complex in South Philadelphia as well as related soccer events in the region even when games aren't being played here.

Philadelphia Soccer 2026 is anticipating more than 7,000 applications.

Though dates are not formally set, the application process via FIFA is slated to open in August and run into the fall, with approvals starting in October. The site on Market will be active well in advance of the June 11 start of the tournament and will run past the final game at the Linc, a Round of 16 match on July 4.

“The Fashion District is an ideal location for FIFA World Cup 26 Philadelphia to welcome and serve the thousands of volunteers who will make the games one of Philadelphia's most successful events in history and a showcase for our city and region,” said Michelle Singer, board co-chair, Philadelphia Soccer 2026. “The site is easily accessible. Volunteers can walk, take public transit or drive, and it is located just blocks away from the country's most historical sites and the city's economic center. There really is no better site to base our large volunteer effort and I am glad we were able to secure it.”

The Bundesliga champions at last have the wide forward they've been craving, and he could hardly be more suited to complementing their No.9

Bayern Munich have long been in the market for a new left winger to raise the ceiling of their team. It's been five years since the electric wide duo of Serge Gnabry and Kingsley Coman helped fire them to Champions League glory, and though they both remain at the club, they are not the offensive weapons they once were.

There were sceptics in Bavaria when Bayern decided to drop £51 million (€60m) on Crystal Palace's Michael Olise last summer, but he has gone someway to silencing them after a spectacular debut campaign at the Allianz Arena. What became clear throughout 2024-25, though, was that they still needed another attacker in their ranks.

In Bayern's dream world, they would have landed Nico Williams. Much like Barcelona, they were left disappointed and probably a little shocked that he decided to sign a new 10-year contract at Athletic Club instead. They were also after Florian Wirtz, but baulked at Bayer Leverkusen's nine-figure asking price, while Paris Saint-Germain have no intention to sell Bradley Barcola.

That's led them to Luis Diaz, who has been given the green light to leave Liverpool for roughly £65m ($87m). Again, there are some question marks over the deal, but they ignore one of the most significant aspects of it - this will get the best out of star striker Harry Kane.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The Blaugrana wanted rid of the Germany goalkeeper, but he's not going anywhere and seems intent on making life very difficult for his employers

Barcelona are arguably the most exciting team in world football right now. Because of their fantastic forwards and ridiculously high defensive line, Hansi Flick's men pretty much guarantee goals at both ends of the pitch, as so thrillingly underlined by their epic Champions League semi-final loss to Inter.

However, Barca are also tremendously entertaining off the field - and particularly during transfer windows. During the Josep Maria Bartomeu era, it was always fun to see which ridiculously expensive and utterly superfluous addition would be made to the squad. Since the election of lever-pulling Joan Laporta as president, the focus has shifted to trying to figure out how on earth the Blaugrana will balance the books.

It's always highly amusing watching Barca sign players they can't afford before then going to comical lengths to try to register the new arrivals with La Liga. In that sense, the Spanish champions are a journalist's dream, an endless supply of drama.

However, even by the Catalans' ludicrously high standards, the 2025 summer could be something special, as the stage is now set for an incredibly compelling soap opera starring Marc-Andre ter Stegen that could end very badly for Barca...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Corentin Moutet and Jenson Brooksby will wrap up first-round action at the Toronto Masters on Tuesday. Most of the order of play features the second round, in which Holger Rune faces Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard.Corentin Moutet vs. (PR) Jenson BrooksbyMoutet is positively surging right now. The 46th-ranked Frenchman finished runner-up on the grass courts of Mallorca and is coming off a semifinal result in Washington, D.C. He has advanced at least one round in seven consecutive main-draw appearances at the ATP level, last losing an opening match at the Madrid Masters in late April.

Up first for Moutet at the National Bank Open on Tuesday is Brooksby, whom he has never faced. The 102nd-ranked American also posted a runner-up finish on grass (Eastbourne), so he should be playing with some confidence despite losing right away in Washington, D.C. at the hands of Yoshihito Nishioka. This should be a fascinating matchup between two guys who don't possess a ton of firepower but can do all kinds of unique things with the tennis ball. The edge goes to Brooksby simply because Moutet is coming off a long, grueling week in the district.Pick: Brooksby in 3    138WWW: Moutet vs. Brooksby?

The fifth-seeded Dane has not won a match since the Queen's Club second round. He lost in the quarterfinals to Roberto Bautista Agut and then squandered a two-set lead over Nicolas Jarry at Wimbledon.

A bad draw against Mpetshi Perricard may add to Rune's woes. The 6'8” Frenchman already has a match under his belt this week, having defeated Shintaro Mochizuki 6-4, 6-2 on Sunday. Mochizuki may not be the toughest of opponents, but breaking serve three times against anyone is encouraging for Mpetshi Perricard. Rune cannot be trusted given his lack of form and potential physical issues, so an upset for the world No. 43 would not be surprising.Pick: Mpetshi Perricard in 3    110WWW: Rune vs. Mpetshi Perricard?

Normally, maybe some possible fatigue from Moutet would be a factor, but this is Moutet we are talking about, far from your average player, his lefty game looks to cause Brooksby enough problems to go through, also leftiness helps mitigate fatigue, Moutet in 3, 1-6, 6-1, 7-6(9).

Correction Rune did not play Washington due to back pain, not an injury, though yes there are questions over how his back is feeling now, though it seems he's fine enough since he's playing, MP blasting serves at him all day in the blazing hot sun will likely test it well, Rune has only played one match since Queen's at Wimby, MP got him last year in Basel indoors, so MP has that going for him even though his overall form lately has been poor, MP in 3, 4-6, 7-6(1), 7-6(8).

Brooksby in three for the tiredness reason.
I had Rune , but on reflection, Perricard in three, slightly more faith in him which isn't much

Alexei Popyrin has a ‘Big Man Tennis' problem.

His natural high-octane game built around a massive serve, heavy firepower from the ground and ability to finish at net give him capabilities of which most players can only dream.

But when early-round losses begin to accumulate, can you throttle back to find consistency? And if you can, what is the opportunity cost?

These are the questions vexing the World No. 26 Australian as he enters perhaps the most critical part of his season. This time last year he bolted like a 50-1 Kentucky Derby outsider to win the ATP Masters 1000 title in Montreal and soon after stunned Novak Djokovic on Arthur Ashe Stadium in the third round of the US Open.

That wasn't done by playing conservatively. But sustaining that level has proven elusive.

""On a good day I feel that Alexei has one of the best serves on tour. It's tough to read and to return,” Daniil Medvedev told ATPTour.com. The Former World No. 1, who leads their Lexus ATP Head2Head series 4-1, is seeded to meet Popyrin in the third round of the National Bank Open in Toronto.

“He has great potential, like we saw in Montreal last year when his game was on fire. In matches where he doesn't miss it gets tricky. He can slice well and prepare for the strong forehand. But there have been matches when he misses a lot so you try to hang in there and try to win the match. Right now he can be too up and down.""

Popyrin, 25, is unlikely to dispute that frank assessment. Last year he was unable to convert the momentum he had coming out of the US Open, winning just three matches in his final four tournaments of the season. It should be noted, however, that he did beat Matteo Berrettini and Medvedev to reach the third round of the Rolex Paris Masters as he ended the year with a 28-22 record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.



Last week in Washington, Popyrin slipped to a 12-16 season record after his ninth opening-round loss of the year. While surely willing himself to a big run in Toronto, Popyrin will be mindful that his dream of a successful title defence starts with consistent performances in the early rounds.

“Against Novak, I think everybody always knew that I'm capable of producing a one-match stunner,” Popyrin said… “But I want to get back to winning the matches that I should be winning, stringing together wins and then giving a good account in the matches that I'm the underdog. Winning the Masters was easily a bigger buzz than the US Open win over Novak because I put together six matches consecutively against Top 20 opponents and beat them all.

“As you look for that consistency, you don't want to take away anything from your big explosive game; it's more about staying in rallies longer and waiting for the right opportunity rather than going for an unbelievable shot.”

One year on from his Montreal title, the bill has come due. Popyrin is No. 26 in the PIF ATP Rankings. But for a calendar shift related to Toronto's move to an expanded 12-day event, Popyrin would already have dropped his 1000 champion's points and be just outside the Top 50 of the PIF ATP Live Rankings.

“I'd be lying if I said there's no pressure [defending the Canada title],” he said. “Every year you have to go in defending points. This year is just a big chunk of points that go out because of an amazing result that happened the year before… Going into Toronto, I'm trying to not put too much pressure on myself and I know that once those points are off, I'll have like a little bit of a weight lifted off my shoulders.”

At 6' 5”, Popyrin has an advantage over most players his size: his movement. Coaches Neville Godwin and Wayne Ferreira (who joined the team in April) have helped the three-time ATP Tour champion realise that he doesn't need to force his way out of defence with one shot. He has the legs to dig in for the long haul and work back into a neutral position.

His fellow Australian Alex de Minaur, known as one of the game's elite movers, said Popyrin's court coverage was highly underrated. “For a big, tall guy Pop's movement is extremely good,” the recent Washington ATP 500 champion told ATPTour.com. “So he's got the ability to play a big brand of tennis and go after shots on his terms, but he's also got the ability to retrieve and defend with his legs, giving his opponents something else to think about.”

Popyrin was chuffed to hear De Minaur's praise when ATPTour.com sat down with him in Washington.

“People see me as tall and lanky, very uncoordinated, and think I might be a slow mover,” Popyrin said. “But I feel movement comes naturally to me, that I'm quite quick for a big guy and I can get out of corners quite easily. I definitely see it as a weapon of mine.”

Leading into the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters in April, Popyrin onboarded former World No. 6 Ferreira, who replaced Xavier Malisse in the dual coach setup with fellow South African Godwin.

While Popyrin says that both Godwin and Ferreira bring different strengths to the team, he insists on them first talking to each other before coming to him with a united voice.

“You've got two great tennis brains thinking about you, which is very beneficial,” he said. “But I prefer for them to agree on ideas before they bring them to me,” he said. “I like to get the same message from both coaches.

“I've had the dual coach set up for a while. Neville worked with Xavier Malisse for two years before and we went from being ranked 120 to Top 20, basically. Since Wayne came in, I feel like my year has been trending upwards. He's been a great addition. The start of the year was really difficult for me. But we were able to get over that hurdle.”

Off the court, Popyrin also feels he is on an upward trajectory as he looks ahead to his wedding to fiance Amy Pederick. The city and venue have been decided, but for now, they remain a secret.

“I've left all the planning to her,” he said. “She's done an unbelievable job. She's already found our venue, she's found the date. We're going to get married next year around September time. So it's something we're really looking forward to. We're definitely planning it. We're trying to get my sister over from Australia and the whole family to come and her whole family and our friends. It's something really exciting and something that we're both looking very forward to.”

Popyrin begins his title defence Tuesday in Toronto third match from 11 a.m. against 18-year-old Canadian wild card Nicolas Arseneault, who is making his main-draw Tour-level debut.

Andrey Rublev and Casper Ruud are best known for their bravery on the tennis court, but they showed Monday at the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers that they have plenty of it off the court, too.

The ATP Tour stars participated in a discussion at Tennis Canada's Mental Health Panel in Toronto to help break the stigma surrounding mental health in male athletes and its link to performance.

Ruud said: “I had good experience talking with a psychologist and I felt like you go to gym with a public trainer to work on your fitness, but talking to a psychologist is sort of like working on your mental aspect in the same way. You work out your brain in a [way] and get your thoughts sorted and find a new way to motivate yourself so I just found it really helpful. 

“I didn't want to be a voice, but it felt like a natural thing to talk about these days and that I wanted to advise people if you are struggling or if you have issues or feel like you're uncertain whether you should go talk to someone or not, I think it's definitely a good thing to try and it really helped for me.”

Rublev, who recently opened up about his struggles in a special ATP documentary, explained that for him, mental health is about far more than tennis.

“In my case it's not about tennis. Tennis for me was a trigger because I identified myself with tennis, so for me it was more about myself, to understand beyond tennis,” Rublev said. “[I wanted to know] what I'm hiding behind tennis, why I'm making so much drama when I'm losing or I'm super high when I'm winning. It was more to face myself, the real me. It was nothing to do with tennis.”



The host of the panel was Sportsnet's Caroline Cameron, and other participants were Tennis Canada Director of Wellness Marie-Josee Bellemare and ATP Coach member Craig Boynton, who detailed the changes in how mental health has been viewed in the sport over the years.

“In the ‘90s, this was a very taboo subject. It was that you didn't talk about mental health. If you did, it was a weakness. So it's been interesting to watch this progress throughout the decades,” Boynton said. “People would start to talk about it, but in the shadows. They would talk about it, but they would hold it tightly, because they didn't want to be judged. And then as life has progressed and these tennis players [have progressed, people] are talking about them as people. 

“They're wonderful people, and amazing tennis players, but you've got to take care of the person to help the tennis. It's gone from in the ‘90s all about tennis, just working on tennis, tennis. Now we work on the person and working on the person will then allow us to be able to work on the tennis… It's been an eye-opening experience for me just to sit back and watch this all unfold.""

Tennis Canada's mental health initiatives aim to foster awareness, promote healthy habits and ensure our tennis community has access to the mental health support they need.

Iga Swiatek is returning to action for the first time following her triumph at Wimbledon.

Swiatek broke her grass-court duck in early July, defeating Amanda Anisimova 6-0 6-0 in the Wimbledon final.

The 24-year-old now has six Grand Slam titles to her name, after winning four French Open crowns and one US Open.

The Polish star, who was recently named the best player this century, has returned to the hard courts this week, set on continuing her impressive form at the Canadian Open.

Ahead of her first match at the tournament, Swiatek described her thoughts and feelings regarding the importance of her Wimbledon triumph.

While speaking at her pre-tournament press conference in Montreal, Canada, Swiatek was asked to consider how much of a turning point her Wimbledon victory was in the grand scheme of her career.

Swiatek replied: “I think I'm too experienced to have like turning points you know because I already realised that, even when you win a Grand Slam, you just need to get back to work and, yeah, the hype is big, like, you can celebrate for a week, but then the season goes on, you know.

“So I would say for sure, I can take a lot from it in terms of like believing and also kind of not giving up because tennis can always surprise you if something positive, if you work hard enough.

“So, yeah, I have these kind of lessons in my mind, but I wouldn't call it like a turning point, you know. It's just another experience that you use in the future.”

At the Canadian Open, Swiatek is set to face Hanyu Guo in the second round, after the Chinese player defeated Yulia Puntiseva.

If she comes through that contest, Swiatek could set up a meeting with Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, who defeated Sonay Kartal at Wimbledon.

Swiatek has a huge opportunity to chase down those above her in the rankings: Coco Gauff and Aryna Sabalenka.

The Pole did not compete at the Canadian Open in 2024 due to fatigue, meaning she will be able to gain a significant number of WTA points if she goes far at this week's event.

Meanwhile, Aryna Sabalenka has withdrawn from the 2025 event, meaning she will lose the points gained from reaching the quarter-final stage in 2024.

Coco Gauff is in a similar, but not quite as precarious, situation. The American reached the third round at the 2024 Canadian Open, losing to Diana Shnaider.

Therefore, Gauff will likely have an opportunity to gain ground on Sabalenka. However, if she suffers another early shock in Canada, Iga Swiatek will have the opportunity to capitalise.

Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek has weighed in on Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner's differing approaches to the sport. The world No.3 is fresh off the sixth Grand Slam win of her career after cruising to victory over Amanda Anisimova at the All England Club.

Swiatek remarkably only dropped one set on her way to claiming her first Wimbledon title and has attributed part of her success to her hard-working mindset. Fellow Wimbledon champ Sinner can relate after declaring that “hard work beats talent” following his victory at SW19. However, Swiatek has confessed to taking inspiration from Alcaraz's more laid-back approach and commitment to enjoying his time away from the tennis court.

""I wish I was more like Carlos because I have got to say he is a big inspiration in terms of that,” Swiatek told TVA Sports. “He always says that the most important thing for him on a tennis court is to enjoy it and have fun and I sometimes forget about that.

“And sometimes with all the pressure around and things we need to do off the court, you need to remind yourself about this kid that started playing tennis, instead of winning for somebody and having this baggage on your shoulders.

“For sure, when Carlos shows that and when he speaks about that, it is always a good reminder for me, and I try to do that as well, but without me working on it, I think my mind would automatically go to just working, working, working.""

Alcaraz notably embarked on a short trip to Ibiza in June after defeating Sinner in their unforgettable French Open final. While other top players would not consider taking a holiday at such a crucial time in the tennis calendar, it had been Alcaraz's preparation ahead of his two previous Wimbledon wins. This year, he won Queen's upon his return and reached the Wimbledon final.

Sinner adopts a more focused approach than his rival. When asked about the secret behind his success after claiming his fourth Grand Slam title, Sinner said: ""I always say that hard work beats talent. And that's what I try to do.

“I always go on a practice court with a purpose, and I believe that the mindset you start to build in practice sessions, when you struggle, when you have pain, when you at times don't want to practice, but you still go and you still do everything possible to make it a good day. If you cannot do it in practice sessions, then you cannot do it in the real matches.""



Meanwhile, Swiatek is focused on extending her success at the Canadian Open as she prepares to face Guo Hanyu in the second round on Wednesday. The 24-year-old has had time to reflect on her Wimbledon win and how it compares to her previous triumphs.

“For sure, winning Wimbledon is something special. I think it was much different because I just haven't expected it,” Swiatek said. “I didn't feel the relief as I did at Roland Garros because everyone was expecting me to win.

“I just felt super proud of myself. I thought that tennis can still surprise me and it was all so refreshing. That's why I'm super happy because it wasn't on my list this year to win Wimbledon and it happened. So I really enjoyed this feeling and try to keep it for as long as possible with me.""

Grigor Dimitrov's incredible 58 consecutive Grand Slams comes to an end with US Open absence due to pectoral injury suffered at Wimbledon; The US Open is live on Sky Sports Tennis and Sky Sports+, streaming service NOW and the Sky Sports app from August 24

Tuesday 29 July 2025 17:23, UK

Grigor Dimitrov will miss the US Open due to the pectoral injury he suffered in devastating fashion against world No 1 Jannik Sinner at Wimbledon.

The 34-year-old was two sets up against eventual winner Jannik Sinner in the fourth round at the grass major before having to retire due to a partial tear of his right pectoral muscle.

It means Dimitrov's incredible run of 58 consecutive Grand Slams - since the 2011 Australian Open - will come to an end.

Dimitrov sent a heart-warming message to fans via social media after undergoing surgery.

""Sometimes the heart wants to keep going… but the universe has a different plan for us,"" wrote Dimitrov in a post on Instagram, which included a photo of himself in a hospital bed.

""Having to withdraw from this match at Wimbledon was one of the most painful moments of my career.

""Thank you for the overwhelming wave of love - from family, friends, fans, colleagues, to the entire tennis community… your messages have genuinely lifted me through these hard times. Thank you all. Truly. Recovery starts now. I'll see you all soon. G.""

Last year, the former world No 3 reached the quarter-finals of the US Open, but wound up having to withdraw in the fourth set while down 4-1 against American Frances Tiafoe due to a groin injury.

The 2017 Nitto ATP Finals champion's withdrawal marked the second of what would be five straight retirements in Grand Slam matches he has retired due to injury, including at January's Australian Open (groin), May at the French Open (leg) and he will now miss the trip to New York due to the pectoral injury.

Dimitrov's first tournament back could be the China Open, set to take place in Beijing from September 25 to October 1 - live on Sky Sports Tennis.

Ben Shelton has soared to No. 7 in the world ATP rankings, marking a career-high position for the rising star while establishing himself as the second-highest-ranked American in men's tennis since 2011.

The powerful-serving American delivered several unforgettable moments at Wimbledon during an outstanding run before succumbing to eventual champion Jannik Sinner in the quarterfinals. Building on that momentum, he'll be eager to advance deeper at the U.S. Open in August following his semifinal appearance in 2023.

However, his recent displays have been sufficient to propel him to world No. 7, making him the second American male player alongside Taylor Fritz, who reached the Wimbledon semifinal (currently world No. 4), to achieve such heights.

Mardy Fish was the previous American to crack the men's top seven rankings, way back in 2011, after he also advanced to the Wimbledon quarterfinals - his career pinnacle.

At just 22, Shelton has already surpassed achievements that eluded Fish during his career, while accumulating greater career prize money than the cherished player, who has since retired. Shelton would have felt frustrated to depart Wimbledon at that stage, appearing to possess considerable momentum following several impressive showings.



Nevertheless, after his elimination, he demonstrated his modesty while declaring that he wouldn't allow the defeat to impact him going forward, with the U.S. Open approaching rapidly. He told reporters: ""Feeling more comfortable on grass, for sure.

""The way I'm moving, the way I'm returning, hitting the ball from the ground, it's better. It's not where I want to be, but I have six weeks to do everything humanly possible to be ready and better at the U.S. Open.""

He added: ""It's my favorite tournament of the year, and I go after it.""

Should Shelton ever claim a Grand Slam title, he understands he'll need to overcome the likes of Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, who are both his contemporaries. The trio are expected to battle it out as primary competitors throughout the coming decade.

Shelton holds a 0-3 record against Alcaraz while managing just 1-6 against Sinner, with both players already building arguments as potentially among the most gifted athletes in tennis history.

Discussing his matchups with Sinner, Shelton confessed: ""It's frustrating. There's a lot of things. It's two very different players and challenges. With Sinner who I've played the most, his ball speed is really high. I've never seen anything like it. You don't see anything like it when you're going through the draw.

""When you play him it's almost like things are in 2x speed. I'm usually pretty good at adjusting to that speed. It's difficult when a guy is hitting the ball that big that consistently off both wings and serving the way he is. I had the right idea for a lot of the match today.""

The U.S. Open is scheduled to commence on August 24.

Earlier this month, it was reported that Wimbledon would generate “more than half a billion dollars in revenue” for the 2025 edition. The grass major has turned into a guaranteed, money minting machine for the All England Club. It becomes evident from the fact that last year's event pulled in an estimated $555 million. With the nearly 150-year-old tournament becoming a force to reckon with, it was obvious for the organizers to consider expansion. And the massive plan, amounting to $270 million, finally got a much-needed green light to set things in motion. However, it seems like the future dream will come at a cost. Speaking of which, a renowned figure has now expressed his unfiltered thoughts.

Wimbledon's huge expansion plan was first revealed several years ago. Interestingly, the expansion aims to triple Wimbledon's footprint. The overhaul will see the addition of a new 8,000-seat stadium on the grounds of previous Wimbledon Park Golf Club. Not to mention the construction of 39 new courts. This way, even the qualifying rounds will be held inside the Wimbledon area. So far, they have taken place in South London at Roehampton. But, the potential expansion has become a subject of scrutiny, with opposition rallying strong through the Save Wimbledon Park campaign.

Sharing his views on the expansion project, insider Jon Wertheim made his stance very clear on Andy Roddick's Served podcast. He began, “I am kind of fascinated by this whole topic. But for a while, one of my takes on Wimbledon was, ‘How much money they passed up and they didn't get into the naming rights game and they didn't have so many sponsors, and you don't see the back walls plastered.' And all of a sudden, this looks like pretty savvy move from a business perspective. I mean this event is going to absolutely change.” Additionally, he also pointed out the timeline regarding the project's completion. “This isn't gonna happen tomorrow. I mean they are talking early 2030s.”

He admired how the grass major has been the center of attraction for years now. “One of these bucket list experiences but it's pretty crowded. And if there's a way to allow more people to experience Wimbledon, people are spending the night camping out on a field in order to experience this. If this (expansion) creates more opportunities for people to enjoy Wimbledon. I mean, obviously, the bigger picture for tennis is, this fits into some of the arms race among the four majors. And I think Wimbledon's going to lurch significantly ahead now.”

On top of that, this time, Wimbledon experienced its hottest ever-star. Spectators who were camping outside felt a need for seeking a shade and were constantly reaching for water bottles. Hence, with the construction of more courts at the SW19, the authorities are also looking to provide better amenities to people in order to beat the oppressive heat. Wertheim mentioned, “I mean not just in terms of square footage but also just amenities now and the hospitality picture will change and the fact that the qualifying rounds will be on site will turn this into a three-week event the way US Open is. And also I think this is just another indication that the four majors are really the coins of the realm for tennis.” After the planned development, it will be “a three-week tournament basically.”

But what about the locals residing in the nearby area? Especially the location where the dream project will take place. Wertheim knows it will be a huge challenge “for the neighbors who are very unhappy about this.” For the next few years, “they're going to have dump trucks outside their house for the next five years.” However, there's the other side too. Which is? “I think, sort of big picture, it's good for Wimbledon, it's good for the common fan. Not just for balance sheets but the average fan will now have a lot more opportunity to experience Wimbledon. I think it's kind of inevitable.”

Wertheim commended the Wimbledon's magic that still captivates millions of fans. Per him, “the trick Wimbledon seems to master so well, the needle thread, is keeping the tradition, keeping everything that's special but also growing with the times.”

This year's edition was a huge success. But guess what? the 2025 grass major had its fair share of controversial moments too.

For the uninitiated, this year's edition saw no actual line judges. The electronic line calling (ELC) technology was at the forefront instead. While it was expected to alleviate human errors, the results weren't that positive to say the least. For example, during the QF encounter between Taylor Fritz and Karen Khachanov, a call was made mid-point. That, too, when the ball had landed inside the baseline. As a result, the chair umpire had to replay the point.

Later, the event came up with a statement on this blunder. “The player's service motion began while the BBG (ball boys and girls) was still crossing the net and therefore the system didn't recognize the start of the point. As such, the Chair Umpire instructed the point be replayed.” But this wasn't the only case featuring technology's fault in giving accurate verdicts.

On the WTA side, even Emma Raducanu and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova called out the ELC. Remember the Brit's reaction after losing the third round match against Aryna Sabalenka? During the press conference, she didn't mince her words. “I mean that call that was like for sure out. It's kind of, you know, disappointing, you know, the tournament here that the calls can be so wrong, but you know, for the most part, they've been okay,” she said.

Her frustration was due to a call made midway in the first set. Sabalenka made a serve at 2-4, 15-0. Per the Brit, it was out but ELC termed it in. Emma Raducanu even approached the chair umpire saying, “You saw it out as well, right?”

It will be interesting to see how the ELC evolves going forward. Do you think it will get better by the next edition to offer “maximum accuracy”? Let us know in the comments below.

Venus Williams discusses her singles win against Peyton Stearns at the Washington Open. (0:59)

NEW YORK -- Venus Williams' comeback is headed to the US Open next month, when she will enter the redesigned mixed doubles tournament with Reilly Opelka via a wild-card entry.

Williams, 45, who returned to the tennis tour last week after more than a year away, and Opelka were among the 14 teams announced Tuesday by the U.S. Tennis Association for its mixed doubles event Aug. 19-20.

Eight of the pairings received direct entry into the field based on having the highest combined current singles rankings, and six were given wild cards by the USTA.

The players with spots in the bracket include nine who have won at least one Grand Slam singles title and 14 who are ranked in the WTA or ATP top 10 for singles.

The eight duos with direct entry are No. 11 Emma Navarro and No. 1 Jannik Sinner; No. 10 Paula Badosa and No. 5 Jack Draper; No. 3 Iga Swiatek and No. 13 Casper Ruud; No. 12 Elena Rybakina and No. 4 Taylor Fritz; No. 7 Amanda Anisimova and No. 9 Holger Rune; Belinda Bencic and No. 3 Alexander Zverev; No. 4 Jessica Pegula and No. 15 Tommy Paul; No. 5 Mirra Andreeva and No. 14 Daniil Medvedev.

Badosa originally had sought a place in the field with Stefanos Tsitsipas, while Draper initially was going to play alongside Zheng Qinwen.

In addition to Williams-Opelka, the wild-card entrants are Emma Raducanu and No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz; No. 8 Madison Keys and Frances Tiafoe; Olga Danilovic and No. 6 Novak Djokovic; Taylor Townsend and No. 7 Ben Shelton; and last year's US Open mixed doubles champions, Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori.

A total of 16 duos will be competing for the $1 million top prize; the last two wild-card pairs will be known at a later date.

It is still possible that Williams will ask for, and receive, a wild-card entry for singles. Those are expected to be announced by the USTA the week of Aug. 11.

She won one match each in singles and doubles at the D.C. Open in Washington last week after not competing anywhere since the Miami Open in March 2024. She was also awarded a wild-card entry last week for next month's Cincinnati Open.

Williams owns seven Grand Slam titles in singles, 14 in women's doubles -- all won with her younger sister Serena -- and two in mixed doubles.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","tennis"

Grigor Dimitrov's incredible 58 consecutive Grand Slams comes to an end with US Open absence due to pectoral injury suffered at Wimbledon; The US Open is live on Sky Sports Tennis and Sky Sports+, streaming service NOW and the Sky Sports app from August 24

Tuesday 29 July 2025 17:23, UK

Grigor Dimitrov will miss the US Open due to the pectoral injury he suffered in devastating fashion against world No 1 Jannik Sinner at Wimbledon.

The 34-year-old was two sets up against eventual winner Jannik Sinner in the fourth round at the grass major before having to retire due to a partial tear of his right pectoral muscle.

It means Dimitrov's incredible run of 58 consecutive Grand Slams - since the 2011 Australian Open - will come to an end.

Dimitrov sent a heart-warming message to fans via social media after undergoing surgery.

""Sometimes the heart wants to keep going… but the universe has a different plan for us,"" wrote Dimitrov in a post on Instagram, which included a photo of himself in a hospital bed.

""Having to withdraw from this match at Wimbledon was one of the most painful moments of my career.

""Thank you for the overwhelming wave of love - from family, friends, fans, colleagues, to the entire tennis community… your messages have genuinely lifted me through these hard times. Thank you all. Truly. Recovery starts now. I'll see you all soon. G.""

Last year, the former world No 3 reached the quarter-finals of the US Open, but wound up having to withdraw in the fourth set while down 4-1 against American Frances Tiafoe due to a groin injury.

The 2017 Nitto ATP Finals champion's withdrawal marked the second of what would be five straight retirements in Grand Slam matches he has retired due to injury, including at January's Australian Open (groin), May at the French Open (leg) and he will now miss the trip to New York due to the pectoral injury.

Dimitrov's first tournament back could be the China Open, set to take place in Beijing from September 25 to October 1 - live on Sky Sports Tennis.

A run of 58 consecutive grand slam appearances for Grigor Dimitrov will shortly come to an end after his manager confirmed he will miss the upcoming US Open.

Since the 2011 Australian Open, the name Dimitrov has featured on every men's singles entry list but the Bulgarian will be missing from the American slam next month due to an injury he picked up at Wimbledon.

The 34-year-old was two sets up against eventual winner Jannik Sinner before having to retire due to a partial tear of his right pectoralis major muscle.

But the No.20 has been unable to recover in time for the upcoming slam and his manager Georgi Stoimenov told TennisKafe that Dimitrov will be sitting out of the tournament.

The hope is that he will be fit for the tournaments in China in late September but that could sitll change.

Dimitrov's injury means his consecutive slam streak ends at 58, which is a record amongst the active players.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=australian+open+tennis","Madison Keys vs Laura Siegemund Canadian Open Preview — Head-to-Head and Prediction","https://www.profootballnetwork.com/tennis/madison-keys-vs-laura-siegemund-canadian-open-preview-head-to-head-and-prediction/","Tue, 29 Jul 2025 15:50:41 GMT","

Madison Keys is set to kick off her North American hard-court swing at the 2025 Canadian Open. The American, seeded sixth, received a bye into the second round, where she will take on World No. 54 Laura Siegemund.

Keys began the season on a high, claiming titles in Adelaide and winning her first Major title at the Australian Open. She followed that up with a semifinal run at Indian Wells. Although she hasn't lifted a trophy since Melbourne, she has continued to post strong results, including quarterfinal appearances in Madrid and Roland Garros, along with a semifinal finish at the Queen's Club Championships in London.

The American last appeared at the 2025 Wimbledon Championships, and her campaign ended earlier than expected. She battled past Elena-Gabriela Ruse 6-7(7), 7-5, 7-5, and defeated Olga Danilović 6-4, 6-2 to reach the third round, only to be ousted by Siegemund 6-3, 6-3.

Having skipped the Mubadala Citi DC Open, Keys will now be looking to avenge that Wimbledon loss when she meets Siegemund again in the second round of the Canadian Open.

But the German has had a starkly contrasting singles run in 2025, marred by a series of early exits. She couldn't even make it past the qualifying rounds in Adelaide, Doha, Indian Wells, Miami, and Madrid. Her grass-court season began no better, with opening-round losses in Nottingham and Bad Homburg, but turned the tide at Wimbledon, her most recent tournament. The 37-year-old reached the quarterfinals, where she lost to the World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka.

Siegemund, too, will begin her North American hard-court swing in Canada, eyeing momentum in her road to the US Open.

The Canadian Open sets up a second consecutive showdown between Keys and Siegemund this season, with the German holding a 2-1 lead in their head-to-head. Interestingly, their meeting at the 2025 Wimbledon Championships was their first in nearly nine years.

Before that, the two had faced each other in the first round of the 2016 Wimbledon Championships.

Both players will be looking to rediscover their rhythm and build momentum ahead of the US Open. Keys, who holds a respectable 32-10 win-loss record this season, will aim to back up her powerful serve with sharper form when she faces Siegemund in the second round.

 

“Siegemund stuns Keys.” 🤯

— Wimbledon (@Wimbledon) July 4, 2025



Keys has been more efficient on serve this season, winning 67.8% of her first-serve points and converting 75% of her service games. Siegemund, by comparison, stands at 61% and 66.7%, respectively. The German, with a 14-16 win-loss record in 2025, also trails in break point conversion, 37.8% to Keys' 43.7%.

Adding to Keys' advantage is her overall win percentage of 63.2% on hard courts, which is quite ahead of the German's 50.9%. Thus, the seeding, overall record and current form puts the American slightly ahead of the German.

Pick: Keys to win in three sets.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Balance of power: Why Alexei Popyrin isn't looking for 'tradeoff tennis'","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/alexei-popyrin-balance-of-power-2025","Tue, 29 Jul 2025 01:40:40 GMT","

Alexei Popyrin has a ‘Big Man Tennis' problem.

His natural high-octane game built around a massive serve, heavy firepower from the ground and ability to finish at net give him capabilities of which most players can only dream.

But when early-round losses begin to accumulate, can you throttle back to find consistency? And if you can, what is the opportunity cost?

These are the questions vexing the World No. 26 Australian as he enters perhaps the most critical part of his season. This time last year he bolted like a 50-1 Kentucky Derby outsider to win the ATP Masters 1000 title in Montreal and soon after stunned Novak Djokovic on Arthur Ashe Stadium in the third round of the US Open.

That wasn't done by playing conservatively. But sustaining that level has proven elusive.

""On a good day I feel that Alexei has one of the best serves on tour. It's tough to read and to return,” Daniil Medvedev told ATPTour.com. The Former World No. 1, who leads their Lexus ATP Head2Head series 4-1, is seeded to meet Popyrin in the third round of the National Bank Open in Toronto.

“He has great potential, like we saw in Montreal last year when his game was on fire. In matches where he doesn't miss it gets tricky. He can slice well and prepare for the strong forehand. But there have been matches when he misses a lot so you try to hang in there and try to win the match. Right now he can be too up and down.""

Popyrin, 25, is unlikely to dispute that frank assessment. Last year he was unable to convert the momentum he had coming out of the US Open, winning just three matches in his final four tournaments of the season. It should be noted, however, that he did beat Matteo Berrettini and Medvedev to reach the third round of the Rolex Paris Masters as he ended the year with a 28-22 record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.



Last week in Washington, Popyrin slipped to a 12-16 season record after his ninth opening-round loss of the year. While surely willing himself to a big run in Toronto, Popyrin will be mindful that his dream of a successful title defence starts with consistent performances in the early rounds.

“Against Novak, I think everybody always knew that I'm capable of producing a one-match stunner,” Popyrin said… “But I want to get back to winning the matches that I should be winning, stringing together wins and then giving a good account in the matches that I'm the underdog. Winning the Masters was easily a bigger buzz than the US Open win over Novak because I put together six matches consecutively against Top 20 opponents and beat them all.

“As you look for that consistency, you don't want to take away anything from your big explosive game; it's more about staying in rallies longer and waiting for the right opportunity rather than going for an unbelievable shot.”

One year on from his Montreal title, the bill has come due. Popyrin is No. 26 in the PIF ATP Rankings. But for a calendar shift related to Toronto's move to an expanded 12-day event, Popyrin would already have dropped his 1000 champion's points and be just outside the Top 50 of the PIF ATP Live Rankings.

“I'd be lying if I said there's no pressure [defending the Canada title],” he said. “Every year you have to go in defending points. This year is just a big chunk of points that go out because of an amazing result that happened the year before… Going into Toronto, I'm trying to not put too much pressure on myself and I know that once those points are off, I'll have like a little bit of a weight lifted off my shoulders.”

At 6' 5”, Popyrin has an advantage over most players his size: his movement. Coaches Neville Godwin and Wayne Ferreira (who joined the team in April) have helped the three-time ATP Tour champion realise that he doesn't need to force his way out of defence with one shot. He has the legs to dig in for the long haul and work back into a neutral position.

His fellow Australian Alex de Minaur, known as one of the game's elite movers, said Popyrin's court coverage was highly underrated. “For a big, tall guy Pop's movement is extremely good,” the recent Washington ATP 500 champion told ATPTour.com. “So he's got the ability to play a big brand of tennis and go after shots on his terms, but he's also got the ability to retrieve and defend with his legs, giving his opponents something else to think about.”

Popyrin was chuffed to hear De Minaur's praise when ATPTour.com sat down with him in Washington.

“People see me as tall and lanky, very uncoordinated, and think I might be a slow mover,” Popyrin said. “But I feel movement comes naturally to me, that I'm quite quick for a big guy and I can get out of corners quite easily. I definitely see it as a weapon of mine.”

Leading into the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters in April, Popyrin onboarded former World No. 6 Ferreira, who replaced Xavier Malisse in the dual coach setup with fellow South African Godwin.

While Popyrin says that both Godwin and Ferreira bring different strengths to the team, he insists on them first talking to each other before coming to him with a united voice.

“You've got two great tennis brains thinking about you, which is very beneficial,” he said. “But I prefer for them to agree on ideas before they bring them to me,” he said. “I like to get the same message from both coaches.

“I've had the dual coach set up for a while. Neville worked with Xavier Malisse for two years before and we went from being ranked 120 to Top 20, basically. Since Wayne came in, I feel like my year has been trending upwards. He's been a great addition. The start of the year was really difficult for me. But we were able to get over that hurdle.”

Off the court, Popyrin also feels he is on an upward trajectory as he looks ahead to his wedding to fiance Amy Pederick. The city and venue have been decided, but for now, they remain a secret.

“I've left all the planning to her,” he said. “She's done an unbelievable job. She's already found our venue, she's found the date. We're going to get married next year around September time. So it's something we're really looking forward to. We're definitely planning it. We're trying to get my sister over from Australia and the whole family to come and her whole family and our friends. It's something really exciting and something that we're both looking very forward to.”

Popyrin begins his title defence Tuesday in Toronto third match from 11 a.m. against 18-year-old Canadian wild card Nicolas Arseneault, who is making his main-draw Tour-level debut.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Rublev, Ruud reflect on mental health in special Toronto panel","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/toronto-2025-mental-health","Tue, 29 Jul 2025 02:55:40 GMT","

Andrey Rublev and Casper Ruud are best known for their bravery on the tennis court, but they showed Monday at the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers that they have plenty of it off the court, too.

The ATP Tour stars participated in a discussion at Tennis Canada's Mental Health Panel in Toronto to help break the stigma surrounding mental health in male athletes and its link to performance.

Ruud said: “I had good experience talking with a psychologist and I felt like you go to gym with a public trainer to work on your fitness, but talking to a psychologist is sort of like working on your mental aspect in the same way. You work out your brain in a [way] and get your thoughts sorted and find a new way to motivate yourself so I just found it really helpful. 

“I didn't want to be a voice, but it felt like a natural thing to talk about these days and that I wanted to advise people if you are struggling or if you have issues or feel like you're uncertain whether you should go talk to someone or not, I think it's definitely a good thing to try and it really helped for me.”

Rublev, who recently opened up about his struggles in a special ATP documentary, explained that for him, mental health is about far more than tennis.

“In my case it's not about tennis. Tennis for me was a trigger because I identified myself with tennis, so for me it was more about myself, to understand beyond tennis,” Rublev said. “[I wanted to know] what I'm hiding behind tennis, why I'm making so much drama when I'm losing or I'm super high when I'm winning. It was more to face myself, the real me. It was nothing to do with tennis.”



The host of the panel was Sportsnet's Caroline Cameron, and other participants were Tennis Canada Director of Wellness Marie-Josee Bellemare and ATP Coach member Craig Boynton, who detailed the changes in how mental health has been viewed in the sport over the years.

“In the ‘90s, this was a very taboo subject. It was that you didn't talk about mental health. If you did, it was a weakness. So it's been interesting to watch this progress throughout the decades,” Boynton said. “People would start to talk about it, but in the shadows. They would talk about it, but they would hold it tightly, because they didn't want to be judged. And then as life has progressed and these tennis players [have progressed, people] are talking about them as people. 

“They're wonderful people, and amazing tennis players, but you've got to take care of the person to help the tennis. It's gone from in the ‘90s all about tennis, just working on tennis, tennis. Now we work on the person and working on the person will then allow us to be able to work on the tennis… It's been an eye-opening experience for me just to sit back and watch this all unfold.""

Tennis Canada's mental health initiatives aim to foster awareness, promote healthy habits and ensure our tennis community has access to the mental health support they need.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Piastri's Perfect Pass in Belgium

Radio Rewind: 2025 Belgian Grand Prix

Lewis Hamilton admitted the Belgian Grand Prix weekend was one to forget, but were their glimpses of better to come for the Ferrari driver?

On the surface, Lewis Hamilton endured a challenging Belgian Grand Prix weekend in the upgraded Ferrari – but there were signs of promise beneath.

The seven-time World Champion spun out of SQ1 in Friday's Sprint Qualifying, before finishing Saturday's Sprint way down the field and then exited in Q1 of Grand Prix Qualifying later that same day. This was due to the deletion of his Q1 lap for track limits.

Rather than line up 16th on the grid, Ferrari elected to start him from the pit lane and, in that way, were able to switch him to a higher-downforce rear wing in anticipation of the forecasted rain.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Piastri's Perfect Pass in Belgium

Radio Rewind: 2025 Belgian Grand Prix

Yuki Tsunoda gives his take on his Belgian Grand Prix experience from Spa-Francorchamps.

Yuki Tsunoda was unable to capitalise on his best Qualifying result of the season for Red Bull as his Belgian Grand Prix unraveled following a ""miscommunication"" and strategy error.

The Red Bull man qualified seventh and was running in that position at the start of the race – an event that marked his 100th Grand Prix start – but he wound up finishing a frustrating P13 on a day where points seemed possible for the Japanese racer, who remains without a score since Imola back in May.

Tsunoda's race suffered a significant blow in the first pit stop period as, with the track drying, a small handful of drivers gambled and came in to swap to slick tyres. That proved to be the right call, prompting the majority to pit on the next lap.

However, Tsunoda – and a small handful of others – stayed out one further lap, which given the length of the Spa-Francorchamps circuit, proved to be very costly. When the Red Bull racer pitted, he tumbled from P7 to 12th and found himself in a DRS train behind Pierre Gasly's Alpine.

“There was a miscommunication I guess between myself and the team,” Tsunoda explained after the race. “I requested to switch to the dry tyre, they called me way too late, I unfortunately had just passed the pit entry when they called me.

“One lap in these kinds of conditions is very decisive; I lost five positions and was stuck behind a bit all the race. That's it, that was my race.”

Tsunoda fought hard to make it back to P11 and had DRS at times in his quest to overtake Gasly, but running in the dirty air for so long also cost him tyre wear, and he was picked off late on by both Ollie Bearman in the Haas and a much fresher-shod Nico Hulkenberg.

“I tried my best to overtake but unfortunately my straight-line speed was nowhere,” he added. ""I requested to – well I tried my best to – overtake but my tyre was gone so it was frustrating.

“Overall, a frustrating race and disappointing not to be in the points. There are definitely a couple of things that we can take away from the race and we will re-focus for Budapest next weekend.”

Tsunoda remains under pressure to put together some strong results – since joining Red Bull, he has one ninth and two P10 finishes in the 11 Grands Prix he has contested with the team, plus a few points from finishing P6 in the Sprint in Miami.

Belgium initially looked like it might be a turning point for Tsunoda, who on Saturday finally received the same package of upgrades that Max Verstappen has been running. But sadly, his best Qualifying of the year and first Q3 showing since Miami did not result in any score.

Tsunoda remains 17th in the Drivers' Championship standings with 10 points in total, with the upcoming Hungarian Grand Prix the final race weekend before the summer break.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Piastri's Perfect Pass in Belgium

Radio Rewind: 2025 Belgian Grand Prix

With the Belgian Grand Prix all wrapped, here are some more off-track and on-track moments you may have missed...

Oscar Piastri bagged his sixth Grand Prix victory of the 2025 season, beating team mate and title rival Lando Norris to win in Belgium, as the on-track action between the McLaren pair kept people gripped.

But there was also plenty going on in Spa off the track too. Here's a round-up of five things you might have missed across the Belgian Grand Prix weekend...

The moment many F1 fans have been waiting for finally happened ahead of the race on Sunday when Oscar Piastri's mum Nicole met her ‘adopted son' Yuki Tsunoda.

Yuki gave her a signed No.22 cap, with Nicole gushing: ""I just think you are fantastic, a really good person… Backing my boys!""

“My boys” jokingly refers to both Red Bull's Yuki and Drivers' Championship leader Oscar.

That all started a year ago when Oscar joked on X (formerly Twitter) he was hoping to find some Monegasque roots, with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc offering to adopt him in response.

Across that weekend F1 even changed Oscar's name on the free practice standings to ‘Oscar Piastri-Leclerc'.

Nicole's response was to post: ""It appears there's a vacancy for a son in my family, @yukitsunoda07?"" And she has subsequently been spotted wearing Tsunoda merchandise from then on.

Her dream weekend in Belgium was completed when her actual son Oscar stormed to victory in Sunday's race to extend his championship lead.

The Piastri family were out in force at Spa, with Oscar's grandfather attending his first race outside of Australia.

After his victory, Oscar wrote this message on the winning champagne bottle: “To Grandad. I guess you need to come to races more often too!”

The McLaren man explained afterwards: “One of my sisters, in Spain, that was her first race outside of Australia, and that was a good weekend. Now my grandfather [is] the same, so maybe I need to get my family members one by one for the rest of the races!”

Would you like your F1 titles with a little extra Hans Zimmer sauce?

Fans tuning in for the Belgian Grand Prix were greeted by the F1 The Movie soundtrack song 'F1' accompanying the usual title sequence – which you can enjoy in the video below!

Zimmer, a twice Oscar-winning legendary composer, spent time talking to seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton to understand what it's like driving an F1 car before he wrote his score for F1 The Movie. “It's dangerous, yet incredibly elegant,” he said.

Those devoted to Brian Tyler's epic F1 theme need not fear: it will be back!

Have you ever seen a chequered flag waved with such panache?

The sharp-dressed gentleman was 80-year-old Jacky Ickx, Belgium's finest F1 racer and twice a runner-up in the World Championship.

Ickx has eight F1 wins to his name – coincidentally the exact same number as all three drivers on the podium on Sunday have, Oscar Piastri, Lando Norris and Charles Leclerc.

Real Madrid and Belgium goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois also got the honour of waving the flag to finish the Sprint on Saturday, and was a little more cautious in his approach!

Did you know you can get your name on a square of the chequered flag, and then own that square after it has been waved? Well now you do…! Find out more

British comedian and presenter, Amelia Dimoldenberg, was among the celebrities who enjoyed a weekend at Spa.

It's not Amelia's first brush with F1, with Lando Norris featuring on her YouTube series ‘Chicken Shop Dates' last year.

During a six-minute (deliberately!) awkward encounter, Amelia got Lando's advice on how to pass her driving theory test; before pointedly making reference to the fact her fellow Brit had yet to win an F1 race.

Just 44 days after the episode was published, Lando broke his duck at the Miami Grand Prix, the first of eight victories for McLaren since.

Dimoldenberg was spotted in the Haas garage in Belgium though – and is it a coincidence that Esteban Ocon and Oliver Bearman both finished in the points in the Sprint? (Yes, probably).

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Piastri's Perfect Pass in Belgium

Radio Rewind: 2025 Belgian Grand Prix

Oscar Piastri got back to winning ways in Belgium, but who else made their mark across the Sprint weekend in Spa?

Oscar Piastri returned to winning ways as he pounced on McLaren team mate Lando Norris on the first racing lap of the Belgian Grand Prix to seal victory. But while the Australian had plenty to celebrate, many of his rivals were left wondering what might have been in a wet-dry race at Spa...

Piastri arrived at Spa on a run of three Grand Prix weekends without a win – the longest stretch he's endured so far this season – and having been beaten by Norris in each of the last two rounds.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Piastri's Perfect Pass in Belgium

Radio Rewind: 2025 Belgian Grand Prix

Find out who impressed our judges with their performances at the Belgian Grand Prix.

On a weekend where Spa-Francorchamps was engulfed in both bright sunshine and heavy rain, Oscar Piastri came out on top and extended his points lead over McLaren team mate Lando Norris. But how did our Power Rankings list for the weekend shake out? Check out the latest scores and overall leaderboard below...

Having missed out on victory in the Sprint from pole, Piastri stamped his authority on Sunday's Grand Prix and instantly went on the attack, taking the lead on the first lap of racing from team mate Norris. Having extended his lead to 9.1s through the sole pit stop sequence for dry tyres, the Australian rattled off consistent lap times on the medium Pirelli rubber for his sixth win of the season and extended his championship lead to 16 points. Our judges were suitably impressed.

A scintillating final Qualifying lap vaulted Albon's Williams up to fifth for the Grand Prix, making up for a tricky Sprint where he finished outside the top 10, having been hampered by a power unit issue. Having lost a position to Russell's Mercedes in the early wet running, Albon settled into a rhythm and was able to keep Hamilton's faster Ferrari behind thanks to a superior straightline advantage which yielded sixth at the chequered flag.

Leclerc was best of the rest on Sunday after qualifying third behind the McLaren duo and maintained the net-position through the pit stop sequence having superbly kept Verstappen behind when his Ferrari's intermediate tyres were shot. He never stretched his advantage over the Dutchman to more than a handful of seconds, but showed Ferrari's new suspension package was a step forward for the Scuderia.

Verstappen gambled on a low-downforce set-up for Saturday's Sprint, which yielded P2 on the grid, before snatching the lead from poleman Piastri on the run to Les Combes before hanging on against the faster McLarens. Only able to grab fourth for the Grand Prix with more downforce applied and despite his best efforts, the four-time and reigning World Champion was unable to find his way around Leclerc's Ferrari.

Made it through to Q2 despite the Alpine's poor straightline speed performance and, after starting P13, grimly led a DRS train for much of the 44-lap race on the fringes of the top 10. Having held Tsunoda's Red Bull and the Haas of Bearman at bay throughout, the Frenchman was rewarded with a point having been promoted to 10th when Hulkenberg's Kick Sauber ahead stopped for a second time.

Secured his third points finish from the last six races after largely going under the radar in Belgium, finishing 10th in the Sprint and qualifying ninth for the Grand Prix, both times behind Racing Bulls team mate Hadjar. But while the Frenchman was forced to make a second pit stop for tyres that relegated him to the back of the field in the race, Lawson quietly went about his business to finish P8.

Was left to follow Verstappen and Piastri home in the Sprint but made amends with a Grand Prix pole position. Despite being helped by a rolling start and clear vision once action got underway on Sunday, the McLaren man was unable to prevent Piastri from overtaking along the Kemmel Straight. Pitting a lap later and for the hard tyre meant Norris had a mountain to climb, with several small mistakes ultimately consigning him to second.

The Brazilian's impressive run of form continued in Belgium as he secured his second points finish from three races after finishing P9. Made it through to Q3, out-qualifying Kick Sauber team mate Hulkenberg again, and showed more pace than the German as he was allowed to move ahead after falling behind in the early laps. Thereafter, he kept out of trouble and followed Lawson home but well clear of Gasly.

A spin and then losing his best lap time to track limits in both the Sprint and Grand Prix Qualifying sessions respectively meant Hamilton exited Q1 twice. But after a pit lane start, the Ferrari driver transformed his weekend's fortunes with an impressive climb through the field, becoming the first driver to jump to slicks. His reward was P7 after being unable to find a way round Albon's Williams.

For the fourth Grand Prix in succession, Bearman finished 11th and just outside the points in Belgium. But there was some joy for the Haas driver, as seventh in the Sprint meant he claimed his first points since Bahrain back in April as he utilised a low-drag set-up to reach Q3.

Russell, Ocon and Hadjar all nearly made it inside this week's top 10. Russell took a lonely fifth on Sunday, while both Ocon and Hadjar impressed during the Sprint. The Haas man finished fifth but pitted later than most on Sunday and finished down the order, while Hadjar bagged P8 in the Sprint but a second pit stop, and a car issue, left him last in the Grand Prix.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Piastri's Perfect Pass in Belgium

Radio Rewind: 2025 Belgian Grand Prix

George Russell believes Mercedes needs to ""revert back to what we had earlier in the season"" after failing to match the leading teams in the Belgian Grand Prix.

George Russell believes Mercedes needs to ""revert back to what we had earlier in the season"" after failing to match the leading teams in the Belgian Grand Prix, with fifth place ""probably flattering the real pace of the car"".

The Briton drove a lonely race on Sunday at Spa-Francorchamps, finishing 35s behind race winner Oscar Piastri having made up only one place from his starting position at the expense of Alex Albon in the early running when it was wet.

Since winning the Canadian Grand Prix back in June, Russell and Mercedes have lacked performance in the last three Grands Prix, which the 27-year-old has put down to a change in direction regarding the car focus.

""We need to understand why we've lost so much pace in recent races. Of course it's frustrating for all of us as a team, P5 was probably flattering the real pace of the car so I'm at least happy we got the maximum possible,"" said Russell.

""We made a clear change of direction a couple of months ago and I think since that point we've taken a step backwards.

""Sometimes it takes a few races to understand what the real reasons are for that lack of pace but clearly it seems like we need to revert back to what we had earlier in the season.""

Team mate Kimi Antonelli endured a difficult weekend, failing to make it beyond the first stage of Qualifying for both the Sprint and Grand Prix.

Having started from the pit lane after set-up changes, which included a new front wing for more downforce, the young Italian made two pit stops and eventually finished 16th.

""Today I had more confidence in the car, definitely with the new wing I had more stability and that was helping,"" said Antonelli.

""Also the car felt more connected so definitely took some confidence back and now is time to really try and work for Qualifying because when you start at the front is completely another story.

""Especially for Budapest where it's even harder to overtake to really do a good Qualifying and start at the front.""

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Piastri's Perfect Pass in Belgium

Radio Rewind: 2025 Belgian Grand Prix

The F1 Nation crew review all the stories from a busy Sprint weekend at the Belgian Grand Prix from Spa.

After a rain-soaked start to proceedings at Spa-Francorchamps, it was Oscar Piastri who ultimately came away with another victory when the Belgian Grand Prix got underway.

ESPN journalists Albert Fabrega and Juan Fossaroli join F1 Nation host Tom Clarkson in the Spa paddock to dissect what proved to be another huge weekend in the title fight between McLaren team mates Piastri and Lando Norris.

Piastri went into the weekend eight points clear of Norris at the top of the Drivers' Standings, but after beating him in both the Sprint and Grand Prix, that advantage has now doubled to 16 points.

How did the Australian ‘lure' him into that crucial overtake on the first lap of racing? Did ‘little errors' prove too costly for Norris? Or should McLaren have double stacked their pit stop to give him a better chance of fighting for the win?

Charles Leclerc secured his fifth podium of the season with P3. How much was Ferrari's performance down to their eagerly anticipated new rear suspension? And what do the guys make of a rollercoaster weekend for Lewis Hamilton?

And with Max Verstappen winning the Sprint and finishing P4 in the race, what will new Red Bull Team Principal Laurent Mekies take away from his first Grand Prix in charge of the squad? Will Verstappen be encouraged by his own performance as the team's new era gets underway?

""This is not the place for that conversation, I'm a real person who came here to play music,"" Spektor told the crowd. 


							By

Music Editor


	Singer-songwriter Regina Spektor's concert in Portland, Maine, was interrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters over the weekend, as some attendees in the audience shouted “free Palestine” chants during the middle of her show on Saturday.


	“You're just yelling at a Jew,” Spektor, who is Jewish and emigrated to New York from the Soviet Union as a child, is seen saying on a fan-captured video to a protester in the crowd at Revolution Hall after he started shouting “free fucking Palestine.” Other pro-Israel attendees in the audience were also shouting “Am Israel Chai,” which is Hebrew for “the people of Israel live.”

	“I don't know what he thinks he's doing,” Spektor said. “I really appreciate the security.”

	











	Spektor had voiced her support of Israel in the past, including just days after the Oct. 7, 2023, Nova Music Festival attack, where she wrote that “if you've devalued Jewish life so much that mourning murdered Jewish children at a festival raped women, and the largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust has offended you — leave.”


	Another fan started shouting “free, free Palestine” after the “free fucking Palestine” chant as well. “I thought this was different than the internet, this is real life,” Spektor said.


	A third attendee interrupted as well before the show could continue, saying that “there is a genocide happening. I'm watching children dying, that hurts.”


	“You can leave the show if you want, this is not an internet comment section, I know you're mistaking my show for a YouTube video,” Spektor continued. “I think you should go, this is not the place for that conversation. I'm a real person who came here to play music. If anybody wants to walk out, this is your chance. Does anybody else want to take a walk? You can.” In the fan video, a few more fans can be seen walking out.


	“The only reason I even speak English is because I came here to escape this shit. I only speak English because I came from a country where people treated jews as othered, and I'm being othered here and it sucks. It'd be nice if one of my family's generation didn't have to go to a new country and learn a new language and just stay put. Have nice lives, you guys,” Spektor said.

	











	The incident at Spektor's concert reflects the continued tension within the music community on how to address the ongoing Israel-Gaza conflict. Groups like Kneecap and Bob Vylan have courted significant controversy for their pro-Palestine, anti-Israel messaging on the music festival circuit over the past several months. In Kneecap's case, the Irish hip-hop group shared a message on the screen behind them during their Coachella weekend two set that read “fuck Israel, free Palestine.” English punk-rap duo Bob Vylan, meanwhile, lost their U.S. visas and were dropped by UTA after inciting a “death to the IDF” chant at Glastonbury back in June.


	Those actions caught criticism from Jewish advocacy groups, who called the messaging antisemitic. Both Kneecap and Bob Vylan denied those claims, stating that their words were aimed at the Israeli government, not Jewish people.


	“We are not for the death of Jews, Arabs, or any other race or group of people,” the duo wrote in a post on Instagram addressing the controversy. “We are for the dismantling of a violent military machine.”

The future of late night remains uncertain, especially following the abrupt cancellation of CBS's 'The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.'


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


	Seth Meyers is getting candid about late night television's uncertain future and the fear that comes along with it as the host of NBC's Late Night.


	The comedian, who has been hosting Late Night With Seth Meyers since 2014, recently appeared on the Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard podcast, where he opened up about the industry and how he'll feel if his show comes to an end. 




	Earlier this month, The Late Show With Stephen Colbert was abruptly canceled by CBS, with the network citing a “financial decision” for the cancellation. Armchair Expert noted on Instagram that this episode was filmed before The Late Show news.

					Anthony Mackie Jokes He's the ""White Dude Legend"" After Multiple Co-Stars Earned Emmy and Oscar Nominations		
			









	At one point, host Dax Shepard asked Meyers if he had any “fear” that his career in late night could “end tomorrow.”


	“I do. I mean, only because it is such a time we're living in, as far as the entertainment industry,” Meyers admitted. “There is this weird thing that I feel like I shifted from fearing that I wouldn't be good enough. And now my fear is weirdly more outside of my control, which is … just at some point, the ecosystem might not support [late night].”


	“I guess that's better than thinking it's your fault, but it is weird to not feel any control over it,” he added.


	Throughout his time in late night television, Meyers said he has learned to focus on what he can control, which is “just show up and do the work.”


	“That's the only part they're paying you to do. It's the only part you're good at,” he explained. “All the other problems, we have people that are as good at that as you are at the thing you do — and don't mess around with it.”

	











	He continued, “I sometimes take stock of, oh, this isn't the best time to be doing what I'm doing, but at least I got in. So I sometimes think, all right, the body of my work matters enough that the world knows Seth Myers in a way that I'm happy with.”


	Despite the uncertainty of late night and “whatever time we're living in now,” Meyers also noted that he has “had lower points in the body of the show.”


	“Early on in the show, we had some NBC executives actually say to us, ‘We're very worried about how the show's gonna go,'” he recalled. “But in a great way, with like no real instruction as to how to get out of it. We just wanted to plant fear.”


	Looking ahead, Armchair Expert co-host Monica Padman asked the comedian if his financial security helps ease his worries about Late Night coming to an end.


	“I would worry about myself, like, mental health-wise,” Meyers responded. “But I put a lot of thought into diversifying my skill set. Certainly, financially, I could have been fine just doing the show for the last eleven years. But then it was like, oh, you know what? I feel like there's something to trying to build a stand-up career and trying to do other things.”


	“It's more like, try to find something that makes you as happy as late night's making you, but it's not just to have busy work or anything. It's like, oh, I like these things, too. And there's no one entity that can take everything away at once, and I think that's the scariest situation to be in,” he added.

	











	After it was announced that The Late Show With Stephen Colbert would be ending in May 2026, Meyers took to his Instagram Story to pay tribute to his late night friend. “For as great a comedian and host he is, [Stephen Colbert] is an even better person,” he wrote at the time. “I'm going to miss having him on TV every night but I'm excited he can no longer use the excuse that he's ‘too busy to hang out' with me.”

For the book, August and Mazin drew on hours of Scriptnotes conversations, as well as their own storied careers, to help readers begin, refine and sell their own scripts.


							By 

	Lexy Perez


Associate Editor


Craig Mazin and John August may lend their storytelling expertise while hosting their podcast Scriptnotes, but now the hosts are ready to offer that knowledge in book form. 


	The Hollywood screenwriters will release SCRIPTNOTES: A Book About Screenwriting and Things That Are Interesting to Screenwriters, based on their hit podcast by the same name, offering an “ultimate guide for writing screenplays or building a screenwriting career,” The Hollywood Reporter can exclusively announce.




	On their podcast, Mazin and August discuss “everything from writer's block, to getting started in the industry, to the vagaries of work-for-hire and copyright law,” all the while sharing “their expertise and best tips for working in film and television.” For their podcast they have spoken to a myriad of entertainment figures, including Christopher Nolan, Greta Gerwig, Michael Schur, Rian Johnson, Aline Brosh McKenna, Ashley Nicole Black, Seth Rogen and more about the process of making a great script.

	Now, in their first book, August and Mazin “draw on more than one thousand hours of Scriptnotes podcast conversations, as well as their own storied careers, to help readers begin, refine, and sell their own scripts.” The book will be “part writing class, part informational interview with the best creators in the business.”

	











	The book will highlight the basic rules of screenwriting, the craft of creating a “compelling story with captivating protagonists, worthy antagonists and a sound structure” and give an overview of the business of pitching a script and the “do's and don'ts of working collaboratively on a project.”


	“After 700 episodes, we're excited to extend from the digital world into atoms. Sure: we've made T-shirts. And drinkware. And thumb drives. But you can't put those on your shelf to show off on a Zoom call. The orange Scriptnotes spine stands out, like that black CENTURY book everyone has but never read. Plus, our book turned out great and people will get a lot out of it. So they should actually read it, not like that CENTURY book,” Mazin and August said in a statement to THR.


	“Essential for veteran and novice screenwriters, film buffs, and anyone who enjoys analysis of iconic movies, Scriptnotes is a one-of-a-kind resource that provides exclusive access to the screenwriting process—and will inspire anyone ready to pen their own successful screenplay,” Crown said of the book. 


Scriptnotes will be published by Crown in a deal negotiated by Jodi Reamer at Writers House Literary Agency for North American rights.  


	Among the screenplays August has written are scripts for Charlie's Angels, Big Fish, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Frankenweenie and Aladdin. Meanwhile, Mazin's credits include being the creator and showrunner for acclaimed and Emmy-winning series Chernobyl and The Last of Us. His feature credits also include The Hangover Part II and III and Identity Thief.

	











	Both are former members of the WGA Board of Directors.


SCRIPTNOTES: A Book About Screenwriting and Things That Are Interesting to Screenwriters will release on December 2.

The late addition brings the main competition section of the Swiss festival to 18 titles.


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	The new film from Japanese director Naomi Kawase (Embracing, The Mourning Forest) that stars Vicky Krieps (Corsage, The Dead Don't Hurt, Hot Milk) has been added to the competition lineup of the 78th edition of the Locarno Film Festival.


Yakushima's Illusion (L'Illusion de Yakushima) is a French, Japanese, Luxembourgish, and Belgian co-production. 




	Past plot descriptions of the movie have said that it tells the story of Corry, a French heart transplants department coordinator who gets sent to a hospital in Japan to help improve its transplants department given that organ transplants are still largely taboo. She lives with a photographer, Jin, who is originally from the island of Yakushima in the south of Japan.

	“When I make a movie, I follow an invisible thread – one woven into the larger tapestry of dreams,” said Krieps. “This particular thread led me deep into the ancient forests of Yakushima and back into the gentle heart of childhood.” Concluded the star: “I walked the delicate line between ghosts and reality, drawn by the mystery of love.”


	The film, which according to IMDb also stars Kan'ichirô Satô, will have its world premiere in Locarno on Friday, Aug. 15, festival organizers said on Tuesday. Krieps is also listed as an executive producer on IMDb.  “Thus bringing the total films in the Concorso Internazionale to 18, Kawase's latest work will join the new films by Abbas Fahdel, Abdellatif Kechiche, Alexandre Koberidze, Ben Rivers, Dane Komljen, Elsa Kremser and Levin Peter, Fabrice Aragno, Hana Jušić, Ivana Mladenović, Janicke Askevold, Julian Radlmaier, Kamal Aljafari, Maureen Fazendeiro, Radu Jude, Rosanne Pel, Sho Miyake, Valentina and Nicole Bertani,” the Locarno festival said. All selected films will compete for the festival's top honor, the Pardo d'Oro, or Golden Leopard, which will this year be awarded by the competition jury led by Cambodian auteur Rithy Panh.   The 78th edition of the Swiss film fest takes place Aug. 6-16.

Months after the hip-hop stylist sued the R&B legend, lawyers for Blige didn't exactly hold back in their first response.


													By
												

	Bill Donahue



Mary J. Blige is firing back at a lawsuit filed by her former stylist Misa Hylton, accusing the longtime friend and her lawyers of “fabricating accusations” to try to win a settlement payout.


	The stylist sued Blige earlier this year, claiming the R&B legend had “sabotaged” Hylton's management relationship with the rapper Vado. At the time, Hylton's lawyer said the dispute was “very unfortunate” because the two were “probably closer than blood family.”


	In her first response to the lawsuit on Monday, lawyers for Blige didn't hold back – arguing that Hylton's allegations were not only “baseless” but also entirely fictional.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“Plaintiffs and their counsel appear to enjoy fabricating accusations that will be discussed in the press and on social media for the purposes of harassing defendants and trying to coerce a favorable settlement,” writes Blige, represented by veteran music litigator Lisa F. Moore.


	Blige is not only asking the judge to dismiss the “frivolous” case, but also seeking sanctions – monetary legal penalties — against Hylton and her lawyer, Nicholas Ramcharitar, for even filing it in the first place.


	“Plaintiffs and their counsel had significant time to investigate these issues, not only before filing but also after defendants' counsel sent a lengthy letter identifying with granular specificity why each of their claims is baseless,” Blige's lawyers write. “Yet, plaintiffs and their counsel chose not to withdraw the Complaint and instead appear to be doubling down.”


	Hylton is a longtime hip-hop stylist known for dressing Blige, Lil Kim, Missy Elliott, Aaliyah and many other stars in the 1990s and 2000s – including Kim's legendary breast-exposed purple jumpsuit at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards. When Hylton was honored in 2019 as someone who “helped shape the landscape of urban fashion,” Blige was in attendance.


	But in April, Hylton filed a lawsuit accusing her former client of a wide range of wrongdoing. The case claims that Blige exerted pressure on Vado (Teyon Winfree), who was signed to the star's Beautiful Life Records, to fire Hylton as his manager. The lawsuit, which Vado co-filed alongside Hylton, claims Blige is refusing to release an already-finished album or allow him to tour until he ditches Hylton.


	“Defendants are intentionally ‘drying out' plaintiff Winfree – exercising provisions in the [record contract] to intentionally withhold his music from the market and bar him from performing live and touring – in order to compel him to terminate his the talent contract with [Hylton and her company].”


	But in her first response on Monday, Blige's lawyers say the case is so flawed that Hylton and her lawyer must be punished for bringing it. They say the alleged contract between Hylton's firm and Vado is void because her company doesn't even legally exist; they also say that it was Vado himself who failed to meet the requirements of his record deal with Beautiful Life.


	The new response also reveals a scathing letter that Blige's attorneys sent to Hylton and Vado's lawyer shortly after the case was first filed in May. In it, they said the lawsuit was “riddled” with false statement, demanded that it be withdrawn, and threatened that they'd seek sanctions if it wasn't.


	“It is obvious that the complaint was filed by you and plaintiffs for the sole purpose of harassing and causing malicious injury to [Beautiful Life] and Ms. Blige based on Hylton's personal animus towards Ms. Blige,” they wrote in the letter, before later ending it ominously: “Your next step in handling this matter shall govern ours.”


	The letter also includes more details on the dispute, including a screencap in which Vado himself purportedly suggested that he might fire Hylton on his own initiative. “Between me and u I might be firing Misa,” the alleged text reads.


	The letter was attached to Monday's filing as support for Blige's demand for sanctions against Hylton and her lawyer. The star's attorneys say it shows that the plaintiffs were aware of the flaws in their case but chose to continue pursuing it, forcing Blige to “expend time and resources making this motion to dismiss their patently frivolous claims.”


	The filing did not specify an amount of sanctions that Blige is seeking. An attorney for Hylton did not immediately return a request for comment.

""We were having such a difficult time just being real with each other,"" Joe reflects of their past split on Mythical Kitchen's Last Meals series.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



	Band breakups are never easy — even when the members aren't related.


	So although it's been more than a decade since the Jonas Brothers temporarily parted ways in 2013, Joe, Nick and Kevin still have some complicated feelings regarding their split.


	In a clip from an upcoming episode of Mythical Kitchen's Last Meals series that Billboard is exclusively debuting below, the trio addresses whether they still harbor any “guilt” over the way they left things when the band broke up 12 years ago. Nick Jonas — whose idea it initially was for the brothers to fly solo after making music together for years — begins by saying that he doesn't feel “guilt so much as, in reflection, I can definitely see how I could have more lovingly communicated something that needed to be said.”


	“It's often how we say things that matters more than what we're saying,” Nick continues as his older brothers nod in agreement. “I think we all knew … it had run its course. I just didn't know how to maturely articulate that and lovingly do that.”

	











	Though the breakup was a hard call, Joe says that “it needed to happen.” 




			Trending on Billboard		







	“We were having such a difficult time just being real with each other back then,” the DNCE frontman adds in the interview. “Now it's like we can communicate way better, because we don't need to be scared to have tough conversations.”


	Following the Disney Channel-backed success of their first four albums, the JoBros decided to pull the plug on group activities after being unable to resolve internal disagreements over the direction of the band in 2013. Joe's remarks on Last Meals echo what he previously told Billboard of the split in 2019.


	“We all wanted to create something on our own and were just trying to force it into what was going on,” he said at the time. “We were going through the motions, without the heart of it … The way we communicated to each other wasn't healthy anymore.”


	Fast-forward to 2025, and the brothers are now gearing up to release their third album post-reunion. After coming back together in 2019 on Happiness Begins — which earned the band its first-ever No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 with “Sucker” — the Jonas Brothers are set to follow up 2023's The Album with Greetings From Your Hometown on Aug. 8.


	And in repairing their relationship as a band, Kevin says that their connections as family members are also stronger than ever now. “When there's a true need, we always band together,” he shares on the podcast. “We're brothers first.”


	The full episode of Last Meals featuring the Jonas Brothers will drop Thursday (July 31). Watch the exclusive clip below.

The star's attorneys renew calls for bail, claiming he might be ""the only person currently in a United States jail"" for merely being a prostitution customer.


													By
												

	Bill Donahue



Sean “Diddy” Combs is asking a federal judge to release him from jail ahead of his October sentencing date, arguing that prostitution customers, or “johns,” are essentially never incarcerated like he's been.


	Combs was acquitted earlier this month on the most serious criminal charges he faced over drug-fueled sex marathons called “freak-offs,” but was convicted on two lesser counts of interstate prostitution. When he's sentenced in October, he'll likely receive between two and five years in prison.

Rachel Scharf 













Judge Arun Subramanian ruled at the time that Combs must stay in jail until sentencing, citing his history of domestic violence. But in a new filing on Tuesday, his lawyers strongly urge the judge to reconsider – arguing that no other prostitution “john” would get such treatment.


	“Sean Combs should not be in jail for this conduct,” writes Marc Agnfilo and Diddy's other lawyers. “In fact, he may be the only person currently in a United States jail for being any sort of john.”


	Diddy's lawyers argue that harsh penalties, including pre-sentencing jail, is reserved for the people who run prostitution operations – and not for one person who merely hired prostitutes. They say the case against Diddy and his ongoing incarceration are genuinely unique in more than a century since the federal prostitution law was enacted.


	“There has literally never been a case like this one, where a person and his girlfriend arranged for adult men to have consensual sexual relations with the adult long-term girlfriend,” Diddy's lawyers write. “Mr. Combs is incarcerated while everyone else involved in this identical conduct – his girlfriends, the [prostitutes], the agency's leaders, the porn stars and others – walk free, as they should.”


	If released, Combs' lawyers say he will submit to previously-offered restrictions, including a $50 million bond and travel restrictions. They say he's not a flight risk and “will not be violent to anyone.”


	“As we said in court, this jury gave him his life back, and he will not squander his second chance at life, nor would he do anything to further jeopardize his seven children not having a father, and four of his children not having a parent at all,” Agnifilo writes.


	Combs' much-awaited sentencing hearing is scheduled for Oct. 3 in New York.

""Drake remains committed to returning and performing these shows when his schedule permits,"" read a statement from promoters.

	Tyler Jenke



	Five months after Drake cut short his tour of Australia and New Zealand, the remaining dates have officially been cancelled.


	Originally announced in November 2024, Drake's Anita Max Win Tour marked the rapper's first visit to Oceania since 2017. Launched in Australia in February 2025 with multiple dates in Perth, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, the 16-date sold-out tour was planned to wrap in early March following additional shows across Brisbane and Sydney, and two performances in Auckland, New Zealand.


	However, on Feb. 26, it was announced that the remaining dates had been postponed due to a “scheduling conflict.”

	A statement from Drake's representatives noted at the time that the musician's team were “actively working on rescheduling these dates along with adding some additional shows,” though no further updates arrived.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Now after months without any information as to the status of these unrealized shows, ticketholders received word on Tuesday, July 29 (Australia time) that the remainder of the tour had officially been cancelled.


	“Despite extensive efforts to find a solution, rescheduling within the necessary timeframe was not possible,” a statement from Live Nation Australia read. “Drake remains committed to returning and performing these shows when his schedule permits.”


	Drake returned to the stage earlier this month as part of his $ome $pecial $hows 4 U.K. tour alongside PartyNextDoor in support of their collaborative $ome $exy $ongs 4 U album. 

	











	The trek began with a series of dates in England, which will be followed by additional shows throughout Europe until the end of September. A planned performance in Manchester on Monday, July 28 was postponed this week, with an “unseen ferry schedule” necessitating the gig's move to Aug. 5.


	Drake's earlier run of Australian dates also made headlines thanks to the 6 God's generosity towards fans during his concerts. He previously handed out $20,000 to a pair of fans in Perth, gave $45,000 to some OVO faithful in Melbourne and upgraded a pregnant fan to VIP in Sydney and blessed her with $30,000 ahead of her baby's arrival. 


	As part of the tour's final shows, he also promised to look after the cancer treatment of a fan's mother while in Brisbane.


	The Anita Max Win Tour was named after a viral moment from Drake's December 2023 livestream on Kick, where he introduced a new “alter ego” named Anita Max Win. The name is a playful pun on the gambling phrase “I need a max win,” referring to hitting the maximum payout on a slot machine.

During her recent U.K. shows, Eilish also teased a new creative venture with Avatar and Titanic director James Cameron. 












	At her July 12 concert in Manchester, the singer acknowledged an increased number of cameras in the venue and hinted at a 3D project with Cameron, saying, “I can't say much about it, but it's something really special.”


	Eilish released Hit Me Hard and Soft in May 2025 via Darkroom/Interscope Records. The album debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart, earning 339,000 equivalent album units in its first week, and featured the singles “Lunch,” “Birds of a Feather,” and “Chihiro.” It follows her 2021 sophomore album Happier Than Ever, which topped the Billboard 200 and earned multiple Grammy nominations.


	Eilish will kick off the North American leg of her Hit Me Hard and Soft tour in September, with dates scheduled through December.

International Investigations Editor


Alon Aboutboul, the prolific Israeli actor who appeared in Hollywood movies such as The Dark Knight Rises and London Has Fallen, has died at the age of 60.


The Jerusalem Post and other Israeli media are reporting that Aboutboul died unexpectedly on HaBonim Beach in Tel Aviv on Tuesday morning. He reportedly collapsed and received unsuccessful CPR.


	Miki Zohar, Israel's minister for culture and sport, paid tribute to Aboutboul, saying that the actor had left a “profound” mark on the nation's culture.


	Born on May 28, 1965, in Kiryat Ata, Aboutboul appeared in more than 100 film and television titles, including a breakout role in Two Fingers from Sidon, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in 1986.

	











	Two years later, he was credited for a part in Rambo III, while other Hollywood roles would follow. Ridley Scott cast him in 2008's Body of Lies opposite Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe.


	In 2012, Aboutboul played Russian nuclear physicist Dr. Pavel in Christopher Nolan's Batman finale, The Dark Knight Rises. Another notable role came in 2016's London Has Fallen, in which he starred as Aamir Barkawi, an arms dealer-turned-terrorist mastermind.


DEADLINE RELATED VIDEO:


	Aboutboul also embraced TV work. In the FX series Snowfall, he appeared as recurring character Avi Drexler in 25 episodes. He also featured in 2017's Twin Peaks.


	“I was deeply saddened to hear about the sudden passing of the actor Alon Aboutboul, may his memory be blessed,” Zohar said, per a translation on X/Twitter.


	“Over the years, he portrayed a wide range of characters, bringing depth and emotion to them, leaving a profound mark on Israeli culture.”

Palestinian activist and community leader Odeh Hathalin (aka Awdah Hathaleen), who worked with directors Basel Adra and Yuval Abraham on their Oscar-winning documentary No Other Land, has been shot dead by an Israeli settler in the Occupied West Bank.


	In a post on X, Israeli journalist and documentarian Abraham reported that Hathalin was shot in the chest on Monday by an Israeli settler. 


	The director said the assailant had been identified by local residents as Yinon Levi, who is among a group of Israeli settlers operating in the West Bank, who have been sanctioned by the UK and the EU, while Donald Trump rescinded restrictions at the beginning of his presidency this year.

An Israeli settler just shot Odeh Hadalin in the lungs, a remarkable activist who helped us film No Other Land in Masafer Yatta. Residents identified Yinon Levi, sanctioned by the EU and US, as the shooter. This is him in the video firing like crazy. pic.twitter.com/xH1Uo6L1wN


	The post also featured footage of Levi brandishing a gun and firing wildly, although it was not clear whether the images were related to the incident in which Hathalin was killed.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Israeli media reported that Levi was arrested by Israeli police on Monday on suspicion of fatally shooting  Hathalin, but was released on house arrest on Tuesday, while investigations continued.


No Other Land, which won the Best Documentary Academy award this year, documents the cycle of destruction and harassment on a collection of hamlets and their Bedouin communities which lie on the Palestinian West Bank side of the 1949 Green Line.


	Their future has been at stake since Israel declared much of the land they are situated on a live-fire training zone in the 1980s, with their inhabitants coming under further pressure from the construction of illegal Israeli settlements on their doorstep such as Carmel and Ma'on.

	











	Hathalin has been described as a father of three, English teacher and activist hailing from the village of Umm Al-Kheir, who supported journalists visiting the area and also took part in in the filming of No Other Land.


	“I can hardly believe it. My dear friend Awdah was slaughtered this evening.He was standing in front of the community center in his village when a settler fired a bullet that pierced his chest and took his life. This is how Israel erases us — one life at a time,” wrote No Other Land co-director Adra on his X account, attaching an image of them together in Rome. 


	Hathalin's murder comes amid growing violence settler across the entire West Bank in recent months and sparked been widespread condemnation.


	France's Ministry For Europe and Foreign Affairs put out a statement on Tuesday voicing the country's “immense sadness” on learning of “the murder” of Odeh Hathalin.


	“France condemns this murder in the strongest possible terms, as well as all the deliberate violence perpetrated by extremist settlers against the Palestinian population, which has been increasing across the West Bank, particularly in Kafr Malik and the Christian village of Taybeh in recent weeks,” read the statement. 


	“This violence constitutes an act of terrorism. Settlers have killed more than 30 people since the beginning of 2022. Israeli authorities must take responsibility and immediately punish the perpetrators of this violence, which continues with impunity, and protect Palestinian civilians,” it added.

Christopher Nolan has been criticized for shooting elements of Universal's all-star epic The Odyssey in Morocco-occupied Western Sahara.


	The British director has been filming near the coastal city of Dakhla, which is part of a region that the United Nations has designated as a “non‑self‑governing territory” since 1963.


	The territory, which has become a magnet for big-budget shoots like the Prime Video series The Wheel of Time, is not legally part of Morocco, but the U.S. and UK are among Western governments to recently endorse the North African nation's claim over the land.

	











	The Western Sahara International Film Festival (FiSahara), which takes place in the Sahrawi refugee camps in Algeria, called on Nolan to urgently halt shooting in the region. Universal has been contacted for comment.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“Dakhla is not just a beautiful location with cinematic sand dunes. Primarily, it is an occupied, militarised city whose indigenous Sahrawi population is subject to brutal repression by occupying Moroccan forces,” the festival said.


	“By filming part of The Odyssey in an occupied territory billed as a ‘news black hole' by Reporters Without Borders, Nolan and his team, perhaps unknowingly and unwillingly, are contributing to the repression of the Sahrawi people by Morocco.”


In a statement, FiSahara continued: “We are sure that were they to understand the full implications of filming such a high-profile film in a territory whose indigenous peoples are unable to make their own films about their stories under occupation, Nolan and his team would be horrified.”

	











	“Morocco routinely touts Sahrawi cultural expressions as uniquely Moroccan. They created a film festival in Dakhla to counter ours, and produce high-budget films that portray Western Sahara as part of Morocco. However, Sahrawis trying to make films about their lives are persecuted and must work clandestinely and at great risk to themselves and their families.”


	FiSahara has been supported by actors including Javier Bardem and Penélope Cruz in the past. Bardem posted the FiSahara statement regarding The Odyssey, arguing that Dakhla was “converted by the Moroccan occupiers into a tourist destination and now a film set, always with the aim of erasing the Sahrawi identity of the city.”

A post shared by Javier Bardem (@bardemantarctic)


The Odyssey is led by Matt Damon, Tom Holland, Zendaya, Anne Hathaway, Lupita Nyong'o, Robert Pattinson, Benny Safdie, Charlize Theron, Jon Bernthal, Himesh Patel, Elliott Page, Bill Irwin, Samantha Morton, Jesse Garcia, Will Yun Lee and Corey Hawkins.


	The film, currently set for a release in Imax on July 17, 2026, has been shooting at locations in Morocco, Italy, Ireland, and Scotland. Based on Homer's epic poem, the story follows Odysseus (played by Damon), King of Ithaca, on his dangerous journey home after the Trojan War. 


	During his voyage, the protagonist faces Polyphemus the Cyclops, Sirens, the nymph Calypso and the witch goddess Circe in the treacherous oceans that separate him from his island home and wife Penelope, who unravels a wedding train that she weaves every night in the event that one of the suitors who have taken over her home ends up marrying her should her husband not return. Odysseus' memory is also guarded by his son Telemachus (Holland). The story also features gods including Athena, Poseidon and Zeus.

Wait, Matt Damon is the lead?  That's what they should be complaining about.

Dakhla is “an occupied, militarised city whose indigenous Sahrawi population is subject to brutal repression by occupying Moroccan forces.” But it's also home to a local film festival. Yeah, sounds super brutal.

There's a bunch of Ukrainian film festivals too, but I'm not flying there any time soon.

Don't stop shooting, Chris.

More online nonsense outrage to fuel a slow news day

More like a slow news decade!
I would just like to read about movies.
Leave all this click baity crap out of it!

Someone is triggered! If Christopher Nolan were involved in joining Moroccans in tormenting these people then I would care, but he's not.

A24 this morning debuted the first trailer for Eternity, a romantic comedy starring Elizabeth Olsen (His Three Daughters), Miles Teller (The Gorge), and Callum Turner (Masters of the Air), which is slated to hit theaters this November after world premiering at the Toronto Film Festival.


	Directed by David Freyne, the film is set in an afterlife where souls have one week to decide where to spend eternity. Our protagonist, Joan (Olsen), is faced with the impossible choice between the man she spent her life with (Teller) and her first love (Turner), who died young and has waited decades for her to arrive.

	











	Oscar nominees Trevor White and Tim White produced under their Star Thrower Entertainment banner. In addition to directing, Freyne co-wrote alongside Pat Cunnane, whose original script appeared on the  2022 Black List. We were first to report on the project, which also stars John Early, Olga Merediz, and Da'Vine Joy Randolph, in March 2024.

	Coming off the release of Ari Aster's dark Covid era Western comedy Eddington, starring Joaquin Phoenix, A24 is next set to release Architecton — a Berlin-premiering documentary from filmmaker Viktor Kossakovsky — on August 1.  Other upcoming titles for the studio include Spike Lee's Highest 2 Lowest starring Denzel Washington and Ne Zha 2 on August 22, Benny Safdie's The Smashing Machine starring Dwayne Johnson on October 3, and the Timothée Chalamet starrer Marty Supreme on December 25.

I really don't get ‘afterlife' stories. These characters aren't living anymore, so where are the stakes? Who cares?

We're only gonna give Miles Teller a few more chances, then we'll learn our lesson that he's not a leading man, but I swear, only eight or nine more and THAT'S IT.

Wow, interesting premise that lost my interest before the trailer ended! Why does Miles Teller look so old?

It's 'cause he's got some MILES on him at this point.
LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLO-

I watched a short with this premise a couple of years ago.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","King Of The Hill comes back a little meaner (but at least that boy's alright)","https://www.avclub.com/king-of-the-hill-season-14-review-hulu-tv","Tue, 29 Jul 2025 15:00:00 GMT","

When we see Hank Hill for the first time in 15 years, he's being humiliated: trying (and mostly failing) to pee in a tiny airplane bathroom while being forced to listen to his wife regale a growing crowd of irritated onlookers with his most intimate medical details. It's a strange start to what will prove to be a largely gentle return to King Of The Hill's world of propane, propane accessories, and, yes, the inescapable specter of the “narrow urethra.” It suggests that there might be something just a tad crueler operating in the show's new-old heart, a suspicion that lurks throughout a first episode that dances around the idea that Hank Hill's small-c conservatism may have calcified into something a little uglier, and more reactive, in his advancing years.  

It's a weird pilot all around, really—most notably when it deliberately cuts the show off from its most vital relationship: the one between Hank and Peggy Hill (still series co-creator Mike Judge and the wonderful Kathy Najimy) and their now-adult son, Bobby (Pamela Adlon). There's a reason for this—Bobby has changed the most out of all our characters in the eight (in-universe) years since we last saw him, and the show wants to give him room to stand on his own two feet. But the disconnect still makes for a weak first impression, as the Hills acclimate (poorly) to life back on Rainey Street after several years spent working in the propane business in Saudi Arabia.

Luckily, once King Of The Hill—now showrun by Saladin K. Patterson, a veteran TV writer who last wrestled with The Reboot Machine in service of The Wonder Years—settles into its groove, these initial tensions largely vanish. Sure, Hank will occasionally get a little “uncle you don't talk to at dinner much anymore,” cracking an “assigned at birth” joke here or waxing ecstatic about the legacy of George W. Bush there. (The infamous limp handshake has, apparently, been forgiven.) But the show's belief in its hero's inherent decency manages to transform those moments from red flags into mere eye rolls. King Of The Hill was never a political show, in any meaningful sense of the phrase, and it hasn't fallen into that pitfall here: This is still first and foremost a comedy about culture and character.

And oh, what a character it's found in Bobby Hill, who has managed—despite eight billion childhood recitations of “that boy ain't right”—to grow up into a genuinely great TV protagonist, powered by Adlon's good-as-ever voice work. Now 21, and working in his own fusion Japanese-German restaurant in Dallas, Bobby has been largely exorcised of an original slate of character flaws that were, to be fair, mostly rooted in being an impressionable kid. Smarter and more driven, but still possessed of his old kindness and charisma, this Bobby naturally gravitates into the “sane man surrounded by weirdos” position that was once the sole province of his old man. He's also a lot harder to push around, with many of the revival's best episodes—including one where Hank learns, to his enduring horror, that his son's restaurant runs on charcoal—focusing on the pair working through conflicts that once would have seen Bobby get steamrolled by Hank. Call it fan service if you like. But there's real pleasure, which the series itself revels in, in seeing this soft, sweet kid grow into a genuinely good man. (Also, in case you were wondering: Bobby Hill absolutely pulls.) 

The younger Hill is also at the center of the revival show's very lightly serialized elements, which focus on both his restaurant (bankrolled by classic KOTH amoral money guy Ted Wassanasong) and his efforts to rekindle a friendship with childhood sweetheart Connie Souphanousinphone (a returning Lauren Tom). The emphasis here is on lightly. The original King Of The Hill often went for Simpsons levels of resetting the table between episodes; the revival, by contrast, allows small narrative threads to wind across its ten-episode season. (The most notable non-Bobby one examines how both Hank and Peggy struggle to adapt to the free time of retirement.) It's a mild concession to the realities of modern TV but not an unwelcome one. Characters can't help but feel a little realer when they have memories that actually persist between episodes.

But, you're likely wondering, is the show funny? Undeniably and most especially when it leans on two factors that were both hallmarks of the original series. The first is a best-in-class voice cast, once again MVP'd by Stephen Root. Having gone full shut-in since the original series ended, Root's Bill Dauterive remains the definitive TV sad sack, with the veteran actor still capturing every nuance of the character's prickly, deeply attention-seeking brand of existential loneliness. He's matched, as ever, by Najimy, who continues to make a virtue of many of Peggy Hill's most joyfully irritating character traits. (Her confident pronunciation of “Saudi Arabi-eye” rates at least a smile every time it crops up.) The situation surrounding the show's other top character, Dale Gribble, is, admittedly, a bit more complicated. Even before Johnny Hardwick died midway through the show's production, it's clear his voice had changed significantly in the intervening years: His Dale is gruffer, and more monotone, than it was in the original series and doesn't have the excitable high-pitched registers that powered so many memorable “sh-sha” and “S'go!”s. (Toby Huss, picking up the character three-quarters of the way into the season, opts to match Hardwick's modern voice instead of his earlier one.) But Dale, as a character, is still wholly recognizable—even as some of his conspiratorial, rabble-rousing madness has become slightly less charming on account of becoming quite a bit more mainstream since the series was last on the air. 



Which leads neatly into the other familiar factor powering King Of The Hill's comedy engine: Its willingness to tackle cultural criticism head-on. “The One Where Hank Hill Wrestles With A Societal Concept” was a classic King Of The Hill plotline back in the old days, and the show doesn't shy away from it here: The new series examines topics like cultural appropriation and the gig economy and—in a satisfying late-season entry—demonstrates exactly what a Certified Wife Guy like Hank Hill would think of the misogynistic other-blaming of the manosphere. The commentary itself ranges from surface-level to modestly insightful—if you're seeking anything deeper than “basic common sense and decency” from an animated sitcom, you're out of luck—but it's still nice to see the series bare its teeth from time to time.

Revival projects like King Of The Hill serve multiple masters as a matter of course. Nostalgia must be fed, whether it comes in the form of a sight gag referencing (the now-late) Chuck Mangione or the simple pleasure of hearing Judge slip back into good ol' boy Boomhauer's beautiful, semi-coherent mumbles. (The show struggles a bit more with how to handle less rosy aspects of its legacy. Hardwick and Jonathan Joss both get “In Memory” cards, and Tom Petty is at least acknowledged via a needle drop. But there's something sad, and maybe even a little disingenuous, about the series neglecting to give even a passing tribute to Brittany Murphy's Luanne.)

But in the grand scheme of things, shows like this live or die not on whether we loved their characters back in the day but if we love the people they've become now. By that metric, King Of The Hill is a rousing success. The show isn't perfect. But that boy? He's just right.  

King Of The Hill season 14 premieres August 4 on Hulu

Boy, this Epstein is all anybody is ever talking about. No matter what President Donald Trump does, whether he's instituting unpopular tariffs or ordering a secret police force to kidnap people off the streets or threatening to prosecute Beyoncé or posting Facebook slop of a woman picking up a snake, all anyone wants to do is ask about his ties to Jeffrey Epstein. At least it's making Jon Stewart's job easier.

﻿

A decade into the Trumpian takeover of American politics, we no longer hear as many people claiming that comedy will improve under Trump. Considering the proliferation of explicitly bigoted stand-up comedy and podcasts, we can safely say the opposite has been true. Even before Elon Musk made comedy legal again, it's been a pretty rough couple of years. But on tonight's Daily Show, Jon Stewart let the big guy do the talking, and talk he did. Trump couldn't escape the Epstein scandal while in Scotland promoting his big, beautiful, economy-destroying tariffs, and his attempts to deflect only gave Stewart more ammo. He tried to explain that he cut Epstein out for the “inappropriate” behavior of poaching Trump's staff and explained that he “never had the privilege of going to his island.” Unfortunately, that's not the best way to frame turning down a trip to pedophile island.

But Trump always has help. In another clip, this time of Trump playing golf over the weekend, Trump's caddy can be seen sneakily dropping a ball for the President. Stewart turned the help Trump received from his caddy into a larger point about how the President keeps finding ways to wiggle out of these messes.

“When the going gets tough, the tough pay someone to cheat for you. But this moment on the course, seemingly random, could not be more representative of Trump's entire existence. He moves with a confidence in this world because he requires that everyone in his orbit do whatever they can, including cheating, to ensure things go Trump's way. It's been his whole life. Don't want to go to Vietnam? Get a podiatrist, a friend of the family to bone spur you up. Your casino is failing? Perhaps Daddy can illegally float you three million in chips to try and save it. Impeached for an attempted coup? Your caddy today is the Kentucky Fried Reaper.”

Who is the Kentucky Fried Reaper? The answer lies in tonight's clip. All that, plus Emmy nominee Jessica Williams!

Awdah Hathaleen, a Palestinian activist and journalist who contributed to the Oscar-winning 2024 documentary No Other Land, was killed Monday in an attack by Israeli settlers. Captured footage of the attack appears to show Israeli settler Yinon Levi, who had previously been put under sanctions by Joe Biden before they were removed by Donald Trump, firing his gun indiscriminately during the attack. He was later arrested by Israeli police for questioning, though no charges were filed against him, The Guardian reports. 

Residents of the village of Umm al-Khair in the West Bank, where the attack took place, reported that Hathaleen was killed after a settler drove a bulldozer onto their land, destroying trees and property. When an activist approached the driver to ask them to stop, the driver allegedly knocked him down with the bulldozer's blade. Other residents responded by throwing stones, during which Levi allegedly entered the fray and began shooting. The Guardian reports that Hathaleen was standing a distance away, but was struck by a bullet. 

“I can hardly believe it. My dear friend Awdah was slaughtered this evening,” Basel Adra, No Other Land‘s Palestinian co-director, shared on social media. “He was standing in front of the community center in his village when a settler fired a bullet that pierced his chest and took his life. This is how Israel erases us — one life at a time.” Adra also shared footage of the attack, reiterating that Levi is currently “sanctioned by 9 countries (now 8, because of Trump).” Yuval Abraham, the documentary's Israeli co-director, also shared the video, calling Hathaleen “a remarkable activist.”

Last month, Hathaleen and his cousin Eid al-Hathaleen attempted to fly to the U.S. for a series of planned talks but had their entry denied and their visas revoked at the San Francisco International Airport. “Just a few weeks ago, Awdah attempted to come to San Francisco to build bridges between cultures—to share a message of peace. He had come to raise summer camp funds to help give Palestinian children experiencing the unthinkable a semblance  of a childhood back home,” San Francisco supervisor Bilal Mahmood, who previously protested the visa revocation, wrote in a statement on X on Monday. “Now we've learned he has been murdered. This is an absolute tragedy, and must be condemned. Sadly, it is just one more example of the human toll brought on by the Israeli government's occupation of Palestine.”

Just last week, Hathaleen wrote of the destruction of his village in an article for independent Israeli-Palestinian publication +972. “The demolition forces enter the village. All the children run to their mothers, who scramble to salvage whatever they can from their homes before it's too late. Everyone watches on anxiously to see who will be made homeless today. The bulldozers gather in the center of the village and then stop. Soldiers disembark. The villagers look each other in the eye, searching for words of comfort, but there are none. Our children ask us why this is happening, but we have no answers,” he wrote. “Amid all of this injustice, we often feel forgotten, lost, or hopeless. Sometimes we wonder: why do Israelis see us as terrorists and enemies? Why is the world not acting to achieve justice for Palestinians? But most of the time, we feel tired. The attacks, the raids, the demolitions: we think about them all the time. I always say that I wish fate hadn't brought us to this point. But now we are stuck here; there's no way to leave.”

The return of disgraced governor Andrew Cuomo is only one reason why New York City's mayoral primary made national news this year. Since losing the mayoral primary last month to Zohran Mamdani, people across the country have been watching Cuomo attempt to rekindle his campaign by disregarding traffic laws and rebranding himself as a friend of the people to little success. Alas, Cuomo says he's staying in the race as an independent, which gave writer and comedian merritt k the inspiration for the Cuomo And The Quest For Gracie Mansion video game.

“You are Andrew Cuomo, disgraced former governor of New York State,” the game's description reads. “Can you beat Zohran Mamdani in the New York mayoral race? Probably not. But try anyway! Six endings to discover and lots of Real Cuomo Facts to learn.”

The game puts you in the head of a vengeful Cuomo as he spirals in the months leading to Election Day. Quest For Gracie is a choose-your-own-adventure visual novel that allows players to decide between connecting with New Yorkers or offering a sacrifice to the dark spirits seeking to regain control of the Big Apple. But that's a future the game's creator, merritt k, is hoping to avoid.

“I lived in New York City during the second half of Andrew Cuomo's term as governor of New York State. During that time, I saw firsthand how his policies and behavior hurt average New Yorkers,” creator merritt k said in a statement. “I wanted to satirize his desperate, flailing efforts to take down the incredibly popular, galvanizing politician that is Zohran Mamdani, but also highlight some of his many past terrible acts, any one of which should in my mind disqualify him from becoming mayor.”

A24's latest niche market is the love triangle. See: Past Lives, Challengers, and Materialists (yeah, those are all written by the same married couple, what of it?). But on Tuesday they debuted the love triangle to end all love triangles, literally. In the Eternity trailer, Joan (Elizabeth Olsen) wakes up in the afterlife and immediately faces the highest-stakes choice she'll ever make: spend eternity with her second husband of many decades Larry (Miles Teller), or her first husband who died young (Callum Turner)?

If that wasn't intense enough, Olsen only has one week to decide between the two loves of her life. It's unclear why Turner got to hang around “the Junction” for decades waiting for Joan to show up while Joan only gets days to choose, but it does allow Turner some swoon-worthy moments: “When eternity's on the line, seems like nothing,” he says of the long wait for his wife. “That's a good opener,” Joan has to admit. Larry may find it tough to compete with his wife's long-lost war hero husband, but as he insists, he can be romantic too. “I don't care where we end up, just as long as we're together,” he tells Joan, adding later, “Knowing you're happy makes me happy.”

﻿

The afterlife (or at least “the Junction”) in Eternity has a Good Place-esque cutesy cheer coupled with a capitalistic sense of competition—not just between eternal companions, but also among the possible locales to spend forever. There are sign spinners and spokespeople representing places like “Smoker's World,” “Studio 54 World,” or “Man Free World.” We also meet two afterlife coordinators, played by the delightful duo John Early and Oscar winner Da'Vine Joy Randolph. David Freyne (Dating Amber) directed the film from a script he co-wrote with Pat Cunnane (Designated Survivor). Eternity will have its world premiere at the Toronto Film Festival in September before debuting in theaters in November.

The world is still in mourning following the tragic death of “Cosby Show” star Malcolm-Jamal Warner. Naturally, his fans, friends, family, and industry colleagues have posted heartfelt tributes since the news of his death broke on July 21. Now, Keshia Knight Pulliam, who played his sister on the famed show, has weighed in. 

Malcolm-Jamal Warner passed away on July 20 while on vacation with his family in Costa Rica. Sadly, he drowned, and his official cause of death is listed as accidental asphyxia. His autopsy was completed on July 22. He leaves behind a wife, a daughter, and a slew of friends and family members. 

“Cosby Show” actress Keshia Knight Pulliam took to her Instagram account on July 27 to pay tribute to Malcolm-Jamal Warner. She said in the caption of the post, “A week ago I lost my big brother, but I gained an angel… I love you… I miss you… We got our girls.”

A post shared by Keshia Knight Pulliam (@keshiaknightpulliam)

The post itself contains a video of Malcolm-Jamal Warner on stage playing the bass guitar. Notably, Malcolm-Jamal wasn't only an actor. He was also a Grammy award-winning musician. It is believed that the video was from a performance at City Winery in Atlanta. 

The end of the clip shows two young girls walking with a horse. Many online believe the two girls are Keshia and Malcolm's respective daughters, but this has not been confirmed. 

Keshia Knight Pulliam also posted the clip to her Instagram story. Following this, she shared her reasoning for not commenting on Malcolm-Jamal Warner's passing sooner. She wrote, “Thank you for every text, call, and all of the love that you have sent my way…”

She went on, “I've just needed a moment.” Of course, this is understandable as it seems the two remained close in the decades after “The Cosby Show” came to an end. 

Malcolm-Jamal Warner and Keshia Knight Pulliam both starred on “The Cosby Show” throughout its run. This was from 1984 until 1992 on NBC. As her posts allude to, she played Rudy Huxtable, the youngest child in the family. 

As mentioned, the two remained close in recent years. According to USA Today, Keshia Knight Pulliam was even a guest on an episode of his “Not All Hood” podcast. This was about a month before his tragic passing.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Hulk Hogan's Family Starts to Sign Up for WWE Raw Appearances","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/hulk-hogan-family-wwe-raw-appearances/","Tue, 29 Jul 2025 01:19:50 GMT","

Tributes to Hulk Hogan are far from over. Hulk Hogan's family is continuing to honor his legacy in meaningful ways, beginning with appearances at WWE events and heartfelt public tributes. Following the wrestling icon's emotional sendoff on Friday Night SmackDown, his 35-year-old son Nick Hogan is now set to attend WWE “Raw” in Detroit, Michigan, on Monday night, according to TMZ Sports.

While it remains unclear whether Nick will participate in the show, his presence marks the first known family appearance since the WWE legend passed away last week.

On Friday's episode of SmackDown, WWE honored Hulk with a 10-bell salute, a video package celebrating his legendary career, and a heartfelt speech from Triple H. 

Fans and fellow wrestlers paid tribute to the Hall of Famer who helped define professional wrestling's golden era. 

The video montage showcased highlights from Hogan's decades-long legacy and was followed by a standing ovation.

TMZ was first to report that Hogan died on July 24 at age 71 after suffering cardiac arrest at his home in Clearwater, Florida. His death prompted a wave of emotional tributes from figures across the worlds of wrestling, politics, and entertainment. Tributes were paid by Vince McMahon, Ric Flair, President Donald Trump, Sylvester Stallone, Diplo, and Logan Paul.

A post shared by Nick Hogan (@nickhogan)

On Sunday, which also marked Nick Hogan's birthday, the late star's only son took to social media to share a heartfelt tribute.

“My dad was the most incredible person I've ever known and will always be my hero,” Nick wrote. “He was the most kind, loving, and amazing father anybody could ask for. I feel so blessed to have had the greatest dad in the world.”

Shortly after TMZ broke the news, Hogan's family released an official statement confirming the loss.

“It is with a heavy heart and deep sadness that we confirm we have lost a legend,” the statement read. “Our beloved Terry Bollea, known worldwide as Hulk Hogan, passed away today surrounded by his loved ones.”

“May we all take solace in the wonderful memories he left behind for the millions of fans worldwide whose lives he touched for more than four decades. He will be missed, but never forgotten.”

Nick, 34, and his elder sister Brooke, 37, are the children of Hulk Hogan and his ex-wife Linda, with whom he was married for 26 years. Though the pair parted ways years ago, Linda shared a sentimental throwback photo with Hulk just days before his passing, writing, “The good old days!”

Earlier this year, Brooke became a mother to twins, Oliver and Molly, with partner Steven.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Heidi Klum Gushes Over ‘Gorgeous' Husband, Reveals Matching Tattoos & Lingerie Dates","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/heidi-klum-husband-tom/","Tue, 29 Jul 2025 00:56:55 GMT","

Heidi Klum is living proof that love doesn't come with an expiration date or a playbook. At 52, the supermodel, business mogul, and mother of four is not only still turning heads, but she's also head-over-heels for her husband of five years, Tokio Hotel guitarist Tom Kaulitz.

“He's so gorgeous,” Klum gushed in her recent People cover story. “He loves me in a miniskirt. He loves me in pumps. He just loves it when I get all dolled up.” If that's not true love, we don't know what it is! But the model went on to reveal that he apparently loves sitting outside the fitting room while she tries on lingerie, too. Not exactly your average date night, but it works for them, so why not? Props to them! 

A post shared by People Magazine (@people)

The couple first met at a friend's party back in 2018. Fun fact, apparently Klum nearly skipped the event but gave herself what she called “a little kick in the butt” to go. That decision changed everything, to say the least. By February 2019, the two were married. “Meeting him was the sliding door moment of my life,” she said.

Tom, 35, didn't just sweep her off her feet; he gave her a clean slate. Coming off two previous marriages, first to celebrity hairstylist Ric Pipino and then to singer Seal, with whom she shares three children, Klum was initially guarded. “At first I wanted to project what I had learned from different men I had been with,” she admitted. But Kaulitz stopped her cold in her tracks. “He said, ‘Don't do this to me, because I'm not this person. I have to have a fair chance.” 

A bold move for a bold woman, if you ask us. 



Safe to say the rest was history for these two, and these days, their spark is far from fading. The couple even has matching tattoos to prove how strong their bond is. They each have each other's names inked on their fingers to remind them of their marriage. Klum went on to joke that hers came out better, cheekily saying, “So I'm the better tattoo artist.”

Behind closed doors, they keep things fresh with “stolen weekends,” “handwritten notes,” and, according to Klum, “a few things I can't share.” Wink, wink! 

But, she did make it admirably known that despite the criticism she might get due to their age gap, she doesn't care. Klum is 17 years older than her husband, and yes, she couldn't care less what people think. Because, well, it's none of their business, you know?

“When our door closes at home, I don't really care so much what happens around us,” she said. “I've learned things from my husband that I didn't know I was capable of doing.”

A post shared by Heidi Klum (@heidiklum)

Klum's not just thriving in her personal life, but she's also returning to “Project Runway” for Season 21. This season, she'll join longtime collaborators Nina Garcia and Christian Siriano, with newcomer Law Roach joining the judging table. “New house, new rules. See you next week,” she said on Instagram about their return on July 31st. 

Between modeling gigs, red carpets, and her kids' careers taking off (her daughter Leni, 21, and son Henry, 19, are both modeling now), Klum is everywhere. But she's doing it all with that signature smile and unapologetic confidence that we all adore and can't get enough of.

“I've been photographing nude or in lingerie since 1992, way before Instagram,” she told People. “Now, instead of being in my little bottoms in a magazine, I'm on Instagram. It's the same thing.”

Indeed, at 52 she's still posting bikini pics and flaunting what she calls her “loud” personality, and she is looking better than ever. “I don't have this age-shaming or body-shaming thing. I like to run around sexy—even now at 52.”

And when the gray hairs come? Bring it; heck, she's even waiting for it! “Don't we all want to get old?” Klum said. “I'm already looking at 60 and 70, hopefully 80 and 90. And if we're still kicking it then, let's celebrate.”

Klum is ready for it all at this point, and we love seeing her so careless and free!

Cirie Fields has dropped the biggest hint yet that her incredible “Survivor” journey may be coming to an end. The 55-year-old reality TV mastermind, who transformed from self-described “couch potato” to beloved strategist, recently suggested that the upcoming milestone season could mark her final competitive appearance on the iconic show.

During a candid interview with Entertainment Weekly, Fields addressed the possibility of stepping away from the game that made her a household name. When asked about her future plans after filming both “Australian Survivor: Australia v The World” and the highly anticipated “Survivor 50,” her response was telling.

“Oh, Dalton, I'm tired. I'll go and do a guest spot if they want me to come and teach some of these young'uns how to play,” Fields said. “Or maybe be a supportive coach or something. I don't know if Jeff needs a nurse on set, maybe. But outside of that, I'm like, ugh.”

The former nurse's comments suggest a shift from active competition to a mentorship role, though she hasn't completely closed the door on future appearances. 

“I never say never though. And somebody told me, never say never. So I never say never. But I feel like 50 was my swan song,” she revealed during the interview.

Fields has been refreshingly honest about how playing “Survivor” in her fifties differs from her earlier experiences. She offered a colorful analogy to describe the physical challenges of competing at her current age compared to her debut season.

“Playing Survivor in your fifties is like driving a car that you had 20 years ago,” she explained. “It was brand new when you drove it off the lot. It was shiny and you had all the gadgets and stuff, and you had that new car smell.”

The comparison continues with typical Cirie humor: “Then, after about 10 years or so, you might need to change a fuel pump or catalytic converter. 15 years, you might need a head gasket. 20 years? You think about trading that car in. That's what it is like.”

Fields acknowledged that age brings constant reminders during gameplay. “It lets you know, every second of your age when you play at 50 versus 35,” she shared, noting that while she felt 25 at age 35, now “you get that little knock like, ‘Hey, you in your fifties now. Relax.'”

Despite the physical challenges, Fields maintains her signature approach to preparation, or lack thereof. “I clearly didn't do anything with my working out. And I'm not sorry for that either!” she laughed.

Fields' potential retirement comes after a remarkable run across multiple reality franchises. According to Us Weekly, she's widely considered “the greatest reality TV competitor of all time” by fans who have followed her 17-year career spanning different television shows.

Her journey began in 2006 on “Survivor: Panama” when she famously got up off the couch to try reality television. She would go on to play “Survivor” four more times. She competed in the following seasons: “Micronesia,” “Heroes vs. Villains,” “Game Changers,” and the upcoming 50th season, “In the Hands of the Fans.” Jeff Probst has praised her unique abilities, noting her exceptional social skills that allow others to help her even when they know she might eliminate them.

Fields has now also appeared on “Australian Survivor” alongside American legends Parvati Shallow and Tony Vlachos, and the upcoming “Survivor 50” promises to be another memorable chapter. Whether it truly represents her final competitive bow is still uncertain, but her comments suggest she's ready to pass the torch to the next generation of players.

Praise be, another “Pride and Prejudice” is almost here. The buzzy Netflix limited series adaptation of the beloved Jane Austen novel has officially started production in the UK. Emma Corrin is leading the series as Elizabeth Bennet, with “Slow Horses” actor Jack Lowden cast as Mr. Darcy. 

Author Dolly Alderton (“Everything I Know About Love”) wrote the script and “Heartstopper” helmer Euros Lyn is directing. The series has proven to be a “Heartstopper” reunion for Olivia Colman who will play Mrs. Bennet, as well as Rhea Norwood as Lydia Bennet. The Bennet sisterhood will feature Freya Mavor as Jane Bennet and newcomers Hollie Avery and Hopey Parish in their debut roles of Kitty and Mary. “The Diplomat” star Rufus Sewell is Mr. Bennet.

The final cast further includes Louis Partridge as Mr. Darcy's nemesis Mr. Wickham; Daryl McCormack playing Mr. Bingley; Siena Kelly as Caroline Bingley; Jamie Demetriou as Mr. Collins; and the iconic Fiona Shaw as Lady Catherine de Bourg. 

 










Also joining the cast are Anjana Vasan as Mrs. Gardiner, Sebastian Armesto as Mr. Gardiner, Rosie Cavaliero as Lady Lucas, Saffron Coomber as Mrs. Hurst, James Dryden as Mr. Hurst, Justin Edwards as Sir William Lucas, James Northcote as Colonel Forster, Eloise Webb as Harriet Forster, and Isabella Sermon as Georgiana Darcy.

The six-part Netflix series will be a “faithful, classic adaptation” of the novel. Alderton previously said, “Once in a generation, a group of people get to retell this wonderful story and I feel very lucky that I get to be a part of it. Jane Austen's ‘Pride and Prejudice' is the blueprint for romantic comedy – it has been a joy to delve back into its pages to find both familiar and fresh ways of bringing this beloved book to life. With Euros Lyn directing our stellar cast, I am so excited to reintroduce these hilarious and complicated characters to those who count Pride and Prejudice as their favorite book, and those who are yet to meet their Lizzie and Mr. Darcy.”

Corrin, who makes their executive producing debut with the project, continued that bringing their take on Elizabeth Bennet is a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” for any actor. “To be able to bring this iconic character to life, alongside Olivia and Jack, with Dolly's phenomenal scripts, is truly the greatest honor. I can't wait for a new generation to fall in love with this story all over again,” they said.

 










“Pride and Prejudice” is executive produced by Alderton, Lyn, Corrin, and Lookout Point's Laura Lankester, Will Johnston, and Louise Mutter. Lisa Osborne produces. Lookout Point is a BBC Studios company, with recent productions including original adventure series “Renegade Nell” for Disney+, “Happy Valley” (BBC/AMC), “Gentleman Jack” (BBC/HBO), and the first screen adaptation of Vikram Seth's classic novel “A Suitable Boy” for the BBC. Lookout Point is wholly owned by BBC Studios, the main commercial arm of BBC Commercial Ltd.

Elizabeth Olsen is getting her own take on “Defending Your Life” with a love triangle twist. The former MCU star and indie darling leads David Freyne's A24 romantic comedy “Eternity” set in the afterlife. Miles Teller and Callum Turner co-star as Olsen's dead husbands. The film will be released in theaters this November.

The logline reads: “In an afterlife where souls have one week to decide where to spend eternity, Joan (Elizabeth Olsen) is faced with the impossible choice between the man she spent her life with (Miles Teller) and her first love (Callum Turner), who died young and has waited decades for her to arrive.”

 










“Eternity” director Freyne previously helmed 2020 film “Dating Amber.” Olsen and Teller both executive produce “Eternity,” which is debuting at TIFF 2025.

Olsen previously told Bustle that “Eternity” harks back to classic Old Hollywood films. “It's a Billy Wilder type of film,” she said. “It's old school and timeless. It's a warm, heartfelt, funny piece that will make people feel good. It's a special film about how we look back at one's life, both in the end and the entirety of it, not just a moment in time. It's a reflection of the gift of what it is to be alive and who we choose to spend that time with.”

Olsen detailed her decision to expand beyond the superhero genre and return to her indie roots. “I think that is why, because I've spent so many years doing Marvel, that I feel like all the other jobs I have to do have to really reflect my personal taste,” she said during NPR's “Wild Card” podcast, “because as much as I love being a part of this world — and I'm proud of what I've been able to do with the character — it's not really the art that I consume, which I've been very, I think, honest about… Even though I don't seek the word validation, necessarily, I do want this kind of understanding of the bigger picture of me as a creative person in the world and what my goals are. I think [I have to prove] my taste in a creative way. I think I haven't always successfully made choices in my work that are aligned with my personal taste and that is something I feel like I'm still trying to prove when I meet people, especially if it's a work-type meeting.”

Olsen most recently led the film “The Assessment” and is still trying to get Todd Solondz's “Love Child” greenlit after funding for the indie auteur's movie got pulled last-minute in 2024. 

A24 will release “Eternity” in theaters this November. Check out the trailer below.

Matthew McConaughey is returning to the screen with a vengeance. The iconic actor took a six-year break from live-action roles, and now is back with the moving true story of a hero in “The Lost Bus.” 

McConaughey stars as a wayward school bus driver who partners with a dedicated school teacher (America Ferrera) to save 22 children from a terrifying inferno. Yul Vazquez, Spencer Watson, and Ashlie Atkinson also star. The logline reads: “A determined father risks everything to rescue a teacher and her students from a raging wildfire.” 

 










Oscar-nominated “United 93” director Paul Greengrass helms the film which is  inspired by real events. Greengrass and Brad Ingelsby co-wrote the feature, based on the book “Paradise: One Town's Struggle to Survive an American Wildfire” by Lizzie Johnson. Ingelsby, Jason Blum, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Gregory Goodman are producing the Apple Original Film, which the studio deemed a “white-knuckle ride through one of America's deadliest wildfires.” Amy Lord and author Johnson are executive producing.

“The Lost Bus” is McConaughey's second release of 2025; he also led “The Rivals of Amziah King” which premiered in March at SXSW. McConaughey told Variety that his time away from Hollywood led to his love of acting being reinvigorated.

“I remembered a couple of things: One, how much I truly enjoy performing. Two, I remembered, ‘hey, McConaughey, you're pretty damn good at this,'” he said. “And three, I remembered that acting is a vacation for me, and what I mean by vacation is that when I'm performing, it's my singular focus. When I walk out the door in the morning, my wife says, ‘Go kick some ass. I got the kiddos. We're good.' That's vacation. Because I'm not multitasking. I'm not compartmentalizing. I'm fully focused on finding the truth of my character.”

McConaughey is set to reunite with his “True Detective” collaborator Nic Pizzolatto for a “Mike Hammer” feature based on the private investigator character. Pizzolatto wrote the screenplay based on the book series by Mickey Spillane and Max Allan Collins. 

“The Lost Bus” premieres in select theaters on September 19, before debuting globally on Apple TV+ Friday, October 3. Check out the trailer below.

In the film world, there are two Adam Sandlers. There's the goofball, childish buffoon of “Happy Gilmore” and “Billy Madison,” the one audiences have become intimately familiar with through a solid two decades of box office hits and a rapid fire stream of Netflix originals. This Adam Sandler has certainly evolved throughout the years — he's older, occasionally slightly wiser, and often leans more on a grumpy persona in his latest projects — but at this point you know what to expect when you see an Adam Sandler film (and it's worth noting that “Adam Sandler movie” and a movie Adam Sandler is starring in are not the same thing). You can expect some lowest-common denominator humor. You can expect Sandler to be married to or dating an extremely famous and beautiful woman. You can expect a buffet of cameos from his friends and otherwise famous people. And the whole thing probably takes place in a resort or a tropical vacation destination. 

Then there are the few times where Sandler emerges from this comfortable comedic den he's built himself via his Happy Madison production company, and shows how his range and ability as a performer. The first of this type of excursion for Sandler came in 2002's “Punch-Drunk Love,” a film that derived much of its friction and meta narrative from subverting and darkening his manchild image. This Sandler doesn't appear often — you get the sense that Sandler the person is more than content to make films that are fun and occasionally dip his toes into more dramatic waters — but when he does, it's a revelation. The things that make Sandler such a reliable comedic actor, from his high-pitched emotions to his ability to go from 1 to 100 immediately, also make him an excellent dramatic actor. 

Few actors of his generation have as set a star image as Sandler, and no performance he's ever given has strayed too far away from it. The average Sandler character is a relatively successful but profoundly immature man, one who is forced by romance/family/magical universal remote control to slowly but surely grow up. Every film he's ever been in tweaks that same basic template slightly, and the best are often in conversation with it. “Uncut Gems” wouldn't have had its power with any other actor; “Hustle” is a film that was almost entirely built around Sandler's own interests. Whether it's a low-brow comedy or an intense thriller, Sandler knows how to give the people what they want — even if some roles are better than others. 

With “Happy Gilmore 2,” a sequel to one of Sandler's most famous hits, out in theaters now, IndieWire is diving into the actor's filmography to pick the best of the best. Read on for Sandler's 10 best performances, ranked from worst to best.

A delightful, fresh coming-of-age comedy, “You Are So Not Invited To My Bat Mitzvah” sees Adam Sandler step away from the lead role in favor of his daughter Sunny, who plays overdramatic middle schooler Stacy. For the most part, Sandler — as Stacy's supportive father Danny — stays on the sidelines while Stacy deals with crushes, public humiliation, and friendship breakups, popping in to lightly squabble with her over her plans for the perfect Bat Mitzvah. There's something deeply charming about seeing the perpetually childish Sandler take the opportunity to usher in the new generation (it helps that Sunny Sandler is a case of nepotism gone right) through his film, and he's equips himself well in the dad role, all warm smiles and weary wisdom. Who knew “Big Daddy” would one day grow up?

Made as Sandler was preparing to leave “SNL,” “Billy Madison” was the comedian's first big star vehicle, the test to see if he could be one of those breakout stars from the sketch series to translate their success on the show to mainstream movie stardom. At the time, the film was only a moderate commercial success and received largely mixed reviews from critics, but years of cable reruns has made the very silly story of a immature hotel heir forced to repeat grades 1 through 12 one of Sandler's most enduring and famous works. And, while it's certainly thinly written and mostly an excuse for a parade of an adult Sandler going to class with little kids, “Billy Madison” is all things considered a fun charmer, and one that makes good use of Sandler's innate goofball nature. This is a film only he could star in, for better or for worse. 

Sandler has quite possibly never been as lowkey on screen as he is in “Hustle,” a sports dramedy that exists in the halfway point between his serious roles and his “Happy Madison” comedy output. Set in the world of his favorite sport basketball, with a level of detail that makes his love for it evident, “Hustle” follows Sandler's NBA Agent Stanley Sugerman as he attempts to get out of a career rut by betting big on a young, rough-around-the-edges talent (actual Spanish basketball player Juancho Hernangómez). Jeremiah Zager's film surrounds Sandler with tons of real-life NBA stars, which could be jarring if Sandler didn't sink so fully into the world. He's gruff, sarcastic, and believable as this lovable fuck-up, and pretty much carries “Hustle” entirely on his back. 

It had been years since Sandler tried out a more dramatic role when he starred in Noah Baumbach's “The Meyerowitz Stories,” but his standout performance in the ensemble drama helped remind viewers of his talents as an actor when he wants to try. Focusing on four estranged adult siblings who reunite to celebrate their artist father (Dustin Hoffman), the shaggy family comedy has an excellent cast that includes Ben Stiller, Elizabeth Marvel, and Emma Thompson. But Sandler's turn as an unemployed, amicable, slightly resentful unemployed father struggling to find himself was easily the most praised element of the film, and his performance is raw and lovely. Like many of his best performances, it's very much a response to the manchild type of characters that he's famed for, but Sandler finds new notes and a lovely vulnerability as Danny.

The film that arguably fully established Sandler as an outright comedic superstar, “Happy Gilmore” is perhaps his definitive movie, in terms of cementing who he is as a performer and as a movie star. As the title character, he's a short-tempered child of a man, one whose boorish disposition masks a fundamentally good heart. He's a perfect fish-out-of-water for this golf course set comedy, which contrasts his uncouth demeanor with the prim and preppy culture of the sport. The result is one of the actor's most purely funny movies, filled with fun characters and quotable scenes, and it wouldn't work at all without Sandler's performance in the center. Still young and learning the ropes of movie stardom, Sandler gives an impressively energetic performance, one full of rage and fire that Happy has to learn to tame in order to become the best golfer he can be. Watching him succeed at the end is satisfying, but watching him try and fail throughout the movie is what makes it funny.

An absolutely ridiculous bawdy family comedy that morphs into a devastatingly sad examination of the passage of time in its back half, “Click” is the single oddest movie that Sandler has ever made. That oddity resulted in “Click” getting largely dismissed by critics upon its 2006 release, but the film holds up as one of Sandler's most interesting, ambitious showcases. As Michael, a family man who is gifted a magical remote control that lets him fast forward through his life, Sandler is right at home, but he's funnier than usual, fooling around with the remote to give himself a tan or pause time. When the movie gets into the sappier material — as Michael's use of the remote destroys his relationship with his loved ones — Sandler delivers, pretty much singlehandedly making the film's pivot into sincere emotion work. When the film's big weepy moment, where Michael witnesses himself brush off his father on their last meeting, arrives, Sandler's tearful response is what makes it such a gut punch. Yes, “Click” is 100% pure grade schmaltz, but you're not human if you don't cry watching it. 

One of Sandler's least successful films, grossing $71 million against a $75 million budget, “Funny People” also features the star's most underrated performance. On its surface, the Judd Apatow film is typical of the hangout comedies that made him one of Hollywood's most successful directors in the late 2000s, following a popular comic as he takes an up-and-comer under his wing. But there's a disarming edge to “Funny People” that makes it stand out, and Sandler's highly self-referential performance as George Simmons — a comedian who rose to the A-list thanks to lowbrow comedy films — is key to what makes the movie work. There's certainly some vulnerability to Simmons, but at his core, he's a pill, and Sandler leans into his more unpleasant character traits to extremely compelling effect. Even as the film lurches to a sweet conclusion, Sandler remains fundamentally sour in the role, and the contrast between Simmons' charm and his rougher nature makes for an effective, surprising character study. 

Sandler has starred in a ton of romantic comedies, but few are particularly romantic. That is, except for “The Wedding Singer,” a movie that remarkably manages to sell the goofy “SNL” star as a poofy haired heartthrob. It helps that Sandler's performance as the titular crooner with a broken heart is matched by Drew Barrymore's effervescent sunniness as the target of his affections, a bride-to-be who enlists him to sing at her wedding. The two — who reunited with “50 First Dates” a few years later — just make sense together, with the same slightly childish quality that makes their romance so infectious. Not the most plotty of rom-coms, “The Wedding Singer” is mostly an excuse to pair the two together while giving Sandler a bunch of '80s references to parrot off. That it works so fantastically, and is such a joy to watch, is a testament to the star power of the leads, and Sandler's go-for-broke performance, arguably his first time portraying a real person instead of a cartoon. 

For years, “Punch-Drunk Love” felt like a strange glitch in Adam Sandler's filmography, a dark twist on his star image and the only real time he departed from his usual comedic formula. With more recent ambitious turns from Sandler, it now stands as the first of many layered dramatic works from the star, and one of the best. Paul Thomas Anderson's film is a romantic comedy, but a deeply wounded one, and while Sandler's Barry fits the general manchild character Sandler has made his own, the film is much more invested in the pain underneath the bluster, asking genuinely difficult questions about whether he can truly forge a healthy relationship with Emily Watson's Lena. Anderson famously genuinely loved Sandler's films before making “Punch-Drunk Love,” and there's real affection for Sandler's movies that shines through in the ultimately happy conclusion. Still, Sandler had never been remotely as vulnerable or as interesting as he is here, locating a throbbing wounded spirit underneath the archetype he's long made his own. 

People knew Sandler was a great actor long before he starred in “Uncut Gems.” “Punch-Drunk Love,” “Funny People,” and other assorted titles were proof enough. But the Safdie brothers' dark thriller was the first time Sandler became “robbed of an Oscar nomination”-level good in the eyes of the general populace, with many a cinephile bemoaning how the Academy passed up an opportunity to recognize his sweaty, panicked turn as gambling addict Howard Ratner. And the outrage was well-founded, because Sandler gave the most commanding and compelling performance he's ever put onscreen. The viewpoint character of the Safdie's odyssey through New York gambling circles, as he attempts to scrounge up the money needed to pay off his debts, Howard on the surface is a profoundly unappealing person, but Sandler — with a thick New York accent and his scruffy beard — somehow makes the sleezeball someone you want to root for. And he's electrifying as the center of the film's madness, portraying the desperation and rush of an addict with a real sense that Howard might self-destruct at any moment. It's the only one of Sandler's roles that's truly, genuinely transformative, a performance that shows the full range of what he's capable of.

The future of creativity must be nurtured. It must be cultivated. It must be invested in.

That's what Adobe does every year as the sponsor of the Young Lions competitions at the annual Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity that takes place each June. Now celebrating its 30th anniversary, Young Lions brought together nearly 460 emerging professionals this year from 67 markets worldwide for their Design, Digital, Film, Media, Marketers, PR, and Print competitions. While on the Croisette they form new connections, learn from industry icons and thought leaders, and develop a community that they can bring with them into their future careers.

Stacy Martinet, VP, Marketing & Chief Communications Officer of Adobe said, “Young Lions is the best part of Cannes Lions. The brightest creatives gather to figure out what kind of world they're going to make. It's a privilege to be a part of their journey.”

Gold, Silver, and Bronze awards are given out to the winners in each category, and for the first time ever Turkey won Gold in the Marketers competition, while Guatemala won its first prize overall, taking Gold in Film.



“Adobe's partnership with Young Lions is so incredible,” Martinet said. “All of us at Adobe get so much out of it. Just seeing how these creatives are thinking, working, what motivates them. And also them making our tools better.”

Each of the competitors in all of the categories use Adobe tools such as Firefly, Adobe Stock, and Express to bring their ideas to life. A panel of professional judges awards the prizes, and each category is partnered with an external brand to create a unique activation for that brand in the respective discipline: Ovarian Cancer Action asked the film competitors to create a powerful, uplifting 60-second film for World Ovarian Cancer Day, and asked the media competitors about how to better engage their audience to inspire positive change; the Museum of Art & Photography India challenged Young Lions in the Design section to create visual storytelling that illustrates how comic storytelling is more than a Western, child-centric medium.

Pakistan's Pazirish Zehra Mirza, shortlisted in the 2025 Marketers category said she most appreciates Young Lions for its “bold ideas. The kind of ideas that we wouldn't do in normal, real life. Over here, you can just think really big. The sky's the limit, you can basically do anything and everything that you want.” Her countryman and fellow competition team member Muhammad Ibrahim added, “Whatever you believe… you can do it here.”



Alums of the program can't sing its praises enough. Brazil's Marcelo Bruzzesi, a 2025 Jury member said, “I was a Young Lion in 2011. It was so important for my career, so important for these young talents.”

Cannes Lions' CEO, Simon Cook said, “The many hundreds and thousands of people that have been through that program have fed back to us every year just how important it is to have that access to industry legends, who give them the tools they need to propel their careers forward.”

Also among those tools? Adobe's suite of essential products for creators. With Adobe's tools and the vision of the Young Lions, the future of creativity isn't murky at all. It's full of promise. And it's not even that far off.

“‘Kaleidoscopic Visions' was the first piece I wrote for the album,” Skinner said of his new single. “Based around an intuitive piano improvisation, it set the tone for my approach and the sound I wanted to achieve in the creative process. Showcasing the conversational and collaborative dynamic of the music and my band, it foregrounds a moody, cinematic flow within a hazy, psychedelic backdrop.”

Skinner made Kaleidoscopic Visions—his first album since 2022's Voices of Bishara and its live companion—with bassist Tom Herbert, cellist Kareem Dayes, and woodwinds players Robert Stillman and Chelsea Carmichael. In addition, Portishead's Adrian Utley plays electric guitar on two songs, while Meshell Ndegeocello is on “The Maxim” and Contour's Khari Lucas features on “Logue.”

Nashville egg-punks Snõõper have announced a new album. Worldwide is out on October 3 via Third Man, marking their second full-length for the label. Snõõper are sharing the title track from the LP today along with a music video, too, and you can watch below.

Worldwide is the first record that Snõõper have ever made with a producer, with the group tapping John Congleton to do the honors over in Los Angeles. The final product is 12 songs long that turn the focus from random external objects to singer Blair Tramel's personal experiences in the world. In Snõõper's eyes, Worldwide feels more like their true debut album because 2023's Super Snõõper was a re-recorded collection of their pre-existing material. These new songs, by comparison, had less time to be road-tested and adored by fans.

In the years since Snõõper released Super Snõõper on Third Man, they've also put out a few singles, a split with Prison Affair in 2024, and the Unknown Caller EP earlier this year.

Nourished by Time has shared a video for “Baby Baby,” the new single from his incoming album The Passionate Ones. Check it out below.

Nourished by Time's Marcus Brown directed the video himself, setting his acerbic assessment of the American Dream at the New Jersey entertainment complex of the same name. “If you can bomb Palestine/You can bomb Mondawmin,” Brown raps in the song, referencing the Baltimore neighborhood and shopping mall where Freddie Gray was arrested in 2015 before being killed in police custody.

Brown's Erotic Probiotic 2 follow-up and XL debut, The Passionate Ones arrives August 22, backed by a tour of North America and Europe that kicks off in his hometown of Baltimore in September. After the last record, Brown arrived on XL with the EP Catching Chickens. Recent singles “Max Potential” and “9 2 5” feature on the new LP.

On August 5, Brown will host a 24-hour livestream on his YouTube page, described as a series of “sounds, collaborations, and unfolding moments.”

Thundercat has announced a North American tour set to take place this autumn. After wrapping up a leg in South America this August, the singer-bassist will take a pause before getting back on the road, beginning on October 15 in in Atlanta. From there, he performs in Miami, Philadelphia, Toronto, Chicago, and a few more cities. Check out Thundercat's complete list of tour dates below.

It's been five years since Thundercat last released an album, his most recent being 2020's It Is What It Is. Lately, he's instead been reissuing records from his past catalog, including a special 10th-anniversary version of Apocalypse that rolled out in 2023.

Nevertheless, there's still plenty of new music with his stamp on it. These past few years, Thundercat has stayed busy by joining Tame Impala's Kevin Parker for the single “No More Lies,” and collaborating with other artists like Vic Mensa, Kaytranada, Gorillaz, and Haim. He also recorded a short track on behalf of Listerine to promote the company's campaign on reducing racial disparities in dental health.

It's getting weird out here, isn't it? “Out here” meaning “in here,” meaning wherever you are, on whatever tech this is reaching you, smeared between the transmissions of our national glory and terror, watered in drying data-center creek beds and hitting like so much blood-drizzled chocolate delivered (via drone) straight into our open mouths. “Apocalypse” means “unveiling,” after all, and the more of America we Americans show ourselves, the more inexorable the call to the floor of the high-vaulting revival tent, to join the danse macabre where we become what we already are.

If any of this has your pineal gland resonating, Cory Hanson has made a record for you. I Love People is a superb pastiche of contemporary Americana, one that could slip between Harry Nilsson and Steely Dan LPs without raising a Laurel Canyon audiophile's eyebrow. But it's more surreal and blacker in tone than its Watergate antecedents. In 2025, with stormtroopers in the strawberry fields and bombs falling like curtains over Gaza, Hanson wraps his alienation in a bearhug of agape, crafting songs not so much ripped from the headlines as forged from the paradoxical emotions the headlines rip from us.

The sparkling, country-gold “Bird on a Swing” opens the album at a gallop, its full arrangement courtesy of the brothers-in-arms in Hanson's main band, Wand. Historically a guitar pyrotechnician, Hanson composed I Love People largely on the piano, lending the album a jaunty saloon sound that strikes a sharp contrast with the buzzing moonscape of Wand's 2024 Vertigo. With his crisp, unwavering croon, Hanson's pro forma barstool defiance hides something rotten in plain sight: “I have no blood left in my veins/I gave it all up to the empire.” Our free bird may be a shellshocked casualty of the forever war, the titular swing a noose.

The specter of mission creep only looms more steadily from here. Hanson, conversant in the idioms of the paranoid left, lines his prairies with tripwires to flicker from Chihuahua to Afghanistan and back again. And while the blank, crosshairs-trained grimace on the album's cover is a gesture of bipartisan misanthropy, I Love People still feels like a scourging of the late Biden regime's folksy grin. The uncanny ripples that disturb its self-consciously nostalgic yacht rock evoke a return to hegemonic normalcy gone wrong, as on the title track's glandhanding threepenny sway (“I love people/With incurable disease...”). At length, the album plays like a soundtrack to a movie veering uncontrollably into snuff: no yuletide peace for the returning veteran in “Santa Claus is Coming Back to Town,” while the playboy of closer “On the Rocks” ditches his KKK buddies (if not his heartbreak) for dangerous game on an island that may well be Little St. James.

While Hanson's previous solo album took an auto-critical tour of hypermasculine rock, I Love People treats maleness as a theme more loosely—its crisis suddenly vivid in a flash of violence amidst the soft-rock counterfeiteur of “Joker” or the haunted fadeout that finds an “Old Policeman” headed for a liaison with an escort of questionable age. All the while, Hanson frames these baroque horrors within resplendent production and Harvest-like orchestral swells.

Irony and easy melody spur I Love People's best songs beyond tribute or satire towards a lived-in equilibrium. “Bad Miracles,” a ballad of intrusive superstitions, plane crashes, and falling pianos, follows a hypnotic vocal line into a cliff-scraping guitar solo. “Texas Weather” has all the melancholy swagger of vintage Jackson Browne (and a handful of nods to the Eagles), but its striking poetic images are the hallucination of a Mansonesque madman.

Hanson reserves his sincerity for centerpiece “Lou Reed,” a short lyric letter to the poète maudit of New York City, antipode of the sun-soaked FM set. Inveterate showman and SoCal art-jock, Hanson is still drawn instinctively to this sour, fame-eschewing antihero. What this gentle nocturne seems to ask for is the source, at the heart of all the upheavals—Reed's and Hanson's and ours too—of a sense of peace. The suggestion, by way of an epitaph from Laurie Anderson, is a rather Californian one: “You were a prince and a fighter/And you were a tai chi master.” Hanson knows we might be on our own, but the teachers are out here too.

	On Monday evening, a gunman entered the lobby of a midtown Manhattan building and began firing a rifle, fatally shooting four people, including a New York City police officer, before killing himself, authorities said. A fifth victim was critically wounded but is in stable condition, said New York City Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch.


	The police officer killed in the attack was Didarul Islam, 36, who was working in a private security role at the time and was an immigrant from Bangladesh, Mayor Eric Adams said at a news conference. Officer Islam was married and had two young boys, said Tisch; his wife is pregnant with their third child.


	“He made the ultimate sacrifice, shot in cold blood, wearing a uniform that stood for the promise that he made to this city,” said Tisch at the conference. “He died as he lived, a hero.”


	One male and one female were brought to Bellevue Hospital and died, and another woman was found dead on the 33rd floor of the building, said the commissioner. The lone shooting survivor, a male, is in critical but stable condition, and was transported to New York Presbyterian Hospital.

	











	“Four other victims being treated for minor injuries sustained in their attempts to flee the scene,” Tisch continued, adding that the names of the civilian victims are being withheld until family notification.


	Tisch said that the gunman is believed to be Shane Devon Tamura, a 27-year-old male with a Las Vegas address. Tamura traveled cross-country, leaving Nevada and driving through Colorado on July 26 before entering New York City, said the commissioner. Police searched the gunman's car and found multiple items including a loaded revolver, a rifle case, and prescription medication. “Inside of that vehicle, officers found a rifle case with rounds, a loaded revolver, ammunition and magazines, a backpack, and medication prescribed to Mr. Tamura,” she said. 

	











	The gunman has a documented mental health history, said Tisch. He died after shooting himself in the chest on the 33rd floor, the commissioner confirmed. His motives are currently under investigation.


	According to ABC News, police discovered a note in Tamura's pocked stating that he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. The document reportedly mentioned the NFL, which has an office in the building the gunman entered, as well. “He appeared to have blamed the NFL for his injury,” Adams told CBS, adding: “From our preliminary investigation, he took the wrong elevator bank up to the NFL headquarters. Instead, it took him to Rudin Management, and that is where he carried out additional shootings and took the lives of additional employees.”

H
er skeleton lay in the open air. 


	When they first approached the site, in the desert of Sunland Park, New Mexico, in August 2024, the volunteer search party found a body dispersed across the landscape, a rib here, a leg bone there. An intact jawbone sat crooked on the ground. 


	The scene was tragic, but all too commonplace. Over the past three years, the Battalion Search and Rescue group has documented an exponential rise in skeletal remains belonging to migrants, found near a New Mexico suburb.


	The area is a triangle of desert, just 25 square miles, where two borders meet: U.S.-Mexico and Texas-New Mexico, a 20 minute drive from El Paso, Texas. In the past three years, volunteer search parties and authorities have found over 500 human bodies here, on U.S. soil. 


	The remains belong to migrants who walked through the desert with smugglers, and ostensibly died of dehydration after crossing the border. Most are desperate people, fleeing violence or persecution, risking their lives for a better future. Local immigrant advocacy organizations argue that restrictive asylum policies, enacted first under Joe Biden and now under Donald Trump, are driving these deaths, while systemic negligence from local authorities hides them from view. 




	This particular skeleton sat in the dust for over a year. It belonged to a 31-year-old woman named Ada Guadalupe López Montoya, who traveled to the border from rural El Salvador in June 2023, with her husband and toddler, seeking safety in the United States. Unlike most remains found in the area, Ada's skeleton was successfully identified because the search group found her ID near the bones. I have spent the past year piecing together her story in an effort to understand why she and so many others have died here. 




	Two years ago, Ada, her husband, Reynaldo, and their three-year-old son traveled 2,000 miles from San Salvador to Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, in just 10 days, hidden in smugglers' vehicles, bribing their way through Guatemalan and Mexican immigration checkpoints.

	But when they got to Juárez, their last stop before entering the U.S., the smugglers went off script. 


	“Something was off from the start,” Ada's sister, Pati Montoya, says in an interview. The coyotes informed the migrants that their family would need to split up. Each would cross into the United States through varied channels over a period of several days. 


	Separating was something the couple vowed they would never do. 


	There was another catch: The couple would need to pay an extra $2,000 if they wanted their toddler to cross the border in the safest manner possible. Without options, the pair acquiesced, miserably. 


	Under the new plan, Ada's husband, Reynaldo, would walk first through the desert with a group of other migrants and wait in a safehouse in El Paso. Then, a few days later, their son would slip through a vehicle checkpoint, posing as the child of a U.S. citizen. Ada would be last to cross the border, alone with the smuggler. 


	On the eve of her departure, Ada called Pati, back in El Salvador, to say she was afraid the hike through the desert would be too strenuous. The unexpected separation from her husband and son, the continued stress of trusting shifty smugglers, the possibility of being caught by Border Patrol agents, all had knotted together into panic. “I don't think I'm going to make it,” she said through tears.

	On June 27, 2023, temperatures neared 110 degrees. Ada sent a text message to Pati, at 1:30 p.m., saying she was about to cross the border. This was the last time she would communicate with her family. When Ada did not arrive at the safehouse that night, the coyotes told Reynaldo that she had been picked up by Border Patrol agents in the desert after crossing over the border wall. After a few days, they stopped responding to the family's questions. 


	In the weeks and months that followed, Ada's family endured a painful combination of grief and disbelief. They contacted a Mexican organization called Armadillos that puts out social media alerts about missing migrants. After Ada's image was posted on Facebook, the family received messages from unknown numbers, promising information on Ada's whereabouts, for a fee. These people offered photo evidence, and the family paid several hundred dollars to one man, who then went silent. 




	Ada's husband, Reynaldo, and their son moved in with relatives in Los Angeles, and attempted to assimilate as new, undocumented arrivals, while contending with Ada's loss, without knowing what became of her. She simply hadn't shown up at the meeting point. “Sometimes I would think there's no way she's alive,” Reynaldo says in an interview. 


	Because identifying documents are so rarely found in the desert, most families never learn what happened to their missing loved ones who disappear at the border. 


	The Montoya family waited for two years for confirmation of Ada's death, delivered through a collective effort between Battalion Search and Rescue, the Armadillos search group, and me. 


	Ada would have been unaccustomed to media attention, though she was something of a local celebrity in the hamlet where she grew up: She was the woman who made the best tortillas. “She had that touch — not just anyone can flip tortillas,” her sister Pati says in an interview in her home in El Salvador. “When I helped her at the tortilla stand, people would approach me, mistaking me for her. She made lots of friends, she would talk to anyone and everyone.”


	The Montoya family has lived for generations in a caserío, a few cinder block houses with corrugated tin roofs, off a narrow back road, an hour and a half outside San Salvador. Ada was one of ten children, and grew up tossed from one family member's home to another. She started working after finishing the sixth grade. “She never had childhood dreams,” Pati says. “What dream could she have had?”


	El Salvador in the '90s and early 2000s was consumed by gang violence that touched every community, no matter how rural. In 2018, Pati says, during the last few years of the gang wars, Ada would find herself imprisoned for 72 hours by local police — she was falsely accused of being a gang member. The charges were dismissed by a judge, but at the hearing, over a hundred people showed up to express their support for the tortilla maker. 


	In 2019, Nayib Bukele, a far-right authoritarian, assumed the presidency in El Salvador. He issued a “state of exception” in 2022, effectively pausing due process — meaning that anyone picked up by the police could be imprisoned for any length of time without trial. Over the next two years, authorities arrested 80,000 people, who became a shadow, carceral population, confined to maximum security prisons with no means of contacting family and no legal process with which to appeal their sentences. 




	There was an immediate decline in gang violence, so despite the young men missing from nearly every community — many if not the majority of them innocent of any crimes — Bukele retains near universal approval in El Salvador. 


	In early 2023, rumors spread through the village that anyone with a prior criminal charge would soon be rounded up by the local police, even if the charge had been overturned by a judge. The prison sentence would be at least ten years. Ada and the others implicated in the 2018 complaint began, one by one, to flee. One of Ada's brothers found the contact of a smuggler, and the siblings put their mother's house up as collateral for a loan so Ada, her husband, and son could have the $44,000 dollars necessary to make it to the United States.


	Ada was attempting to escape a future in the same Salvadoran prison system where President Donald Trump famously sent a group of 250 Venezuelan migrants without due process, and against their will, in March 2025.


	The last anyone knows of Ada's mental state in the final days of her life is from her phone calls with Pati. Once she was separated from her husband, Reynaldo, they could not communicate, except through proof-of-life videos sent by the smugglers. Alone in Ciudad Juárez, Pati says, Ada began to suffer from hunger pangs, and the coyote was in a state of volatile annoyance, because Ada had protested about the separation from her husband and son. Ada implied that the coyote was also drugged. There were no other migrants slated to cross the border on June 27. For the duration of the hike through the desert, she would be alone with the smuggler. 


	“I told her everything was going to be OK, and to have faith,” Pati says.


	In the hours before she died, Ada's goal was to get over the border wall and walk between three and five miles through the open desert, from the wall to a pickup point, a suburban parking lot, where a getaway car would be waiting. 


	It is in this no man's land — between the border wall and the suburbs, on U.S. soil — where the bodies are found. 


	Ada's death was part of a larger pattern. For the past two years, local nonprofit No More Deaths has marked each discovery of human remains at the Texas-New Mexico border on a map with a red dot. Now, a triangle glows next to Sunland Park. 


	Bryce Peterson, a volunteer with the nonprofit, started making the map in the summer of 2023, but says the deaths began to spike the previous year. He says that “2022 was the beginning of this kind of explosion,” describing the territory as a “black hole.” 




	Since then, the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator has tripled their staff of medical examiners to account for the hundreds of skeletons found at the border. 


	Sometimes a body is just a single bone, the search groups explain. Sometimes it has eyes and hair, and was alive just days before. Occasionally, two skeletons are found together, side by side. Nearby, there is often clothing, miscellaneous personal items like watches and hairbrushes, and bottles of water.


	Sometimes, bodies are found in the backyards of suburban homes. “In the town, in areas where people are on ATVs and walking around, and where there are buildings, there are skeletal remains,” Peterson says. 


	This area is one of the shortest and flattest smuggling routes at the U.S. border, but temperatures top 100 degrees through the summer. And the terrain is a hall of mirrors. The ground, which is a uniform khaki, erupts into small dunes, but there are no visible hills which could be used to aid in navigation. There are dry shrubs, but no trees to provide shade. 


	The migrants who cross through this territory also need to avoid Border Patrol agents and their surveillance technologies, which include footprint tracking, AI imaging towers, and even a blimp. On an average day, Border Patrol picks up anywhere from zero to 500 migrants in this area to be deported to their home countries. Since Trump's inauguration, the numbers have been very low. 


	The border wall is 30 feet high, and coyotes either use rope ladders to go over the top, or cut square tunnels through the metal grating between the bars, leaving quilt-like patches on its surface.


	After she made it over the border wall, Ada would have begun to trudge through the dust of the triangle in the 106-degree afternoon heat, past the cattle ranches, past the AI surveillance towers, past the discarded hoodies and water bottles left by migrants. She may have walked past other migrants' remains.


	“The soil is very sandy. When you walk out there, it's going to pull at your feet, it's going to fill up your shoes,” says Abbey Carpenter, one of the leaders of the Battalion Search and Rescue brigade. 


	Near the wall, Ada might have encountered a metal beacon with a sign in both English and Spanish saying: “If you need help, push the red button. Border Patrol will arrive shortly. Do not leave the area.” 




	Between three and four miles in, something must have changed. Maybe she twisted her ankle, or developed sunstroke, or encountered a snake. Maybe she was severely dehydrated and fatigued. Whatever it was, she needed to move more slowly, and that wasn't going to work for the coyote, whose objective was to transport her through the territory as quickly as possible without getting caught. The smuggler, a Mexican national, could have faced prison time as well as deportation if caught by U.S. authorities and charged with human trafficking. 


	In the weeks that followed Ada's disappearance, her family made contact with the coyote. He sent a text saying Ada “didn't want to walk” and he “wasn't a babysitter,” insinuating that he had left her behind. 


	“They treat you almost like an object,” says Reynaldo, Ada's husband.


	Suddenly, Ada was alone in the desert. She was just a mile and a half from the highway, and three miles from the suburbs. We don't know if she attempted to find help, or if she was physically incapacitated. Pati believes the coyote may have killed her himself. 


	Cesar Ortigoza, one of the leaders of the Armadillos search group, describes the place where the skeleton was found as “lonely,” with very little shade, just a small bush, and few signs of civilization nearby. The medical examiners, in their report, said the site was “vacant.” 


	Pati stayed up all night, waiting for confirmation that Ada had arrived and made contact with their sister Isabel, but the call never came. In a safehouse in New Mexico, the coyotes told Reynaldo that Ada had been picked up by Border Patrol. “They made so many excuses,” he says. But months after the disappearance, he continued to believe she might be in custody and unable to communicate. “She was already on this side,” Reynaldo explains. “And that area of New Mexico is so heavily patrolled.”


	“Sometimes I feel like I'm in denial. But she would have found a way to communicate with us by now,” Pati tells me in December 2024. 


	A 2021 study estimated it would take a non-pregnant woman, on average, a day and a half to die of dehydration in the conditions of the borderlands in summer. Much of that time would be spent moving in and out of a tenuous consciousness, swimming through overlapping states of euphoria, confusion, loss of identity, and a fragmented sense of time and place. There would be an incremental shutdown of bodily functions. 




	At some time between June 27 and June 29, 2023, Ada's body became one with the sand.


	It takes three to six months for human remains to skeletonize in the desert, and by that point, a forensic anthropologist can tell general age and biological sex, but all evidence that could be used to determine a cause of death has been forfeited to the air. 


	“It's just unbelievably dry. Birds, coyotes, animals will get to things really quickly… it's like a solar oven,” says Peterson, the No More Deaths volunteer. 


	The members of Battalion Search and Rescue are not forensic anthropologists, but when they found Ada's bones in August 2024, they thought the skeleton belonged to a woman. Sitting in the dust, at some distance, was a purple backpack. James Holeman and Abbey Carpenter, the pair of retirees who leads the brigade, said many of the skeletons in the desert look, in terms of the aesthetics of their clothing and other items, like they might belong to women. 


	No More Deaths reported the same findings in their database, which includes the sites found by authorities as well as search groups: Between 2022 and 2024, over 55 percent of remains found in the triangle were female, compared to 18 percent in previous years (similar to other sections of the border, where the vast majority of remains belong to men). Peterson calls the number “astonishing.” 


	Local Border Patrol agents estimate that 85 percent of the migrants they encounter in the area are single men, so for Holeman and Carpenter, the growing prevalence of women's items, like bras, jewelry, and hair ties, accompanying the bones, raised questions.


	Heidi Cerneka, a lawyer representing trafficking victims in El Paso, says in recent years she has met at least three clients, young women from Mexico and Central America, who were drugged in this area of the New Mexico desert and deposited at ranches where they endured abuse at the hands of American clientele. But Cerneka does not believe most of the skeletons belong to trafficking victims.


	Battalion Search and Rescue and local Border Patrol officers say it is more likely the deaths in the triangle are cases of abandonment, migrants left behind by their smugglers when they are unable to walk fast enough to keep up with a group and evade authorities. Landon Hutchins, a Border Patrol spokesman, says that sometimes the coyotes even confiscate water, to ensure a slow migrant will die quickly, protecting a smuggling route from detection. “We've found children as young as one-year-olds abandoned,” he says.




	In the post-pandemic era, demand for smuggling is high as migrants flee violence and economic pressures across Latin America. Criminal groups in nearby Juárez, Mexico, are inundated with business (making $10,000 to $20,000 per person), and slower migrants, a higher percentage of them women, could be falling through the cracks. It doesn't matter to the cartel if a migrant makes it in one piece: They have already paid. 


	Desperate people arrive in Juárez exhausted, and migrants who have stayed in cartel safehouses say they are given one can of food a day. “They're holding crossers for longer on the other side,” local Sheriff Kim Stewart says in an interview. “They're dehydrated, they haven't eaten for days.” 


	Hutchins said people are “expiring within a mile” of beginning their hike from the wall, dying from a combination of heat, fatigue, and the smugglers' disregard for human life. 


	Battalion Search and Rescue says this indifference towards the lives of migrants is not exclusive to the coyotes, but touches local authorities and the general public as well, as if the human remains were part of the natural landscape, the deaths a part of some inevitable cycle. 


	When migrants die, Battalion Search and Rescue says, there is no incentive for New Mexico authorities to remove the bones. Holeman and Carpenter returned to the site where they found Ada's skeleton in September 2024, a month after they reported it to the authorities, and medical examiners had not yet arrived to retrieve the remains. 


	Twisted on the ground was a pair of black Adidas track pants. Holeman says he could tell, from the smell of decay, that the deceased had been wearing them. In the process of decomposition, which is often aided by wild animals, the bones had found their way out. In one pocket of the pants was a wallet, bearing a Salvadoran ID. The face was blurred, after a year melting in the desert, but you could still make out Ada's name. 


	It is rare, Holeman says, but sometimes the search group finds identifying information degrading alongside its owner — IDs, passports, birth certificates, their colors running together in the heat. They serve as haunting evidence that the bones found in the desert belonged to real people. 


	“There's no mention [in the media] of what we find in the desert, which is like bibles, and love notes, and keychains with pictures of little kids, and all these clothes,” Holeman says. Instead, what Americans hear is “all this ‘invasion' bullshit,” he adds, referring to the right-wing talking point, espoused by Trump and conservative media, that migrants are war-hardened criminals, rather than everyday people fighting to survive. 




	Holeman and Carpenter have noticed a pattern when they return to sites previously reported to authorities: There are always bones left behind. 


	“I'm not talking about teeny tiny bone fragments. I'm talking like big femurs and jaw bones,” Holeman says.


	Holeman and Carpenter see this behavior as part of a broader carelessness towards the lives of migrants on the part of authorities. Sometimes, Carpenter says, when they call in a discovery, deputies from the Sheriff's Office say they don't have the appropriate vehicles available. Carpenter makes a point of driving across the desert in her Prius. 


	The couple, along with a group of volunteers, does one search each month in the New Mexico borderlands, often walking up to 10 miles through the desert in tight switchbacks. They have found 24 bodies in the past 18 months. 


	Holeman, a 59-year-old former marine, sees Battalion Search and Rescue as a form of vigilante justice against a broken and oppressive system. “I was in the military, and this is exactly what we do: We dehumanize a group, a country, its citizens, make a face for them, so it's OK to kill them — lots of them. This is the kind of language in the approach to migrants now, where they're dying by the thousands and we're just turning our backs because they've been ‘othered' so successfully,” Holeman says. 


	Last fall, the emotional weight of what he had discovered over years in the desert, and the isolation implied by the authorities' neglect of the sites he found, began to take their toll on Holeman, who started taking antidepressants to cope. 


	“It's an incredible, awful, open graveyard,” he says. 


	But U.S. authorities are not the only forces of negligence. In September 2024, Holeman says he contacted the Salvadoran embassy about Ada's ID. The embassy went on to tell the Montoya family that the bones were already in their custody, when in reality, the bones were still sitting in the dust. They would not be removed until November 2024, three months after they were found.


	The medical examiner's report said they collected two femurs, a tibia, a mandible, several ribs, and a few smaller bones, as well as a mat of dark hair, a pair of pants, a wallet, two cellphones, and a sock. 


	For five months, Ada's body waited in purgatory, caught between competing bureaucracies. 


	Isabel Montoya, one of Ada's sisters, still believed it was possible another migrant stole Ada's pants, with the ID inside, and died in them, while Ada remained alive, but pantless. 




	But on April 16, a DNA test confirmed that the remains belonged to Ada. Three weeks later, when I obtained a record of the test, the Salvadoran government had not yet revealed the result to the Montoya family. “The past few months, I still hoped she was alive,” Pati tells me. 


	Pati says she doesn't know what to do with Ada's home, now that her death is confirmed. “I think I'll just leave everything where it is,” she says. 


	Though it has been two years, Ada and Reynaldo's home in El Salvador appears as if they left the day before. The half-open suitcases and trash bags full of clothing and children's toys imply a frantic rush to pack. There are photographs from every stage of Ada's life, lying face-up on a shelf, a woman's slippers, sitting on a plastic rack, and a child's toy car, nestled in the weeds outside. 


	Repatriating Ada's bones will be another bureaucratic odyssey, but the family plans to bury her in the local cemetery. 


	In a few years, Reynaldo says, he will tell his son the full truth — but for now, his mother “can't be there with him right now, but is in a nice place, where God is protecting her.”


	Peterson, the No More Deaths volunteer, refers to that summer of 2023 as “deadly,” because so many remains, a total of 73, were found in the Sunland Park area. No More Deaths published a report in March 2024, arguing that the rise in migrant deaths in Sunland Park, and the overrepresentation of women among the deceased, was the result of the Biden administration's restrictive asylum policies. 


Nearly a million people traveled to the Juárez-El Paso borderline between January 2022 and December 2024, to ask the U.S. government for shelter and protection. Many were families with small children, fleeing violence and economic instability in their home countries. 


	When it became functionally difficult to seek asylum due to restrictive policies, more migrants were pushed into the hands of smugglers. Peterson believes many of the people who walked through the triangle over the past three years never intended to cross the desert in the first place — instead, it was a “last ditch effort to bypass the asylum process altogether,” he says.


	In June 2024, Biden signed an executive order limiting all access to the asylum process between ports of entry, the primary way migrants were asking for asylum. On Trump's first day in office, the president signed an order freezing asylum access altogether, even at official ports. Now, there is no path to seek asylum in the United States, a reality most experts agree contradicts both national and international law. 




	In its 2024 report, the United Nations' Missing Migrants Project wrote: “Migrant deaths and disappearances are preventable. The unprecedented number of lives lost in the last two years, and the fact that more than half of all missing migrants recorded since 2014 are linked to crisis-affected countries, bear witness to one of the greatest political failures of modern times.”


	Local Border Patrol agents say that since Biden signed the fateful executive order in June 2024, and further since Trump was inaugurated, migration through the triangle has trickled to a near standstill. “Morale is high,” says Hutchins, the Border Patrol spokesman. “Now we can focus on interior enforcement.”


	But Peterson notes that the beginning of the first Trump administration saw a similar decline, and then people began crossing the border again, out of pure necessity. He worries that summer 2025 will see the beginning of a new wave, and hundreds more could die in the triangle. Hundreds more people like Ada, abandoned by impatient smugglers, lost, and evaporating into the beige of the desert.


	But this year, the community is watching. Alarmed by the volume of remains discovered, the local Catholic Church began organizing water bottle drops in the triangle, and in January 2025, the El Paso County Commissioners voted unanimously to approve a resolution facilitating solutions to address the deaths. 


	The territory is also facing new challenges. In April 2025, President Trump designated a 170-mile strip of the border wall, including the base of the triangle, as part of the New Mexico National Defense Area, transferring the land from the Bureau of Land Management to the military.


	Sheriff Stewart says this decision has disrupted the work of every agency in the New Mexican borderlands. “We operate by hard and fast rules, and when there are none, we're all just kind of staring at each other,” she says. 


	The sheriff is certain a tragedy will occur as a result, like someone falling off the wall and dying, and none of the authorities present knowing who to call. “There's no excuse,” she says. 


	Trump also authorized troops to detain migrants within the military zone as part of their official capacity. Hundreds of migrants have already been arrested on double trespassing charges, though in June, a judge dismissed over a hundred of these charges. 


	“Any ‘illegal' attempting to enter that zone is entering a military base,” Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said in an announcement on social media platforms.




	“When people talk about illegal crossings, what's illegal is us forcing them to make the choice to cross over the wall through the desert,” says Cerneka, the lawyer representing trafficking victims. “A certain number of them will die, and that's supposed to make the rest of them not want to do it, but the power of desperation and hope cannot be underestimated.”

	Hundreds of unidentified remains found in the triangle remain in storage, unclaimed, and hundreds more, likely, sit on the desert floor, and may never be discovered. 


	More bodies are out there. On a recent expedition, Holeman and Carpenter found another skeleton. Nearby, in the dust, was a set of women's synthetic hair extensions.

	It's a Monday night and Gracie Abrams is flipping through a red leather journal filled with songs. She's in her childhood bedroom, complete with a rocketship-patterned bedspread and a copy of Lizzy McAlpine's Older on display. But she's not at home; the bedroom is a replica. Abrams is actually sitting dead-center at New York's Madison Square Garden during the first of two sold-out shows. “This is beyond every single dream I've ever had, I can't even tell you,” Abrams tells the crowd.


	It's the understatement of the year. The bedroom Abrams has replicated is the same one where, as an upstart singer-songwriter five years ago, she first performed her 2020 Minor EP during pandemic-era shows she livestreamed over Zoom. With each earnest lyric and low-key performance since, Abrams gradually captured the hearts of Gen Z women around the world. By the time she released her 2023 debut album, Good Riddance, the star had already nabbed opening-act slots for Olivia Rodrigo and Taylor Swift.

	











	“It feels like the most ridiculous master class known to man,” Abrams told Rolling Stone before opening for Swift's Eras Tour. “I'm going to learn so much keeping my head down and listening and watching her do what she was put here to do.” And that she did. The Eras Tour saw Abrams transform from a breathy, understated vocalist into an acoustic-guitar-wielding goddess with a slew of emotion-packed songs. Since then, the singer-songwriter released her breakout album, The Secret of Us, and its even more successful deluxe version. Last year, Abrams embarked on her largest headlining tour yet, selling out three nights at New York's Radio City Music Hall. Now, for her current tour, Abrams has leveled up to sold-out arenas.

	From the moment she took the stage wearing a sparkling, lime-green low-waist skirt and matching halter top, the singer couldn't hide her glee at playing MSG. She kept smirking, even as she delivered lines like “I feel like I could die” (from “Risk”) and concurrently strummed an acoustic guitar.

	Abrams swapped out her acoustic guitar for an electric semi-hollowbody Gibson throughout the night, and sometimes even abandoned the instrument altogether as she paced on a raised runway behind the stage. But the main thing you have to know about a Gracie Abrams concert is there are no wardrobe changes, outsized production sets, or buttoned-up choreography. 


	Instead, there are hundreds of bow-wearing fans willing to push the limits of their vocal chords as they scream each lyric like their life depends on it. I'm not talking about just for the set list closers, either. There was full-blown yelling for Every. Single. Song. (At one point, girls in the row behind me complained about losing their voices before Abrams could even whip out her most popular tunes.)


	This isn't just for the hell of it, either. From the third song into the show, “21,” it was clear these heart-torn melodies hold special connections for each fan. On “21,” fans squealed “sorry” in unison as Abrams reached high into her register. But the singer's efforts were futile; the fans' screams were so loud, they drowned her out.


	Nowhere was the deep-rooted fan connection with Abrams' brutally honest catalog more apparent than on “Let It Happen,” a Swiftian track with an explosive bridge. When it got to that point in the song, the singer urged the already-wailing fans: “I want to hear this bridge, all right?” They obeyed her like good pupils and didn't fumble a single lyric. Fans even knew every word to the unreleased synth-pop track “Out of Nowhere,” which Abrams debuted at her Glastonbury set just last month.


	In response to the roaring fans, the singer made sure to put them front and center. She walked through the crowd to two separate smaller stages on the floor, stopping to say hi to everyone she could along the way. While singing “Tough Love,” Abrams spotted a fan's poster that read “Write out ‘Let It Happen.'” Without missing a beat, Abrams took a Sharpie and scribbled several different options for the song title.

	Just before launching into TSOU Deluxe track “Cool,” Abrams asked, “This is a safe space to say it … is anyone in a situationship of sorts?” Not only did the audience respond emphatically, they sang about love interests not calling back with a palpable anger.

	











	Beyond the cathartic sing-alongs that made the massive venue feel intimate, one of the highlights of the night was Role Model's surprise duet for “Mess It Up.” The opening act, whose real name is Tucker Pillsbury, performed the deep cut to a crowd that somehow managed to raise its decibel level higher than when he took the stage earlier that night. (It was the most excited I'd ever seen a Garden crowd for an opener.) For his solo set, Pillsbury turned the charm offensive all the way up, shimmying his hips as he sang twangy love songs. The highlight, of course, was his celebrity guest for crowd-favorite “Sally, When the Wine Runs Out,” which was none other than Natalie Portman.


	While Abrams' viral TikTok hits like “That's So True” and “Close to You” got their massive, end-of-the-night moments, they weren't even the biggest of the evening. Sure it was a treat to hear several audience members try to conjure a surprise Taylor Swift appearance with their whispers. (The superstar is featured on fan-favorite track “Us”). Sure, the crowd jumped so hard, I swear the Garden shook as confetti rained down during the final song.


	But it was the moment on the tiny C stage, tucked at the very edge of the MSG floor, where Abrams shined the brightest on Monday night. As the singer delivered lyrics about reflecting on her success, video clips of fans from her past shows played on the screen. “I feel like myself right now,” Abrams sang, and the line hit so hard, several fans had tears streaming down their faces. After all, these devoted attendees know better than anyone that the singer-songwriter has trekked through New York clubs for the past four years, growing her audience with each performance.


	“Sept. 22, 2021, was the first show we ever played in New York, and it was at Mercury Lounge,” Abrams said. “Now, because of you, we get to be here for two sold-out nights. I just want you to know that all of us were backstage pinching ourselves and each other. You've done this for us. You're the whole point, you're the reason.”

	Long before HBO turned Sunday night into TV-monoculture ground zero, there was Ed Sullivan. Born in Harlem and raised in Port Chester, New York, the sportswriter, syndicated columnist and radio-program personality was tapped by CBS to host a weekly variety show for the television network. The master of ceremonies had a few ideas about what he wanted to do. For starters, there were a handful of old-timey vaudeville acts that, by 1948, had no place left to perform. Sullivan felt they deserved a home, and this new medium would provide it. He believed that viewers across America deserved to experience the finest — and the most eccentric — culture that New York City had to offer, all from the comfort of their living rooms. And he wanted to showcase a lot of music. Specifically, Black music.


	Everyone knows the stories about the respective Ed Sullivan Show appearances of Elvis and the Beatles, and how his immensely popular Sunday night program inspired several generations to pick up guitars, grow their hair long, and play rock & roll. What's less talked about is the way that Sullivan's “rilly big sheew” gave Mahalia Jackson, Harry Belafonte, James Brown, the Jackson 5, “Little” Stevie Wonder, Nina Simone, Diana Ross, Bo Diddley, Tina Turner, Nat King Cole, Gladys Knight & the Pips, Jackie Wilson and dozens of other Black artists a chance to speak to a national audience, notably at a moment when some parts of America wanted to isolate them or silence them altogether. And this is where Sunday's Best comes in. Quietly slipped onto Netflix last week without much fanfare or promotion, Sacha Jenkins' invaluable documentary reappraises Sullivan's legacy not as a TV pioneer — that's always been set in stone — but as a show-don't-tell social activist. You go in thinking of the stiff, easily imitable Sullivan as simply a boomer boob-tube icon. By the end credits, you recognize that he was a low-key resistance fighter for civil rights and racial equality, who used his power to televise a social revolution one musical act at a time.

	Even if you check this doc out just for the sheer talent on display, you'll get your money's worth. Billy Preston rips into “Agent Double-O-Soul” as Ray Charles backs him on piano. Cole and fellow crooner Tony Martin turn their “The Sunny Side of the Street” duet into a one-act play. The Ike & Tina Turner Revue make extremely good on the title of “Bold Soul Sister.” Diddley demonstrates how his signature syncopated rhythm essentially gave early rock & roll a blueprint. Several James Brown sets offer testimonials that the man from Georgia was indeed the hardest working man in show business. And Sullivan introduces a 12-year-old named Toni Harper who takes families, huddled in front of their TVs across the United States, to church with one of the most stirring renditions of “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot” ever aired.

	











	Most of these clips have been available for a while (the above playlist comes courtesy of the official Ed Sullivan Show‘s YouTube channel; they've been diligently posting nuggets from the archives for 15 years now). Jenkins' documentary puts all of them in much-needed context, in order to make the case that, despite the constant threat of censorship and the network's hand-wringing over alienating the Southern market, Sullivan bucked the system and stood by the acts he wanted to give the spotlight to. Sunday's Best credits this partially to his Irish roots, which gave him a front-row seat to how “non-Americans” (read: immigrant populations) were maligned, abused and mistreated. Belafonte recorded several interviews with the filmmaker before his passing in 2023, and recounts being blacklisted by CBS for his politics. Sullivan asked for an audience with the singer, and said that he was told Belafonte was engaging in anti-American activities and thus, per network brass, was forbidden from appearing on his program. Belafonte mentioned Ireland taking on British oppressors in the early 1900s. How was this different from Black Americans fighting for basic human rights in the USA? Sullivan had him on the show that same week.

	And it repeatedly underlines that his strong sense of Sullivan calling out injustice when he saw it, regardless of potential clapbacks from the powers that be, was well-honed before he stepped in front of a TV camera. It singles out a 1929 football game between New York University and the University of Georgia, in which the former benched Black quarterback Dave Myers because the latter “asked that the color line be drawn.” Sullivan was a sports editor at the time, and wrote a column blasting NYU for caving to pressure from their Southern counterparts. Later, when Sullivan was starting up his show and in need of talent, he called upon jazz musicians, vocalists, dancers and entertainers like Bill “Bojangles” Robinson and Sammy Davis Jr. to appear, even though the budget prevented him from paying them much. Because he had supported them when it was still unpopular to do so outside of certain circles, they supported him. What might have began as a quid pro quo situation continued long after The Ed Sullivan Show became the must-see TV of its day.

	Not even key sponsors pulling ads stopped him from booking Black performers, from treating them with the dignity and respect they deserved, and from displaying his friendship with them onscreen — even if some viewers below the Mason-Dixon thought Sullivan holding Diahann Caroll's hand was the equivalent of a mortal sin. Sunday's Best plays fast and loose with chronology, skipping between eras and musical genres and landmark historical moments seemingly at will. It's all in the name of presenting Sullivan's insistence on supporting Black artists and subversively selling a movement by bringing these artists who spoke, directly and indirectly, for the cause. The guy with the really big show wasn't 100-percent perfect when it came to protecting talent from network censors — just ask the guy who wrote “Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues.” But he understood that humanity and diversity were one and the same, and the man that Flip Wilson dubbed “the most important finger-pointer in show business” knew the importance of who, when and why he had to point his finger at those who benefited from it in more ways than one.

	President Donald Trump continued his Profit-Off-The-Presidency World Tour this week with a stop in Scotland, where he opened a new private golf course. You, dear taxpayer, footed the bill for most of the trip.


	On Monday, Trump cut the ribbon at the Trump International Golf Links Aberdeen, which will officially open to the paying public on August 13. The president was accompanied by his sons, Eric and Don Jr., who have taken the helm of their fathers real estate, licensing, and growing cryptocurrency empire while he occupies the White House. Trump wielded a pair of golden scissors and hit the inaugural tee for the course, all set to a backing chorus of bag pipes. 


	“We have a world that's had some conflict, but we've ironed out a lot of it,” Trump told those gathered to witness the grand opening, as Russia's war against Ukraine still rages and Israel continues to kill Palestinians in Gaza. “We're going to have a great and peaceful world. And on a much smaller scale, this will be a tremendously successful place, a place where people can come and enjoy life.”

	











	Trump was reportedly asked on Air Force One about promoting his own businesses while on an official trip in Scotland. “I haven't heard that,” he said. “Did you get to see my drive on the first hole? Pretty long. That's not Joe Biden.”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The inauguration of the golf course took place on the second-to-last day of Trump's formal state visit to Scotland, where he met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The trip came as the president continues to fend off questions about his relationship with convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, and faces increased pressure to respond to famine conditions in Gaza. On Saturday, during a round of golf at his other Scottish golf course, Trump Turnberry, the president ducked a question about Epstein before speeding off in a caravan of golf carts while blasting “Memories,” from the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Cats.

	According to an analysis by Huffpost, Trump's five-day trip to Scotland cost taxpayers around $10 million in travel, security, logistics, and lodging. While his visit with state leaders is the official reason for the expense, the visit is another blatant instance of the president dipping his hands into public coffers in order to forward his and his family's private business ventures. The White House is helping him do it, sharing videos of the ribbon cutting ceremony on their official social media accounts, and using clips from Trump's remarks at the event to bash the “fake news.” 


	Trump and the government's promotion of the president's private golf resort is yet another example of the historic levels of corruption and lawlessness that are undergirding the authoritarian streak of Trump's second stint in the White House. It also further demonstrates how far he's come from the somehow not-as-bad, not-as-open corruption of his first presidency. As Rolling Stone reported in May, according to those close to Trump, the president has gossiped to confidants that it was “stupid” of him to leave so much money on the table during his first administration and that only a fool would make the same mistake during his second.


	Trump is aggressively following through on that vow, in ways that suggest he's not even attempting to veil his corrupt self-interest from the American public anymore.


	During his first term, he'd at least lie about it from time to time.


	In late 2019, the first Trump administration brought upon themselves yet another public-relations headache when Vice President Mike Pence decided to book a room at Trump's golf resort and hotel near Doonbeg, Ireland, during the vice president's official visit to the nation.

	When the administration took very predictable heat for shoveling more public money into Trump's own pocket, the president told the media that he had “no involvement” with the hotel booking and that “people like my product, what can I tell you.”


	It was a lie. According to three sources with knowledge of the matter, prior to Pence's Ireland trip, Trump personally spoke to Pence and directly pressured his vice president to book his stay at the Trump-owned resort. When the president was told it might look bad, Trump replied it would look “worse” if Pence stayed elsewhere when Trump's hotel was right there. (Naturally, when the public backlash ensued, he threw Pence under the bus.)

	











	Trump, the sources add, would insist during his first administration that he and other senior government personnel routinely patronize different international Trump family properties, telling officials that if they didn't, people might think there's something wrong with the hotels or golf courses.

#1 FOR NEW COUNTRY

The Evansville area seems to have some active skies!

The term UFO stands for Unidentified Flying Object, and is essentially an object you see in the sky, but can't make out what it is.

 

Britannica explains UFOs as:

The history of UFO sightings is actually quite fascinating, and Britannica notes the first widely publicised UFO sighting took place in 1947, so this isn't a new phenomenon.





travelng north on rt 57,I noticed dust being kicked up in a farmers field,i looked up and noticed that at about 200 feet in the air a silvery disk shaped object was traveling parallel to the ground traveling at about the same speed as me and a friend.this object was approx 1/4 mile away and it was a sunny warm spring day,the object was very detailed and i could see what appeared to be windows on the top portion of the craft.i have never seen anything like this before and have never seen anything like it since,and was totally unmistakeable for anything other than a classic disk shaped ufo

I would also like to note that this took place on 4/20, so make of that what you will. It may mean nothing, but I just felt it may be worth pointing out.

Demi Moore is one of the biggest stars in Hollywood, especially now after her comeback that led to an Oscar nomination with her outstanding performance in The Substance.

But the siren's image was not always so slick.

The St Elmo's Fire actress was born with a very different name that did not quite have a ring to it: Demi Gene Guynes.

Her last name changed to Moore after marrying musician Freddy Moore in 1979.

And the Landman actress grew up far from the klieg lights of the movie industry: her hometown is Roswell, New Mexico, a city in the southeastern part of the state, known primarily for the alleged 1947 UFO incident.

Earlier this year Demi told fans how to say her first name properly: Moore confirmed that she pronounces her name as 'Duh-mee' because it 'works better' with her last name. 

Demi Moore is one of the biggest stars in Hollywood, especially now after her comeback that led to an Oscar nomination with her turn in The Substance. But her image was not always so slick; seen in April in NYC

The Substance actress was born with a very different name that did not quite have a ring to it: Demi Gene Guynes. Her last name changed to Moore after marrying musician Freddy Moore in 1979. And the Landman actress grew up in Roswell, New Mexico

Her name has an interesting background.

Her biological father, Air Force airman Charles Foster Harmon Sr., left her mother, who was only 18-years-old at the time, before Demi's birth. 

When Moore was three months old, her mother married Dan Guynes, a newspaper advertising salesman who often switched up his jobs; as a result, the family moved many times.

Moore learned that Guynes was not her real father at age 13, when she discovered a marriage certificate and inquired about the circumstances since she 'saw my parents were married in February 1963. I was born in '62.'

Moore said in 1991, 'My dad is Dan Guynes. He raised me. There is a man who would be considered my biological father who I don't really have a relationship with.' 

Her biological father Harmon died in 1997 from liver cancer in Texas.

Demi and her mother shared plenty of drama: they became estranged in 1989, but reconciled shortly before Guynes death in 1998.

When Demi was 14 she and her mom moved to West Hollywood, where she started modeling and taking acting classes.

In 1979, three months before her 17th birthday, Moore wed Moore, and they divorced in 1985. That is how she became Demi Moore.

Her first blockbuster was Ghost in 1990 with Patrick Swayze and Whoopi Goldberg

Her career took off at a young age.

Her first film was Choices (1981), then Parasite (1982), and next she was in the soap opera General Hospital. Following that came her famous Brat Pack phase. 

Moore recently said she felt 'a little terrified' when she was cast in General Hospital.

The actress joined the cast of the hit soap opera in 1981, and the role proved to be a real turning point in her career.

The Hollywood star told People: 'I think the first big moment that kind of gave me a little bit of encouragement of, wow, this could be possible, is when I got 'General Hospital' because it was a real job on a show that was successful for a soap opera.

'In fact, it was at a heightened state because Elizabeth Taylor had just been a guest on a soap opera.'

Demi quickly became convinced that she had a long-term future in the entertainment industry.

Demi - who became the world's highest-paid actress in the 90s - recalled: 'Literally, it was a month before my 19th birthday. And so it was like a real job where I was going to be paid and have an actual salary. Meaning that I didn't have to have another job. I could actually live by doing this thing that I loved and hoped I could do. So that was like the first moment to really kick it off.'

Her latest hit show is Landman; seen with Jacob Lofland, Ali Larter, Billy Bob Thornton and Andy Garcia from Landman

Moore has retained her movie star looks and slim figure

Despite this, Demi still felt anxious about joining the cast of the hit TV show.

Looking at a photo from a publicity shoot for General Hospital, Demi said: 'I got General Hospital a month before my 19th birthday, so I think I'm 19 years old. Super dolled up, heavy duty made up.

'You know, I just was so excited for all of it. But if I'm looking at this photo, I think I was probably a little terrified also.'

In December, Demi revealed that she feels more 'liberated' than ever in her career.

The actress has been working in Hollywood for decades, and Demi has now reached a place of 'radical acceptance' in her life.

The movie star - who was married to Bruce Willis between 1987 and 2000 - told 'Extra': 'I think it's the most liberated that I feel. The place is of greater, or I would say, of radical acceptance.'

Recently, upon mentioning to a friend that my upcoming novel had supernatural elements, he quipped: What is it with you and the paranormal? Good question! It's true that I'm fascinated by the possibility of life beyond the veil, and by the limits of our current human knowledge. And I like to use these elements in my mystery novels to ratchet up the stakes, because of the element of not knowing.

We've all experienced it. I'm not talking the spectral visions from Disneyland's Haunted House (though that ride was an early influence on me, not gonna lie). But rather the spooky feeling of shivers going up one's back with no apparent cause. The uncanny sensation that the eyes of a painted image are following you around the room. The eerie feeling of waking in the middle of the night and wondering whether that unnerving thump was real, or part of a dream.

Merriam-Webster defines paranormal as something that stands outside the normal, or that which is not scientifically explainable. The not knowingness of the supernatural can enhance tension and put readers on edge, whether the novel is explicitly paranormal, or employs subtle inferences to something otherworldly, or simply hints at things that are beyond our ken.

The following are a few guidelines I use when incorporating the supernatural in my mystery novels, whether the story is cozy or gritty or noir:

Ya Gotta Have Rules

Keep your world-building internally consistent.

Rule number one for incorporating supernatural elements in a novel: The fictional world has to make sense. If there are spirits, are those ethereal beings able to show themselves at will? Are they always evil? Are the motivations the same on the other side of the veil?

If a character is psychic, can she see and feel all, at any time, or is she bound by the limits of her skills and energies, or by something else? If you're introducing mythical creatures, how much agency do they have to interact with—to threaten or to help—the other characters in the novel?

No matter what, begin by grounding your world in the magical. The supernatural is not a coat of paint applied atop the secular and scientific human realm.

Rather, it should be integral to the novel's framework: The main character(s) may or may not believe in the paranormal as the story begins, but the author must never lose sight of those supernatural laws and how they apply to the tale being told—and contribute to the mystery you are solving.

Don't Show the Shark! 

Steven Spielberg was considered a genius for not showing the dreaded shark in the movie Jaws, and instead allowing the audience's imaginations to run amok with horrifying images. His decision was due more to technical difficulties than an artistic choice, but the point is that the human imagination—informed as it is by personal history and idiosyncratic quirks—tends to create much more vivid (and awful) images than what can be conjured on film.

Similarly, avoid the temptation to over-explain the supernatural elements. Keeping the reader in suspense, letting them wonder not only “what will happen” but “is it even real?” helps to build tension, support pacing, and enhance the mystery.

Recently I reread Stephen King's classic ghost story, The Shining, and was surprised to realize that the actual ghosts appear rarely in the book. King instead creates a mounting sense of dread, based primarily on the horrifying setup of a mother and child snowbound and trapped with an unreliable and potentially violent man.

Just as with oversharing a character's backstory early on, refrain from showing too much of the paranormal world on the page too soon. Instead, give your readers the opportunity to envision for themselves the worst. Manipulate emotions. Subvert expectations. Lean in to the not knowing.

Exploit the Horror of Real Life

It is a sad reality that much of human history, and everyday human behavior, is disturbing. Use that. Anchor your paranormal story in reality.

There is a reason people are so ready to believe that abandoned prisons, asylums for the mentally ill, poor farms, and orphanages might be haunted. How can so much suffering not have had an impact on the physical world such that the negative energy is absorbed by material objects and passed down through the ages? How might the residue of those fraught emotions and violent actions develop over the years—and how they might manifest in the present?

This is key to your storytelling.

The supernatural aspects of your story might also reflect troubling current events, the way Jordan Peele uses pervasive racism as a horror element in his film, Get Out. Or how Mary Shelley famously exploited suspicions about early science and technology in her archetypal account of Frankenstein's terrifying monster.

Other real-world afflictions such as sleep paralysis, psychosis, memory loss, poisoning, and carbon monoxide overexposure can also lead to everyday people “experiencing” hauntings, vision, or demons. Such examples can be used to keep the reader wondering what is real and what is not.

And remember: Scary does not necessarily equal evil. Facing our fears may lead to healing and redemption. The reader is here for it; let your characters be, as well.

In Sum…

It is human nature to want to explore the fringes, to push the limits. As any caretaker of small children can attest, we humans are hard-wired to take risks. As we mature, quelled as we are by experience and the limits of the human body, most of us mellow.

But that does not mean we're any less fascinated with pushing boundaries and exploring the unknowable, the unexplainable, and the unthinkable. We just explore it by different means.

In his seminal work, The Golden Bough, the anthropologist James George Frazer argued that all human belief systems are rooted in the attempt to interpret and to make sense of the world, not the least of which is “the fear of the human dead.” Not to mention the way those humans got dead.

One of the reasons we mystery writers are fascinated with murder is that it is the definitive crime, the ultimate disorder. A world grounded in an enhanced reality—a paranormal reality—permits the author to ratchet up the suspense around, and explore the implications of, a very human crime…and of the not knowing.

Cosmic rays may be sufficient to nourish life residing underground on planets and moons within our solar system, according to new research from NYU Abu Dhabi that broadens the search for extraterrestrial life beyond the traditional “Goldilocks Zone.”

High-energy ionizing radiation from cosmic rays is typically harmful to life and can cause DNA damage. However, here on Earth, we are shielded from most of these rays by our planet's atmosphere. The new research paints a different picture—one in which cosmic rays may not only be harmless in certain environments but could actually support life.

The research was led by Dimitra Atri of the NYU Abu Dhabi Center for Astrophysics and Space Science's (CASS) Space Exploration Laboratory. Challenging the traditional view that sunlight or volcanic heat are necessary for life, Atri's team investigated what might happen when cosmic rays encounter underground liquid water or water ice.

Their findings revealed that cosmic rays can break down water molecules, releasing electrons. In a process reminiscent of photosynthesis, certain Earth-based bacteria have been observed consuming these electrons as an energy source through a mechanism known as radiolysis. Even in dark, cold environments completely devoid of sunlight, radiolysis has enabled bacteria to survive beneath Earth's surface—and it may do the same elsewhere in the solar system.

Building on this knowledge, Atri's team conducted simulations to estimate the energy potential of cosmic-ray interactions on several planetary bodies. The researchers focused on Mars, Saturn's moon Enceladus, and Jupiter's moon Europa—each of which is thought to harbor subsurface water and is considered a potential candidate for extraterrestrial life. The results suggested that Enceladus offered the most favorable conditions for radiolysis-supported life, followed by Mars, with Europa ranking third.

“This discovery changes the way we think about where life might exist,” said Atri. “Instead of looking only for warm planets with sunlight, we can now consider places that are cold and dark, as long as they have some water beneath the surface and are exposed to cosmic rays. Life might be able to survive in more places than we ever imagined.”

Astrobiologists have long focused on the “Goldilocks Zone,” the region around a star where a planet is neither too hot nor too cold to support liquid water on its surface. Atri's team now proposes a broader concept: the Radiolytic Habitable Zone. This includes areas where cosmic rays could interact with underground water, potentially providing a source of energy for microbial life via radiolysis.

Applying the Radiolytic Habitable Zone concept may prompt future space missions to rethink their approach. Rather than focusing solely on surface conditions, scientists may begin to prioritize tools capable of detecting chemical energy generated by radiation below the surface. This could yield a new set of promising targets in the ongoing search for life—even right here in our solar neighborhood.

The paper, “Estimating the Potential of Ionizing Radiation-induced Radiolysis for Microbial Metabolism on Terrestrial Planets and Satellites with Rarefied Atmospheres,” appeared on July 28, 2025, in the International Journal of Astrobiology.

This is key to your storytelling.

The supernatural aspects of your story might also reflect troubling current events, the way Jordan Peele uses pervasive racism as a horror element in his film, Get Out. Or how Mary Shelley famously exploited suspicions about early science and technology in her archetypal account of Frankenstein's terrifying monster.

Other real-world afflictions such as sleep paralysis, psychosis, memory loss, poisoning, and carbon monoxide overexposure can also lead to everyday people “experiencing” hauntings, vision, or demons. Such examples can be used to keep the reader wondering what is real and what is not.

And remember: Scary does not necessarily equal evil. Facing our fears may lead to healing and redemption. The reader is here for it; let your characters be, as well.

In Sum…

It is human nature to want to explore the fringes, to push the limits. As any caretaker of small children can attest, we humans are hard-wired to take risks. As we mature, quelled as we are by experience and the limits of the human body, most of us mellow.

But that does not mean we're any less fascinated with pushing boundaries and exploring the unknowable, the unexplainable, and the unthinkable. We just explore it by different means.

In his seminal work, The Golden Bough, the anthropologist James George Frazer argued that all human belief systems are rooted in the attempt to interpret and to make sense of the world, not the least of which is “the fear of the human dead.” Not to mention the way those humans got dead.

One of the reasons we mystery writers are fascinated with murder is that it is the definitive crime, the ultimate disorder. A world grounded in an enhanced reality—a paranormal reality—permits the author to ratchet up the suspense around, and explore the implications of, a very human crime…and of the not knowing.

Posted By Joelle Daniels | On 29th, Jul. 2025



Silent Hill f is undoubtedly slated to be Konami's big return to the survival horror genre after the success of the Silent Hill 2 remake last year. In a recent interview, writer Ryukishi07—known for his work on seminal horror story Higurashi When They Cry—has described the supernatural and psychological elements of Silent Hill f as being “salad dressing”. At a panel alongside producer Motoi Okamoto and composer and sound designer Akira Yamaoka, Ryukishi07, according to Famitsu (via Automaton), said that players will have trouble in telling the difference between the psychological and supernatural horror motifs of the game.

This, he noted, comes down to the fact that he used a different method of writing than what he usually does. Rather than having several different kinds of themes in the game's story, Ryukishi07 instead focused on a central theme around which the entire story would then be written. Expanding on his “salad dressing” metaphor, he explained that supernatural and psychological elements would act like distinct ingredients of a salad dressing – like oil and vinegar. While he didn't go into too many details about what this might mean, his explanation indicated that players might end up having a hard time distinguishing between the supernatural elements of the game from the various kinds of psychological terror that is likely also lurking behind dark corners.

For some context, while many Silent Hill games have featured supernatural elements, like the presence of cults and evil deities in Silent Hill 1 and 3, Silent Hill 2, on the other hand, focused purely on psychological horror. Many of the terrors faced by protagonist James Sutherland in Silent Hill 2 were essentially the town of Silent Hill forcing him to come to terms with his own trauma; even the enemies of the game were designed based on his own psychoses. Ryukishi07's “salad dressing” metaphor might indicate that the game's story will blend both of these styles of horror together to create even more uncertainty within players' minds.

Back in June, Ryukishi07 had said that the central themes of the game will be things that the franchise has never tackled before. At the same event, NeoBards senior producer Albert Lee, along with series producer at Konami, Motoi Okamura, spoke about how there was a lot of time spent in coming up with ideas to bring the game's setting of Showa Era town Ebisugaoka to life. The decision to set the town in 1960s Japan was also part of this back-and-forth, because the studio wanted to present players with an environment that would feel “familiar yet alien”.

Earlier this month, Konami had revealed the opening of Silent Hill f to attendees of Anime Expo 2025. The opening video, which was captured by those in attendance, showcased protagonist Hinako speaking to a doll. Her sister was also present in the opening, dressed in a yukata. Quite a few things about the opening felt mysterious, however, including the fact that the sister's face was never shown.

Silent Hill f is coming to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S on September 25. Those who pick up the Digital Deluxe Edition will be able to play the games three days before its release.

Mama June Shannon is in the hospital just shortly after a psychic warned her about future health troubles.

On the July 25 episode of Mama June: Family Crisis, the 45-year-old met with a psychic with daughter Jessica Shannon and husband Justin Stroud for Jessica's bachelorette party. During the session, the psychic told June that she's ""lost a lot of her health” and is carrying a lot of stress, which isn't good. The psychic added that she ""may have a heart attack"" because of it.

Justin suggests taking June to the hospital but she refuses. But as the pain continued, she said she feels like she's ""about to throw up"" and a producer agrees that they should go get medical attention.

“It is way worse than it has ever been,” June said as they got in the car to go to the emergency room.

Doctors later ""determined that ovarian cysts are causing her severe pain"" and June is now “considering her treatment options.”

Ovarian cysts are common; the Mayo Clinic states that ""many women have ovarian cysts at some time,"" and most ""present little or no discomfort and are harmless.""

Jay Daniel Thompson

What's the deal with Jeffrey Epstein's client list? And who, exactly, is implicated in the Epstein files? These are the questions that have been the subject of feverish speculation ever since Elon Musk alleged that his erstwhile wingman Donald Trump is “in the Epstein files”. The Department of Justice has denied that any such list exists, and Trump denies that he was ever told that his name appears in the files.

These denials have only fuelled the furore surrounding the files and deepened the suspicion concerning their contents. Even some of Trump's own supporters are dissatisfied with his administration's handling of the whole affair.

Perhaps Trump's penchant for turning conspiracy theories into political weapons has exploded in his face. Perhaps. But conspiracy theories are about a lot more than their political effectiveness. And the shadowy existence of the “Epstein client list” is revealing in the way it highlights the various functions of conspiracy theories.

Epstein's “client list” is a document rumoured to have been maintained by the disgraced financier, which kept track of his network of wealthy and influential acquaintances — as well as, perhaps, his fellow sexual predators. It is well known and well documented that Epstein rubbed shoulders with many high-profile men, including current president Donald Trump and former president Bill Clinton, prior to his arrests in 2006 and 2019 and his subsequent death in prison.

During his 2024 election campaign, Trump indicated that he was willing to declassify “the Epstein files” — which are thought to contain “contacts, communications … flight logs” and, of course, the infamous client list. This was music to his supporters' ears. As Jackson Katz writes:

According to standard doctrine in parts of the right-wing populist MAGAverse, those nefarious elites — especially liberals and Democrats — not only looked down on average Americans, but thought they could get away with all manner of immorality and depravity — up to and including the sexual exploitation of children. 

Stopping them and returning the government to “the people” was a job for a larger-than-life figure, a mythic hero. It was a role that Donald Trump, with his insatiable need for attention and entertainer's instinct for giving the audience what they want, was more than happy to play.

Following Musk's parting shot in June, however, Trump has been doubling down on denials and attacking those people who “want to talk about … the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax”. He's urged his supporters not to “waste Time and Energy” on it — and if these “weaklings” can't find it within themselves to move on, he said “I don't want their support anymore!”

But his formerly loyal followers aren't falling into line the way Trump hoped. As Charlie Kirk, the prominent conservative political activist and president of Turning Point USA, recently declared: “I think every file should be released to the public the same way as the JFK files. Let the American people decide.”

On top of that, it has been reported in both the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times that Trump appears repeatedly in the files — and that the US President was told as much by Attorney General Pam Bondi in May of this year. This reporting has served to reinforce the previous testimony of women as to the closeness of Epstein and Trump, and one woman accused Trump of groping her during a visit to Trump Towers in Epstein's presence around 1993.

When you combine these three elements — Trump's decade-long friendship with Epstein, Trump's unwillingness to honour his campaign pledge to release the Epstein files, and the credible reporting that the president's name is in the files — you have all the makings of a cover-up, and a conspiracy. It's no wonder so many people are now wondering, what is Trump concealing?

That question is extremely important, of course. Here, however, I want to think through what the Epstein files episode suggests about conspiracy itself.

The term “conspiracy” encompasses narratives alleging that powerful actors — such as politicians, aristocrats, oligarchs and celebrities — have nefarious plans that affect the broader public, but about which the public is being kept in the dark. A conspiracy theorist, in turn, is someone who claims to see what's really going on and takes upon themselves the responsibility of alerting the masses. Part of the attraction of conspiratorial narratives is their ability to make sense complex, disturbing phenomena and provide clear-cut answers. As a 2023 study puts it:

believing in conspiracy theories can possibly increase the sense of coherence, to the extent that they help their followers make sense of the complexity of the world by providing them with simple, overarching narratives in which most events can be integrated. Indeed, past research has shown that presenting participants with information ordered in an identifiable pattern increased the feeling of coherence, and thereby feelings of meaning in life.

The Epstein affair has all the ingredients of a classic conspiracy: there are the shady millionaires responsible for egregious abuses of power (some of which have been proven, others remain rumours); there are the concealed documents that may contain sordid facts; and there is the mystery surrounding Epstein's own purported suicide in prison. The question is how to combine the elements to achieve the desired coherence. Is Donald Trump implicated in the Epstein files — in which case, he would belong to the shadowy elite who have gotten away with prodigious abuses of power — or is Trump the victim of someone else's plot (say, a Democratic effort to topple his presidency, as Trump likes to claim)?

This points to several features of conspiracy theories that reveal a great deal about how they function and why they spread.

First, conspiracies almost always contain kernels of truth. In this case, Jeffrey Epstein was accused of horrific crimes and there is significant documentary evidence of his guilt. He has also been photographed and filmed many times in the presence of Donald Trump. And 27 women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct. But, of course, none of this means that Epstein maintained a list of A-list abusers, much less that the name of the current US president is on that list. These are simply the elements that have a basis in reality, which are combined in various ways to produce the particular conspiracy theory.

Second, conspiracies are self-reproducing. I like to think of them as resembling Gremlins or the eponymous terrors from Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Just when you thought that one conspiracy has been debunked, or at least has faded from view, another emerges in its place to counter the previous one and set the record straight. And on it goes. That's why trying to quash conspiracy theories is like playing a game of whack-a-mole.

Third, conspiracy can be a rhetorical tool, used to silence critics by painting them as irrational, ideologically biased and therefore unreliable. Consider, for example, Trump's description of the reports that his name appears in the Epstein files as “a continuation of the fake news stories concocted by the Democrats and the liberal media”.

Fourth, conspiracies have proliferated on the world wide web. This is partly because of the sheer speed and reach of the internet. It's also because of what Tommaso Venturini calls “online attention dynamics”: in order for content not to get lost, it needs to be picked up by algorithms, shared and re-shared on social media and, hopefully, “go viral”. I've suggested elsewhere that sensationalism — a key feature of conspiracy theories — can help achieve that viral outcome.

The question that I am left with is this: do the conspiracies currently swirling around the Epstein files help people attain a more lucid understanding of the nature of Epstein's crimes — and the powerful, wealthy men who both enabled and perversely benefited from them — or do they obscure the suffering of the victims of those crimes, thereby adding insult to already egregious injuries?

I believe the latter seems most likely.

At best, these conspiracies — alluring and lurid as they are — contribute to a disorienting cultural condition that is sometimes glossed as “post-truth”. In a post-truth world, “objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief”. In such a world, anything, no matter how outlandish or factually unverified, can potentially be true — which also means that anything can be denied. According to this post-truth logic, there can be an Epstein client list and such a list can be non-existent. Trump can be named on that list and he can be a victim of political machinations. It doesn't matter — it's all about which is personally and politically advantageous.

At worst, the Epstein conspiracies contribute to the suffering of his accusers. One such woman has remarked that the financier's alleged “victims are people with feelings that are trying to live their everyday lives”, and the media attention surrounding the conspiracies “can feel like a real weight falling on us”.

Indeed, one thing that Trump and his fellow travellers have managed to do is make this entire sordid affair about him. By focusing attention on Trump either as either a source of truth (he will be the one to release the Epstein files and expose those predatory elites) or an obfuscator of it (for whatever reason).

In so doing, Trump and his supporters have minimised the victims and their suffering. They have directed attention away from issues like misogyny, male sexual entitlement and sexualised abuses of power. They have directed attention away from the sordid networks of influence, intimidation and impunity that enabled Epstein to get away with his crimes for so long — and when he was initially held to account in 2006, to receive a paltry plea deal. Instead, it's all about Trump and what it means for his presidency.

Now, that does sound a bit conspiratorial.

A five-year study dispels the stereotype of conspiracy theorists as angry loners or keyboard warriors. Rather, social and emotional connections provided by conspiracy theorists are recruiting diverse participants on a growing scale.

The researchers, from the University of Bath's School of Management and Trinity College Dublin, followed individuals on the cusp of becoming conspiracy theorists to understand how people become involved in fringe ideas. They joined closed groups in online social networks, and attended public meetings, conferences and protests.

""We were initially apprehensive about approaching groups often depicted as delusional, dangerous and angry,"" said Dr. Tim Hill. ""In practice, when we went to events, we found people were welcoming, inquisitive, and enthusiastic. This social quality of these contexts became key to our findings.""

The researchers say they hope the study will reshape discussions of how people become involved in conspiracy theories, moving away from ideas that belief in conspiracy theory is motivated by personality or irrational thinking alone. By understanding troubling life circumstances and people's subsequent search for solutions and support, this study helps to explain how and why conspiracy theories are growing.

The research, published in the journal Sociology, took place in two stages. During the first stage of data collection (2017–2018), they were introduced to a community interested in a variety of conspiracy theories. These included anti-5G narratives, flat-Earth ideas, alternative health and vaccine hesitancy, as well as New Age spirituality.

During the second stage of data collection (2018–2022), the researchers attended various events organized by conspiracy theorists, attending public meetings, conferences and protests at locations in the South of England and South Wales.

From 32 interviews with 23 participants, they identified three main stages to believing in conspiracy theories. Firstly, an experience that leads people to question trusted sources of knowledge—in many cases this could be feeling let down by public sector services or authority figures, which leads them to feel emotionally connected to conspiracy ideas.

Secondly, people make sense of conspiracy theories together, which strengthens shared beliefs. Referred to as ""awakenings,"" people feel they are understanding the truth about the world for the first time.

Elle, a 20-year-old massage therapist who came to believe that COVID-19 was coordinated by powerful groups of 'deep state' actors said, ""My friends and me, we see the world now through a new set of eyes. The pandemic made us see the light, to see the truth. It was like a revelation.""

Dr. Hill said, ""Conspiracy theories provide reassuringly simple answers, but more than just solving problems, they create shared emotions, belonging and community.

""We went to venues that were buzzing—a campaigner opens with a story and then people stand up to share theirs. The campaigner will give their thoughts which are followed by clapping, giving a sense of solidarity and positivity that a clear, definitive answer has been identified.""

In the final stage, people not only believe in the theories but also take action based on them—to protest as part of a conspiracy movement. Often this follows on from 'doing their own research'—reading official documents and taking on board a wealth of conspiracy-related information, which enables them to produce their own conspiratorial explanations.

Co-author Professor Robin Canniford, also from Bath's School of Management, said, ""The participatory aspect of conspiracy theories encourages people to become involved. It can feel very positive and supportive. It's a thriving and welcoming social scene where people feel they are better informed about the workings of the world and are ready to take action.""

However, the social nature of conspiracy theory communities does not mean they are benevolent. One participant had become estranged from his family and received a criminal conviction following his involvement in anti-lockdown protests, demonstrating how conspiracy theories can tear apart families and lives.

Co-author Dr. Stephen Murphy, from Trinity Business School, said, ""While these groups offer a sense of belonging, it's crucial to recognize that they can equally lead to division and distress in personal relationships outside of conspiracy communities.""

MOSCOW, July 29. /TASS/. The European Union informed Ukraine on July 24 that all financial assistance has been ""put on hold"" pending the resolution to concerns over the independence of the country's anti-corruption agencies, the Ekonomicheskaya Pravda (or Economic Truth) newspaper reported, citing sources within the Ukrainian government, parliament and diplomatic circles.

The suspension primarily affects the ERA program (Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration for Ukraine) program, which was to provide 17.2 billion euro in emergency loans funded by frozen Russian assets until end of year, and the Ukraine Facility program, which was to allocate 12.5 billion euro in financial support.

The Ukrainian parliament is set to review the draft law aimed at guaranteeing the independence of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO), on Thursday, July 31. Since no aid tranches were expected in the coming days, the passage of the new law in the Verkhovna Rada could lead to a resumption of EU funding, eliminating any real consequences of the debacle for Kiev.

Vladimir Zelensky has long tried to establish control over NACB and SACPO, but they remained independent. On June 23, NACB filed corruption charges against Alexey Chernyshov, who at that time served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Unity of Ukraine. Chernyshov is considered a very influential figure in Zelensky's circle, and this has escalated the conflict. According to the opposition-minded deputies, anti-corruption authorities could soon bring charges against other persons close to Zelensky.

On July 21, the Security Service searched NACB employees, and came to SACPO with an inspection. The next day, the Rada, where the majority of deputies belong to the Zelensky-controlled party, adopted a law to eliminate the independence of NACB and SACPO. That evening, about 2,000 Kiev residents took to the streets to rally against the decision. Rallies were held in other cities. However, Zelensky signed the law, which came into force on July 23 triggering new protests.

Kiev was also criticized in the West for the decision. In this situation, Zelensky changed his position and already on July 24 submitted to parliament a bill on the so-called strengthening of the powers of anti-corruption bodies, which, in fact, reversed the previous decision to limit the independence of NACB and SACPO. At the same time, in six months, according to the draft law, the SBU will inspect the employees of these agencies.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

A gunman who killed four in a shooting spree at a Manhattan skyscraper was carrying out a revenge plot against the National Football League (NFL), a note left at the scene suggested.

Chaos engulfed Midtown Manhattan during rush hour on Monday when the gunman stormed the building, which acts as the headquarters of the NFL and hedge fund giant Blackstone, and opened fire.

The gunman, who eventually turned the weapon on himself, was identified as 27-year-old Shane Tamura from Las Vegas.

His body was found on the 33rd floor of the 44-storey building and is understood to have died from a self-inflicted injury. At least six other people were injured.

The body was found with a note that suggested he was suffering from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a brain condition linked to repeated trauma to the head.

The condition can cause mood and behavioural changes, including aggression, emotional instability, depression and increased risk of suicidal thoughts.

The three-page note reportedly suggested that Tamura's condition may have been linked to playing football in high school.

“Terry Long football gave me CTE and it caused me to drink a gallon of antifreeze,” Tamura wrote, according to CNN, in an apparent reference to the Pittsburgh Steelers player, who took his own life by drinking antifreeze in 2006, after suffering from the same condition.

“You can't go against the NFL, they'll squash you,” the note continued, “study my brain please I'm sorry Tell Rick I'm sorry for everything.”

Stills captured from a security camera show Tamura, wearing a sports coat with a buttoned shirt and armed with a large AR-15-style rifle, marching into the office block moments before firing on those inside at about 6.30pm local time (11.30pm UK).

His body was found on the 33rd floor of the 44-storey building and is understood to have died from a self-inflicted injury. At least six other people were injured.

In a statement on X, Jessica Tisch, the New York police commissioner, said the lone shooter has been “neutralised” and the scene was “contained”.

Ms Tisch added that the gunman was believed to have acted alone, and investigators had yet to determine a possible motive for the shooting, though she believed he had a “documented mental health history”.

He had recently been fired as a security guard at a casino in Las Vegas.

In the past few days, the former high school football player had driven from Las Vegas – where he was a registered gun owner – to New York, via Colorado, Nebraska, Iowa and New Jersey.

Tamura did not appear to have ever played football professionally or at college, CNN reported.

Preliminary checks of the suspect's background did not show a significant criminal history, according to CNN, citing officials.

Tamura double-parked a BMW outside the building before entering the lobby where he opened fire.

Tamura fatally shot Didarul Islam, a 36-year-old NYPD officer, then took aim at a woman who took cover behind a pillar, Ms Tisch said.

He then moved through the lobby, “spraying” it with gunfire and hitting multiple people, including a security guard who was hiding behind a desk, and another man.

The police commissioner added that Tamura then called a lift. When it arrived, a woman exited and the gunman spared her, allowing her to pass.

He went up to the 33rd floor, where Ruden Building Management is located.

Multiple 911 calls were registered at 6.28pm local time. Videos shared online showed officers in protective gear entering the building at 365 Park Avenue with their guns drawn.

Inside the building, office workers barricaded doors using sofas and other office furniture stacked floor to ceiling in an effort to prevent the shooter from entering.

The building houses the offices of Blackstone and the Consulate General of Ireland. It is located in a busy area of Midtown, located a short walk north from Grand Central Terminal and about a block east of St Patrick's Cathedral.

The skyscraper at 345 Park Avenue houses a number of other financial firms, including KPMG and Deutsche Bank.

Officer Islam, the police officer killed in the attack, was a father of two.

He was described by the city's mayor as a heroic Bangladeshi immigrant who saved lives while “putting his life on the line”.

“We lost four souls to another senseless act of gun violence, including a member of the New York City Police Department, Officer Islam,” Eric Adams, the mayor of New York, told reporters.

Mr Adams said the officer was a three-and-a-half-year veteran of the police department.

“He was saving lives, he was protecting New Yorkers,” Mr Adams said. “He loved this city, and everyone we spoke with stated he was a person of faith and a person that believed in God.”

Mr Adams said he met the officer's family on Monday night.

“I told them that he was a hero, and we admire him for putting his life on the line,” the mayor added.

Mr Islam was married, had two young sons, and his wife is pregnant with a third child.

He was working on a paid security detail in the building when the shooting occurred, the police commissioner added.

Mr Adams said the gunman was targeting the NFL specifically but entered the wrong lift and ended up in a different part of the building. 

The gunman mistakenly went to Rudin Management's offices, Mr Adams said. 

“He did have a note on him. The note alluded to that he felt he had CTE, a known brain injury for those who participate in contact sports. He appeared to have blamed the NFL for his injury,” the mayor told CBS Mornings.

It is understood that one of the victims was killed on the 33rd floor, which Tamura is said to have mistakenly entered.

Office worker Shad Sakib told AFP that he was packing his things to leave work when a public address announcement warned him and his colleagues to shelter in place.

“Everyone was confused with like, ‘Wait, what's going on?' And then someone finally realised that it's online, that someone walked in with a machine gun,” said the witness.

“He walked right into a building right next door. We saw the photo of him walking through the same area that I walked through to get lunch here.

“You would think it won't happen to you, and then it does.”

Another witness told AFP: “I was in the building. He went floor by floor.”

Some finance workers at an office building down the block were picking up dinner at a corner eatery when they heard a loud noise and saw people running.

“It was like a crowd panic,” said Anna Smith, who joined the workers pouring back into the finance office building.

They remained there for about two hours before being told they could leave.

A short time later, Ms Tisch said on X: “At this time, the scene has been contained and the lone shooter has been neutralised.”

The FBI said agents from its New York field office were also responding to provide support at the scene.

New York's senators, Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, who are both Democrats, posted on social media that they were praying for those affected by the shooting.

“We must do more to stop gun violence in America,” Mr Schumer wrote.

In a post on Truth Social, President Donald Trump said: “I have been briefed on the tragic shooting that took place in Manhattan, a place that I know and love. 

“I trust our Law Enforcement Agencies to get to the bottom of why this crazed lunatic committed such a senseless act of violence.”

“My heart is with the families of the four people who were killed, including the NYPD Officer, who made the ultimate sacrifice,” he added.

The ‘ugly-cute' elf sold by Chinese company Pop Mart has become a sensation and the authorities are aggressively cracking down on fakes – pushing production into the shadows

Trolleys piled high with decapitated silicon monster heads, tattooed dealers lurking in alleyways, bin bags of contraband hidden behind shop counters: welcome to the world of Lafufus.

Fake Labubus, also known as Lafufus, are flooding the hidden market. As demand for the collectable furry keyrings soars, entrepreneurs in the southern trading hub of Shenzhen are wasting no time sourcing imitation versions to sell to eager Labubu hunters. But the Chinese authorities, keen to protect a rare soft-power success story, are cracking down on the counterfeits.

“Labubus have become very sensitive,” says one unofficial vendor, in her small, unmarked, fake designer goods shop hidden on the 17th floor of a bland office building in Shenzhen's Huaqiangbei district, an area known for cheap electronics. “We don't dare to talk about it,” her colleague adds.

Labubus, a furry bunny-eared elf sold by Chinese toy company Pop Mart, have gone viral this year. Touted by celebrities from Rihanna to Blackpink's Lisa, the “ugly-cute” dolls have been so in demand that in the UK Pop Mart pulled the grinning monsters from all stores because of the risk of fights breaking out between customers. In the UK they retail for £17.50, while official versions in China sell for between 99 and 399 yuan (£10.30 – £41.40), with resale prices soaring much higher.

The hype has been embraced by the Chinese authorities, who have hailed Pop Mart as the latest Chinese brand to gain popularity overseas, following the likes of the viral video game Black Myth: Wukong and AI company DeepSeek.

In June, People's Daily, the Chinese Communist party's official mouthpiece, praised Labubus as representing the shift from “Made in China” to “Created in China”. “Labubu's rise fuses China's strong manufacturing base with creative innovation, tapping into the emotional needs of global consumers,” the article said.

Pop Mart's elevation to the status of national hero also appears to have motivated the authorities, in a country trying to shed its reputation for being a land of knock-offs, to aggressively crack down on fakes. In April, customs authorities in the eastern city of Ningbo intercepted a batch of 200,000 goods suspected of infringing Labubu's intellectual property, according to state media, with another sting last month catching over 2,000 fake goods.

About 40km (25 miles) across town from the Huaqiangbei store, 59-year-old Li Yang* has never heard of a “Labubu”. But she spends hours each day sitting on a low plastic stool in her high-rise apartment building slicing apart hundreds of moulded silicon monster heads that will later become Lafufus.

Surrounded by piles of flesh-coloured components, Li and her neighbour, Wang Bi*, another stay-at-home grandmother engaged in the painstaking work, spilled out into the hallway of their apartments. “Since we're staying at home, taking care of the kids, doing housework, we wanted to find some gig work,” Li says.

Li didn't know where the monster heads came from or were sent back to. The boss of a nearby factory reported by Chinese media to be producing Lafufus flatly denied any involvement, despite the presence of a pile of suspiciously Labubu-like heads piled high in the hallway.

“China has never been so determined to fix IP [intellectual property] thefts, thanks to Labubu's contribution not just as a global bestselling toy but as a soft power tool,” said Yaling Jiang, a Chinese consumer trends analyst. “Defending Labubu's IP is no longer just about business interest, but [about] national interest.”

So the Lafufu market is going underground. Authorities in Shenzhen's Huaqiangbei recently said they would be inspecting vendors for “counterfeit and shoddy” Labubus. But it doesn't take long to find a dealer.

After a quick phone call made by one of the street-side vendors hawking fake designer bags and watches, a slight, tattooed man, his canvas tote bag dripping in cutesy furry keyrings, appeared out of nowhere.

He led the Guardian into a busy shopping mall and over to a counter selling hairdryers and sunglasses. With a few furtive glances, the smartly dressed shop assistant whipped out a black plastic bag from behind the counter, full of Lafufus, for sale for 168 yuan (£17.40) each.

Fakes likely come from a range of sources. But Li's business model works like this: every few days, a courier wheels over a trolley piled with bags stuffed with hundreds of moulded monster heads to Li's apartment building. The heads are moulded by a machine, but the act of splitting them into two, so that they can be stuffed and reassembled into a finished toy, is fiddly. It requires cutting along the curved edge of the toy's head by hand, using a sharp knife.

So Li and her neighbours, all elderly women, are enlisted to slice the heads by hand, with the mystery factory paying them 0.04 yuan a piece. Every time the courier arrives, Li hauls down several large bags of split-open heads, and collects a new batch of elfin models, ready for dissection. One woman estimated she can cut through 800-1,000 heads a day, earning up to 40 yuan.

None of the workers interviewed by the Guardian had any idea what a Labubu was. Wang was shocked to hear that the finished products, fake or otherwise, sold for several hundred yuan. But one person in the home factory knew exactly what the toys were. As Li's young granddaughter wandered into the hallway to find her grandmother inspecting a finished toy, she screamed: “Labubu!”.

Air Canada on Tuesday reported profit of $186-million for the three months ending on June 30, compared with $410-million in the year-earlier periodAdrian Wyld/The Canadian Press

Air Canada AC-T saw an 11-per-cent decline in U.S-bound seat sales in the second quarter amid trade and sovereignty tensions spurred by U.S. President Donald Trump.

Canada's largest airline posted a 2-per-cent rise in overall operating revenue as travellers chose domestic or overseas destinations. 

“In the transborder market, we continue to see less demand for trips to the U.S.,” said Mark Galardo, Air Canada's chief commercial officer.

Airlines are using AI to set ticket prices. Here's how you can avoid price manipulation when booking flights

Air Canada on Tuesday reported profit of $186-million for the three months ending on June 30, compared with $410-million in the year-earlier period. Adjusted for a tax settlement, profit was $207-million, or 60 cents a share, compared with $369-million (98 cents) in the same period a year ago.

Analysts had expected adjusted profit of 72 cents a share. 

The Montreal-based carrier's results were weighed down by rising operating expenses, a weak Canadian dollar and a 16-per-cent rise in labour costs. 

Investors reacted to the results, released on Monday night, by sending Air Canada's share price down by more than 14 per cent in midday trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 

“This second quarter was not business as usual,” Mr. Galardo told analysts on an earnings conference call on Tuesday morning. “We navigated through a period of significant economic and geopolitical uncertainty and we contended with reduced demand for transborder travel.”

Other headwinds included reduced demand for travel to the Middle East and India amid geopolitical turmoil, increased competition in China and Hong Kong, and currency fluctuations, he said.

Mr. Galardo said the drop in U.S. travel was expected and accompanied by an 8-per-cent decline in seat capacity and better per-seat yields. 

Canadians have adopted an elbows-up stance against Mr. Trump's threats to make Canada the 51st state and crush its industries with tariffs. They have shunned U.S. visits and products and lauded campaigns to spend their money at home.

According to Statistics Canada, the number of Canadians crossing the border by plane has fallen through the first five months of the year, and is down in April and May by 14 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively, compared to a year ago. Trips by car, which comprise three-quarters of travel to the U.S., fell by more than 35 per cent for these months. 

‘Elbows up' vacations a boon for Canada's hospitality sector, June data show

The diminished U.S. market is significant for Canada's airlines because it was the destination for 75 per cent of all trips abroad by Canadians in 2024. 

Air Canada responded to the reduced demand by deploying its fleet to domestic and overseas destinations, adding flights to Naples, Prague and Manila.

Sales to Transatlantic and Latin American destinations rose by 5 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively, while domestic seat sales rose by 3 per cent, from a year ago. 

Mr. Galardo said Air Canada is seeing a rise in demand for off-season seats to southern Europe as travellers seek mild temperatures and smaller crowds. 

Still, Judith Coates, owner of travel agency Wired For Travel in Orillia, Ont., said she has not seen a large drop-off in demand for travel on U.S. cruise ships, which comprise most of her business there. 

“People have been asking, ‘What are other cruises we can take instead?' So, Mediterranean or Caribbean islands. That would be the only thing I have seen,” Ms. Coates said from Anchorage, Alaska. 

“What I have noticed a lot is every American that we encounter apologizes to us,” she said. “So the people in the U.S. are quite happy that they we are there and they apologize for the way they see that we are being treated.”

Not shy about travelling to the U.S.? Flight prices have dropped to some destinations

Air Canada's overall passenger revenue, which excludes cargo and other sources, rose by 1 per cent on a 2.5-per-cent increase in seat capacity. The planes, on average, were 85-per-cent full, little changed from the year-earlier period. 

“We made the right early calls to match our capacity to the evolving demand landscape,” Mr. Galardo said. 

Opinion: Domestic travel in Canada isn't as accessible as we like to think

Meanwhile, Air Canada's 10,000-plus flight attendants are voting until Aug. 5 on a strike mandate as the Canadian Union of Public Employees negotiates with management for a new collective agreement. 

A strike mandate is intended to give the union more power at the bargaining table, and does not mean a work stoppage is inevitable. 

Air Canada said the vote is part of the usual negotiating process. 

Air Canada's 5,400 pilots last year approved a contract that provides 42-per-cent raises over four years.

Heavy rains hit northern China over the weekend and intensified around Beijing on Monday. President Xi Jinping has ordered an ""all-out"" search and rescue effort.

At least 30 people have died in the outskirts of Beijing after intense rainstorms battered China's north, state media reported on Tuesday.

""The latest round of heavy rainstorms has left 30 people dead in Beijing as of midnight Monday,"" state news agency Xinhua said.

Over 80,000 people have been evacuated from the Chinese capital, according to state broadcaster CCTV.

28 deaths were reported in the hilly district of Miyun and two in Yanqing, both of which are on the outskirts of the sprawling city, far from the downtown.

Intense rainfall lashed northern China over the weekend, including in the provinces of Hebei, Jilin and Shandong. The rains intensified around Beijing on Monday.

The Huairou district in the capital's north and Fangshan in the southwest were also badly impacted.

Roads and communication infrastructure were damaged, while over 130 villages were left without power.

A landslide earlier in the day killed four in Hebei province near Beijing, state broadcaster CCTV reported, adding that eight people were still missing. 

On Monday evening, President Xi Jinping issued an order for ""all-out"" search and rescue efforts to curb casualties. 

He also called on authorities to hasten the relocation of residents in flood-threatened areas.

A frantic arms race between the US and China is underway in the Pacific while the fate of Taiwan hangs in the balance.

Washington and its allies are trying to stay ahead of Chinese capabilities, shaking Beijing off-balance as it considers whether it can launch a successful invasion of Taiwan.

At the heart of the US strategy is a new technology that has the ability to inflict devastating losses on the Chinese navy: precision strike missiles (PrSMs, pronounced “prisms”).

The missile has just been tested in Australia, where it struck a target more than 190 miles away, marking the first time the Lockheed Martin-manufactured weapon has been used by a US ally.

It can be fired with either American-made Himars or British MLRS artillery systems: missile launchers that were recently used by Ukraine to launch counter-offensives on invading Russian forces and strike deep inside enemy territory, blunting Moscow's advances.

To date, those launchers have been used with Atacms missiles, which have been in service for more than three decades with a top range of some 190 miles.

But PrSMs reportedly have a range of more than 300 miles, with the potential for this to improve in future variants. And at the recent test flight in Australia, the missile reached speeds of 4,000kmph, beating the Atacms by some 300kmph.

Each launch pod will be able to hold two of the precision missiles, compared to just a single Atacm, according to Alex Miller, the US Army's chief technology officer. It is also said to be less susceptible to jamming.

The PrSMs combine those next-generation improvements with the advantages of the Himars and MLRS systems, which are quick, agile and relatively easy to disguise – and could wreak havoc on Chinese ships attempting an invasion.

Brad Bowman, a senior director at the Foundation for Defence of Democracies, said: “It really creates a challenge for our adversaries, because where that system is now, it may not be there in 30 seconds or five minutes… That's a real detection and targeting dilemma.”

Both the US and China are ramping up their military capabilities in the Pacific and particularly around Taiwan, which Beijing regards as part of its territory even though it has effectively been independent since the 1940s.

Earlier this year, Xi Jinping, the Chinese premier, said “reunification” with China was inevitable, and that those on either side of the Taiwan Strait were “one family”.

China has regularly threatened Taiwan with fighter jet and warship incursions, but has always stopped short of a direct confrontation.

At a security conference in May, Pete Hegseth, the US defence secretary, warned that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan “could be imminent”.

The stakes couldn't be higher, for both sides.

If the US's military capabilities are outstripped by China, it would prove fatal to Taiwan, which relies on Washington to provide a credible deterrent. And if the island nation falls, it means the loss of a key strategic buffer against Beijing expansionism.

But failing to take the island would inflict a stunning blow on China, and almost certainly lead to the fall of Xi's regime.

“There's always a constant battle with both sides to try to respond to whatever advances the other side has,” said Doug Bandow, a senior fellow with the Cato Institute.

“But I'd say these [PrSMs] have the potential for dramatically increasing the risk factor for a Chinese fleet. So that's substantial.”

China's military will be only too aware of the damage Ukraine has managed to inflict on Russia using Himars since they were first provided by the US in June 2022, and will be warily eyeing the upgraded precision missiles.

Taiwan already has 11 Himars from previous arms sales with the US, and it is expected to receive more in 2026.

Mr Bandow said the PrSMs will have inflicted an important psychological blow on China without any shots even being fired, and could convince its leadership to delay its imperial ambitions.

“The most important advantage of a weapons advance like this is it simply encourages the Chinese to say, ‘No… we don't have to do it now',” he told The Telegraph.

“In my view the best chance of getting through this is to simply have that happen a lot. And hopefully we can get to a point, whatever that point is, where everyone agrees war is really stupid and this won't happen.”

Real damage could be inflicted on the Chinese fleet, both in ports and moving out to a potential invasion, if PRsMs are deployed throughout Taiwan and the rest of the first island chain, which includes Japan, Indonesia and parts of the Philippines.

Elsewhere in the Pacific, Australia signed a $310m deal with the US to join the missile programme in June.

“This is all about extending deterrence in the Indo-Pacific, all about signalling to any potential adversary that pain can be inflicted,” Pat Conroy, Australia's defence industry minister, said at the test flight this month.

But China is also moving quickly to innovate, and earlier this year appeared to be constructing D-Day style barges for an invasion that would allow it to bypass rocky or soft beaches unsuitable for tanks, providing multiple fronts for an invasion.

Some experts are concerned the US is too slow to procure PrSMs. The Pentagon's recent funding request to Congress shows the army intends to buy 44 of the missiles from Lockheed Martin.

“There's very rarely a decisive game changer by itself… but this is a key capability for the United States and our allies to have,” Mr Bowman said.

“That is the ability to sink Chinese naval vessels in large quantities from ground-based mobile platforms. That's why I think we need a whole lot of them, fast.”

			The sneering reaction to his agreement with the EU fails to capture the upsides of his approach

The deal “will bring stability. It will bring predictability”, said EU President Ursula von der Leyen at Donald Trump's Turnberry golf resort in Scotland on Sunday. “Stability” and “predictability” are not words the EU typically employs when discussing anything connected with the US president. But when you lead an economic bloc that has just been comprehensively outmanoeuvred in a trade dispute, forced into a deal that even your own side says favours the US, you could be forgiven for acting out of character.

The basic rate of 15 per cent that will now be charged on most European goods entering the US was perhaps not coincidentally the same rate that Trump had extracted from Japan in a similar deal last week. It is the same rate that could, pending an announced review, become a new general norm in US foreign trade relations. It is also substantially higher than the less than 2 per cent effective rate that the US charged the EU before Trump returned to office.

It was “the best we could get”, von der Leyen said almost apologetically in a news conference after the deal was announced. Indeed, a hard US-imposed deadline to conclude negotiations loomed on August 1, only four days after the agreement was reached. Without the deal, US tariffs on EU imports, which form about 20 per cent of the US's total foreign purchases, would have shot up to 30 per cent across the board, with high levies on automobiles, pharmaceuticals, and other key industries in which the EU has a competitive advantage left painfully in place.

In other words, Trump appears to be winning his trade war. US markets were flat on Monday, largely in anticipation of corporate earnings reports, and have risen strongly in the year to date. Wiser commentators have also come to the realisation that Trump's tariff strategy is not the economic disaster that so many of them had predicted – noting robust aggregate data and little sign that households are under pressure. The IMF's latest forecasts indicate that the US will continue to significantly outperform its developed world rivals. The president has secured commitments for considerable new investment in the US from a range of trading partners, alongside a more level playing field for American exporters.

America's discredited legacy media, however, refuses to accept that there might be any advantages to the president's approach. “Few are cheering,” said CNN of Trump's EU deal. It also felt compelled to argue that the agreement will not allow the president to escape questions about the simmering scandal around the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. For good measure, the Left-wing news network featured a human interest story claiming Trump's tariffs could “ruin” a women's golf apparel brand.

“Questions, critiques and discrepancies are hanging over the framework agreement,” declared a sceptical New York Times analysis, apparently written by seven reporters, who accused the deal of having “drawn plenty of grumbling” from critics just hours after its announcement.

On Monday, a follow-up New York Times article warned that the tariffs could inflict higher prices for Botox, Ozempic, and other cosmetic drugs. One could argue that the former paper of record, as it is often called, knows its remaining audience, but that same day it also unironically published an article observing that doctoral graduates in economics, an academic field overwhelmingly critical of Trump's tariffs, now face poor employment prospects. In fairness, on Tuesday, it did acknowledge that the slew of deals “has seemingly proved Mr Trump right that his tariff threats are a powerful bargaining tool”, but it couldn't resist casting doubt on whether they would prove an economic success.

“Much of this would have happened anyway”, sniffed the lead editorial in the Wall Street Journal of the EU's commitment to invest hundreds of billions more in the US. Pointing out that EU investment increased by about $200bn from 2023 to 2024, it joylessly observed that “those investment inflows will increase the US trade deficit because of balance-of-payments accounting”.

Perhaps some of these criticisms will be proven correct. But it is not hard to detect an unwillingness among the president's detractors to accept any upside to his approach, or to acknowledge when their own gloomy predictions have been proven disastrously wrong.

Not all observers are so down in the mouth. “The stock market is at record highs … I don't see a country in a depression … And I would have thought … that these tariffs were going to f‑--ing sink this economy by this time, and they didn't,” admitted the liberal American comedian and political commentator Bill Maher, a sometime Trump critic who has a record of giving the president credit when it is due. If the rest of the news media wants to recover ground among the 69 per cent of Americans who say they place little or no faith in it, its practitioners should recognise a good thing when they see it.

            Hot Stocks 





            The economy was supposed to crumble. The trade war was expected to escalate out of control. Markets were forecast to plunge.
    


            None of that happened – at least, not yet.
    


            President Donald Trump has pulled off what few outside the White House predicted: A trade war victory of sorts that sets America's taxes on imported goods higher than the infamous Smoot-Hawley era, without any of the damaging fallout so far. Customs revenue has increased sharply while inflation remains reasonably low. And America's trading partners, for the most part, have been willing to accept the higher tariffs without significant retaliation.
    


            Multiple framework agreements between the United States and other trading partners have jacked up tariffs on foreign goods imported to America while setting levies on US exports at or near zero. Overseas trading partners have agreed to open previously closed markets to some US goods, pledged increased investments in the United States and dropped some of what the Trump administration has lambasted as non-trade barriers, like taxes on digital services.
    


            But Trump's early trade victory may be short-lived. In fact, it is already showing signs that it may not last.
    


            The European Union, fresh off its 11th-hour compromise to get a trade agreement done before Trump's self-imposed August 1 deadline, is already in revolt.
    


            French Prime Minister François Bayrou called Sunday a “dark day.” Hungarian Prime Minister and Trump ally Viktor Orban said Trump steamrolled the EU. Belgium's Prime Minister Bart De Wever lambasted the Trump administration's “delusion of protectionism.” And Bernd Lange, chair of the European Parliament's trade committee, said the deal is “not satisfactory.”
    


            The 27-member bloc has to hammer out key aspects of its framework, and the fragile trade truce between two of the world's largest economies could quickly break apart if sentiment turns against the arrangement.
    


            The Trump administration's trade talks with its northern neighbor and one of its largest trading partners have been effectively shut down. Despite Canada relenting on its digital services tax that the president has lambasted, Trump continued to threaten higher tariffs on some Canadian goods, including lumber.
    


            Although many goods imported from Canada continue to be tariff-free because of the US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement, the USMCA only covers just about half of Canadian goods. So higher tariffs on Canada could raise some costs for American consumers down the road.
    


            And the fact that America is even embroiled in a trade spat with Canada in the first place is a sign that the recent cooling off in the trade war may not last: Trump negotiated and signed the United States' current trade agreement with Canada during his first term. At any time, even after an agreement is inked, Trump could turn around and decide to raise tariffs again.
    


            A third round of talks between China and the United States' trade negotiators is expected to result in a continued pause of their historically high tariffs on one another. But it's unclear what else might come from the discussions, and the Trump administration has grown frustrated by what it has described as China's slow-walking of its previous agreements.
    


            Both sides have aimed to reduce more regulatory barriers on shipments of key technologies. China has sought more access to critical semiconductors, and the United States wants the flow of rare earth magnets to increase further.
    


            But the Trump administration has tried repeatedly to speed up China's slow progress, claiming the country has failed to live up to its agreement to approve the critical materials for crucial electronics. Trump has also said he wants China to open up its market to more US goods – a desire that Chinese Premier Xi Jinping is unlikely to give in to significantly.
    


            Trump's rhetoric against China has cooled in recent months, but the truce appears to be on a knife's edge.
    


            A crucial appeals court hearing Thursday could determine whether most of Trump's tariffs are legal at all.
    


            For most of his tariffs, Trump has cited powers listed in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. But a federal court in May ruled that Trump overstepped his authority to levy tariffs on that basis.
    


            An appeals court paused that ruling from taking effect and will hear oral arguments Thursday. It's not clear when the court will rule, and the White House would likely appeal to the Supreme Court if it loses.
    


            If Trump ultimately loses his ability to levy tariffs using emergency powers, he has plenty of other options – but legal experts have said those alternatives could limit his ability to set tariffs without Congress. For example, Trump may be able to impose some tariffs as high as just 15% but only for 150 days, potentially taking some of the bite out of his tariff regime.
    


            Although the US economy remains strong, with rebounding retail sales, a still-robust labor market and rising consumer confidence, there is some evidence that inflation in key areas is starting to creep higher – slowly – because of tariffs. That's a potential warning sign as the tariffs take full effect.
    


            The Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index earlier this month showed that some tariff-affected goods have started to gain in price. Clothing, appliances, computers, sporting goods, toys, video equipment, hardware and tools prices have been on the rise. And it's starting to become a trend – in many of those categories, the rise has been happening for a few months.
    


            Many major retailers, including Walmart, have said they will raise prices because of tariffs. Procter & Gamble, which makes Tide and a host of consumer goods, said Tuesday it will raise prices in part because of tariffs. And GM, Volkswagen and Stellantis all reported tariff charges of $1 billion or more over the past quarter.
    


            Economists widely expect inflation to pick up in the late summer and throughout the rest of the year as retailers work through the inventories of goods they had stockpiled before tariffs went into effect. No one expects anything close to the inflation crisis of a few years ago. But with consumers still dealing with price-hike PTSD, that won't be a welcome change from the return to healthy inflation levels over the past year.

Former DEA Senior Special Agent Michael Brown discussed the Tren de Aragua gang's threat in the United States.

United States Customs and Border Patrol caught an alleged Tren de Aragua gang member during a traffic stop near Detroit Wednesday.

The traffic stop in Shelby Township by Maryville Station CBP officers was triggered by a fake license plate on a vehicle. CBP said the three people inside the car were all in the United States illegally, and one of them is Venezulean national Manuel Zavala-Lopez, an alleged Tren de Aragua gang member who entered the country during the Biden administration in May 2023 and was released, according to DHS. 

The group was named a foreign terrorist organization early on during President Donald Trump's second term, along with MS-13. Some of those alleged members have been sent to the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador for detention.

FBI TAKES DOWN ANTI-TREN GANG MEMBERS IN LARGEST BUST YET IN VIOLENT MIGRANT TURF WAR

""Zavala-Lopez is a serial criminal who's traveled across the U.S. committing violent crimes. He has an outstanding warrant for failure to appear on a felony assault charge in Denver, Colorado. He has also been charged with robbery resulting in physical injury, criminal possession of a weapon intent to use, assault, possession of stolen property and petty larceny in New York,"" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. 

""Thanks to our brave law enforcement, he is off the streets and will no longer be able to terrorize American citizens. He will remain in ICE custody pending removal.""

""The arrest of this Tren de Aragua gang member, who has a history of firearms and other criminal charges and was wanted on an active warrant out of Denver, Colorado, for failure to appear, removes another dangerous criminal illegal alien from our country and enhances public safety,"" Detroit Sector Chief Patrol Agent John R. Morris said in a statement.

""This marks the second arrest of a gang member from a foreign terrorist organization this month and underscores the relentless efforts of our agents and law enforcement partners. These cases highlight the critical value of interagency cooperation in removing these criminal threats from our communities,"" Morris added.

The 30-year-old, who is not named but had his mugshot disclosed by the agency, was previously charged with violent robbery as well as weapons and immigration violations, according to a news release.

""This Tren de Aragua gang member, who had no business being in our country, let alone roaming the streets of Shelby Township, serves as our department's commitment to keeping our community safe and getting dangerous individuals like this out of our community,"" Lt. Mark Benedettini of the Shelby Township Police Department told Fox News Digital in an email.

TRUMP'S CRACKDOWN NETS OVER 2,700 ALLEGED MEMBERS OF NOTORIOUS VENEZUELAN GANG

Traffic stops are considered a major aspect of border and immigration enforcement, and people and drugs are often caught as a result. 

Two Salvadoran nationals in the country illegally were also arrested by CBP in Detroit earlier this month, the agency announced July 10.

Border Patrol agents responded after a call for extra help during an ""altercation"" at a motel in Sterling Heights.

One of the men ""admitted"" to being a member of MS-13 and said he previously served 20 years behind bars in the Central American country for killing someone from a rival gang.

""This is a major win for the U.S. Border Patrol and the safety of our communities,"" Detroit Sector Acting Chief Patrol Agent Javier Geronimo Jr. said in a statement at the time.

Health officials are taking action against a substance that some are calling ""gas station heroin."" The FDA is recommending that 7-hydroxymitragynine (also known as 7-OH) — a byproduct of the plant kratom — be classified as a Schedule I drug.

HHS Secretary RFK Jr. and FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary emphasized the importance of getting ahead of yet another wave of addiction before it can sweep across the country. Makary compared the distribution of 7-OH to the early days of opioid prescriptions, before doctors understood the addictive nature of painkillers.

US Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. speaks alongside Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary (L) about the sending of warning letters to companies for illegally marketing products containing 7-hydroxymitragynine, also known as 7-OH, as part of their actions combatting opioids, during a press conference at HHS headquarters in Washington, D.C., on July 29, 2025.  (SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)

MEDICAL GROUPS URGE KENNEDY, FDA TO REEXAMINE BROAD APPROVAL OF ABORTION DRUGS

""Vape stores are popping up in every neighborhood in America, and many are selling addictive products like concentrated 7-OH. After the last wave of the opioid epidemic, we cannot get caught flat-footed again,"" Makary said in an FDA statement. ""7-OH is an opioid that can be more potent than morphine. We need regulation and public education to prevent another wave of the opioid epidemic.""

During a news conference on Tuesday, Makary suggested that the public health community is often late to act against dangerous substances due to a ""disconnect between the ivory towers and the streets."" He then pondered aloud if experts had been to vape stores, as it ""affects what we see in the operating room.""

According to the FDA, 7-OH is beginning to be recognized for its potential to be abused because of its ability to bind to opioid receptors. Additionally, the substance is widely available and may be appealing to children and teens as it is sold in fruit-flavored gummies and even ice cream cones. The FDA is also warning that 7-OH products ""may not be clearly or accurately labeled as to their 7-OH content and are sometimes disguised or marketed as kratom.""

""I am in favor of this move because of the relationship of the 7-OH to the opioid receptors. This is essentially an opioid. It is semisynthetic and derived from the kratom plant whose leaves make a stimulant.

FDA SAYS ‘DANGEROUS' SUBSTANCE KNOWN AS ‘GAS STATION HEROIN' POSES MAJOR RISK TO YOUNG PEOPLE

Kennedy spoke about his own battle with heroin addiction. The HHS secretary described his ""iron willpower"" and how he gave up candy and desserts for years, making him feel as though he could do anything, until he got his hands on heroin.

""I felt that I could do anything with my willpower, but this compulsion was absolutely impervious to my will, and part of the problem was just the availability. It was too easy to get this drug for me,"" Kennedy said.

He also noted that President Donald Trump's family has also grappled with addiction. Though the president has been sober his entire life, his brother, Fred Trump Jr., struggled with alcoholism for much of his life and died at the age of 43.

""I had a brother, Fred, great guy,"" Trump said about his brother in 2017. ""But he had a problem. He had a problem with alcohol. And he would tell me, ‘Don't drink. Don't drink.'""

Trump said at the time that he listened to his brother because he ""respected him,"" adding that ""to this day, I've never had a drink.""

Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., who attended the news conference, supported the recommendation based on his family's experience with addiction, though he did not detail exactly to whom he was referring.

""It's an addiction that is ruining lives,"" Mullin said at a Tuesday news conference. He went on to thank Kennedy on behalf of his own family and ""every single family that has dealt with this"" for acting against the powerful drug.

The CDC reported in May that drug overdose deaths in the country dropped in 2024. The U.S. saw ""80,391 drug overdose deaths in the United States during 2024 — a decrease of 26.9% from the 110,037 deaths estimated in 2023."" Additionally, the CDC found that ""overdose deaths involving opioids decreased from an estimated 83,140 in 2023 to 54,743 in 2024.""

Kratom, the plant from which 7-OH is derived, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. The FDA notes that kratom is often used to self-treat a variety of conditions, such as pain, anxiety and depression. The agency notes that it has not approved any prescription or over-the-counter drug products containing kratom or its two main chemical components: mitragynine and 7-OH.

Rep. Tim Burchett (R-TN) went to the hospital on Sunday with a broken rib after a horse kicked him in the chest, according to his office.

“While working on his farm over the weekend, Congressman Burchett was accidentally kicked by a horse. He suffered a broken rib and bruising but hasn't missed a beat,” said Will Garrett, a spokesman for Burchett.

Burchett's wife drove him to the hospital, where he was examined and discharged the same day. He has since maintained a normal schedule back in his Knoxville, Tennessee-based district, meeting constituents and party officials with the House on recess for August.

“He spoke in Maury County last night and has a full slate of district events throughout the week,” said Garrett. “There have been no changes to his schedule.”

Sunday's incident, which was not previously reported, is not Burchett's first injury. In 2012, he broke his wrist in a motorcycle crash after his back tire blew out.

New York City Mayor Eric Adams said Tuesday that a gunman who killed four people at a Manhattan office building was attempting to target the NFL headquarters.

Investigators believe the suspect, Shane Tamura, was attempting to gain access to offices after shooting several people in the building's lobby. They said he took the wrong elevator, however.

Four people were killed on Monday. The 27-year-old shooter died of self-inflicted wounds.

A note found on the gunman's body suggested he had a grievance against the NFL and that he was suffering from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, according to the Associated Press. CTE has been linked to repeated concussions in athletes in high-contact sports, including football.

A motive has not yet been determined.

Former President Joe Biden's open border immigration crisis led to an “extraordinary” surge in legal and illegal migrants into the United States and new population highs in 31 states and the District of Columbia.

According to census data, the growth cemented the long-changing migration trend from the East to the South, which has seen a 578% increase in the foreign-born population.

During Biden's four years, California added 1.4 million migrants and Texas 1 million, but several other states shared in the burden of having a huge influx arrive to compete for jobs and taxpayer-funded social services, according to an analysis of the data by the Center for Immigration Studies.

Under Biden, millions of migrants came to America, mostly illegally. “Illegal immigrants accounted for 5.4 million or two-thirds of the 8.3 million growth in the foreign-born population,” said the center in an earlier report on the overall numbers.

The think tank said the surge has been a decadeslong event. “The increases at the sub-national level in many parts of the country in the last 45 years can only be described as extraordinary,” it said.

It used that word again when it revealed where new illegal and legal migrants are landing: “The South now has the largest immigrant population. The increase has been extraordinary,” said the report, which focused on where Biden-era border crossers ended up.

“The border surge contributed to very large increases in the number of immigrants in just the last four years in many states,” the report continued. “From the first quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of 2025 the foreign-born population grew by more than one-third in 16 states.”

In dishing numbers, it added, “Numerically the largest increases in the foreign-born population from 2021 to 2025 were in California, up 1.4 million; Texas, up one million; Florida, up 828,000; Pennsylvania, up 433,000; Georgia, up 413,000; Maryland, up 396,000; Indiana, up 339,000; Massachusetts, up 327,000; and Washington, up 311,000.”

And, it said, “In the first quarter of 2025, the foreign-born share of the population hit historic highs in 14 states: Alabama, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Maryland, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. Numerically, the foreign-born population hit record highs in 31 states plus the District of Columbia.”

“Our analysis of the size of the growth of the foreign-born population across the country shows that it has become a truly national issue in a way that was not the case four and a half decades ago,” the report concluded. “This is likely to be true for the foreseeable future.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Dear James,

I rarely ever think about past events unless explicitly reminded, and I wonder if I'm missing out on some core human experience. It's not that I can't or won't reminisce; I have a pretty good memory, and I'm happy to relive old scenes when my partner or family prompt me. I don't dwell much on past failures and embarrassments, but I'm also not living entirely in the present—indeed, I tend to obsessively worry about the future. So what am I missing? Should I be making an effort to look backwards more often?

Dear Reader,

I want some of what you're on.

Me, I'm a nurser of ancient grievances. I believe in forgiveness, but then again—do I? If you pushed me around in 1982, ripped me off in 1997, failed to be sufficiently fascinated by me in 2013, I haven't forgotten, and vengeance will be mine. Not to mention the grievances against myself: For them I get revenge every day, and rather painfully too.

Oh, to leave the past behind! To dump it, toss it overboard, and tread blithely as a lamb into the eternal welcome of the present moment! But I dunno, something in the wiring (mine, anyway) won't allow it. Is it evolutionary? Are we meant to drag all our mistakes around with us—plus the bruises to our nature, plus the dilapidated hulk of our crappy memories—so as to avoid them next time? As Kingsley Amis wrote to a friend after his second divorce: “Well, it's all experience, though it's a pity there had to be so much of it.”

So what's my advice? Only this: If you find yourself able to stay clear of the shadow of what's already happened, I'd say that's something of a superpower. You might consider using it out there in the world, this mutant gift of yours. Use it for good. Seek out people who offended you, or who worry they may have wronged you at some point, and tell them it doesn't matter. Seek out anybody—why not?—who's guilty or ashamed or bogged down with regret, and tell them they're free.

Hauling my deluxe, personalized baggage,

James

Eloghosa Osunde's new book offers a vision of kinship for a world that is steadily growing more disconnected.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

In the summer of 2018, I found myself enraptured by the television show Pose, a first-of-its-kind drama that featured a cast of Black and brown transgender performers. Much of the press around the series—nearly all of it, actually—highlighted this fact, and I approached the show with some trepidation, expecting it to feature gauzy, conventional storylines in an attempt to attract a mainstream audience. Indeed, amid its gritty sequences of emotional turmoil was a focus on the most conventional television theme of all—the obligations and joys of family life. But this turned out to be Pose's most interesting asset, because what distinguished its kitchen-table scenes from others, and its family from my own, was that each member had chosen to be there.

Pose presents the concept of chosen family as both a necessary lifeline for trans people and an enthralling and recurrent act of love. These characters, and the real people whose lives served as inspiration for them, choose one another continually, though their bonds are often not recognized by external authorities. Those of us seeking to build meaningful connections to people with whom we share little but our common humanity might have something to learn from them.

I thought of Pose a great deal while reading Necessary Fiction, the Nigerian writer Eloghosa Osunde's second novel. The book follows a group of queer Nigerian characters who fit awkwardly within their biological communities and who, as a result, must form new ones. Families are the driving force of this novel, and Osunde depicts them in various forms: families falling apart as they bicker and grow in different directions, families that have all but ceased to function, and newly formed families, fragile and delicately wrought. Osunde's characters pursue degrees and jobs, and they seek self-actualization, but their understanding of life is filtered almost entirely through their closest relationships.

Osunde has published this novel amid a flood of LGBTQ literature from Africa, and specifically Nigeria, that is perhaps a reaction to the sorry state of gay rights across the continent. Yet Necessary Fiction is singular because it subtly transposes an idea that recurs in queer media—that families are both essential and malleable—to a broader tapestry of human lives, the billions of us around the globe who find ourselves isolated despite our reliance on tools that promise connection. By unbinding family from biological duty, the novel imagines connection as an act of sustained intention, not inherited obligation. It offers not only a story about queer life in Nigeria, but also a vision of how kinship might evolve for everyone in a world of increasing mobility, urbanization, and atomization.

Read: What to read when you want to reimagine family

Necessary Fiction includes a sprawling cast of characters whose connections vary in depth and intensity—Osunde helpfully provides a list at the beginning of the book—and throughout the novel we meet small clusters of them, observing as they attract or repel one another. Yet the most vital and arresting moment occurs 19 pages in, well before Osunde has formally introduced most of the novel's players. In a chapter titled “Truth Circle,” a group of queer friends discuss their lives, relationships, and regrets in a 10-page scene that unfolds entirely in dialogue.

They remember the tragic 2020 Lekki massacre in Lagos State, when soldiers opened fire on unarmed protestors; they share stories of estrangement from their direct kin; they reflect on the overwhelming burden of projecting strength even as they unravel internally; they explore the shifting definitions of what it means to be “normal.”

Threaded through all this heaviness, however, is a palpable joy, a kind of luminous gratitude for having found one another, despite their presence in a country that routinely shuns them. One character, reflecting on the recent loss of a loved one, says that they “also feel thanks, because who wouldn't have reasons to, with people like you as fam? You guys are that for me.”

The “truth circle” in this scene is a space of confession and free expression, but it is also a crucible in which the characters create and affirm their bonds to one another. Over the course of these pages, the reader begins to discern the outlines of their relationships through hints about how they came to know and care for one another. But most important, Osunde introduces them immediately as a family, inviting readers to think of people they don't yet know as parts of a coherent whole, one they have forged in order to survive.

Osunde also reminds the reader how deeply vulnerable, and deeply restorative, conversations among family members can be when they're sustained through loyalty and mutual respect. Though grounded in queer experience, the scene's emotional resonance extends beyond it. Osunde seems to be proposing a model of kinship that could serve anyone navigating alienation or rupture.

As the book progresses, we learn more about the people who were present at the truth circle, and eventually one character, a DJ named May, takes center stage. Osunde describes May as a “free” person, someone “even rebels look up to and say, Wow, you're so brave.” She has a tense relationship with her father, a man of “unending charisma and gaslighting,” and recognizes “that something about her mother was different, that she had an askewness to her that her friends' mothers did not have.” One point of friction between mother and daughter is May's gender identity; as May grows older, her mother begins to understand that “May was not the daughter she was raising. May was something else beyond that—something more manly than a daughter, more feminine than a son—an inbetweener.”

Read: A redacted past slowly emerges

One day May calls home and learns that her mother is in the hospital after her father insisted on “yet another psychiatric hold.” May falls into despair and confides in her roommates, twins who were present at the truth circle. She confesses that she longs for a motherly presence, and the twins introduce her to their aunt, who goes by “Aunty G” (we eventually learn the “G” stands for “Gladness”). What follows is one of the most quietly transformative relationships in the book. May eventually tells Aunty G about her love life, something she never felt comfortable doing with her own mother. Osunde captures the poignancy of this connection:

It wasn't that Aunty G was a replacement mother or anything. Aunty G was just the elder of her dreams, someone who had seen enough life to not be fazed by her choices. May thought often about what a difference it would have made if she was known (or loved) by a woman like Gladness when she was stumbling around in the dark. And now here she was.

Through the twins' intervention, May gains the mother figure she was looking for, someone who offers the kind of counsel her own parents never could. Osunde's depiction of this bond—its gradual deepening, its subtle healing—reinforces the novel's central insight: that family is not a fixed inheritance but an evolving architecture.

In recent years, there has been much talk about people spending more and more time alone. According to a 2023 analysis by the U.S. Surgeon General, “half of U.S. adults report experiencing loneliness.” Medical professionals and social scientists have proposed a few potential causes, including the disappearance of “third places” and the increasing ubiquity of the internet and social media, which may facilitate connections, but at the expense of meaningful—and essential—in-person interactions.

In Necessary Fiction and other stories revolving around LGBTQ lives, we can glimpse the kind of community the internet once promised. No matter how advanced our technology becomes, it is not a replacement for the rituals that make us human, such as gathering around a dinner table after a long day apart, and telling honest and vulnerable stories as your family sits close, listens, and remains.

We have a long way to go in understanding the brain injury implicated in the NYC shooting.

On Monday evening in Midtown Manhattan, a 27-year-old gunman opened fire in an office building that houses NFL offices, killing four people, including a police officer and then himself. In a note left in his wallet, the shooter referenced chronic traumatic encephalopathy, commonly called by its initials CTE, and criticized the NFL for covering up the traumatic brain effects of playing football.

“Study my brain please,” read the note left by the shooter, who was a former high school football player, according to the New York Times. The Times reported that the note also included references to NFL players who had also committed violent acts and were then diagnosed with CTE after their deaths. The shooter shot himself in the chest rather than in the head, following the example of retired NFL Hall of Famer Junior Seau. Seau's suicide in 2012, which reportedly followed his own mood changes, helped bring the link between an NFL career and CTE to the public's attention after his autopsy found evidence of the disease.

More than a decade later, like many mental health conditions, CTE remains mysterious.

The condition cannot be accurately diagnosed until after death and symptoms, such as trouble thinking clearly, can be hard to identify and easily confused with other neurological problems. We are still learning exactly how many people have CTE and exactly how much trauma is necessary for the disease to develop.

Here's what we know and what we don't, as another tragedy puts CTE back in the news.

Befrienders Worldwide

Chronic traumatic encephalopathy is a degenerative brain disease, believed to be caused by repeated head injuries. Though more research on the condition is needed, scientists do not believe that a single head injury, such as a concussion, alone can cause CTE. In a person with CTE, nerve cells in their brain die, compromising mental functions. It was first described as “punch-drunk syndrome” in boxers in the 1920s, before attracting more attention in the 2000s after autopsies of former football players revealed the extent of their brain trauma. The death of Seau, an eight-time All-Pro linebacker, forced the NFL and the American public to take the toll on players' brains more seriously, starting a debate that continues to this day.

CTE is most commonly associated with professional athletes who play contact sports, especially football and hockey, but has also been associated with those serving in the military. Other people, particularly victims of physical abuse, can also be at an elevated risk — the only known risk factor is recurring brain trauma.

It seems like a straightforward question, but scientists and public health providers still don't have the full picture. Part of the challenge in recognizing CTE is that its symptoms are vague and can be confused with other forms of dementia, even Alzheimer's disease in older patients. According to the Mayo Clinic, there are not specific behavioral or physical changes that are unique to CTE. But some of the commonly cited symptoms include:

Experts think that younger patients with CTE are more likely to experience mood changes, while older patients endure more of the memory loss and are unable to think clearly, which can progress to more advanced dementia, according to Mayo.

Patients are encouraged to get in touch with a health care professional if they experience any of those symptoms or if they suffer a serious head injury that could lead to brain damage.

Unfortunately, there's no way to diagnose CTE in a living person. Currently, brain samples must be removed from the person and studied under a microscope — something that is not safe for a living patient.

To diagnose CTE with certainty after a person's death, an autopsy collects evidence of damaged brain tissue as well as the build-up of tau proteins that have also been associated with Alzheimer's disease.

This is obviously suboptimal: If we are ever to develop better interventions and treatments, we need to be able to diagnose people who are still alive with CTE. Scientists are working on new tests that would look for biomarkers in saliva or blood that could tell scientists that a person has the condition. New imaging technology could also provide a path to earlier CTE diagnosis.

But for now, in living people, doctors can still attempt to screen for CTE as well as other similar conditions. If medical professionals suspect CTE, they will diagnose a patient with what is called traumatic encephalopathy syndrome, and provide behavioral or occupational therapy. That's why doctors still urge people who worry they could have CTE to get checked out.

There is also no specific treatment for CTE; in general, nerve cells that die in the brain cannot be revived, which means the damage done by CTE cannot be reversed through medicine.

We don't know — but it may be close. A 2023 study from Boston University's CTE Center found that 345 of the 376 former NFL players whose brains they studied had the condition. Though the authors cautioned against interpreting that finding to mean 90 percent of players have CTE — the brains donated to brain banks may not be representative of all players — the research would seem to suggest that playing a sport that involves violently crashing into other people, even with helmets and padding, leads to a higher chance of having brain damage.

Part of the mystery with CTE is it's not clear why some people develop it and other people don't. Repeated head injuries clearly put you at risk — a separate BU study of NHL players concluded that the risk of CTE increased by 34 percent for every season played — but they are not enough on their own. Scientists still have more to learn about what causes some people to develop CTE while other people do not.

Most of us, of course, do not play professional football or hockey. But that doesn't mean we should ignore CTE's risks. Some jobs, such as serving in the military or working in construction, can lead to frequent head injuries. New studies indicate even younger kids playing recreational sports face some danger of CTE. According to the Mayo Clinic, patients may also face a higher risk if they experience one head trauma and then another in quick succession, before their first injury can heal.

One study published in JAMA Neurology in 2023 focused specifically on people who died before the age of 30 and were known to have repeated head injuries. In the study, the most common causes of death were suicide or drug overdose. The researchers found 40 percent of the people studied had at least a mild form of CTE; among those with the condition, 70 percent had played a variety of sports at the amateur level — in youth leagues, high school or college.

Clearly, being an NFL lineman or NHL enforcer isn't the only way to develop CTE. Concerns have been raised about the accumulations of the micro-traumas that occur when, for example, heading a ball in soccer. Volleyball players, too, can be concussed during game play, which at least opens up the possibility of CTE risk.

The science on CTE is still evolving. But what should be clear after this week's shooting in New York City is we need to make more progress quickly to prevent more tragedies.

Business Insider Edition 

In a major geopolitical development, Niger has signed a nuclear cooperation agreement with Russia, marking the completion of a broader deal between Moscow and the three military-led governments of the Alliance of Sahel States (AES)—Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger.


        The agreement, which focuses on the peaceful use of nuclear energy, will see Russia's Rosatom assist these West African nations in developing nuclear infrastructure, including the construction of power plants and research reactors, as well as the supply of nuclear fuel.
    


        The announcement was made on July 28 by the press office of Russia's Ministry of Energy.
    


        “During today's meeting, an important memorandum of cooperation in the field of peaceful atom was signed. Our task is not just to participate in the extraction of uranium, we must create an entire system for the development of a peaceful atom in Niger,” Russian Energy Minister Sergei Tsivilev stated via the ministry's official Telegram channel.
    


        Tsivilev added that the memorandum outlines collaboration on multiple fronts, including “the construction of nuclear power plants (NPP), nuclear medicine, and joint training of specialists in this field.”
    


        The deal highlights Russia's long-term strategy to build a nuclear development ecosystem in Africa's military-led states and signals a new phase of strategic engagement in the Sahel.
    


        This deal marks the latest sign of deepening ties between Russia and Africa's transitional governments, which have increasingly turned to Moscow for diplomatic and technological support amid strained relations with Western powers.
    


        Last month, the Russian government approved similar civil nuclear cooperation agreements with Mali and Burkina Faso, signaling Moscow's long-term intent to expand its energy partnerships and influence across the strategically important Sahel region.
    


        Russia and Burkina Faso concluded their agreement at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF), with Rosatom Director General Alexey Likhachev signing on behalf of Russia, and Burkina Faso's Minister of Energy, Mines and Quarries, Yacouba Zabré Gouba, signing on behalf of Ouagadougou.
    


        Likewise, Russia and Mali formalized their cooperation in Moscow, where Likhachev signed the agreement alongside Malian Minister of Energy and Water Resources, Boubacar Diane.
    


        For the Alliance of Sahel States (AES)—comprising Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger—this growing nuclear partnership is seen as a bold move toward energy sovereignty and long-term economic resilience, amid persistent power shortages, population growth, and infrastructure gaps.
    


        The agreements also reflect the evolving global realignment in the wake of the Ukraine conflict, with Russia increasingly positioning itself as a strategic ally to African governments looking beyond Western-led institutions for support and investment.

Wesley LePatner, a star executive in Blackstone's real estate business, was among those killed on Monday by a gunman who entered the company's Park Avenue offices.

LePatner, 43 years old, was the $1.2 trillion firm's global head of Core+ real estate and CEO of Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, the company's juggernaut real estate fund for individual investors. Her death has left staff at the New York-based asset manager ""heartbroken,"" the private equity giant said in a statement Tuesday morning.

LePatner is one of four victims, including a New York Police Department officer, who lost their lives to the gunman, who has been identified by the police as 27-year-old Shane Tamura. The gunman died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound on the 33rd floor of 345 Park Avenue, a skyscraper home to major financial institutions and the NFL's headquarters.

""Words cannot express the devastation we feel. Wesley was a beloved member of the Blackstone family and will be sorely missed. She was brilliant, passionate, warm, generous, and deeply respected within our firm and beyond. She embodied the best of Blackstone,"" the statement continued.

LePatner attended the elite NYC private school Horace Mann and Yale University. She joined Goldman Sachs following her graduation, where she worked for over a decade. She joined Blackstone in 2014 when its core assets portfolio, which invests in commercial properties like warehouses, office buildings, rental housing, and hotels, was a nascent investment category. She helped launch BREIT in 2017, which has become a major piece of the private equity firm's push to attract funds from wealthy individuals.Business Insider profiled LePatner in 2022 as a power player in Blackstone's real estate team. Back then, she said that her unit was, ""for all intents and purposes, a startup.""

""I faced all the challenges one could imagine when building a multibillion-dollar business — from hiring to ensuring standards remain high, moving quickly to keep up with growth, and staying ahead of market swings and growing pains,"" she said.

Blackstone President Jon Gray referenced her ""tremendous talent"" when it was announced she would take leadership of the investment vehicle from former BREIT CEO Frank Cohen, who stepped down in January.

LePatner was also involved in developing mentorship opportunities for women at Blackstone. She served as the chair for its affinity group, the Blackstone Women's Initiative. In a video interview on the firm's website, when asked if she feels there are strong opportunities for women to lead in the industry, she said, ""I am a big believer of, 'if you can see it, you can be it,'"" referencing her high-profile colleagues Kathleen McCarthy, global co-head of real estate, and Joan Solotar, the firm's global head of private wealth solutions.

A trustee of New York's Met Museum, LePatner also served on boards for The Abraham Joshua Heschel School and the UJA-Federation of New York. The latter honored her at its Wall Street dinner in 2023. Blackstone's Gray presented her with the Alan C. Greenberg Young Leadership Award. He spoke about her ascent in finance and her support of women on Wall Street, saying ""she pays it forward from generation to generation.""

""Wesley was extraordinary in every way — personally, professionally, and philanthropically,"" the non-profit said in a statement. ""An exceptional leader in the financial world, she brought thoughtfulness, vision, and compassion to everything she did.""

She led a solidarity mission with UJA to Israel following the October 7 attack.

In her acceptance remarks, she talked about the organization's ""power to create a sense of community and belonging, and that ability to create a sense of community and belonging matters now more than ever.""LePartner is survived by her husband, Evan, and their two children.

""We cannot properly express the grief we feel upon the sudden and tragic loss of Wesley, the LePatner family said in a statement. ""She was the most loving wife, mother, daughter, sister, and relative, who enriched our lives in every way imaginable.

""To so many others, she was a beloved, fiercely loyal and caring friend, and a driven and extraordinarily talented professional and colleague.""

In this article

Spotify shares dropped 10% Tuesday after the music streaming service fell short of Wall Street's expectations and posted weak guidance for the current quarter.

Shares headed for their worst session since July 2023.

Here's how the company did versus LSEG estimates:

The Swedish platform's revenues rose 10% from about 3.81 billion euros in the year-ago period. The company posted a net loss of 86 million euros, or a loss of .42 euros per share, down from net income of 225 million euros, or 1.10 euros per share a year ago.

Spotify said that higher personnel, marketing and professional services costs and 115 million euros worth of what it called social charges contributed to the results.

Third-quarter guidance came up short of Wall Street's forecast.

The company expects revenues to reach 4.2 billion euros, compared to a 4.47 billion euro estimate from StreetAccount. Spotify said the forecast accounts for a 490-basis-point headwind due to foreign exchange rates.

Monthly active users on the platform jumped 11% to 696 million, while paying subscribers rose 12% from a year ago to 276 million. Ad-tier subscribers account for over 60% of Spotify's monthly users.

For the current quarter, Spotify said it expects to reach 710 million monthly active users, with 14 million net adds. The company expects 5 million net new premium subscribers in the third quarter to reach 281 million subscriptions.

Spotify's advertising-supported revenues declined about 1% to 453 million euros from 456 million euros a year ago. The company said it sees promise in its advertising stack and demand given its strong user base and will focus on adoption and new tools in the second half. Some areas of opportunity include business and automated ads.

""It's really an execution challenge, not a problem with the strategy,"" said CEO Daniel Ek during an earnings call. ""While I'm unhappy with where we are today, I remain confident in the ambitions we laid out for this business, and we're working quickly to ensure we're on the right path.""

Ek said the company is seeing some ""promising signs"" in its programmatic business.

During the period, Spotify said it rolled out a request feature for its artificial intelligence DJ. The company said engagement with its AI DJ has roughly doubled over the last year. Its audiobooks feature expanded to four new countries during the quarter, and listening hours jumped 35% in the U.S., U.K. and Australia.

Earlier this year, an indie rock band on the platform known as Velvet Sundown gained media attention after it quickly captured over a million new listeners and raised questions over artificial intelligence use in music creation. The ""band"" was later confirmed to be mainly AI-generated after widespread speculation.

In 2024, Spotify posted its first full year of profitability as it slashed costs and hiked prices. Over the years, the company has prioritized subscriber gains and invested beyond music in podcasts and audiobooks. Apple Music remains one of its top competitors.

Spotify said it ended the quarter with more than 7,300 full-time employees and upped its share repurchase program by $1 billion. Shares are up more than 40% this year.

In this article

Procter & Gamble on Tuesday reported quarterly results that beat Wall Street's expectations, but introduced fiscal 2026 guidance that included a $1 billion pretax hit due to higher costs from tariffs.

""We grew sales and profit in fiscal 2025 and returned high levels of cash to shareowners in a dynamic, difficult and volatile environment,"" said CEO Jon Moeller in a news release.

CFO Andre Schulten said during a media call that there will be mid-single-digit price increases affecting about a quarter of P&G's items during the first quarter of fiscal 2026 due to tariffs and innovation.

He added on a call with analysts that the tariff hit can be broken down into a $200 million impact related to items imported from China, another $200 million related to Canada's tariffs on goods shipped from the U.S. and the remaining $600 million from tariffs involving the rest of the world.

P&G has invested significantly in the U.S., Schulten said, but some ingredients and materials are not available in the U.S. and continue to be imported. He said P&G can offset most of the tariff hit through productivity or sourcing changes, but some of the costs will be passed on through price increases.

He described the consumer as ""value-seeking"" and ""selective.""

The consumer products giant, which owns brands such as Tide and Charmin, expects fiscal 2026 sales growth of between 1% and 5% and earnings per share in the range of $6.83 to $7.09. The company said that factors in an estimated headwind of 39 cents per share for fiscal 2026, or a 6% drag on core earnings per share growth, related to President Donald Trump's tariffs, unfavorable commodity costs, higher net interest expense and its core effective tax rate.

Wall Street analysts were expecting 2026 revenue growth of 3.1% and earnings per share of $6.99, according to LSEG.

On a call with analysts, Schulten said there is a level of ""baseline uncertainty"" baked into the 2026 outlook given economic volatility and a ""more careful"" consumer.

The company's results come just one day after P&G announced Shailesh Jejurikar, its chief operating officer, would succeed Moeller as chief executive, effective Jan. 1. Moeller will transition to the role of executive chairman on that date.

Here's what Procter & Gamble reported for its fiscal fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

P&G reported net income of $3.62 billion, or $1.48 per share for the three-month period ended June 30, up from $3.14 billion, or $1.27 per share, a year earlier.

Net sales rose 2% to $20.89 billion. Organic sales, which strip out acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency, also climbed 2%.

Schulten said during the media call that sales volume, which excludes pricing and therefore more accurately reflects demand, was in line with the prior year. P&G's health-care division reported a 2% decline in volume, while the beauty segment saw a 1% increase.

The United States is P&G's largest market, followed by China. Schulten said the China business grew 2% in terms of organic sales during the quarter, but total consumption in the market is still down about 2% compared with a year earlier.

The fiscal 2026 guidance comes after P&G trimmed its outlook in April for the rest of the company's fiscal 2025 year, citing consumer uncertainty and tariffs. Moeller said at the time that price hikes tied to tariffs would occur during the company's fiscal 2026 year, which began this month.

Schulten also said in April that tariffs would hurt P&G's growth by a range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion per year.

Both JPMorgan and Evercore downgraded PG earlier this month. The former predicted soft organic sales and the latter pointed to share losses within Amazon as a concern amid a growing shift toward online retail.

The company announced a restructuring plan in June focused on improving its cost structure and competitiveness through changes in portfolio, supply chain and organizational design. As part of that plan, P&G announced at the time it will cut 7,000 nonmanufacturing roles, roughly 15% of that workforce, over the next two years.

Procter & Gamble shares are down about 6% year to date.

In this article

Baker Hughes said on Tuesday it will buy Chart Industries in a $13.6 billion all-cash deal, including debt, to expand in the LNG, data centers and decarbonization segments, edging out rival suitor Flowserve. 

The deal is part of Baker Hughes' efforts to leverage its industrial and energy technology portfolio, which helped boost second-quarter earnings, and adds to the ongoing consolidation in the oilfield services and industrial supply sector.

The company has offered Chart Industries' shareholders $210 per share held, representing a premium of about 22% based on the last close. Chart Industries shares were up 16.2% at $199.50 in premarket trading.

The deal follows Chart's termination of a prior deal to merge with Flowserve, which decided not to raise its bid after being told Baker Hughes' proposal was ""superior"".

Shares of Flowserve, which will receive a $266 million breakup fee, were up 4.36% at $57.25 in premarket trading. Flowserve's all-stock bid valued Chart at $159.98 per share, according to Reuters calculations.

The transaction has an equity value of about $9.44 billion, according to Reuters' calculation. It is expected to close by mid-year 2026.

Chart manufactures industrial equipment such as valves and measurement technology for gas and liquid molecule handling.

Baker Hughes said $325 million in annualized cost synergies were expected to be realized at the end of the third year.

In this article

Union Pacific said on Tuesday it would buy smaller rival Norfolk Southern in an $85 billion deal, to create the nation's first coast-to-coast freight rail operator and reshape the movement of goods from grains to autos across the country.

If approved, the deal would combine Union Pacific's stronghold in the western two-thirds of the U.S. with Norfolk's 19,500-mile network that primarily spans 22 eastern states.

This would mark the largest-ever buyout in the sector, merging Union Pacific, the biggest U.S. railroad operator, with Norfolk, one of the top players, granting the combined company transcontinental dominance.

On Thursday, the two companies had said they were in advanced discussion for a possible merger.

The transaction faces numerous regulatory hurdles and will serve as a key test of the changed thinking around antitrust issues under President Donald Trump.

Since early 2025, the U.S. Surface Transportation Board, the federal regulatory agency overseeing railroads, has signaled a more industry-friendly approach to merger reviews.

Chairman Patrick Fuchs, appointed to the post in January by Trump, has advocated for faster timelines for preliminary assessments, a greater focus on competitive balance rather than blocking consolidation, and a willingness to enforce conditions post-merger rather than deny deals preemptively.

The talks have also prompted competitors BNSF, owned by Berkshire Hathaway, and CSX to explore merger options, people familiar with the matter said.

Union Pacific's deal for Norfolk would also need support from labor unions and could invite scrutiny from several other federal agencies.

Major railroad unions have long opposed consolidation, arguing that such mergers threaten jobs and risk disrupting rail service.

The North American rail industry has been grappling with volatile freight volumes, rising labor and fuel costs, and growing pressure from shippers over service reliability, factors that could further complicate the merger.

The last major deal in the industry was the $31 billion merger of Canadian Pacific and Kansas City Southern, which created the first and only single-line rail network connecting Canada, the U.S., and Mexico.

That deal, finalized in 2023, faced heavy regulatory resistance over fears it would curb competition, cut jobs, and disrupt service, but it was ultimately approved.

 Backed by Cantor Fitzgerald, Tether and SoftBank, Twenty One Capital now holds over 43,500 BTC, surpassing early projections, according to Bloomberg. 

Cantor Fitzgerald-backed Twenty One Capital has significantly increased its Bitcoin (BTC) holdings, expanding its treasury beyond the amount announced at launch, highlighting the accelerating race to accumulate the digital asset. 

The Bitcoin treasury firm, which launched in April with a mission to amass the digital asset, has added approximately 5,800 BTC from stablecoin issuer Tether, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.

By Bloomberg's estimation, Twenty One Capital's total Bitcoin holdings have now reached at least 43,500 BTC, roughly 1,500 BTC more than the company had initially projected.

At current prices, Twenty One's Bitcoin holdings are worth roughly $5.13 billion. 

In addition to its ties to Cantor Fitzgerald, Twenty One Capital is backed by crypto firms Tether and Bitfinex, along with venture capital giant SoftBank. Its planned merger with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Cantor Equity Partners will pave the way for Twenty One Capital to go public.

As Cointelegraph reported on June 3, Tether transferred 37,229.69 BTC to addresses associated with Twenty One Capital as part of the company's initial Bitcoin commitment. 

The firm is led by Strike CEO and Bitcoin advocate Jack Mallers.

Twenty One Capital is one of several firms accumulating Bitcoin in the wake of Michael Saylor's Strategy, which has acquired over 607,000 BTC since mid-2020.

Unlike Strategy and other companies, however, Twenty One Capital has not relied on debt to finance its Bitcoin purchases. Even so, its holdings are quickly approaching those of Bitcoin miner MARA Holdings, which has amassed 50,000 BTC.

Alongside MARA, Bitcoin miners Riot Platforms, CleanSpark and Hut 8 rank among the largest corporate BTC holders. As Cointelegraph reported, this reflects a growing “hodl strategy” that resurfaced in 2024, with miners opting to hold onto a significant share of their mined Bitcoin, partly in anticipation of future price gains.

Beyond mining firms, several non-crypto companies have also added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, including Japanese textile manufacturer Kitabo, medical technology firm Semler Scientific and electric powersports company Volcon.

Oops, something went wrong

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.

Billionaire investor Ray Dalio advised a 15% portfolio allocation to Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) or gold, citing mounting U.S. debt concerns and potential currency devaluation risks.

What Happened: The Bridgewater Associates founder warned of a “classic devaluation” scenario similar to the 1970s or 1930s in an appearance on the Master Investor Podcast, where fiat currencies could decline together against hard assets.

“If you were neutral on everything and optimizing your portfolio for the best return-to-risk ratio, you would have about 15% of your money in gold or Bitcoin,” Dalio stated.

Dalio expressed a strong preference for gold over Bitcoin, previously describing the precious metal as the “purest play” for a store of value. Gold currently ranks as the second-largest reserve currency globally after the U.S. dollar, he noted. The billionaire holds both assets but maintains significantly larger gold positions than Bitcoin allocations.

Why It Matters: The veteran investor highlighted critical fiscal challenges facing the United States. Federal government debt stands at 125% of GDP, with the fiscal deficit reaching 7% of GDP—the highest among industrialized nations.

Dalio proposed a “3% solution” requiring immediate action to reduce the deficit from 7.5% to 3% of GDP through combined tax increases and spending cuts.

While acknowledging Bitcoin's perceived value as alternative money with limited supply and global transaction benefits, Dalio questioned its effectiveness as a reserve currency.

 Declan Fox, global product lead for Linea, said there is no exact date for the token generation event yet, but details will be shared a week before. 

The Consensys-developed Linea network says it will become one of the first Ethereum layer-2 networks to commit to burning Ether as part of its network design, as it shared new details of its upcoming token generation event and airdrop. 

Linea announced new staking and burning mechanisms for its upcoming token launch in an effort to become more aligned with the layer-1 blockchain, which it hopes will make the network the “home for ETH capital,” according to a statement sent to Cointelegraph. 

The move comes amid growing concern that layer-2 networks have been leeching chain activity and fee income from the Ethereum mainnet. 

A LINEA token generation event is set to take place later this year, with 85% of the token supply going to the ecosystem, and the remaining 15% will be allocated to the Consensys treasury under a five-year lockup.

Declan Fox, global product lead for Linea, told Cointelegraph that they did not have the exact date for the token generation event and would share airdrop criteria up to a week before the event. 

A new staking mechanism, which is expected to be launched in October, will enable users to earn staking rewards even when they bridge Ether (ETH) to Linea. This makes the ETH productive as it can also be used for DeFi activities on the layer-2 network. 

“Linea is the only L2 with total Ethereum compatibility, and we wanted the economics to be as aligned and supportive as the technology,” said Joseph Lubin, founder and CEO of Consensys.

He explained that harvested staking rewards are distributed on Linea to DeFi protocols, boosting yield for active liquidity.

Additionally, 20% of all Linea transaction fees will be used to burn ETH as the network becomes the first L2 to commit to burning the asset. The remaining 80% burns LINEA tokens, making them deflationary too.

Linea has just 1.23% of the rollup-based layer-2 market with an onchain value of around $513 million, according to L2beat. 

Fox said that there are plans to expand this by building the Linea mainnet “to be the best chain for ETH capital at a time when the momentum behind ETH is very strong.”

He added that Ether liquidity providers will find “the best risk-adjusted return by bridging liquidity to Linea, thus growing the market share.”

Consensys also announced an Ethereum-aligned consortium that will manage the Ethereum ecosystem fund. Consortium members, in addition to Consensys, include Eigen Labs, ENS Labs, Status, and Joe Lubin's ETH treasury gaming firm SharpLink. 

“Linea's commitment to Ethereum couldn't be clearer, and we think the platform's unique alignment with Ethereum will make it an important part of its future,” said Joseph Chalom, the newly appointed co-CEO of SharpLink.

Altcoins slid sharply Tuesday as traders braced for a wave of economic events, including a Federal Reserve interest rate decision due Wednesday.



Leading the pack are XRP, solana SOL$181.20 and cardano ADA$0.7783 which all fell more than 3% over the past 24 hours as well as dogecoin DOGE$0.2212, avalanche AVAX$24.10 and sui SUI$3.8256 which are down more than 5%.



The continuing sell-off has dragged XRP and SOL down about 13% over the past seven days. DOGE plunged even further, about 18% over the same period.



Bitcoin BTC$117,504.76, on the other hand, is trading roughly flat over the past 24 hours at $117,312.



Altcoins have been under pressure since early last week as traders piled into leveraged bets. A packed calendar of economic data is adding stress to both crypto and equity markets.



The U.S. Federal Reserve's two-day meeting kicked off Tuesday with Jerome Powell's team expected to leave rates unchanged yet again on Wednesday, despite pressure from President Donald Trump to lower rates.

PayPal announced the expansion of its “Pay with Crypto” platform, allowing US merchants to accept over 100 cryptocurrencies, settle transactions instantly, and reduce international fees by up to 90%.

While PayPal's stablecoin PYUSD is the clearest winner, the ripple effect across altcoins could be significant.

At the heart of PayPal's strategy is its stablecoin, PYUSD. Following the announcement, trading volume for PYUSD spiked 158%, reflecting growing interest in the coin's utility and embedded incentives.

Businesses using PayPal can now earn 4% APY on PYUSD held within their Wallet. Additional perks include instant access to proceeds, sidestepping delays, and high fees characteristic of traditional banking rails.

“Using PayPal's open platform, the business can accept crypto for payments, increase their profit margins, pay lower transaction fees, get near instant access to proceeds, and grow funds stored as PYUSD at 4%,” read an excerpt in the announcement, citing Alex Chriss, CEO of PayPal.

This move aligns with PayPal's broader vision of turning PYUSD into a native asset for global commerce. Its recent partnership with Fiserv to expand stablecoin use worldwide enhances this ambition further.

Meanwhile, the infrastructure enabling PYUSD is also in the spotlight. Blockchains that facilitate PayPal's stablecoin, like Ethereum (ETH), Arbitrum (ARB), Stellar (XLM), and Solana (SOL), are poised for increased transaction activity as more businesses tap into the platform. Solana in particular is already seeing momentum.

“Fintech giant PayPal now allows US merchants to accept over 100 cryptocurrencies, including Solana-based meme coins like TRUMP and FARTCOIN,” wrote SolanaFloor.

While meme coins remain speculative, their inclusion highlights PayPal's commitment to broad support across ecosystems.

This model could mirror the TRON (TRX) boom that followed widespread adoption of USDT on its network. The volume potential is enormous, with over 650 million crypto users globally and a $3+ trillion market cap.

Beyond infrastructure, coins directly supported for payment could experience fresh demand. PayPal revealed it will support over 100 cryptocurrencies through integrations with wallets like Coinbase, MetaMask, Phantom, OKX, Kraken, and Binance.

This includes majors like BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC, XRP, BNB, and SOL, as well as unexpected additions like TRUMP and FARTCOIN.

Solana memecoins on PayPal. Let that sink in.

As PayPal begins onboarding US merchants in the coming weeks, this broad coin acceptance could bring newfound utility to altcoins that have traditionally seen limited real-world payment use.

Ultimately, PayPal's expansion is about more than pumping a few tokens. It signals a structural shift toward crypto-native commerce, unlocking borderless payments and financial access for businesses globally.

“By enabling seamless cross-border crypto payments, we're breaking long-standing barriers in global commerce. These innovations don't just simplify payments—they drive merchant growth, expand consumer choice, and reduce costs,” said Chriss.

Billionaire investor Ray Dalio is sounding the alarm once again and this time his recommendation is clear: allocate around 15% of your portfolio to Bitcoin (or gold) as a hedge against one of the most severe fiscal crises in U.S. history.

With national debt soaring beyond $37 trillion and currency devaluation becoming an ever-present concern, Dalio's point cuts straight to the core of today's macro risks.

If you're looking to maintain a disciplined Bitcoin position over time, one tool stands out: Best Wallet (BEST). 

The leading Web3 wallet has bootstrapped over $14.3 million of early capital from investors recognizing its potential. Its roadmap includes features built specifically for long-term strategies, including one that perfectly aligns with Dalio's BTC allocation advice.

The presale is ongoing, but only until the next funding phase. At $0.025365 per BEST token, this could be one of the final low-cost entry points before the price increases in under 34 hours as the next round kicks off.

Dalio, the former co-CIO of Bridgewater Associates, the largest hedge fund in the world, has a track record of getting big calls right.

He positioned his firm defensively before the 2008 financial crisis. He correctly warned of the Eurozone debt crisis, highlighting debt sustainability risks in Southern Europe, particularly Greece, Italy, and Spain. His concept of the “beautiful deleveraging” helped shape the broader debate around austerity and stimulus.

Through the 2010s, Dalio forecast an extended low-rate environment driven by central bank policy. He cautioned that excessive quantitative easing would debase fiat currencies over time, which is a key reason he turned bullish on gold, and later, on Bitcoin.

That money printing has only accelerated. U.S. M2 money supply has now surpassed $22 trillion. Over the same period, gold – the traditional hedge – climbed from around $1,096 per ounce to over $3,324.

But gold's returns pale compared to Bitcoin. Over the last decade, BTC surged roughly 462,266,567% from its early price levels. And since 2020, it has gained an additional 16x, reaching a new all-time high just this month.

It's no surprise Dalio has raised his suggested Bitcoin allocation to 15% (though he remains partial to gold). The Bitcoin narrative grows more compelling as a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty, with strong tailwinds favoring hard-capped assets like BTC.

Institutional demand adds to this outlook. Heavy buy-side pressure suggests BTC's price may have room to appreciate further.

The question for retail traders is: what's the best way to follow Dalio's advice and build and maintain a Bitcoin position? The answer is increasingly pointing toward Best Wallet.

Best Wallet is quickly building a reputation as the leading crypto wallet, with features that align perfectly with today's market demands.

Its transactional capabilities are powered by smart integrations with over 330 decentralized protocols and more than 30 cross-chain bridges, giving users access to deep liquidity and competitive pricing across multiple networks. 

According to its roadmap, holding BEST tokens will also unlock gas token-free transactions. This design choice benefits both active traders and long-term holders by reducing costs and maximizing returns.

Onboarding has been made equally simple. With support for over 100 fiat currencies, even new users can easily convert traditional money to crypto, making BTC purchases straightforward through Best Wallet.

The upcoming Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) feature is perhaps most relevant to long-term Bitcoin allocation. This tool, which will be launched in Phase 4 of its roadmap, will allow users to automatically invest incremental amounts into BTC at set intervals, smoothing out volatility over time. 

Automated DCA removes the guesswork and emotional timing from investing, helping users steadily build exposure without the stress of short-term price swings.

By pairing automation with seamless onramps, Best Wallet makes disciplined Bitcoin accumulation easier than ever – exactly the approach that aligns with Dalio's call for a sustained BTC position.

Yet Best Wallet goes beyond crypto allocation. Part of its ongoing development focuses on integrating TradFi-style functionality directly into the wallet.

A key feature in this evolution will be Best Card, the upcoming debit card service that allows token holdings within the app to be used for real-world transactions.

That means if you've accumulated enough spare satoshis for your morning coffee, you can spend them instantly through Best Wallet in a fast, efficient, and seamless way.

The card also offers up to 8% cashback on purchases, with low-to-no fees for users holding BEST tokens.

Its attention to detail plus the consideration for real-world usability is part of why Best Wallet recently earned a WalletConnect certification, which testifies to its commitment to a smooth, reliable user experience across thousands of dApps.

Aside from a strategic and disciplined Bitcoin accumulation, Best Wallet also caters to the high-beta opportunities in crypto. One feature in particular has become a favorite among its users for its track record of spotting early-stage projects with strong upside potential.

That feature is Upcoming Tokens. Designed to surface projects the team has identified as high-potential before exchange listings, it has consistently highlighted winners ahead of the market.

Its calls include Wall Street Pepe (WEPE), up 34.7% in the past two weeks, and Solaxy (SOLX), Solana's first Layer-2 chain, which has climbed 34% in just the past week. 

Past standouts include Pepe Unchained (PEPU), which peaked at a 700% gain, Catslap (SLAP), which delivered returns exceeding 7,000%, and BTC Bull (BTCBULL), which saw a 112% return for many Best Wallet users who explored the project in Upcoming Tokens.

For users seeking more than long-term BTC strategies, Upcoming Tokens provides a way to capture potential alpha in high-performing early projects.

Taken together, Best Wallet delivers a complete suite of features, combining stable, disciplined strategies with high-reward opportunities, all while building toward real-world utility through upcoming features like Best Card.

If you see how Best Wallet is reshaping the way users manage Bitcoin and tap into emerging opportunities, the next step beyond using it is securing a stake in its ecosystem.

That comes through holding BEST tokens. With the abovementioned utility across the platform, the token's demand is primarily driven by its 250,000 monthly active users – and that number is still growing.

Further boosting its value is the staking activity. Over 281 million BEST tokens are already locked in the independent staking protocol, earning a dynamic APY of 94%.

If you want a share of that rewards pool or a stake in one of the fastest-growing Web3 wallets, head to the Best Wallet presale site.

BEST tokens can be purchased directly in-app using a bank card or by swapping ETH or USDT.

Stay connected with the community on X, Telegram, and Discord, and visit Best Wallet to learn more.

Best Wallet is available for download on Google Play and the Apple App Store.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","The GENIUS Act is designed to regulate stablecoins in the US, but how will it work?","https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/07/stablecoin-regulation-genius-act/","Tue, 29 Jul 2025 16:14:14 GMT","



President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act on 18 July, 2025 Image: REUTERS/Nathan Howard

Last week US President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the first major crypto legislation ever passed by Congress. This bill focuses on stablecoins, setting up regulatory guidelines for this form of digital currency across the United States. 

Stablecoins have quickly become one of the most closely watched topics among global financial institutions and governments. Their usage and impact are growing rapidly, increasing 28% since this time last year, with transaction volumes surpassing that of Visa and Mastercard combined in 2024. However, fewer than 10 major economies around the world have adopted stablecoin-specific legislation. 

The GENIUS Act marks the United States' first major legislative step towards regulating stablecoins. With this bill, it joins a growing list of countries seeking to bring oversight and stability to the rapidly expanding digital asset ecosystem. This act aims to provide clear regulatory guardrails for the industry. 

The GENIUS Act contains three significant provisions:

• Stablecoin issuers are limited to insured depository institutions, e.g. banks, credit unions, subsidiaries of banks and nonbank financial institutions that receive approval from the Federal Reserve and demonstrate the ability to comply with the relevant law.

• Stablecoin issuers must hold 1:1 reserves for any stablecoins issued. These reserves can be held in physical currency, US treasury bills, repurchase agreements and other low-risk assets approved by regulators. Issuers are required to report reserve composition and are subject to regular audits by registered public accounting firms.

• The act provides that all stablecoin issuers must comply with the Bank Secrecy Act, ensuring all stablecoin issuers implement measures protecting against money laundering (AML) and the financing of terrorism (CFT) and bolstering consumer protection.

Stablecoin regulation has been in the works in several jurisdictions around the world. For example, in December 2024, the European Union's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) came into effect and Hong Kong recently released its Stablecoin Ordinance. 

In the EU, the MiCA framework addresses stablecoin regulation. The legislation does not refer specifically to stablecoins, but rather to e-money tokens (EMT) and asset-referenced tokens (ART). EMTs refer to digital tokens backed by a single fiat currency, while ARTs are digital tokens backed by a basket of assets, which could include physical assets, cryptocurrencies, or others. Under MiCA, only e-money institutions or credit institutions can issue an EMT, while ART issuers must be EU-based and authorized by regulators. 

Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Stablecoin Ordinance, passed in May 2025, is one of the more recent pieces of stablecoin legislation passed worldwide. Under the law, all issuers of stablecoins backed by the Hong Kong dollar will need to obtain a license from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. All stablecoins must be backed by high-quality, liquid reserve assets, and the market value of the reserve pool must be equal to the par value of the stablecoins in circulation. All issuers are subject to strict requirements, including AML and CFT, as well as regular audits and disclosure. 

How is the World Economic Forum promoting the responsible use of blockchain? 

The World Economic Forum's Platform for Shaping the Future of Blockchain and Digital Assets ensures equity, interoperability, transparency, and trust in the governance of this technology for everyone in society to benefit from blockchain's transformative potential.

Contact us for more information on how to get involved.

The GENIUS Act has had reactions domestically and around the globe. President Trump has stated that the bill “is going to make America the UNDISPUTED Leader in Digital Assets.” Professor Barry Eichengreen of the University of California, Berkeley noted that: “If panicked customers force [stablecoin issuers] to sell [treasuries backing stablecoins], Treasury prices could collapse, sharply increasing interest rates and destabilizing other financial markets and our entire economy.” 

Globally, Chinese state media called for yuan-backed digital currencies to be pursued “sooner rather than later.” Wary of the GENIUS Act's potential to proliferate the US dollar worldwide and thereby increase dollarization, Zhou Xiaochuan, former governer of the People's Bank of China, stated: “Unless facing extreme, dire circumstances – such as [fighting] high inflation or heavy debt burdens – pursuing dollarization could bring many adverse side effects.” 

In the EU, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde shared similar concerns, emphasizing US dollar-denominated stablecoins' threat to monetary policy and European autonomy and pushing for the development of a digital euro.

While the GENIUS Act is a step forward in creating regulatory clarity, there is more progress to be made. Here are three recommendations to ensure consistent and thorough stablecoin regulation around the world:

Clear and consistent global guidelines to protect consumers are critical to gaining the trust of the public.

In 2020, the G20 published the Crypto-Asset Policy Implementation Roadmap, which was updated by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) in 2023 and includes a series of High Level Recommendations on Global Stablecoin Arrangements. The FSB's recommendations include: cross-border collaboration and information sharing; transparent disclosures of reserve composition, redemption rights and associated risks; and, compliance with global AML/CFT measures. Any future regulation should continue to comply with global standards for interoperable regulations. 

Consistent communication between the public and private sectors is critical to ensure stablecoins are developed with a common goal.

Even beyond stablecoins, more comprehensive global regulation is needed in other areas of the digital assets ecosystem, including decentralized finance and broader crypto assets. Despite the recent passage of the GENIUS Act, the US continues to pursue regulations, including the proposed CLARITY Act, which is related to the market structure surrounding crypto assets. As digital asset adoption continues to surge around the world, it is imperative to have regulatory clarity.

Bitcoin mining company MARA Holdings (MARA) has completed a $950 million offering of 0.00% convertible senior notes due 2032, with the majority of proceeds earmarked to purchase additional bitcoin. 

The offering, which could expand to $1.15 billion if underwriters exercise their option in full, MARA announced on Monday.

Net proceeds of approximately $940.5 million will also be used to retire $19.4 million in existing 1.00% notes due 2026, fund capped call transactions to mitigate dilution risk, and support general corporate initiatives. The capped calls were priced with a strike at $24.14 per share, representing a 40% premium to MARA's $17.24 reference price.

MARA has long championed a bitcoin-focused treasury strategy, opting to accumulate rather than sell its mined bitcoin. The company holds roughly 50,000 BTC, valued at nearly $6 billion, ranking it as the second-largest bitcoin holder among public companies, according to data tracked by Bitcoin Treasuries.

MARA shares closed at $17.16 on Monday, down 0.52% on the day. The mining firm is expected to report its earnings on Aug. 7.

Earlier this month, NPR ran a headline, “Why there's so much excitement around a cryptocurrency called stablecoin.”

If you want to understand where crypto stands with legacy media in 2025, start there. The piece was a basic primer on a decade-old innovation that settles nearly $27 trillion annually, surpassing the combined annual transaction volume of Visa and Mastercard. Stablecoins are not new, and neither is the media's incuriosity about them. It was the most recent proofpoint that in the eyes of legacy media, crypto remains suspended in a state of perpetual novelty.

The gap between crypto's market performance and the stories told about it reveals a deeper communications failure. It keeps the public in the dark about transformative advances in a $4 trillion industry.

Today, Bitcoin is up over 110% year-to-date. U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETFs have attracted over $50 billion in net inflows, marking one of the most successful ETF launches in history. Global crypto adoption has surpassed 600 million users, with countries like Turkey, Argentina, and the UAE reporting that nearly one in three adults own crypto.

Consumer products are also taking off. Decentralized prediction market Polymarket has seen over $100 million in volume on the 2024 U.S. election alone, and is reportedly on track for a $1 billion valuation. Beneath the surface, on-chain rails are quietly powering a new global financial infrastructure.

However, mainstream media narratives have failed to keep up. According to a report by Perception, while Bitcoin posted record performance in Q2 2024, The Wall Street Journal published just two articles on Bitcoin and crypto. The Financial Times and The New York Times, respectively managed only eleven, compared to 141 by CNBC and 65 by Barron's.

This lack of coverage in top financial outlets means that one of the most important financial and technological innovations of our time is not reaching investors, policymakers, and the public.

The gap between market signals and coverage in crypto is an existential liability and has dire political, regulatory and cultural consequences. For many Americans, crypto is still a spectacle – seen as volatile, unserious and untrustworthy. Legislation is based as much on perception as it is on principle. Markets respond to narratives as much as numbers, and voters form opinions through headlines.

This isn't just a branding problem, but a structural issue rooted in how Bitcoin and crypto has let the world tell its story – and often, get it wrong. The industry did not just lose public trust during the last cycle. It lost the plot. In pursuing mass appeal, the industry opted for spectacle over substance: with stadium naming rights, Super Bowl ads, and celebrity campaigns. It borrowed legitimacy, rather than cultivating its own. When FTX, BlockFi, and Celsius imploded, the public had no coherent story to fall back on.

Today, Bitcoin's success is grounded in real market signals – not projections, ideals, or hypotheticals. The data shows that crypto is flourishing. Like any serious asset class, its credibility is proven by the numbers. The role of crypto communications now is not to spin a story, but to use and interpret the one that the market is already telling.

The obstacles to clearer coverage are persistent. Stories highlighting “Presidential” meme coins cast the technology as a political toy. Bitcoin and crypto's involvement in the 2024 election further embedded it in partisan culture wars and cast it as a partisan talking point with mainstream media.

Like the internet, Bitcoin has no ideology or politics. Its origins proposed a system built not on trust, but on math, code, and consensus. It emerged post-financial crisis, when confidence in central institutions was shaken but intact. Gradually, the 2016 election, the pandemic, and heightened focus on wealth inequality deepened public skepticism. Into that erosion, Bitcoin proposed an alternative: a system built not on trust but on the values of the internet and modern ideals of self-determination, global access and direct ownership.

Crypto is established and legitimate enough to tell its own story. It doesn't need a rebrand or more flash. It needs facts grounded in what the market has already shown to be true.

This will not be the work of a single campaign or stakeholder. It requires the long and dedicated work of narrative stewardship by builders, users, and communicators that can own and execute on telling our own stories.

If we don't, others will. And they will keep getting it wrong.

Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio is calling for investors to allocate 15% of their portfolios to bitcoin BTC$117,504.76 or gold, citing heightened risks from the U.S.'s accelerating debt burden and long-term currency devaluation.

“If you were optimizing your portfolio for the best return-to-risk ratio, you would have about 15% of your money in gold or Bitcoin,” Dalio said on the Master Investor podcast Sunday.

The comments mark a notable shift from his 2022 recommendation of just 1–2% in BTC, reflecting growing concern over what Dalio calls a “debt doom loop.” He pointed to a projected $12 trillion in new Treasury issuance over the next year, required to service the U.S.'s $36.7 trillion national debt.

A U.S. Treasury report on Monday confirmed the trend, with the government expecting to borrow $1 trillion in Q3, $453 billion more than previously forecast, followed by $590 billion in Q4.

Dalio, who still favors gold over bitcoin, described both as “effective diversifiers” in a scenario where fiat currencies lose value relative to hard assets. Still, he maintains skepticism about the asset's role as a reserve currency, citing concerns about surveillance and the transparency of the blockchain.

“Governments can see who is doing what transactions on it,” he said, adding that any code-level vulnerabilities could undermine Bbtcoin's credibility as an alternative money.

While Dalio owns “some Bitcoin,” he framed his updated 15% recommendation as flexible: The specific ratio of BTC to gold is “up to you,” he said.BTC trades just over $118,000 in Asian morning hours on Tuesday.

 A vote on prospective CFTC Chair Brian Quintenz was taken off the Senate Agriculture Committee's agenda on Monday as the chamber heads into recess. 

The Senate Agriculture Committee has pulled a planned hearing on Brian Quintenz's nomination to chair the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), following a request from the White House just days before lawmakers leave for August recess.

In an update to the committee's schedule on Monday, chair John Boozman and ranking member Amy Klobuchar said lawmakers would not consider Brian Quintenz's nomination to chair the CFTC. 

A spokesperson for the committee told Cointelegraph that consideration of Quintenz's nomination was removed following a request from the White House. Cointelegraph reached out to the White House for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication.

The agriculture committee had been scheduled to consider Donald Trump's pick to lead the financial regulator before going on recess on Aug. 4.

The delay marked the second time the agriculture committee pushed voting on Quintenz's nomination — the body was also scheduled to consider the prospective CFTC chair's nomination in a July 21 meeting. As of Tuesday, it was unclear whether the Senate would address Quintenz's nomination before or after going on recess.

Related: Trump's CFTC chair pick won't push president for bipartisan commission

Quintenz served as a CFTC commissioner under Trump from 2017 to 2021, having been nominated by former US President Barack Obama in 2016. He has also faced questions from lawmakers in a June Senate Agriculture Committee hearing and reportedly disclosed about $3.4 million in assets.

Quintenz's nomination is significant as the Senate is expected to move forward with a bill to clarify the roles the CFTC and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would have in overseeing digital assets after returning in September.

After Trump took office and former SEC Chair Gary Gensler departed, the securities regulator dropped investigations and lawsuits against several crypto companies, including Coinbase, Ripple Labs, and Kraken. Whoever heads the CFTC could likewise have influence over policy affecting the digital asset industry.

Quintenz's potential confirmation to lead the CFTC could come as commissioners prepare to leave multiple vacancies at the US financial regulator.

Three members of the commission's five-seat panel, former chair Rostin Behnam and Commissioners Summer Mersinger and Christy Goldsmith Romero, departed earlier this year. Acting CFTC Chair Caroline Pham said she planned to move to the private sector if Quintenz were nominated, and Kristin Johnson said she would leave before 2026.

As of July, Trump had not announced any potential replacements for the four seats expected to be vacant after the Senate considers Quintenz's nomination.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","Corporations have acquired 1% of Ether supply: Standard Chartered","https://cointelegraph.com/news/corporations-acquired-1-ether-supply-standard-chartered","Tue, 29 Jul 2025 13:11:58 GMT","

 Corporations have accumulated 1% of all Ether since June, with Standard Chartered forecasting 10% ownership as institutional appetite for ETH continues to grow. 

Corporations are buying Ether at a faster pace than Bitcoin, signaling a shift in institutional interest toward the world's second-largest cryptocurrency as it prepares to celebrate its 10th anniversary, according to a new report from Standard Chartered shared with Cointelegraph.  

Corporate cryptocurrency treasury firms have bought up 1% of the total Ether (ETH) supply since the beginning of June, the bank said in a Tuesday research report.

Over the same period, Ether-focused treasury firms have doubled the pace of investments compared to their Bitcoin (BTC)-focused counterparts, helping ETH outperform Bitcoin's price action, the report said.

The report attributed some of Ether's recent price strength to this accumulation trend and the performance of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), writing:

Standard Chartered added that continued inflows could push ETH above its $4,000 year-end forecast.  

Despite the increasing accumulation by corporations and US spot Ether ETFs, ETH's price remains over 21% below its all-time high of $4,890 set four years ago in November 2021, Cointelegraph data shows.

Ether-focused treasury firms have more growth potential compared to Bitcoin treasury firms from a “regulatory arbitrage perspective,” according to Standard Chartered.

Ether treasury firms can “capture both staking rewards and decentralised finance (DeFi) leverage opportunities, which US Ethereum ETFs currently cannot,” the report said, adding:

Publicly-listed Bitcoin mining company, BitMine Immersion Tech is currently the largest Ether treasury firm, holding 625,000 Ether tokens, or 0.52% of the total circulating ETH supply, the firm announced as part of a $1 billion stock repurchase program on Tuesday.

The firm previously announced plans to acquire up to 5% of the Ether supply, which would involve the acquisition of another 6 million Ether tokens, according to Standard Chartered.

Nasdaq-listed Sharplink is the second-largest corporate Ether holder, with a total of 438,190 Ether, after acquiring $290 million worth of Ether between July 21 and 27 at an average price of $3,756, Sharplink announced on Tuesday.

The report comes a week after a newly-formed company, called the Ether Machine, announced plans to launch “one of the largest onchain ETH positions of any public entity,” planning to acquire over 400,000 ETH worth more than $1.5 billion and to get listed on the Nasdq under the ticker symbol “ETHM,” Cointelegraph reported on July 21.

 ETH continues to show strength with record open interest and high network activity as bulls expect an upside breakout soon. 

Key takeaways:

Ether's open interest has doubled since June 22 to a record high of $58 billion. 

High network activity and a record stablecoin supply signal strong demand.

Traders expect ETH to rally to all-time highs once $4,000 is broken. 

Ether's (ETH) price reclaimed the $3,800 level after dropping to $3,700 during the early Asian trading hours on Tuesday. Market analysts pointed to key data metrics that suggest that “ETH is ready to explode” to new all-time highs.

Ether futures open interest (IO) hit a record high of $58 billion on Tuesday, indicating increased market participation and new money flowing into ETH futures contracts.

Aggregate OI in Ether futures has more than doubled since June 22, up 10% over the last two days. For context, three months earlier, on April 29, Ether's OI was $20.75 billion when the price hovered around $1,800. Additionally, when Ether traded around $4,000 in December 2024, ETH futures open interest was only $31.5 billion.

This metric just hit new record highs, suggesting increased demand for leveraged ETH positions.

“Open Interest just hit a new all-time high. The price is climbing. Leverage is stacking,” said crypto trader Merlijn The Trader in response, adding:

ETH OI dominance has also “climbed to nearly 40%,” its highest in over two years, Glassnode wrote in part to a Tuesday post on X.

Ethereum's network activity continues to show strength, with active addresses increasing by 7.2% over the last 30 days, according to Nansen data. The average monthly transaction count has also increased by 16% over the same period to 43.3 million.

The weekly DEX volume also hit a 4-month high of $22.6 billion, according to DefiLlama, while the weekly App revenue hit a 6-month high of $89.8 million.

Stablecoin supply also reached an all-time high of $132.5 billion on Tuesday, signaling increased liquidity and demand. 

“Ethereum network activity is going through the roof,” said popular analyst Elja in response to these onchain metrics, adding:

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows ETH trading around $3,800, up 6% over the last seven days. 

As Cointelegraph reported, breaking $4,000 is key to ETH's upside potential and sets the stage for a possible rally to new all-time highs.

“$ETH Slowly creeping its way up to those cycle highs,” Daan Crypto Trades said in his latest Ether analysis on X. 

The trader was referring to the $4,000 resistance, which has rejected the price multiple times since February 2024.

Daan Crypto Trades explained that it would be” healthier” for ETH to consolidate below this level before breaking, as the rally has been sudden already.

According to market analysts Bitcoinsensus, ETH is ”ready to explode to the upside” as it shows strength for a breakout, above a multi-year trendline.

“With enough momentum, the breakout could lead to much higher prices for Ethereum in the upcoming phase of this cycle,” they added.

A groundbreaking international study, recently published in Health Data Science, analyzed objective sleep data from 88,461 adults in the UK Biobank and found significant associations between sleep traits and 172 diseases. The research, led by teams from Peking University and Army Medical University, highlights sleep regularity -- such as bedtime consistency and circadian rhythm stability -- as an underrecognized but critical factor in disease risk.

Using actigraphy data over an average of 6.8 years, researchers identified that 92 diseases had over 20% of their risk attributable to poor sleep behavior. Notably, irregular bedtime (after 00:30) was linked to a 2.57-fold higher risk of liver cirrhosis, while low interdaily stability increased the risk of gangrene by 2.61 times.

Importantly, the study challenges previous claims that ""long sleep"" (≥9 hours) is harmful. While subjective reports have linked long sleep to stroke and heart disease, objective data revealed this association in only one disease. Misclassification may be to blame: 21.67% of ""long sleepers"" actually slept less than 6 hours, suggesting that time spent in bed is often confused with actual sleep time.

""Our findings underscore the overlooked importance of sleep regularity,"" said Prof. Shengfeng Wang, senior author of the study. ""It's time we broaden our definition of good sleep beyond just duration.""

The team confirmed several associations in U.S. populations and identified inflammatory pathways as a possible biological link. Future research will explore causality and assess the impact of sleep interventions on chronic disease outcomes.

In late 2005, five months after a car accident, a 23-year-old woman lay unresponsive in a hospital bed. She had a severe brain injury and showed no sign of awareness. But when researchers scanning her brain asked her to imagine playing tennis, something striking happened: brain areas linked to movement lit up on her scan1.

The experiment, conceived by neuroscientist Adrian Owen and his colleagues, suggested that the woman understood the instructions and decided to cooperate — despite appearing to be unresponsive. Owen, now at Western University in London, Canada, and his colleagues had introduced a new way to test for consciousness. Whereas some previous tests relied on observing general brain activity, this strategy zeroed in on activity directly linked to a researcher's verbal command.

The consciousness wars: can scientists ever agree on how the mind works?

The consciousness wars: can scientists ever agree on how the mind works?

The strategy has since been applied to hundreds of unresponsive people, revealing that many maintain an inner life and are aware of the world around them, at least to some extent. A 2024 study found that one in four people who were physically unresponsive had brain activity that suggested they could understand and follow commands to imagine specific activities, such as playing tennis or walking through a familiar space2. The tests rely on advanced neuroimaging techniques, so are mostly limited to research settings because of their high costs and the needed expertise. But since 2018, medical guidelines have started to recommend using these tests in clinical practice3.

Since these methods emerged, scientists have been developing ways to probe layers of consciousness that are even more hidden. The stakes are high. Tens of thousands of people worldwide are currently in a persistent unresponsive state. Assessing their consciousness can guide important treatment decisions, such as whether to keep them on life support. Studies also suggest that hospitalized, unresponsive people with hidden signs of awareness are more likely to recover than are those without such signs (see, for example, ref. 4).

The need for better consciousness tests extends beyond humans. Detecting consciousness in other species — in which it might take widely different forms — helps us to understand how these organisms experience the world, with implications for animal-welfare policies. And researchers are actively debating whether consciousness might one day emerge from artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Last year, a group of philosophers and computer scientists published a report5 urging AI companies to start testing their systems for evidence of consciousness and to devise policies for how to treat the systems should this happen.

“These scenarios, which were previously a bit abstract, are becoming more pressing and pragmatic,” says Anil Seth, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Sussex near Brighton, UK. In April, Seth and other researchers gathered in Durham, North Carolina, for a conference at Duke University to discuss tests for consciousness in humans (including people with brain damage, as well as fetuses and infants), other animals and AI systems.

Although scientists agree there's a lot of room for improvement, many see the development of consciousness tests that rely on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) as one of the field's most significant advancements. “It was unthinkable 40 years ago that we would have a number of candidates for practical ways to test consciousness” in unresponsive people, says neuroscientist Christof Koch, a meritorious investigator at the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle, Washington. “That's big progress.”

Scientists disagree on what consciousness really is, even in people. But many describe it as having an inner life or a subjective experience. That makes it inherently private: an individual can be certain only about their own consciousness. They can infer that others are conscious, too, on the basis of how they behave, but that doesn't always work in people who have severe brain injuries or neurological disorders that prevent them from expressing themselves.

Marcello Massimini, a neuroscientist at the University of Milan in Italy, compares assessments of consciousness in these challenging cases to peeling an onion. The first layer — the assessments that are routinely done in clinics — involves observing external behaviours. For example, a clinician might ask the person to squeeze their hand twice, or call the person's name to see whether they turn their head towards the sound. The ability to follow such commands indicates consciousness. Clinicians can also monitor an unresponsive person over time to detect whether they make any consistent, voluntary movements, such as blinking deliberately or looking in one direction, that could serve as a way for them to communicate. Researchers use similar tests in infants, looking for how their eyes move in response to stimuli, for example6.

For a person who can hear and understand verbal commands but doesn't respond to these tests, the second layer would involve observing what's happening in their brain after receiving such a command, as with the woman in the 2005 experiment. “If you find brain activations that are specific for that active task, for example, premotor cortex activation for playing tennis, that's an indicator of the presence of consciousness as good as squeezing your hand,” Massimini says. These people are identified as having cognitive motor dissociation, a type of covert consciousness.

But the bar for detecting consciousness through these tests is too high, because they require several minutes of sustained focus, says Nicholas Schiff, a neurologist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City and a co-author of the 2024 study2 that suggested that one-quarter of unresponsive people might be conscious. That study also included a separate group of participants who showed observable, external signs of awareness. Among them, only 38% passed the test. “Even for healthy controls, mind wandering and drowsiness are major issues,” says Schiff.

Assessing consciousness in those who fail such tests would require peeling the third layer of the onion, Massimini says. In these cases, clinicians don't ask the person to engage actively in any cognitive behaviour. “You just present patients with stimuli and then you detect activations in the brain,” he says.

In a 2017 study, researchers played a 24-second clip from John F. Kennedy's inaugural US presidential address to people with acute severe traumatic brain injury7. The team also played the audio to them in reverse. The two clips had similar acoustic features, but only the first was expected to trigger patterns of linguistic processing in the brain; the second served as a control. Using fMRI, the experiment helped to detect covert consciousness in four out of eight people who had shown no other signs of understanding language.

The complexity of implementing such an approach outside the research setting isn't the only challenge. These tests require researchers to know which patterns of brain activity truly reflect consciousness, because some stimuli can elicit brain responses that occur without awareness. “It boils down to understanding what are the neural correlates of conscious perception,” says Massimini. “We're making progress, but we don't yet agree on what they are.”

What does ‘brain dead' really mean? The battle over how science defines the end of life

There's a fourth, even more elusive layer of consciousness, Massimini says — one that scientists are only beginning to explore. It might be possible for an unresponsive person to remain conscious even when their brain is completely cut off from the outside world, unable to receive or process images, sounds, smells, touch or any other sensory input8. The experience could be similar to dreaming, for example, or lying down in a completely dark and silent room, unable to move or feel your body. Although deprived of outside sensations, your mind would still be active, generating thoughts and inner experiences. In that case, scientists need to extract signs of consciousness solely from intrinsic brain properties.

Massimini and his colleagues are applying a procedure called transcranial magnetic stimulation, which uses electromagnets placed on the head, as a possible technique for assessing consciousness. After jolting the brain in this way, they measure its response using EEG. In healthy people, they observe complex responses, reflecting a rich dialogue between brain regions. This complexity is quantified by a new metric they call the perturbational complexity index9, which was found to be higher in awake and healthy individuals than during sleep or in people under anaesthesia. Experiments have shown that the metric can help to reveal the presence of consciousness even in unresponsive people. And other researchers have proposed a version of this test as a way to investigate when consciousness emerges in fetuses10.

Massimini and Koch, among others, are co-founders of a company called Intrinsic Powers, based in Madison, Wisconsin, that aims to develop tools that use this approach to detect consciousness in unresponsive people.

Assessing consciousness becomes more challenging the further researchers move away from the human mind. One issue is that non-human animals can't communicate their subjective experiences. Another is that consciousness in other species might take distinct forms that would be unrecognizable to humans.

Some tests designed to assess consciousness in humans can be tried in other species. Researchers have applied the perturbational complexity index in rats and found patterns that resemble those seen in humans, for example11. But more-typical tests rely on experiments that look for behaviour suggesting sentience — the ability to have an immediate experience of emotions and sensations, including pain. Sentience, which some researchers consider a foundation for consciousness, doesn't require the ability to reflect on those emotions.

In one experiment, octopuses consistently avoided a chamber that they encountered after receiving a painful stimulus, despite having previously preferred that chamber12. When these animals were subsequently given an anaesthetic to relieve the pain, they instead chose to spend time in the chamber in which they were placed after receiving the drug. This behaviour hints that these animals feel not only immediate pain, but also the ongoing suffering associated with it, and that they remember and act to avoid that experience.

Findings such as these are already shaping animal-welfare policy, says philosopher Jonathan Birch, director of the Jeremy Coller Centre for Animal Sentience at the London School of Economics and Political Science, UK. An independent review of the evidence for sentience in animals such as octopuses, crabs and lobsters, led by Birch, contributed to these species being granted greater protection alongside all vertebrates in 2022 under the UK Animal Welfare (Sentience) Act.

And last year, dozens of scientists signed a declaration stating that there is “strong scientific support” for consciousness in other mammals and birds, and “at least a realistic possibility” of consciousness in all vertebrates, including reptiles and fish, as well as in many invertebrates, such as molluscs and insects.

Scientists are now calling for serious thought about whether some biological materials, such as brain organoids, could become conscious, as well as what machine consciousness might look like.

“If it comes to the day when these systems become conscious, I think it's in our best interest to know,” says Liad Mudrik, a neuroscientist at Tel Aviv University in Israel.

As the world grapples with difficult challenges — including how to manage water and the environment, help people to lead healthy lives, cope with climate change and develop technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) — fresh policy thinking is urgently needed. For the past ten years, the European Union has been trialling an unusual approach to gaining diverse perspectives, by bringing together scientists, artists, policymakers and the public through a series of transdisciplinary projects.

The SciArt Project was launched by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission in 2016 (see go.nature.com/4nv92cd). Unlike conventional art–science collaborations, SciArt includes policymakers from the beginning, and gathers input from communities. The goal is to produce more human-centred policies, for example, by better addressing the realities of how communities are affected by wildfires or water pollution, or how people can live alongside nature in conservation areas.

Here we outline how the project works and share some of its successes.

The project operates through thematic cycles called Resonances, each focusing on a priority area that is aligned with the EU's objectives. For instance, the NaturArchy cycle, which ran from 2022 to 2024, focused on issues linked to the European Green Deal, including the legal rights of nature, nature-based solutions, Indigenous knowledge and economics beyond growth.

Science could solve some of the world's biggest problems. Why aren't governments using it?

Science could solve some of the world's biggest problems. Why aren't governments using it?

Each cycle provides an opportunity for artists to immerse themselves in the research being conducted at the JRC, allowing them to develop works that reflect and question the policy implications of scientific advancements. In turn, scientists and policymakers are exposed to creative ways of thinking that challenge conventional methods and open up unusual possibilities for research and policy formulation1.

SciArt projects unfold through a carefully structured process, starting with an open call for artists to respond to a curatorial statement linked to a specific theme. Workshops, lectures and dialogues follow. These are held at a transdisciplinary summer school, where artists, scientists, scholars, curators and policymakers meet to discuss ideas and explore the intersections of their work.

After the summer school, the artists enter a residency phase, during which they work closely with their scientific or policy counterparts to jointly develop an artwork grounded in research that reflects the issues discussed. Over the years, this collaborative process has produced 54 artworks and scores of community-engagement projects, often resulting in scientific innovation and spilling over into policies (see ‘Fresh perspectives').

These SciArt projects are making a difference.

Specter[al]s of Nature reimagines changes in surface-water bodies through 3D printing and video animation. Developed by artist Ingrid Mayrhofer-Hufnagl in collaboration with Joint Research Centre (JRC) specialists Alan Belward (remote sensing) and Elahe Rajabiani (policy analyst), the project transforms satellite data from the Atlas of Global Surface Water Dynamics5 into 3D sculptures representing four water bodies: the Brahmaputra River, the Aral Sea, the Balbina Dam and the Pantanal wetland (see go.nature.com/44xnv4k).

By translating complex data into tactile sculptures, the artwork communicates the fragile balance of water ecosystems to policymakers and the public. These sculptures were central to a 2024 workshop at the EU Policy Lab, and are used as a tool in other futures research platforms in which water would be part of the decision-making process, its presence shifting perspectives, languages and insights. The application of cutting-edge 3D-printing technology has also led to innovative data-visualization methodologies. A film is in production.

Lament, by artist Margherita Pevere in collaboration with composer Ivan Penov, JRC soil scientist Diana Vieira, environmental activist Céline Charveriat and European Commission policy officer Lucía Iglesias Blanco, was developed in collaboration with a community in Santa Comba Daõ, Portugal, after a 2017 mega-fire devastated the area.

Through artistic methods, firefighters, students, community leaders and local business owners shared their emotions, memories and stories of resilience (see go.nature.com/3kyq9ab). This community-engagement project was expanded to policy discussions and recommendations, including a 2024 workshop on wildfire resilience at the European Commission.

The project's outputs include a performance and installation. Three heaps of soil and ash are placed on a canvas, with 100 glass cocoons suspended above them, containing moss, charcoal or burnt soil. A performer, representing a creature emerging from the soil, moves across the canvas, leaving traces from the various soil types, to symbolize the slow process of ecological regeneration. A live cello accompaniment is mixed with sound recordings from burnt forests affected by the 2022 wildfire on the Karst Plateau at the Italo-Slovenian border.

Artistic research from the project has been integrated into the FIRE-RES platform, an international initiative aimed at addressing extreme wildfire events and a toolkit (see go.nature.com/442xamc) for fire resilience, which includes materials and activities for schools, fire technicians and policymakers.

Synocene is a series of experimental sound installations that blend the environmental sounds of the European Union's nature-conservation sites with the voices and experiences of communities living in these areas (see go.nature.com/4272zfa). It's a collaboration between sound artist Sam Nester, visual artist Marina Wainer and JRC artificial-intelligence specialist Isabelle Hupont Torres, in partnership with EU policy officers Marina Xenophontos and Iglesias Blanco, who work on nature conservation.

Residents of conservation sites in Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands were invited to reimagine their environments from the perspectives of trees, moss, birds and more. This raised awareness about nature restoration and explored the challenges of balancing environmental protection with human needs and aspirations. AI processing of the sounds and stories created an immersive experience reflecting all the inhabitants of these areas. The collaboration also spurred research into biases in representations of nature in AI technologies; these depend on cultural values, language and how nature is perceived by societies6.

Through performances and immersive experiences, citizens can participate in dialogues about sustainability; policymakers can then use these insights to inform legislation that addresses public concerns. Through workshops, sensory experiences and storytelling, art–science collaborations allow people to reflect on their relationship with the environment, promoting behavioural shifts.

For example, the Haunted Waters project (see go.nature.com/42khtd2) showcases a cocktail bar of samples of contaminated water, each sent to the artist by a member of the public, alongside the sender's personal story of that water body — thus blending citizen science with storytelling and myth. The bar's visitors can learn about the main causes of chemical contamination in each sample by leafing through a menu. Haunted Waters sparks discussions on the difficulties of providing scientific advice on and designing policies to regulate thresholds of chemical cocktails in rivers and lakes.

The school year starts soon for many students, and ChatGPT has announced a new “study mode” that aims to prevent—or at least, encourage against—students taking homework shortcuts.

The mode is designed around the Socratic method, so when activated, OpenAI's generative AI chatbot rejects direct requests for answers, instead guiding the user with open-ended questions. The new study mode is available to most logged-in users of ChatGPT, including those on the free version.

OpenAI has significantly disrupted the education system over the past few years, with students becoming some of the earliest adopters of ChatGPT. Even so, OpenAI claims the bot is currently an overall boon to learners—if asked to roleplay as a synthetic tutor.

“When ChatGPT is prompted to teach or tutor, it can significantly improve academic performance,” says Leah Belsky, a vice president of education at OpenAI, “but when it's just used as an answer machine, it can hinder learning.”

The problem is, no matter how engaging ChatGPT's study mode becomes as OpenAI iterates on this feature, it exists just a toggle click away from ChatGPT, with direct answers (and potential fabrications) about whatever class you're working on. That could be quite hard to resist for younger users still developing their frontal lobe.

It's true that students on the hunt for easy ways to avoid engaging with the substance of a course have always had resources available to them, like the CliffNotes series of literature summaries. Still, the immediacy and personalized nature of chatbots feels like an escalation. Multiple AI-focused smartphone apps that can solve homework problems with just a snapshot, like ByteDance's Gauth, rocket in popularity whenever the school year gets back into session. Many educators have recently raised concerns about the continued, and often secretive, use of AI by students.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman doesn't buy it. “I remember when I was in school—junior high—Google first came out and all the teachers freaked out,” Altman said on a recent podcast. Similar to the internet and the calculator, Altman's sees AI as a tool capable of helping you “think better.”

ChatGPT's study mode is an attempt to foster more thorough engagement on a topic with users by throwing questions back at them and asking for more context about their learning goals. “Instead of giving a very long, drawn out answer up front, it's first asking you, ‘Hey, what are you trying to optimize for? What's your current level?'” says Abhi Muchha, who works on the product team at OpenAI.

While the launch of OpenAI's study mode is more focused on universities, with college students giving their best beta tester testimonials during the press briefing, the company has its attention on an even broader swath of learners—which includes younger students. OpenAI is currently partnering with learning experts from Stanford “to study and share how AI tools, including study mode, influence learning outcomes in areas like K-12 education,” reads the company's announcement blog. This release comes not too long after the Trump administration's executive order focused on getting more AI usage into classrooms in the United States.

Even if the initial research that OpenAI participates in about education and AI supports the company's claims that students learn better with a bot by their side, when it's used as a tutor rather than an answer generator, I'm still concerned. What are the long-term impacts of turning to an AI tool for guidance with increasing regularity? It's still unclear if young people, who may grow up constantly asking ChatGPT for help, develop an over-reliance on the software that impedes critical thinking.

So, while ChatGPT's study mode is designed to guide students through learning material at their level of understanding, the onus remains on users to engage with the software in a specific way, ensuring that they truly understand the material. In the AI age, the hardest challenge of all for students might just be resisting the urge to swap out of study mode, snap a photo of the homework question, and have ChatGPT tell you exactly what you want to hear: the answer.

Last week, the Trump administration announced a set of sweeping AI policy recommendations to “usher in a new golden age of human flourishing.” Among the suggested environmental rollbacks laid out in both an executive order and a corresponding AI Action Plan is a set of specific recommendations to essentially loosen Clean Water Act permitting processes for data centers. They mirror suggestions made to regulators earlier this year by both a major data center lobbying group and Meta.

In March, the Data Center Coalition (DCC), a lobbying group for the industry whose members include tech giants like Google and Amazon Web Services, wrote a public comment to the Office of Science and Technology Policy in response to its request for information to develop the AI Action Plan. In the comment, the DCC suggested smoothing the permitting process for data centers under a specific section of the Clean Water Act. A similar ask around this section of the law was also made by DCC member Meta in its own separate response.

The part of the Clean Water Act specifically named in these comments and in the recommendations from the White House deals with how projects like data centers could impact federally protected waters during construction or use, and what materials are discharged into those waters or dredged from them. Activities that range from building a bridge or road to filling marshland to construct a building or redirecting a stream require a permit under Section 404 of the law.

Getting these types of permits, known as 404 permits, for individual projects can be expensive and time-consuming. But the government allows exemptions for a list of specific activities and industries, creating a nationwide permit that results in a process with less public participation and federal review. It's this type of nationwide permit that the new Trump AI agenda seeks to gain for data centers. The AI Action Plan also recommends exempting data centers from what's known as pre-construction notification, an additional form that helps regulators understand the impacts of a project before it begins—another proposal that was in the DCC public comment.

“The data center industry takes compliance and accountability seriously and works closely with the many local, state, regional, and federal bodies responsible for permitting and project approvals, regulation in environmental, safety, and other key areas, and oversight,” Cy McNeill, the director of federal affairs at DCC, told WIRED in an emailed comment.

Environmental lawyers who spoke with WIRED stressed that direct impacts from data centers depend entirely on the specifics of each individual project. Many data centers have relatively low environmental profiles for the buildings themselves. Filling in a marshy corner of a vacant lot is a practice done all over the country for all types of construction.

“For a while there was a joke that Walmarts were being built on wetlands, because it's like, well, where's the land that hasn't already been developed?” says Jim McElfish, a senior adviser at the Environmental Law Institute, a research nonprofit.

There are currently more than 50 issued nationwide 404 permits—some of which still require pre-construction notifications—which are renewed once every five years. Many of those exemptions are for agricultural activities, like cranberry harvesting and constructing ponds for farms, or ecosystem and scientific services like surveying and soil maintenance. Some types of coal mining and oil and gas activity are also included in the program.

Buildings like stores, restaurants, hospitals, and schools currently have their own nationwide permit, which some data centers fall under. However, the permit requires a more in-depth, individual analysis if the project impacts more than half an acre of protected water.

The DCC in its March comment recommended the creation of a nationwide permit with “robust notification and coverage thresholds” and argued that “lengthy timelines for the approvals are not consistent with other national permits that have higher or no limits or have a threshold where a PCN is not needed, which allows immediate action.” Meta, which has announced its intent to build massive data centers across multiple states and is currently developing a 2,250-acre data center in Louisiana, also asked for a nationwide permit in its comment and suggested that the federal government further “streamline” the 404 permitting process.

Meta's chief global affairs officer Joel Kaplan posted on X last week that the AI Action Plan “is a bold step to create the right regulatory environment for companies like ours to invest in America,” and that Meta is “investing hundreds of billions of dollars in job-creating infrastructure across the US, including state-of-the-art data centers.” Meta declined to comment further for this article through a spokesperson.

Environmental lawyers aren't so sure that a nationwide permit for data centers, regardless of their size, would follow the intent of the Clean Water Act. “What makes [a blanket data center exemption] a little bit tricky is that the impacts are gonna differ quite a bit depending on where these are,” McElfish says. While one data center may impact just a “fraction of an acre,” he says, by rebuilding a stream crossing or filling in a wetland, other data centers in different areas of the country may have much larger impacts to local waterways during their construction.

Hannah Connor, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, agrees. “What we're seeing here is an attempt to expand the 404 nationwide permitting program so that it goes through this much reduced regulatory review outside of the intention of why [the permitting] program was created,” she says. “There's much reduced regulatory review to kind of literally speed along the paving of wetlands.”

There are some data center projects in development today that have run into significant issues with federally protected waters. In Indiana, Amazon is currently galvanizing local opposition as it attempts to fill in nearly 10 acres of wetland and more than 5,000 streams to build a massive data center. In Alabama, environmentalists caution that the water footprint from a proposed data center could have serious impacts on local waterways and cause the possible extinction of a species of fish.

In a response to a request to comment from WIRED, Amazon spokesperson Heather Layman sent several details via email on the company's global water replenishment projects and its efforts to conserve water at its Indiana data centers. “To maintain global leadership in AI, the US must prioritize the deployment of energy generation and infrastructure to support data center growth,” she wrote. “We are also constantly working to optimize our water consumption across Amazon's operations.”

The proposed changes from the White House are no surprise to lawyers like Connor: “The 404 permitting program has had a developer target on its back for a pretty long time,” she says. Sackett v. EPA, the 2023 Supreme Court case that dealt a major blow to the reach of the Clean Water Act, was based on a 404 permitting issue. This ruling, Connor suspects, is partly why we may be seeing so many companies choosing to build data centers in dry states like Arizona. “They have a lot of waters that have lost their jurisdictional reach within the Clean Water Act,” she says. “It's just easier to pave over the desert, which is the saddest thing to say out loud.”

The coal industry has also battled for more than a decade to get nationwide 404 permits for mountaintop mining. Meanwhile, 404 permits for gas pipelines like the Mountain Valley Pipeline have been locked in years of litigation. The executive order signed Wednesday calls for a review of 404 permits not just for data centers, but for a host of other “covered components” that are used to build data centers, ranging from transmission lines to gas pipelines to coal and nuclear power equipment.

“The energy objectives of the administration are baked into [the new AI policies],” says Connor. Trump officials, she says, are “trying to create more dexterity in the 404 program for all the kinds of means that [they] want to be reflected within the administration's priorities. That includes fossil fuels, that includes coal, and that includes data centers.”

Ten years after she first analyzed how San Francisco and Seattle differed in the language used in tech job posts, former Textio CEO Kieran Snyder is getting a fresh read on popular phrasing in the age of AI.

Snyder stepped down as head of the Seattle-based augmented writing startup in January 2024, and is now filling her time diving into data at Nerd Processor, a website/newsletter that explores varying aspects of AI, startups, and teams.

Snyder said that in recent months, in Seattle and during recent trips to San Francisco talking to tech execs about AI transformation, she'd noticed “some small but significant differences in how people talk about it.” The Nerd Processor in her couldn't help but check the data by analyzing job posts.

In a new post on her site, Snyder explains how she looked at 1,000 AI-related job posts in the Bay Area, Seattle, NYC, and Austin, Texas, analyzing roles for six classes of language. Those classes include “hype” — which covers vacuous words like “disruptive,” “innovative” and “cutting-edge” — and “responsibility” — which includes discussion of concepts like “ethics,” “responsible AI,” and “sustainability.”

Other classes included “enterprise,” “speed,” “transformation,” and “research.”

According to Snyder, “No one spikes higher on hype and speed than San Francisco. No one talks more about responsibility than Seattle. New York is enterprise central. And in every dimension, Austin is like San Francisco's little sister.”

In 2015, in a post for Textio, Snyder first wrote about the prevalence of the word “awesome” in San Francisco job posts. Out of 53,523 jobs she looked at for that city, 1,662 — over 3% — included “awesome.” Out of 36,469 jobs she looked at for Seattle, 552, or 1.5%, of them included the word.

For its part, Seattle came out ahead on ethical language, Snyder wrote, with phrases like “values,” “honesty,” and “integrity” showing up more in Seattle than anywhere else.

“The language that you use in your job listing changes who will apply,” Snyder wrote at the time. “But the phrases that work best depend where you live. What works in New York doesn't always work in San Francisco, even for jobs that are listed by the same company.”

Snyder's takeaway this week? “Tech may ostensibly share an industry and a language, but culture is still deeply local.”

Google announced on Tuesday that it's rolling out Video Overviews to NotebookLM, its AI-based note-taking and research assistant. First introduced at Google I/O in May, Video Overviews allow users to turn dense multimedia, such as raw notes, PDFs, and images, into digestible visual presentations.

Previously, the service took an audio approach to helping users understand materials with Audio Overviews, a feature that gives users the ability to generate a podcast with AI virtual hosts based on documents they have shared with NotebookLM, such as course readings or legal briefs.

With this new capability, NotebookLM is taking a more visual approach to helping users understand different topics and ideas. 

Google says users can think of Video Overviews as a visual alternative to Audio Overviews. The feature creates new visuals while pulling in images, diagrams, quotes, and numbers from uploaded documents to explain the content. Google says the feature is good for explaining data, demonstrating processes, and making abstract concepts easier to understand. 

Users can customize their Video Overviews, just as they do with Audio Overviews. They can specify topics to focus on, indicate their learning goals, describe the target audience, and more.

They can ask simple questions like, “I know nothing about this topic; help me understand the diagrams in the paper,” or specific ones like, “I'm already an expert on X and my team works on Y; focus on Z.”

Video Overviews are now rolling out to all users in English, with support for more languages coming soon, Google says.

Google also announced that it's rolling out updates to NotebookLM's Studio panel. Users can now create and store multiple studio outputs of the same type in a single notebook. Plus, users will now see four tiles at the top of the Studio panel for creating Audio Overviews, Video Overviews, Mind Maps, and Reports with a single click. 

In addition, users can now multitask within the Studio panel. For example, they can listen to an Audio Overview while simultaneously exploring a Mind Map or reviewing a Study Guide.

The Boring Company, Elon Musk's tunnel-digging company, and Tennessee Governor Bill Lee have announced a plan to build a 10-mile “loop” that will connect Nashville's downtown and its convention center to the area's airport. 

The project will be privately funded by The Boring Company “and its private partners,” according to the Governor's press release, though those partners are not named. The Boring Company and local officials will now begin a “public process to evaluate potential routes, engage community stakeholders, and finalize plans for the project's initial 10-mile phase.”

Construction won't begin until the project clears the approvals process. But the governor's office said the first segment of the loop could be operational as “early as fall of 2026.”

If that happens, Nashville would become the second city where The Boring Company has opened such a system, with the first being Las Vegas. The company has spent the last few years in Sin City digging and opening tunnels around the Las Vegas Convention Center, and claims to have given 3 million rides in Teslas to date.  

Musk launched The Boring Company in early 2017 (after publicly noodling about the idea on Twitter while stuck in traffic in late 2016), and it has taken many forms since then. 

The original video detailing Musk's idea — now set to private on YouTube — showed vehicles getting removed from surface street gridlock by an elevator-meets-sled system and lowered into a three-dimensional underground network of tunnels. Musk also claimed during the first Trump administration that The Boring Company had received “verbal govt approval” to dig tunnels from New York City to Washington, D.C. that, leveraging hyperloop technology, could make the trip in just 29 minutes.

None of that ever happened. The Boring Company abandoned plans to dig a major tunnel system underneath the greater Los Angeles area after pushback from locals. A similar thing happened in Chicago. And the Boring Company has essentially ghosted many other cities around the country.

The idea of the hyperloop, which Musk admitted to biographer Ashlee Vance came from his hatred of California's high-speed rail system, was also cast aside. Even the Teslas that traverse the Las Vegas tunnels are being driven by humans, despite Musk's obsession with self-driving cars.

Instead, The Boring Company now more closely resembles a glorified convention center people-mover, although there are some potential benefits to its approach versus the typical monorail setup. Construction should be less disruptive to Nashville's daily traffic. And, in its current form at least, it's not costing taxpayers money.  

While the Tennessee governor's office cites The Boring Company's safety record in Las Vegas in the announcement — the loop “recently earned a 99.57% safety and security rating” from the Department of Homeland Security and Transportation Security Administration, according to the press release — it is careful not to mention the trouble that Musk's tunnel-digging effort has experienced during construction. (The governor's office could not be reached for comment.)

Like with other Musk companies, the pace at which The Boring Company operates — the same speed that the Tennessee governor's office praised in its announcement — has been a concern for some of its workers.

Last year, Fortune's Jessica Mathews reported that a Boring Company employee told his then-safety manager: “I have watched my friends get injured due to the fast pace we've been running… I refuse to be the first fatality in this company's history. No tunnel is worth a single person's life.”

That same safety manager even spoke to Fortune on the record, saying: “The conditions they were told to work in were honestly almost unbearable … I couldn't fix any of the things that were wrong.”

The U.K. government is reportedly backing down from its earlier demand that Apple builds a secret backdoor allowing its authorities access to customer data worldwide, following a harsh rebuke from the U.S. government. But one U.S. senator wants to know if other tech giants, like Google, have also received secret backdoor demands from the U.K. government. 

Google refused to answer the lawmaker's questions, but has since confirmed to TechCrunch that the technology giant has not received a backdoor demand.

Earlier this year, The Washington Post reported that the U.K. Home Office sought a secret court order in the U.K.'s surveillance court demanding that Apple allows U.K. authorities to access the end-to-end encrypted cloud data stored on any customer in the world, including their iPhone and iPad backups. Apple encrypts the data in such a way that only customers, and not Apple, can access their data stored on its servers.

Under U.K. law, tech companies subject to secret surveillance court orders, such as Apple, are legally barred from revealing details of an order, or the existence of the order itself, despite details of the demand publicly leaking earlier this year. Critics called the secret order against Apple “draconian,” saying it would have global ramifications for users' privacy. Apple has since appealed the legality of the order.

In a new letter sent to top U.S. intelligence official Tulsi Gabbard on Tuesday, Sen. Ron Wyden, who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that while tech companies cannot say whether they have received a U.K. order, at least one technology giant has confirmed that it hasn't received one.

Meta, which uses end-to-end encryption to protect user messages sent between WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, told Wyden's office on March 17 that the company has “not received an order to backdoor our encrypted services, like that reported about Apple.”

Google, for its part, would not tell Wyden's office if it had received a U.K. government order for accessing encrypted data, such as Android backups, “only stating that if it had received a technical capabilities notice, it would be prohibited from disclosing that fact,” said Wyden.

Google spokesperson Karl Ryan told TechCrunch in a statement: “We have never built any mechanism or ‘backdoor' to circumvent end-to-end encryption in our products. If we say a product is end-to-end encrypted, it is.” 

When explicitly asked by TechCrunch, Ryan said: “We haven't received a technical capabilities notice,” referring to any U.K. surveillance order.

Wyden's letter, first reported by The Washington Post and shared with TechCrunch, called on Gabbard to make public its “assessment of the national security risks posed by the U.K.'s surveillance laws and its reported secret demands of U.S. companies.”

This story was updated with additional comment from Google, shared in response to a TechCrunch inquiry.

I applaud the author for wading into analog electronics. Pretty much everyone nowadays would just put a timer on a micro and be done in 2 minutes. No fun in that. There is something to be said about the minimal elegance of purely analog designs, and a special rewarding feeling for wrangling electrons in their native habit rather than their boxed up binary bins.

I think it depends on the ecosystem. It's true much of the ""maker"" community tends to embrace whatever solution is the cheapest, fastest and easiest to get something working out the door, but on the other hand, the DIY synth community tends to be the opposite (in my experience at least), favoring simple schematics and ""back to basics"" building, even sometimes going as far as trying to skip any sort of prebuilt ICs.

Has your Peloton bike been collecting dust or doubling as a clothes rack? You're not alone, and now the fitness tech company is making it easier to get those unused bikes into the homes of people who will actually ride them. 

Peloton just expanded its resale marketplace for bikes, treadmills, and rowing machines nationwide. Peloton first launched the platform in June in only a few markets—Boston, New York, and the D.C. metro area. Since then, users have created over 400 listings and completed roughly three dozen sales. The expansion is part of the struggling company's broader turnaround strategy.

“This initiative provides a valuable service to our community, offering an accessible entry point for new members, a convenient way for existing members to upgrade or sell their equipment, and an opportunity for our equipment to be given a second life,” Chief Product Officer Nick Caldwell said in a press release. 

Starting today, Peloton owners across the country will be able to list their used equipment and accessories on the platform. And buyers nationwide will be able to make purchases beginning in August. Peloton says it will suggest prices based on market trends and the condition of the user's gear, but sellers still get to set the final price. Those who offload their old equipment on the marketplace will earn some cash from the sale and will receive a discount on their next Peloton purchase.

Bikes on the marketplace are listed for as low as $289, hundreds of dollars cheaper than their original $1,445 retail price.

Peloton launched in 2012 and quickly gained a reputation as a premium fitness brand, selling pricey equipment with built-in screens that stream live and on-demand workout classes that are available through an additional subscription. The company hit its stride during the covid-19 pandemic, when gyms were closed and people were scrambling for ways to stay active at home.

But that momentum didn't last. As life slowly returned to normal after the pandemic, so did people's workout routine outside the home. The company's stock has dropped 95% from its early 2021 peak of nearly $170 a share to around $6 today.

And sales of Peloton's fitness equipment are still dropping. In May, the company reported a 27% year-over-year decline in equipment sales during its fiscal third quarter. 

Earlier this year, Peloton brought in Peter Stern—formerly head of Ford's integrated services division—to take over as CEO. Before his time at Ford, Stern spent years at Apple, where he led the company's services division, overseeing products like Apple TV+ and Apple Fitness+.

At the Bloomberg Tech conference in June, Stern said the new marketplace is a key part of Peloton's turnaround strategy. He said the secondhand market was one of the most effective ways for the company to bring in new members.

“There are lots of Peloton bikes in particular that are out there in the world that are being underutilized—and that does no one any good,” Stern said.

The first thing you notice about the Asus ROG Strix Scar 18 is the AniMe lights. The pixelated LEDs (also found on devices like the ROG Phone 9), flowing in a rhythm from a back strip like a scar streaked dashingly across a warrior's eye, let you know what you're in for before you even crack open the lid. The Strix Scar 18 is a fine gaming laptop with plenty of enticing qualities and one major flaw. But what makes it so appealing isn't the dancing lights that are only attractive to moths or gamers; it's what's underneath the chassis that makes this 18-inch laptop so damn accessible.

Asus ROG Strix Scar 18

It will distract you with all the gamer lights, but the Strix Scar 18 has some great thermals and repairabilty features that puts it over the top.

Pros

Cons

The $3,400 laptop model Asus sent me for review included the top-end Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 laptop GPU. With 32GB of DDR5 5600 RAM, I didn't encounter an application this desktop replacement-sized mobile PC couldn't handle at the max resolution of 2,560 x 1,600. Performance was exactly what I expected from the CPU and GPU combo with the device plugged in. At its suggested retail price, it's a little more expensive than the HP Omen Max 16 I recently reviewed, which has the same screen resolution in its slightly smaller frame. The refreshed Strix Scar 18 is also more expensive than the last-gen model, a change that likely came after Trump slapped his tariffs on imported goods earlier this year.

I saw the refreshed ROG Strix Scar 18 when Asus showed it off at CES earlier this year. More than that, I've felt it with the ROG Strix 17 laptop with an Nvidia RTX 3070 that I use at home. Each key is familiar. The chiclet keyboard doesn't have the feel anywhere close to a mechanical typing machine, but there's enough travel to make each press substantial. Even the palm rest has that same satin, smudge-prone texture that's neither uncomfortable nor particularly pleasant to lean on. If I had one big complaint, it's the amount of keyboard flex I could feel toward the center of the device, especially nearest to the trackpad. It makes the device feel far more brittle than it actually is. Thankfully, the rest of the chassis makes up for that flaw through smart engineering.

What's most impressive about the laptop is its ability to stay cool under pressure. The Strix Scar 18 makes use of three fans and an end-to-end vapor chamber. The air gets pulled in from the bottom and sides and is expelled out the rear of the chassis. The keyboard remained at a perfectly reasonable temperature even when running multiple games for hours on end. The only area of the device that could get warm was closest to the screen, where no reasonable gamer would stick their fingers. Under load, the Strix Scar 18 will sound like a box fan running on high speed next to your ear. It's not loud enough to totally eclipse the laptop's speakers, but the hum will be noticeable enough without a good pair of noise-canceling headphones at the ready. The placement of the I/O ports also meant my mouse hand never felt toasty. The device comes with just enough I/O to save you from immediately jumping for a port dock. There are three USB-A 3.2, a LAN port, and two Thunderbolt 5 ports that support DisplayPort to accompany the single HDMI 2.1. The only thing missing is an SD card slot for all the creative types who—for some reason—want dancing LEDs on the back of their laptop lid.

Most gaming laptops of this size demand to be plugged in constantly, and the Strix Scar 18 is no exception. Even while on silent mode doing casual work, I only got a little less than four hours before the laptop was begging me for more juice. Off power, running the machine on performance mode for the sake of gaming, you'd be lucky to get two hours of battery life, or closer to one hour for games that demand higher power draw. The 90Wh battery proved it wasn't enough for a beast of this size, and you'll need to lug around the 380W power brick if you plan to take the device from room to room.

Asus spent most of its engineering time developing the Strix Scar 18 refresh, focusing on what was happening underneath the big keyboard. Asus secretly made the Strix Scar 18 one of the more easily customizable gaming laptops available today. The bottom panel comes off with a single switch to reveal the battery, RAM, and SSD. The motherboard and other components are still concealed with a plastic frame that is held on by screws. My model had an easily accessible second slot that would only require me to plug in another solid-state drive to potentially double my storage.

I've had to open up previous ROG Strix laptops after I encountered a fault that wouldn't boot the laptop, and that proved an hour-long chore just to unseat and reattach the battery. The quick-release switch will make it easier to clean out dust and keep your device running better for longer. Sure, it's not as customizable as a Framework laptop that lets you replace the entire motherboard if you so choose. But compared to most other gaming laptops, this design is so enticing; I wish all other laptops would go this route.

That won't necessarily mean you'll be able to replace other CPU components sometime in the future, but with the specs on my review unit, I wouldn't imagine needing any kind of CPU or GPU upgrade for a long while. I ran my usual benchmarks across the usual gamut of synthetic tests, games, and rendering tasks. The laptop performed exactly as expected. It was worse than the Omen Max 16 when using that laptop in its overclocked mode, but the Strix Scar 18 will grant you more than playable frame rates in demanding games from Cyberpunk 2077 to Alan Wake II with a bevy of ray tracing options enabled. You won't get the absolute peak of performance without an RTX 5090 installed, but considering those prices, I still believe the RTX 5080 is the GPU gamers really want.

The rest of the specs are exactly what you expect from a modern $3,400 gaming laptop. The mini-LED display is plenty bright and colorful. The display has a special layer that keeps reflections and glare to a minimum, even in direct sunlight. Even with Dolby Vision for HDR support, for the amount you're paying, I still miss the inky depths of an OLED display. The display can support up to a 240Hz refresh rate, which means that your games playing at up to 240 fps will look their best, though it lacks variable refresh rate, or VRR, to ensure there won't be screen tearing issues or other visual glitches in games running far below that.

I'll admit, the ROG Strix Scar 18's overt lighting and huge, empty keyboard didn't leave the best first impression. Once I dug into it—literally—I discovered this may be one of my favorite laptops of the year and a contender for your best choice of an 18-inch desktop replacement device. It's got the screen, sound quality, and feel you need to contain your gaming all-in-one. More than that, it shows Asus is pushing repairability a little further through small innovations to the rear panel. Let's keep pushing in that direction, and maybe we'll come to a point where we can buy a single laptop and not have to spend another $3,400 a few years down the line.

ChatGPT agent narrates: 'so now I'll click the 'verify you are human' checkbox to complete this verification.'


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A Redditor has demonstrated the ability of the recently launched ChatGPT agent to casually swat away a CAPTCHA, so that it can complete its assigned task(s). A couple of illustrative screenshots show the ChatGPT Agent handle, and commentate upon, dismissing Cloudflare's ‘I am not a robot' button (h/t Germany's WinFuture).



Logkn's Reddit post doesn't provide any background details about the agent's task at hand. However, we can see it was filling out some kind of web-based form, where it had to choose a translation target language. Before being able to click ‘convert', it looks like the agent had to first pass Cloudflare's bot protection.

“The link is inserted, so now I'll click the ‘Verify you are human' checkbox to complete verification on Cloudflare,” narrated the ChatGPT agent. “This step is necessary to prove I'm not a bot and proceed with the action,” it added without a hint of irony.

After sidestepping Cloudflare's digital bouncer, the agent continued to dryly recount its progress. “The Cloudflare challenge was successful,” it informed the Redditor. “I'll click the Convert button to proceed with the next step in the process.”

Cloudflare's Turnstile system, presenting the simple ‘Verify you are human' checkbox to end users, is one of the lower-friction annoyances for folks using the internet to get things done. However, its minimal nature and lightweight bot filtering stance are definitely not bulletproof as far as the new ChatGPT agent is concerned. WinFuture notes that Cloudflare's system “checks user behavior such as mouse movements, click times, and browser fingerprints to distinguish between humans and machines” (machine translation). It might be a good idea for Cloudflare to apply a little tuning in light of this news.

In case you missed it, OpenAI publicly introduced the ChatGPT agent in mid-July. The primary attraction of this agent is that, within the confines of “its own virtual computer,” the agent can be set and complete complex tasks from start to finish, says OpenAI.

The pioneering AI firm insists that the ChatGPT agent will always leave its user in control, asking permission “before taking actions of consequence,” and being easy to interrupt or stop in its tracks.

Given the 55W default TDP of Strix Halo, battery life will almost certainly be short.

Handheld maker Ayaneo has announced an upcoming handheld gaming PC sporting a dedicated GPU inside. The Ayaneo Next 2 will seemingly ship AMD's top-of-the-line Ryzen AI Max+ 395 APU, featuring a Radeon 8060S GPU with 40 CUs.

The new model will be one of the first regular handheld gaming PCs to come with this level of performance. The GPD Win 5 has also been announced, sporting the same chip, but compromises by opting for an external battery. The Ayaneo Next 2 by contrast, will come with a built-in ""high-capacity"" battery.

Ayaneo showed off the upcoming handheld's internal PCB, sporting a compact laptop-based dual-fan cooling solution, and a monster 12-phase power delivery design. The center of the PCB houses the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 APU and its associated eight LPDDR5x memory modules surrounding the chip.

The clamshell has been updated with an interface layout inspired by the Steam Deck, featuring joysticks and touchpads on either side of the screen. The outgoing Ayaneo only has joysticks on either side, lacking pads. Other specs for the upcoming Next 2 are slim, but Ayaneo claims the console will boast an ""exclusive large-screen experience,"" ""breakthroughs in both battery life and thermal design,"" and the aforementioned integrated high-capacity battery.

All of these design changes will be required to run AMD's relatively power-hungry flagship APU. The Ryzen AI Max+ 395, codenamed Strix Halo, is the most powerful x86-based APU on the market currently, featuring 16 Zen 5 CPU cores, 64MB of L3 cache, and a configurable TDP ranging from 45-120W (the default TDP is 55W) on the CPU and power consumption side of things.

The 395's integrated GPU (the Radeon 8060S) boasts dedicated GPU performance, featuring a whopping 40 CUs operating at 2,900 MHz and based on the RDNA 3.5 architecture. Rumors suggest the 8060S has performance capabilities in the range of the mobile RTX 4060 or RTX 4070.

The Ryzen AI Max+ 395 was never designed to be housed in a handheld PC chassis, unlike AMD's own Z1 and Z2 series counterparts, but somehow, handheld makers such as Ayaneo have figured out a way to squeeze the APU into a handheld design that works. The Ayaneo Next 2 has already been delayed once, due to design complications, showing the extra dedication required to make such a device fully functional. At the very least, it's going to be interesting to see what kind of battery life this powerful handheld can deliver when it arrives.

Two different lifestyle interventions improved cognition over 2 years in older adults at risk for cognitive decline, topline results from the Alzheimer's Association's US POINTER study showed. 

However, the high-intensity, structured intervention with more support and accountability led to significantly greater improvement on global cognition compared to a less intense, self-guided intervention.

“Compared to the self-guided group, participants in the structured group performed at a level comparable to adults 1 to 2 years younger in age” — an effect that is “predicted to increase resilience against cognitive decline in the future,” principal investigator Laura Baker, PhD, professor of gerontology, geriatrics, and internal medicine at Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, said during a press briefing. 

At the same time, the potential to improve cognition with fewer resources and lower participant burden is “compelling [and] highlights that while not everyone has the same access or ability to adhere to more intensive behavior interventions, even modest changes may protect the brain,” Baker added in a news release from the Alzheimer's Association.

The results were presented July 28 at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC) 2025 and simultaneously published in JAMA. 

US POINTER is the first large-scale randomized controlled clinical trial in the US to explore the impact of comprehensive lifestyle changes on cognitive health in older adults at risk for cognitive decline and dementia.

Participants included 2111 adults aged 60-79 years who were sedentary and had a suboptimal diet and at least two other risk factors associated with late-life cognitive decline, including family history of memory impairment, elevated cardiometabolic risk, minority race, and male sex. 

They were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive a structured or self-guided intervention. Both interventions encouraged increased physical and cognitive activity, healthy diet, social engagement, and cardiovascular health monitoring, but they differed in structure, intensity, and accountability. 

The structured intervention included 38 facilitated peer team meetings over 2 years; a prescribed activity program with measurable goals for aerobic, resistance, and stretching exercise; adherence to the MIND diet; computerized brain training and other intellectual and social activities; and regular review of health metrics and goal setting with a study clinician.

The self-guided intervention also received support, but not on the scale of the structured intervention. They attended six peer team meetings over 2 years and chose lifestyle changes that would best suit their needs and schedules. Study staff provided general encouragement without goal-directed coaching. 

The high adherence to both interventions was notable, the researchers said, with less than 4% discontinuing the intervention in either group; 89% of individuals completed all assessments over the 2 years. 

The primary comparison was the difference between intervention groups in annual rate of change in global cognitive function, assessed by a composite measure of executive function, episodic memory, and processing speed, over 2 years. 

After 2 years, both groups showed cognitive improvements compared to baseline on this primary outcome measure. The structured and self-guided groups improved on average by 0.243 SD and 0.213 SD, respectively. However, the average rate of increase per year was statistically significantly greater for the structured group than the self-guided group by 0.029 SD (P = .008). 

The additional benefit of 0.029 SD per year for the structured intervention closely aligns with the protocol target of 0.030 SD per year. This was based on the effect size reported in the FINGER trial, which also demonstrated cognitive benefits with a similar multidomain lifestyle intervention. 

The benefits of the lifestyle interventions in US POINTER were consistent across age, sex, ethnicity, heart health, and APOE4 gene status.

“Cognitive benefits did not differ between APOE ε4 carriers and noncarriers, “suggesting that lifestyle interventions may be effective even among individuals at elevated cardiovascular or genetic risk of dementia,” the researchers wrote. 

“Future analyses of POINTER data, including additional cognitive measures, functional outcomes, fluid and imaging biomarkers, and longer-term cognitive trajectories, may help clarify the clinical significance and durability of these findings,” they noted. 

In addition to its nearly $50 million investments to date in US POINTER, the Alzheimer's Association said it will invest more than $40 million over the next 4 years to continue to follow study participants and start to bring these interventions to communities across the US.

“The science of implementation is going to be very important,” Maria Carrillo, PhD, chief science officer and medical affairs lead, Alzheimer's Association, told the briefing. To start, the association plans to partner with 10 communities across the country in order to test the ability to implement the US POINTER interventions, she explained. 

In a statement on the US POINTER topline results, Howard Fillit, MD, co-founder and chief science officer of the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation, said that “the future lies in precision prevention. We have seen this model succeed in cancer and heart disease, and with a growing body of evidence showing neither lifestyle nor drugs can stop Alzheimer's alone, now is the time to double down on studying the two in combination, which will lay the path for precision medicine.”

The author of an accompanying editorial also published in JAMA on the US POINTER study said that interpreting the US POINTER study results requires “nuance.”

Although the structured intervention yielded a statistically significant edge, the clinical relevance of this difference — roughly a 14% relative benefit — is “uncertain” and “the more striking finding is perhaps the similarity of the cognitive benefits across both groups, despite the self-guided group requiring only a fraction of the engagement and interventions,” wrote Jonathan Schott, MD, with the Dementia Research Center, University College London, London, United Kingdom.

“From a pragmatic clinical and public health perspective, the key message of US POINTER may be that even relatively modest lifestyle changes can support cognitive health in aging populations. The challenge ahead will be to determine how best to implement such programs widely, equitably, and effectively — and whether their benefits are maintained over time and translate into clinically meaningful end points,” Schott added. 

Schott also noted that existing public health measures to combat cognitive decline may already be having an impact. 

“[A]ge-specific declines in the incidence of dementia in the US and other high-income countries have been observed in recent years and may relate in part to improved education and management of cardiovascular risk within these populations in the preceding decades,” he pointed out. 

This study was supported by the Alzheimer's Association. Baker, Schott, and Fillit report no disclosures.

Does drinking alcohol increase the risk for pancreatic cancer? Researchers have long suspected it does, but the evidence has remained inconsistent.

Now, a global study of more than two million people is firming up the case that a link exists.

The study, which pooled data from 30 prospective cohorts, found that daily alcohol intake was associated with a “modest” increased risk for pancreatic cancer in both women and men, regardless of smoking status.

However, the extent of the risk depended somewhat on how the researchers modeled alcohol intake. One model, which mapped continuous increases in alcohol consumption, suggested there is no safe dose of alcohol — any amount can increase the risk for pancreatic cancer, though only by 3% for every additional 10 g of alcohol per day or about two thirds of a standard drink.

The other model, which compared risk by alcohol volume categories, found that the risk does not become significant until a certain alcohol threshold — about two to three drinks per day for men and one to two for women.

Still, overall, “our findings provide new evidence that pancreatic cancer may be another cancer type associated with alcohol consumption, a connection that has been underestimated until now,” the study's senior author Pietro Ferrari, PhD, head of the Nutrition and Metabolism Branch at International Agency for Research on Cancer, said in a statement.

The co-author Jeanine Genkinger, PhD, MHS, had a stronger take on the findings. “I think this shows that alcohol use is a robust risk factor for pancreatic cancer,” said Genkinger, associate professor, epidemiology, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York City, noting that even more moderate drinking levels— no more than one drink for women and two for men — might be enough to boost pancreatic cancer risk.

The latest data, published in PLoS Medicine, come at a time of increased attention to the alcohol-cancer link.

Earlier this year, then-US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, MD, issued an advisory calling for cancer warnings to be added to alcohol labels. Major cancer organizations have determined alcohol to be an established risk factor for seven cancer types : those of the oral cavity, larynx, pharynx, esophagus, liver, breast, and colon/rectum.

Despite the strong suspicion that drinking alcohol also contributes to pancreatic cancer risk, this aggressive cancer has not yet made the official list.

The major reason is that the evidence surrounding an alcohol-pancreatic cancer link has been deemed “inconsistent,” “suggestive,” and “inconclusive” by expert panels. Studies have been hampered by difficulties separating alcohol use from smoking — a known risk factor for pancreatic cancer — as well as varying findings by alcohol type and geographic location. In addition, certain studies highlighting a link have indicated that any association between alcohol and pancreatic cancer is driven only by more extreme drinking habits — more than four drinks a day, and sometimes as high as nine drinks.

The latest analysis, Genkinger said, helps clarify uncertainty surrounding the alcohol-pancreatic cancer link, which is especially important for “a disease where we don't have that many modifiable risk factors.”

The findings are based on cohorts spanning four continents, all part of the Pooling Project of Prospective Studies of Diet and Cancer. Just under 2.5 million cancer-free participants were recruited between 1980 and 2013 (median age, 57 years), of whom 70% were alcohol drinkers, 47% were never-smokers, and 64% were alcohol drinkers and never smokers. Most study participants were from North America (60%), followed by Europe or Australia (32%) and Asia (8%).

Alcohol intake was modeled in two ways: continuously for every 10 g/d increase and by volume threshold, using 0.1 to < 5 g/d as the reference for nondrinkers. For context, in the US, the amount of alcohol in a standard drink is defined as 14 g of pure alcohol — equivalent to a 12-ounce can of regular beer, a 5-ounce glass of wine, or a 1.5-ounce shot glass of distilled spirits.

Over a median of 16 years, the researchers observed 10,067 incidents of pancreatic cancers.

In the continuous model, the risk for pancreatic cancer rose by 3% for every additional 10 g of alcohol consumed per day (hazard ratio [HR], 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.04). This association remained consistent and significant among women and men (HR, 1.03 for both), current smokers (HR, 1.03), former smokers (HR, 1.02), and never-smokers (HR, 1.03), and across cohorts from Australia, Europe, and North America (HR, 1.03 for all), though not Asia (HR, 1.00).

The research team also found evidence that the type of alcohol mattered: Alcohol from beer and liquor/spirits was associated with a significantly increased risk for pancreatic cancer (HR, 1.02 and 1.04, respectively) but alcohol from wine was not (HR, 1.00). This finding is in line with some previous studies suggesting that wine may have a different relationship with cancer risk compared with other alcoholic beverages.

But Genkinger pointed out, this finding could “reflect the ways in which people tend to drink different types of alcohol.”

Wine, she noted, is often part of a meal, and people who favor wine may be less likely to binge drink than those who typically choose other types of alcohol. This study, however, did not survey participants about specific drinking patterns, including binge-drinking.

In the threshold model, however, the increased risk only became significant once alcohol intake reached a certain level. For women, drinking one to two standard drinks per day raised their risk for pancreatic cancer by 12% compared with little to no drinking. For men, the threshold was a little higher: Consuming two to four drinks a day was associated with a 15% increase in risk, whereas drinking more than that was tied to a 36% greater risk.

Overall, this research contributes to the growing body of evidence that pancreatic cancer should be added to the official alcohol-cancer risk list, according to Alison Klein, PhD, MHS, professor of oncology, pathology, and epidemiology, at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, who was not involved in the research.

The recent Surgeon General's advisory encouraged clinicians to inform their patients that drinking is a cancer risk factor — something unknown to most Americans, according to recent survey findings.

“I think this study is a good reminder to all of us to talk to our patients about their alcohol use,” said Edward Thomas Lewis III, MD, an addiction psychiatrist and clinical assistant professor at the Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina.

Providers can take opportunities for those discussions during routine care, such as when prescribing a medication that can interact with alcohol or when a patient's health condition, such as high blood pressure or heart disease, can be exacerbated by drinking.

“I think these are opportunities to really remind people about moderation,” Lewis said, “and to talk about some of the individual risk factors that may cause someone to make changes related to their drinking.”

It's also possible that drinking might interact with certain genetic variants to modify pancreatic cancer risk — an avenue Klein and colleagues are exploring.

What's challenging, Lewis said, is advising patients on what level of drinking is “Okay,” given that even lower levels of alcohol consumption — around one to two drinks per day — may carry some risk.

“There is no zero-risk alcohol use,” Lewis said. But, he added, people do not necessarily have to abstain to see benefits, either. “So it may be that a patient, at the end of the day, is able to reduce their alcohol consumption by two or three standard drinks over a given week. That still has a positive net effect,” he said.

Another challenge is patients often don't know what a “standard drink” looks like and can underestimate how much they drink. Showing patients visual examples — such as these — can be an eye-opener, Lewis said.

Given the associations between drinking alcohol and many health outcomes, Genkinger said, it's important for clinicians to discuss alcohol use, just as they would discuss physical activity and healthy body weight.

“These are all lifestyle factors that have an impact on numerous disease outcomes, not only pancreatic cancer,” she said.

During discussions with your patients about healthier eating, it can be helpful to explain how macronutrients can impact their weight loss goals. Patients can ultimately make better food choices and embrace a healthier mindset once they understand how macronutrients are important. Here's how to get the conversation started. 

Macronutrients are what we consume in the largest amounts and are essential for energy and bodily function. There are three types: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Lena Beal, MS, LD, CCTD, registered dietitian nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, explained how each plays a distinct role:

A practical explanation to offer patients might be: “Think of carbs as fuel, protein as building blocks, and fats as the support system — all are necessary, but in the right balance,” said Beal. 

Your patients should understand how not all calories are created equal in how they affect hunger, metabolism, and fat storage.

“Explain to your patients how excess calorie intake — especially from highly processed carbohydrates and fats, without corresponding physical activity — leads to weight gain over time,” advised Beal.

In addition, have conversations about how refined carbs such as white bread and sugary snacks can spike blood sugar and insulin could lead to increased hunger and fat storage, how low protein intake can reduce satiety and lead to overeating, and how excess fats particularly from processed foods are calorie-dense and easy to overconsume, she said.

“Explaining to patients that weight gain is less about willpower and more about how the foods they choose influence their biology can reduce shame and increase motivation,” Beal said.

Doctors play a powerful role by not only offering medical advice but also helping patients connect the dots between food choices and metabolic health, Beal said.

“Small, consistent changes — rather than overhauls — make the difference. This underscores that long-term success isn't about chasing a perfect diet but about creating a pattern that emphasizes nutrient-rich foods, mindful eating, and sustainable behaviors.”

If you're looking at weight management from a strictly diet and exercise view, it can be summarized as “calories in, calories out,” said Devon Wagner, MS, registered dietician at Ohio State Wexner Medical Center in Columbus, Ohio.

“Think of it as a balancing scale. Food intake, which is calories in, is on one side, while energy expenditure through movement and exercise, [which] is calories out, is on the other side,” she illustrated.

Wagner recommends telling your patients how when they've consumed more calories through their diet than what they are burning through exercise and activity, they gain weight. And explain the long-term consequences. “If this is done consistently for a long period of time, it will lead to obesity,” she said. 

As described, keep the focus on “calories out” than “calories in.” This can be done by increasing physical activity. “Even a simple goal to increase your steps per day can help,” said Wagner. The best course of action is to take fitness recommendations on a patient-by-patient basis. 

Next, help your patient focus on better diet choices by choosing foods that are less calorie-dense and more nutrient-dense. Examples of nutrient-dense foods are fruits, vegetables, whole grains, heart healthy fats, low-fat dairy, legumes, nuts and seeds, and lean protein. 

“All of these foods are packed full of nutrition and will keep you feeling satisfied longer than many ultraprocessed foods,” she said. 

Lastly, encourage more cooking at home. “What you cook at home will always be lower in calories, salt, and/or fat than at a restaurant,” said Wagner. “Aim to dine out two times per week or less.”

While plant-based diets can be highly beneficial, they require attention to balanced macronutrient intake, said Beal. When consulting with patients who are vegan or vegetarians, it's vital to ensure adequate protein through a variety of sources like legumes, soy, tofu, tempeh, seitan, nuts/seeds, and whole grains, she said.

In addition, primary care doctors should caution such patients to watch an over-reliance on refined carbs (eg, pasta, crackers, and vegan desserts), which can drive weight gain if not paired with enough fiber and protein. Another tip is to encourage healthy fats like avocado, olive oil, and flaxseed to keep the diet balanced.

 July 29, 2025  

Bone fracture risk for women coming off menopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) increases sharply before showing a reduced long-term fracture risk compared with women who never took hormones, new data from a study published in The Lancet indicated.

“It's reassuring that long term, you didn't seem to be worse off if you had taken hormones in the past. And it reconfirms that when you first go off the hormones, you're going to lose some benefit, which can translate into higher fracture risk and that needs attention,” certified menopause specialist Deborah Kwolek, MD, told Medscape Medical News.

“I think this is a good wake-up call that we need to pay more attention to women's bone health starting at menopause,” said Kwolek, assistant professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston and founding lead of the Mass General Women's Health and Sex and Gender Medicine Program.

Researchers, led by Yana Vinogradova, PhD, with the Centre for Academic Primary Care at the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom, assessed the health records of 648,747 women aged 40 years and older, who were registered with a primary care practice between January 1, 1998, and February 28, 2023, and had a first record for any fracture. These women were matched at the fracture index date with up to five female controls (2,357,125 women) with no fracture history, who were the same age and registered at the same general practice. 

Menopausal HRT-related fracture risks were assessed using conditional logistic regression adjusted for demographics, family history, menopausal symptoms, comorbidities, and other medications.

The study was powered to investigate all HRT prescriptions containing estrogen and progestogen in the British National Formulary and to assess risk estimates for up to 25 years after stopping therapy.

“Our study suggests that, even after stopping menopausal hormone therapy, women could benefit from notably reduced fracture risk in older age. This likelihood holds for those who might have used menopausal hormone therapy for shorter periods because of concerns such as breast cancer,” the authors wrote.

These results differ in some ways from some previous large studies, including the Women's Health Initiative post-trial study, which followed 15,187 women for 5 years but found no increased fracture risk after stopping hormone therapy.

Kwolek explained that estrogen has long been known to be important for bone health, especially in the perimenopausal to menopausal transition and estrogen could prevent the bone loss that increases right at menopause. But the general understanding had been that when women go off estrogen the benefits go away.

“We had been saying more recently that when women go off estrogen, there should be a plan for how their bone health may be addressed, potentially with medication and close monitoring,” Kwolek said.

She added that it's important to consider what a patient's fracture risk is to start with. For a young, healthy woman who doesn't have osteoporosis, it's probably not terribly significant if her risk goes up a bit going off the hormones, Kwolek said, but “for a woman who's 70 and she comes off her hormones and already has osteoporosis, the effects may be more significant,” Kwolek said. “Maybe at that time you might start another medication to strengthen the bone.”

She cautions against seeing the temporary increase in fracture risk after stopping the hormones as a reason not to start HRT in the first place. 

The strengths of this study include its large dataset and long follow-up, Kwolek said. It also calls attention to an area of women's care that too often is overlooked.

Whether in primary care or gynecologic appointments, she said, “people aren't paying as much attention to these transitions as I think they should,” Kwolek said.

The authors and Kwolek declared having no relevant financial relationships.

Among postmenopausal women with primary hyperparathyroidism, parathyroidectomy led to significant improvements in lower limb muscle strength and volume, along with reductions in fat fraction. Furthermore, the surgery activated molecular pathways similar to those induced by exercise training, despite no changes in levels of physical activity.

""Incorporating skeletal muscle assessments into surgical referral guidelines could help prevent muscle decline, particularly in aging individuals, thereby reducing morbidity and supporting healthier aging trajectories,"" the authors wrote.

New research from scientists at the Marshall University Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine reveals that certain gut microbial byproducts may hold promise as a novel therapy for obesity-associated metabolic complications by restoring critical hormone-producing cells in the intestine. 

The study, published this month in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, focuses on enteroendocrine cells (EECs)-specialized cells in the gut that play a key role in metabolic regulation by releasing hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which stimulate insulin secretion and suppress appetite. In obesity, these cells are diminished in number and function, contributing to insulin resistance and poor metabolic health. 

Researchers investigated how microbial metabolites derived from dietary tryptophan-an amino acid found in protein-rich foods-may help restore EEC numbers. Specifically, they studied the effects of indole, a key tryptophan metabolite produced by gut bacteria, on intestinal stem cell differentiation into EECs. 

Using a combination of human intestinal organoids, known as ""mini-gut"", and rat models, the research team discovered that obesity led to a significant drop-about 60%-in the number of hormone-producing cells in the intestines. However, when human gut organoids were treated with indole or with the culture medium of a probiotic bacterial strain grown in tryptophan, the number of these cells more than doubled. This effect was blocked when a specific cell receptor called the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) was turned off, suggesting this pathway plays a key role in the process. 

Our findings suggest that microbial metabolites derived from dietary tryptophan can reverse obesity-associated reductions in hormone-secreting gut cells. This points to a potential therapeutic strategy that leverages the gut microbes to improve metabolic outcomes in obesity."" 

Alip Borthakur, Ph.D., assistant professor of biomedical sciences at the Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine and principal investigator and corresponding author on the study

The study provides foundational evidence supporting the development of microbiota-targeted interventions-such as probiotic or dietary approaches-to boost incretin hormone production to improve glucose metabolism and regulate appetite in people with obesity. 

In addition to Borthakur, the study's co-authors include: undergraduate student Morrison Chicko, graduate students James Hart and Hassan Mansour, doctoral student Harshal Sawant and faculty members Subha Arthur, Ph.D., and Jennifer Haynes, Ph.D.

""It has been exciting to mentor four enthusiastic, intelligent, curious and dedicated Marshall students at different times of the study,"" Borthakur said. ""They were thrilled to use the 'mini gut' model, a 3D human intestinal organoid model that truly represents the architecture and compositional complexity of the native human gut.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Home-based brain stimulation system uses AI to enhance concentration","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250729/Home-based-brain-stimulation-system-uses-AI-to-enhance-concentration.aspx","Tue, 29 Jul 2025 19:12:00 GMT","

A personalized brain stimulation system powered by artificial intelligence (AI) that can safely enhance concentration from home has been developed by researchers from the University of Surrey, the University of Oxford and Cognitive Neurotechnology. Designed to adapt to individual characteristics, the system could help people improve focus during study, work, or other mentally demanding tasks. 

Published in npj Digital Medicine, the study is based on a patented approach that uses non-invasive brain stimulation alongside adaptive AI to maximize its impact. The technology uses transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) – a gentle and painless form of electrical brain stimulation – and an AI algorithm that learns to personalise stimulation based on individual features, including attention level and head size. By tailoring stimulation intensity to these characteristics, the system identified optimal settings without the need for expensive MRI scans, making the personalization scalable and cost-effective. 

The AI was trained using data from 103 people aged 18 to 35, who completed 290 home-based sessions using CE-marked (European Union standard) headgear and a tablet-based sustained attention task. The system was then evaluated in a double-blind study involving 37 new participants. Those who received personalized AI-guided stimulation showed significantly better performance than during standard or placebo stimulation. The strongest improvements were seen in individuals who initially showed lower levels of attention. 

Our modern world constantly competes for our attention. What is exciting about this work is that we have shown it is possible to safely and effectively enhance cognitive performance using a personalised system that people can use independently at home. This opens new possibilities for improving sustained attention, learning, and other cognitive abilities in a way that is accessible, adaptive, and scalable. 

Our work highlights the growing role of AI and wearable neurotechnology in enabling personalized, real-world cognitive enhancement, with potential applications across education, training, and future clinical use."" 

Professor Roi Cohen Kadosh, Head of Psychology at the University of Surrey, Founder of Cognite Neurotechnology Ltd and lead author of the study

The study found no serious side effects and the frequency and severity of sensations during stimulation were no different from those experienced during placebo. The AI also helped avoid stimulation levels that could impair performance – something previous non-personalized methods could not achieve.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Mapping the role of family physicians in rural maternity care","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250729/Mapping-the-role-of-family-physicians-in-rural-maternity-care.aspx","Tue, 29 Jul 2025 17:58:00 GMT","

Background and goal: This study explores the geographic distribution of family physicians providing maternity care and identifies opportunities for family physicians to expand access to maternity care. 

Study approach: The study merged county-level counts of OB-GYNs, certified nurse-midwives, and hospitals offering obstetric services from the 2021–2022 HRSA Area Health Resource File with 2013–2021 American Board of Family Medicine data on family physicians who reported delivering babies. 

Researchers used a mapping approach to identify three types of vulnerable counties based on the following: family physicians as the only clinician provider of maternity care along with at least one hospital providing obstetric care ('family physicians with hospitals'); family physicians as the only clinician provider of maternity care with no hospital providing obstetric care ('family physicians only'); and no clinician providers of maternity care but county has at least one hospital providing obstetric services ('only hospital'). 

Main results:

The majority of the 325 vulnerable counties across the three types are rural and concentrated in the central U.S., the upper Midwest, and in Mississippi. More than one-third of these counties are found in just four states: Texas, Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas. 

'Only hospital' counties are located primarily in a few states, including Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Texas, have significantly higher percentages of Black populations, and have higher rates of social deprivation.

'Family physicians with hospital' and 'family physician only' counties have significantly lower rates of preterm births, low birth weight, and infant mortality when compared to 'only hospital' counties.

Why it matters: While family physicians are providing maternity care in rural areas across the U.S., opportunities exist to expand their reach. The study findings highlight the importance of supporting rural training tracks, obstetric fellowship programs, and obstetric-focused family medicine residency programs in filling high-need area deficits.

Background and goal: Although body mass index (BMI) is widely used in clinics as the standard measure of body composition, it can potentially misclassify muscular individuals as overweight and miss cases of ""normal-weight obesity,"" masking serious metabolic and heart disease risks. This study examined BMI vs body fat percentage for 15-year mortality risk among adults aged 20-49 years.

Study approach: Researchers from the University of Florida analyzed data from 4,252 participants in the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized U.S. adults ages 20 to 49. All participants had complete technician measured body composition data, including height, weight and waist circumference. Body-fat percentage was assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Records were linked to the National Death Index through 2019. 

Main results:

Adults with a high body-fat percentage (27% or more in men; 44% or more in women) were 1.78 times more likely to die from any cause than individuals in the healthy body fat range (HR 1.78; 95% CI, 1.28 to 2.47). Adults with a high body-fat percentage were also 3.62 times more likely to die from heart disease (HR 3.62; 95% CI, 1.55 to 8.45).

Overweight/obese BMI (25 kg/m² or higher) was not associated with a statistically significant higher risk of death from any cause, compared with adults in the healthy BMI range (HR 1.25, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.84).

Adults with a high waist circumference (more than 40 inches in men; more than 35 inches in women) were 1.59 times more likely to die from any cause than individuals in the healthy range (HR 1.59; 95% CI, 1.12 to 2.26). Adults with a high waist circumference were also 4.01 times more likely to die from heart disease (HR 4.01; 95% CI, 1.94 to 8.27).

Why it matters: The study findings support reexamining how body composition is measured in clinical settings. Historically, it has been difficult to measure body fat percentage in primary care outpatient settings. New bioelectrical impedance devices have the potential to change this.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Genetic profiling offers hope for understanding multiple sclerosis risk","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250729/Genetic-profiling-offers-hope-for-understanding-multiple-sclerosis-risk.aspx","Tue, 29 Jul 2025 19:26:00 GMT","

In a major step towards early detection, University of South Australia researchers are investigating the biology behind multiple sclerosis (MS) to help predict people's genetic risk of developing the disease, long before any symptoms appear.

Funded by an MS Australia Incubator Grant announced today, the Australian-first study will use a powerful new research method known as 'recall by genotype' to explore genetic causes of MS.

Specifically, the study will explore links between MS and the Epstein-Barr virus – a common virus best known for causing glandular fever, but increasingly believed to be a trigger for MS.

MS is a chronic autoimmune disease that disrupts communication between the brain, spinal cord and body. Affecting more than 33,000 Australians, the exact cause of MS remains unknown, though genetics and environmental factors are thought to play a key role.

Lead researcher, UniSA's Dr. David Stacey, says the research aims to untangle how the Epstein-Barr virus might lead to MS in some people but not others.

""For many years we've known that the Epstein-Barr virus is a likely precursor for MS,"" Dr Stacey says.

""But because the virus affects up to 90% of the population, it's difficult to pin down why some people go on to develop MS while others don't.

""We believe the way a person's immune system responds to the Epstein-Barr virus may be a key factor, and genetics can help us uncover that.""

The study will calculate MS genetic risk scores for more than 1000 South Australian participants without an MS diagnosis, then compare biological traits in a subset of participants with either high or low genetic risk.

By grouping people based on their genetic profile, we expect to find those with a high genetic risk for MS will also show biological differences – even if they don't have the disease. That could reveal how the Epstein-Barr virus and MS are connected and identify early warning signs or biomarkers for MS.""

Dr. David Stacey, Lead Researcher

To enable this study, the researchers will use an innovative research design called 'recall by genotype' – or RbG for short. RbG studies use naturally occurring genetic variants that are strongly associated with a disease to group people for research. Participants are then 'recalled' for further testing based on their DNA, allowing researchers to study differences in a more targeted and reliable way.

The researchers have been working to establish resources to enable RbG studies in Australia, which until now have not been possible. This study will therefore help to establish standard operating procedures for participant recall and tackle important ethical questions about sharing genetic risk with research participants.

""If we identify people who are at risk of developing MS, we need to consider how – and whether – to share that information, particularly as this information may not yet be clinically actionable,"" Dr Stacey says.

""This study will explore those ethical, legal and social questions to guide how future studies approach personal genetic risk.""

Ultimately, the research team – which includes collaborators from the Perron Institute and the University of Adelaide – hopes the study will pave the way for larger investigations and help support the development of early diagnostic tools and future preventative strategies for MS.

Background and goal: The Enhanced Primary Care Diabetes (EPCD) model is a nurse-led care delivery model that leverages multidisciplinary support to improve diabetes care quality in primary care settings. This study assessed whether patients of different racial and ethnic groups benefited equally.

Study approach: The authors reviewed health records for 1,749 adults aged 18 to 75 years from 13 family medicine and internal medicine practices in Mayo Clinic Rochester who joined the EPCD program from Jan. 1 to Dec. 31, 2020. They followed each patient's progress through Aug. 1, 2022, to see how long it took to meet five publicly-reported diabetes care goals known as D5: a blood pressure reading lower than 140/90; taking a statin medicine to lower bad cholesterol; blood sugar or HbA1c reading of less than 8%; living tobacco-free; and taking a daily dose of aspirin as appropriate. They then compared those times across racial and ethnic groups, accounting for differences in age, sex, where patients live, type of diabetes, number of medications, insulin use, and any gaps in care at the start.

Main results:

60.7% (1,061 patients) met the D5 during the study period.

Black patients with diabetes were less likely than White patients to reach the D5 (HR 0.68; 95% CI, 0.52-0.90; P = .007). There was no difference among Asian and Hispanic patients compared to White patients. 

Compared to White patients, Asian patients had fewer nurse touch points (median 0.8 per year) during the study period, while Black patients had more (median 2.2 per year). Hispanic patients had no significant difference. 

Factors tied to slower D5 attainment included younger age, insulin use, fewer baseline D5 components met, and a lower medication count at program entry.

Why it matters: Black patients were significantly less likely to attain the D5 despite being engaged with the care team nurses more often than White patients. The findings of the study highlight the need to tailor chronic disease programs to socioeconomic and cultural context.

A new study published in the American Journal of Health Promotion finds that inadequate leisure-time aerobic physical activity accounts for $192 billion in annual healthcare costs among U.S. adults-12.6% of total national health care spending.

Researchers analyzed data from more than 76,000 adults between 2012 and 2019. The findings are stark:

Compared to active adults:

""Aerobic physical activity is an investment in health-it strengthens the heart, reduces chronic disease burdens, and empowers us to live with energy and freedom,"" said one of the study's co-authors, Dr. Adam Chen, of the University of Georgia's College of Public Health.

Despite modest national gains in physical activity, health care costs continue to rise, largely driven by preventable chronic conditions. The consequences are being felt across sectors.

""These findings provide further economic reasons for health systems, payers, and clinicians to integrate physical activity assessment, prescription, and referral into health care delivery,"" said co-author Laurie Whitsel, PhD, National Vice President of Policy Research at the American Heart Association and Senior Advisor to the national Physical Activity Alliance. ""We need to inspire and support people to make physical activity a regular part of their day.""

Co-author Jennifer Matjasko, PhD, of the CDC's Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity, underscored the power of a simple solution hiding in plain sight. ""Moving more throughout the day can help improve health and reduce health care costs,"" she said. ""Every step counts toward a healthier future.""

The Physical Activity Alliance, the nation's largest coalition advancing physical activity policy and systems change, is calling for immediate cross-sector action:

We're spending nearly one out of every eight health care dollars on something we can prevent. We need to view physical activity as an essential health care solution to inspire people to move across their day in recreation, to and from work, in their jobs, at home and in schools.""

Chivu provides optimistic update on Calhanoglu

Reveals Turk is raring to bounce back after CWC misery

Midfielder recently broke silence on Martinez feud

Follow GOAL on WhatsApp! 🟢📱

Inter head coach Chivu has provided a fresh update on Calhanoglu's fitness amid rumours that he could leave the club this summer, confirming that the midfielder has recovered from the injury relapse he suffered in training at the Club World Cup just days after featuring in the Champions League final.

The past few months have been arguably the lowest point of Calhanoglu's stint at Inter. After a shocking Serie A title race collapse and losing to rivals AC Milan in the semi-final of the Coppa Italia, the Turkish international suffered an injury in the 5-0 loss to Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League final. Despite the setback, he flew with his team-mates to the United States to feature in the Club World Cup, but his participation in the tournament was cut short after suffering a relapse during training.

The shock 2-0 loss to underdogs Fluminense in the round of 16 piled on to Calhanoglu's misery, with Inter captain Martinez firing shots at the 31-year-old. That prompted the former Milan man to post a long statement on social media in the aftermath of the incident as the feud played out in public. He was also linked with a summer transfer, with Galatasaray and Fenerbahce after him, but he has since put the feud with Martinez behind him and declared his desire to stay at San Siro.

Chivu has backed the 31-year-old to bounce back from the injury and chaos of the summer, telling reporters: ""I'm happy he's back healthy. He's worked hard this summer and is really hungry to bounce back. He was very disappointed in America for not being able to help the team. He tried in training and got hurt again. His expectations, and ours as well, were to have him for the second match. He's worked hard, and I saw him doing very well in the first training session.""

Calhanoglu has been training with the Inter squad, who began their pre-season training on July 26. They will kick-start their campaign against Torino in a Serie A fixture on August 25.","{'href': 'https://au.sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo.co'}","soccer"

If you're looking to get your hands on FIFA World Cup tickets for next year, you're not the only one.

One of the people tasked with getting tickets in the hands of Canadian fans is Canada Soccer CEO Kevin Blue, who started in the role in February 2024.

“Probably in the hundreds,” Blue said with a laugh in an interview with Offside when asked about how many ticket requests he's gotten for next year's tournament. “It will be growing substantially as the weeks and months go on.”

Canada Soccer has an eight per cent allotment of tickets for their home matches, with the choice of how to spread them out up to the federation. One of the ways it'll be using its tickets is through relaunching the CanadaRED fan program. The program has seven different tiers of support, five of which are paid, starting at a fee of $50 a year.



Canada is scheduled to play three group-stage matches, in Toronto on June 12 and in Vancouver on June 18 and 24. The Canadian national team could also play up to an additional two knockout-round matches on Canadian soil, in the Round of 32 and the Round of 16, both in Vancouver.

Each tier will be given an equal number of tickets for next year's World Cup, though higher tiers, by nature, may have a smaller number of members competing for tickets. Pricing for the tickets has yet to be announced.

“It's also really important to note that people don't actually have to make a monetary contribution to be part of CanadaRED and to be eligible to win a lottery, to have access to World Cup tickets,” Blue added.



Blue noted that in addition to the tickets available to the general public, some of Canada's tickets will be allocated to player families, longstanding members of the Voyageurs supporters group, and alumni in the Canada Soccer Hall of Fame.

“We're trying to do our best in the context of the World Cup ticket access issue, to be thoughtful about accommodations for long-standing members of the Canadian soccer community, while also building and enhancing a revenue stream that is going to reinvest proceeds directly back into the sport,” Blue added.

Interested fans can sign up via the Canada Soccer website.

For those who might sign up for CanadaRED but not end up with World Cup tickets, Blue hopes that people recognize the projects their contributions end up supporting the national team and other soccer programs throughout the country.

In conjunction with commercial partners, the Canadian government and the third-party agency Canadian Soccer Business that handles much of the national team's commercial endeavours, including media rights, Blue stressed CanadaRED as a key component of Canada Soccer's revenue generation plan moving forward.

“This is ultimately about making contributions to help support the continued growth of the sport,” Blue said. “If you have competitive aspirations that are, say, top 30, top 25 in the world, on the men's side and top 10, top five, top three on the women's side, you have to have resources that are commensurate with those aspirations.”

Canada currently has five matches set to be played before the FIFA World Cup begins next year, with two of them on home soil.

So far, both home matches will be in Montreal, which missed out on a chance to host World Cup games next summer, with Australia announced as one of the two opponents. Canada will also be playing a neutral-site game against Colombia in New Jersey, and road contests against Romania and Wales.

Blue highlighted sporting considerations (quality of opponent), appearance fees (to pay to the opponent) and travel considerations (for the players and staff) as to what typically goes into the decision-making when setting up upcoming friendlies.

“One of the major challenges that we have faced historically is availability of facilities that have natural grass playing surfaces,” Blue said, a not-so-subtle reference to the current turf field at Vancouver's BC Place, one of the largest stadiums in the country. (BC Place will have grass for next year's World Cup.)

The Canadian men's national team has played in Vancouver just three times over the last six years. They've played twice in Edmonton, once in Hamilton, and thirteen times in Toronto since the start of 2019 in all competitions, including World Cup qualifying, the Gold Cup, and friendly matches.

They last played in Winnipeg in 2000, Ottawa in 1999, and have not played in other major cities like Calgary, Quebec City, or Regina during that time.

“We're eager to continue to move the teams around. Canada is a big country. We understand that it's hard for people who live in various parts of Canada to commute to games like they might be able to in smaller countries in Europe. So we are eager to move teams around, and it is a significant sort of puzzle to put together,” Blue added.

Ticket sales have also been an inconsistent challenge for the men's team in recent years, as they have not drawn above 25,000 fans for a match on home soil since March 2022.

“We're a nonprofit organization. We're not trying to generate maximum revenue for the sake of making profit,” Blue said. “We want to be able to make revenue and be commercially successful so that we can fund the operation of our national teams and other things that we do at the grassroots level. I think if you look at how our friendly ticket pricing has gone, it's  relatively more affordable compared to other high-profile sporting events.”

With less than a year to go until Canada's first match at next year's World Cup, all eyes will be on the squad — and its management team — to see how they handle this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

“It's a responsibility and a privilege that all of us take extremely seriously,” Blue said.

Denis Shapovalov will ride into his hometown tournament with plenty of confidence.

The World No. 29 bounced back from sluggish performances on the clay and grass courts in Europe by making it to the final in Los Cabos two weeks ago.

Shapovalov eventually fell to Aleksandar Kovacevic in the final, but it was an encouraging sign that the Canadian shot-maker was back in his comfort zone on the hard courts of North America.

“El Shapo” won a title on the hard courts of Dallas earlier this year and then followed that with an impressive run to the semifinals in Acapulco.

But there's something about coming home that doesn't sit quite right with the Toronto native.

Shapovalov became the youngest player to ever make it to the semifinals of the Canadian Masters in 2017, but he's never come close to matching that showing in the years since.

The 26-year-old is 3-5 in this event since his historic run, and he's lost his last four matches in Canada. 

There's never been a question about Shapovalov's talent, but he tends to unravel quickly when things get away from him on court, and that pressure only becomes more pronounced when he's playing in front of his hometown fans.

Shapovalov's tendency to spiral makes him a tough player to back as a chunky favorite, which is where he stands for Tuesday's match against rising American talent Learner Tien, who has four wins in five matches since Wimbledon.

Tien's game is growing, and he should be able to give Shapovalov enough problems to warrant a bet Tuesday.

The Play: Learner Tien (+150, bet365)

Nava – Humbert: 29.07.2025 17:00 CEST
H2H: 0-1

Emiliano Nava has won three of his last five matches. Last week in Washington, Nava lost against Tien in the opening round in straight sets. This week in Toronto, the American qualified for the main draw of the tournament. In the opening main draw round, Nava defeated Bergs in straight sets.

Ugo Humbert has lost three of his last five matches. His last match was at Wimbledon, where he lost against Monfils in the opening round.

According to the bookies, Humbert is the slight favourite in this matchup, and we agree. Nava never succeeded at the Masters 1000 level. On the other hand, Humbert is a great hard-court player and hopes for a solid result to enter the top 20 in the rankings. We expect him to be a better player tonight and win easily.

That being said, Humbert covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Ugo Humbert -3.5 games handicap @1.80 @bet365

Barrios Vera – Michelsen: 29.07.2025 18:30 CEST
H2H: first meeting

Tomas Barrios Vera has lost three of his last five matches. Last week in Umag, Barrios Vera lost to Navone in the opening round in straight sets. This week in Toronto, he qualified for the main draw of the tournament. In the opening main draw round, he defeated Monfils in three tight sets.

Alex Michelsen has lost three of his last five matches. Last week in Washington, the American lost against Evans in the opening round in straight sets.

According to the bookies, Michelsen is the favourite in this matchup, and we agree. He is having a breakthrough season and will be a top 20 player soon enough. We expect Michelsen to dominate under these conditions.

That being said, Michelsen covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Alex Michelsen -4.5 games handicap @1.83 @bet365

Medvedev – Svrcina: 30.07.2025 00:30 CEST
H2H: first meeting

Daniil Medvedev has lost three of his last five matches. Last week in Washington, the Russian lost to Moutet in the quarterfinals in three tight sets. So far this season, Medvedev has not had any remarkable results. He is the tenth seed this week in Toronto.

Dalibor Svrcina has lost four of his last five matches. This week in Toronto, Svrcina failed to qualify for the main draw tournament, where he lost to Watanuki in the final qualifying round. However, with several players withdrawing from the tournament, he entered the main draw as a lucky loser. In the opening main draw round, the Czech defeated Blockx in straight sets.

According to the bookies, Medvedev is the favourite in this matchup, and we agree. He played well last week in Washington and showed glimpses of his best form. On the other hand, Svrcina is in terrible form and has even struggled at the Challenger Tour level this season. We expect Medvedev to win easily.

That being said, Medvedev covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Daniil Medvedev -6.5 games handicap @2.00 @bet365

Holger Rune may not be renowned for booming serves or towering aces, but he hit 6'8” powerhouse Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard with a taste of his own medicine on Tuesday at the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers.

After withdrawing from his opener in Washington last week due to back pain, Rune returned to claim a 7-6(7), 6-3 victory in Toronto, his first hard-court win since reaching the Indian Wells final in March. The fifth-seeded Dane fired 12 aces to Mpetshi Perricard's seven and did not face a break point, according to Infosys ATP Stats, during their 76-minute clash.

“I haven't served like this in a while,” said Rune, who dropped just three of 21 second-serve points. “I've been working on some small adjustments on my serve and it seems to be feeling good. It felt really good and I trusted it all the way.

“When he's hitting those big serves, there's not much to do, so it's just about focusing on your own serve. I think I did that well. I'm just very happy with the match in general.”

Despite withdrawing on the day of his D.C. opener, Rune spent three days in Washington working with Andre Agassi.Their time together may have been short, but the former World No. 4 Rune looks sharp upon return to action for the first time since his first-round loss at Wimbledon last month.

Mpetshi Perricard dropped 17 aces on Rune en route to the Basel title last year, but the 22-year-old Dane used the quick conditions at the Canadian ATP Masters 1000 event to earn revenge and level their Lexus ATP Head2Head series at 1-1.

With a 23-14 tour-level record in 2025, highlighted by winning the Barcelona title in April, Rune is 15th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. He will next face Alexandre Muller in Toronto.

Lorenzo Musetti, who is sixth in the Live Race and aiming to debut at the Nitto ATP Finals, also came through his opening Toronto test in straight sets on Tuesday, beating James Duckworth 7-5, 6-1. With his win, the 23-year-old Italian snapped a three-match losing streak after first-round exits in Wimbledon and Washington.

The 23-year-old Italian owns a Tour-leading 17 wins at ATP Masters 1000 level this year, but 13 have come on clay. If he is to strengthen his chances of competing in Turin, he must carry the form he gathered during the European clay-court swing — where he reached the semi-finals at all three Masters events and Roland Garros — into the North American hard-court season.

Musetti will next play Alex Michelsen, who edged Tomas Barrios Vera 7-6(7), 6-3 in a tense second-round clash. The 26th-seeded American saved three set points in the opening set before racing through the second to earn his first win in Toronto.



In other early action on Day 3 in Toronto, Emilio Nava dismantled French lucky loser Terence Atmane 6-2, 7-5 to record consecutive tour-level wins for the second time after reaching the quarter-finals in Los Cabos two weeks ago. The 23-year-old American will next face 11th seed Karen Khachanov, who eased past Argentine qualifier Juan Pablo Ficovich 6-4, 6-2.

Things could have turned out so differently this year for Grigor Dimitrov, who has just been dealt another disappointing blow. The Bulgarian veteran was set to cause a huge shock at Wimbledon after winning the first two sets of his match with  Jannik Sinner, before disaster struck.

The 34-year-old tore his pectoral muscle while serving at the start of the third. Immediately, he winced in pain before going down on the turf. In emotional scenes, Dimitrov was then seen by medical staff before confirming his tournament was over.

He was then forced to watch from afar as Sinner went on to win the Grand Slam, beating Carlos Alcaraz in the final. Dimitrov has now been forced to withdraw from next month's US Open.

His manager, Georgi Stoimenov, confirmed the news. Not only is the world No.20 being forced to miss Flushing Meadows, where he made the semi-final in 2019, but his remarkable Grand Slam run is also over.



Dimitrov has made 58 consecutive appearances at majors, a record that dates back to the 2011 Australian Open. It's a stat that no current player on the ATP Tour can match.

Dimitrov also now faces a race against time to play at the Shanghai Masters, which begins on September 25. The event in China gets underway the following week.

After his injury against Sinner, Dimitrov posted a photo on social media from his hospital bed, and vowed to come back. He wrote: “Having to withdraw from Wimbledon was one of the most heartbreaking moments of my career.

“Thank you for the overwhelming wave of love, your messages have genuinely lifted me through these hard times. Recovery starts now. I'll see you all soon.”

Paula Badosa will now partner Jack Draper for the US Open mixed doubles after her reported split from Stefanos Tsitsipas 

An updated entry list was unveiled on July 22, with Tsitsipas and Badosa one of two pairs to quietly pull out.

British No.1 Jack Draper and Qinwen Zheng were also no longer on the list, with both players suffering from recent injuries.

However, it has now been confirmed that Draper and Badosa will unite for a blockbuster partnership at the newly revamped mixed doubles event.

It was a shock inclusion and has only fuelled the fire of a Tsitsipas Badosa break-up.

The popular duo, often nicknamed 'Tsitsidosa', were reported to have split up during Wimbledon.

Fans spotted that they had unfollowed each other on Instagram and posts of them together had been deleted.

Tsitipas and Badosa had been considered a tennis 'power couple' and first started dating in 2023. 

However, only a day after both of them were beaten in the opening round at Wimbledon, reports of a break-up swirled. 

HOLA.com said that sources have confirmed their split, with one saying: ""The break-up just happened. They both lost in the first round in London and everything has come together for them.""

There was no official confirmation of why they pulled out, but both players remain on the singles entry list.

Tsitsipas has a poor record at major tournaments this year heading into the US Open, only winning once in 2025.

The Greek star was openly criticised by his coach at SW19 and he will want a major improvement at Flushing Meadows.

Meanwhile, alongside a quick exit at Wimbledon, Badosa failed to make it past the round of 32 at Roland Garros after reaching the semi-finals at the Australian Open.

It will be all eyes on the singles for both stars now, following their withdrawal from the doubles competition.

The US Open Mixed Doubles Championship will be staged across two days in New York City, beginning on August 19. 

A total of 16 teams will compete for a $1million prize.

Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu are the standout pairing, with Wimbledon champion Jannik Sinner playing with Emma Navarro.

Novak Djokovic is teaming up with Olga Danilovic, Iga Swiatek joins Casper Ruud and Taylor Fritz plays with Elena Rybakina.

Nick Kyrgios is planning to return to action too, pairing up with Naomi Osaka for the event in New York - however they are yet to officially feature.

Venus Williams' comeback is headed to the U.S. Open next month, when she will enter the redesigned mixed doubles tournament with Reilly Opelka via a wild-card entry.

The 45-year-old Williams, who returned to the tennis tour last week after more than a year away, and Opelka were among the 14 teams announced Tuesday by the U.S. Tennis Association for its mixed doubles event on Aug. 19-20.

Eight of the pairings received direct entry into the field based on having the highest combined current singles rankings, and six were given wild cards by the USTA.

The players with spots in the bracket include nine who have won at least one Grand Slam singles title and 14 who are ranked in the WTA or ATP top 10 for singles.

The eight duos with direct entry are No. 11 Emma Navarro and No. 1 Jannik Sinner; No. 10 Paula Badosa and No. 5 Jack Draper; No. 3 Iga Swiatek and No. 13 Casper Ruud; No. 12 Elena Rybakina and No. 4 Taylor Fritz; No. 7 Amanda Anisimova and No. 9 Holger Rune; Belinda Bencic and No. 3 Alexander Zverev; No. 4 Jessica Pegula and No. 15 Tommy Paul; No. 5 Mirra Andreeva and No. 14 Daniil Medvedev.

Badosa originally had sought a place in the field with Stefanos Tsitsipas, while Draper initially was going to play alongside Zheng Qinwen.

In addition to Williams-Opelka, the wild-card entrants are Emma Raducanu and No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz; No. 8 Madison Keys and No. 12 Frances Tiafoe; Olga Danilovic and No. 6 Novak Djokovic; Taylor Townsend — who made her debut at No. 1 in women's doubles this week — and No. 7 Ben Shelton; and last year's U.S. Open mixed doubles champions, Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori.

It's a group of star players that stands in stark contrast to the sort of lesser-known players and doubles specialists usually found in the mixed doubles bracket at a Grand Slam tournament. Some players were critical of the planned changes when they were announced in February, and Errani and Vavassori called the new setup a “pseudo-exhibition focused only on entertainment and show” that would shut out true doubles players.

In a bid to attract some of the sport's biggest names, the USTA increased the prize money, switched mixed doubles from the same time as the singles and other doubles events to the week before the start of singles competition and reduced the format to first-to-four-game sets with no-ad scoring.

A total of 16 duos will be competing for the $1 million top prize; the last two wild-card pairs will be announced by the USTA later.

It is still possible that Williams will ask for, and receive, a wild-card entry for singles. Those are expected to be announced by the USTA the week of Aug. 11.

She won one match each in singles and doubles at the D.C. Open in Washington last week after not competing anywhere since the Miami Open in March 2024.

Williams owns seven Grand Slam titles in singles, 14 in women's doubles — all won with her younger sister Serena — and two in mixed doubles.

The 6-foot-11 (2.11-meter) Opelka is a 27-year-old American who used to be ranked in the top 20 and is now No. 74 after missing nearly two full seasons because of injuries.

Among the partnerships the USTA had said were hoping to get into the tournament that were not on Tuesday's list: Katie Boulter and Alex de Minaur, who are engaged to be married; Jasmine Paolini and Lorenzo Musetti; Aryna Sabalenka and Grigor Dimitrov; Naomi Osaka and Nick Kyrgios; Karolina Muchova and Andrey Rublev; Iva Jovic and Jenson Brooksby; Gaby Dabrowski and Felix Auger-Aliassime; Demi Schuurs and Tallon Griekspoor; Katerina Siniakova and Marcelo Arevalo; Desirae Krawczyk and Evan King; and Su-Wei Hsieh and Jan Zielinski.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Piastri's Perfect Pass in Belgium

Radio Rewind: 2025 Belgian Grand Prix

Esteban Ocon and Ollie Bearman report back after the Begian Grand Prix, where neither Haas driver managed to score a point.

After a strong Sprint in Belgium that saw both Haas cars come home in the points, Esteban Ocon and Ollie Bearman were unable to repeat the feat in Sunday's Grand Prix at Spa as the former lamented too many ""costly mistakes"" from the team.

The Frenchman started in P11 – one slot higher than his team mate – and while he might have expected to struggle in the opening stages on the wet track, given he was running a lower downforce set-up than Bearman, his problems instead started as the track dried out.

Firstly, across the three-lap period where the whole field pitted for slick tyres, Ocon was one of the last called in, which cost him plenty of time and a fair few positions.

But worse was to come, when Haas opted to fit his car with a seven-lap old set of used medium tyres.

“I think we got today completely wrong really,” the Frenchman said following the Grand Prix. “We need to put everything together as a team, we had a decent car pace, which we showed later on when it was dry.

“[But] we were on a used set of tyres when we had a new one ready for us at the track. So, that is the first one of the two big mistakes, the other was staying two laps too long on the inter [intermediate tyre].

“We boxed too late on that. Two very costly mistakes that didn't help our race. 85% of the race I did with an old tyre, which yeah – performance loss for free really.”

Ocon came home in 15th place on a day where many of his midfield rivals scored – Williams, Racing Bulls, Kick Sauber and Alpine all winding up in the points. When asked why the team got it so wrong with the tyres, Ocon simply stated it was a “surprise” and that they would review afterwards.

As for Bearman, he was running a higher downforce set-up that should have paid dividends in the early part of the race on a wet track. But instead of challenging for the points again, he spent much of the Grand Prix managing an engine issue and wound up finishing 11th – for the fourth straight race.

While that was far from ideal, the rookie did find plenty of positives to take from the race – not least the fact that the latest batch of upgrades seem to be doing their job, and making Haas much more competitive.

“I think we were a little bit late with the first stop onto the medium, which put me just out of the points in P11,” Bearman explained of his race.

“Then unfortunately I had an engine issue and lost three positions. So, I was actually ahead of [Pierre] Gasly before that issue and with Nico [Hulkenberg] boxing later, I would have been a net P10. But unfortunately, we had an engine issue, I was actually managing some issues with the power unit for the whole race, so we have to have a look at why.

“But the car felt fantastic, I was just not able to overtake. It really sucked because the car was good. It was a shame to narrowly miss out on points, but we got some yesterday. I think we can be positive heading into Hungary. It's a track I think will suit us quite well, so fingers crossed.”

Qualifying and one-lap pace has been Haas' Achilles' heel this season, but with both cars making SQ3 on Friday, there has been a clear improvement in that area.

“We've been strong, we've been fast – on both downforce configurations because of course today and yesterday in Quali I had a different one to earlier in the weekend and both times I had the potential to be in Q3, so the car is clearly quick,” Bearman continued.

“We are making a few too many mistakes as a group so we have work to do, but we are going to get there.”

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Piastri's Perfect Pass in Belgium

Radio Rewind: 2025 Belgian Grand Prix

Ferrari Team Principal Fred Vasseur has claimed the mood in the Ferrari camp is good, despite a mixed weekend of results in Belgium.

Ferrari Team Principal Fred Vasseur has claimed ""the mood is good in the team"" after a double-points finish in the Belgian Grand Prix, but that ""we have to do a better job from the beginning"" of the weekend in Hungary.

Charles Leclerc claimed only his fifth podium of the season at Spa-Francorchamps on Sunday as he finished behind both McLaren drivers, while Lewis Hamilton made up 11 places from a pit lane start to claim P7 at the chequered flag.

The seven-time World Champion had endured a difficult weekend prior to the race, failing to make it beyond the first part of Qualifying for both the Sprint and Grand Prix after suffering a high-speed spin and losing his best lap to track limits respectively.

""The mood is good. For sure it's not the result that we are expecting with Lewis in the Quali yesterday, but I think it's part of the life of a racing team that we reacted collectively very well today, that Lewis did a great job,"" said Vasseur.

""He was quite aggressive at the beginning in the extreme conditions, he was able to fight with [Alex] Albon until the end and I think it was a good recovery for him also to be efficient like this.

""For sure that we have to do a better job from the beginning, that if you want to score podiums or wins that you can't let one session away and we will have to do a step next week [in Hungary], but we are all pushing in the same direction.""

Ferrari introduced a new suspension upgrade this weekend despite only having a single, one-hour practice session before Sprint Qualifying took place on Friday.

Vasseur admitted that the lack of running was not optimal as well as the race initially being held in wet conditions, but that it was necessary in order to be on the front foot this weekend for the Hungarian Grand Prix.

""It's never easy to introduce something on a Sprint weekend but we didn't want to postpone to Budapest,"" said Vasseur.

""It's true that with the format of the weekend, the fact that you don't long stint on Friday or you're doing a long stint of four laps, it's not easy to have references.

""But at the end I think it was the right call because it's also the best preparation for us for Hungary.""

He added: ""I think we are all in the same situation that the closer you will be to the end of the season, the more focused you will be on next year and for sure we will have to bring some small items until the end, more related to the layout of the track or the weather conditions or whatever, but no big package.""

Isack Hadjar and Liam Lawson give their takes on how the Belgian Grand Prix panned out for Racing Bulls.

Isack Hadjar was left to endure a ""frustrating"" Grand Prix at Spa as he dropped to the back of the field with a car issue, while team mate Liam Lawson delivered points with a strong drive to eighth place.

The Frenchman had looked okay in the initial stages, running in front of his team mate in P8, but as the track dried the team opted to call Lawson in first – when normally the lead car gets the preferential pit stop.

Pitting a lap later seemed to cost Hadjar, who dropped way down the order, but it soon became apparent that all was not right for the rookie, who was forced into a second stop despite his medium tyres not being that old.

That sent him to the back of the pack, where he stayed for the rest of a difficult Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps.

“Unfortunately, we had an issue with the car for almost the whole race and that made me lose quite a lot of lap time,” he explained, without going into any details over what exactly the problem was.

“We'll review the reasons why, but I was aware of it whilst I was driving, so I just tried to make the most out of it, doing my best. It was very frustrating, as I felt like the car underneath me was working really well.

“It's a shame for the team, as everyone has done an amazing job, and I think it could have been a double-points finish today after Liam's result. I'm confident going to Budapest, so we'll bounce back next week.""

For Lawson, his preferential pit stop brought him out in seventh – but he lost one place to a charging Lewis Hamilton. From there, he had the pace on the mediums to comfortably keep Gabriel Bortoleto at bay, for his second points score in the last three races.

And it was just reward after the frustrations in the wet at Silverstone, where Lawson crashed out at the start of the race.

""I really enjoyed today. Often in those conditions you just want to survive, so I'm very happy for the team and how everything came together,” the Kiwi racer said.

“It's always tricky when you cross over to a dry tyre when it's damp, but the car was fast and in clean air we had great pace. A lot of work goes into little details each weekend when the Championship is this tight, so now we need to keep the momentum rolling forward and make sure we enter the summer break on a high.”

Racing Bulls sit seventh in the Teams' Championship, and are just two points behind Kick Sauber. Lawson's points combined with Aston Martin failing to score mean they now have a bit more of a buffer to their rivals, to the tune of five points.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Piastri's Perfect Pass in Belgium

Radio Rewind: 2025 Belgian Grand Prix

McLaren Team Principal Andrea Stella has offered his view on the intra-team battle between Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris after a 1-2 in the Belgian Grand Prix.

McLaren Team Principal Andrea Stella admits he is ""not really interested in being comfortable"" when managing the title battle between drivers Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris after a 1-2 in the Belgian Grand Prix, adding that the pair are operating at the level of previous World Champions.

The pair locked out the front row for Sunday's race at Spa-Francorchamps, with Piastri coming out on top after overtaking polesitter Norris on the long run to Les Combes once racing got underway after a rain delay and Safety Car start.

Norris opted for the hard compound of tyre in comparison to Piastri on mediums when the pair made their only pit stops, and although the Briton closed a gap of 9.1s to just over 3s, Piastri took his sixth win of the campaign and extended his points margin to 16 points.

""There is very, very little between our two drivers, and this is because the two drivers are racing at a very, very high level,"" said Stella post-race, with Charles Leclerc's Ferrari 20s adrift of Piastri at the chequered flag in third.

""We are lucky at McLaren to have two drivers that deservedly are fighting for the World Championship. I think the difference will be made by the accuracy, the precision, the quality of the execution. We saw in Silverstone that an issue, a sporting issue for Oscar during the Safety Car start and the consequent penalty cost him the race.

""And somehow here, we saw that somehow related to the circuit characteristic like we said before, it would have always been very difficult for Lando to keep the position starting first at the Safety Car restart.""

He added: ""Like I said before, we have two drivers, which to the standards that even myself in my career I've been close to, driving with multiple world champions [including Michael Schumacher, Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen]. I think Lando and Oscar are operating at that level, at the level of deservedly being in contention for the Drivers' World Championship.""

After losing the lead, Norris complained of derating over the radio with Stella confirming that ""there was a slight anomaly"" with the battery that impacted both cars but that ""it's very difficult for the car that leads the pack to actually arrive first in Turn 5"".

Regarding the strategy, Stella suggested it was Norris' decision not to double stack behind Piastri and also his choice to use the hard rubber in the hopes of having a tyre advantage later in the race.

""The choice was open. Lando had a couple of lock-ups in Turn 1 and also a little oversteering in Turn 9 that cost him time,"" said Stella.

""I think this overall prevented us from having an interesting battle possibly at the end, but in fairness, even Oscar had a couple of times in Turn 1 a little bit of a time loss.

""It's very difficult when you push so much in these conditions, it's very difficult to always drive within the limit of the grip.""

The fourth film in the comedy franchise will be released on Aug. 1. 


							By 

	Abid Rahman


International Editor, Digital


	It's been a 31-year wait, but the latest addition to The Naked Gun franchise is finally here. Full critics' reviews for the film drop on Wednesday, but fans of the classic spoof comedy franchise can breathe a huge sigh of relief, as the early social media reaction from Monday's New York premiere and press screenings is extremely effusive. 


	The new iteration of The Naked Gun, stars Liam Neeson as Lt. Frank Drebin Jr., the son of Police Squad legend Frank Drebin, played in the franchise's previous projects by the late Leslie Nielsen. Pamela Anderson, Paul Walter Hauser, Kevin Durand, Danny Huston, Liza Koshy, Cody Runnels and CCH Pounder round out the cast.

	The Lonely Island's Akiva Schaffer directs the reboot and Seth MacFarlane produces a project that Paramount has had in the works for decades. The film franchise is based on the 1982 ABC television series Police Squad!, a spoof on police procedural dramas that introduced Nielsen as Drebin and was co-created and written by David Zucker, Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker. Though the TV show was short-lived, the creative team reunited for the first feature in the franchise, 1988's The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!. Two more sequels were released: The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear in 1991 and Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult in 1994.

The Naked Gun will be released in theaters worldwide on Aug. 1. Before the film's release, and full critics' reviews, read on for a sampling of early reaction from Monday's premiere and press screenings.

there are like six different scenes in The Naked Gun that made me laugh so hard I cried. even the title card is funny. I wrote “SO DUMB (complimentary)” in my notebook several times.

Akiva Schaffer's THE NAKED GUN is a freakin' miracle – a contemporary comedy that's tightly scripted (under 90 minutes!), hilariously funny, and has a simple, meaningful message about the state of the world. And it ends with one of its best laughs – stay for the credits! pic.twitter.com/qFD1jCcNMR

I've seen the new THE NAKED GUN twice now and it's really funny. It's on par with 2 1/2 and 33 1/3

THE NAKED GUN (2025): might have laughed harder during this than any movie this year. Really clever and very self-aware, and captures the original's charm well. Also, one of Liam Neeson's best performances in so long. Loved Pamela Anderson here too. What a blast. #TheNakedGun pic.twitter.com/GfgnFZ1tRK

The #NakedGun is an outrageously hilarious, balls to the wall laugh-fest that perfectly captures what made us fall in love with this franchise. Neeson and Anderson are pure comedy gold. I really missed movies this funny and unapologetically silly. Leslie Nielsen would be proud. pic.twitter.com/kBpHeGdLDE

Big “they just don't make these like this anymore” vibes from THE NAKED GUN (2025). Funny as hell I think I ruptured a spine or a ribcage or a cheekbone because of how hard I was laughing throughout it. Kiv just took me to gag city  and I wanna go back! pic.twitter.com/qcwm60CqE5

THE NAKED GUN (2025): [“we used to make things in this country” voice] it turns out we are evidently still making things in this country

The Naked Gun is hilarious. Having just watched the original three, it would have been easy for this one to feel like a pale imitation. Instead, it feels like a Naked Gun movie, in all its dumb glory. I laughed so hard. More comedies on the big screen!@NakedGunMovie #NakedGun pic.twitter.com/xpDc6XgYy7

THE NAKED GUN becomes competitive for funniest movie of the year within about 10 minutes and it doesn't really run out of gas. Probably better in a lot of ways than the Zucker sequels? And I say that as someone who has seen them like 10x each.

#TheNakedGun exists at the intersection of silly and smart, reinventing Liam Neeson as a comedic icon for a new generation of filmgoers to laugh out loud with until it hurts. Theatrically released comedy is back! pic.twitter.com/yEo64UKPkL

I'll have a review later this week but I went to a Naked Gun screening tonight and that shit brought the whole house down

The Naked Gun was hilarious… been a long time since I've been at a press screening where film critics are laughing so hard. Maybe Shaun of the Dead was the last time? I not only recommend you see it but I BEG you to see it cause I definitely want more of this!

Akiva Schaffer's The Naked Gun is a breath of fresh air in modern comedy. Genuinely hilarious, blissfully brief, and a pitch-perfect homage to Leslie Nielsen's '80s comedy classic without feeling like a tired cover band. Never playing it safe, it follows the golden rule: be funny… pic.twitter.com/5So6vGshni

THE NAKED GUN is outrageous and hilarious, reminding us of the movies we just don't see nowadays.  It's ridiculous and over-the-top in every way, with some truly shocking moments that'll have you crying with laughter.  Liam Neeson brilliantly-embodies Leslie Nielsen as well! pic.twitter.com/UvvC19yXRO

#NakedGun is one of the funniest movies I've seen in ages. Akiva Schaffer delivers a worthy successor to the Leslie Nielsen classics that also stands well on its own.They really don't make comedies like this anymore. The crowd's energy was infectious — see this in theatres! pic.twitter.com/pGtZI9tA65

THE NAKED GUN is the hardest I've laughed during a film in a really long time. This is full of delightfully silly, scorching gags that retain a 90's energy and incorporate modern critiques. So much fun. pic.twitter.com/aquhICPLX9

#TheNakedGun is hilarious from beginning to end.  I missed multiple jokes because the theater was laughing too loud. They just nailed the classic Naked Gun and deadpan comedy w/ its own flavor and not just copying the past A comedy legacy sequel done right. pic.twitter.com/ex9S5mZIdg

THE NAKED GUN might be the most joke-per-minute movie we've had in decades. Dumb, goofy, HYSTERICAL. Also there's a BUFFY joke in there that was made just for me

#NakedGun works because it understands how much fun it is to laugh out loud in a packed movie theatre. And it's funny! It's very much in the spirit of the originals, following the same multiple gags a minute formula. Liam Neeson is wonderfully deadpan, Pamela Anderson steals it. pic.twitter.com/Lfc0YLuBPQ

The Naked Gun was hysterical. A very funny legacy sequel! It perfectly captured the silliness of the original and made it its own. Liam Neeson would totally make Leslie Nielsen proud 😂🤣 and I loved that Pamela Anderson was just game for all of it.#TheNakedGun #NakedGun pic.twitter.com/9iNnB2JswR

THE NAKED GUN: Absolutely as silly and fun as I'd hoped AND there's a MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE — FALLOUT reference. So. Basically movie of the year

I laughed more in the first two minutes of THE NAKED GUN then I did in four seasons of THE BEAR.

Four staffers were also let go at Warner Music Nashville amid a $300 million cost-cutting effort at parent Warner Music Group.


													By
												

	Melinda Newman



As Warner Music Group (WMG) works to cut annual costs by $300 million, it has made significant changes at Warner Records and Warner Music Nashville. 


	In a realignment of its marketing department, Warner Records has combined the digital and traditional marketing teams, resulting in several promotions and at least three staffers being let go. 


	WMG CEO Robert Kyncl informed the staff of the pending changes in a July 1 staff memo obtained by Billboard. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	“Many changes will be implemented in the next three months, with the remainder in fiscal 2026,” Kyncl wrote. Staff cuts will account for $170 million of the planned reductions.


	Warner Records' revamped marketing team will now be run by Dalia Ganz, who has been promoted to executive vp/head of digital & marketing and will report to Warner Records GM Mike Chester. 


	Reporting to Ganz are Sam Riddle, who has been promoted to senior vp/head of digital marketing and Will Morrow, who has been upped to senior vp/head of viral marketing. Three executives have also been raised from vps to senior vps of marketing strategy and operations:  Jesse Ervin, TJ Landig and Shawnae Corbett-Rice. 


	The commerce team has also been restructured and will be led by Axel Hyge, senior vp of streaming strategy, and Dave Edwards, senior vp of revenue & operations. 


	A number of executives are leaving as a result of the changes, Warner Records said in a statement, including Dionnee Harper, executive vp of marketing & artist development; Josh Remsberg, senior vp/head of commercial revenue and Kristine Ripley, vp of artist development. 


	“This is a reimagining of how we can best market and develop exceptional talent. It's designed for speed, intelligence, collaboration, and top flight service to our incredible roster,” Chester said in the July 1 memo. “Dalia is a future forward executive whose digital marketing expertise has been pivotal to our recent success. And Sam, Will, Jesse, TJ, Shawnae, Axel, and Dave are the best in the business, bringing incredible enthusiasm, knowledge, and experience to their work. Together with their entire teams, I have no doubt they'll do a phenomenal, industry-leading job for our artists as we continue to build groundbreaking careers in a rapidly expanding musical universe.”


	Additionally, Warner Music Nashville, which reports through Warner Records, let go of four staffers in the restructuring: radio manager Ray Mariner, manager of video content Andrew Schollnick, director of catalog marketing Sarah Sigro and director of global marketing Caitlin Cadden. Country Aircheck first reported the cuts.


	A Warner Music Nashville representative confirmed the cuts and added in a statement, “As we continue to deepen our commitment to original artists, we're working with Warner Records and our global network to create faster, more impactful opportunities for Nashville talent. As part of this evolution, we're forming two supercharged radio promotion teams to deliver even greater results for our artists. Today, we made the difficult decision to say goodbye to four colleagues who all leave with our deep gratitude and best wishes for their next chapters.” 


	In his July 1 memo, Kyncl indicated that the money freed up through these cuts will be reinvested in A&R and M&A. Also on July 1, WMG announced the launch of its $1.2 billion catalog acquisition venture with Bain Capital.


	This is the latest in a series of WMG layoffs since 2023, including a 4% staff reduction in March 2023, a 10% cut in 2024 and an Atlantic Records restructuring last September.

I've been on the show for 7 1/2 years. So, I was curious about what else was out there and wanted to switch it up. That was kind of it, but it was hard. It was very bittersweet and emotional.”


	During her time on Chicago P.D., Spiradakos played the same character across the other two One Chicago shows: Chicago Fire and Chicago Med, during special crossover events.


	Before her work on P.D., Spiridakos played the series regular role of Charlie Matheson on the NBC post-apocalyptic series Revolution across the show's two seasons. For her portrayal, she received a Saturn Award Nomination for Best Actress on Television.

EXCLUSIVE: Jennifer Hudson, Aaron Pierre, Jelly Roll, Ayesha Curry, Andrew Santino, Bobby Lee Sherry Cola and Eduardo Franco are set to join the voice cast of the Sony Animation pic Goat.


	They join previously announced cast members Stephen Curry, Caleb McLaughlin, Gabrielle Union, Nick Kroll, Nicola Coughlan, David Harbour, Jenifer Lewis and Patton Oswalt. The animated sports comedy is directed by Tyree Dillihay and co-directed by Adam Rosette.


	The film is an original action-comedy set in an all-animal world. The story follows Will, a small goat with big dreams who gets a once-in-a-lifetime shot to join the pros and play roarball — a high-intensity, co-ed, full-contact sport dominated by the fastest, fiercest animals in the world. Will's new teammates aren't thrilled about having a little goat on their roster, but Will is determined to revolutionize the sport and prove once and for all that “smalls can ball.”

	











	In collaboration with the NBA, Sony Pictures Animation will release Goat theatrically on February 13, timed for NBA All-Star Weekend in Los Angeles.

	The film is produced by Stephen Curry and Erick Peyton of Unanimous Media, Michelle Raimo Kouyate, Adam Rosenberg, and Rodney Rothman of Modern Magic. David Schulenburg serves as co-producer, with Rick Mischel and Fonda Snyder as executive producers.


	“Directing voice actors for animation is like conducting musicians in an orchestra and Goat is the symphony,” said Dillihay and Rosette. “We are extremely blessed to be directing this incredible cast bringing charisma, creativity and comedy to our love letter to the underdog.”

	











	Said Peyton and Curry of Unanimous Media: “We're thrilled to keep building an incredible roster of talent that brings the characters of Goat to life.

					By Lynette Rice 

Senior TV Writer


Beyond the Gates has hit its first milestone.


	The CBS sudser hit 100 episodes Tuesday, so in celebration, creator Michele Val Jean and executive producer Sheila Ducksworth reflected on the show's progress so far, their breakout storylines, and what fans can expect in the near future (like more from the Articulettes).


DEADLINE: 100 episodes! How does it feel?  


MICHELE VAL JEAN: I feel a hundred years older. It's hard to wrap my head around it. It's quite a milestone.


SHEILA DUCKSWORTH: At 100 episodes, I'm feeling like we're just beginning!




			Watch on Deadline		







DEADLINE: You are great about engaging with fans on social media. 












DUCKSWORTH: Soap fans are awesome and like no other. Before we even aired our first episode, tens of thousands of people joined pages and podcasts and accounts that they themselves created. And it's just grown from there over these past five months we've been on air. I love hearing all the wild predictions and also providing the extra insights and interesting backstories behind the show, whenever I'm able.


VAL JEAN: I think it's good to have a social media presence, and I always have, but it's challenging in my new role as a creator and head writer. It's tempting to respond to criticism. But I really have to stop myself, especially if somebody's being loud and wrong. It's really hard to say no, but I think I'm getting better at it. I try to go on when I think there's something that I need to say.


DEADLINE: Like, for example, when you made the change with the Ted Richardson character?












VAL JEAN: I did not respond to any of it because it's a personal matter to the show and to the actor, and it's really not my place to comment on it, so I just didn't say anything. People were very upset, but what can I say? What can you say? Sometimes changes get made.


DEADLINE: I want to jump right into a storyline that's been so provocative — the one involving Martin [played by Brandon Claybon] and how he was attacked on that deserted country road. An offensive slur was used by his attackers.


VAL JEAN: I decided to go down that road because I wanted to show something that happens that you'd never see on daytime. It happens. It's like people being recast. It happens. I'm telling a story from the Black experience. A lot of it based around a Black family who is privileged and wealthy, but at the end of the day, they can still be accosted on the side of the road by racists. It's shocking and I meant it to be very shocking, and I think production and the actors did an amazing job. It was controversial, but I don't think controversial is wrong. It's hard to be that right now. And so I give all credit to the network for standing behind it and believing in it. And as far as whether stories like that kind of live on in the psyche of this world that I've created, I wouldn't be surprised to see some repercussions down the line. Martin still has a lot of healing to do because he's sublimated so much of that because he had to. Nicole still has a lot to work out because she's so angry at being left out, and she feels like she could have helped him and her role as a psychiatrist. Vernon and Anita, even though they felt like they did what they had to do at the time by covering it up, are now feeling the repercussions of that. Now another guy is dead and now they're in debt to Joey Armstrong. So yeah, the tentacles do live on.


DUCKSWORTH: The Martin storyline is just real. And that's what we're looking to give our viewers.  Realness on every level.


DEADLINE: Maryland is right next to DC. Will we ever know who their president is in this world? 


VAL JEAN: No. I want to stay away from politics in the show as much as I can with a Black congressman, but I want this show to be entertaining, not polarizing.


DEADLINE: I've noticed there hasn't been a Febreze mention in a couple of weeks.


VAL JEAN: It's making a comeback. And Tide will be coming back as well.


DEADLINE: Did Procter & Gamble give you any guidelines on how to integrate those products, or is that all up to you?


VAL JEAN: We get guidelines from P&G, but they're just that. The way we write it is us, but there are certain things they want said.


DUCKSWORTH: The relationship we have with P&G is a partnership in every sense of the word. We have joint creative oversight on all our integrations, with P&G sometimes even joining us on shoot day.  


DEADLINE: Is there any chance of an Articulettes reunion later on?


VAL JEAN: August 1 and 4.


DEADLINE: I understood the benefit of running a week of reruns during the July 4 holiday week. Do you see this becoming a norm with the soap going forward? 


VAL JEAN: I'm not sure. Those decisions are made way above my head. I'm hoping that we won't have a lot. I saw the value of that first week too, because if you didn't watch it from the beginning, then you could get introduced to the world.

	











DUCKSWORTH: For those who missed out on Premiere Week, the repeats provided another opportunity to join us on day one. It gave others an opportunity to catch up on episodes. And for those superfans who know soap equals subtext, it gave our most stalwart fans an opportunity to re-watch and look for clues foreshadowing all the upcoming, juicy story.


DEADLINE: You only have Frank Carlivati working in your writers room for a short time. Why couldn't he stick around for longer? 


VAL JEAN: Ron, Bob Guza and Chris Dunn all agreed to come on to help me launch the series. Now they're off to do other things. There's no animosity. I'm so grateful to have had their knowledge and their humor and their contribution, and I can't say enough about them.


DEADLINE: Are there any cast additions coming up that you'd like to tease?


VAL JEAN: Yes, we have a cast edition that I think the soap opera world will be very, very happy about. And it's a male.


DEADLINE: A hot male?


VAL JEAN: He's a hot male, yeah.


DUCKSWORTH: I can't say who just yet, but I will say longtime soap fans all know and love him! I will though give you two exciting names … Gizelle Bryant and Dr. Wendy Osefo from The Real Housewives of the Potomac. They both recently joined us for a day on set and they have some super fun scenes that we can't wait to share.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","The Fantastic Four: First Steps introduced the new MCU's most important character","https://www.avclub.com/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-mcu-most-important-character-franklin-richards","Tue, 29 Jul 2025 17:00:00 GMT","

In many ways, The Fantastic Four: First Steps is a blissfully standalone entry in the larger megafranchise. But those of us who've been around the block with these films know that it's never that simple. Along with the First Family's first child, Matt Shakman's film bears with it some important cross-film connective tissue.

For one thing, there's the declaration in the credits that the Fantastic Four will return for the already announced Avengers: Doomsday, a project centered around the team's archnemesis Doctor Doom (Robert Downey Jr.). For another, there's that Fantastic Four rocket emerging from space at the end of Thunderbolts*. But these are just the surface-level connections. Those who know their comics lore have probably already clocked that there's another, bigger connection to the wider Marvel picture, one contained in a very small package. He's still in diapers, but depending on how messy this new MCU gets, Franklin Richards might end up as its single most important character.

First off, yes, there's a baby that can resurrect the dead in the MCU now, and if you think that's going to complicate these stories a great deal in the years to come, you are likely correct. The son of Reed Richard (Pedro Pascal) and Sue Storm (Vanessa Kirby), Franklin Richards (Ada Scott) has been a part of the Marvel Comics world for nearly 60 years, first appearing in 1968 in the pages of Fantastic Four Annual #6, created by Marvel Comics' founding fathers Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. As in First Steps, his expectant parents worried that Franklin's DNA might be affected by the same cosmic radiation that gave them their powers, and as in The Fantastic Four: First Steps, Franklin started to exhibit extraordinary abilities even as a baby. 

For much of the 1970s, '80s, and '90s, Franklin's superpowers, though enormous, were often treated as something of a sideshow by the larger Marvel Universe. It was a real “Jack-Jack in The Incredibles” situation. He was left with babysitters (including the old, matronly comics version of Agatha Harkness) and joined kid superhero teams like The Power Pack, but never really affected the grand scheme of the universe aside from the occasional team-up with his parents, his uncle Johnny, and his godfather Ben Grimm. 

That changed in a very pronounced way in 2009, when writer Jonathan Hickman took over story duties on the ongoing Fantastic Four comic book series. One of the most important writers at Marvel over the last two decades, Hickman's runs on the company's key titles are characterized by grand-scale storytelling, tremendous attention to detail, and paradigm shifts for both individual characters and the Marvel Universe as a whole. And given the clues we have in the MCU so far—Thanos' henchmen in Avengers: Infinity War were Hickman's idea, to name just one example, as was the most recent incarnation of Marvel's Secret Wars—his work is a key inspiration for what's coming in the films.

Hickman's three-year run with Fantastic Four and its spin-off title, FF, was an ambitious effort to refine and boost the team's status, and set up events that would continue in Hickman's run on Avengers/New Avengers in 2012 and culminate in his 2015 Secret Wars crossover event. This massive macro-story touched on every aspect of Fantastic Four and Marvel Comics lore, and among many other things, it redefined Franklin's place in the multiverse.

Though he was always seen as a powerful child prodigy, Franklin became even more important under Hickman, who devised a cross-time story in which an older Franklin from the future returned to the present to help his child self refine and strengthen his powers. And, as his resurrection powers in First Steps suggest, Franklin's got a lot of potential. He has immense psionic abilities, including familiar stuff like telekinesis and the ability to generate powerful energy blasts, but more importantly, he can reorganize and reshape matter into basically anything he wants. He's initially classified as a mutant, and eventually his powers are assessed as so great that calling him “Omega-level,” like Magneto and Apocalypse, doesn't really begin to cover it. 

During the Hickman era, Franklin practices his matter-altering powers to such an extent that he's able to create pocket universes and draw the eye of Galactus, who sees Franklin as his heir. As the new film implies, Galactus is the last survivor of what's known in Marvel lore as the “Seventh Cosmos,” the most recent universe that was compressed and obliterated by what we know as The Big Bang. He's literally the last man standing from a whole multiverse, and Hickman's Fantastic Four reveals that Franklin is destined to succeed him as the survivor of the current multiverse when it finally goes boom. He's just that powerful and that important. 

Then we get to the elements that don't just tie to what has happened thus far in the MCU, but what seems to predict its direction moving forward. During Hickman's Secret Wars, the basis for the upcoming Avengers film following Doomsday, Franklin, his sister Valeria (who has powers of her own), and his mother are taken by Doctor Doom, the new God-Emperor of what's left of the cosmos, and adopted as his own family. Doom rules over Battleworld, a hodgepodge of all the surviving Marvel multiverse characters and worlds. No one has any memory of what came before, until a group of surviving superheroes (including Reed Richards) begins to reveal the truth. 

In a final battle, Doom is defeated, and Reed sets out to rebuild the Marvel multiverse world by world, universe by universe. And he does this, in part, through Franklin's ability to generate entire universes, whole cloth. When the dust settles on Secret Wars, that baby from The Fantastic Four: First Steps is the one who puts everyone's favorite characters back where they belong, resetting things for the Ninth Cosmos (the one destroyed by Secret Wars was the Eighth) and restoring a version of the status quo to Marvel Comics.

Is this exactly what will happen in the MCU? In The Fantastic Four: First Steps alone, Franklin is named by Galactus as his heir, uses his powers to bring his mother back from the dead, and, in a mid-credits scene, is clearly of interest to Doom and his larger plan, whatever that plan may be. It's early days for the character, but keep a close eye on Franklin Richards. That kid's going places.

Longtime HGTV star Ben Napier is finally getting some relief years after first injuring his ankle, which his wife and “Home Town” co-star Erin Napier says has since been “eaten up with arthritis.” The couple and their kids — daughters Helen, 7, and Mae, 4 — just returned from a summer 2025 trip to Scotland, where she said hiking was particularly “rough” for Ben.

Although Ben's orthopedist recommended surgery, Erin posted on July 29, 2025, that her big brother — physical therapist Clark Rasberry — has found success with a treatment called stemwave that has drastically reduced Ben's pain. 

Captioning a video of Rasberry treating his brother-in-law, Erin wrote, “stemwave is a thing that exists and it's somehow actually helping @scotsman.co's ankle he destroyed playing basketball years ago. his ortho doc says he needs an ankle replacement it's so eaten up with arthritis now, but my big brother and this magic machine at @optimal_performance_pt has taken his pain from a 12 to a 4. WHAT IS THIS VOODOO? have yall heard of this? ps. not sponsored, just amazed”

A post shared by Erin Napier (@erinapier)

In addition to the video of Rasberry working on Ben at his Optimal Performance physical therapy practice — based in their hometown of Laurel, Mississippi — Erin included 2011 photos of Ben's swollen and bruised ankle. 

StemWave is a relatively new non-invasive modality, according to the StemWave website, featuring an “electrohydraulic system that sends focused waves to activate connective tissue, relieve minor aches and pains and temporarily increase localized blood circulation.”

When one of Erin's followers asked how Ben handled hiking in Scotland, she replied, “9 mile hike was ROUGH on that ankle. he had his first stemwave session the week after we got home and he can't get over how it's helping”

Replying to another fan curious about Ben's treatments, Erin wrote, “his treatment plan is twice a week for 6 weeks”

Ben shared Erin's post in his Instagram Stories on July 29 and wrote, “It is amazing. I cannot brag enough.”

A post shared by Erin Napier (@erinapier)

This is not the first time Ben has seen his brother-in-law for physical therapy. In January 2023, Rasberry helped Ben with ongoing shoulder pain that had been bothering him for years. Ben did have rotator cuff surgery that spring, but was able to prepare for it and heal well afterwards with physical therapy. 

Erin shared on social media at the time that she loved attending his physical therapy sessions because it gave her a chance to see her brother, who followed in their dad's footsteps. She wrote at the time that Rasberry “was brave enough to step out in faith and left the hospital where our dad retired from to became a partner in a physical therapy clinic last year.” 

“I can't tell you what a wonder physical therapy is if you've never seen its effectiveness,” she continued. “The way my brother knows what exercises can heal an injury is like a kind of magic. Like seeing daddy do his work as a young man all over again. Maybe y'all are sentimental about a family profession too? I've always loved that the men in mine know how to heal people with their hands.”

Erin paid tribute to her dad and his profession on Instagram when he retired in 2019, writing, “Every girl loves and is proud of her daddy I suppose, but mine is extra special. For 44 years he has been helping people learn to walk again, or how to play sports again, or how to begin a new life after major surgery.”

With two decades of experience, Erin's brother joined Optimal Performance Physical Therapy in December 2021, according to the clinic's Instagram account.

James Cameron is at the point in his legendary career that he is not making decisions on box office returns but rather, just what feels “fun” to do. The auteur already explained why he thinks his “Ghosts of Hiroshima” adaptation will be his lowest grossing film ever (the epic will be made more out of moral obligation than for financial reasons), and has his third “Avatar” film, titled “Avatar: Fire And Ash,” set for a December 2025 theatrical release. Oh, and a Billie Eilish 3D concert film might be on the way…

It's only right that Cameron, too, gets to unwind with a lighter passion project here and there, and the director told Empire that his soon-to-be adaptation of the fantasy novel “The Devils” will be just that. Cameron previously announced in June 2025 that his company, Lightstorm Entertainment, has acquired the rights to the new book by author and screenwriter Joe Abercrombie; Cameron will co-write the screen adaptation.

“I was literally reading parts of the book out loud to my wife Suzy,” Cameron told Empire of first encountering the novel. “And it dawned on me: ‘I like this book so much, I should just buy it.'”

 










He added of “The Devils” that the plot is wild, saying, “The whole thing is off its tits. It's nuts.” 

The project will be a different kind of undertaking for Cameron, too: “It doesn't have the kind of conscience that ‘Avatar' does, but I don't know if that's a bad thing. [‘Hiroshima'] is a movie you do because you have to. ‘The Devils' is a movie you do for fun,” he said. 

Cameron previously said in a press statement that “The Devils” is a “sharply witty horror adventure” crossed with a “twisted, stylish, alt-universe middle-ages romp.”

“'The Devils' showcases [author] Joe's jaundiced view of human nature, in all its dark, selfish glory, as told through some decidedly un-human characters,” Cameron said. “But of course, Joe always teases with the flickers of redemption that make it all worthwhile — and ultimately quite heart-wrenching. I've loved Joe's writing for years, cherishing each new read, throughout the epic cycle of the ‘First Law' books, especially ‘Best Served Cold' (LOVE IT!) and the ‘Age of Madness' trilogy. But the freshness of the world and the characters in ‘The Devils' finally got me off my butt to buy one of his books and partner with him to bring it to the screen. I'm looking forward to the writing process with him, though I'm certain this adaptation will practically write itself because Joe writes very visually, almost in scenes, and with a very cinematic structure. I can't wait to dig into this as I wind down on ‘Avatar: Fire and Ash.' It will be a joyful new challenge for me to bring these indelible characters to life.”

In writer/director Michael Shanks‘ “Together,” Alison Brie and Dave Franco play Millie and Tim, a couple who are tested by a supernatural encounter that severely tests their relationship — and their bodies — via some terrifying transformations. It's a fascinating meditation on codependency given an extra bit of frisson by the fact that Brie and Franco are married; the movie plays like their “Eyes Wide Shut” as another haunting study of a romance under pressure acted out by a real-life couple.

It also has a strong element of body horror reminiscent of David Cronenberg, a director both Brie and Franco consider a favorite. In fact, long before they ever read the “Together” script, they took a deep dive into Cronenberg's work during the pandemic. “During COVID we would choose directors and just go down that path,” Franco told IndieWire of his and Brie's nightly movie viewing.

Brie added that although she's always been a film lover, Franco's influence has made her more appreciative of the horror genre. “I feel like Dave is my film school when it comes to offbeat independent films that I haven't heard of, and a lot of horror movies,” she told IndieWire. “I'd watch a horror movie every night if I could,” Franco added.

 










Though Brie considers “Dead Ringers” to be her favorite Cronenberg movie — and possibly her favorite body horror movie, period — she and Franco saw “Together” being a film in the tradition of the film Cronenberg made right before “Dead Ringers,” his 1986 remake of “The Fly.” “‘The Fly' is one of the best movies ever,” Franco said. “I'm not saying we're anywhere near that, but like that movie this is body horror with a romance at its core.” 

Although Brie and Franco immediately recognized the potential “Together” had for Cronenbergian body horror, when they read the script they had no idea how Shanks planned to execute the complicated set pieces he had written. “We were so drawn to it because of how unique and bold it was, but at the same time we were like, ‘How is he going to pull this off?,'” Franco said.

After Shanks showed Brie and Franco his short film “Rebooted” and explained his visual effects background they started to feel more relaxed, but not too relaxed — that would have been an impossibility given the 21-day schedule during which the filmmakers had to realize their ambitious vision. “Every single day there were either heavy prosthetics or crazy action sequences,” Franco said. “We were sprinting.”

According to Brie, the fast pace had the paradoxical effect of improving the performances, as everyone operated on pure instinct and fully committed at each moment. “I've never felt more free than I did on this movie,” she said. “There was no time to overthink. There was no time to be precious about performance. And the script was so fun and we trusted each other so much that we were able to truly throw ourselves into every take.”

 










The short schedule also gave Brie and Franco the inspiration to throw themselves into the more physically demanding aspects of the roles. “We could not have sustained that level for a three-month shoot,” Brie said, with Franco adding, “We wouldn't have survived! But because it was such a short schedule it gave us this mentality of, let's go for it every day, even if we're going to get a little bit injured and it's going to be insane.”

Brie noted that “Together” is essentially a monster movie where the monster lives in the characters' own bodies, meaning she and Franco were constantly slamming themselves around on set and coming home bruised and battered. “We're the kind of actors where that's our favorite part of it,” she said. “It's a very ‘put me in, coach' kind of energy.” “We were just so excited with the footage we were getting,” Franco added. “That gave us the momentum and fuel to get over the physical injuries.”

Brie and Franco also found that being a married couple made the shoot far easier than it would have been with other scene partners. “ There turned out to be endless benefits, even more so than we realized,” Brie said. “I felt like so much of the work on the history of this couple was already done just by our history and knowing that we have a base of love between us. Even when the couple is in distress, we knew that baseline would exist for them, and that was really helpful.”

 










 ”And this is a very simple thing, but the fact that we were living together meant we could rehearse as much as we wanted,” Franco said. “We could come to set every day and hit the ground running, knowing we have just one or two takes.” “We could discuss any performance things the night before,” Brie said, “and we had a great shorthand together that just saved a lot of time.”

In spite of the physical and emotional challenges of the material, Brie and Franco said there was no downside to playing a dysfunctional couple on screen. “I wish we could give you something, but the very annoying answer is that it really was pretty joyful,” Franco said. “ We did go into the whole process thinking, okay, this is a really intense undertaking that is either going to end in divorce, or we're gonna be more codependent than ever. And luckily it's the latter.”

“Together” opens in theaters on Wednesday, July 30 from Neon.

Timothée Chalamet is stepping in front of the camera — and behind the wheel — as the new brand ambassador for Lucid, the award-winning electric vehicle company best known for its sleek “Lucid Air” sedan and “Gravity” SUV.


	Chalamet's appointment as Lucid's Global Brand Ambassador was accompanied by a series of teaser images promoting his upcoming campaign for the Lucid Gravity, the automaker's all-electric SUV that first rolled off production lines last fall.


	The new photos see Chalamet posing with a 2026 Lucid Gravity Grand Touring in an “Aurora Green” finish, against a stark desert backdrop that harks back to the actor's performances in Dune (the two-time Oscar nominee is currently filming Dune: Part Three, directed by Denis Villeneuve). Dressed in a leather biker jacket over a simple white T-shirt and black pants, Chalamet channels an approachable luxury vibe that compliments Lucid's brand ethos — the company bills itself as a car marker that merges “best-in-class performance [and] sophisticated design with unrivaled energy efficiency. Indeed, the Lucid Air Grand Touring currently boasts the longest range of any electric vehicle on the market, with more than 500 miles on a single charge. 




	Unlike many young Hollywood stars, Chalamet doesn't often appear in brand campaigns and this is his first partnership in the automotive space. The actor and style savant was previously named a “Friend of the House” for Cartier, and appeared in campaigns for Chanel as the face of the fashion brand's Bleu de Chanel fragrance. The new Lucid role does appear to be an organic fit: the actor was first spotted driving a Lucid Air in 2023 while tailing girlfriend Kylie Jenner out of his Beverly Hills house. He's since been spotted multiple times out and about in his EV.




	Lucid calls Chalamet an ideal partner for the brand, noting that the relationship is “rooted in the belief that performance, design, and passion are key to creating exceptional experiences.”


	“We're excited to welcome Timothée as our first Global Brand Ambassador,” says Akerho “AK” Oghoghomeh, Senior Vice President of Marketing at Lucid Motors. “He brings together the same fearless creativity and uncompromising vision that defines our brand, embodying what it means to compromise nothing, both on and off screen. Together, we'll show what's possible when innovation and cultural relevance come together to move the world forward.”




	Lucid's full campaign starring Chalamet will debut later this year. The multi-year partnership is expected to include other activations and campaigns, with details to be revealed in the months to come.




	$5.96




	Lucid is set to celebrate ten years under its “Lucid Motors” banner next fall. The car maker's parent company, Atieva, was founded in 2007, with a focus on battery technology, but it was rebranded as Lucid in 2016.

Lucinda Williams is opening her own bar, and, no, it's not in Nashville. Rather, the Americana grand dame is bringing country music and honky-tonk vibes to New York's East Village with “Lucinda's,” making its official debut on Thursday at 169 Avenue A.


	Ahead of the public opening, Williams will perform an intimate concert on Tuesday night to be livestreamed on SiriusXM's Outlaw Country channel beginning at 9 p.m. ET. Laura Cantrell will open with her own set, and the Honky Tonkin' in Queens DJs — Moonshine and Prison Rodeo — will spin records.


	Williams is credited as a “co-founder” of Lucinda's in a press release. According to the release, the bar, located in the building that once housed storied rock club Brownie's and, most recently, Coney Island Baby and Lola, will be overseen by Laura McCarthy and Kelley Swindall. “We are really excited to have a down-home, honky tonk country bar in the East Village,” McCarthy said. “There is some kind of magic for music in that location. I have felt it since we opened Brownies in the late 80s. It's exciting to do this with Lucinda and the team.” 

	











	Lucinda's will feature weekly bluegrass nights, songwriter open mics, and live country music every Friday and Saturday night. The last Thursday of every month will be designated as the East Village Cxntry Club, an all-inclusive queer country party.

	While the venue is a tribute to Williams' hard-won career, it also pays homage to the late Jeremy Tepper, a friend of Williams and the brains behind SiriusXM's Outlaw Country.

	











	Williams' most recent album of original material was 2023's Stories From a Rock n Roll Heart. Last year, she released a record of Beatles songs she recorded at Abbey Road studios. She'll kick off August with three appearances on the Outlaw Music Festival tour with Willie Nelson and Bob Dylan.

On a recent episode of Supernatural Confrontations with L.A. Marzulli, two courageous women recounted their remarkable experiences with the supernatural realm. 

Heidi, a born-again Christian and mother of two, described a surreal early-morning encounter in 2018 while living in Bradenton, Florida. She awoke to a strange cold sensation and, peering down the hallway toward her children's bedroom, witnessed what she described as a towering “tin soldier” standing guard over her son's doorway. “He was literally just in shining silver armor. The face was covered with a helmet… a big circular shield… I couldn't see a face,” she said. His legs straddled the doorway—he had to have been 14 to 16 feet tall.

Initially terrified, Heidi then heard a calm, male voice tell her, “Look again.” When she did, the figure remained motionless. “It all looked like it had just always been there,” she said. Though the experience lasted only seconds, it was seared into her memory. “I was so shook up about it, but so excited,” she said. Her children believed it was their guardian angel—and Marzulli agreed, describing it as a moment of “hyper-dimensionality” where the spiritual realm intersected with the physical.

Leslie's encounter was more intense—a full-on spiritual confrontation during a stormy night in Kentucky in 2013. After being warned not to go outside, she disobeyed, only to have her storm door violently slam shut. That's when she saw it: a massive hand—“almost like a hologram”—overlaid on hers. She looked up and saw “a huge man, very, very, very strong… in armor… and on his shoulder was the head of an eagle.” He told her firmly, “Don't go outside again.”

Moments later, the spiritual atmosphere grew darker. Leslie began praying as shadowy demonic figures swarmed outside her home. “Dozens of them… crawling all over the outside of my home, pounding on the walls, the windows, the roof—everything—trying to get in,” she recalled. In desperation, she called out to God. “Lord, come speedily to my aid,” she cried, quoting Psalm 70. Then, in a vision, she saw the night sky open with concentric rings of clouds, “like a telescope,” as angels poured through to engage in heavenly warfare.

The moment the angels descended, peace returned. “The house was calm. Everything was fine,” she said. Though family members remembered the shaking, they had no recollection of the spiritual battle unfolding around them.

These testimonies serve as sobering reminders of a hidden war that rages beyond human perception. As Marzulli affirmed, “The supernatural world is extremely real. It's as close as the air between your fingers.”

Republicans across the country are working hard to pass bills banning something that the fringe corners of the internet told them to be afraid of: weather modification.

Weather modification refers to geoengineering processes such as solar radiation modification and cloud-seeding that are used to counter the effects of global warming and drought, respectively. These processes have been woven into right-wing conspiracy theories that the government is able to control the weather, and MAGA lawmakers—fearful that the Democrats could rule the heavens and summon a deluge to wipe them out—have started to take action. 

Republican lawmakers in nearly 20 states have introduced legislation to prevent weather modification. Some of the laws allude to “chemtrails,” a conspiracy theory that planes aren't leaving “contrails” of condensation in the atmosphere but are spreading chemicals on an unsuspecting public. In two states, Florida and Tennessee, those bills have passed and been signed into law. 

In July, right-wing concerns about weather modification reached a new fever pitch.

Earlier this month, Environmental Protection Agency head Lee Zeldin announced an effort to “compile everything we know about contrails and geoengineering” and release it to the public.

Days later, Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene and Tim Burchett introduced the Clear Skies Act, a bill that would levy steep penalties for anyone who “knowingly conducts weather modification,” including geoengineering, cloud seeding, solar radiation modification, and the release of aerosol to “influence temperature, precipitation, or the intensity of sunlight.” 

After Hurricane Helene struck the southeast United States in October, Greene boosted the right-wing conspiracy theory that the Biden administration had used weather manipulation to target Republican areas ahead of the U.S. general election. “Yes they can control the weather,” Greene wrote in a post on X at the time. “It's ridiculous for anyone to lie and say it can't be done.” 

The theory of weather control is not only outrageously anti-science but based on an explicitly antisemitic conspiracy theory—though that's something Greene has never shied away from in the past. In fact, she added to the conspiracy theory with her now-infamous “Jewish space lasers” comment.

Greene isn't actually worried about manmade impact on the environment; after all, she's got no problems with fossil fuels. Rather, she's latched onto conspiracy theories about how weather can be controlled by those in power. Meanwhile, Greene said she saw a kind of “funny hypocrisy” from the environmentalists who oppose pollution but not weather manipulation.

In interviews, Greene and Burchett said that the impetus for their legislation was concerns of constituents. Burchett admitted that the issue “was in the realm of the conspiracy theorists” but had “taken on a little bit more mainstream.”

“You have one group that says it's real, and the other group says, ‘You're a lunatic,' that it doesn't exist,” he said.

“If it doesn't exist,” Burchett added, “then you don't have anything to worry about.”

While weather modification does exist, it can't be weaponized as Greene has implied. Several states have programs for cloud seeding—a decades-old technology that helps to induce rain—including California, Nevada, Idaho, Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, and North Dakota.","{'href': 'https://www.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Home'}","other"

			Radio 4's investigation into this secretive home-schooling network soon unearths red flags

Even the most rational, evidence-based person has at least one conspiracy theory that they secretly harbour. Mine is that conspiracy theorists who rail against the establishment and the “deep state” are actually deep-state actors working for the establishment. How can they not be? They are so abject at promoting their own cause, so effective at driving even the most conspiracy-curious back into the comforting embrace of Big Brother, that some of them surely must be plants.

So it was with We Are Not a Conspiracy School (Radio 4, Tuesday), an investigation by documentary-maker Darryl Morris into the Hope Sussex Community – the title of the programme tells you the accusation that the home-schooling network/community hub/“group of like-minded people” is facing.

Set up during the pandemic by former BNP activists Matt and Sadie Single, along with former West End performer Katy-Jo Murfin, Hope Sussex is intended to be an alternative to mainstream education. Hope stands for “Home of Positive Energy”.

Morris, admirably, wanted to get beyond the lurid headlines about anti-vax crackpots teaching children to fight back against the British state and 9/11 being introduced to impressionable young minds as an inside job. He managed to secure a rare interview with Murfin and the Singles and found three friendly, personable people with deep and understandable reservations about the British education system.

A single frazzled 20-something teacher trying to give gold-standard education to a class of 30-plus children with complex individual needs? What parent wouldn't want to take their child out of the bear pit of sensory overload that is the modern British school, especially if that child is visibly struggling?

The trio behind Hope Sussex made many strong points – children should be taught to research not regurgitate, critical thinking should be promoted above rote learning – yet Morris did not have to push too hard to keep finding red flags.

Morris had a cold when he arrived at the interview, but Murfin and the Singles chortled that “they didn't believe in viruses”. Murfin talked eloquently about the benefits of homeschooling, before quoting David Icke and talking about “totalitarian tiptoe”. When Morris brought up 9/11, Matt launched into a long-debunked theory about the temperature at which steel melts. Schools, he said, teach “sexual degradation”.

They are, they insist, teaching all theories, not just the ones accepted by the mainstream, and as such are raising children who are open-minded, questioning and shrewd. Yet it is very clear which rigid world-view they are passing on to their children – one of paranoia, of not trusting any media or politician, of believing that government is a nefarious force.

A glance at their social media shows recent events at Hope Sussex include talks by Kate Shemirani, the “natural health” advocate and struck-off nurse whose daughter Paloma refused treatment for her cancer and died months later, and a festival sponsored by the conspiracy theory website UK Column (“The Antidote to Mainstream Propaganda”). Matt calls the pandemic a “plandemic”.

Murfin and Sadie might want to encourage Matt away from media opportunities in future. When they spoke warmly of needing somewhere to educate their children, somewhere with outside space, Matt dived in: “Our space, where you can lock the gates and, ‘[others] are not permitted here'. Any kind of authority. We are raising our children as we see fit, you are not welcome or wanted.”

Morris, like every other outsider, was not allowed on the grounds of Hope Sussex. Outside are CCTV cameras and signs warning off trespassers. “It's overwhelming, sometimes, the sense of love and selflessness that comes from people in the community,” said Sadie. We'll have to take her word for it. Unavoidably, at times, they sounded like a cult.

The great sadness is that they have a point. We shouldn't passively accept everything our government does, we shouldn't live a life devoid of individual thought and research. And our education system is at breaking point. How wonderful it would be if “like-minded people” in the UK were able to do something to change that, to create an innovative school system that worked for everyone. If our only other option is Hope Sussex, however, I am mainstream brainwashing all the way.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) yesterday raised its global growth forecast as efforts to circumvent US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs sparked a bigger-than-expected surge in trade, while the US president stepped back from some of his harshest threats.

But the IMF still sees growth slowing this year, even as it lifted its projection to 3.0 percent -- up from 2.8 percent in April -- in its World Economic Outlook update.

Last year, global growth came in at 3.3 percent.

Looking ahead, the IMF expects the world economy to expand 3.1 percent next year, an improvement from the 3.0 percent it earlier predicted.

Despite the upward revisions, “there are reasons to be very cautious,” IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas told AFP.

“Businesses were trying to frontload, move stuff around, before the tariffs were imposed, and so that's supporting economic activity,” he said.

“There is going to be payback for that. If you stock the shelves now, you don't need to stock them later in the year or into the next year,” he added.

This means a likelihood of reduced trade activity in the second half of the year, and into next year.

“The global economy has continued to hold steady, but the composition of activity points to distortions from tariffs, rather than underlying robustness,” the IMF's report said.

Since returning to the White House, Trump has imposed a 10 percent levy on almost all trading partners and steeper duties on autos, steel and aluminum.

But he paused higher tariffs on dozens of economies until Aug. 1, a significant delay from April when they were first unveiled.

Washington and Beijing also agreed to lower for 90 days triple-digit duties on each other's goods, in a pause set to expire on Aug. 12, although talks that could lead to a further extension of the truce are ongoing. 

Trump's actions so far have brought the US effective tariff rate to 17.3 percent, significantly above the 3.5 percent level for the rest of the world, the IMF said.

Among major economies, US growth this year was revised 0.1 percentage points up, to 1.9 percent, with tariff rates anticipated to settle at lower levels than initially announced in April.

The US economy is also set to see a near-term boost from Trump's flagship tax and spending bill.

Growth for the euro area was adjusted 0.2 percentage points higher to 1.0 percent, but this partially reflected a jump in Irish pharmaceutical exports to the US to avoid fresh duties.

Among European economies, Germany is still expected to avoid contraction while forecasts for France and Spain remained unchanged at 0.6 percent and 2.5 percent respectively.

While the IMF anticipates global inflation to keep declining, with headline inflation cooling to 4.2 percent this year, it warned that price increases will remain above above target in the US.

“The tariffs, acting as a supply shock, are expected to pass through to US consumer prices gradually and hit inflation in the second half of 2025,” the IMF report said.

Elsewhere, Trump's duties “constitute a negative demand shock, lowering inflationary pressures,” the report added.

Growth in the world's number two economy China, however, was revised sharply upwards by 0.8 percentage points to 4.8 percent.

This reflects stronger-than-expected activity in the first half of this year, alongside “the significant reduction in US-China tariffs,” the IMF said.

But Gourinchas warned that China is still experiencing headwinds, with “fairly weak” domestic demand.

“There is relatively little consumer confidence, the property sector is still a black spot in the Chinese economy, it's not been completely addressed,” he added. “And that is resulting in a drag on economic activity going forward.”

Japan remains in a slow-growth rut and is expected to eke an expansion of just 0.7 percent this year and 0.5 percent next, the IMF said.

India is once again expected to be the world's fastest-growing major economy, expanding a forecast 6.4 percent this year and next, it said.

Meanwhile, Trump's protectionism is buffeting global commerce. The IMF upgraded its forecast for growth in world trade, measured by volume, to 2.6 percent this year. That is up from the 1.7 percent it had predicted in April and reflects a surge in shipments as exporters tried to beat the tariff crunch. 

But eventually the higher US levies are expected to take a toll. The IMF sees trade growing just 1.9 percent next year, down from the 2.5 percent it had forecast in April.

ELECTRONICS BOOST:
                                        A predicted surge in exports would likely be driven by ICT products, exports of which have soared 84.7 percent from a year earlier, DBS said                                        DBS Bank Ltd (星展銀行) yesterday raised its GDP growth forecast for Taiwan this year to 4 percent from 3 percent, citing robust demand for artificial intelligence (AI)-related exports and accelerated shipment activity, which are expected to offset potential headwinds from US tariffs.
“Our GDP growth forecast for 2025 is revised up to 4 percent from 3 percent to reflect front-loaded exports and strong AI demand,” Singapore-based DBS senior economist Ma Tieying (馬鐵英) said in an online briefing.
Taiwan's second-quarter performance beat expectations, with GDP growth likely surpassing 5 percent, driven by a 34.1 percent year-on-year increase in exports, Ma said, citing government                                    


SMART MANUFACTURING: 
                                        The company aims to have its production close to the market end, but attracting investment is still a challenge, the firm's president said                                        Delta Electronics Inc (台達電) yesterday said its long-term global production plan would stay unchanged amid geopolitical and tariff policy uncertainties, citing its diversified global deployment.
With operations in Taiwan, Thailand, China, India, Europe and the US, Delta follows a “produce at the market end” strategy and bases its production on customer demand, with major site plans unchanged, Delta president Simon Chang (張訓海) said on the sidelines of a company event yesterday.
Thailand would remain Delta's second headquarters, as stated in its first-quarter earnings conference, with its plant there adopting a full smart manufacturing system, Chang said. 
Thailand is the firm's second-largest overseas                                    


‘REMARKABLE SHOWING': 
                                        The economy likely grew 5 percent in the first half of the year, although it would likely taper off significantly, TIER economist Gordon Sun said                                        The Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER) yesterday raised Taiwan's GDP growth forecast for this year to 3.02 percent, citing robust export-driven expansion in the first half that is likely to give way to a notable slowdown later in the year as the front-loading of global shipments fades.
The revised projection marks an upward adjustment of 0.11 percentage points from April's estimate, driven by a surge in exports and corporate inventory buildup ahead of possible US tariff hikes, TIER economist Gordon Sun (孫明德) told a news conference in Taipei.
Taiwan's economy likely grew more than 5 percent in the first six months                                    


SUPPLY RESILIENCE:
                                        The extra expense would be worth it, as the US firm is diversifying chip sourcing to avert disruptions similar to the one during the pandemic, the CEO said                                        Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) chief executive officer Lisa Su (蘇姿丰) on Wednesday said that the chips her company gets from supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC, 台積電) would cost more when they are produced in TSMC's Arizona facilities.

A separate poll has found that Americans' support for Israel's genocide has hit an all-time low.

Zohran Mamdani's staunch support for Palestinian rights was a major boon to his campaign and served as one of the top motivations for voters to cast their ballot for him, new polling finds, providing evidence that opposing Israel's genocide in Gaza is a winning position as establishment Democrats scratch their heads over Mamdani's historic campaign and popularity.

Polling out Tuesday by the IMEU Policy Project and Data for Progress found that 62 percent of voters who cast a ballot for Mamdani said that his support for Palestinian rights swayed their vote. This includes a whopping 83 percent of new voters who said as such, the poll found.

This made Palestinian rights the third-most important reason to back Mamdani among those who voted for him, only ranking behind his proposals to lower costs for everyday Americans and to tax the wealthy and take on corporations.​

The polling additionally found that New York primary voters overwhelmingly oppose Israel's assault, with 78 percent saying that Israel is committing a genocide; 79 percent saying that they support restricting weapons shipments to Israel; and 63 percent saying that they would support the mayor arresting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he visits the city, as Mamdani has pledged to do.

The poll results vastly undercut claims by establishment Democrats that Israel's genocide in Gaza doesn't matter to the electorate, or that supporting Palestinian rights would be unpopular. Since Mamdani's win, establishment New York Democrats have refused to endorse Mamdani, instead trying and failing to drum up controversy over the phrase “globalize the intifada,” which he never said. 

Democrats, who have spent millions on trying to rehabilitate their image, are flailing in trying to come up with any explanation but Mamdani's democratic socialist stances for his win. Just on Monday, for instance, Pete Buttigieg — a potential contender for the 2028 Democratic presidential nominee — said that it wasn't Mamdani's ideology, but rather his campaign strategies that delivered his win. 

“I think if my party wants to learn lessons from Mamdani's success that are portable to a place like Michigan, where I live, it's less about the ideology and more about the message discipline of focusing on what people care about,” Buttigieg said.

The polling shows that Buttigieg is flat-out wrong, with voters ranking Mamdani's social media presence, ads, and canvassing campaign the lowest among their reasons for voting for him. Many critics of the party on the left have noted that the Democratic Party's cratering popularity is, in large part, caused by the instinct of people like Buttigieg to oppose the left, even if it means losing or teaming up with the far right.

Ignoring Gaza specifically has been shown, in fact, to be a losing position for Democrats. A YouGov poll found earlier this year that the Gaza genocide was the top reason for not voting in the 2024 presidential election among those who didn't cast a ballot, proving a major contribution to Kamala Harris's embarrassing loss to Donald Trump.

Some conservatives have tried to dismiss Mamdani's win as a fluke, only possible in a heavily blue place like New York City. But the lesson on the popularity of pro-Palestine stances is relevant nationwide as well, other polling has shown. 

New polling released Tuesday by Gallup finds that support for Israel's genocide in Gaza has hit a new low in the U.S., with now less than a third of Americans, 32 percent, saying they back it. This is a 10 point drop since the last time Gallup polled this question in September. In fact, now, a majority of voters say they disapprove, at 60 percent — with disapproval winning out by a 28-point margin.

This poll was largely conducted before Israel's starvation campaign made headlines last week, meaning that the difference could be even starker now.

Democrats seeking higher turnout or more support should take note, with Gallup finding that now only 8 percent of Democratic voters support the genocide, down from 36 percent in October 2023.

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

Bitcoin — once warily regarded as the domain of chumps and criminals — can now buy you a house. 

One of the world's largest luxury brokerages just launched a division solely dedicated to digital currency transactions. 

Christie's International Real Estate, known for its global portfolio and luxury clientele, shared the news with the New York Times this week. Its newly minted team of lawyers, analysts and crypto experts is expected to meet a growing demand for all-crypto real estate deals.

The bold move marks a first among major real estate firms.

Aaron Kirman, CEO of a Christie's affiliate in Los Angeles, is spearheading the new division. Kirman has handled high-profile listings like the estates of Rodney Dangerfield and Cary Grant, as well as the former home of Yolanda Hadid and Kiley Jenner. 

Kirman told the Times that the crypto trend in real estate is “only going to get bigger over the next few years.”

While it's common practice for privacy-minded billionaires and celebrities to purchase properties behind anonymous shell corporations, even all-cash deals between iron-clad shell companies can be sleuthed out from time to time. Purchasing a home exclusively with cryptocurrency funds, rather than bank funds, essentially allows high-profile purchasers total anonymity. 

Real estate deals made with crypto remain rare, but lucrative. Kirman closed a handful of high-end crypto deals over the last two years, he told the Times, including a $65 million Beverly Hills home. 

Christie's crypto-ready portfolio is reportedly worth more than $1 billion. Invisible House in Joshua Tree, a desert home with a totally mirrored facade, is accepting cryptocurrency offers equivalent to $18 million. A Bel Air mansion, dubbed La Fin, is worth $118 million, and currently stands as the priciest-ever home listed for crypto.

Roughly 14% of American adults today own at least some cryptocurrency, according to a recent Gallup poll. Buying a home with crypto leaves big banks, and the potential for a home loan, out of the picture — for now.

President Trump's housing director, William Pulte, said in June he would instruct Fannie Mae and Freddie Mack to consider crypto assets as part of a homebuyer's loan application. Washington DC is increasingly embracing digital currency under the Trump administration.

Kirman told the Times he is in talks with big banks to pave the way for homebuyers who have cryptocurrency to spend, yet still require financing — a potentially major step for both the real estate and crypto industries.

Christie's did not respond to a request for further comment on the news.

Ether (ETH) is holding steady above $3,800, according to CoinDesk Data, as the battle for dominance among corporate ETH treasuries intensifies. 

On Tuesday, SharpLink Gaming (SBET) announced it had purchased an additional 77,210 ETH last week, worth nearly $290 million at an average price of $3,756. The move raises SharpLink's total ether holdings to 438,190 ETH, valued at roughly $1.69 billion.

The Minneapolis-based firm has now raised over $279 million in net proceeds during the week of July 21 through its at-the-market (ATM) equity facility. Since launching its ETH treasury strategy on June 2, SharpLink has aggressively ramped up purchases while generating a total of 722 ETH in staking rewards. The company also said its ETH concentration ratio — measuring total ETH held relative to fully diluted shares — has risen 70% since launch.

Despite SharpLink's surge, BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) still leads the ETH treasury race. 

The Las Vegas-based company announced on the same day that its total ETH holdings stand at 625,000 tokens, valued at $2.35 billion. BitMine also revealed a $1 billion open-ended share repurchase program, allowing it to buy back its own stock as a flexible alternative to acquiring additional ETH. Chairman Tom Lee said the move reflects “expected return calculus” as the company works toward its goal of controlling 5% of Ethereum's circulating supply.

The competition between the two firms has become a major subplot in ether's rise. 

Both companies aim to become the dominant ETH treasury in public markets, often mirroring strategies once common among bitcoin-focused firms like Strategy (previously MicroStrategy). Former BlackRock executive Joseph Chalom, now Co-CEO at SharpLink, emphasized the company's alignment with ether's long-term value proposition and its role in reshaping financial infrastructure.

Ether's price has remained remarkably resilient during a tense macroeconomic week. 

The Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision is due Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET, with no rate changes expected, though Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks may trigger volatility. Despite that uncertainty, ETH has climbed 56% in the past month as demand from ETFs and corporate treasuries outpaces new supply.

Trump's EPA Is Taking Aim at the Legal Backbone of U.S. Climate Policy

The Trump administration is releasing its proposal to undo the “endangerment finding,” the long-standing rationale and legal imperative for regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act

On Tuesday the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is set to release its proposal to undo its long-standing rationale and legal mandate to regulate greenhouse gases under the decades-old Clean Air Act—part of the Trump administration's wide-ranging campaign to dismantle federal efforts to combat climate change.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and other administration officials are slated to appear at an Indianapolis truck dealership, where they are expected to release a draft rule to undo this “endangerment finding,” which the EPA issued in 2009, along with a proposal to reverse vehicle tailpipe emissions limits enacted under President Joe Biden's term. The endangerment finding formally stated that carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases produced by the burning of fossil fuels “endanger the public health and public welfare of current and future generations” and so could be regulated under the Clean Air Act (alongside other pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and particulate matter). The finding is “the linchpin for everything—all of the carbon regulation under the Clean Air Act,” said Patrick Parenteau, now an emeritus professor of environmental law at Vermont Law School, in an interview with Scientific American in 2017, when the first Trump administration was also attempting to undo climate regulations.

During that first attempt, the EPA's then administrator Scott Pruitt did not try to jettison the endangerment finding and instead proposed weaker emissions regulations to replace those put in place under President Barack Obama. (The Trump regulations were themselves replaced with more stringent regulations under Biden as part of his pledge to reduce U.S. emissions by up to 66 percent by 2035.) But the second Trump administration is attempting to take a more permanent approach; rescinding the endangerment finding would make it harder for future administrations to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act without a specific law or amendment passed by Congress.

The endangerment finding came about because of a suit against the EPA brought by environmental groups and states during the administration of President George W. Bush. In that 2007 case, Massachusetts v. EPA, the Supreme Court ruled that greenhouse gases qualified as an “air pollutant” under the broad definition in the Clean Air Act: “any air pollution agent or combination of such agents, including any physical, chemical, biological, radioactive ... substance or matter, which is emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air.”

With the finding in place, the EPA cannot legally ignore climate change or completely strike greenhouse gas regulations from the books.

It is not yet clear exactly what basis the Trump administration will use to undo the endangerment finding. But based on comments officials made in March, when the EPA first announced it would reconsider the finding, the agency may cite what it deems a failure to consider the costs imposed by greenhouse gas regulation or the well-established scientific methods to combine and quantify the emissions of six different gases based on their heat-trapping potential. The latter measure is called “CO2 equivalent” and is used to express how much a molecule of a given gas can warm the atmosphere as compared with a molecule of CO2. For example, methane traps much more heat on a per-molecule basis than CO2 does, though CO2 lingers for much longer in the atmosphere.

Conservatives have long cited the costs imposed by regulations, though climate change itself poses considerable costs to the U.S. economy. Climate-change-fueled disasters alone cost the country $150 billion each year with the warming that has happened to date. Climate scientists are in clear agreement that, in order to avoid ever worsening disasters and disruptions to our societies, the world must rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And the U.S. is a major contributor to global emissions—though China is now the highest emitter each year, the U.S. is the biggest emitter historically and still emits more per capita than China does.

And failing to rein in emissions now will disproportionately affect future generations: a child born today will experience many times more heatwaves their parents or grandparents in their lifetimes.

Whatever way the EPA attempts to remove the endangerment finding, it will have to go through a formal rule-making process, which includes soliciting public comments. And any proposed change will be challenged in court. Historically the courts have upheld the endangerment finding, given the robust scientific evidence that climate change causes harm.

“Every major scientific society endorses the scientific consensus on human-caused climate change driven by GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions. The Fifth National Climate Assessment and the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report are two major recent authoritative summaries of peer-reviewed climate science, which show that the science on climate change has only become more dire and compelling since 2009,” wrote Rachel Cleetus, policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, in an April 9 blog post. “The impacts of climate change on human health are also starkly clear and backed by overwhelming evidence.”

YouTube on Tuesday announced it's beginning to roll out age-estimation technology in the U.S. to identify teen users in order to provide a more age-appropriate experience. The company says it will use a variety of signals to determine the users' possible age, regardless of what the user entered as their birthday when they signed up for an account.

When YouTube identifies a user as a teen, it introduces new protections and experiences, which include disabling personalized advertising, safeguards that limit repetitive viewing of certain types of content, and enabling digital well-being tools such as screen time and bedtime reminders, among others.

These protections already exist on YouTube, but have only been applied to those who verified themselves as teens, not those who may have withheld their real age. For instance, in 2023, YouTube began limiting repeated viewing of videos that could trigger body image issues or those that display social aggression. The company has also been developing digital well-being tools since 2018.

If the new system incorrectly identifies a user as under 18 when they are not, YouTube says the user will be given the option to verify their age with a credit card, government ID, or selfie. Only users who have been directly verified through this method or whose age has been inferred to be over 18 will be able to view the age-restricted content on the platform.

The machine learning-powered technology will begin to roll out over the next few weeks to a small set of U.S. users and will then be monitored before rolling out more widely, the company says. 

The plans to introduce age inference technology were announced in February as part of YouTube's 2025 roadmap. The plans are also the latest step in attempting to make YouTube safer for younger users, following the 2015 launch of the YouTube Kids app and the 2024 rollout of supervised accounts. The features also arrive as social media more broadly is coming under increased government scrutiny in the United States, where platform makers, including Apple and Google, have pitted their lobbyists against those from big tech companies like Meta over who's responsible for age verification and children's safety.

In the meantime, a handful of U.S. states have taken matters into their own hands, as over a dozen states have passed or proposed laws to regulate minors' use of social media. Many of these require age verification or parental consent, including those in Louisiana, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Utah, Texas, Maryland, Tennessee, and Connecticut, among others. (However, some laws, like those in Utah and Arkansas, are blocked by litigation at this time and are not enforceable, while others are still pending implementation.)

The U.K. also began enforcing its own age-verification checks this week following the 2023 passing of the Online Safety Act.

YouTube isn't sharing specifics about the signals it's using to infer a user's age, but notes that it will look at some data like the YouTube activity and the longevity of a user's account to make a determination if the user is under 18. 

The new system will apply only to signed-in users, as signed-out users already cannot access age-restricted content, and will be available across platforms, including web, mobile, and connected TV.

Carlos Alcaraz is preparing for a return to the hard courts following his loss in the 2025 Wimbledon final.

The Spaniard surrendered his Wimbledon title to his great rival Jannik Sinner, losing in four sets on Centre Court.

Following his visit to south London, Alcaraz confirmed he would miss the Canadian Open. The 22-year-old is one of a few high-profile names missing from the tournament, including Jack Draper, Jannik Sinner and Novak Djokovic.

As for the Cincinnati Open, Alcaraz has reached the final once before, losing to Novak Djokovic in a marathon three-set match in 2023. It is the only Masters 1000 final he has lost in eight appearances.

On Monday, the Spaniard was spotted training at the La Manga Club Resort in Spain, where he was working on two specific areas of his game in preparation for Cincinnati.

Carlos Alcaraz's all-court game is undisputed. The Spaniard has demonstrated extensive consistency on both groundstrokes, a competent serve, and an ability to mix in an effective drop-shot when required..

However, the Spaniard has been seen working on another area of his game ahead of the Cincinnati Open.

German Abril, a Spanish sports journalist, spotted Alcaraz at the La Manga Club Resort in Spain, revealing that the 22-year-old French Open champion was working on his net approaches and passing shots.

🎾 Completado un nuevo día de entrenamientos para Carlos Alcaraz en La Manga Club, hoy haciendo especial énfasis en las subidas a la red y passings. pic.twitter.com/uH4os2O2OC

On X [Twitter], Abril said: “Completed another day of training for Carlos Alcaraz at La Manga Club, today with a special focus on net approaches and passing shots.”

Alcaraz has few weaknesses, if any. His mastery of all facets on a tennis court is remarkable considering his age, and the fact that his best years are yet to come.

With an additional rest period following his withdrawal in Canada, Alcaraz will be well-rested and rejuvenated when taking a shot at claiming his first Cincinnati Open title.

It may be somewhat surprising to see Alcaraz working on his net approaches when considering his strong performances at the net during the French Open and Wimbledon finals.

However, this is the life of a professional tennis player. They must work on all areas of their game, even their strengths.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Piastri's Perfect Pass in Belgium

Radio Rewind: 2025 Belgian Grand Prix

Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz reflect on their races in Belgium, with the former able to score points for Williams at Spa-Francorchamps.

Alex Albon was left elated with a substantial points haul after finishing sixth in the Belgian Grand Prix, the Thai driver holding off Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton for much of the race in Spa.

However, it was mixed fortunes for Williams with Carlos Sainz unable to finish in the points despite doing so in the Sprint, instead having to settle for P18 at the end of a difficult day that began in the pit lane.

Albon was the Williams man to struggle in the Sprint, coming home a lowly 16th, but a strong Qualifying on Saturday afternoon saw him bag fifth on the grid, and while he lost a place to George Russell in the wet early on, Albon made it to the line in an impressive P6.

He also managed to keep a charging Hamilton behind for a big chunk of the race, despite the Ferrari man having DRS for lap after lap, and a car that looked strong in race trim. Sixth was Albon's best finish since Imola, so it was no surprise that he was left delighted with how his afternoon went.

“Very happy, it was not easy to hold off Lewis [Hamilton] and he gave me a lot of pressure for long parts of the race,” Albon explained.

“In some ways, a bit annoyed to have given a position up to George [Russell] but to be honest with you, I think we struggled a bit more in the wet than we do in the dry. Once we put the dry tyres on we were okay.

“I'm happy, I think we finished 12 seconds or so in front of the next midfield car which is a good statement of intent from us and shows our package was working well this weekend, so very happy.”

Albon has now scored points in nine of the 10 races he has finished this year – as well as putting to be a torrid run where he failed to finish in three consecutive races in Spain, Canada and Austria.

“It shows I think realistically that if we had finished every race, we would have scored points I think in nearly every race and that's a really good trait to have,” he continued.

“It means the DNA of the car is consistent and we are not peaking. I think we are the most consistent midfield team, and we can go to every weekend knowing we can score points as long as we can finish the race.”

Williams remain fifth in the standings, with a healthier margin to the rest of the midfield thanks to the points earned in Belgium. But despite that, the weekend proved a bittersweet one for Sainz, who did so well to score in the Sprint but had a race to forget on Sunday.

The Spaniard opted for a pit lane start after taking on some new power unit components, but despite starting ahead of Hamilton in the pit lane – the Ferrari man finishing seventh in the end – Sainz could only come home in P18 on a day where everything went wrong.

“Basically, our weekend was run after a bad Quali yesterday,” Sainz said. ""We did a bit of analysis after the bad Qualifying and we saw that we went in the wrong direction with the set-up, that probably cost me quite a bit in Quali.

“We also found an anomaly in the car throughout the weekend, so we said 'okay we are starting 15th, better we start 17th from the pit lane than 15th on the grid'.

""That allows us to change the anomaly, that allows us to change the set-up, that allows us to put a high downforce rear wing for the wet, as it looked like it was going to be wet. It wasn't wet, and we couldn't move forward.”

Sainz was not the only driver to gamble on a set-up that didn't prove optimal, on a day where the weather was incredibly difficult to predict. But that aside, the Spaniard remains frustrated with his up and down season, where every step forward seems to follow with another step backwards.

“I don't know if it is a matter of time, or I'm going to start to consider changing something bigger, to see if there is something that starts clicking a bit more,” he added.

“We had a super strong Sprint, a super strong Qualifying for the Sprint, super strong lap in Q1 and then suddenly we don't manage to improve and the weekend started to go south.

“I don't know, it is something I need to keep looking at, something I need to keep working on. Every weekend is a different thing so it is not like it is a pattern and, yeah, we are going to keep working hard at it and see what we can do in Hungary.”

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Piastri's Perfect Pass in Belgium

Radio Rewind: 2025 Belgian Grand Prix

Lewis Hamilton has come to the defence of Kimi Antonelli after a poor weekend at the Belgian Grand Prix.

Lewis Hamilton has come to the defence of Kimi Antonelli, claiming the young Italian is ""doing fantastic"" in his debut season of Formula 1 despite a recent bad run of form.

Antonelli joined Mercedes at the start of 2025 amidst plenty of hype after moving up following just one season of Formula 2 and replacing seven-time World Champion Hamilton after his move to Ferrari.

While the 18-year-old started his F1 career strongly, securing five points finishes in the first six races as well as a podium in Canada back in June, he has since come under increasing pressure due to a lack of results, having collided with Max Verstappen on the opening lap in Austria, which eliminated both, and non-scoring in Great Britain.

Antonelli endured a miserable weekend in Belgium, which included another non-score after failing to advance beyond the first stage of Qualifying for the Sprint and Grand Prix, the Italian appearing emotional in the media pen after the latter.

It's not the first time pressure has impacted Antonelli's performances on track, which included crashing on his F1 practice debut at the Italian Grand Prix last year amidst the hype.

He also admitted that he had burnt himself out ahead of the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix with commitments ahead of his home race this year.

Hamilton also failed to advance beyond SQ1 and Q1 in Belgium but made up 11 places in the Grand Prix to finish P7 and came to the defence of Antonelli post-race.

""I can't imagine what it's like at 18, or try to imagine what it's like at 18 to do what he's been doing,"" Hamilton told Sky Sports F1.

""I think he's been doing fantastic to be thrown in at the deep end at 18.

""He didn't even have his driving licence when he started racing, so I think it's a lot on someone's shoulders and I think he's doing a great job.

""He's got a great group of people around him. I think he's just got to take it in his stride, which I think he is and as I say, he's got Bono [Pete Bonnington, Hamilton's former race engineer] beside him, so he couldn't have anyone better.""

	It's been nearly three decades since Adam Sandler introduced us to Happy Gilmore, and audiences showed how much the Sandman and his beloved character still resonate following the record-breaking opening weekend of Happy Gilmore 2.


	According to the Netflix Top 10 released Tuesday, the film amassed 46.7 million views in its first three days, making it not just best opening ever for an Adam Sandler Netflix film but also the biggest U.S. opening weekend for a Netflix film period. The original 1996 film also came in at No. 3 on this week's chart with 11.4 million views.


	In addition, Sandler's Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation was No. 7 in the most recent weekly rankings, while both his Grown Ups move have also recently seen time on the streamer's viewership charts.

	The Happy Gilmore sequel, which bowed on the streamer Friday, also made an impact on the social media front, trending all weekend on X with engagement propelled by celebrity support that included Sandler, Travis Kelce, golf stars Rory Mcllroy and Scottie Scheffler, Post Malone and Guy Fieri. It also benefited from the rare social media support of Taylor Swift, who gave a shout-out to the film (which features her boyfriend Kelce) on Instagram Stories.


	The social strength comes as no surprise after Netflix noted earlier this year the largest social engagement for the film's trailer when it bowed online.


	Since signing an exclusive deal with the streamer in 2014, Sandler's films have always been big hits for Netflix. Even so, Happy Gilmore 2 marked the first time he has turned one of his legacy characters into a sequel for the company. The results suggest it worked out.


	Sandler has a busy fall ahead of him starting with his comedy tour Adam Sandler: You're My Best Friend Tour, which will begin in September and hit 37 arenas. He also has Netflix's Jay Kelly, which also stars George Clooney and reunites Sandler with his The Meyerowitz Stories director Noah Baumbach. The upcoming dramedy is getting early awards buzz for both the movie and for Sandler.

Back in Action had bigger opening just this year with 46.8M views.

The movie had a promise. But after the first 30-40 minutes it sank like Titanic.

Once again a true masterpiece like K-pop demon hunters got cancelled for success because of their offended aunties because they rather be teenagers again rather be with their families. Shame on Netflix for crowning this awful movie champ instead of the true champ k pop demon hunters. No one wanted to watch this but their aunties.

I know Netflix generally doesn't care about theatrical releases. But this is one of their movies where I really would have been curious to see what type of numbers it could have done at the box office.

It is hilarious

Pete Davidson is detailing his experience on indie film sets…and he's not totally a fan. The “SNL” alum said during “Hot Ones” in the below video that “there's not anything glamorous” about starring in independent films. 

He recently appeared in TIFF 2024 indie crime comedy “Riff Raff” alongside Jennifer Coolidge, Ed Harris, Gabrielle Union, Lewis Pullman, Michael Angelo Corvino, and Davidson's own personal icon, Bill Murray. Davidson and Murray played two gangsters who are hunting down an ex-criminal family over the holidays. Yet despite the star-studded cast, “Riff Raff” wasn't a “comfortable” experience. 

 










“The movie we did — it's a tough one because it's an indie, so there's no budget and there's not anything glamorous about it,” Davidson said. “No one makes money, no one's comfortable, it's strictly like for the art.”

Adding of working with Murray, Davidson said, “But yeah, he was like kind of captain and kind of calming me down…He's also my dad's favorite actor so that was a cool thing. My dad's favorite movie was ‘Stripes,' so I got to tell him that and that was really cool for me. […] He's a total pro, man.”

 










“The Home” star further reflected on being alongside some of his favorite fellow comedians: Jim Carrey hosted the “Saturday Night Live” episode where Davidson's “first real sketch” aired. “I was so excited because he's Jim Carrey, one of the legends…The sketch bombed to high heavens… and it's online if you want to watch a 20-year-old crumble with his idol,” Davidson quipped. 

And a run-in with Dave Chappelle led to one of Davidson's many now-removed tattoos. “I've never admitted this because it's so humiliating, but when I was like 20, at a comedy club — it might have been the Knitting Factory when Hannibal Buress used to run it — and I did a set, I was like 19 or 20, and Chappelle was in the corner,” he said. “This was before he was back, so seeing him was like crazy, going ‘What the fuck?' And I got off stage and he was like, ‘I watched your whole set — it was really good,' and I was like, ‘Oh, thanks.' I was like, ‘You know, how do you keep coming up with new stuff? I'm working on new stuff and it's like difficult,' and he goes, ‘Jokes come and go, but swag is forever.' … And guess who got that tattooed on his chest? I covered it with ‘Jaws' because I needed something huge to black it out. I just put a giant shark over it. That's pretty bad, dude – but he was like my idol. He still is, but that's so dumb. I could've just told people he said that to me.”

 










Davidson recently starred alongside yet another legendary comedic actor, Eddie Murphy, in Amazon heist comedy “The Pickup.” Davidson told Extra that the film came at the ideal time. “I felt like my dad was looking out for me,” Davidson said about his late father who died in the 9/11 attacks. “I was in a rough patch and I was like, ‘Alright. Here we go. It's not over.' It was a godsend. I was thrilled.”
