In a new post on her site, Snyder explains how she looked at 1,000 AI-related job posts in the Bay Area, Seattle, NYC, and Austin, Texas, analyzing roles for six classes of language. According to Snyder, “No one spikes higher on hype and speed than San Francisco. And in every dimension, Austin is like San Francisco's little sister.” For its part, Seattle came out ahead on ethical language, Snyder wrote, with phrases like “values,” “honesty,” and “integrity” showing up more in Seattle than anywhere else. “But the phrases that work best depend where you live. “Tech may ostensibly share an industry and a language, but culture is still deeply local.” Read more at Snyder's Nerd Processor website, and on LinkedIn where Snyder also shared her findings and has sparked a discussion about it all.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The pixelated LEDs (also found on devices like the ROG Phone 9), flowing in a rhythm from a back strip like a scar streaked dashingly across a warrior's eye, let you know what you're in for before you even crack open the lid. The Strix Scar 18 is a fine gaming laptop with plenty of enticing qualities and one major flaw. But what makes it so appealing isn't the dancing lights that are only attractive to moths or gamers; it's what's underneath the chassis that makes this 18-inch laptop so damn accessible. The $3,400 laptop model Asus sent me for review included the top-end Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 laptop GPU. With 32GB of DDR5 5600 RAM, I didn't encounter an application this desktop replacement-sized mobile PC couldn't handle at the max resolution of 2,560 x 1,600. At its suggested retail price, it's a little more expensive than the HP Omen Max 16 I recently reviewed, which has the same screen resolution in its slightly smaller frame. The refreshed Strix Scar 18 is also more expensive than the last-gen model, a change that likely came after Trump slapped his tariffs on imported goods earlier this year. I saw the refreshed ROG Strix Scar 18 when Asus showed it off at CES earlier this year. More than that, I've felt it with the ROG Strix 17 laptop with an Nvidia RTX 3070 that I use at home. The chiclet keyboard doesn't have the feel anywhere close to a mechanical typing machine, but there's enough travel to make each press substantial. What's most impressive about the laptop is its ability to stay cool under pressure. The Strix Scar 18 makes use of three fans and an end-to-end vapor chamber. The keyboard remained at a perfectly reasonable temperature even when running multiple games for hours on end. Under load, the Strix Scar 18 will sound like a box fan running on high speed next to your ear. The device comes with just enough I/O to save you from immediately jumping for a port dock. There are three USB-A 3.2, a LAN port, and two Thunderbolt 5 ports that support DisplayPort to accompany the single HDMI 2.1. Most gaming laptops of this size demand to be plugged in constantly, and the Strix Scar 18 is no exception. Even while on silent mode doing casual work, I only got a little less than four hours before the laptop was begging me for more juice. Off power, running the machine on performance mode for the sake of gaming, you'd be lucky to get two hours of battery life, or closer to one hour for games that demand higher power draw. The 90Wh battery proved it wasn't enough for a beast of this size, and you'll need to lug around the 380W power brick if you plan to take the device from room to room. Asus spent most of its engineering time developing the Strix Scar 18 refresh, focusing on what was happening underneath the big keyboard. The motherboard and other components are still concealed with a plastic frame that is held on by screws. My model had an easily accessible second slot that would only require me to plug in another solid-state drive to potentially double my storage. I've had to open up previous ROG Strix laptops after I encountered a fault that wouldn't boot the laptop, and that proved an hour-long chore just to unseat and reattach the battery. The quick-release switch will make it easier to clean out dust and keep your device running better for longer. Sure, it's not as customizable as a Framework laptop that lets you replace the entire motherboard if you so choose. But compared to most other gaming laptops, this design is so enticing; I wish all other laptops would go this route. That won't necessarily mean you'll be able to replace other CPU components sometime in the future, but with the specs on my review unit, I wouldn't imagine needing any kind of CPU or GPU upgrade for a long while. It was worse than the Omen Max 16 when using that laptop in its overclocked mode, but the Strix Scar 18 will grant you more than playable frame rates in demanding games from Cyberpunk 2077 to Alan Wake II with a bevy of ray tracing options enabled. The mini-LED display is plenty bright and colorful. Even with Dolby Vision for HDR support, for the amount you're paying, I still miss the inky depths of an OLED display. The display can support up to a 240Hz refresh rate, which means that your games playing at up to 240 fps will look their best, though it lacks variable refresh rate, or VRR, to ensure there won't be screen tearing issues or other visual glitches in games running far below that. I'll admit, the ROG Strix Scar 18's overt lighting and huge, empty keyboard didn't leave the best first impression. It's got the screen, sound quality, and feel you need to contain your gaming all-in-one. More than that, it shows Asus is pushing repairability a little further through small innovations to the rear panel. Let's keep pushing in that direction, and maybe we'll come to a point where we can buy a single laptop and not have to spend another $3,400 a few years down the line.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.K. government is reportedly backing down from its earlier demand that Apple builds a secret backdoor allowing its authorities access to customer data worldwide, following a harsh rebuke from the U.S. government. But one U.S. senator wants to know if other tech giants, like Google, have also received secret backdoor demands from the U.K. government. Critics called the secret order against Apple “draconian,” saying it would have global ramifications for users' privacy. In a new letter sent to top U.S. intelligence official Tulsi Gabbard on Tuesday, Sen. Ron Wyden, who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that while tech companies cannot say whether they have received a U.K. order, at least one technology giant has confirmed that it hasn't received one. Meta, which uses end-to-end encryption to protect user messages sent between WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, told Wyden's office on March 17 that the company has “not received an order to backdoor our encrypted services, like that reported about Apple.” Google, for its part, would not tell Wyden's office if it had received a U.K. government order for accessing encrypted data, such as Android backups, “only stating that if it had received a technical capabilities notice, it would be prohibited from disclosing that fact,” said Wyden. When explicitly asked by TechCrunch, Ryan said: “We haven't received a technical capabilities notice,” referring to any U.K. surveillance order. This story was updated with additional comment from Google, shared in response to a TechCrunch inquiry.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The school year starts soon for many students, and ChatGPT has announced a new “study mode” that aims to prevent—or at least, encourage against—students taking homework shortcuts. The problem is, no matter how engaging ChatGPT's study mode becomes as OpenAI iterates on this feature, it exists just a toggle click away from ChatGPT, with direct answers (and potential fabrications) about whatever class you're working on. That could be quite hard to resist for younger users still developing their frontal lobe. Still, the immediacy and personalized nature of chatbots feels like an escalation. Multiple AI-focused smartphone apps that can solve homework problems with just a snapshot, like ByteDance's Gauth, rocket in popularity whenever the school year gets back into session. Many educators have recently raised concerns about the continued, and often secretive, use of AI by students. ChatGPT's study mode is an attempt to foster more thorough engagement on a topic with users by throwing questions back at them and asking for more context about their learning goals. '” says Abhi Muchha, who works on the product team at OpenAI. While the launch of OpenAI's study mode is more focused on universities, with college students giving their best beta tester testimonials during the press briefing, the company has its attention on an even broader swath of learners—which includes younger students. OpenAI is currently partnering with learning experts from Stanford “to study and share how AI tools, including study mode, influence learning outcomes in areas like K-12 education,” reads the company's announcement blog. This release comes not too long after the Trump administration's executive order focused on getting more AI usage into classrooms in the United States. Even if the initial research that OpenAI participates in about education and AI supports the company's claims that students learn better with a bot by their side, when it's used as a tutor rather than an answer generator, I'm still concerned. What are the long-term impacts of turning to an AI tool for guidance with increasing regularity? It's still unclear if young people, who may grow up constantly asking ChatGPT for help, develop an over-reliance on the software that impedes critical thinking. So, while ChatGPT's study mode is designed to guide students through learning material at their level of understanding, the onus remains on users to engage with the software in a specific way, ensuring that they truly understand the material.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Last week, the Trump administration announced a set of sweeping AI policy recommendations to “usher in a new golden age of human flourishing.” Among the suggested environmental rollbacks laid out in both an executive order and a corresponding AI Action Plan is a set of specific recommendations to essentially loosen Clean Water Act permitting processes for data centers. They mirror suggestions made to regulators earlier this year by both a major data center lobbying group and Meta. In March, the Data Center Coalition (DCC), a lobbying group for the industry whose members include tech giants like Google and Amazon Web Services, wrote a public comment to the Office of Science and Technology Policy in response to its request for information to develop the AI Action Plan. A similar ask around this section of the law was also made by DCC member Meta in its own separate response. The part of the Clean Water Act specifically named in these comments and in the recommendations from the White House deals with how projects like data centers could impact federally protected waters during construction or use, and what materials are discharged into those waters or dredged from them. It's this type of nationwide permit that the new Trump AI agenda seeks to gain for data centers. The AI Action Plan also recommends exempting data centers from what's known as pre-construction notification, an additional form that helps regulators understand the impacts of a project before it begins—another proposal that was in the DCC public comment. Environmental lawyers who spoke with WIRED stressed that direct impacts from data centers depend entirely on the specifics of each individual project. Many data centers have relatively low environmental profiles for the buildings themselves. Buildings like stores, restaurants, hospitals, and schools currently have their own nationwide permit, which some data centers fall under. However, the permit requires a more in-depth, individual analysis if the project impacts more than half an acre of protected water. The DCC in its March comment recommended the creation of a nationwide permit with “robust notification and coverage thresholds” and argued that “lengthy timelines for the approvals are not consistent with other national permits that have higher or no limits or have a threshold where a PCN is not needed, which allows immediate action.” Meta, which has announced its intent to build massive data centers across multiple states and is currently developing a 2,250-acre data center in Louisiana, also asked for a nationwide permit in its comment and suggested that the federal government further “streamline” the 404 permitting process. Meta's chief global affairs officer Joel Kaplan posted on X last week that the AI Action Plan “is a bold step to create the right regulatory environment for companies like ours to invest in America,” and that Meta is “investing hundreds of billions of dollars in job-creating infrastructure across the US, including state-of-the-art data centers.” Meta declined to comment further for this article through a spokesperson. Environmental lawyers aren't so sure that a nationwide permit for data centers, regardless of their size, would follow the intent of the Clean Water Act. While one data center may impact just a “fraction of an acre,” he says, by rebuilding a stream crossing or filling in a wetland, other data centers in different areas of the country may have much larger impacts to local waterways during their construction. Hannah Connor, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, agrees. “What we're seeing here is an attempt to expand the 404 nationwide permitting program so that it goes through this much reduced regulatory review outside of the intention of why [the permitting] program was created,” she says. There are some data center projects in development today that have run into significant issues with federally protected waters. In Indiana, Amazon is currently galvanizing local opposition as it attempts to fill in nearly 10 acres of wetland and more than 5,000 streams to build a massive data center. In Alabama, environmentalists caution that the water footprint from a proposed data center could have serious impacts on local waterways and cause the possible extinction of a species of fish. In a response to a request to comment from WIRED, Amazon spokesperson Heather Layman sent several details via email on the company's global water replenishment projects and its efforts to conserve water at its Indiana data centers. “To maintain global leadership in AI, the US must prioritize the deployment of energy generation and infrastructure to support data center growth,” she wrote. “We are also constantly working to optimize our water consumption across Amazon's operations.” This ruling, Connor suspects, is partly why we may be seeing so many companies choosing to build data centers in dry states like Arizona. Meanwhile, 404 permits for gas pipelines like the Mountain Valley Pipeline have been locked in years of litigation. The executive order signed Wednesday calls for a review of 404 permits not just for data centers, but for a host of other “covered components” that are used to build data centers, ranging from transmission lines to gas pipelines to coal and nuclear power equipment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When YouTube identifies a user as a teen, it introduces new protections and experiences, which include disabling personalized advertising, safeguards that limit repetitive viewing of certain types of content, and enabling digital well-being tools such as screen time and bedtime reminders, among others. These protections already exist on YouTube, but have only been applied to those who verified themselves as teens, not those who may have withheld their real age. The company has also been developing digital well-being tools since 2018. Only users who have been directly verified through this method or whose age has been inferred to be over 18 will be able to view the age-restricted content on the platform. The plans to introduce age inference technology were announced in February as part of YouTube's 2025 roadmap. The features also arrive as social media more broadly is coming under increased government scrutiny in the United States, where platform makers, including Apple and Google, have pitted their lobbyists against those from big tech companies like Meta over who's responsible for age verification and children's safety. In the meantime, a handful of U.S. states have taken matters into their own hands, as over a dozen states have passed or proposed laws to regulate minors' use of social media. Many of these require age verification or parental consent, including those in Louisiana, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Utah, Texas, Maryland, Tennessee, and Connecticut, among others. The new system will apply only to signed-in users, as signed-out users already cannot access age-restricted content, and will be available across platforms, including web, mobile, and connected TV.

Orange, a French telecommunications giant and one of the largest phone providers in the world, announced on Monday that it was the victim of an unspecified cyberattack.

In the announcement, the company said that it detected a cyberattack “on one of its information systems” on July 25, and that it proceeded to “isolate potentially affected services and minimize any impact.”

The move to isolate affected systems, Orange added, caused disruptions to some of the company's platforms, as well as business customers and some public sector services mostly in France, according to a translation of the statement. The announcement said that the solutions the company is implementing will gradually restore services by Wednesday, and that “there is no evidence to suggest that any internal or customer data has been exfiltrated.”

Orange did not respond to TechCrunch's request for comment, which included questions about the nature of the cyberattack, and whether the company has the technical means to detect any data exfiltration. 

The company said in the announcement that it is engaging and informing affected customers, and filed a complaint with “relevant authorities,” without providing specifics. Companies in Europe that are subject to GDPR, the bloc's data protection rules, are required to notify their local data protection authorities within three days of a suspected data breach.

Orange serves 291 million customers worldwide, across 26 different countries, and has 127,000 employees, according to the company.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Boring Company, Elon Musk's tunnel-digging company, and Tennessee Governor Bill Lee have announced a plan to build a 10-mile “loop” that will connect Nashville's downtown and its convention center to the area's airport. The Boring Company and local officials will now begin a “public process to evaluate potential routes, engage community stakeholders, and finalize plans for the project's initial 10-mile phase.” The original video detailing Musk's idea — now set to private on YouTube — showed vehicles getting removed from surface street gridlock by an elevator-meets-sled system and lowered into a three-dimensional underground network of tunnels. Musk also claimed during the first Trump administration that The Boring Company had received “verbal govt approval” to dig tunnels from New York City to Washington, D.C. that, leveraging hyperloop technology, could make the trip in just 29 minutes. The idea of the hyperloop, which Musk admitted to biographer Ashlee Vance came from his hatred of California's high-speed rail system, was also cast aside. Instead, The Boring Company now more closely resembles a glorified convention center people-mover, although there are some potential benefits to its approach versus the typical monorail setup. Construction should be less disruptive to Nashville's daily traffic. And, in its current form at least, it's not costing taxpayers money. Last year, Fortune's Jessica Mathews reported that a Boring Company employee told his then-safety manager: “I have watched my friends get injured due to the fast pace we've been running… I refuse to be the first fatality in this company's history. That same safety manager even spoke to Fortune on the record, saying: “The conditions they were told to work in were honestly almost unbearable … I couldn't fix any of the things that were wrong.” Amplify your reach, spark real connections, and lead the innovation charge.

To catch up with the U.S. and China, the bloc is launching a $30 billion initiative to build a network of high-capacity data centers that can host millions of AI GPUs, reports CNBC. If successful, the EU will have gigawatt-class datacenters with performance akin to that owned by leading U.S. companies. So far, the project has attracted 76 expressions of interest from 16 member states, covering a total of 60 potential locations, according to CNBC. Initial launches are underway, with the first AI factory expected to go live in the coming weeks and a large-scale project in Munich planned for early September. Each gigawatt datacenter is expected to require €3 to €5 billion and deliver a level of computational power far greater than existing AI data centers, potentially supporting over 100,000 advanced AI GPUs per site, according to estimates by UBS cited by CNBC. xAI's Colossus cuper cluster consumes about 150 MW of power when equipped with 100,000 H100 GPUs, so a gigawatt facility will probably be able to host many more GPUs. The EU's effort, if realized, is probably one of the world's largest publicly funded initiatives in artificial intelligence, probably well below what Chinese authorities (both federal and local) have invested in AI data centers, but well ahead of what other big economies invest in their AI efforts. Henna Virkkunen, European Commission executive vice president for technology policy, told CNBC that while Europe has a strong talent base — reportedly 30% more AI researchers per capita than the U.S. — their limited access to computing has held back development. While the EU has access to Nvidia GPUs and other advanced AI accelerators developed in America through a trade agreement with the U.S., Martens pointed out that acquiring hardware is only the beginning. Also, running these data centers profitably and using them to create world-class AI products requires business model development, thorough planning, and interest from private companies, Martens noted. As a result, the AI buildout in Europe may be very gradual to avoid mistakes made by Chinese authorities. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. But perhaps power supply is the biggest concern. A single gigawatt-class data center requires an enormous amount of power, but building such generation capacity takes years. Martens cautioned that Europe's current grid infrastructure might not be ready to support such high loads, and massive upgrades will likely be needed, which will stretch schedules of the project.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The launch of the vehicle, on a Falcon 9 rocket, is scheduled to occur no earlier than August 21 from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. There are two active X-37Bs in the Space Force fleet, both built by Boeing. Since then, the two uncrewed spacecraft have made a succession of longer flights. The first made its longest and latest flight from 2020 to 2022 over a span of 908 days. The second flew more recently, landing at Vandenberg Space Force Base on March 7 after 434 days in orbit. However, for this flight, OTV-8, the military has provided a bit more detail about its intentions. The mission's goals include tests of “high-bandwidth inter-satellite laser communications technologies.” “In so doing, it will strengthen the resilience, reliability, adaptability, and data transport speeds of our satellite communications architectures.” Boeing has previously tested a quantum inertial measurement unit, which detects rotation and acceleration using atom interferometry, on conventional aircraft. The goal of the in-space test is to demonstrate precise positioning, navigation, and timing in an environment where GPS services are not available. “Bottom line: Testing this tech will be helpful for navigation in contested environments where GPS may be degraded or denied,” Saltzman said in a social media post Monday, describing the flight. Quantum inertial sensors could also be used near the moon, where there is no comparable GPS capability, or for exploration further into the solar system. Notably, the small X-37B is back to launching on a medium-lift rocket with this new mission. During its most recent flight that ended in March, the space plane launched on a Falcon Heavy rocket for the first time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The fellowship recognizes Li's innovative work on chip-scale LIDAR systems that replace mechanical parts with acousto-optic beam steering — promising smaller, cheaper, and more scalable optical sensing. Instead of using traditional rotating mirrors or bulky mechanics as traditional LIDAR systems do, this approach uses surface opto-acoustic waves to redirect laser beams in real time. This enables a solid-state LIDAR system that's about 1,000 times smaller than conventional methods, eliminating moving parts, reducing cost, and offering significant advantages in durability and integration. This could be used in many kinds of applications, including autonomous vehicles, drones, traffic control systems, robotic systems, warehouse automation, and medical imaging. While Professor Li was reviewing old research papers, he came across one from the 1970s that used a laser to image an acoustic wave. This gave him an idea: if light could interfere with sound waves at that scale, then sound could be able to interact with coherent light. “By commercializing this technology, we can envision LIDAR where it was never viable before,” Bingzhao Li said. “The Activate Fellowship supports this by promoting entrepreneurship with a mentorship system and potential partnerships found throughout their network.” The company name is an acronym for Laser-Enhanced Automation Perception. It reflects the hybrid approach of using both light and sound to manipulate data and perception at the nanoscale, all enabled by artificial intelligence. The work builds on years of research conducted in Mo Li's lab at UW, which has pioneered optomechanical systems that couple light and sound on a chip. In a related 2023 breakthrough, Li and his colleagues demonstrated a method of detecting “atomic breathing”— quantum-level oscillations — through interactions between light and phonons. This “acousto-optic beam steering” is generated on-chip using high-frequency sound pulses in the gigahertz range. The process results in phonons, an emergent phenomenon, also referred to as quantum quasi-particles. “Bingzhao's success is a strong validation that we're getting closer.” In addition to the Activate award, Li's research has received backing from agencies like DARPA, the National Science Foundation, and UW's CoMotion innovation hub, which supported patent filings and licensing efforts. During the two years covered by the Activate Fellowship, LEAP Photonics plans to take its technology from a minimal viable product to fully-featured prototype. By then, it expects to have a product ready for the marketplace. Still, challenges remain before the technology can be widely deployed. The prototype, while highly compact, will need improvements in range and environmental stability to match today's industrial LIDAR systems. But those who've followed Bingzhao Li's trajectory say he's well-positioned to bridge that gap. “I think taking this entrepreneurship path is a very brave move and he choose this path for two reasons,” Mo Li observed. The chip-scale LIDAR system is not just a more efficient sensor. Activate Global was founded in 2015, a nonprofit organization that came out of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The fellowship program provides a two-year salary, allowing scientists a chance to take their technologies from the research stage to commercially viable product. The Fellowship is supported by a broad range of government agencies, philanthropies, investors, and corporations. Since its inception, Activate has supported 249 fellows, resulting in 236 startups, and generating more than $4 billion in additional public and private support for fellows' work. The organization does not take any financial stake in fellows' companies, technologies, or IP.

A Redditor has demonstrated the ability of the recently launched ChatGPT agent to casually swat away a CAPTCHA, so that it can complete its assigned task(s). A couple of illustrative screenshots show the ChatGPT Agent handle, and commentate upon, dismissing Cloudflare's ‘I am not a robot' button (h/t Germany's WinFuture). Logkn's Reddit post doesn't provide any background details about the agent's task at hand. However, we can see it was filling out some kind of web-based form, where it had to choose a translation target language. “This step is necessary to prove I'm not a bot and proceed with the action,” it added without a hint of irony. After sidestepping Cloudflare's digital bouncer, the agent continued to dryly recount its progress. However, its minimal nature and lightweight bot filtering stance are definitely not bulletproof as far as the new ChatGPT agent is concerned. WinFuture notes that Cloudflare's system “checks user behavior such as mouse movements, click times, and browser fingerprints to distinguish between humans and machines” (machine translation). The primary attraction of this agent is that, within the confines of “its own virtual computer,” the agent can be set and complete complex tasks from start to finish, says OpenAI. The pioneering AI firm insists that the ChatGPT agent will always leave its user in control, asking permission “before taking actions of consequence,” and being easy to interrupt or stop in its tracks.

Hacking groups are continuing to launch cyberattacks on Russia as a show of solidarity with Ukraine—whose military intelligence agency reportedly conducted an operation of its own against Russia-occupied Crimea—as the conflict between the countries continues. RBC-Ukraine reported that Ukraine "carried out a large-scale special operation targeting the occupation authorities in Crimea" that culminated in "a powerful DDoS attack [that] effectively paralyzed the information systems and network infrastructure in Crimea." Although there are exceptions, like when someone finds a way to send dozens of terabytes of traffic per second to a single target, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks usually aren't very sophisticated. They simply bombard their target with too much traffic for it to handle. But sophistication is not a prerequisite for effectiveness—especially when a DDoS attack causes enough of a distraction for Ukraine to steal a reported 100TB of data from other targets before "[wiping] all data stored on the servers of regional and district government bodies, ministries, and agencies of the occupation administration in Crimea," per RBC-Ukraine. This combination of a DDoS attack and another operation is so common that it can make responding to a DDoS attack more complex than simply mitigating the immediate service disruptions. Organizations also have to determine if the DDoS attack is merely a distraction, like it was here, and if so, what exactly it was supposed to be distracting them from. Ukraine's military intelligence agency wasn't alone in carrying out destructive cyberattacks against Russia. The Kyiv Independent reported that the Silent Crow and Belarusian Cyber Partisans hacking groups conducted a similar operation against a Russian airline called Aeroflot.

According to Reuters, the company has placed a fresh order for 300,000 H20 AI GPUs with TSMC, spurred by unexpectedly strong demand from Chinese tech giants. This move comes just weeks after the Trump administration reversed an April ban on the H20, a China-specific chip designed to comply with U.S. export controls but still powerful enough to dominate AI inference workloads. The decision marks a reversal of Nvidia's earlier stance. CEO Jensen Huang, during a recent visit to Beijing, had hinted that H20 production would remain paused unless customer demand justified a restart—something that would take nine months to spin up. But with existing stockpiles of 600,000–700,000 H20 units quickly dwindling, and reports of smuggling and a booming repair market for banned GPUs, Nvidia is clearly seeing enough momentum to justify new orders. While it lacks the raw power of Nvidia's actual flagship H100 or the newer Blackwell series, industry insiders say it's finely tuned for AI inference tasks, with some experts noting that it can even outperform the H100 in certain workloads. Chinese tech heavyweights like Tencent, ByteDance, and Alibaba had already stockpiled these chips ahead of the April ban, often pairing them with DeepSeek's cost-optimized AI models. Nvidia still requires export licenses for these shipments, and sources told Reuters that the Commerce Department has yet to approve them. In the meantime, Nvidia is asking Chinese customers to submit detailed order forecasts and documentation, signaling a more tightly controlled distribution pipeline. After the April ban, Nvidia warned of a potential $5.5 billion inventory write-off and an additional $15 billion in lost sales — a hit that would have dented its lead in the AI hardware race. For context, Nvidia sold roughly 1 million H20 chips in 2024, meaning this latest TSMC order represents nearly a third of last year's total volume. If Chinese developers migrate fully to Huawei's competing solutions, the long-term loss could be far greater than any short-term political fallout. The H20 may not be Nvidia's flagship, but in the high-stakes U.S.-China tech rivalry, it's becoming a chip that symbolizes far more than just performance.

These wireless earbuds come packed with smart AI features and noise cancellation that actually works – no empty promises here. They even scored Gizmodo's Editors' Choice, which says a lot. If you've got a Samsung phone, these buds are like a dream come true and they leave the AirPods Pro trailing behind. The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro come with a package of technology that should improve your listening experience in smarter ways: To begin with, the active noise cancellation (ANC) is excellent. It not only minimizes ambient noise but it also adapts to your environment and activities so your favorite music or calls sound richer. The sound itself is also balanced with deep bass, sharp highs and clear mids. Samsung redesigned the earbuds for a fit that is comfortable but not intrusive: You can wear them for long hours without discomfort which is crucial when you're using them through the day for calls. And with their lightweight build, carrying these earbuds around in your pocket or bag is effortless. They also have smart features that are convenient to use on a daily basis: You can easily control with touch controls by pausing, playing, skipping tracks and turning on your voice assistant with just a touch. Samsung's AI interpreter can even translate real-time which is a welcome feature for the traveler or friends who speak in foreign languages. Battery life is good too, with many hours of playtime from one charge, along with extra juice when you charge through the case, so you can stay plugged in a lot longer than regular earbuds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After the United Kingdom's Online Safety Act went into effect on Friday, requiring porn platforms and other adult content sites to implement user age verification mechanisms, use of virtual private networks (VPNs) and other circumvention tools spiked in the UK over the weekend. But as a new wave of age check regulations debuts, open internet advocates warn that the uptick in use of circumvention tools in the UK is the latest example of how an escalating cat-and-mouse game can develop between people looking to anonymously access services online and governments seeking to enforce content restrictions. The Online Safety Act requires that websites hosting porn, self-harm, suicide, and eating disorder content implement “highly effective” age checks for visitors from the UK. And along with increased demand for services like VPNs—which allow users to mask basic indicators of their physical location online—people have also been playing around with other creative workarounds. In some cases, reportedly, you can even use the video game Death Stranding's photo mode to take a selfie of character Sam Porter Bridges and submit it to access age-gated forum content. The UK's communications regulator Ofcom says that more than 6,600 porn websites have introduced age checks so far. And major social platforms like Reddit, X, and Bluesky have also added age verification for content that is now restricted in the UK or are in the process of doing so. Microsoft has even started rolling out voluntary age checks for Xbox users in the UK. But even if this movement is satisfactory for now, digital rights advocates point out that normalizing such mechanisms creates the possibility that they will be enforced more aggressively in the future. “I think people just want to show that we can make some progress on this without thinking about what the consequences of the progress will be,” says Daniel Kahn Gillmor, a senior staff technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union. And that involves having an adequate social support network; it involves listening when kids run into problems and making sure that they have functioning emotional relationships with adults who can respond to them. Seema Shah, VP of research and insights at the market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, says five VPN apps have experienced particularly “explosive growth” and reached the top 10 free apps on Apple's UK App Store by Monday. “According to Sensor Tower estimates, iOS devices have seen a greater spike in VPN downloads in the UK, as downloads across the selected VPN apps are up an average of 100 percent day-over-day over the past four days on iOS versus a 5 percent day-over-day increase for Android devices,” Shah says. In a post on X on Friday, Proton VPN claimed that “just a few minutes after the Online Safety Act went into effect last night, Proton VPN sign-ups originating in the UK surged by more than 1,400%.” David Peterson, general manager of Proton VPN, told WIRED that since then there has been a sustained 1,800 percent increase in daily sign-ups. “Such spikes in demand for VPNs are not unusual,” Laura Tyrylyte, Nord Security's head of public relations, tells WIRED. She adds in a statement that “whenever a government announces an increase in surveillance, internet restrictions, or other types of constraints, people turn to privacy tools.” But as countries that have long claimed to champion the open internet and access to information, like the United States, begin considering or adopting age verification laws meant to protect children, the boundaries for protecting digital rights online quickly become extremely murky. “There will be a large number of people who are using circumvention tech for a range of reasons” to get around age verification laws, the ACLU's Kahn Gillmor says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite how Ross' paleontology career is treated by his companions in Friends, there's something special about finding the remains of creatures that lived millions if not billions of years before us. Ancient Romans were just as fascinated by fossils. According to the ancient Roman historian Suetonius, Emperor Augustus established the first known paleontological museum at his villa on the island of Capri, where he showcased the bones of ancient “giants” and “monsters.” While paleontologists have yet to uncover such fantastical remains, a study published Thursday in the journal Science describes something that, in my opinion, is even more special—an ancient Roman amulet crafted from the fossil of a critter that lived between 453 and 460 million years ago. Trilobites are a group of marine arthropods that existed between 521 and 251 million years ago. It's also the “third trilobite in the global archaeological record to have been collected and used by people over a thousand years ago,” they added. The rare artifact came to light in a Roman settlement in northwestern Spain called A Cibdá of Armea that existed from the first to the third century CE. Either way, someone clearly altered the fossil. “These marks do not affect the upper surface, which displays the characteristic articulated segments of a trilobite's dorsal exoskeleton. Regardless of how the trilobite was fashioned, it was likely kept for supernatural, propitiatory, or medicinal purposes and abandoned between the first and third centuries CE. “It is plausible to consider that the Armea trilobite may have been perceived to hold magical and protective powers for its wearer, as is the case with fossils or even trilobites in other well-known archaeological contexts,” the researchers wrote. Coincidentally, archaeologists found the trilobite next to a bronze coin of Augustus. The discovery is a testament to the fact that humanity's curiosity for that which came before us is a universal trait that transcends cultures, borders, and even time itself. It stands as a reassuring reminder, especially in times like these—when the only thing everyone seems to agree on is our many differences.
