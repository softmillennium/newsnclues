                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On a recent episode of Supernatural Confrontations with L.A. Marzulli, two courageous women recounted their remarkable experiences with the supernatural realm. Heidi, a born-again Christian and mother of two, described a surreal early-morning encounter in 2018 while living in Bradenton, Florida. She awoke to a strange cold sensation and, peering down the hallway toward her children's bedroom, witnessed what she described as a towering “tin soldier” standing guard over her son's doorway. “He was literally just in shining silver armor. Initially terrified, Heidi then heard a calm, male voice tell her, “Look again.” When she did, the figure remained motionless. Though the experience lasted only seconds, it was seared into her memory. Her children believed it was their guardian angel—and Marzulli agreed, describing it as a moment of “hyper-dimensionality” where the spiritual realm intersected with the physical. After being warned not to go outside, she disobeyed, only to have her storm door violently slam shut. She looked up and saw “a huge man, very, very, very strong… in armor… and on his shoulder was the head of an eagle.” He told her firmly, “Don't go outside again.” Stay up to date with current issues, Holy Spirit news, Christian teachings, Charisma videos & more! Moments later, the spiritual atmosphere grew darker. Leslie began praying as shadowy demonic figures swarmed outside her home. In desperation, she called out to God. “Lord, come speedily to my aid,” she cried, quoting Psalm 70. Then, in a vision, she saw the night sky open with concentric rings of clouds, “like a telescope,” as angels poured through to engage in heavenly warfare. Though family members remembered the shaking, they had no recollection of the spiritual battle unfolding around them. These testimonies serve as sobering reminders of a hidden war that rages beyond human perception. As Marzulli affirmed, “The supernatural world is extremely real.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Republican lawmakers in nearly 20 states have introduced legislation to prevent weather modification. Some of the laws allude to “chemtrails,” a conspiracy theory that planes aren't leaving “contrails” of condensation in the atmosphere but are spreading chemicals on an unsuspecting public. In July, right-wing concerns about weather modification reached a new fever pitch. Days later, Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene and Tim Burchett introduced the Clear Skies Act, a bill that would levy steep penalties for anyone who “knowingly conducts weather modification,” including geoengineering, cloud seeding, solar radiation modification, and the release of aerosol to “influence temperature, precipitation, or the intensity of sunlight.” In fact, she added to the conspiracy theory with her now-infamous “Jewish space lasers” comment. Greene isn't actually worried about manmade impact on the environment; after all, she's got no problems with fossil fuels. Rather, she's latched onto conspiracy theories about how weather can be controlled by those in power. Meanwhile, Greene said she saw a kind of “funny hypocrisy” from the environmentalists who oppose pollution but not weather manipulation. In interviews, Greene and Burchett said that the impetus for their legislation was concerns of constituents. While weather modification does exist, it can't be weaponized as Greene has implied. Several states have programs for cloud seeding—a decades-old technology that helps to induce rain—including California, Nevada, Idaho, Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, and North Dakota.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cosmic rays may be sufficient to nourish life residing underground on planets and moons within our solar system, according to new research from NYU Abu Dhabi that broadens the search for extraterrestrial life beyond the traditional “Goldilocks Zone.” High-energy ionizing radiation from cosmic rays is typically harmful to life and can cause DNA damage. However, here on Earth, we are shielded from most of these rays by our planet's atmosphere. Challenging the traditional view that sunlight or volcanic heat are necessary for life, Atri's team investigated what might happen when cosmic rays encounter underground liquid water or water ice. Their findings revealed that cosmic rays can break down water molecules, releasing electrons. Even in dark, cold environments completely devoid of sunlight, radiolysis has enabled bacteria to survive beneath Earth's surface—and it may do the same elsewhere in the solar system. The researchers focused on Mars, Saturn's moon Enceladus, and Jupiter's moon Europa—each of which is thought to harbor subsurface water and is considered a potential candidate for extraterrestrial life. “This discovery changes the way we think about where life might exist,” said Atri. “Instead of looking only for warm planets with sunlight, we can now consider places that are cold and dark, as long as they have some water beneath the surface and are exposed to cosmic rays. Life might be able to survive in more places than we ever imagined.” Astrobiologists have long focused on the “Goldilocks Zone,” the region around a star where a planet is neither too hot nor too cold to support liquid water on its surface. This includes areas where cosmic rays could interact with underground water, potentially providing a source of energy for microbial life via radiolysis. Applying the Radiolytic Habitable Zone concept may prompt future space missions to rethink their approach. He can be contacted at ryan@thedebrief.org, and follow him on Twitter @mdntwvlf.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mama June Shannon is in the hospital just shortly after a psychic warned her about future health troubles. On the July 25 episode of Mama June: Family Crisis, the 45-year-old met with a psychic with daughter Jessica Shannon and husband Justin Stroud for Jessica's bachelorette party. During the session, the psychic told June that she's "lost a lot of her health” and is carrying a lot of stress, which isn't good. The psychic added that she "may have a heart attack" because of it. Justin suggests taking June to the hospital but she refuses. “It is way worse than it has ever been,” June said as they got in the car to go to the emergency room. Ovarian cysts are common; the Mayo Clinic states that "many women have ovarian cysts at some time," and most "present little or no discomfort and are harmless." However, large or ruptured cysts "can cause serious symptoms," including severe pelvic pain and bleeding, fullness or heaviness in the abdomen and bloating. In rare cases, a ruptured ovarian cyst may require surgery. Many celebrities have revealed their painful experiences with ovarian cysts, including Hailey Bieber, Marsai Martin, Kate Beckinsale, Hilary Swank, Lena Dunham, Olivia Culpo, Miley Cyrus and more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A five-year study dispels the stereotype of conspiracy theorists as angry loners or keyboard warriors. Rather, social and emotional connections provided by conspiracy theorists are recruiting diverse participants on a growing scale. The researchers, from the University of Bath's School of Management and Trinity College Dublin, followed individuals on the cusp of becoming conspiracy theorists to understand how people become involved in fringe ideas. "We were initially apprehensive about approaching groups often depicted as delusional, dangerous and angry," said Dr. Tim Hill. This social quality of these contexts became key to our findings." The researchers say they hope the study will reshape discussions of how people become involved in conspiracy theories, moving away from ideas that belief in conspiracy theory is motivated by personality or irrational thinking alone. During the first stage of data collection (2017–2018), they were introduced to a community interested in a variety of conspiracy theories. From 32 interviews with 23 participants, they identified three main stages to believing in conspiracy theories. Firstly, an experience that leads people to question trusted sources of knowledge—in many cases this could be feeling let down by public sector services or authority figures, which leads them to feel emotionally connected to conspiracy ideas. Secondly, people make sense of conspiracy theories together, which strengthens shared beliefs. Elle, a 20-year-old massage therapist who came to believe that COVID-19 was coordinated by powerful groups of 'deep state' actors said, "My friends and me, we see the world now through a new set of eyes. Dr. Hill said, "Conspiracy theories provide reassuringly simple answers, but more than just solving problems, they create shared emotions, belonging and community. The campaigner will give their thoughts which are followed by clapping, giving a sense of solidarity and positivity that a clear, definitive answer has been identified." In the final stage, people not only believe in the theories but also take action based on them—to protest as part of a conspiracy movement. Often this follows on from 'doing their own research'—reading official documents and taking on board a wealth of conspiracy-related information, which enables them to produce their own conspiratorial explanations. Co-author Professor Robin Canniford, also from Bath's School of Management, said, "The participatory aspect of conspiracy theories encourages people to become involved. It's a thriving and welcoming social scene where people feel they are better informed about the workings of the world and are ready to take action." However, the social nature of conspiracy theory communities does not mean they are benevolent. One participant had become estranged from his family and received a criminal conviction following his involvement in anti-lockdown protests, demonstrating how conspiracy theories can tear apart families and lives. Co-author Dr. Stephen Murphy, from Trinity Business School, said, "While these groups offer a sense of belonging, it's crucial to recognize that they can equally lead to division and distress in personal relationships outside of conspiracy communities."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a recent interview, writer Ryukishi07—known for his work on seminal horror story Higurashi When They Cry—has described the supernatural and psychological elements of Silent Hill f as being “salad dressing”. At a panel alongside producer Motoi Okamoto and composer and sound designer Akira Yamaoka, Ryukishi07, according to Famitsu (via Automaton), said that players will have trouble in telling the difference between the psychological and supernatural horror motifs of the game. Rather than having several different kinds of themes in the game's story, Ryukishi07 instead focused on a central theme around which the entire story would then be written. Expanding on his “salad dressing” metaphor, he explained that supernatural and psychological elements would act like distinct ingredients of a salad dressing – like oil and vinegar. While he didn't go into too many details about what this might mean, his explanation indicated that players might end up having a hard time distinguishing between the supernatural elements of the game from the various kinds of psychological terror that is likely also lurking behind dark corners. For some context, while many Silent Hill games have featured supernatural elements, like the presence of cults and evil deities in Silent Hill 1 and 3, Silent Hill 2, on the other hand, focused purely on psychological horror. Many of the terrors faced by protagonist James Sutherland in Silent Hill 2 were essentially the town of Silent Hill forcing him to come to terms with his own trauma; even the enemies of the game were designed based on his own psychoses. Ryukishi07's “salad dressing” metaphor might indicate that the game's story will blend both of these styles of horror together to create even more uncertainty within players' minds. At the same event, NeoBards senior producer Albert Lee, along with series producer at Konami, Motoi Okamura, spoke about how there was a lot of time spent in coming up with ideas to bring the game's setting of Showa Era town Ebisugaoka to life. The decision to set the town in 1960s Japan was also part of this back-and-forth, because the studio wanted to present players with an environment that would feel “familiar yet alien”. The opening video, which was captured by those in attendance, showcased protagonist Hinako speaking to a doll. Silent Hill f is coming to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S on September 25.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Demi Moore is one of the biggest stars in Hollywood, especially now after her comeback that led to an Oscar nomination with her outstanding performance in The Substance. But the siren's image was not always so slick. The St Elmo's Fire actress was born with a very different name that did not quite have a ring to it: Demi Gene Guynes. Earlier this year Demi told fans how to say her first name properly: Moore confirmed that she pronounces her name as 'Duh-mee' because it 'works better' with her last name. Demi Moore is one of the biggest stars in Hollywood, especially now after her comeback that led to an Oscar nomination with her turn in The Substance. The Substance actress was born with a very different name that did not quite have a ring to it: Demi Gene Guynes. And the Landman actress grew up in Roswell, New Mexico Her biological father, Air Force airman Charles Foster Harmon Sr., left her mother, who was only 18-years-old at the time, before Demi's birth. When Moore was three months old, her mother married Dan Guynes, a newspaper advertising salesman who often switched up his jobs; as a result, the family moved many times. Moore learned that Guynes was not her real father at age 13, when she discovered a marriage certificate and inquired about the circumstances since she 'saw my parents were married in February 1963. Moore said in 1991, 'My dad is Dan Guynes. There is a man who would be considered my biological father who I don't really have a relationship with.' Demi and her mother shared plenty of drama: they became estranged in 1989, but reconciled shortly before Guynes death in 1998. When Demi was 14 she and her mom moved to West Hollywood, where she started modeling and taking acting classes. That is how she became Demi Moore. Her first blockbuster was Ghost in 1990 with Patrick Swayze and Whoopi Goldberg Her career took off at a young age. Following that came her famous Brat Pack phase. The Hollywood star told People: 'I think the first big moment that kind of gave me a little bit of encouragement of, wow, this could be possible, is when I got 'General Hospital' because it was a real job on a show that was successful for a soap opera. Demi quickly became convinced that she had a long-term future in the entertainment industry. And so it was like a real job where I was going to be paid and have an actual salary. So that was like the first moment to really kick it off.' Her latest hit show is Landman; seen with Jacob Lofland, Ali Larter, Billy Bob Thornton and Andy Garcia from Landman Moore has retained her movie star looks and slim figure Looking at a photo from a publicity shoot for General Hospital, Demi said: 'I got General Hospital a month before my 19th birthday, so I think I'm 19 years old. 'You know, I just was so excited for all of it. The actress has been working in Hollywood for decades, and Demi has now reached a place of 'radical acceptance' in her life.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Recently, upon mentioning to a friend that my upcoming novel had supernatural elements, he quipped: What is it with you and the paranormal? And I like to use these elements in my mystery novels to ratchet up the stakes, because of the element of not knowing. I'm not talking the spectral visions from Disneyland's Haunted House (though that ride was an early influence on me, not gonna lie). But rather the spooky feeling of shivers going up one's back with no apparent cause. The eerie feeling of waking in the middle of the night and wondering whether that unnerving thump was real, or part of a dream. Merriam-Webster defines paranormal as something that stands outside the normal, or that which is not scientifically explainable. The not knowingness of the supernatural can enhance tension and put readers on edge, whether the novel is explicitly paranormal, or employs subtle inferences to something otherworldly, or simply hints at things that are beyond our ken. The following are a few guidelines I use when incorporating the supernatural in my mystery novels, whether the story is cozy or gritty or noir: Rule number one for incorporating supernatural elements in a novel: The fictional world has to make sense. If a character is psychic, can she see and feel all, at any time, or is she bound by the limits of her skills and energies, or by something else? If you're introducing mythical creatures, how much agency do they have to interact with—to threaten or to help—the other characters in the novel? No matter what, begin by grounding your world in the magical. The supernatural is not a coat of paint applied atop the secular and scientific human realm. Steven Spielberg was considered a genius for not showing the dreaded shark in the movie Jaws, and instead allowing the audience's imaginations to run amok with horrifying images. His decision was due more to technical difficulties than an artistic choice, but the point is that the human imagination—informed as it is by personal history and idiosyncratic quirks—tends to create much more vivid (and awful) images than what can be conjured on film. Keeping the reader in suspense, letting them wonder not only “what will happen” but “is it even real?” helps to build tension, support pacing, and enhance the mystery. Recently I reread Stephen King's classic ghost story, The Shining, and was surprised to realize that the actual ghosts appear rarely in the book. King instead creates a mounting sense of dread, based primarily on the horrifying setup of a mother and child snowbound and trapped with an unreliable and potentially violent man. Just as with oversharing a character's backstory early on, refrain from showing too much of the paranormal world on the page too soon. It is a sad reality that much of human history, and everyday human behavior, is disturbing. There is a reason people are so ready to believe that abandoned prisons, asylums for the mentally ill, poor farms, and orphanages might be haunted. How can so much suffering not have had an impact on the physical world such that the negative energy is absorbed by material objects and passed down through the ages? This is key to your storytelling. The supernatural aspects of your story might also reflect troubling current events, the way Jordan Peele uses pervasive racism as a horror element in his film, Get Out. Or how Mary Shelley famously exploited suspicions about early science and technology in her archetypal account of Frankenstein's terrifying monster. Other real-world afflictions such as sleep paralysis, psychosis, memory loss, poisoning, and carbon monoxide overexposure can also lead to everyday people “experiencing” hauntings, vision, or demons. Such examples can be used to keep the reader wondering what is real and what is not. And remember: Scary does not necessarily equal evil. Facing our fears may lead to healing and redemption. The reader is here for it; let your characters be, as well. As any caretaker of small children can attest, we humans are hard-wired to take risks. As we mature, quelled as we are by experience and the limits of the human body, most of us mellow. We just explore it by different means. The mystery world is vast, and we need your support to cover it the way it deserves.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What's the deal with Jeffrey Epstein's client list? And who, exactly, is implicated in the Epstein files? These are the questions that have been the subject of feverish speculation ever since Elon Musk alleged that his erstwhile wingman Donald Trump is “in the Epstein files”. Perhaps Trump's penchant for turning conspiracy theories into political weapons has exploded in his face. But conspiracy theories are about a lot more than their political effectiveness. Epstein's “client list” is a document rumoured to have been maintained by the disgraced financier, which kept track of his network of wealthy and influential acquaintances — as well as, perhaps, his fellow sexual predators. During his 2024 election campaign, Trump indicated that he was willing to declassify “the Epstein files” — which are thought to contain “contacts, communications … flight logs” and, of course, the infamous client list. According to standard doctrine in parts of the right-wing populist MAGAverse, those nefarious elites — especially liberals and Democrats — not only looked down on average Americans, but thought they could get away with all manner of immorality and depravity — up to and including the sexual exploitation of children. It was a role that Donald Trump, with his insatiable need for attention and entertainer's instinct for giving the audience what they want, was more than happy to play. Following Musk's parting shot in June, however, Trump has been doubling down on denials and attacking those people who “want to talk about … the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax”. He's urged his supporters not to “waste Time and Energy” on it — and if these “weaklings” can't find it within themselves to move on, he said “I don't want their support anymore!” But his formerly loyal followers aren't falling into line the way Trump hoped. On top of that, it has been reported in both the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times that Trump appears repeatedly in the files — and that the US President was told as much by Attorney General Pam Bondi in May of this year. This reporting has served to reinforce the previous testimony of women as to the closeness of Epstein and Trump, and one woman accused Trump of groping her during a visit to Trump Towers in Epstein's presence around 1993. It's no wonder so many people are now wondering, what is Trump concealing? Here, however, I want to think through what the Epstein files episode suggests about conspiracy itself. A conspiracy theorist, in turn, is someone who claims to see what's really going on and takes upon themselves the responsibility of alerting the masses. Part of the attraction of conspiratorial narratives is their ability to make sense complex, disturbing phenomena and provide clear-cut answers. believing in conspiracy theories can possibly increase the sense of coherence, to the extent that they help their followers make sense of the complexity of the world by providing them with simple, overarching narratives in which most events can be integrated. Indeed, past research has shown that presenting participants with information ordered in an identifiable pattern increased the feeling of coherence, and thereby feelings of meaning in life. The Epstein affair has all the ingredients of a classic conspiracy: there are the shady millionaires responsible for egregious abuses of power (some of which have been proven, others remain rumours); there are the concealed documents that may contain sordid facts; and there is the mystery surrounding Epstein's own purported suicide in prison. Is Donald Trump implicated in the Epstein files — in which case, he would belong to the shadowy elite who have gotten away with prodigious abuses of power — or is Trump the victim of someone else's plot (say, a Democratic effort to topple his presidency, as Trump likes to claim)? American financier Jeffrey Epstein (left) and real estate developer Donald Trump as they pose together at the Mar-a-Lago estate, Palm Beach, Florida, in 1997. This points to several features of conspiracy theories that reveal a great deal about how they function and why they spread. First, conspiracies almost always contain kernels of truth. In this case, Jeffrey Epstein was accused of horrific crimes and there is significant documentary evidence of his guilt. He has also been photographed and filmed many times in the presence of Donald Trump. And 27 women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct. These are simply the elements that have a basis in reality, which are combined in various ways to produce the particular conspiracy theory. I like to think of them as resembling Gremlins or the eponymous terrors from Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Just when you thought that one conspiracy has been debunked, or at least has faded from view, another emerges in its place to counter the previous one and set the record straight. That's why trying to quash conspiracy theories is like playing a game of whack-a-mole. Third, conspiracy can be a rhetorical tool, used to silence critics by painting them as irrational, ideologically biased and therefore unreliable. Fourth, conspiracies have proliferated on the world wide web. It's also because of what Tommaso Venturini calls “online attention dynamics”: in order for content not to get lost, it needs to be picked up by algorithms, shared and re-shared on social media and, hopefully, “go viral”. At best, these conspiracies — alluring and lurid as they are — contribute to a disorienting cultural condition that is sometimes glossed as “post-truth”. In a post-truth world, “objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief”. In such a world, anything, no matter how outlandish or factually unverified, can potentially be true — which also means that anything can be denied. According to this post-truth logic, there can be an Epstein client list and such a list can be non-existent. One such woman has remarked that the financier's alleged “victims are people with feelings that are trying to live their everyday lives”, and the media attention surrounding the conspiracies “can feel like a real weight falling on us”. Indeed, one thing that Trump and his fellow travellers have managed to do is make this entire sordid affair about him. By focusing attention on Trump either as either a source of truth (he will be the one to release the Epstein files and expose those predatory elites) or an obfuscator of it (for whatever reason). They have directed attention away from issues like misogyny, male sexual entitlement and sexualised abuses of power. They have directed attention away from the sordid networks of influence, intimidation and impunity that enabled Epstein to get away with his crimes for so long — and when he was initially held to account in 2006, to receive a paltry plea deal.
