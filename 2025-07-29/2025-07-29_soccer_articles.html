                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you're looking to get your hands on FIFA World Cup tickets for next year, you're not the only one. “Probably in the hundreds,” Blue said with a laugh in an interview with Offside when asked about how many ticket requests he's gotten for next year's tournament. “It will be growing substantially as the weeks and months go on.” Canada Soccer has an eight per cent allotment of tickets for their home matches, with the choice of how to spread them out up to the federation. Each tier will be given an equal number of tickets for next year's World Cup, though higher tiers, by nature, may have a smaller number of members competing for tickets. Pricing for the tickets has yet to be announced. “We're trying to do our best in the context of the World Cup ticket access issue, to be thoughtful about accommodations for long-standing members of the Canadian soccer community, while also building and enhancing a revenue stream that is going to reinvest proceeds directly back into the sport,” Blue added. Interested fans can sign up via the Canada Soccer website. For those who might sign up for CanadaRED but not end up with World Cup tickets, Blue hopes that people recognize the projects their contributions end up supporting the national team and other soccer programs throughout the country. In conjunction with commercial partners, the Canadian government and the third-party agency Canadian Soccer Business that handles much of the national team's commercial endeavours, including media rights, Blue stressed CanadaRED as a key component of Canada Soccer's revenue generation plan moving forward. Canada currently has five matches set to be played before the FIFA World Cup begins next year, with two of them on home soil. So far, both home matches will be in Montreal, which missed out on a chance to host World Cup games next summer, with Australia announced as one of the two opponents. Canada will also be playing a neutral-site game against Colombia in New Jersey, and road contests against Romania and Wales. Blue highlighted sporting considerations (quality of opponent), appearance fees (to pay to the opponent) and travel considerations (for the players and staff) as to what typically goes into the decision-making when setting up upcoming friendlies. (BC Place will have grass for next year's World Cup.) So we are eager to move teams around, and it is a significant sort of puzzle to put together,” Blue added. Ticket sales have also been an inconsistent challenge for the men's team in recent years, as they have not drawn above 25,000 fans for a match on home soil since March 2022. We're not trying to generate maximum revenue for the sake of making profit,” Blue said. “We want to be able to make revenue and be commercially successful so that we can fund the operation of our national teams and other things that we do at the grassroots level. I think if you look at how our friendly ticket pricing has gone, it's  relatively more affordable compared to other high-profile sporting events.” With less than a year to go until Canada's first match at next year's World Cup, all eyes will be on the squad — and its management team — to see how they handle this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Al Nassr is currently undergoing a full-scale restructuring both on and off the field. Al Nassr is reportedly preparing a lucrative offer that could be hard to turn down for the Spaniard, whose stock has risen significantly under new Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca. Despite Chelsea's deep roster, the left-back position is not particularly crowded, with Cucurella and Ben Chilwell as the only natural options. The club is not just looking to strengthen the team but also to re-energize a fanbase that has grown frustrated with recent poor results — especially as Al Hilal and Al Ittihad continue to pull ahead. Cristiano Ronaldo reportedly played instrumental role in Joao Felix's surprise move to Al Nassr Cucurella played a vital role in Chelsea's recent UEFA Conference League and FIFA Club World Cup victories. Although he currently intends to continue his career in the Premier League, Al Nassr is expected to approach him with a compelling offer aimed at making him a key figure in the Saudi Pro League. The Spanish international has recently bounced back after a rough stretch marked by injuries and criticism, re-establishing himself as an essential piece of Chelsea's defense.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tim Vickery reveals who Fluminense's most important player is ahead of the Club World Cup. Tournaments instantly become history, but they have ramifications. More than two weeks have passed since the final whistle blew at the FIFA Club World Cup, yet its impact is still being felt, not in trophy cabinets, but in transfer negotiations. For some players at South American clubs, this wasn't just another competition on the calendar. It was a chance to prove they belonged on bigger stages. Perform well here, and a big move could transpire. Several players have used the Club World Cup to boost their stock. Here are some of the names who turned their performances into transfers. - Brazilian clubs shine at Club World Cup, but what's next? And finally, he has made his move to Europe, joining Premier League side Wolverhampton Wanderers. It should probably be surprising that Arias has taken this long to cross the Atlantic. Fluminense signed him on the cheap in 2021, and perhaps even they were surprised by the progress he made in their colors. He excels at turning and surging away from his marker. He also combines well and hits a mean set piece, made apparent when he scored against South Korean side Ulsan HD last month with a superbly struck free kick. After showing that he belonged in such company, it was surprising that he did not move in the winter window and even more so when he stayed put through the next one, in the middle of 2024. To accommodate James Rodríguez, Arias was part of a disciplined midfield trio, highly effective in a much more restrictive role. Almost certainly because of his age (Arias turns 28 in September). The Club World Cup might have served as a reminder that this is not always be the best policy. Following Arias across the Atlantic is another Colombian with an interesting Brazilian backstory. Rangy and versatile, he soon became an important part of the side, and, together with Arias, forced his way into the Colombia lineup. Once again, the Club World Cup has worked its magic. There was interest from AS Roma, but Benfica have emerged victorious, luring the 25-year-old to Portugal. He is a fiery character, sometimes too much, as seen in a recent clash with his now-teammate and Argentina defender Nicolás Otamendi in a recent World Cup qualifier. He is also a fine striker of the ball, and for all the edge to his game, he has also shown his ability to knuckle down and play a supporting role to Rodriguez in the national team, like Arias. Indeed, his form for Colombia in last year's Copa América was arguably even more impressive than his displays for Palmeiras. Roma might have lost out in the race for Ríos, but they were able to get signature of Flamengo's fast right back, whose goal on July 17 in the 2-1 win over Red Bull Bragantino was seen as a farewell gesture. He is 21, making this more of a conventional South America-to-Europe transfer, but the Club World Cup did him little harm, even if it did highlight some of his defensive weaknesses. He was at fault for the goal that Pedro Neto scored for Chelsea in the group game, but responded well to his mistake and played a good second half as Flamengo emerged victorious against the eventual champions. He is at his best when going forward, where he can cut in toward the area, and his speed is also useful when running back to goal. Wesley agreed terms with Roma after turning down an advance from Zenit St. Petersburg of Russia. In the Club World Cup, he did something similar against vastly superior opposition, scoring the goal that brought a famous victory over reigning UEFA Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain. The 24-year-old is another to have taken a long and winding road. He began last year with Shabib Al Alhi in the United Arab Emirates, but Botafogo, with their excellent scouting system, had him on the radar and brought him back to Brazil on a free transfer in the middle of the year. They unleashed him in July when he was a relative unknown. But by September, he was starting for Brazil in World Cup qualification. It will be fascinating to follow his progress in the Premier League. An injury to the Angolan center back Bastos meant that Jair was thrown straight into the starting lineup, and with Botafogo going through a transitional time, things were not always easy. He was seen at his best in that Club World Cup triumph against PSG, where he hardly put a foot wrong. But he is still very much a work in progress. Against PSG, Botafogo defended close to their own goal. There were moments when he was bullied by tough center forwards, and he was not as dominant in the air as might be expected from a defender of his stature. Forest have been specialists at defending in a low block, which should suit him, but he might well need plenty of time on the training ground to get him up to scratch. Jair, then, has been signed more for promise than reality, which has been the recent template for many of the deals that European clubs have been doing in South America.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Following initial trial years of the tournament and in a friendly format, this will be the third official edition of a tournament that has steadily grown in importance and prominence. So far, there are only two champions: Inter Miami and Columbus Crew. The Herons, spearheaded by Lionel Messi, were the inaugural champions of this competition since it gained official status, defeating Nashville in a thrilling final decided by a penalty shoot-out. In last year's edition, Columbus Crew emerged victorious, overcoming Los Angeles FC 3-1 on home turf. The roll of honour is completed by Cruz Azul (2019) and Leon (2021), who were crowned champions when the tournament was not yet officially recognised. Teams from MLS and the Mexican League are increasingly competitive, even against European powerhouses. Clear evidence of this was seen in the recent Club World Cup, where as many as five Mexican and American teams participated (Monterrey, Pachuca, Los Angeles FC, Seattle Sounders and Inter Miami). In addition, Leon also qualified for the intercontinental event, and America contended for a place until the very last moment. This further demonstrates that the Leagues Cup is a tournament that has been steadily gaining prestige and is certain to deliver some major clashes. You can see the English version of BeSoccer.com.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite a very strong start to the summer transfer window, Chelsea are still looking to spend plenty more money before the September deadline. Renato Veiga is expected to leave this summer, while Ben Chilwell remains firmly out of the plans, leaving no obvious rotation option for Marc Cucurella. Earlier in the summer transfer window, there was strong interest in a new goalkeeper, with the likes of Mike Maignan and Gianluigi Donnarumma linked. While he was helpless up against three magnificent goals, he did make a stunning save to deny Liam Delap in the second half. WHAT A SAVE!Delap's shot beaten away by Donnarumma's brilliance. The Blues have put in a lot of work to fill the gaps in their squad this summer, however goalkeeper is one area where supporters would like strengthening. Donnarumma has previously been described as ‘superb' (OneFootball), and would bring much-needed top-level experience to a still young Chelsea side. Last season, it was reported that Maresca had lost confidence in Sanchez, and was looking to strengthen his options ahead of his second campaign in charge. Now, Maresca has given his backing to Sanchez ahead of the 2025/26 season, however this may well change if Chelsea make a move for one of the best goalkeepers in world football. With just one year left on his current deal, the Blues must test the waters to sign Donnarumma, however will be wary to make sure any signing fits into their current wage strategy.</p>

Bayern striker considering PL return

Bundesliga club may be willing to do business

Manchester United leading the race

Follow GOAL on WhatsApp! 🟢📱

Per the Telegraph, industry insiders believe that Kane may be available next summer, after the 2026 World Cup. The England captain's contract is said to have a clause that decreases each year, and Bayern may be willing to do business. The striker turned 32 this month and his contract expires in 2027.

Per the report, Manchester United are deemed the most likely to land Kane's signature if he does move next summer. Tottenham secured a first-option clause in the deal to sell Kane to Bayern but it would only kick in if the Bundesliga club agreed to sell him, and if the former Spurs star were willing to return to north London.

Kane has been remarkably consistent for Bayern since his arrival in 2023, scoring 85 goals in 96 games. He finally ended his long-running trophy drought last season as Bayern won the Bundesliga.

Bayern play Lyon in a pre-season friendly this weekend, and then play Tottenham on August 7.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Landon Donovan can't be sure he would have played international soccer had the World Cup not come to Pasadena in 1994, but he can say with certainty he wasn't aware what international soccer was until then. And Donovan is certain some of the people watching will be kids who, like him, will be inspired by their first up-close look at the global game. And it's not just one Donovan experienced himself, but a transformation he saw take place at the 2015 Women's World Cup final in Vancouver as well. “That's part of the reason why I'm critical or passionate about our team. It's because I understand what the opportunity is.” The criticism and passion Donovan is referencing are comments he made last month on the Unfiltered Soccer podcast he does with former USMNT teammate Tim Howard. In discussing the decision of players such as Christian Pulisic and Yunus Musah to pass up this summer's CONCACAF Gold Cup, the last major tournament before next year's World Cup, Donovan said their choice to take a “vacation” angered him. The comments seemed hypocritical since Donovan took his own well-chronicled sabbatical from the game in 2013, missing some World Cup qualifiers. And in his case the break helped, with Donovan returning to the national team that summer to get a career-high 24 points (on eight goals and eight assists) in 10 games, only one of which the U.S. lost. Pulisic said he needed both a mental and physical break after playing a career-high 3,650 minutes in all competitions for AC Milan last season and appearing in 118 games for club and country in the last 22 months. It was the timing he didn't like. “So my criticism was never with him or anyone taking a break. It was choosing when to take the break and from which team they were taking the break.” When Donovan took his respite he missed five games with the national team as well as training camp and five games with the Galaxy, which cost him the armband as captain and, he says, $1 million in salary. Pulisic, he argued, could have done the same, splitting his break between his club and the national team. “So it was never about taking a break. U.S. soccer coach Mauricio Pochettino coaxed overlooked players into fighting for their country, setting a higher standard for his World Cup roster. The idea of AC Milan giving Pulisic time off is a nonstarter, however. With Milan chasing a European tournament berth down the stretch, there was no time for rest so Pulisic started 12 games in the final 7½ weeks. He was on fumes when the final whistle sounded. So Donovan's comments seemed influenced more by wisdom and jealously than reality. And jealousy because for all that Donovan accomplished — he retired as the national team's all-time leader in goals, assists and starts and the MLS record-holder in goals, assists and championships — he never played a World Cup game at home. Pulisic, who turns 27 next month, will get that chance. “That would have been incredible to play a World Cup in your prime in your home country. And knowing two of the games are in L.A., that is literally a dream come true,” he said. I just don't want this opportunity to get wasted.” “There's a massive, massive wealth of talent here,” said Donovan, who speaks from experience after spending part of last week at a “dream team” tryout organized by Spanish club Real Madrid and Abbott, a global leader in the healthcare industry. “Some of those kids out there — 17, 18 years old — technically are better than guys I played with.” “The one area where we are still struggling is  in our development. It was eye-opening to watch some of these kids because I think we're missing out still on a lot of these players.” Next summer's World Cup can close that gap, provided we don't waste the opportunity. ⚽ You have read the latest installment of On Soccer with Kevin Baxter.

The biggest women's tournament is set to take place in Brazil, and some nations have already secured their spots in their respective World Cup qualifying competitions, which are scheduled to begin later this year and conclude in 2026. England extended their reign over Europe during their comeback run throughout the 2025 Euro and are now two-time Euro champions, while 2023 World Cup champions Spain had to settle for runners-up. The U.S. women's national team closed out their summer early, with a five-game win streak, pulling off victories against Canada, Ireland, Jamaica, and China. While the United States, England, and Spain are likely to form a "big three" in the globe, when it comes to teams sneaking into the rankings, any team can challenge another. Brazil has already qualified for the 2027 World Cup as host nation, but they're still on the hunt for another Copa America championship, but Uruguay, Colombia, and Argentina are hopeful to disrupt Brazil's run. The 2027 World Cup is 23 months away, and top national teams are locked into preparations for the long journey to Brazil. But where do they rank based on current form? Head coach Emma Hayes has mastered roster pool expansion and refining team identity by prioritizing the players and the overall long-term program goals. The USWNT returned to global prominence with their top podium finish in Paris, and under Hayes, remain the gold standard for performance, attacking prowess, and now tactical ability. There's no denying the incredible efforts England made to build on their program's history. They showed off another aspect of their program with resiliency under manager Sarina Wiegman, and a reminder that sometimes glory comes with a price, as defender Lucy Bronze played through a fractured tibia. They'll have a chance to make another statement during the upcoming UEFA Nations League, but their Euro performance showed once again they're a top side in the world. Their possession-based style with a midfield of maestros in Aitana Bonmati, Alexia Putellas, and Patri Guajirro will keep them elite. The group is building toward a home World Cup as Marta's presence is still a factor for the squad, and her legacy is inspiring a new generation of players. Although Lena Oberdorf has been sidelined as she works back from an ACL injury, Jule Brand, Klara Buhl, and Sjoeke Nüsken remain players to build the program around. Veteran Kosovare Asllani spoke up for her squad against critics and oddsmakers who underrated Sweden during the Euros, but unfortunately, the team squandered a two-goal lead in the quarterfinal against England, and they stay outside the top five of this ranking as well. Despite constantly being the obstacle in others' success stories, rather than having a trophy of their own, they're still a tough opponent who will remain a top-ten team with plenty of talent in the pipeline with Rosa Kafaji and Hanna Bennison. Their disciplined technicality on the ball makes them a challenging opponent to go up against, and their ability to share attacking responsibility offers a layer of unpredictability for defenders. Head coach Laurent Bonadei made a statement with his roster choices ahead of the Euros, leaving off veterans Eugénie Le Sommer and Wendie Renard, and another quarterfinal exit for France will just mean more questions around the team's ability in high-stakes tournaments. Hard to count out a team with exciting attacking talents in Delphine Cascarino, Marie Antoinette Katoto, and Sandy Baltimore, but consistency against top teams in the knockout rounds remains elusive. A group that caused England plenty of anxiety and troubles during the 2023 World Cup, despite being owed back-pay and a lack of resources, marched right back to the top of the Women's Afcon tournament this year. More official, governing body-type rankings likely won't have an African nation in the top ten, but that's not the case here. This team is sitting in last place and barely hanging on. They've got a hold because they have great players whose talents can determine the outcomes of games, and the federation managed to hire a solid coach in Casey Stoney to start the year. But the truth is they're a team that has somewhat regressed since their 2020 Tokyo Olympics gold medal run. Italy: The roster showed significant evolution under head coach Andrea Soncin. They defied expectations during the Euro with a mix of tactical awareness and key players stepping up as they bowed out of the semifinals against eventual tournament winners England. If they can work on defensive lapses and build on their tactics, they could leap into the top ten. Colombia: Las Chicas Superpoderosas aren't some imitation Powerpuff Girls, but a group who have emerged as bona fide continental figures for South America. They're currently on the hunt to take Brazil's crown in the Copa America, and with Chelsea FC's Mayra Ramirez and Real Madrid's Linda Caicedo, they could rival the crown and leap into our rankings. Netherlands: The Dutch look like an evaporating version of their 2017 Euro championship run. There is no gambling offered on this site.

Despite the setback, he flew with his team-mates to the United States to feature in the Club World Cup, but his participation in the tournament was cut short after suffering a relapse during training. He was also linked with a summer transfer, with Galatasaray and Fenerbahce after him, but he has since put the feud with Martinez behind him and declared his desire to stay at San Siro. He's worked hard this summer and is really hungry to bounce back. He was very disappointed in America for not being able to help the team. He tried in training and got hurt again. His expectations, and ours as well, were to have him for the second match. He's worked hard, and I saw him doing very well in the first training session."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA president Gianni Infantino spent much of the summer strolling around the U.S. at the Club World Cup, usually either following President Donald Trump or being followed by a group of football legends ready to declare how brilliant his latest idea is. But as players wilted in the heat and games were delayed by extreme weather conditions, some were keen to offer an alternative view. “What was presented as a global festival of football,” said a statement by Sergio Marchi, the president of global players' union FIFPro, “was nothing more than a fiction staged by FIFA, driven by its president, without dialogue, without sensitivity and without respect for those who sustain the game with their daily efforts.” It's the sort of thing you would expect a players' union to be vocal about, and ideally change. Which raises the question: why is it so hard for FIFPro, and other player unions, to gain traction in football? “FIFA's governance model allows them to do whatever they want,” Alex Phillips, FIFPro's secretary general, tells The Athletic. It's not just FIFA: this happens on a national level, and we see this quite a lot where the federation or the league don't like what the union is saying because they're challenging their power.” A perfect illustration of this came after Marchi's statement and the farcical situation where Infantino held a meeting to discuss the calendar issue, with some representatives from players' unions present, but not FIFPro. Apparent union members from Brazil, Spain, Ukraine, Mexico, Switzerland, Ivory Coast, Latvia, Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic were all present instead. FIFPro had been involved in some lower-level discussions about the football calendar, but were not invited to this more high-profile discussion. After that meeting, FIFA announced a consensus had been reached, that players must have at least 72 hours of rest between matches and there should be at least 21 days of rest at the end of each season. Which is fine (even though FIFPro says it should be at least 28 days at the end of each season), but the FIFA press release went on to say these stipulations “should be managed individually by each club and the respective players”. Why were FIFPro left out of a meeting like this? “He's simply a manager, not the owner of it. What's important are all the players around the world, and I've clearly told him this — I've said it to his face.” A FIFA statement on Friday read: “FIFA is extremely disappointed by the increasingly divisive and contradictory tone adopted by FIFPro leadership as this approach clearly shows that, rather than engaging in constructive dialogue, FIFPro has chosen to pursue a path of public confrontation driven by artificial PR battles — which have nothing to do with protecting the welfare of professional players, but rather aim to preserve their own personal positions and interests. It also said FIFA are looking to introduce measures whereby players and player unions are represented in FIFA's standing committees and the possibility of them participating in FIFA Council meetings when players' matters are being addressed. FIFA sources, speaking anonymously to protect relationships, also said that the world governing body “made a genuine effort to engage” with Marchi and FIFPro's new leadership when welcoming them to FIFA headquarters in Zurich in January of this year. For anyone used to observing how unions work in American sports, all of this would seem very strange. In America, most sports literally cannot go ahead without a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) being reached, something negotiated between the league and the players' unions. The NFL also suffered a player lockout in 2011 over a variety of issues, although that was confined to the off-season and no actual games were lost. One of the main reasons for this is those big U.S. sports are closed markets, operating in a single country. There are places other than America for baseball or basketball or hockey, but the elite level is so far above everything else that it's essentially the only place to play. In football, it's very different: a player can go almost anywhere they want, which is broadly a positive, but reduces leverage when it comes to disputes with the governing powers. By which I mean players — and I use the word assets on purpose because that's how the players are treated. So you'll have UEFA adding extra games to the Champions League, or creating a new competition such as the Conference League, while FIFA is conjuring the Club World Cup out of thin air, or adding more teams (and thus more games) to the proper World Cup. Throw in clubs shoehorning pre- and post-season tours into the schedule whenever they can, and it becomes like multiple children adding items on to the Buckaroo! mule, with little care given to anything around them. “They all have their own calendar, which make sense when you look at them individually, but they don't make any sense when you look at them holistically because they don't talk to each other,” adds Molango. We should make clear that the unions are busy with other things as well. Phillips cites an issue raised by The Athletic recently, about the number of former players going bankrupt, which is something unions help with, along with other post-career services. Industrial action from players has been mentioned in passing, as vague threats around certain issues. In September 2024, Rodri said that strikes were “close” in protest against the overwhelming international calendar, and that players will have “no other option” if more games keep being added. That was particularly notable because he was speaking a few days before he was ruled out for the remainder of the season after damaging ligaments in his knee: it can't be definitively proven that this was a consequence of him playing 67 games for club and country over the preceding year, but such a workload can't have helped. But no large-scale, international strikes have materialised, partly because it's incredibly difficult. That's enough to give any lawyer a headache. Will anyone in the latter group be willing to risk their own positions, risk their own money, essentially, for something that might not really impact them? It's possible to take industrial action on individual, national levels — Colombian players, for example, voted to strike earlier this year — but on an international scale, which is the sort of level that you would need to really make FIFA jump, is impractical. “We don't have players as members,” says Phillips, “so we can't call players and say go on strike because our members are national player unions and national player associations.” In any case, conversations with those involved in the unions suggest there really isn't the appetite to treat strikes as anything other than a final, final step. “No worker wants to stop working and not get paid,” says Phillips, “so it's a final resort when negotiations fail.” There perhaps lies one area where the unions could be doing more. Conversations with players past and present, kept anonymous to allow them to protect relationships, suggested that most weren't unhappy with the work their unions did, but felt they could be more proactive, more confrontational, even, with the authorities. “The number of issues that could lead to strikes are limited, however those are issues that are so easy for players to feel the consequences of that you shouldn't discount anything. Marchi, who, as we've established, is not shy about talking a good game, will perhaps help the perception that the unions are too soft. But ultimately influence, without resorting to strike action, is what the unions are there for — and what FIFPro is looking for. “We have a good relationship with FIFA on an operational level in most departments, but we don't have any decision-making power,” says Phillips. “And that's what we're fighting for — to have a say at the top table, on issues that directly affect players' rights. To have a veto so that we would negotiate those rights, as happens on a national level, together with the clubs. “We need a change in the decision-making process, and U.S. sports are way ahead of us on that because the players have an equal say on the big issues that affect professional players.” (Top photo: Robert Sanchez cools down with a towel in a hydration break during the FIFA Club World Cup; Photo by Steph Chambers – FIFA/FIFA via Getty Images) He previously worked as a freelancer for the Guardian, ESPN and Eurosport, plus anyone else who would have him.</p>

Philadelphia Soccer 2026 on Monday unveiled its volunteer center location in the Fashion District in Center City for next summer's FIFA World Cup. It will serve as the headquarters for volunteer registration and training as well as a transit hub distributing volunteers to Lincoln Financial Field in South Philadelphia, the Fan Festival in Lemon Hill and transportation sites like 30th Street Station and Philadelphia International Airport. “The center will not only help power critical volunteer efforts supporting FIFA World Cup 26 but also generate significant economic activity for our local businesses, restaurants, and hotels. We are proud to support this effort and the thousands of volunteers who will ensure that next summer's tournament is a success.” That number will be augmented by other programs, like SEPTA's ambassadors and the Philadelphia Visitor Center's Phambassadors program, to move the number to more than 4,000 volunteers. The city has put aside 3,100 parking spots for World Cup-associated traffic. Though dates are not formally set, the application process via FIFA is slated to open in August and run into the fall, with approvals starting in October. “The Fashion District is an ideal location for FIFA World Cup 26 Philadelphia to welcome and serve the thousands of volunteers who will make the games one of Philadelphia's most successful events in history and a showcase for our city and region,” said Michelle Singer, board co-chair, Philadelphia Soccer 2026. Volunteers can walk, take public transit or drive, and it is located just blocks away from the country's most historical sites and the city's economic center. There really is no better site to base our large volunteer effort and I am glad we were able to secure it.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mauricio Pochettino's preparations for the 2026 FIFA World Cup are well underway as the U.S. men's national team head coach scouts in preseason. He also was a prominent figure in his playing days at the latter. Stealing headlines for USMNT fans was Damion Downs. Mauricio Pochettino and the #USMNT coaching staff scouted the Southampton-Espanyol match today and saw Damion Downs score his first goal for his new club! FC Köln to EFL Championship side Southampton this summer signing a four-year deal with the Saints. The 21-year-old was born in Germany but held dual citizenship in the U.S. given his father is American and his mother German. Downs previously represented Germany at the U-20 level, but he made his USMNT senior debut this past summer in the Concacaf Gold Cup after receiving his first call-up. Pochettino's appearance at the game adds further fuel to an ongoing debate around who should start at striker this summer, a position under heavy scrutiny by fans and pundits alike. It didn't take long for Downs to impress the Southampton fans in attendance, manager Will Still and his national team coach in his preseason debut. Off the mark on his first appearance 🔥 The second division in England features Josh Sargent at Norwich City, Haji Wright of Coventry City and Gold Cup teammate Patrick Agyemang who moved to Derby County this summer from Charlotte FC. With Downs playing a role in the Gold Cup amid notable senior absences this summer and Pochettino's appearance, perhaps the Southampton striker could force the head coach to include him in his 2026 plans if he kicks on this season. Max Mallow is an editor for Sports Illustrated FC. Somehow, he has just enough time every matchday to tweet when an Arsenal player scores a goal.
