Zohran Mamdani's staunch support for Palestinian rights was a major boon to his campaign and served as one of the top motivations for voters to cast their ballot for him, new polling finds, providing evidence that opposing Israel's genocide in Gaza is a winning position as establishment Democrats scratch their heads over Mamdani's historic campaign and popularity. This includes a whopping 83 percent of new voters who said as such, the poll found. The polling additionally found that New York primary voters overwhelmingly oppose Israel's assault, with 78 percent saying that Israel is committing a genocide; 79 percent saying that they support restricting weapons shipments to Israel; and 63 percent saying that they would support the mayor arresting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he visits the city, as Mamdani has pledged to do. The poll results vastly undercut claims by establishment Democrats that Israel's genocide in Gaza doesn't matter to the electorate, or that supporting Palestinian rights would be unpopular. Since Mamdani's win, establishment New York Democrats have refused to endorse Mamdani, instead trying and failing to drum up controversy over the phrase “globalize the intifada,” which he never said. Democrats, who have spent millions on trying to rehabilitate their image, are flailing in trying to come up with any explanation but Mamdani's democratic socialist stances for his win. Just on Monday, for instance, Pete Buttigieg — a potential contender for the 2028 Democratic presidential nominee — said that it wasn't Mamdani's ideology, but rather his campaign strategies that delivered his win. “I think if my party wants to learn lessons from Mamdani's success that are portable to a place like Michigan, where I live, it's less about the ideology and more about the message discipline of focusing on what people care about,” Buttigieg said. The polling shows that Buttigieg is flat-out wrong, with voters ranking Mamdani's social media presence, ads, and canvassing campaign the lowest among their reasons for voting for him. Ignoring Gaza specifically has been shown, in fact, to be a losing position for Democrats. A YouGov poll found earlier this year that the Gaza genocide was the top reason for not voting in the 2024 presidential election among those who didn't cast a ballot, proving a major contribution to Kamala Harris's embarrassing loss to Donald Trump. New polling released Tuesday by Gallup finds that support for Israel's genocide in Gaza has hit a new low in the U.S., with now less than a third of Americans, 32 percent, saying they back it. This poll was largely conducted before Israel's starvation campaign made headlines last week, meaning that the difference could be even starker now. Democrats seeking higher turnout or more support should take note, with Gallup finding that now only 8 percent of Democratic voters support the genocide, down from 36 percent in October 2023.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It will bring predictability”, said EU President Ursula von der Leyen at Donald Trump's Turnberry golf resort in Scotland on Sunday. But when you lead an economic bloc that has just been comprehensively outmanoeuvred in a trade dispute, forced into a deal that even your own side says favours the US, you could be forgiven for acting out of character. The basic rate of 15 per cent that will now be charged on most European goods entering the US was perhaps not coincidentally the same rate that Trump had extracted from Japan in a similar deal last week. It is the same rate that could, pending an announced review, become a new general norm in US foreign trade relations. It was “the best we could get”, von der Leyen said almost apologetically in a news conference after the deal was announced. Indeed, a hard US-imposed deadline to conclude negotiations loomed on August 1, only four days after the agreement was reached. Without the deal, US tariffs on EU imports, which form about 20 per cent of the US's total foreign purchases, would have shot up to 30 per cent across the board, with high levies on automobiles, pharmaceuticals, and other key industries in which the EU has a competitive advantage left painfully in place. In other words, Trump appears to be winning his trade war. The president has secured commitments for considerable new investment in the US from a range of trading partners, alongside a more level playing field for American exporters. “Questions, critiques and discrepancies are hanging over the framework agreement,” declared a sceptical New York Times analysis, apparently written by seven reporters, who accused the deal of having “drawn plenty of grumbling” from critics just hours after its announcement. On Monday, a follow-up New York Times article warned that the tariffs could inflict higher prices for Botox, Ozempic, and other cosmetic drugs. One could argue that the former paper of record, as it is often called, knows its remaining audience, but that same day it also unironically published an article observing that doctoral graduates in economics, an academic field overwhelmingly critical of Trump's tariffs, now face poor employment prospects. In fairness, on Tuesday, it did acknowledge that the slew of deals “has seemingly proved Mr Trump right that his tariff threats are a powerful bargaining tool”, but it couldn't resist casting doubt on whether they would prove an economic success. Pointing out that EU investment increased by about $200bn from 2023 to 2024, it joylessly observed that “those investment inflows will increase the US trade deficit because of balance-of-payments accounting”. Perhaps some of these criticisms will be proven correct. Not all observers are so down in the mouth. “The stock market is at record highs … I don't see a country in a depression … And I would have thought … that these tariffs were going to f‑--ing sink this economy by this time, and they didn't,” admitted the liberal American comedian and political commentator Bill Maher, a sometime Trump critic who has a record of giving the president credit when it is due. If the rest of the news media wants to recover ground among the 69 per cent of Americans who say they place little or no faith in it, its practitioners should recognise a good thing when they see it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trolleys piled high with decapitated silicon monster heads, tattooed dealers lurking in alleyways, bin bags of contraband hidden behind shop counters: welcome to the world of Lafufus. Fake Labubus, also known as Lafufus, are flooding the hidden market. As demand for the collectable furry keyrings soars, entrepreneurs in the southern trading hub of Shenzhen are wasting no time sourcing imitation versions to sell to eager Labubu hunters. “Labubus have become very sensitive,” says one unofficial vendor, in her small, unmarked, fake designer goods shop hidden on the 17th floor of a bland office building in Shenzhen's Huaqiangbei district, an area known for cheap electronics. “We don't dare to talk about it,” her colleague adds. Labubus, a furry bunny-eared elf sold by Chinese toy company Pop Mart, have gone viral this year. In the UK they retail for £17.50, while official versions in China sell for between 99 and 399 yuan (£10.30 – £41.40), with resale prices soaring much higher. About 40km (25 miles) across town from the Huaqiangbei store, 59-year-old Li Yang* has never heard of a “Labubu”. But she spends hours each day sitting on a low plastic stool in her high-rise apartment building slicing apart hundreds of moulded silicon monster heads that will later become Lafufus. Surrounded by piles of flesh-coloured components, Li and her neighbour, Wang Bi*, another stay-at-home grandmother engaged in the painstaking work, spilled out into the hallway of their apartments. Li didn't know where the monster heads came from or were sent back to. “China has never been so determined to fix IP [intellectual property] thefts, thanks to Labubu's contribution not just as a global bestselling toy but as a soft power tool,” said Yaling Jiang, a Chinese consumer trends analyst. Authorities in Shenzhen's Huaqiangbei recently said they would be inspecting vendors for “counterfeit and shoddy” Labubus. But it doesn't take long to find a dealer. After a quick phone call made by one of the street-side vendors hawking fake designer bags and watches, a slight, tattooed man, his canvas tote bag dripping in cutesy furry keyrings, appeared out of nowhere. With a few furtive glances, the smartly dressed shop assistant whipped out a black plastic bag from behind the counter, full of Lafufus, for sale for 168 yuan (£17.40) each. But Li's business model works like this: every few days, a courier wheels over a trolley piled with bags stuffed with hundreds of moulded monster heads to Li's apartment building. The heads are moulded by a machine, but the act of splitting them into two, so that they can be stuffed and reassembled into a finished toy, is fiddly. So Li and her neighbours, all elderly women, are enlisted to slice the heads by hand, with the mystery factory paying them 0.04 yuan a piece. Every time the courier arrives, Li hauls down several large bags of split-open heads, and collects a new batch of elfin models, ready for dissection. One woman estimated she can cut through 800-1,000 heads a day, earning up to 40 yuan. Wang was shocked to hear that the finished products, fake or otherwise, sold for several hundred yuan. As Li's young granddaughter wandered into the hallway to find her grandmother inspecting a finished toy, she screamed: “Labubu!”.</p>

Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. A permanent U.S. resident has been held in detention for the last week without apparent explanation and without access to legal representation, The Washington Post reported on Tuesday. According to the Post, 40-year-old Tae Heung “Will” Kim was detained by immigration officials at the San Francisco International Airport on July 21 after returning from attending his brother's wedding in Korea. Eric Lee, an attorney representing Kim, said he has been unable to contact his client and that Kim's only past brush with the law came back in 2011 when he was ordered to perform community service over a minor marijuana possession charge in Texas. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. “If a green-card holder is convicted of a drug offense, violating their status, that person is issued a Notice to Appear and CBP coordinates detention space with ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] ERO [Enforcement and Removal Operations],” they said. “If the Constitution doesn't apply to somebody who's lived in this country for 35 years and is a green-card holder — and only left the country for a two-week vacation — that means [the government] is basically arguing that the Constitution doesn't apply to anybody who's been in this country for less time than him,” Lee said. Lee added that it would be particularly uncommon for immigration officials to deport his client based solely on a 2011 marijuana possession charge given that Kim had successfully petitioned to seal the offense from his public record after fulfilling his community service requirements. Immigration enforcement officials under the second Trump administration have been particularly aggressive in trying to deport students who are legally in the United States. Turkish-born Tufts University student Rümeysa Öztürk was detained for months earlier this year after she was apparently targeted for writing an editorial in her student newspaper critical of the school's refusal to divest from Israel. Russian-born Harvard University scientist Kseniia Petrova, meanwhile, is currently facing deportation after she was charged with allegedly smuggling frog embryos into the United States.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Starmer's tougher line: British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said today the UK will recognize a Palestinian state in September unless Israel takes “substantive steps to end the appalling situation in Gaza” and to reach a ceasefire. “Famine thresholds reached”: The “worst-case scenario” of famine is unfolding in Gaza, according to an alert issued today by a UN-backed food security body. • Trump promises aid: US President Donald Trump said he is “working together” with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to get things “straightened out” in the Middle East. • Death toll climbs:  More than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel's war on Hamas began nearly two years ago, Gaza's health ministry said today. • Genocide accusations: A pair of leading Israeli human rights groups accused Israel of “committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.” An Israeli government spokesperson dismissed the report, saying, “We have free speech in this country but we strongly reject this claim.” Israel said Tuesday it rejects British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's announcement that the United Kingdom would recognize a Palestinian state unless Israel meets certain conditions. Some context: Starmer said today the UK will recognize a Palestinian state in September unless Israel takes “substantive steps to end the appalling situation in Gaza” and to reach a ceasefire. Starmer has been facing mounting pressure from within his Labour Party to take a tougher line on Israel, made more acute after French President Emmanuel Macron's recent announcement that France would recognize a Palestinian state in September, becoming the first G7 country to do so. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said aid from the UK was air-dropped into Gaza on Tuesday. The UK aid airdrop comes a day after Germany and France said they would send humanitarian assistance to Gaza in coordination with France and the UK. Israel said last week it would allow aid to be air-dropped into Gaza, despite the United Nations warning that would be expensive, inefficient and dangerous. Moments after the roar of Israeli jet engines signaled a new missile strike was imminent, huge plumes of dark smoke rose from the impact. Across several hours Tuesday, a CNN team around the Israeli city of Sderot, which is along Gaza border, heard and saw at least a dozen missile impacts in northern Gaza. Any aid convoys heading into northern Gaza on Tuesday afternoon would need to navigate the conflict. In the five hours this CNN team spent driving along semi-arid farmland close to Gaza's northern border, no trucks carrying aid were sighted. Israel “hasn't stopped trying” to work out a ceasefire deal with Hamas since its delegation returned from talks in Qatar last week, Netanyahu said. Some context: Last week, the United States and Israel recalled their negotiating teams from Qatar, where discussions had been taking place, with Witkoff saying the latest response from Hamas “clearly shows a lack of desire to reach a ceasefire.” France commended the UK for its plan to recognize Palestinian statehood in September if Israel doesn't meet certain conditions, which comes days after French President Emmanuel Macron announced his country would do so. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said earlier Tuesday that the UK would recognize a Palestinian state in September unless Israel takes “substantive steps to end the appalling situation in Gaza” and to reach a ceasefire. UK's foreign secretary: British Foreign Secretary David Lammy reiterated the prime minister's statements on Tuesday, saying the United Kingdom will recognize a Palestinian state if Israel doesn't end its military campaign in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the decision would “reward terror,” and his defense minister described it as a “disgrace, a surrender to terror.” British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the UK will recognize a Palestinian state in September unless Israel takes “substantive steps to end the appalling situation in Gaza” and to reach a ceasefire. Starmer has been facing mounting pressure from within his Labour Party to take a tougher line on Israel, made more acute after French President Emmanuel Macron's recent announcement that France would recognize a Palestinian state in September, becoming the first G7 country to do so. US Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and dozens of other Senate Democrats sent a letter Tuesday to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff demanding the expansion of humanitarian aid in Gaza and continued diplomatic efforts to end the war. “To prevent the situation from getting even worse, we urge you to advocate for a large-scale expansion of humanitarian assistance and services throughout the Gaza Strip, including through the use of experienced multilateral bodies and NGOs that can get life-saving aid directly to those in need and prevent diversion,” they added. If you're just joining our coverage, here are the latest developments we're reporting today in Gaza: France is also working to deliver aid via land, the foreign ministry said, though this would require Israel to open more border crossings, something it has rejected in the past. It called on Israel “to open all crossing points and for immediate, massive and unhindered access for humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip by land.” Last year, France, working with Jordan, airdropped food and hygiene kits into the Gaza Strip. We reported earlier on how Spain and Germany announced yesterday they would be arranging airdrops into the enclave with the help of Jordan. Fifty-two aid packages have been airdropped into Gaza today in coordination with Arab nations, the Israeli military said. US President Donald Trump has been speaking today about Gaza. He told reporters in Scotland that said he is “working together” with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to get things “straightened out” in the Middle East. The comment came shortly after he inaugurated a new golf course at one of his resorts. An increasing number of Palestinians in Gaza are starving to death as tons of food, clean water and medical supplies sit just outside the territory's borders, and aid agencies have warned that Gaza is as close to famine as it's ever been. For months, the United Nations has said that Palestinians are facing critical levels of acute food insecurity, and on Tuesday the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) initiative said that “the worst-case scenario of famine is unfolding.” Of 74 malnutrition-related deaths in 2025, 63 occurred in July – including 24 children under 5, a child over 5, and 38 adults, the World Health Organization (WHO) said this week, noting that the situation was “entirely preventable,” while pointing to Israel's blockade on aid. “I don't know what you would call it other than mass starvation, and it's man-made, and that's very clear,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has denied that Palestinians in Gaza face starvation. Two of those thresholds have been reached in Gaza already, the IPC said Tuesday, adding that a new analysis is underway. “Many people will have died by the time a famine is declared,” it added. More than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel's war on Hamas began nearly two years ago, the health ministry said today. The announcement comes as hopes dim for a ceasefire anytime soon, after talks broke up last week without an agreement. It also comes amid a deepening starvation crisis in Gaza due to Israeli restrictions on aid, and growing international condemnation of Israel's conduct in the war. But it has long argued that figures from the Hamas-controlled health ministry are exaggerated, and that Hamas embeds itself between civilians, using them as “human shields.” Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar said on Tuesday that international pressure on Israel “has already caused Hamas to harden its position” in ceasefire talks. “This pressure is directly sabotaging the chances for a ceasefire and hostage deal,” Sa'ar told reporters. Last week, the United States and Israel recalled their negotiating teams from Qatar, where discussions had been taking place, with US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff saying the latest response from Hamas “clearly shows a lack of desire to reach a ceasefire.” The Netherlands declared two Israeli ministers persona non grata on Monday, according to a letter written by Dutch foreign minister Caspar Veldkamp. Smotrich responded with a post on X, writing that the “safety” of Israel is “far more important.” “Even if I'm banned from entering all of Europe, I will continue to act for our country and demand that we dismantle Hamas and support our soldiers,” he said. In a place where terrorism is tolerated and terrorists are welcomed, a Jewish minister from Israel is unwelcome, terrorists roam free, and Jews are boycotted,” he continued. Returning now to yesterday's publication of two reports by two Israeli human rights groups who have accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza. Tirza Leibowitz, Deputy Director and Director of Programs, Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHRI), said her organization felt they “owed it to humanity” to call Israel's war in Gaza a genocide. Both PHRI and B'Tselem, another leading human rights group, accused Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, becoming the first such organizations inside Israel to make the claim. It is something that we owe in terms of solidarity with the Palestinian people and with our medical colleagues in Gaza as well.” In a separate major report released Monday, B'Tselem said it came to that “unequivocal conclusion” that Israel was committing a genocide after an “examination of Israel's policy in the Gaza Strip and its horrific outcomes, together with statements by senior Israeli politicians and military commanders about the goals of the attack.” “Given the most recent information and data made available, a new IPC analysis is to be conducted without delay,” it said. More than 20,000 children were admitted for treatment for acute malnutrition between April and mid-July, the IPC said, with more than 3,000 severely malnourished. Germany and Spain are sending humanitarian assistance to Gaza, although top officials from both countries acknowledged the aid isn't enough. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Defense Minister Boris Pistorius will coordinate with France and the UK, who he said are also prepared to provide airlifts for food and medical supplies. CNN has reached out to the French and UK governments for comment. “We know that this can only be a very small help for the people in Gaza, but at least it is a contribution that we are happy to make,” Merz said. Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares Bueno also said his country would arrange aid airdrops in the next few days in coordination with Jordan. “Some airdrops with food stuff, but that's just a drop of water in the ocean,” he told CNN's Isa Soares. Spain plans to air-drop food aid for approximately 5,000 people into Gaza between the first and second week of August. However, the minister emphasized, “This is not what we want. Calling for land access and distribution through United Nations agencies, the minister said there needs to be a permanent flow of aid, “unimpeded, without any obstacles.” Israel will continue working with global aid agencies, as well as the United States and European countries, “to ensure that large amounts of humanitarian aid flows into the Gaza Strip,” the office of Israel's prime minister said yesterday. “As part of this effort, Israel paused IDF operations in key populated areas of Gaza from 10am to 8pm every day and designated secure routes from 6am to 11pm that will ensure the safe passage of more convoys delivering aid,” the statement said. That is the only way to secure peace for Israelis and Palestinians alike.” The statement reiterated accusations against Hamas of stealing humanitarian aid for which it provided no evidence. The analysis, conducted by the US Agency for International Development (USAID), looked into 156 incidents of waste, fraud, and abuse reported by partner organizations between October 2023 and May 2025.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Russian T-14 Armata tank participates in a Victory Day Parade night rehearsal on Tverskaya Street in Moscow, Russia, on May 4, 2022. As Ukraine and its Western allies continue to sound the alarm about Moscow's long-term intentions, Russian lawmakers introduced a bill on July 22 that would allow year-round conscription. The development comes after recent Ukrainian warnings of a massive increase in Russian rearmament spending, and the creation last year of new military districts which experts say are potential preparations for future wars outside of Ukraine. "All of these components — new military districts, changes in mobilization and defence spending — are suggesting that Russia is preparing for a protracted war, not just in Ukraine but also against NATO," Kateryna Stepanenko, Russia deputy team lead and analyst at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), told the Kyiv Independent. To maintain this force, the Kremlin currently conducts conscription twice a year, in spring and fall, requiring eligible men to serve for one year. "If this law is passed, it can be considered a stealth mobilization." But the Kremlin appears to be now taking at least partial steps towards this. "Russia over the past couple of years has been dedicating a lot of resources and time to changing its mobilization system, digitizing it, making it more comprehensive, and investing lots of money into military patriotic education," Stepanenko said. "If this law is passed, it can be considered a stealth mobilization," Ukrainian defense expert, Denys Popovych, told the Kyiv Independent. "There is a 99% chance that this law will be passed, because it was submitted by (Andriy) Kartopolov, who is (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's man, his mouthpiece. These changes in mobilization laws are, according to Kyiv, being accompanied by dramatic defense spending plans. According to Ukraine's intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, Moscow plans to spend $1.1 trillion on rearmament by 2036, an unprecedented investment since the collapse of the Soviet Union. "There is a total mobilization of politics, economy, and society of the Russian Federation to be ready for the upcoming large-scale war," Budanov said during the annual meeting of Ukrainian ambassadors on July 22. "The Kremlin's theory of victory is that it can outlast Western support and Ukrainian resistance." Asked why Budanov specifically mentioned the year 2036, Stepanenko believes that this date aligns with the Kremlin's tendency to avoid abrupt or sudden decisions, understanding that a rapid and general mobilization of the population or a sudden pivot to increase defense spending could "upset the Russian people." "I think mobilization is probably the most concerning issue for Russians, as many of them are extremely worried about being mobilized or having family members mobilized," she said. The Kremlin's theory of victory is that it can outlast Western support and Ukrainian resistance." "Russia's budget is currently bursting at the seams," Popovych said. "Many industries and transport sectors have collapsed due to sanctions. Currently, Western sanctions against Russia are still in place, and the EU has just announced its 18th package.Russia's defense spending has already overtaken that of all European countries combined. In 2024, its military budget surged by 42% to $462 billion, surpassing Europe's collective defense expenditure of $457 billion, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies. "One of the Kremlin's objectives is to defeat NATO, seize Ukraine and Belarus, and restore the Russian empire — then become a world hegemon." "It does seem that Russia is trying to establish some sort of wartime economy. There are a couple of indications besides the increase in things ending on defense," Stepanenko said. According to Stepanenko, the Kremlin is pursuing a strategy of deeper nationalization and centralization to sustain and scale military production. "The Kremlin is currently trying to prepare Russians to embrace more economic setbacks and more economic sacrifices in favor of this kind of long-term defense spending," Stepanenko said. Some regional governments are beginning to prioritize defense spending and military contracts, even if it means reducing civilian programs. "Russia will save money by cutting social spending to develop its military-industrial sector. "The Kremlin is posing itself as the new world power, so it's trying to expand its influence in Latin America, Asia, and Africa," she said. "One of the Kremlin's objectives is to defeat NATO, seize Ukraine and Belarus, and restore the Russian empire — then become a world hegemon." And some Western leaders are taking the threat seriously — Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on July 25 that Russia will likely be ready for a potential military confrontation with Europe within the next two years.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three-page document left at scene appears to provide motive for mass shooting spree that killed four His body was found on the 33rd floor of the 44-storey building and is understood to have died from a self-inflicted injury. The body was found with a note that suggested he was suffering from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a brain condition linked to repeated trauma to the head. The three-page note reportedly suggested that Tamura's condition may have been linked to playing football in high school. “Terry Long football gave me CTE and it caused me to drink a gallon of antifreeze,” Tamura wrote, according to CNN, in an apparent reference to the Pittsburgh Steelers player, who took his own life by drinking antifreeze in 2006, after suffering from the same condition. “You can't go against the NFL, they'll squash you,” the note continued, “study my brain please I'm sorry Tell Rick I'm sorry for everything.” His body was found on the 33rd floor of the 44-storey building and is understood to have died from a self-inflicted injury. Ms Tisch added that the gunman was believed to have acted alone, and investigators had yet to determine a possible motive for the shooting, though she believed he had a “documented mental health history”. In the past few days, the former high school football player had driven from Las Vegas – where he was a registered gun owner – to New York, via Colorado, Nebraska, Iowa and New Jersey. Tamura did not appear to have ever played football professionally or at college, CNN reported. Preliminary checks of the suspect's background did not show a significant criminal history, according to CNN, citing officials. He then moved through the lobby, “spraying” it with gunfire and hitting multiple people, including a security guard who was hiding behind a desk, and another man. The police commissioner added that Tamura then called a lift. He went up to the 33rd floor, where Ruden Building Management is located. Videos shared online showed officers in protective gear entering the building at 365 Park Avenue with their guns drawn. Inside the building, office workers barricaded doors using sofas and other office furniture stacked floor to ceiling in an effort to prevent the shooter from entering. The skyscraper at 345 Park Avenue houses a number of other financial firms, including KPMG and Deutsche Bank. He was described by the city's mayor as a heroic Bangladeshi immigrant who saved lives while “putting his life on the line”. “We lost four souls to another senseless act of gun violence, including a member of the New York City Police Department, Officer Islam,” Eric Adams, the mayor of New York, told reporters. “He loved this city, and everyone we spoke with stated he was a person of faith and a person that believed in God.” Mr Adams said he met the officer's family on Monday night. “I told them that he was a hero, and we admire him for putting his life on the line,” the mayor added. Mr Islam was married, had two young sons, and his wife is pregnant with a third child. The gunman mistakenly went to Rudin Management's offices, Mr Adams said. The note alluded to that he felt he had CTE, a known brain injury for those who participate in contact sports. It is understood that one of the victims was killed on the 33rd floor, which Tamura is said to have mistakenly entered. Office worker Shad Sakib told AFP that he was packing his things to leave work when a public address announcement warned him and his colleagues to shelter in place. “Everyone was confused with like, ‘Wait, what's going on?' Another witness told AFP: “I was in the building. Some finance workers at an office building down the block were picking up dinner at a corner eatery when they heard a loud noise and saw people running. “It was like a crowd panic,” said Anna Smith, who joined the workers pouring back into the finance office building. A short time later, Ms Tisch said on X: “At this time, the scene has been contained and the lone shooter has been neutralised.” New York's senators, Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, who are both Democrats, posted on social media that they were praying for those affected by the shooting. “We must do more to stop gun violence in America,” Mr Schumer wrote. In a post on Truth Social, President Donald Trump said: “I have been briefed on the tragic shooting that took place in Manhattan, a place that I know and love. “I trust our Law Enforcement Agencies to get to the bottom of why this crazed lunatic committed such a senseless act of violence.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thirty-one high-profile Israelis accuse Tel Aviv of ‘brutal campaign' and demand permanent ceasefire in letter A group of high-profile Israeli public figures, including academics, artists and public intellectuals, has called for “crippling sanctions” to be imposed by the international community on Israel, amid mounting horror over its starvation of Gaza. It adds: “The international community must impose crippling sanctions on Israel until it ends this brutal campaign and implements a permanent ceasefire.” The letter is significant both for its unvarnished criticism of Israel and for breaking the taboo of endorsing stringent international sanctions, in a country where politicians have promoted laws targeting those advocating such measures. The letter was published as it was announced that more than 60,000 Palestinians had been killed in the 21-month Israel-Gaza war, according to Gaza's health ministry. On Monday two well-known Israeli human rights groups, B'Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights Israel, released reports assessing for the first time that Israel was conducting a “genocidal” policy against Palestinians in Gaza, breaking another taboo. No one should spend the bulk of their time arguing technical definitions between starvation and pervasive hunger. Nor should we accept arguments that because Hamas is the primary reason many Gazans are either starving or on the verge of starving, that the Jewish state is not also culpable in this human disaster. “Blocking food, water, medicine, and power – especially for children – is indefensible,” it said. Let us rise to the moral challenge of this moment.” The latest interventions follow comments earlier this month by the former Israel prime minister Ehud Olmert, who told the Guardian that a “humanitarian city” Israel's defence minister has proposed building on the ruins of Rafah would be a concentration camp, and forcing Palestinians inside would amount to ethnic cleansing. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, officials and rightwing NGOs have continued to deny the existence of famine in Gaza caused by Israel.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From the first days of Russia's full-scale invasion, Western leftists have invoked “peace” as a slogan — as if peace were not already at the heart of every Ukrainian's daily prayer. For Ukraine's own leftists, though, the prospect of total annihilation has laid bare how hollow abstract pacifism sounds when survival itself is on the line. When Russian forces tried to take Kyiv in 2022, Ukrainian writer Artem Chapeye — a well-known leftist and outspoken male feminist — made sure his family reached safety before he enlisted to defend his country. In his latest book "Ordinary People Don't Carry Machine Guns," translated into English by Zenia Tompkins and published by Seven Stories Press, Chapeye reflects on his path to military service, the ways in which the war has upended parts of Ukrainian society, and what it means to hold onto your humanity when forced to pick up a weapon. “But what if one of your brothers is sitting with his wife in a corridor in February 2022 on the outskirts of Kyiv, with gunfire all around and Russian armored vehicles already driving by the building, and he is panicking when he realizes that he doesn't even have an axe in his apartment, nothing to defend himself with other than kitchen knives and a meat tenderizer? Chapeye's inner conflict with his longstanding pacifism unfolds when he and his family stop by a village heading westward and he meets an elderly local. When Chapeye asks the son if he can give his family a ride to continue their journey westward, he replies that he doesn't want to be stopped at a military checkpoint. Ukrainian writer and soldier Artem Chapeye attends the 13th International Book Arsenal Festival in Kyiv, Ukraine, on May 30, 2025. Chapeye's writing resists easy blame when it comes to such social issues, always choosing instead to look deeply, contextualize, and find empathy, if possible. On the son's choice, he says: “I just wouldn't want that to be me.” “I struggle more with the men who have bought documents claiming a fake disability or obtained a fake guardianship of a disabled person and now sip beer from bottles with ‘Heroes don't die' on the labels,” he adds. Chapeye approaches such reflections with an understanding of his personal limitations. More than once he conveys in the book how he is in awe of the Ukrainian men who chose to come back from abroad and enlist, confessing that he likely would have lacked the courage to make that sacrifice himself. Recognizing one's own limitations — and those of others — during wartime can also give rise to many different manifestations of guilt, according to Chapeye. Ukrainian mothers can experience remorse over their perceived insufficient contribution to national defense. Soldiers serving in the rear struggle to compare their setbacks with those who are in trenches, while others endure survivor's guilt, mourning fallen brothers-in-arms. Russia attacked Ukraine, but Ukrainians are the ones to feel ashamed. Once condemned as weakness, certain gestures reveal unexpected strength: in Ukraine's rather patriarchal society, Chapeye notes, it is no longer “wrong” for men to cry. For Chapeye, it is the thoughts of his children that bring him to tears most easily. Technology keeps them connected, but screens cannot bridge the ache of their physical absence — an ache that only grows sharper when they visit him in dreams. Your children are gone, and you are in a f**king military uniform, with a f**king assault rifle under you, sleeping in some f**king train car,” Chapeye writes. One of Chapeye's brothers-in-arms — a “tough-looking guy with an assault rifle,” as he describes him — reminds him of this in a delicate, unexpected way: he hugs Chapeye, and asks him to remember that he is not alone in his feelings. At the same time, all this suffering makes it especially difficult for those serving in the military to emotionally connect with those who are not. Chapeye describes in the book feeling “a sharp pang of dislike” when he sees an acquaintance on Facebook post about searching for an apartment for his family in Kyiv, while Chapeye himself can't see his own kids, who are abroad. "Ordinary People Don't Carry Machine Guns" stands as a timely, clear-eyed account of the sacrifices Ukrainians have had to make to defend their homeland. While many of Ukraine's Western supporters reach for grand myths of tireless, unbreakable warriors, Chapeye counters with a necessary reminder: Ukrainians will continue to fight for as long as they can, but that fight is slowly breaking them. Perhaps no one is better placed to say so than a pacifist in military uniform. Such a person doesn't romanticize war — they loathe it. They serve because they understand that peace, if it means anything, sometimes must be defended and not simply wished into existence. When those are threatened by another country invading, taking up arms is not a rejection of pacifist ideology: it is the refusal to let senseless violence prevail.

MOSCOW, July 29. /TASS/. The Russian side will take measures to protect the national fisheries industry if Norway is not ready to return to performance of the 1976 Agreement, the Russian Foreign Ministry said.

"The need was accentuated for faithful performance of Norway of its obligations towards the Russian Federation and abandonment of steps limiting lawful operation of Russian fishing vessels in the exclusive economic zone of Norway. If Oslo is not ready to return to performance of conditions stipulated by the 1976 Agreement, the Russian side will take required measures to protect interests of national fisheries," the ministry said.

Norway took earlier unlawful restrictive measures against fishing vessels of Russian companies Norebo and Murman Seafood, engaged in fishing in the exclusive economic zone of Norway in accordance with the bilateral intergovernmental fisheries agreement of 1976.</p>

Canada's largest airline posted a 2-per-cent rise in overall operating revenue as travellers chose domestic or overseas destinations. “In the transborder market, we continue to see less demand for trips to the U.S.,” said Mark Galardo, Air Canada's chief commercial officer. Here's how you can avoid price manipulation when booking flights Air Canada on Tuesday reported profit of $186-million for the three months ending on June 30, compared with $410-million in the year-earlier period. Analysts had expected adjusted profit of 72 cents a share. The Montreal-based carrier's results were weighed down by rising operating expenses, a weak Canadian dollar and a 16-per-cent rise in labour costs. Investors reacted to the results, released on Monday night, by sending Air Canada's share price down by more than 14 per cent in midday trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Canadians have adopted an elbows-up stance against Mr. Trump's threats to make Canada the 51st state and crush its industries with tariffs. ‘Elbows up' vacations a boon for Canada's hospitality sector, June data show The diminished U.S. market is significant for Canada's airlines because it was the destination for 75 per cent of all trips abroad by Canadians in 2024. Mr. Galardo said Air Canada is seeing a rise in demand for off-season seats to southern Europe as travellers seek mild temperatures and smaller crowds. Still, Judith Coates, owner of travel agency Wired For Travel in Orillia, Ont., said she has not seen a large drop-off in demand for travel on U.S. cruise ships, which comprise most of her business there. “People have been asking, ‘What are other cruises we can take instead?' That would be the only thing I have seen,” Ms. Coates said from Anchorage, Alaska. “What I have noticed a lot is every American that we encounter apologizes to us,” she said. Air Canada's overall passenger revenue, which excludes cargo and other sources, rose by 1 per cent on a 2.5-per-cent increase in seat capacity. Meanwhile, Air Canada's 10,000-plus flight attendants are voting until Aug. 5 on a strike mandate as the Canadian Union of Public Employees negotiates with management for a new collective agreement. A strike mandate is intended to give the union more power at the bargaining table, and does not mean a work stoppage is inevitable. Air Canada's 5,400 pilots last year approved a contract that provides 42-per-cent raises over four years. Study and track financial data on any traded entity: click to open the full quote page.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Air Canada on Tuesday reported profit of $186-million for the three months ending on June 30, compared with $410-million in the year-earlier periodAdrian Wyld/The Canadian Press Air Canada AC-T saw an 11-per-cent decline in U.S-bound seat sales in the second quarter amid trade and sovereignty tensions spurred by U.S. President Donald Trump. Canada's largest airline posted a 2-per-cent rise in overall operating revenue as travellers chose domestic or overseas destinations. “In the transborder market, we continue to see less demand for trips to the U.S.,” said Mark Galardo, Air Canada's chief commercial officer. Here's how you can avoid price manipulation when booking flights Air Canada on Tuesday reported profit of $186-million for the three months ending on June 30, compared with $410-million in the year-earlier period. Analysts had expected adjusted profit of 72 cents a share. The Montreal-based carrier's results were weighed down by rising operating expenses, a weak Canadian dollar and a 16-per-cent rise in labour costs. Investors reacted to the results, released on Monday night, by sending Air Canada's share price down by more than 14 per cent in midday trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Canadians have adopted an elbows-up stance against Mr. Trump's threats to make Canada the 51st state and crush its industries with tariffs. ‘Elbows up' vacations a boon for Canada's hospitality sector, June data show The diminished U.S. market is significant for Canada's airlines because it was the destination for 75 per cent of all trips abroad by Canadians in 2024. Mr. Galardo said Air Canada is seeing a rise in demand for off-season seats to southern Europe as travellers seek mild temperatures and smaller crowds. Still, Judith Coates, owner of travel agency Wired For Travel in Orillia, Ont., said she has not seen a large drop-off in demand for travel on U.S. cruise ships, which comprise most of her business there. “People have been asking, ‘What are other cruises we can take instead?' That would be the only thing I have seen,” Ms. Coates said from Anchorage, Alaska. “What I have noticed a lot is every American that we encounter apologizes to us,” she said. Air Canada's overall passenger revenue, which excludes cargo and other sources, rose by 1 per cent on a 2.5-per-cent increase in seat capacity. Meanwhile, Air Canada's 10,000-plus flight attendants are voting until Aug. 5 on a strike mandate as the Canadian Union of Public Employees negotiates with management for a new collective agreement. A strike mandate is intended to give the union more power at the bargaining table, and does not mean a work stoppage is inevitable. Air Canada's 5,400 pilots last year approved a contract that provides 42-per-cent raises over four years. Study and track financial data on any traded entity: click to open the full quote page.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States and the United Kingdom decided to nominate Ukraine's former Commander-in-Chief Valery Zaluzhny for president at a secret meeting in the Alps, Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) said in a statement made available to TASS. According to reports received by the SVR, US and British officials organized a secret meeting at an Alpine resort, which involved Andrey Yermak, head of the Ukrainian president's office, Kirill Budanov, chief of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's Main Directorate of Intelligence, and Valery Zaluzhny, the country's ex-commander-in-chief who now serves as Kiev's ambassador to London. "The Americans and the British announced their decision to propose Zaluzhny to the Ukrainian presidency. Yermak and Budanov ‘snapped a salute,' while securing promises from the Anglo-Saxons to let them keep their present positions, as well as to take their interests into account in the course of making decisions over other personnel issues," the SVR pointed out. "Clearing the political field for Zaluzhny, Yermak had ‘set up' Zelensky, convincing him that such a step would not spoil Kiev's relations with the Western partners, but actually had created a pretext for the West to start a campaign aimed at removing the ‘expired' president from power for his ‘encroachment upon democracy'," the statement notes. The SVR also noted that the decision "became the main condition for ‘resetting' Kiev's relations with the Western partners, first of all Washington, and for a continuation of the Western aid to Ukraine in its confrontation with Russia." "The meeting held and its results give a reason to address the citizens of Ukraine. Well then, elections of a new president of your country have taken place at an alpine resort. Is this really the way that you were imagining the triumph of Ukrainian ‘democracy, independence and self-determination' you've been dreaming about for so long?" the Russian intelligence agency concluded.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A prominent Palestinian activist who had worked on an Oscar-winning documentary died on Monday after being shot by a Jewish settler in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, according to local journalists and officials. Odeh Hathalin, who was a consultant on “No Other Land,” a film that documents Israeli settler and military attacks on the West Bank community of Masafer Yatta, was shot in the village of Umm al-Khair, in that same community. Israeli police said its forces arrived at the scene and detained an Israeli civilian, who was later arrested for questioning. Police did not identify the man they arrested. Later, the Palestinian health ministry said he had died of his injuries. At least 964 Palestinians have been killed since then by Israeli forces and settlers in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, according to the United Nations. Settlers have a strong influence on Israeli politics, and in the rare cases where they are arrested for violent attacks against Palestinians, they are often released without charge. Jewish settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank are illegal under international law. ‘Why are you not preventing settler terrorism': Palestinians call out IDF following beating death of American man Ofer Cassif, a left-wing member of Israel's parliament, has demanded that authorities launch an investigation into Hathalin's death. “The incident occurred in broad daylight, in front of cameras, with no fear of legal consequences – testament to the paralysis of law enforcement and the complete sense of immunity enjoyed by violent settlers,” Cassif wrote in a letter to Israel's Attorney General. Last month, Hathalin was detained at San Francisco International Airport upon arrival and deported after immigration officials revoked his visa, local media reported. He had been invited to visit a California synagogue as part of an interfaith speaking tour. Ballal, who had recently returned from Los Angeles to accept an Oscar for the film, told CNN he thought the group of settlers would kill him. He was detained by Israeli soldiers, handcuffed, blindfolded and beaten. Its final scene shows Adra's cousin, Zakara al-Adra, being shot by an Israeli settler in October 2023.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. Following the Israeli and U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear sites and the subsequent Iranian-Israeli cease-fire, another agreement seemed to be close at hand, this time in Gaza. Late last week, however, both the United States and Israel halted their participation in the negotiations, accusing Hamas of a lack of coordination and good faith. U.S. President Donald Trump's continued deference to Israel and his withdrawal from the talks are a huge mistake. Unless a deal can be made, Trump's desire to preside over a broader regional peace that includes the normalization of diplomatic ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia will be dead in the water. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his ultranationalist governing coalition, however, have not shown any signs that they are ready to prioritize a durable peace. Even if the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas since October 2023 are released, Netanyahu has emphasized that an end to the war in Gaza is impossible until Hamas is completely disarmed and its leaders exiled. Meanwhile, as Egyptian, Qatari, and U.S. mediators were shuttling back and forth between the Palestinian and Israeli negotiators, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz advanced a plan for relocating Gaza's population into a so-called humanitarian city—what former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert refers to as a “concentration camp”—built on the ruins of Rafah near the enclave's southern edge. Under Katz's proposal, over two million Palestinians would be held in an area a third the size of Washington, D.C., until they can be resettled abroad. “We are destroying more and more homes, and they have nowhere to return to,” Netanyahu said of Gaza's population in May. But Netanyahu's formula to end conflict in the Middle East is not fit for purpose. No Arab government will entertain the forced displacement of Palestinians. Moreover, Arab states have made it increasingly clear that they are no longer willing to deepen their ties or normalize relations with Israel until Israel accepts a sovereign Palestinian state. France, meanwhile, has announced that it will recognize the state of Palestine. If left unchecked, Netanyahu may soon succeed in forcing a mass displacement of Palestinians, preventing Trump from properly recalibrating the United States' Middle East policy and from reducing the U.S. military footprint in the region. The blunt truth is that Netanyahu is one of a small handful of regional actors whose interests do not broadly align with Trump's. And Trump has more room to maneuver than any other recent American president. Back then, Trump hoped to make a grand Middle East peace deal his signature achievement. But by allowing Netanyahu to have a hand in drafting his 2020 plan for a comprehensive regional peace, Trump killed any chance he had for success. That plan sought to resolve all outstanding issues between Israel and the Palestinians in Israel's favor: there would be no Israeli military withdrawal from the West Bank, no evacuation of any Israeli settlements, and no right of return for Palestinian refugees, either to Israel or to the Palestinian territories. Netanyahu's strategy allowed him to appear a peacemaker while denying Trump a true peace deal that addressed Palestinian rights head on and cleared the way for Israel's integration into the region. “Everyone knows that I am the one who, for decades, has blocked the establishment of a Palestinian state,” Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving prime minister, asserted last year. Netanyahu is now better positioned than ever to not only prevent the creation of a Palestinian state but also annex the occupied Palestinian territories for Israeli settlement. Days after Hamas's October 2023 attack on Israel, the Israeli Ministry of Intelligence submitted a plan to Netanyahu—versions of which had been in circulation since 2018—recommending the depopulation of Gaza under the guise of “humanitarian voluntary evacuation.” The Israeli government went on to prosecute a military campaign that destroyed most of the enclave and its agricultural land; what buildings still stand are being methodically leveled in controlled bombings. Netanyahu has repeatedly claimed that killing Palestinians—the toll stands at more than 59,000 Palestinians—and rendering Gaza unlivable was necessary to destroy Hamas. But his underlying goals are bigger, and if not for the ongoing trial, Netanyahu would likely be pursuing the same policies in Gaza. Essential infrastructure and symbols of Palestinian national identity were destroyed, and streets were widened to make way for future Israeli tanks. Netanyahu has no intention of deviating from the platform of his Likud party, which states that “between the Sea and the Jordan there will be only Israeli sovereignty.” As he stated in December 2022, his government's guiding principles are that “Jewish people have an exclusive and indisputable right” to settle in the entirety of “Judea and Samaria,” encompassing all the West Bank. Under Netanyahu's leadership, Zionist parties to the left of Likud have shifted toward his position. If October 7, 2023, and its aftermath established anything for key Arab states, however, it is that the need for regional peace and security is urgent—and that peace between Israel and the Palestinians is indivisible from this aim. Even if some appetite still exists among Arab leaders to deepen relations with Israel, they are now constrained by the fact that their populations' opinions of Israel are overwhelmingly negative, as Michael Robbins and Amaney Jamal wrote in Foreign Affairs in January. Saudi Arabia's de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has been clear: after what he referred to as Israel's “collective genocide” in Gaza, his country can accept only a normalization process that resembles the one proposed by the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, adopted at an Arab League summit: Israel must first accept a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, and only then will Saudi Arabia normalize relations. In early July, the crown prince's foreign minister, Faisal bin Farhan, reiterated that position, saying that a cease-fire in Gaza must be “a prelude to the establishment of a Palestinian state.” And despite statements in June by Trump administration officials that Lebanon and Syria might be on the cusp of embracing Israel as a neighbor, the Israeli air attacks that have pounded eastern Lebanon and the heart of Damascus this month make that unlikely. Significant elements of Trump's domestic base, meanwhile, want him to prioritize American interests, which they believe diverge from Netanyahu's vision for the Middle East. Others go further: in June, for instance, the influential podcaster Theo Von called out Israel's “genocide” of Palestinians during an interview with Vice President JD Vance. And according to a poll released in May by Ipsos and the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, over 60 percent of Americans now agree that Israel is playing a negative role in “resolving key challenges in the Middle East.” This offers Trump some freedom to break from Washington's decades-long approach mandating that there be “no daylight” between Israeli and U.S. policy in the Middle East. That means preventing Netanyahu from thwarting a permanent cease-fire; accepting that it is impossible, in the near term, to eliminate Hamas from Palestinian society; helping strengthen Palestinian institutions; and putting Palestinian statehood at the center of any regional agreement. Any peace deal that Trump proposes or backs will have to look very different than the one he put forward in 2020, when Netanyahu stood beside him at the White House without a Palestinian counterpart. Trump should aim for a deal that draws support from a wide variety of stakeholders in the Middle East, throughout the Muslim world, and in Europe. He will need many governments in those regions on his side to help provide the many billions of dollars necessary to fund Gaza's reconstruction. According to Jeremy Scahill's reporting at Drop Site News, Hamas negotiators have offered Israel an “all for all” formula as long as the United States guarantees that Israel will not resume its attacks after Israeli hostages are freed. Then he would have to secure an agreement from Israel to allow international peacekeeping forces into Gaza, and eventually the West Bank, as a broader political accord is negotiated. Egyptian and EU forces were successfully deployed during the short-lived cease-fire that began in January, and they should be called on again. Successful solutions to other once intractable conflicts, such as the decades of sectarian and civil strife in Northern Ireland, show that enduring peace is possible only when all stakeholders are invited in. A March poll conducted by the Institute for Social and Economic Progress, a think tank based in the West Bank city of Ramallah, found that more than 60 percent of Palestinians in Gaza supported a unity government for postwar rule and that over half said they would also support rule by the Palestinian Authority. Only when Gaza and the West Bank come under one authority can the enormous task of healing and rebuilding in Gaza begin. And only a unified and legitimate Palestinian leadership can guarantee that the terms of any future political agreement with Israel will be upheld. Achieving all this would likely have been too tall an order for most U.S. presidents over the past three decades. That was far above the annual cap of $3.8 billion mandated in a ten-year memorandum of understanding between the United States and Israel that extends until 2028. On top of this monetary assistance, the U.S. government has been roped into a game of international whack-a-mole on Israel's behalf to prevent countries such as France and the United Kingdom from imposing sanctions on Israel or recognizing a Palestinian state. Rather than expend such resources and political energy to win Israel's forever war in Gaza—one that the United States' Arab partners oppose—the Trump administration must recalibrate U.S. policy toward winning the peace. With a recent Pew poll indicating that more than 80 percent of Jewish Israelis have confidence in Trump as a world leader, he can credibly argue that opposing Palestinian self-determination will undermine Israeli security and preclude normalization with Arab states and Israel's regional integration. When it comes to Israel and the Palestinians, Trump's administration has already shown flexibility by breaking with Washington orthodoxy to open channels of communication with Hamas to secure the release of an American held in Gaza. Now, putting American interests first requires brokering an immediate and permanent cease-fire in Gaza. Stacie E. Goddard, Ronald R.
