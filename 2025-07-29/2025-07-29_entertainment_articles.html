                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Longtime HGTV star Ben Napier is finally getting some relief years after first injuring his ankle, which his wife and “Home Town” co-star Erin Napier says has since been “eaten up with arthritis.” The couple and their kids — daughters Helen, 7, and Mae, 4 — just returned from a summer 2025 trip to Scotland, where she said hiking was particularly “rough” for Ben. his ortho doc says he needs an ankle replacement it's so eaten up with arthritis now, but my big brother and this magic machine at @optimal_performance_pt has taken his pain from a 12 to a 4. StemWave is a relatively new non-invasive modality, according to the StemWave website, featuring an “electrohydraulic system that sends focused waves to activate connective tissue, relieve minor aches and pains and temporarily increase localized blood circulation.” When one of Erin's followers asked how Ben handled hiking in Scotland, she replied, “9 mile hike was ROUGH on that ankle. Replying to another fan curious about Ben's treatments, Erin wrote, “his treatment plan is twice a week for 6 weeks” Ben shared Erin's post in his Instagram Stories on July 29 and wrote, “It is amazing. This is not the first time Ben has seen his brother-in-law for physical therapy. In January 2023, Rasberry helped Ben with ongoing shoulder pain that had been bothering him for years. Ben did have rotator cuff surgery that spring, but was able to prepare for it and heal well afterwards with physical therapy. She wrote at the time that Rasberry “was brave enough to step out in faith and left the hospital where our dad retired from to became a partner in a physical therapy clinic last year.” “The way my brother knows what exercises can heal an injury is like a kind of magic. I've always loved that the men in mine know how to heal people with their hands.” With two decades of experience, Erin's brother joined Optimal Performance Physical Therapy in December 2021, according to the clinic's Instagram account.</p>

At the time of her exit, she told Deadline, “I love this group of people, everybody from cast and crew, producers, everybody. This was a really hard decision to make.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Four staffers were also let go at Warner Music Nashville amid a $300 million cost-cutting effort at parent Warner Music Group. In a realignment of its marketing department, Warner Records has combined the digital and traditional marketing teams, resulting in several promotions and at least three staffers being let go. Staff cuts will account for $170 million of the planned reductions. Warner Records' revamped marketing team will now be run by Dalia Ganz, who has been promoted to executive vp/head of digital & marketing and will report to Warner Records GM Mike Chester. Three executives have also been raised from vps to senior vps of marketing strategy and operations:  Jesse Ervin, TJ Landig and Shawnae Corbett-Rice. The commerce team has also been restructured and will be led by Axel Hyge, senior vp of streaming strategy, and Dave Edwards, senior vp of revenue & operations. “This is a reimagining of how we can best market and develop exceptional talent. It's designed for speed, intelligence, collaboration, and top flight service to our incredible roster,” Chester said in the July 1 memo. “Dalia is a future forward executive whose digital marketing expertise has been pivotal to our recent success. Together with their entire teams, I have no doubt they'll do a phenomenal, industry-leading job for our artists as we continue to build groundbreaking careers in a rapidly expanding musical universe.” A Warner Music Nashville representative confirmed the cuts and added in a statement, “As we continue to deepen our commitment to original artists, we're working with Warner Records and our global network to create faster, more impactful opportunities for Nashville talent. As part of this evolution, we're forming two supercharged radio promotion teams to deliver even greater results for our artists. Today, we made the difficult decision to say goodbye to four colleagues who all leave with our deep gratitude and best wishes for their next chapters.” In his July 1 memo, Kyncl indicated that the money freed up through these cuts will be reinvested in A&R and M&A. Also on July 1, WMG announced the launch of its $1.2 billion catalog acquisition venture with Bain Capital. A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

James Cameron is at the point in his legendary career that he is not making decisions on box office returns but rather, just what feels “fun” to do. The auteur already explained why he thinks his “Ghosts of Hiroshima” adaptation will be his lowest grossing film ever (the epic will be made more out of moral obligation than for financial reasons), and has his third “Avatar” film, titled “Avatar: Fire And Ash,” set for a December 2025 theatrical release. Oh, and a Billie Eilish 3D concert film might be on the way… It's only right that Cameron, too, gets to unwind with a lighter passion project here and there, and the director told Empire that his soon-to-be adaptation of the fantasy novel “The Devils” will be just that.

The project will be a different kind of undertaking for Cameron, too: “It doesn't have the kind of conscience that ‘Avatar' does, but I don't know if that's a bad thing. ‘The Devils' is a movie you do for fun,” he said. “'The Devils' showcases [author] Joe's jaundiced view of human nature, in all its dark, selfish glory, as told through some decidedly un-human characters,” Cameron said. “But of course, Joe always teases with the flickers of redemption that make it all worthwhile — and ultimately quite heart-wrenching. I've loved Joe's writing for years, cherishing each new read, throughout the epic cycle of the ‘First Law' books, especially ‘Best Served Cold' (LOVE IT!) I'm looking forward to the writing process with him, though I'm certain this adaptation will practically write itself because Joe writes very visually, almost in scenes, and with a very cinematic structure.

That's what Adobe does every year as the sponsor of the Young Lions competitions at the annual Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity that takes place each June. Now celebrating its 30th anniversary, Young Lions brought together nearly 460 emerging professionals this year from 67 markets worldwide for their Design, Digital, Film, Media, Marketers, PR, and Print competitions. While on the Croisette they form new connections, learn from industry icons and thought leaders, and develop a community that they can bring with them into their future careers. Related Stories Alison Brie and Dave Franco Make Their Own Horror Version of ‘Eyes Wide Shut' with ‘Together' ‘Blue Moon' Trailer: Ethan Hawke Puts on a Bald Cap and a Great Performance as Boozy Songwriter Lorenz Hart Stacy Martinet, VP, Marketing & Chief Communications Officer of Adobe said, “Young Lions is the best part of Cannes Lions. Gold, Silver, and Bronze awards are given out to the winners in each category, and for the first time ever Turkey won Gold in the Marketers competition, while Guatemala won its first prize overall, taking Gold in Film. “Adobe's partnership with Young Lions is so incredible,” Martinet said. Just seeing how these creatives are thinking, working, what motivates them. Each of the competitors in all of the categories use Adobe tools such as Firefly, Adobe Stock, and Express to bring their ideas to life. A panel of professional judges awards the prizes, and each category is partnered with an external brand to create a unique activation for that brand in the respective discipline: Ovarian Cancer Action asked the film competitors to create a powerful, uplifting 60-second film for World Ovarian Cancer Day, and asked the media competitors about how to better engage their audience to inspire positive change; the Museum of Art & Photography India challenged Young Lions in the Design section to create visual storytelling that illustrates how comic storytelling is more than a Western, child-centric medium. Pakistan's Pazirish Zehra Mirza, shortlisted in the 2025 Marketers category said she most appreciates Young Lions for its “bold ideas. The kind of ideas that we wouldn't do in normal, real life. Over here, you can just think really big. Alums of the program can't sing its praises enough. Cannes Lions' CEO, Simon Cook said, “The many hundreds and thousands of people that have been through that program have fed back to us every year just how important it is to have that access to industry legends, who give them the tools they need to propel their careers forward.” We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For another, there's that Fantastic Four rocket emerging from space at the end of Thunderbolts*. Those who know their comics lore have probably already clocked that there's another, bigger connection to the wider Marvel picture, one contained in a very small package. He's still in diapers, but depending on how messy this new MCU gets, Franklin Richards might end up as its single most important character. First off, yes, there's a baby that can resurrect the dead in the MCU now, and if you think that's going to complicate these stories a great deal in the years to come, you are likely correct. The son of Reed Richard (Pedro Pascal) and Sue Storm (Vanessa Kirby), Franklin Richards (Ada Scott) has been a part of the Marvel Comics world for nearly 60 years, first appearing in 1968 in the pages of Fantastic Four Annual #6, created by Marvel Comics' founding fathers Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. As in First Steps, his expectant parents worried that Franklin's DNA might be affected by the same cosmic radiation that gave them their powers, and as in The Fantastic Four: First Steps, Franklin started to exhibit extraordinary abilities even as a baby. For much of the 1970s, '80s, and '90s, Franklin's superpowers, though enormous, were often treated as something of a sideshow by the larger Marvel Universe. It was a real “Jack-Jack in The Incredibles” situation. That changed in a very pronounced way in 2009, when writer Jonathan Hickman took over story duties on the ongoing Fantastic Four comic book series. This massive macro-story touched on every aspect of Fantastic Four and Marvel Comics lore, and among many other things, it redefined Franklin's place in the multiverse. Though he was always seen as a powerful child prodigy, Franklin became even more important under Hickman, who devised a cross-time story in which an older Franklin from the future returned to the present to help his child self refine and strengthen his powers. And, as his resurrection powers in First Steps suggest, Franklin's got a lot of potential. He's initially classified as a mutant, and eventually his powers are assessed as so great that calling him “Omega-level,” like Magneto and Apocalypse, doesn't really begin to cover it. During the Hickman era, Franklin practices his matter-altering powers to such an extent that he's able to create pocket universes and draw the eye of Galactus, who sees Franklin as his heir. He's literally the last man standing from a whole multiverse, and Hickman's Fantastic Four reveals that Franklin is destined to succeed him as the survivor of the current multiverse when it finally goes boom. During Hickman's Secret Wars, the basis for the upcoming Avengers film following Doomsday, Franklin, his sister Valeria (who has powers of her own), and his mother are taken by Doctor Doom, the new God-Emperor of what's left of the cosmos, and adopted as his own family. Doom rules over Battleworld, a hodgepodge of all the surviving Marvel multiverse characters and worlds. No one has any memory of what came before, until a group of surviving superheroes (including Reed Richards) begins to reveal the truth. In a final battle, Doom is defeated, and Reed sets out to rebuild the Marvel multiverse world by world, universe by universe. And he does this, in part, through Franklin's ability to generate entire universes, whole cloth. Is this exactly what will happen in the MCU? It's early days for the character, but keep a close eye on Franklin Richards.

Chalamet's appointment as Lucid's Global Brand Ambassador was accompanied by a series of teaser images promoting his upcoming campaign for the Lucid Gravity, the automaker's all-electric SUV that first rolled off production lines last fall. The new photos see Chalamet posing with a 2026 Lucid Gravity Grand Touring in an “Aurora Green” finish, against a stark desert backdrop that harks back to the actor's performances in Dune (the two-time Oscar nominee is currently filming Dune: Part Three, directed by Denis Villeneuve). Dressed in a leather biker jacket over a simple white T-shirt and black pants, Chalamet channels an approachable luxury vibe that compliments Lucid's brand ethos — the company bills itself as a car marker that merges “best-in-class performance [and] sophisticated design with unrivaled energy efficiency. Unlike many young Hollywood stars, Chalamet doesn't often appear in brand campaigns and this is his first partnership in the automotive space. The new Lucid role does appear to be an organic fit: the actor was first spotted driving a Lucid Air in 2023 while tailing girlfriend Kylie Jenner out of his Beverly Hills house. He's since been spotted multiple times out and about in his EV. “We're excited to welcome Timothée as our first Global Brand Ambassador,” says Akerho “AK” Oghoghomeh, Senior Vice President of Marketing at Lucid Motors. “He brings together the same fearless creativity and uncompromising vision that defines our brand, embodying what it means to compromise nothing, both on and off screen. Lucid's full campaign starring Chalamet will debut later this year. The car maker's parent company, Atieva, was founded in 2007, with a focus on battery technology, but it was rebranded as Lucid in 2016. Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Awdah Hathaleen, a Palestinian activist and journalist who contributed to the Oscar-winning 2024 documentary No Other Land, was killed Monday in an attack by Israeli settlers. Captured footage of the attack appears to show Israeli settler Yinon Levi, who had previously been put under sanctions by Joe Biden before they were removed by Donald Trump, firing his gun indiscriminately during the attack. He was later arrested by Israeli police for questioning, though no charges were filed against him, The Guardian reports. Other residents responded by throwing stones, during which Levi allegedly entered the fray and began shooting. My dear friend Awdah was slaughtered this evening,” Basel Adra, No Other Land‘s Palestinian co-director, shared on social media. This is how Israel erases us — one life at a time.” Adra also shared footage of the attack, reiterating that Levi is currently “sanctioned by 9 countries (now 8, because of Trump).” Yuval Abraham, the documentary's Israeli co-director, also shared the video, calling Hathaleen “a remarkable activist.” Last month, Hathaleen and his cousin Eid al-Hathaleen attempted to fly to the U.S. for a series of planned talks but had their entry denied and their visas revoked at the San Francisco International Airport. He had come to raise summer camp funds to help give Palestinian children experiencing the unthinkable a semblance  of a childhood back home,” San Francisco supervisor Bilal Mahmood, who previously protested the visa revocation, wrote in a statement on X on Monday. This is an absolute tragedy, and must be condemned. All the children run to their mothers, who scramble to salvage whatever they can from their homes before it's too late. Everyone watches on anxiously to see who will be made homeless today. Our children ask us why this is happening, but we have no answers,” he wrote. “Amid all of this injustice, we often feel forgotten, lost, or hopeless. Sometimes we wonder: why do Israelis see us as terrorists and enemies? Why is the world not acting to achieve justice for Palestinians? But now we are stuck here; there's no way to leave.” Lena Dunham's Too Much is just right By Juan Barquin July 10, 2025 | 11:00am Chrishell Stause and G Flip Get Married Again in Medieval-Themed Wedding PASTEThe Sandman Showrunner Breaks Down Dream's  Season 2 Journey and Bringing the Comic Saga's Epic End to Life ENDLESS MODENintendo Has Unexpectedly Turned Its Damsels in Distress into Icons for Young Girls</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mary J. Blige is firing back at a lawsuit filed by her former stylist Misa Hylton, accusing the longtime friend and her lawyers of “fabricating accusations” to try to win a settlement payout. In her first response to the lawsuit on Monday, lawyers for Blige didn't hold back – arguing that Hylton's allegations were not only “baseless” but also entirely fictional. “Plaintiffs and their counsel appear to enjoy fabricating accusations that will be discussed in the press and on social media for the purposes of harassing defendants and trying to coerce a favorable settlement,” writes Blige, represented by veteran music litigator Lisa F. Moore. “Plaintiffs and their counsel had significant time to investigate these issues, not only before filing but also after defendants' counsel sent a lengthy letter identifying with granular specificity why each of their claims is baseless,” Blige's lawyers write. Hylton is a longtime hip-hop stylist known for dressing Blige, Lil Kim, Missy Elliott, Aaliyah and many other stars in the 1990s and 2000s – including Kim's legendary breast-exposed purple jumpsuit at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards. The case claims that Blige exerted pressure on Vado (Teyon Winfree), who was signed to the star's Beautiful Life Records, to fire Hylton as his manager. The lawsuit, which Vado co-filed alongside Hylton, claims Blige is refusing to release an already-finished album or allow him to tour until he ditches Hylton. “Defendants are intentionally ‘drying out' plaintiff Winfree – exercising provisions in the [record contract] to intentionally withhold his music from the market and bar him from performing live and touring – in order to compel him to terminate his the talent contract with [Hylton and her company].” But in her first response on Monday, Blige's lawyers say the case is so flawed that Hylton and her lawyer must be punished for bringing it. They say the alleged contract between Hylton's firm and Vado is void because her company doesn't even legally exist; they also say that it was Vado himself who failed to meet the requirements of his record deal with Beautiful Life. The new response also reveals a scathing letter that Blige's attorneys sent to Hylton and Vado's lawyer shortly after the case was first filed in May. “It is obvious that the complaint was filed by you and plaintiffs for the sole purpose of harassing and causing malicious injury to [Beautiful Life] and Ms. Blige based on Hylton's personal animus towards Ms. Blige,” they wrote in the letter, before later ending it ominously: “Your next step in handling this matter shall govern ours.” The letter also includes more details on the dispute, including a screencap in which Vado himself purportedly suggested that he might fire Hylton on his own initiative. “Between me and u I might be firing Misa,” the alleged text reads. The star's attorneys say it shows that the plaintiffs were aware of the flaws in their case but chose to continue pursuing it, forcing Blige to “expend time and resources making this motion to dismiss their patently frivolous claims.” The filing did not specify an amount of sanctions that Blige is seeking.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last month, Animal Collective digitally released “Love on the Big Screen,” and they've now shared its B-Side. Today's new song, “Buddies on the Blackboard,” is a psychedelic daydream set to a dub beat. Listen to it below. “Love on the Big Screen” and “Buddies on the Blackboard” will be released together on a 7" vinyl single that's out on August 1 via Domino. Both tracks were produced by Avey Tare and Drop of Sun Studios founder Adam McDaniel. They were also mixed and engineered by McDaniel, while the mastering was done by Dave Cooley. Animal Collective's most recent studio album, Isn't It Now?, came out in 2023, while the band's Panda Bear put out his own solo LP, Sinister Grift, this past March. All rights reserved.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nashville egg-punks Snõõper have announced a new album. Worldwide is out on October 3 via Third Man, marking their second full-length for the label. Snõõper are sharing the title track from the LP today along with a music video, too, and you can watch below. In Snõõper's eyes, Worldwide feels more like their true debut album because 2023's Super Snõõper was a re-recorded collection of their pre-existing material. In the years since Snõõper released Super Snõõper on Third Man, they've also put out a few singles, a split with Prison Affair in 2024, and the Unknown Caller EP earlier this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But she's not at home; the bedroom is a replica. Abrams is actually sitting dead-center at New York's Madison Square Garden during the first of two sold-out shows. The bedroom Abrams has replicated is the same one where, as an upstart singer-songwriter five years ago, she first performed her 2020 Minor EP during pandemic-era shows she livestreamed over Zoom. With each earnest lyric and low-key performance since, Abrams gradually captured the hearts of Gen Z women around the world. By the time she released her 2023 debut album, Good Riddance, the star had already nabbed opening-act slots for Olivia Rodrigo and Taylor Swift. “It feels like the most ridiculous master class known to man,” Abrams told Rolling Stone before opening for Swift's Eras Tour. The Eras Tour saw Abrams transform from a breathy, understated vocalist into an acoustic-guitar-wielding goddess with a slew of emotion-packed songs. Last year, Abrams embarked on her largest headlining tour yet, selling out three nights at New York's Radio City Music Hall. Now, for her current tour, Abrams has leveled up to sold-out arenas. She kept smirking, even as she delivered lines like “I feel like I could die” (from “Risk”) and concurrently strummed an acoustic guitar. But the main thing you have to know about a Gracie Abrams concert is there are no wardrobe changes, outsized production sets, or buttoned-up choreography. Instead, there are hundreds of bow-wearing fans willing to push the limits of their vocal chords as they scream each lyric like their life depends on it. I'm not talking about just for the set list closers, either. (At one point, girls in the row behind me complained about losing their voices before Abrams could even whip out her most popular tunes.) This isn't just for the hell of it, either. On “21,” fans squealed “sorry” in unison as Abrams reached high into her register. Nowhere was the deep-rooted fan connection with Abrams' brutally honest catalog more apparent than on “Let It Happen,” a Swiftian track with an explosive bridge. When it got to that point in the song, the singer urged the already-wailing fans: “I want to hear this bridge, all right?” They obeyed her like good pupils and didn't fumble a single lyric. Fans even knew every word to the unreleased synth-pop track “Out of Nowhere,” which Abrams debuted at her Glastonbury set just last month. While singing “Tough Love,” Abrams spotted a fan's poster that read “Write out ‘Let It Happen. Role Model and Laufey Fall Out of Love in ‘The Longest Goodbye' Video Role Model Drops Out of Several Gracie Abrams Shows to Film Netflix's 'Good Sex' Just before launching into TSOU Deluxe track “Cool,” Abrams asked, “This is a safe space to say it … is anyone in a situationship of sorts?” Not only did the audience respond emphatically, they sang about love interests not calling back with a palpable anger. (It was the most excited I'd ever seen a Garden crowd for an opener.) For his solo set, Pillsbury turned the charm offensive all the way up, shimmying his hips as he sang twangy love songs. The highlight, of course, was his celebrity guest for crowd-favorite “Sally, When the Wine Runs Out,” which was none other than Natalie Portman. While Abrams' viral TikTok hits like “That's So True” and “Close to You” got their massive, end-of-the-night moments, they weren't even the biggest of the evening. Sure it was a treat to hear several audience members try to conjure a surprise Taylor Swift appearance with their whispers. As the singer delivered lyrics about reflecting on her success, video clips of fans from her past shows played on the screen. “I feel like myself right now,” Abrams sang, and the line hit so hard, several fans had tears streaming down their faces. After all, these devoted attendees know better than anyone that the singer-songwriter has trekked through New York clubs for the past four years, growing her audience with each performance. “Now, because of you, we get to be here for two sold-out nights. I just want you to know that all of us were backstage pinching ourselves and each other.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cirie Fields has dropped the biggest hint yet that her incredible “Survivor” journey may be coming to an end. The 55-year-old reality TV mastermind, who transformed from self-described “couch potato” to beloved strategist, recently suggested that the upcoming milestone season could mark her final competitive appearance on the iconic show. During a candid interview with Entertainment Weekly, Fields addressed the possibility of stepping away from the game that made her a household name. When asked about her future plans after filming both “Australian Survivor: Australia v The World” and the highly anticipated “Survivor 50,” her response was telling. I'll go and do a guest spot if they want me to come and teach some of these young'uns how to play,” Fields said. I don't know if Jeff needs a nurse on set, maybe. The former nurse's comments suggest a shift from active competition to a mentorship role, though she hasn't completely closed the door on future appearances. But I feel like 50 was my swan song,” she revealed during the interview. She offered a colorful analogy to describe the physical challenges of competing at her current age compared to her debut season. “Playing Survivor in your fifties is like driving a car that you had 20 years ago,” she explained. The comparison continues with typical Cirie humor: “Then, after about 10 years or so, you might need to change a fuel pump or catalytic converter. Fields acknowledged that age brings constant reminders during gameplay. Despite the physical challenges, Fields maintains her signature approach to preparation, or lack thereof. “I clearly didn't do anything with my working out. And I'm not sorry for that either!” she laughed. Fields' potential retirement comes after a remarkable run across multiple reality franchises. According to Us Weekly, she's widely considered “the greatest reality TV competitor of all time” by fans who have followed her 17-year career spanning different television shows. Her journey began in 2006 on “Survivor: Panama” when she famously got up off the couch to try reality television. She would go on to play “Survivor” four more times. She competed in the following seasons: “Micronesia,” “Heroes vs. Villains,” “Game Changers,” and the upcoming 50th season, “In the Hands of the Fans.” Jeff Probst has praised her unique abilities, noting her exceptional social skills that allow others to help her even when they know she might eliminate them. Fields has now also appeared on “Australian Survivor” alongside American legends Parvati Shallow and Tony Vlachos, and the upcoming “Survivor 50” promises to be another memorable chapter. Whether it truly represents her final competitive bow is still uncertain, but her comments suggest she's ready to pass the torch to the next generation of players.</p>
