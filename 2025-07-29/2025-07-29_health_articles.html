                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a major step towards early detection, University of South Australia researchers are investigating the biology behind multiple sclerosis (MS) to help predict people's genetic risk of developing the disease, long before any symptoms appear. Funded by an MS Australia Incubator Grant announced today, the Australian-first study will use a powerful new research method known as 'recall by genotype' to explore genetic causes of MS. Specifically, the study will explore links between MS and the Epstein-Barr virus – a common virus best known for causing glandular fever, but increasingly believed to be a trigger for MS. MS is a chronic autoimmune disease that disrupts communication between the brain, spinal cord and body. Affecting more than 33,000 Australians, the exact cause of MS remains unknown, though genetics and environmental factors are thought to play a key role. Lead researcher, UniSA's Dr. David Stacey, says the research aims to untangle how the Epstein-Barr virus might lead to MS in some people but not others. "We believe the way a person's immune system responds to the Epstein-Barr virus may be a key factor, and genetics can help us uncover that." The study will calculate MS genetic risk scores for more than 1000 South Australian participants without an MS diagnosis, then compare biological traits in a subset of participants with either high or low genetic risk. By grouping people based on their genetic profile, we expect to find those with a high genetic risk for MS will also show biological differences – even if they don't have the disease. To enable this study, the researchers will use an innovative research design called 'recall by genotype' – or RbG for short. RbG studies use naturally occurring genetic variants that are strongly associated with a disease to group people for research. Participants are then 'recalled' for further testing based on their DNA, allowing researchers to study differences in a more targeted and reliable way. This study will therefore help to establish standard operating procedures for participant recall and tackle important ethical questions about sharing genetic risk with research participants. "If we identify people who are at risk of developing MS, we need to consider how – and whether – to share that information, particularly as this information may not yet be clinically actionable," Dr Stacey says. "This study will explore those ethical, legal and social questions to guide how future studies approach personal genetic risk."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A personalized brain stimulation system powered by artificial intelligence (AI) that can safely enhance concentration from home has been developed by researchers from the University of Surrey, the University of Oxford and Cognitive Neurotechnology. Designed to adapt to individual characteristics, the system could help people improve focus during study, work, or other mentally demanding tasks. Published in npj Digital Medicine, the study is based on a patented approach that uses non-invasive brain stimulation alongside adaptive AI to maximize its impact. The technology uses transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) – a gentle and painless form of electrical brain stimulation – and an AI algorithm that learns to personalise stimulation based on individual features, including attention level and head size. The AI was trained using data from 103 people aged 18 to 35, who completed 290 home-based sessions using CE-marked (European Union standard) headgear and a tablet-based sustained attention task. The system was then evaluated in a double-blind study involving 37 new participants. The strongest improvements were seen in individuals who initially showed lower levels of attention. What is exciting about this work is that we have shown it is possible to safely and effectively enhance cognitive performance using a personalised system that people can use independently at home. This opens new possibilities for improving sustained attention, learning, and other cognitive abilities in a way that is accessible, adaptive, and scalable. Our work highlights the growing role of AI and wearable neurotechnology in enabling personalized, real-world cognitive enhancement, with potential applications across education, training, and future clinical use." The study found no serious side effects and the frequency and severity of sensations during stimulation were no different from those experienced during placebo. The AI also helped avoid stimulation levels that could impair performance – something previous non-personalized methods could not achieve. Cohen Kadosh, R., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study published in the American Journal of Health Promotion finds that inadequate leisure-time aerobic physical activity accounts for $192 billion in annual healthcare costs among U.S. adults-12.6% of total national health care spending. Researchers analyzed data from more than 76,000 adults between 2012 and 2019. "Aerobic physical activity is an investment in health-it strengthens the heart, reduces chronic disease burdens, and empowers us to live with energy and freedom," said one of the study's co-authors, Dr. Adam Chen, of the University of Georgia's College of Public Health. Despite modest national gains in physical activity, health care costs continue to rise, largely driven by preventable chronic conditions. The consequences are being felt across sectors. "These findings provide further economic reasons for health systems, payers, and clinicians to integrate physical activity assessment, prescription, and referral into health care delivery," said co-author Laurie Whitsel, PhD, National Vice President of Policy Research at the American Heart Association and Senior Advisor to the national Physical Activity Alliance. "We need to inspire and support people to make physical activity a regular part of their day." "Every step counts toward a healthier future."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Background and goal: Although body mass index (BMI) is widely used in clinics as the standard measure of body composition, it can potentially misclassify muscular individuals as overweight and miss cases of "normal-weight obesity," masking serious metabolic and heart disease risks. This study examined BMI vs body fat percentage for 15-year mortality risk among adults aged 20-49 years. Study approach: Researchers from the University of Florida analyzed data from 4,252 participants in the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized U.S. adults ages 20 to 49. All participants had complete technician measured body composition data, including height, weight and waist circumference. Body-fat percentage was assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Records were linked to the National Death Index through 2019. Adults with a high body-fat percentage (27% or more in men; 44% or more in women) were 1.78 times more likely to die from any cause than individuals in the healthy body fat range (HR 1.78; 95% CI, 1.28 to 2.47). Adults with a high body-fat percentage were also 3.62 times more likely to die from heart disease (HR 3.62; 95% CI, 1.55 to 8.45). Overweight/obese BMI (25 kg/m² or higher) was not associated with a statistically significant higher risk of death from any cause, compared with adults in the healthy BMI range (HR 1.25, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.84). Adults with a high waist circumference (more than 40 inches in men; more than 35 inches in women) were 1.59 times more likely to die from any cause than individuals in the healthy range (HR 1.59; 95% CI, 1.12 to 2.26). Adults with a high waist circumference were also 4.01 times more likely to die from heart disease (HR 4.01; 95% CI, 1.94 to 8.27). Why it matters: The study findings support reexamining how body composition is measured in clinical settings. Historically, it has been difficult to measure body fat percentage in primary care outpatient settings. New bioelectrical impedance devices have the potential to change this.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research from scientists at the Marshall University Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine reveals that certain gut microbial byproducts may hold promise as a novel therapy for obesity-associated metabolic complications by restoring critical hormone-producing cells in the intestine. The study, published this month in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, focuses on enteroendocrine cells (EECs)-specialized cells in the gut that play a key role in metabolic regulation by releasing hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which stimulate insulin secretion and suppress appetite. In obesity, these cells are diminished in number and function, contributing to insulin resistance and poor metabolic health. Researchers investigated how microbial metabolites derived from dietary tryptophan-an amino acid found in protein-rich foods-may help restore EEC numbers. Specifically, they studied the effects of indole, a key tryptophan metabolite produced by gut bacteria, on intestinal stem cell differentiation into EECs. Using a combination of human intestinal organoids, known as "mini-gut", and rat models, the research team discovered that obesity led to a significant drop-about 60%-in the number of hormone-producing cells in the intestines. However, when human gut organoids were treated with indole or with the culture medium of a probiotic bacterial strain grown in tryptophan, the number of these cells more than doubled. This effect was blocked when a specific cell receptor called the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) was turned off, suggesting this pathway plays a key role in the process. Our findings suggest that microbial metabolites derived from dietary tryptophan can reverse obesity-associated reductions in hormone-secreting gut cells. Alip Borthakur, Ph.D., assistant professor of biomedical sciences at the Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine and principal investigator and corresponding author on the study The study provides foundational evidence supporting the development of microbiota-targeted interventions-such as probiotic or dietary approaches-to boost incretin hormone production to improve glucose metabolism and regulate appetite in people with obesity. In addition to Borthakur, the study's co-authors include: undergraduate student Morrison Chicko, graduate students James Hart and Hassan Mansour, doctoral student Harshal Sawant and faculty members Subha Arthur, Ph.D., and Jennifer Haynes, Ph.D. "It has been exciting to mentor four enthusiastic, intelligent, curious and dedicated Marshall students at different times of the study," Borthakur said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for over 80% of lung cancer cases and is often diagnosed at advanced stages, limiting treatment options. While genetic and epigenetic alterations are known contributors to its pathogenesis, DNA methylation-based biomarkers are increasingly recognized for their potential in early detection and prognosis. The NF-κB signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in cancer proliferation and immune evasion. Despite its clinical relevance, few upstream regulators of this pathway have been clearly defined in NSCLC. Based on these challenges, in-depth research is needed to uncover new molecular targets that drive NSCLC development and could be leveraged in treatment strategies. Researchers from Chongqing Medical University, Suining Central Hospital, Chongqing University, and Sichuan University have discovered that the gene NF-kappa-B-activating protein-like (NKAPL) acts as a tumor suppressor in NSCLC by stabilizing the protein tripartite motif-containing 21 (TRIM21) and thereby inhibiting NF-κB signaling. Through a combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments, the team demonstrated that NKAPL, frequently silenced by DNA methylation in NSCLC tissues, can suppress cancer progression when re-expressed. The study began with a machine learning analysis of lung cancer methylation data from the TCGA database, where NKAPL ranked highly for its prognostic value. Researchers found NKAPL was significantly downregulated in NSCLC tissues due to promoter hypermethylation. In mouse models, NKAPL overexpression led to smaller tumors and fewer metastatic lesions. Mechanistically, mass spectrometry and immunoprecipitation revealed that NKAPL binds to and stabilizes TRIM21, a protein that regulates NF-κB signaling. These results reveal a new axis—NKAPL-TRIM21-NF-κB—that governs cancer cell behavior. "Our study not only uncovers a novel tumor suppressor role for NKAPL but also highlights its epigenetic silencing as a key event in NSCLC progression," said Dr. Tingxiu Xiang, corresponding author of the study. "The ability of NKAPL to enhance TRIM21 stability and dampen NF-κB signaling offers a promising therapeutic strategy, particularly for patients with advanced disease and limited treatment response. Further development of demethylation therapies targeting NKAPL could significantly improve patient outcomes." These findings pave the way for the development of new diagnostic biomarkers and targeted therapies for NSCLC. The frequent methylation of NKAPL suggests its potential utility in non-invasive screening via liquid biopsy. Therapeutically, strategies aimed at restoring NKAPL function—such as methylation inhibitors or gene delivery systems—could suppress tumor growth and metastasis by disrupting the NF-κB pathway. In the future, combination treatments involving NKAPL-targeted approaches and conventional therapies may offer more effective and personalized care for lung cancer patients.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two different lifestyle interventions improved cognition over 2 years in older adults at risk for cognitive decline, topline results from the Alzheimer's Association's US POINTER study showed. However, the high-intensity, structured intervention with more support and accountability led to significantly greater improvement on global cognition compared to a less intense, self-guided intervention. “Compared to the self-guided group, participants in the structured group performed at a level comparable to adults 1 to 2 years younger in age” — an effect that is “predicted to increase resilience against cognitive decline in the future,” principal investigator Laura Baker, PhD, professor of gerontology, geriatrics, and internal medicine at Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, said during a press briefing. At the same time, the potential to improve cognition with fewer resources and lower participant burden is “compelling [and] highlights that while not everyone has the same access or ability to adhere to more intensive behavior interventions, even modest changes may protect the brain,” Baker added in a news release from the Alzheimer's Association. US POINTER is the first large-scale randomized controlled clinical trial in the US to explore the impact of comprehensive lifestyle changes on cognitive health in older adults at risk for cognitive decline and dementia. Participants included 2111 adults aged 60-79 years who were sedentary and had a suboptimal diet and at least two other risk factors associated with late-life cognitive decline, including family history of memory impairment, elevated cardiometabolic risk, minority race, and male sex. They attended six peer team meetings over 2 years and chose lifestyle changes that would best suit their needs and schedules. Study staff provided general encouragement without goal-directed coaching. The primary comparison was the difference between intervention groups in annual rate of change in global cognitive function, assessed by a composite measure of executive function, episodic memory, and processing speed, over 2 years. After 2 years, both groups showed cognitive improvements compared to baseline on this primary outcome measure. This was based on the effect size reported in the FINGER trial, which also demonstrated cognitive benefits with a similar multidomain lifestyle intervention. The benefits of the lifestyle interventions in US POINTER were consistent across age, sex, ethnicity, heart health, and APOE4 gene status. “Cognitive benefits did not differ between APOE ε4 carriers and noncarriers, “suggesting that lifestyle interventions may be effective even among individuals at elevated cardiovascular or genetic risk of dementia,” the researchers wrote. “Future analyses of POINTER data, including additional cognitive measures, functional outcomes, fluid and imaging biomarkers, and longer-term cognitive trajectories, may help clarify the clinical significance and durability of these findings,” they noted. “The science of implementation is going to be very important,” Maria Carrillo, PhD, chief science officer and medical affairs lead, Alzheimer's Association, told the briefing. In a statement on the US POINTER topline results, Howard Fillit, MD, co-founder and chief science officer of the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation, said that “the future lies in precision prevention. We have seen this model succeed in cancer and heart disease, and with a growing body of evidence showing neither lifestyle nor drugs can stop Alzheimer's alone, now is the time to double down on studying the two in combination, which will lay the path for precision medicine.” “From a pragmatic clinical and public health perspective, the key message of US POINTER may be that even relatively modest lifestyle changes can support cognitive health in aging populations. The challenge ahead will be to determine how best to implement such programs widely, equitably, and effectively — and whether their benefits are maintained over time and translate into clinically meaningful end points,” Schott added. Schott also noted that existing public health measures to combat cognitive decline may already be having an impact. This study was supported by the Alzheimer's Association.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Exonate Ltd., a biotechnology company developing novel, non-invasive, small-molecule therapeutics for patients with retinal vascular diseases, today announced plans to initiate a Phase IIb clinical trial for its lead candidate EXN407. The CLEAR-DE (Clinical Evaluation of a New Eye Drop for Alleviating Retinopathy in Diabetic Eye Disease) trial will further evaluate the clinical efficacy, optimal dosing and safety profile of EXN407 in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR). In the study, lead candidate EXN407 met its primary safety and tolerability endpoints, with no drug-related serious adverse events, and high patient compliance. The Phase IIb trial to investigate the efficacy of EXN407 in NPDR patients is planned to begin in early 2026, with 140 patients currently enrolled across multiple sites in Australia, the Middle East and China. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss globally. An estimated one-third of the nearly 500 million people living with diabetes are affected by NPDR, the early stage of diabetic eye disease, which can lead to more severe, vision-threatening complications. Current therapeutic approaches involve monthly intraocular injections, initiated only after symptoms appear. This limits opportunities for early therapeutic benefit, and due to the invasive nature and frequency, is often deferred until irreversible damage has occurred. EXN407 is a first-in-class, twice-daily topical formulation of a selective SRPK1 inhibitor - a minimally-invasive approach with potential to become the first effective eye-drop therapy for NPDR and diabetic macular oedema (DME). Designed to modulate expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) via alternative mRNA splicing, EXN407 selectively inhibits the pro-angiogenic isoforms that drive disease progression, causing abnormal and leaky blood vessel formation in the retina. This therapy could transform the treatment landscape for early-stage disease by providing clinical benefit while avoiding the burden of injections, representing a significant advancement for patients and physicians alike.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a wide-ranging Genomic Press Interview published today in Brain Medicine, Dr. David R. Rubinow recounts the serendipitous path that led him to overturn decades of medical assumptions about hormone-related mood disorders in women. The interview reveals how a chance phone call accepting a fellowship position he had initially rejected set Dr. Rubinow on a trajectory that would fundamentally change how medicine understands and treats reproductive mood disorders. His discovery that women with conditions like premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), postpartum depression, and perimenopausal depression have completely normal hormone levels challenged the prevailing wisdom of an entire field. "I called him right back and said that I would be grateful to accept his invitation," Dr. Rubinow recalls of the moment that changed his career trajectory. That decision to work with Dr. Bob Post at the National Institute of Mental Health launched a 27-year career at NIH that would validate the experiences of millions of women whose hormone-related mood symptoms had been dismissed or misunderstood. Through meticulous research involving blinded hormone manipulation studies, Dr. Rubinow and colleague Dr. Peter Schmidt identified what they termed "differential sensitivity" – the phenomenon where susceptible women respond differently to normal hormonal fluctuations. This breakthrough shifted treatment approaches from attempting to normalize hormone levels to targeting the abnormal response mechanisms themselves. The practical impact of Dr. Rubinow's work materialized when his insights contributed to developing brexanolone (Zulresso), the first FDA-approved medication specifically for postpartum depression. Unlike traditional antidepressants, this neurosteroid treatment directly addresses the differential sensitivity mechanisms his research had uncovered. This interdisciplinary thinking enabled him to identify novel connections that yielded significant physiological insights. After establishing himself as a researcher, Dr. Rubinow brought his vision to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2006, serving as Chair of Psychiatry until 2019. During his tenure, he founded the UNC Center for Women's Mood Disorders, established (with Samantha Meltzer-Brody) the nation's first peripartum psychiatry inpatient unit, and created (with Susan Girdler) the first NIH-sponsored fellowship in women's mood disorders. His work has particular relevance as awareness of women's mental health continues to grow. By establishing reproductive psychiatry as a legitimate subspecialty with evidence-based treatments, Dr. Rubinow's research has provided hope and validation for women whose experiences were previously marginalized in medical settings. Dr. David R. Rubinow's Genomic Press interview is part of a larger series called Innovators & Ideas that highlights the people behind today's most influential scientific breakthroughs. By combining a focus on professional achievements with personal insights, this interview style invites a richer narrative that both engages and educates readers. This format provides an ideal starting point for profiles that explore the scientist's impact on the field, while also touching on broader human themes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The distinguished neuroscientist, recently honored with the Schizophrenia International Research Society's prestigious 2024 Global Schizophrenia Award, has established a unique research paradigm that combines cutting-edge neuroimaging with comprehensive clinical care in one of Latin America's most populous urban centers. The journey that led Dr. de la Fuente-Sandoval to become a leading voice in psychosis research began with displacement. This family history of interrupted scientific pursuit became a driving force that would later shape the younger de la Fuente-Sandoval's determination to build something lasting in neuroscience research. Guided by fellow resident Ariel Graff-Guerrero, who had completed advanced neuroscience training, Dr. de la Fuente-Sandoval embarked on spectroscopy studies that would fundamentally alter understanding of early psychosis mechanisms. This opportunity sparked an ambitious vision: developing imaging markers that could guide treatment selection rather than relying on the traditional trial-and-error approach that often delays effective intervention in young people experiencing their first psychotic episodes. Operating within Mexico City's sprawling metropolitan area of 22 million residents, where mental health resources remain severely limited, Dr. de la Fuente-Sandoval has engineered an innovative clinical research ecosystem. His team established a specialized outpatient clinic staffed by laboratory-affiliated psychiatrists while simultaneously implementing comprehensive evaluation protocols in the emergency department. This integrated approach ensures that first-episode psychosis patients receive immediate, thorough assessment including routine laboratory tests, head CT scans, and selective lumbar punctures based on clinical judgment. Remarkably, approximately 8% of patients presenting with first-episode psychosis are discovered to have secondary causes such as viral encephalitis or autoimmune conditions. Could this systematic screening approach, if implemented more broadly, prevent misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment in similar patient populations worldwide? All patients undergo comprehensive evaluation within 24 hours of emergency admission, including neuropsychological testing and MRI studies. This rapid assessment protocol serves dual purposes: enabling immediate treatment initiation while generating crucial research data. The entire process occurs at no cost to patients, addressing both scientific questions and healthcare access barriers simultaneously. The laboratory's most significant contribution centers on discoveries about glutamate dysfunction in early psychosis. Through sophisticated MRI spectroscopy techniques applied to antipsychotic-naïve patients, Dr. de la Fuente-Sandoval's team identified elevated glutamate levels specifically within the associative striatum. More importantly, they demonstrated that these elevations normalize following effective antipsychotic treatment. Rather than subjecting patients to potentially ineffective medications for weeks or months, clinicians might soon predict treatment response through baseline neuroimaging assessments. What implications might this hold for reducing the duration of untreated psychosis, a factor strongly associated with long-term outcomes? The research extends beyond glutamate to encompass electrophysiology, cognitive assessment, and inflammation markers. This multidimensional approach recognizes psychosis as a complex phenomenon requiring equally sophisticated investigative strategies. By integrating multiple biological markers, the laboratory works toward comprehensive predictive models that could transform clinical decision-making. Despite geographic and resource constraints, Dr. de la Fuente-Sandoval has positioned his laboratory at the forefront of international schizophrenia research. His leadership role in the ENIGMA Clinical High Risk for Psychosis Working Group facilitates data sharing and collaborative analyses across continents. This participation ensures that findings from Latin American populations contribute to global understanding of psychosis mechanisms. The laboratory's success challenges assumptions about where cutting-edge neuroscience can flourish. By leveraging Mexico City's large patient population and combining it with rigorous scientific methodology, the team generates insights unavailable in better-resourced but smaller research settings. How might other investigators in resource-limited environments replicate this model of turning apparent disadvantages into scientific opportunities? Dr. de la Fuente-Sandoval's Genomic Press interview is part of a larger series called Innovators & Ideas that highlights the people behind today's most influential scientific breakthroughs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bone fracture risk for women coming off menopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) increases sharply before showing a reduced long-term fracture risk compared with women who never took hormones, new data from a study published in The Lancet indicated. And it reconfirms that when you first go off the hormones, you're going to lose some benefit, which can translate into higher fracture risk and that needs attention,” certified menopause specialist Deborah Kwolek, MD, told Medscape Medical News. “I think this is a good wake-up call that we need to pay more attention to women's bone health starting at menopause,” said Kwolek, assistant professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston and founding lead of the Mass General Women's Health and Sex and Gender Medicine Program. “Our study suggests that, even after stopping menopausal hormone therapy, women could benefit from notably reduced fracture risk in older age. This likelihood holds for those who might have used menopausal hormone therapy for shorter periods because of concerns such as breast cancer,” the authors wrote. These results differ in some ways from some previous large studies, including the Women's Health Initiative post-trial study, which followed 15,187 women for 5 years but found no increased fracture risk after stopping hormone therapy. Kwolek explained that estrogen has long been known to be important for bone health, especially in the perimenopausal to menopausal transition and estrogen could prevent the bone loss that increases right at menopause. “We had been saying more recently that when women go off estrogen, there should be a plan for how their bone health may be addressed, potentially with medication and close monitoring,” Kwolek said. For a young, healthy woman who doesn't have osteoporosis, it's probably not terribly significant if her risk goes up a bit going off the hormones, Kwolek said, but “for a woman who's 70 and she comes off her hormones and already has osteoporosis, the effects may be more significant,” Kwolek said. “Maybe at that time you might start another medication to strengthen the bone.” The strengths of this study include its large dataset and long follow-up, Kwolek said. It also calls attention to an area of women's care that too often is overlooked. Whether in primary care or gynecologic appointments, she said, “people aren't paying as much attention to these transitions as I think they should,” Kwolek said.</p>
