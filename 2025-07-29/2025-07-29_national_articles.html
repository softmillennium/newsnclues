                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? On Monday evening in Midtown Manhattan, a 27-year-old gunman opened fire in an office building that houses NFL offices, killing four people, including a police officer and then himself. In a note left in his wallet, the shooter referenced chronic traumatic encephalopathy, commonly called by its initials CTE, and criticized the NFL for covering up the traumatic brain effects of playing football. The Times reported that the note also included references to NFL players who had also committed violent acts and were then diagnosed with CTE after their deaths. Seau's suicide in 2012, which reportedly followed his own mood changes, helped bring the link between an NFL career and CTE to the public's attention after his autopsy found evidence of the disease. More than a decade later, like many mental health conditions, CTE remains mysterious. The condition cannot be accurately diagnosed until after death and symptoms, such as trouble thinking clearly, can be hard to identify and easily confused with other neurological problems. We are still learning exactly how many people have CTE and exactly how much trauma is necessary for the disease to develop. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy is a degenerative brain disease, believed to be caused by repeated head injuries. Though more research on the condition is needed, scientists do not believe that a single head injury, such as a concussion, alone can cause CTE. CTE is most commonly associated with professional athletes who play contact sports, especially football and hockey, but has also been associated with those serving in the military. Other people, particularly victims of physical abuse, can also be at an elevated risk — the only known risk factor is recurring brain trauma. It seems like a straightforward question, but scientists and public health providers still don't have the full picture. Part of the challenge in recognizing CTE is that its symptoms are vague and can be confused with other forms of dementia, even Alzheimer's disease in older patients. But some of the commonly cited symptoms include: Patients are encouraged to get in touch with a health care professional if they experience any of those symptoms or if they suffer a serious head injury that could lead to brain damage. Unfortunately, there's no way to diagnose CTE in a living person. Currently, brain samples must be removed from the person and studied under a microscope — something that is not safe for a living patient. To diagnose CTE with certainty after a person's death, an autopsy collects evidence of damaged brain tissue as well as the build-up of tau proteins that have also been associated with Alzheimer's disease. New imaging technology could also provide a path to earlier CTE diagnosis. But for now, in living people, doctors can still attempt to screen for CTE as well as other similar conditions. If medical professionals suspect CTE, they will diagnose a patient with what is called traumatic encephalopathy syndrome, and provide behavioral or occupational therapy. That's why doctors still urge people who worry they could have CTE to get checked out. There is also no specific treatment for CTE; in general, nerve cells that die in the brain cannot be revived, which means the damage done by CTE cannot be reversed through medicine. We don't know — but it may be close. A 2023 study from Boston University's CTE Center found that 345 of the 376 former NFL players whose brains they studied had the condition. Though the authors cautioned against interpreting that finding to mean 90 percent of players have CTE — the brains donated to brain banks may not be representative of all players — the research would seem to suggest that playing a sport that involves violently crashing into other people, even with helmets and padding, leads to a higher chance of having brain damage. Part of the mystery with CTE is it's not clear why some people develop it and other people don't. Repeated head injuries clearly put you at risk — a separate BU study of NHL players concluded that the risk of CTE increased by 34 percent for every season played — but they are not enough on their own. Scientists still have more to learn about what causes some people to develop CTE while other people do not. But that doesn't mean we should ignore CTE's risks. New studies indicate even younger kids playing recreational sports face some danger of CTE. According to the Mayo Clinic, patients may also face a higher risk if they experience one head trauma and then another in quick succession, before their first injury can heal. One study published in JAMA Neurology in 2023 focused specifically on people who died before the age of 30 and were known to have repeated head injuries. Clearly, being an NFL lineman or NHL enforcer isn't the only way to develop CTE. Concerns have been raised about the accumulations of the micro-traumas that occur when, for example, heading a ball in soccer. Volleyball players, too, can be concussed during game play, which at least opens up the possibility of CTE risk. But what should be clear after this week's shooting in New York City is we need to make more progress quickly to prevent more tragedies. Some of us are much more sensitive than others. Millions more people will be taking a GLP-1 soon.</p>

The traffic stop in Shelby Township by Maryville Station CBP officers was triggered by a fake license plate on a vehicle. The group was named a foreign terrorist organization early on during President Donald Trump's second term, along with MS-13. Some of those alleged members have been sent to the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador for detention. "Zavala-Lopez is a serial criminal who's traveled across the U.S. committing violent crimes. He has an outstanding warrant for failure to appear on a felony assault charge in Denver, Colorado. He has also been charged with robbery resulting in physical injury, criminal possession of a weapon intent to use, assault, possession of stolen property and petty larceny in New York," DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. "Thanks to our brave law enforcement, he is off the streets and will no longer be able to terrorize American citizens. Alleged Tren de Aragua member Manuel Zavala-Lopez was arrested by United States Customs and Border Protection July 23, 2025, near Detroit. (Mike Kline (notkalvin) via Getty Images; U.S. Customs and Border Protection) "The arrest of this Tren de Aragua gang member, who has a history of firearms and other criminal charges and was wanted on an active warrant out of Denver, Colorado, for failure to appear, removes another dangerous criminal illegal alien from our country and enhances public safety," Detroit Sector Chief Patrol Agent John R. Morris said in a statement. "This marks the second arrest of a gang member from a foreign terrorist organization this month and underscores the relentless efforts of our agents and law enforcement partners. The 30-year-old, who is not named but had his mugshot disclosed by the agency, was previously charged with violent robbery as well as weapons and immigration violations, according to a news release. "This Tren de Aragua gang member, who had no business being in our country, let alone roaming the streets of Shelby Township, serves as our department's commitment to keeping our community safe and getting dangerous individuals like this out of our community," Lt. Mark Benedettini of the Shelby Township Police Department told Fox News Digital in an email. Two Salvadoran nationals in the country illegally were also arrested by CBP in Detroit earlier this month, the agency announced July 10. One of the men "admitted" to being a member of MS-13 and said he previously served 20 years behind bars in the Central American country for killing someone from a rival gang. Salvadoran police officers escort alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua recently deported by the U.S. government to be imprisoned in the Terrorism Confinement Center prison as part of an agreement with the Salvadoran government in Tecoluca, El Salvador, in a handout image obtained March 16, 2025.

The FDA is recommending that 7-hydroxymitragynine (also known as 7-OH) — a byproduct of the plant kratom — be classified as a Schedule I drug. HHS Secretary RFK Jr. and FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary emphasized the importance of getting ahead of yet another wave of addiction before it can sweep across the country. US Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. speaks alongside Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary (L) about the sending of warning letters to companies for illegally marketing products containing 7-hydroxymitragynine, also known as 7-OH, as part of their actions combatting opioids, during a press conference at HHS headquarters in Washington, D.C., on July 29, 2025. "Vape stores are popping up in every neighborhood in America, and many are selling addictive products like concentrated 7-OH. After the last wave of the opioid epidemic, we cannot get caught flat-footed again," Makary said in an FDA statement. "7-OH is an opioid that can be more potent than morphine. We need regulation and public education to prevent another wave of the opioid epidemic." During a news conference on Tuesday, Makary suggested that the public health community is often late to act against dangerous substances due to a "disconnect between the ivory towers and the streets." He then pondered aloud if experts had been to vape stores, as it "affects what we see in the operating room." Additionally, the substance is widely available and may be appealing to children and teens as it is sold in fruit-flavored gummies and even ice cream cones. The FDA is also warning that 7-OH products "may not be clearly or accurately labeled as to their 7-OH content and are sometimes disguised or marketed as kratom." It is semisynthetic and derived from the kratom plant whose leaves make a stimulant. There are no approved 7-OH drugs or diet supplements," FOX News Senior Medical Analyst Dr. Marc Siegel told Fox News Digital. "Bravo to the FDA for this move — it should be listed as a controlled substance." Kennedy spoke about his own battle with heroin addiction. The HHS secretary described his "iron willpower" and how he gave up candy and desserts for years, making him feel as though he could do anything, until he got his hands on heroin. "I felt that I could do anything with my willpower, but this compulsion was absolutely impervious to my will, and part of the problem was just the availability. It was too easy to get this drug for me," Kennedy said. Though the president has been sober his entire life, his brother, Fred Trump Jr., struggled with alcoholism for much of his life and died at the age of 43. And he would tell me, ‘Don't drink. Trump said at the time that he listened to his brother because he "respected him," adding that "to this day, I've never had a drink." Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., who attended the news conference, supported the recommendation based on his family's experience with addiction, though he did not detail exactly to whom he was referring. "It's an addiction that is ruining lives," Mullin said at a Tuesday news conference. He went on to thank Kennedy on behalf of his own family and "every single family that has dealt with this" for acting against the powerful drug. Additionally, the CDC found that "overdose deaths involving opioids decreased from an estimated 83,140 in 2023 to 54,743 in 2024." Kratom, the plant from which 7-OH is derived, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. The FDA notes that kratom is often used to self-treat a variety of conditions, such as pain, anxiety and depression. The agency notes that it has not approved any prescription or over-the-counter drug products containing kratom or its two main chemical components: mitragynine and 7-OH.

(AP Photo/Ty O'Neil) ▶ Follow live updates on the New York City office shooting NEW YORK (AP) — A gunman who killed four people at a Manhattan office building before killing himself claimed in a note to have a brain disease linked to contact sports and was trying to target the National Football League's headquarters but took the wrong elevator, officials said Tuesday. Investigators believe Shane Tamura, of Las Vegas, was trying to get up to the NFL offices after shooting several people in the lobby on Monday but entered the wrong elevator bank, Mayor Eric Adams said in interviews. Four people were killed, including an off-duty New York City police officer, Didarul Islam. Tamura, who played high school football in California nearly two decades ago but never in the NFL, had a history of mental illness, police said. The degenerative brain disease has been linked to concussions and other repeated head trauma common in contact sports such as football, but it can only be diagnosed after someone has died. In the note, Tamura repeatedly said he was sorry and asked that his brain be studied for CTE, according to the police department. The note also referenced former NFL player Terry Long, who was diagnosed with CTE, and the manner in which Long killed himself in 2005. The NFL long denied the link between football and CTE, but it acknowledged the connection in 2016 testimony before Congress and has paid more than $1.4 billion to retired players to settle concussion-related claims. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell called the shooting “an unspeakable act of violence in our building,” saying he was deeply grateful to the law enforcement officers who responded and the officer who gave his life to protect others. The shooting happened along Park Avenue, one the nation's most recognized streets, and just blocks from Grand Central Terminal and Rockefeller Center. It's also less than a 15-minute walk from where UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was shot and killed last December by a man who prosecutors say was angry over corporate greed. “I trust our Law Enforcement Agencies to get to the bottom of why this crazed lunatic committed such a senseless act of violence. Investigators found that Tamura drove across the country over the past few days and made his way into New York City just before the shooting, Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. Surveillance video showed the gunman exiting a double-parked BMW early Monday evening with a rifle, then marching across a plaza and into the skyscraper, which is also home to investment firm Blackstone and other companies. He then sprayed the lobby with gunfire, killing Islam, who was off-police duty and working a corporate security detail, and hitting a woman who tried to take cover, Tisch said. “He appeared to have first walked past the officer and then he turned to his right, and saw him and discharged several rounds,” Adams said in a TV interview. He then shot and killed himself, the commissioner said. Blackstone confirmed that one of its employees, real estate executive Wesley LePatner, was among those killed. Security officer Aland Etienne also died, according to a local labor union. Islam, 36, had served as a police officer in New York City for 3½ years and was an immigrant from Bangladesh, Tisch said at a news conference. His body was draped in the New York Police Department flag as it was moved from the hospital to an ambulance, with fellow officers standing at attention. “He was doing the job that we asked him to do. He made the ultimate sacrifice,” Tisch said. AP correspondent Julie Walker reports from the scene of Monday's deadly shooting in Manhattan - on a possible motive.</p>

A shooting Monday at an office building in New York City that is home to the Blackstone investment firm and the NFL left four people dead, including an NYPD officer. Covered by: Louis Casiano, Greg Wehner, Bradford Betz, Alexis McAdams, Christina Shaw, Alex Nitzberg, Greg Norman, Ryan Gaydos, Ryan Morik and Stepheny Price A lone gunman, identified as Shane Tamura, walked into a midtown Manhattan office building Monday and opened fire, killing four people before turning the gun on himself. The four people killed in the shooting were identified as NYPD Officer Didarul Islam, Blackstone executive Wesley LePatner, security guard Aland Etienne and an employee with Rudin Management. New York City Mayor Eric Adams said Tamura appeared to take the wrong elevator bank inside 345 Park Avenue Monday when he carried out his attack, adding that "it appears as though he was going after the employees at the NFL." By subscribing, you agree to our Privacy Policy. The Service Employees International Union, Local 32BJ, described Etienne as “a dedicated security officer who took his job duties extremely seriously.” We extend our deep condolences to the families and friends who lost loved ones tonight, including that of our own 32BJ SEIU security member Aland Etienne," the union's president Manny Pastreich said in a statement. “We have been in touch with Aland Etienne's family and are working with building management and the NYPD to support their investigation. We are ensuring our members in the building receive the free union counseling and support services they deserve and need to manage this unspeakable loss,” he added. “This tragedy speaks to the sacrifice of security officers who risk their lives every day to keep New Yorkers and our buildings safe,” Pastreich also said. Their contributions to our city are essential, though often unappreciated. “We are deeply saddened by the loss of four lives, including Police Officer Didarul Islam. Our thoughts are with their families, friends, and colleagues during this difficult time,” it wrote in a post on X. The four people killed in the shooting were identified as Islam, Blackstone executive Wesley LePatner, security guard Aland Etienne and Julia Hyman, an associate at Rudin Management. Fox News' Tamara Gitt and Ryan Gaydos contributed to this report. “Yesterday, my city -- the greatest city on earth -- was shattered when a gunman took the lives of four innocent New Yorkers in cold blood, just four blocks from my office in Midtown Manhattan,” Schumer said. “I actually worked in the building where the shooting took place for one summer as a summer associate at a law firm.” They're heroes, every one of them,” he added. “The Rudin family and everyone at our company are devastated by yesterday's senseless tragedy. We also thank the Mayor and Police Commissioner for their leadership. "As New Yorkers, we stand shoulder to shoulder in the face of this hatred, we grieve with the families and loved ones of those lost, and we pray for the full recovery of those injured.” Earlier this morning, financial firm Blackstone identified Wesley LePatner as an executive who was killed in the attack.

A person leaves flowers at a makeshift memorial outside scene of Monday's deadly shooting, on Tuesday, July 29, 2025, in New York City. A makeshift memorial is forming Tuesday outside 345 Park Avenue, the site of the shooting in New York City that left four people dead. Images taken at the scene showed bystanders leaving flowers. Goodell said in the memo, obtained by Fox News Digital, that one NFL employee was "seriously injured" but in stable condition. He mentioned Islam and thanked him for sacrificing his life to save others. He was a married father to two young boys, and his wife is pregnant with their third child, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. Fox News' Scott Thompson contributed to this report. "We are deeply saddened by the tragic incident that occurred yesterday in New York City. Mayor Eric Adams said in a news briefing on Tuesday that it is believed that the shooter, identified as Shane Tamura, was targeting the league - it is not known if specific people were intended targets. Adams added that the gunman alluded to having suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and that he had a grievance against the NFL in a "suicide note."

Kathy Hochul speaks at a news conference on Feb. 20, 2025, in New York City. The Democrat governor of New York is calling for a “national assault weapons ban” following the shooting in New York City last night. But our laws only go so far when an AR-15 can be obtained in a state with weak gun laws and brought into New York to commit mass murder. The American people are tired of thoughts and prayers,” she added. Congress must summon the courage to stand up to the gun lobby and finally pass a national assault weapons ban before more innocent lives are stolen.” Hochul also called the shooting a “horrific act of violence” and said her heart is with the loved ones of slain NYPD officer Didarul Islam, “his NYPD family and every victim of this tragedy.” NYPD officers respond to the scene of a shooting at 345 Park Ave in New York City on Monday, July 28, 2025. New York City Mayor Eric Adams revealed Tuesday that gunman Shane Tamura appeared to take the wrong elevator bank inside 345 Park Avenue Monday when he carried out his attack. Adams, speaking to Fox 5 New York, said "it appears as though he was going after the employees at the NFL." “And you see on the video that he discharged the weapon several times and we must commend Rudin Management for the safety precautions that they have put in place, even a safe bathroom where you can lock it down with a bulletproof door. Some of the staffers used that,” Adams continued. “It's unfortunate that during these days and times, active shooter drills are taking place all across the country and Rudin Management did their job of clearly having those active shooter drills and the staffers who were in the building were able to utilize some of the safe rooms and I believe it played a great role in saving lives of some of the staffers,” Adams added. But he did not go to that bank,” Adams also said. NYPD officers stand in line during the dignified transfer of Didarul Islam, who was shot and killed by a gunman Monday evening, out of NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Hospital to the medical examiner's office, early Tuesday, July 29, 2025, in New York City. “I trust our Law Enforcement Agencies to get to the bottom of why this crazed lunatic committed such a senseless act of violence,” he wrote in a post on Truth Social. Financial firm Blackstone identified Wesley LePatner as the executive who was killed in Monday night's shooting in New York City. LePatner, a senior managing director, was Blackstone's Global Head of Core+ Real Estate and the Chief Executive Officer of the Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust. “We are heartbroken to share that our colleague, Wesley LePatner, was among those who lost their lives in the tragic incident at 345 Park Avenue. “Wesley was a beloved member of the Blackstone family and will be sorely missed. Our prayers are with her husband, children and family,” it added. “We are also saddened by the loss of the other innocent victims as well, including brave security personnel and NYPD.” Blackstone said prior to LePatner joining their company, she “spent over a decade at Goldman Sachs, most recently as a Managing Director in the Real Estate Investment Group within the Asset Management Division. “She also worked in Goldman Sachs' Real Estate Principal Investment Area and Real Estate Investment Banking Group, where she began her career,” reads a bio of LePatner on Blackstone's website. New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced Tuesday that “As a mark of respect for the memory of NYPD Officer Didarul Islam who died in the line of duty and the multiple victims of the mass shooting in Midtown Manhattan at 345 Park Avenue yesterday, I've ordered all flags on all city buildings and stationary flagstaffs throughout the five boroughs to be lowered to half-staff until further notice.” “Officer Didarul Islam died as he lived, a hero and protector of New York City. We will never forget you,” Adams wrote in another post on X. Tamura was a high school football player at Granada Hills Charter in Granada Hills, California, which is about 25 miles northwest of Los Angeles.

Three other people were killed – including a New York City Police Department Officer – during the attack. “He was protecting New Yorkers from danger when his life was tragically cut short today,” it added in a post on X. “We join in prayer during this time of incomprehensible pain. He was a married father to two young boys and his wife is pregnant with their third child, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. Both of the officers were working there as part of the paid detail program, which allows companies to hire uniformed officers as extra security, Tisch said.

Goldman made the remarks when responding to comments by Trump-backed Ohio gubernatorial hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy. This isn't just tragedy, it's the cost of weak leadership and anti-cop policies. Tamura has been identified as the lone gunman who walked into a midtown Manhattan office building this afternoon and opened fire, killing four people – including an NYPD officer – before turning the gun on himself. Photos taken by Fox News Digital show officers outside of the gated community believed to be the residence of lone gunman Shane Tamura in Las Vegas on Monday evening. Tamura can be seen on surveillance video exiting a BMW and carrying a rifle as he enters the Park Avenue skyscraper that is home to Blackstone and the NFL headquarters. Upon entering the building, he opens fire on an NYPD officer and a woman as they attempt to take cover before “spraying” the lobby with gunfire. He then makes his way to the elevator where he allows a woman to go free before taking a ride to the 33rd floor where he shoots additional victims and then finally takes his own life. The dignified transfer of the late NYPD Police Officer Didarul Islam takes place at New York Presbyterian Well Cornell Medical Center after midnight following the mass shooting attack that killed him and three others while wounding a fifth person in Manhattan, New York, United States on July 29, 2025. NYC Mayor Eric Adams also took part, praising Islam as a hero who died protecting fellow New Yorkers. He was protecting New Yorkers,” Mayor Eric Adams said in a news conference at the Manhattan hospital where he was pronounced dead. “He embodies what this city is all about. NYPD responds to active shooter reports in midtown Manhattan building The office building, which sits on 52nd Street and Park Avenue, was the site of a tragic mass shooting that left five dead, including one police officer, when a gunman unleashed fire inside before taking his own life. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell sent a message, obtained by Fox News Digital, to all league employees announcing the traumatic event. Read the full report by Fox News Digital's Scott Thompson here. New York City Mayor Eric Adams shared a video on X early Tuesday morning as he was en route to the hospital to conduct a dignified transfer of officer Didarul Islam. In the video, Adams expressed condolences and honored Officer Islam's ultimate sacrifice. “I'm on the way to the dignified transfer of fallen police officer Didarul Islam, who was killed in tonight's senseless mass shooting in Midtown Manhattan. He put his life on the line for all of us and died a hero. Islam lost his life after a lone gunman walked into a midtown Manhattan office building Monday afternoon and opened fire, killing four – including an NYPD officer – before taking his own life. Police Commissioner Jessica S. Tisch confirmed in a press conference late Monday that there is no longer an active threat to the public. NYPD believe that the now deceased gunman acted alone. A lone gunman walked into a midtown Manhattan office building Monday afternoon and opened fire, killing four people – including an NYPD officer – before turning the gun on himself. Tisch said Tamura had driven across state lines, with his vehicle having been seen as recently as 4:24 p.m. Monday in Columbia, New Jersey, not long before he unleashed a barrage of gunfire. Read the full report by Fox News Digital's Bradford Betz here. Security video shows the gunman who killed multiple people at an office building in midtown Manhattan entering the lobby and immediately opening fire and striking several people, including a police officer, authorities said Monday. He then shot a security guard taking cover behind a desk with an M4 assault rifle, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. The gunman, identified as Shane Tamura, then waited for an elevator and allowed a woman to exit unharmed before going to the 33rd floor. He then shot and killed another person before shooting himself, police said. Tamura, who was licensed to carry a concealed weapon in the state of Nevada, killed four people and wounded another. “Our hearts go out to the victims of this horrific act and their families,” a statement from KPMG said. "We are incredibly grateful for the bravery of building security and law enforcement." Didarul Islam, 36, was identified as the NYPD officer killed during Monday's shooting. Didarul Islam, 36, had been on the force for four years before he was gunned down Monday evening. He was a married father to two young boys and his wife is pregnant with their third child, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. "He put himself in harms way," Tisch said. Both of the officers were working there as part of the paid detail program, which allows companies to hire uniformed officers as extra security, Tisch said. New York Mayor Eric Adams, a former NYPD officer, said he met with Islam's family. "This was his dad's only son," he said. "It is unimaginable to experience a loss of this magnitude." Shane Tamura, the suspected gunman who killed five people, including an NYPD officer, inside a midtown Manhattan office building, drove across the country to New York City from Las Vegas, authorities said Monday. Tamura traveled through Colorado on July 26, and through Nebraska and Iowa the next day, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said during a Monday night news conference. Tamura's vehicle was then seen in Columbia, New Jersey as recently as 4:24 p.m. Monday, not long before he would unleash a barrage of gunfire in New York, police said. NYC Mayoral Candidate Zohran Mamdani briefly speaks with reporters as he leaves the Dirksen Senate Office Building on July 16, 2025 in Washington, DC. New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mandani is facing renewed scrutiny for his past stances on policing in the wake of an office building mass shooting in midtown Manhattan that left four civilians dead as well as a police officer. In the replies, people quickly shared images of a June 8, 2020, post where Mamdani said "No, we want to defund the police" and a Nov. 5, 2020, post where he said "Queer liberation means defund the police." This is an excerpt of a story by Fox News Digital's Cameron Arcand. The shooter who killed five people in a midtown Manhattan office building on Monday was identified as Shane Tamura. Law enforcement officials located identification on Tamura's body, including a concealed carry permit from Las Vegas, the people said. Employees working on the 33rd floor of the Blackstone building in midtown Manhattan barricaded themselves inside their office as a gunman opened fire inside. Pictures from inside the office show couches stacked up at the entryway in an effort to prevent anyone from entering. In another picture, employees were seen adding even more pieces of furniture to the stack. He later went to another floor, where he shot multiple people, before heading to the 33rd floor and shooting himself. Ultimately, five people were killed, not including the shooter. Four people were killed, including an off-duty police officer working security, after a gunman opened fire inside the Midtown Manhattan office building.

Fox News host Greg Gutfeld and the panel discuss Pete Buttigieg's $80 billion investment in diversity, equity and inclusion in aviation on ‘Gutfeld!' FIRST ON FOX: Duke Health, the medical arm of Duke University in North Carolina, is seeing more than $100 million in federal funding frozen in compliance with President Donald Trump's executive order prohibiting DEI practices. In a letter to Duke President Vincent Price, Chairman of the Board of Trustees Adam Silver and School of Medicine Dean Mary Klotman, Secretaries Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and Linda McMahon outlined that racial preferences in hiring, student admissions, governance and patient care "betray" the mission of American health care and "endanger human lives." "There is arguably no other area of our educational system where the rejection of merit is more dangerous than in medicine, where the competence of doctors means the difference between life and death for patients, and where scientific discovery is the difference between life-saving cures and the ravages of disease." Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (Getty Images) Kennedy and McMahon said their respective agencies have been investigating allegations that Duke Health's practices may be violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and Section 1557 of the ObamaCare law. The Civil Rights Act code cited prohibits recipients of financial assistance from denying benefits or discriminating against individuals based on race, color or national origin. They called such racism "vile" and said it "hides behind a smug superiority" that "such [so-called] ‘benefitted' races cannot compete under merit-based consideration." "Affirmative action undermines America's commitment to merit-based justice and violates the nation's civil rights laws. In the medical context, this illegal preferencing also breaks faith with patients, hinders medical discovery, and jeopardizes human life and health." The feds kept the door open to future partnerships with Duke, noting the school and hospital have long had a commitment to medical excellence and would prefer to see it "repair these problems." In order to return to good standing, Duke Health must review all policies and procedures in terms of illegal use of race preference, take immediate action and provide verifiable assurances to Washington that the medical unit will operate in "good faith" once more. "If the alleged offending policies, practices, and programs are found to exist and remain unrectified after six months, or if at any time the Merit and Civil Rights Committee and federal government reach an impasse, the federal government will commence enforcement proceedings as appropriate," the secretaries warned in closing. Fox News Digital reached out to Duke via Price's office and also solicited comment from Silver via his day job as NBA commissioner. Charles Creitz is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former President Joe Biden's open border immigration crisis led to an “extraordinary” surge in legal and illegal migrants into the United States and new population highs in 31 states and the District of Columbia. During Biden's four years, California added 1.4 million migrants and Texas 1 million, but several other states shared in the burden of having a huge influx arrive to compete for jobs and taxpayer-funded social services, according to an analysis of the data by the Center for Immigration Studies. Under Biden, millions of migrants came to America, mostly illegally. It used that word again when it revealed where new illegal and legal migrants are landing: “The South now has the largest immigrant population. The increase has been extraordinary,” said the report, which focused on where Biden-era border crossers ended up. “From the first quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of 2025 the foreign-born population grew by more than one-third in 16 states.” And, it said, “In the first quarter of 2025, the foreign-born share of the population hit historic highs in 14 states: Alabama, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Maryland, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. Numerically, the foreign-born population hit record highs in 31 states plus the District of Columbia.” “Our analysis of the size of the growth of the foreign-born population across the country shows that it has become a truly national issue in a way that was not the case four and a half decades ago,” the report concluded. “This is likely to be true for the foreseeable future.”</p>

HONOLULU (AP) — A major hurricane was churning across the Pacific Ocean but was several hundred miles south-southeast of Hawaii and posed no threat to the islands, forecasters said Tuesday. Hurricane Iona is one of two major weather systems in the central Pacific Ocean. In its latest advisory, the Miami-based U.S. National Hurricane Center said Iona was about 765 miles (1,230 kilometers) away from Honolulu, with maximum sustained winds near 125 mph (205 kph). Additional strengthening was forecast later on Tuesday, with steady weakening expected to begin by Wednesday. It continues to trek west over warm, open waters. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Keli has maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph), the NHC said Tuesday morning. It was about 890 miles (1,435 kilometers) southeast of Honolulu and was moving west at about 13 mph (20 kph). No coastal watches or warnings were in effect for the storms. “All counties are monitoring,” agency spokesperson Kiele Amundson said in an email. Another indirect impact from the weather systems could be swells, but they are relatively small and moving westward and won't create anything significant, said Derek Wroe with the weather service in Honolulu. However, a large swell is headed toward Hawaii after being generated several hundred miles east of New Zealand. “People might wrongly attribute the swell energy to be from these tropical systems, but they're actually not,” he said.</p>

MONTREAL (AP) — Throughout his new term, starting with his inaugural address, President Donald Trump has said he was “saved by God” to make America great again. As Canada and the U.S. now skirmish over Trump's tariff threats and occasional bullying, the leaders' rhetoric reflects a striking difference between their nations. His ally, House Speaker Mike Johnson, says the best way to understand his own world view is to read the Bible. Such high-level religion-themed displays would be unlikely and almost certainly unpopular in Canada, where Carney — like his recent predecessors — generally avoids public discussion of his faith. President Donald Trump holds a Bible as he visits outside St. John's Church across Lafayette Park from the White House in Washington, June 1, 2020. Prime Minister Mark Carney speaks during a news conference in Ottawa, Friday, May 2, 2025. There is no major campaign in Canada to post the Ten Commandments in public schools or to enact sweeping abortion bans. Christianity, Kee said, has not permeated modern Canadian politics to that extent. “We have a political leadership that keeps its religion quiet,” Kee said. The Catholic Church was Quebec's dominant force through most of its history, with sweeping influence over schools, health care and politics. A worker arranges candles inside the Votive Chapel at the national shrine of Saint Joseph's Oratory of Mount Royal, in Montreal, June 28, 2025. “I feel isolated because our traditional Christian views are seen as old-fashioned or not moving with the times,” said Mégane Arès-Dubé, 22, after she and her husband attended a service at a conservative Reformed Baptist church in Saint Jerome, about 30 miles (nearly 50 kilometers) north of Montreal. “Contrary to the U.S., where Christians are more represented in elected officials, Christians are really not represented in Canada,” she added. “For many aspects of it, that was good,” he said. “Before that, it was mainly the Catholic clergy that controlled many things in the province, so we didn't have religious freedom.” Nonetheless, Denault wishes for a more positive public view of religion in Canada. “Sometimes, secularism becomes a religion in itself, and it wants to shut up any religious speech in the public sphere,” he said. “What we hope for is that the government will recognize that religion is not an enemy to fight, but it's more a positive force to encourage.” Denault recently hosted a podcast episode focusing on Trump; he later shared some thoughts about the president. People look at a sculpture that pays tribute to migrants and refugees at the national shrine of Saint Joseph's Oratory of Mount Royal. “We tend to think that Trump is more using Christianity as a tool for his influence, rather than being a genuine Christian,” he said. The public servant should not identify with a specific religion,” Denault said. “I don't think most Canadians would vote for that type of politician.” In the Montreal neighborhood of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, the skyline is dotted with crosses atop steeples, but many of those churches are unused or repurposed. For decades, factory and port workers worshipped at Saint-Mathias-Apotre Church. Today it's a restaurant that serves affordable meals daily for more than 600 residents. The manager of Le Chic Resto Pop, Marc-Andre Simard, grew up Catholic and now, like many of his staff, identifies as religiously unaffiliated. But he still tries to honor some core values of Catholicism at the nonprofit restaurant, which retains the church's original wooden doors and even its confessional booths. “There's still space to be together, to have some sort of communion, but it's around food, not around faith.” Simard said during a lunch break, sitting near what used to be the altar of the former church. The group's co-founder, Michel Virard, said French Canadians “know firsthand what it was to have a clergy nosing in their affairs.” Now, Virard says, “There is no ‘excluding religious voice' in Canada, merely attempts at excluding clergy from manipulating the state power levers and using taxpayers' money to promote a particular religious viewpoint.” Why are Canada and the U.S., two neighbors which share so many cultural traditions and priorities, so different regarding religion's role in public life? According to academics who have pondered that question, their history provides some answers. The United States, at independence from Britain, chose not to have a dominant, federally established church. Megane Ares-Dube, center, prepares to receive communion during service at the Reformed Baptist Church in Saint Jerome, Quebec, Sunday, June 29, 2025. Worshippers pray during service at The Reformed Baptist Church. “This is a country in which free faith communities have been allowed to compete in the marketplace for their share,” he said. “In the 20th century, you had a plethora of religious groups across the spectrum who all competed voraciously for access to power,” he said. Carmen Celestini, professor of religious studies at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, said that even when Canadian politicians do opt for faith-based outreach, they often take a multicultural approach — for example, visiting Sikh, Hindu and Jewish houses of worship, as well as Christian churches. Trump's talk about Canada becoming the 51st state fueled a greater sense of national unity among most Canadians, and undermined the relatively small portion of them who identify as Christian nationalists, Celestini said. “Canada came together more as a nation, not sort of seeing differences with each other, but seeing each other as Canadians and being proud of our sovereignty and who we are as a nation,” she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A conservative watchdog group that began investigating former President Joe Biden's use of the autopen long before any congressional investigations started is furious over a lack of transparency and what it says are officials stonewalling information requests at the Justice Department. But after more than four months, it says the government is still resisting compliance with the FOIA requests despite granting expedited processing. It's unacceptable given the gravity of what we're asking for.” In response to growing scrutiny over his predecessor's use of the autopen, President Donald Trump ordered the White House counsel and the DOJ in June to investigate whether Biden's staff unconstitutionally exercised executive authority during Biden's final year in office. But Brosnan said Trump's own DOJ, led by Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, is stonewalling the release of necessary records for the watchdog's research project. “President Trump deserves credit for being visible and accessible to the press, but the DOJ is not following his lead — especially not in this case.” “If you have an OLC opinion saying, ‘Hey, Mr. President, you need to sign these things,' and he didn't, that throws additional fuel onto the fire,” Brosnan said. “We're asking for documents that may show the president ignored binding legal advice.” Despite Brosnan's concerns, a federal judge this week approved the DOJ's request to postpone its next FOIA update until September. Brosnan said the delay contradicts Trump's push for aggressive transparency in government. The agency's recent reports have suggested that standards are changing to address historic backlogs from previous years. According to its 2025 Chief FOIA Officer Report, the department processed a record-breaking 157,180 requests in fiscal 2024, up from just 82,868 two years earlier, while reducing its backlog by more than 50%. “We got some stuff recently,” Dewey told the Washington Examiner. “Growing backlogs, agency failures to make timely determinations, arbitrary denials of requests, and excessive invocation of FOIA exemptions has made the government less transparent. … The average American, by and large, has been cut out,” Howell said. “For reasons we cannot explain, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche are covering up records related to the Autopen Scandal. UNFORTUNATE LITIGATION UPDATE133 days is enough.For reasons we cannot explain, @AGPamBondi and @DAGToddBlancheare covering up records related to the Autopen Scandal. This prompted speculation about whether Biden made the final call on those decisions. After Republican lawmakers began investigating Biden's autopen in early May, a July 13 report from the New York Times revealed that Biden staffers, including chief of staff Jeff Zients, used the device to carry out sweeping clemency grants under Biden's name. Meanwhile, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) has continued interviews of several former Biden officials, including Dr. Kevin O'Connor, Anthony Bernal, and Annie Tomasini, the three aides who have so far invoked the Fifth Amendment in response to committee questioning. Interviews are expected to continue this week on Wednesday with Steve Ricchetti, Biden's former counselor, and on Thursday with Mike Donilon, Biden's former senior adviser.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Goodwill, Easterseals and other nonprofit organizations say thousands of low-income seniors could soon be unemployed because funding hasn't come through for a decades-old federal job training and placement program. The Department of Labor has yet to release more than $300 million in funds for national grantees of the Senior Community Service Employment Program, which was created in 1965 to help low-income, out-of-work adults 55 and older — especially veterans, rural residents and people with disabilities — return to the workforce. On July 1, the Department of Labor released about $86 million in funds to state recipients, but the national grantees' funds were not released (something that's typically done in May), several of the longtime participating nonprofit organizations told CNN. These moves are coming at a time when hiring activity has continued to slow in the broader US labor market. Such potential cuts couldn't be coming at a worse time, Davenport said. “If you look at a macro level at what is impacting these seniors, there are Medicaid cuts, so their health care might go away,” she said. “There are massive [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] cuts. Many of these folks are dependent on SNAP for food assistance; that's going away. And now SCSEP is taking away their opportunity to work.” She added: “We're putting people who really do want to help themselves in a terrible position.” His Labor Department is trying to cut off a pipeline of workers “The Department has given all SCSEP grantees a one-month period of performance extension, so that if grantees have funding available from their Program Year 2024 grant, they can still use these funds to continue program operations,” Christine Feroli, a Labor Department spokeswoman, wrote via email to CNN. “The Employment and Training Administration is preparing to award grants shortly after state and territorial grantees submit their required budget documents. The department will support grantees in their operations and services to participants.” “This funding delay is not just a bureaucratic issue, it's a crisis for tens of thousands of older adults who depend on SCSEP to survive,” Clayton Fong, president and CEO of the organization that provides employment programs and caregiving services for older adults, said in a statement earlier this month. “SCSEP is a job training program that restores dignity and a sense of purpose to seniors who want to continue working but are often overlooked in the workforce,” Fong said. “This funding pause has painful consequences for jobseekers who are trying to build skills and take care of themselves and their families.” Fong's organization has furloughed more than 800 senior workers. At Goodwill Industries, more than 400 program participants were placed on leave of absence status; and if funds are not released by July 31, additional furloughs could impact more than 1,500 of its older workers, the nonprofit said in an emailed statement to CNN.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As part of the deal reached in Scotland between President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Europe agreed to accept 15% import tariffs on most goods, with exceptions. “It's kind of a testimony to the normalization of protection,” said Bill Reinsch, an expert in trade policy with the Center for Strategic and International Studies who served for 15 years as president of the National Foreign Trade Council. “Because if in March, if anybody in the EU had said we're going to accept a 15% tariff, you know, they would have been thrown out of the room.” “And here it is now, sort of this is what we're going to do ­— it's kind of an extraordinary evolution,” Reinsch told the Washington Examiner. Over the years, presidents have sought to reach agreements with trade partners to lower trade barriers on both sides by offering the inducement of easing tariffs and restrictions imposed by the U.S. Economists generally argue that tariffs only hurt consumers, because the higher costs will be passed along to them. Trump, in contrast, views imposing higher tariffs on other countries while gaining greater access to their markets as a victory, and appears to have achieved that outcome in the talks with the EU. Trump has argued that imposing tariffs on trading partners will help rebalance the U.S. trade deficit. “So, yeah, I think this is a very big deal.” Another White House official called the deal “the big one” and emphasized that talks are ongoing with several countries, including some other “large fish.” “President Trump appreciates President Von Der Leyen's efforts to reach this deal, and fully trusts and expects the EU will live up to their bold, new commitments.” The agreement has also been poorly received by some political figures in Europe. “This agreement has succeeded in averting a trade conflict that would have hit the export-oriented German economy hard,” German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said, according to Reuters. EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic has also argued that this is “clearly the best deal we could get under very difficult circumstances.” Then, the markets tanked, and investors raised fears about a recession. Major U.S. stock indices also were largely flat as the information was digested. Notably, many details of the deal reached between Trump and von der Leyen are still unclear. “I think that swapping uncertainty with some higher degree of certainty is a kind of positive,” Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate, told the Washington Examiner. He pointed out that the 15% rate is still far higher than before the Trump administration came into office, and there are open questions related to inflation and economic growth. “There aren't too many people in Europe that are looking to drive an Escalade down a narrow Roman street,” he said. Toomey said that he thinks the U.S. is undergoing a readjustment in its approach about tariffs and trade policy. “I think you're finally starting to see that a lot of these economists were in the groupthink dogma, and that they've been wrong for many decades, except for the team of economists at CPA,” Toomey told the Washington Examiner. Overall, how the trade deal will affect each side remains to be seen. Reinsch, with CSIS, said that it is in the best interest of both sides to put a good face on the deal. “So I think it was a smart move on von der Leyen's part to seek a direct meeting, because I think she figured out that if you want to close, that's really the only way to do it,” Reinsch said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A years-old House Intelligence Committee report now available to the public appears to contradict statements made to Congress by Brennan in 2017, a document that was recently declassified by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard as part of a broader document dump she claims is evidence of a “treasonous conspiracy” by Obama officials to undermine Trump in 2016. However, Republicans on Congress's intelligence committees suggest they have more pressing matters than nearly a decade-old testimony outside the statute of limitations for lying to lawmakers and that the Department of Justice is better equipped to investigate such allegations. “I would let the federal agencies be able to walk back through it. Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD) was unfamiliar with the House report but saw “other issues out there right now that are a lot more pressing.” He did not offer specific examples. Sen. James Risch (R-ID), who also chairs the Foreign Relations Committee, declined to comment beyond expressing a desire for the Trump administration's investigations to play out. The declassified information, coupled with other reports released by CIA Director John Ratcliffe and special counsel John Durham, suggests Brennan may have violated intelligence community standards, relied on information from the Steele dossier, and excluded contradicting evidence on Russian efforts to intervene for Trump's benefit. Ratcliffe has suggested Brennan won't have statute of limitations protections because he believes there remains a conspiracy. Brennan has rejected accusations of treason and manufacturing fake intelligence to hurt Trump's election chances as “baseless.” Gabbard referred Barack Obama last week to the DOJ for prosecution, despite current and former presidents having legal immunity from official acts taken in office. Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) criticized the House's declassified report as “partisan” and disqualifying. Gabbard has not directly rebutted the findings by the Senate or other government entities that agreed Russia launched a sweeping interference operation, but has suggested they were based on fake Obama-era intelligence. “I would caution anybody on either side to take something that's one party,” Kelly said. Some House Intelligence Committee Republicans expressed more willingness to reopen the matter, given that it was their panel's report. Its chairman, Rep. Rick Crawford (R-AR), referred to Brennan as “a documented liar, full stop.” But he added that “accountability isn't always about prosecuting individuals,” a likely reference to Brennan's testimony being outside the five-year statute of limitations for prosecution. “In some cases, prosecuting may not be possible, but we can hold them to account by removing them from the [intelligence community] and ending their career as deep-state operatives,” Crawford said. Rep. Greg Steube (R-FL) said he would support congressional hearings and investigations. Republicans on other panels of potential jurisdiction, such as Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and John Cornyn (R-TX) of the Judiciary Committee, want Attorney General Pam Bondi to appoint a special counsel.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Roy Cooper launched his Senate run Monday, boosting party hopes of winning the seat opened by retiring Republican Sen. Thom Tillis. They are looking for several more wins just like it to have a chance of flipping four Republican-held seats and going after a goal that seemed far out of reach earlier this cycle: taking the Senate majority next fall. They also have to defend seats in four potentially competitive states: Georgia, where Sen. Jon Ossoff is up for reelection, and Michigan, Minnesota and New Hampshire, where the party's incumbents are all retiring. In New Hampshire, Rep. Chris Pappas, another top Democratic recruit, is running for Senate, while on the Republican side, former Gov. But Democrats are trying to resolve conflicts in other races on the board and prevent  drawn-out primaries that could hurt their chances next November. “Governor Cooper is a formidable candidate who will flip North Carolina's Senate seat, and his announcement is the latest indication that the Republicans' Senate majority is at risk in 2026,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and his Senate campaign chief, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, said in a statement to CNN. Michigan's open Senate race is the one that most worries national Democrats, according to half a dozen lawmakers, senior aides and strategists. Democrats are facing a competitive primary that includes three well-known contenders: Rep. Haley Stevens, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow and progressive former gubernatorial candidate Abdul El-Sayed. Several of the Democratic sources CNN spoke to said Schumer and his team have privately signaled they believe Stevens is the strongest general election candidate. In another nod to Stevens' Democratic establishment support, she earned an endorsement from former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi earlier this summer. And two people involved in Michigan politics said Gillibrand has privately encouraged donors to support Stevens. A spokesperson for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee declined to comment on Gillibrand's behalf, but offered an upbeat statement that Democrats would hold the seat next November. Democrats there have also been surprised by the strong fundraising power of El-Sayed — backed by independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders — who has been urging his party to take a more aggressive stance on Trump. Democrats in the state are still hoping they can unite behind a candidate before next August's primary. They also fear that the state's race for governor won't help either: Mike Duggan, the popular Detroit mayor, has decided to run as an independent, potentially splintering the Democratic base and raising questions about what that could mean for Michigan's Senate and House races. “I don't think people understand how dysfunctional the Senate race is,” one Michigan Democrat told CNN of the bruising three-way primary. Texas is a red state, but Republicans face an increasingly bitter primary battle between Sen. John Cornyn and his conservative challenger, MAGA-aligned state Attorney General Ken Paxton — one that intensified with the news that Paxton's wife, state Sen. Angela Paxton, had filed for divorce. A third potential candidate, Rep. Wesley Hunt, has not ruled out a bid and has been spending small sums on advertising, with more expected in the coming weeks. Another Republican often mentioned as a possible contender, Rep. Ronny Jackson, is one of Trump's closest allies in Texas. Democrats believe Paxton would be a weaker general election candidate if he wins the Republican primary. But they could face a messy primary of their own. Former Rep. Colin Allred, the party's losing nominee in the 2024 Senate race, has already launched his campaign, with his supporters pointing to how he outran Kamala Harris in key parts of the state last November. Some officials and donors have sought to steer potential Senate candidates into other races, urging state Rep. James Talarico to run for governor and US Rep. Joaquin Castro to run for attorney general, three people familiar with the matter said. However, it's not clear that Talarico or Castro are moving toward those races themselves. Talarico told CNN last week he is “certainly thinking about” running for higher office, and will make decisions about his political future after Texas' special legislative session, which began last week and can last no more than 30 days. “Once that's over, I am going to look at how I can best serve, and that includes the US Senate,” Talarico said. “I'm not taking anything off the table right now.” Castro and his office did not respond to CNN's request for comment. He testified in a Texas legislative hearing last week, opposing a GOP push during the special session to redraw the state's congressional lines. Castro told state lawmakers they are “being used by the White House and Donald Trump.” O'Rourke's political action committee has hosted events with many of the Texas Democrats weighing statewide runs. Talarico, Castro, Rep. Jasmine Crockett and others spoke at a rally Friday in Austin. Uncertainty looms over two other states Democrats hope to target: Ohio and Iowa. The party's hopes of defeating Ohio Republican Sen. Jon Husted — who was appointed by Gov. Mike DeWine in January to fill the seat formerly held by Vice President JD Vance — largely depend on whether former Sen. Sherrod Brown, who lost his reelection bid in 2024, attempts a comeback. Iowa is also a question mark, with operatives buzzing for months over rumors that Republican Sen. Joni Ernst — who faced backlash after dismissing concerns about Medicaid funding cuts by telling a crowd that “we are all going to die” — could retire. “There's always all kinds of chitter-chatter everywhere, but I have a lot left to do in the United States Senate, so I am not slowing down any time soon. However, Republicans have a deep bench in the red state. The still-growing Democratic field in Iowa already includes state Rep. J.D. Scholten, state Sen. Zach Wahls and Knoxville Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Nathan Sage. Democrats are waiting for a decision from former Rep. Mary Peltola, who lost her House seat to GOP Rep. Nick Begich last year but is viewed as perhaps the only Democrat who could turn that Senate race into a competitive one.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian swimmer Vladyslav Bukhov knows better than anyone just how fine the margins in his sport can be. That title etched Bukhov into Ukraine's sporting history, making him the country's third-ever long-course (competitions held in a 50m pool) world champion. At the time, Bukhov was a relatively unknown figure in elite swimming, with only a few thousand social media followers. Ostensibly emerging out of the blue, Bukhov's journey – like most gold medalists – started long before the pageantry of international swim meets and media spotlight. “People will look and see that I'm world champion. But what they don't see is how long the road and the journey is to that medal and podium,” Bukhov said. “I have been swimming since the age of seven. Bukhov's unlikely success becomes more impressive once learning that despite starting the sport at age seven, he didn't swim in a competitive race until he was 15 years old in 2018. When asked why it took him so long to transition into competitive swimming, Bukhov explained that his introduction to the sport was never based around “dreams of medals or fame.” Swimming didn't become my main focus until I was a teenager,” he recalled. So, in the beginning, I saw it as just a small part of my sporting life. That's when my parents stepped in and said they would take me to a proper coach.” Like all Ukrainians, Bukhov's life has been deeply affected by Russia's aggression toward his homeland. Only 11 years old at the time, Bukhov and his family were forced to leave their home and travel 10 hours west to the relative safety of Kyiv. “It was a very scary time for us all,” the swimmer said. “My main memory is just the sadness of needing to leave where I was from and move to somewhere completely new.” After nearly eight years in the nation's capital, the pain of fleeing Donetsk had started to feel like a distant memory for Bukhov. Those memories came flooding back for him and his family, though, in late February 2022, when Russian forces crossed Ukraine's eastern border and encircled Kyiv just a few days later. “I thought we had left all the fighting behind us. When I woke up that morning and heard the news that Kyiv had been surrounded, I struggled to believe my family and I had found ourselves in the same situation all over again.” For elite athletes like Bukhov – who rely on routine and stability – training and preparation have had to be heavily adapted. We can't even do simple everyday things, let alone all the stuff that professional athletes have to do,” Bukhov said. “Air raid sirens constantly interrupt our lives – whether we're in the pool, in the gym, or just trying to sleep at night. We can't do anything without this constant fear.” He adds that there have been many occasions where he and his teammates were mid-session in the pool when the screech of air raid sirens forced them to rush to shelters still wrapped in towels. There is always pride in representing your nation on the international stage, but for Ukrainian athletes like Bukhov, that pride has grown even deeper as the war rumbles on. “As an athlete, I feel even prouder now. I am competing for more than just my own glory,” the 22-year-old said. Heavyweight boxing champion Usyk pleads with Trump, inviting him to spend a week in Ukraine: ‘Open your eyes, help my people' “When I travel abroad to competitions, I'm one of the lucky few who gets to temporarily leave the war. … Normal people don't get a break from the bombing and the sirens, so I try to do my part in my own way. “I tell myself that if I swim fast and continue to break records, people back home will get a small distraction from reality and feel pride that Ukraine is still succeeding despite everything. For some, that means going to university or an office. “If everyone does their job in Ukraine – no matter how small – it can make a big difference collectively. Heading into the swimming portion of the World Aquatics Championships, Bukhov is aiming to return to his best form – something that eluded him at last summer's Olympic Games in Paris. I was a little bit sick and wasn't able to perform my best or live up to my own standards,” he told CNN Sports. “Let's see where that leaves me on the podium. With Ukraine's airspace closed, Bukhov will take a nine-hour train west to the Polish border before crossing into the town of Chełm. From there, he'll take a further three-hour train ride to Warsaw, where he and his teammates will finally board a flight to Singapore. In total, they will spend more time traveling to the airport from Kyiv than they will in the air en route to Southeast Asia.</p>
