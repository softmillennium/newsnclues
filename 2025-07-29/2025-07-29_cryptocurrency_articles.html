                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin — once warily regarded as the domain of chumps and criminals — can now buy you a house. One of the world's largest luxury brokerages just launched a division solely dedicated to digital currency transactions. Its newly minted team of lawyers, analysts and crypto experts is expected to meet a growing demand for all-crypto real estate deals. The bold move marks a first among major real estate firms. Aaron Kirman, CEO of a Christie's affiliate in Los Angeles, is spearheading the new division. Kirman has handled high-profile listings like the estates of Rodney Dangerfield and Cary Grant, as well as the former home of Yolanda Hadid and Kiley Jenner. While it's common practice for privacy-minded billionaires and celebrities to purchase properties behind anonymous shell corporations, even all-cash deals between iron-clad shell companies can be sleuthed out from time to time. Real estate deals made with crypto remain rare, but lucrative. A Bel Air mansion, dubbed La Fin, is worth $118 million, and currently stands as the priciest-ever home listed for crypto. Roughly 14% of American adults today own at least some cryptocurrency, according to a recent Gallup poll. President Trump's housing director, William Pulte, said in June he would instruct Fannie Mae and Freddie Mack to consider crypto assets as part of a homebuyer's loan application. Washington DC is increasingly embracing digital currency under the Trump administration. Christie's did not respond to a request for further comment on the news.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Altcoins slid sharply Tuesday as traders braced for a wave of economic events, including a Federal Reserve interest rate decision due Wednesday. Leading the pack are XRP, solana SOL$181.20 and cardano ADA$0.7783 which all fell more than 3% over the past 24 hours as well as dogecoin DOGE$0.2212, avalanche AVAX$24.10 and sui SUI$3.8256 which are down more than 5%. DOGE plunged even further, about 18% over the same period. Bitcoin BTC$117,504.76, on the other hand, is trading roughly flat over the past 24 hours at $117,312. Altcoins have been under pressure since early last week as traders piled into leveraged bets. A packed calendar of economic data is adding stress to both crypto and equity markets. The U.S. Federal Reserve's two-day meeting kicked off Tuesday with Jerome Powell's team expected to leave rates unchanged yet again on Wednesday, despite pressure from President Donald Trump to lower rates. Traders are also looking to Friday, when a fresh U.S. nonfarm payrolls report hits the market as well as a number of Trump tariff deadlines. U.S. stocks wiped out earlier gains with both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 now each modestly lower.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hype too often influences policymakers when it comes to regulating markets. In his July Mansion House speech, he reiterated his scepticism over the need for a “Britcoin” central bank digital currency or a UK stablecoin, with tokens issued by finance houses and backed by their sterling reserves. As Donald Trump signs stablecoins into US law and rebrands private dollars with political colours, Sir Andrew's caution isn't just prudent, it's essential. The governor's view is that UK banks should not be allowed to issue their own stablecoins. George Osborne, the former Tory chancellor who advises a large cryptocurrency exchange, argued that Mr Trump's embrace of stablecoins, which are privately issued digital money, means Britain must sign up to remain relevant. The former Labour cabinet minister Ed Balls considered this naive, given recent history. When a commercial bank issues a stablecoin, it is effectively minting its own currency – without, as the Bank for International Settlements noted, the backing, oversight or “lender of last resort” guarantees of a central bank. This creates a parallel financial market, one prone to runs, crashes and contagion – just as happened in 19th-century America's free banking era, when half the new banks collapsed, many unable to honour the notes they had issued. Yet Mr Trump is pressing ahead by letting banks and even non-banks issue dollar-pegged crypto assets. He is also leveraging the power of his office for personal gain in plain sight. One of the Trump family's cryptocurrencies is conservatively estimated to have pulled in at least $320m since January, while another received a $2bn investment from a foreign government wealth fund. Steven Levitsky of Harvard University spoke for many when he told the Guardian this summer that he had “never seen such open corruption in any modern government anywhere”. Cyber-libertarians view cryptocurrencies as a tool to evade state control, regulation and taxation, aligning with radical rightwing ideas about government as a problem. This seems to be the view of Paul Marshall, the UK hedge fund tycoon and media baron, who sees a Manichean world of central bank fiat versus free-market cash. Such ideological takes don't help with stable capital markets or effective consumer protection. Britain's financial sector should be smaller for the country's long-term health, but it must still remain competitive – on regulatory terms that preserve stability, not simply to keep pace with Trump-era financial populism or petro-state opportunism.

People in the cryptosphere need to stop slapping the word “truth” on whitepapers that read like AI fanfic – there's only one project that deserves it: TOKEN6900 (T6900). And the truth is, it's raised over $1.3 million in its ICO without offering a morsel of utility or a single plan of action. A project that doesn't need “personality traits” like ChatGPT will eventually roll out, because TOKEN6900 already has a personality baked in: effortlessly unserious, terminally online, and dangerously chill. And those who understand it are already tuned into Channel 69, the only broadcast worth watching this cycle. And in less than 24 hours, the $0.00675 presale price per T6900 disappears. If it touches $0.0069, don't be surprised when meme rapture hits the chain. Billionaire Ray Dalio, on the other hand, sees it differently. To him, the U.S. is staring down an accelerating debt burden and long-term currency devaluation. In a recent podcast, he recommended allocating 15% to Bitcoin (BTC) and gold – a massive leap from his 2022 guidance of just 1.5%. Ray Dalio suggests putting 15% in #Bitcoin, #gold amid US ‘debt doom loop': CointelegraphBillionaire hedge fund manager Ray Dalio recommended a 15% portfolio allocation to Bitcoin or gold for optimal "return-to-risk ratio" amid America's debt crisis, during an appearance on the… pic.twitter.com/O2wFz9eV5V While banks convince depositors that holding fiat is safe, Dalio's basically saying it's like storing ice cubes in the desert and calling it wealth preservation. TOKEN6900 strips it back to what matters and the truth is simple: you could drop an asteroid on the world, and somewhere there'd still be a T6900 holder, headphones on, vibing through the end of times. Nobody ever says that's what matters with TOKEN6900 – and certainly not its holders. What matters for TOKEN6900 is vibe liquidity and its growing congregation of terminally online traders. That's not entirely true… although the Church of 69 does raise eyebrows, especially with that whole “swear on the Old TestaMeme” thing. Either way, those who understand the principle – staying true to what it is and what it represents, which is pure absurdity – get the idea. That's why TOKEN6900 proudly calls itself the first NCT: Non-Corrupt Token. As the scriptures never said, man shall not live by bread alone, but by memes and eternal vibes – TOKEN6900 was never about the money. The hard cap means that, no matter how many try to ape in later, they'll have to wait until it hits the exchanges. And at the current rate, tomorrow could mark the 30% milestone, which in meme numerology probably means absolutely nothing, but we'll take it as a sign anyway. It's simply that the initial tokens are the ticket to the congregation – those who can proudly say, this is what it means to be a meme coin, and I'm with it through flood, fire, and rugpull. TOKEN6900 staking returns offer a 44% APY and are available to newly purchased tokens. Actually there are no fears of any rugpull since the token is audited by top security firms and also available for purchase in Best Wallet, the Certik-approved mobile crypto app. Best Wallet is available now on Google Play or the Apple App Store.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act on 18 July, 2025 Image: REUTERS/Nathan Howard Stablecoins have quickly become one of the most closely watched topics among global financial institutions and governments. Their usage and impact are growing rapidly, increasing 28% since this time last year, with transaction volumes surpassing that of Visa and Mastercard combined in 2024. However, fewer than 10 major economies around the world have adopted stablecoin-specific legislation. With this bill, it joins a growing list of countries seeking to bring oversight and stability to the rapidly expanding digital asset ecosystem. This act aims to provide clear regulatory guardrails for the industry. • Stablecoin issuers are limited to insured depository institutions, e.g. banks, credit unions, subsidiaries of banks and nonbank financial institutions that receive approval from the Federal Reserve and demonstrate the ability to comply with the relevant law. • Stablecoin issuers must hold 1:1 reserves for any stablecoins issued. These reserves can be held in physical currency, US treasury bills, repurchase agreements and other low-risk assets approved by regulators. • The act provides that all stablecoin issuers must comply with the Bank Secrecy Act, ensuring all stablecoin issuers implement measures protecting against money laundering (AML) and the financing of terrorism (CFT) and bolstering consumer protection. For example, in December 2024, the European Union's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) came into effect and Hong Kong recently released its Stablecoin Ordinance. EMTs refer to digital tokens backed by a single fiat currency, while ARTs are digital tokens backed by a basket of assets, which could include physical assets, cryptocurrencies, or others. Under MiCA, only e-money institutions or credit institutions can issue an EMT, while ART issuers must be EU-based and authorized by regulators. Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Stablecoin Ordinance, passed in May 2025, is one of the more recent pieces of stablecoin legislation passed worldwide. The World Economic Forum's Platform for Shaping the Future of Blockchain and Digital Assets ensures equity, interoperability, transparency, and trust in the governance of this technology for everyone in society to benefit from blockchain's transformative potential. Contact us for more information on how to get involved. President Trump has stated that the bill “is going to make America the UNDISPUTED Leader in Digital Assets.” Professor Barry Eichengreen of the University of California, Berkeley noted that: “If panicked customers force [stablecoin issuers] to sell [treasuries backing stablecoins], Treasury prices could collapse, sharply increasing interest rates and destabilizing other financial markets and our entire economy.” Globally, Chinese state media called for yuan-backed digital currencies to be pursued “sooner rather than later.” Wary of the GENIUS Act's potential to proliferate the US dollar worldwide and thereby increase dollarization, Zhou Xiaochuan, former governer of the People's Bank of China, stated: “Unless facing extreme, dire circumstances – such as [fighting] high inflation or heavy debt burdens – pursuing dollarization could bring many adverse side effects.” In the EU, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde shared similar concerns, emphasizing US dollar-denominated stablecoins' threat to monetary policy and European autonomy and pushing for the development of a digital euro. Here are three recommendations to ensure consistent and thorough stablecoin regulation around the world: Any future regulation should continue to comply with global standards for interoperable regulations. Consistent communication between the public and private sectors is critical to ensure stablecoins are developed with a common goal. Even beyond stablecoins, more comprehensive global regulation is needed in other areas of the digital assets ecosystem, including decentralized finance and broader crypto assets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ETH continues to show strength with record open interest and high network activity as bulls expect an upside breakout soon. Ether's open interest has doubled since June 22 to a record high of $58 billion. High network activity and a record stablecoin supply signal strong demand. Ether futures open interest (IO) hit a record high of $58 billion on Tuesday, indicating increased market participation and new money flowing into ETH futures contracts. Aggregate OI in Ether futures has more than doubled since June 22, up 10% over the last two days. For context, three months earlier, on April 29, Ether's OI was $20.75 billion when the price hovered around $1,800. Additionally, when Ether traded around $4,000 in December 2024, ETH futures open interest was only $31.5 billion. Related: Evolving ETH futures data hints a potential rally to $5K This metric just hit new record highs, suggesting increased demand for leveraged ETH positions. ETH OI dominance has also “climbed to nearly 40%,” its highest in over two years, Glassnode wrote in part to a Tuesday post on X. #Ethereum open interest dominance has climbed to nearly 40%, its highest level since April 2023. This marks a clear shift in speculative focus, with capital rotating from $BTC to $ETH at the margin. The weekly DEX volume also hit a 4-month high of $22.6 billion, according to DefiLlama, while the weekly App revenue hit a 6-month high of $89.8 million. Stablecoin supply also reached an all-time high of $132.5 billion on Tuesday, signaling increased liquidity and demand. “Ethereum network activity is going through the roof,” said popular analyst Elja in response to these onchain metrics, adding: Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows ETH trading around $3,800, up 6% over the last seven days. As Cointelegraph reported, breaking $4,000 is key to ETH's upside potential and sets the stage for a possible rally to new all-time highs. “$ETH Slowly creeping its way up to those cycle highs,” Daan Crypto Trades said in his latest Ether analysis on X. Daan Crypto Trades explained that it would be” healthier” for ETH to consolidate below this level before breaking, as the rally has been sudden already.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced Tuesday, it has officially launched its long-anticipated licensing regime for stablecoin issuers, with new guidelines set to come into effect August 1. The move latest update shows Hong Kong's intention to regulate the growing stablecoin sector, offering clarity for market participants while reinforcing investor protection and financial integrity. These were accompanied by summary notes detailing licensing application procedures and transitional provisions for existing issuers. Institutions interested in applying must contact the HKMA by August 31 to receive early-stage feedback, with a submission deadline of September 30 for those ready to proceed. The HKMA has warned that misleading claims regarding licensing status could result in criminal penalties. Issuers already active in the market are expected to gradually bring their operations into compliance. The HKMA is developing a regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers to mitigate risks, enhance user protection and safeguard financial stability, so as to unlock the potential of digital asset and foster its development in Hong Kong. By introducing a clear licensing regime, the HKMA said it aims to make sure that only well-governed, transparent, and properly capitalized players can operate in the space. Beyond protection, the framework also reflects Hong Kong's ambition to lead in regulated digital finance. With robust guardrails in place, the city can attract quality innovation, support institutional engagement, and strengthen its reputation as a global financial hub. The move comes as authorities seek to cool market euphoria and protect retail investors from hype and fraud in the digital asset space. The HKMA's strategy is clear: responsible innovation, backed by strong oversight, is key to unlocking the benefits of digital money while minimizing its risks. While the current focus is on private stablecoins, this regulatory rollout could be a precursor to broader digital currency ambitions. Hong Kong has been actively exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), both at the wholesale and retail levels.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins Aubrey Strobel, a Bitcoin podcaster and former communications executive at Lolli, has co-founded Halcyon, a New York-based boutique communications firm specializing in emerging technologies such as Bitcoin, stablecoins, and artificial intelligence. Halcyon's services extend beyond traditional public relations to include content creation, video production, and tailored go-to-market strategies. The firm adopts a "VC approach," aligning with founders through long-term partnerships and prioritizing brands that align with its thesis on Bitcoin, DeFi, AI, and stablecoins reshaping global systems [1]. Her X following of nearly 150,000 and background in producing a Bitcoin-themed film—"Lekker Feeling: A Bitcoin Ekasi Story"—underscore her focus on narratives that bridge innovation and public understanding [1]. The firm's timing coincides with a pivotal period for crypto and AI. Additionally, reports suggest up to 15 crypto-related IPOs could materialize within two quarters [1]. By blending market insight with cultural awareness, Halcyon aims to position clients as pioneers in a rapidly evolving sector. However, the firm's success will depend on its ability to differentiate itself in a crowded PR landscape and deliver measurable growth for early-stage clients. The launch reflects broader trends in crypto communications, where brands increasingly seek to align with regulatory progress and public sentiment. With the U.S. regulatory landscape shifting and investor appetite for tech-driven narratives rising, Halcyon's focus on Bitcoin and stablecoins may capitalize on the sector's momentum. Yet, the firm's emphasis on storytelling risks facing skepticism in markets where technical execution often outweighs marketing.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Additionally, the launch of a PyTorch-integrated quantum AI toolkit marked a significant step toward making quantum computing more accessible for machine learning developers and data scientists, particularly those working on hybrid classical-quantum workflows. D-Wave's management in this regard noted that, while still early-stage, these developments are closely aligned with system sales opportunities rather than the company's Quantum Computing-as-a-Service (QCAAS) segment. According to D-Wave, such innovations are geared toward customers seeking to deploy their own on-premises systems for high-security, high-throughput use cases, including blockchain and advanced AI modeling. The company suggested that this integration of quantum capabilities into real-world development ecosystems could open the door for commercial traction across both enterprise and government verticals. D-Wave's current focus on partner discussions and proof-of-concept (POC) pilots around its blockchain framework and PyTorch-integrated AI toolkit could pave the way for future system sales or licensing deals. As second-quarter 2025 earnings approach, attention will be on whether these early-stage efforts have translated into commercial traction.

IonQ IONQ: It is advancing in quantum AI through its gate-based architecture, focusing on hybrid AI model training and partnerships with cloud providers. While strong in developer tooling and quantum machine learning, IonQ is yet to introduce a blockchain framework like QBTS, leaving a potential gap in its emerging markets strategy. Rigetti Computing RGTI: The company remains hardware-focused, prioritizing qubit fidelity and government contracts via its QCS platform. Though exploring AI, it lacks blockchain-specific initiatives and domain toolkits like D-Wave's PyTorch integration, making its approach more tech-centric and less diversified across emerging commercial applications.

[2025] UKFTT 900 (GRC)

29 Jul 2025

The First Tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) has dismissed an information rights appeal against a decision of the ICO concerning materials held by the FCDO.

The materials sought by the Appellant concerned an investigation by the Cabinet Office into the behaviour of the former Minister, Mr Christopher Pincher MP. The ICO had held that the FCDO was entitled to rely on exemptions under sections 40(2)(personal information) and 36(2)(c)(prejudice to the effective conduct of public affairs) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. The First Tier Tribunal agreed with the FCDO's submissions that the relevant materials were exempt from disclosure and dismissed each of the Appellant's grounds of appeal.

The FCDO was represented by Jason Pobjoy KC and Tom Watret.

The judgment can be found here.

This announcement represents a complete strategic transformation for 180 Life Sciences. The company is raising $425 million through a private placement to establish an Ethereum treasury, with plans to rebrand as ETHZilla Corporation. The backing from over 60 institutional and crypto-native investors, including prominent Ethereum ecosystem founders, gives this pivot substantial credibility. Electric Capital will serve as external asset manager implementing an on-chain yield generation program designed to outperform traditional ETH staking through diversified strategies including staking, lending, and liquidity provisioning. What distinguishes this approach from other crypto treasury strategies is the formation of a DeFi Council comprising ecosystem leaders to advise on yield generation while supporting Ethereum's development. The company also plans to issue up to $150 million in debt securities following the PIPE, which could further impact its financial structure. This strategic pivot represents a remarkable departure from 180 Life Sciences' previous focus, essentially transforming it into a financial vehicle for institutional Ethereum exposure through traditional markets. PALO ALTO, Calif., July 29, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- 180 Life Sciences Corp. (Nasdaq: ATNF) (the "Company" or "180 Life Sciences") today announced that it plans to adopt a treasury policy under which the principal holding in its treasury reserve will be Ether ("ETH"), the native digital asset of Ethereum. The offering consists of an approximately $425 million private investment in public equity transaction ("PIPE") for the purchase and sale of common stock (and pre-funded warrants, if applicable). Over 60 institutional and crypto-native investors in the PIPE transaction including Harbour Island, Electric Capital, Polychain Capital, GSR, Omicron Technologies, Konstantin Lomashuk (Co-Founder Lido and p2p.org), Sreeram Kannan (Founder, Eigenlayer), Mike Silagadze (Founder,  Ether.fi), Danny Ryan (Co-Founder, Etherealize), Vivek Raman (Co-Founder, Etherealize), Sam Kazemanian (Co-Founder, Frax), Grant Hummer (Co-Founder of Etherealize), Robert Leshner (Founder, Compound and Superstate), Tarun Chitra (Founder, Gauntlet) and several other prominent Ethereum ecosystem founders and leaders. At closing, we expect to assemble an incredible team of well-regarded veterans across traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi) to help guide this new chapter in the Company's journey." At closing, Electric Capital will serve as the external asset manager for the Company, and plans to implement a differentiated, on-chain yield generation program. This program will be designed with the goal of outperforming traditional ETH staking, while maintaining robust risk management, seeking to leverage a combination of staking, lending, liquidity provisioning and bespoke private agreements. "As we arrive at the ten-year anniversary of Ethereum, we're proud to partner with the Company to support a treasury strategy that will be community-designed and strategically deployed." The Company plans to launch with a key partner in Etherealize. Etherealize brings key strategic partnerships with current leaders in the Ethereum ecosystem which may provide ongoing marketing and amplification value to the Company's Treasury Strategy. At closing, Etherealize and a consortium of leading DeFi builders will act as a DeFi Council to offer input to the Company on how it may use its treasury to generate outsized yield while also benefiting the Ethereum ecosystem. Clear Street LLC acted as financial advisor and exclusive placement agent for the PIPE offering.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One tool that's quickly gaining popularity is Gemini, Google's AI assistant. After all, Gemini is capable of scanning the internet, pulling insights from traders, and corroborating multiple data points from a wide range of sources, which gives it a uniquely broad and fast-evolving view of the market. That said, there's still a compelling case for human analysts when it comes to understanding crypto markets. The best analysts have verifiable track records, regularly share their findings on platforms like X and Reddit, and can explain their picks with a level of nuance and intuition that AI hasn't quite matched yet. And after combing through its latest recommendations, we can confidently say that Gemini passed with flying colors. By integrating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), $HYPER's new Layer 2 will set the stage for cutting-edge dApps to be developed and maintained right on Bitcoin. These Layer 2-compatible tokens can then be used to engage in high-speed DeFi trading, lending, staking, and swapping protocols, NFT marketplaces, and blockchain-based gaming dApps, among other uses. Bitcoin Hyper is currently in presale, meaning you can buy it for a super-low price of $0.01245. And the project has in total raised over $5.6M so far. According to our $HYPER price prediction, the token could surge by up to 1,500% and reach $0.20 by the end of 2026. It's also non-custodial, meaning you get total control over your private keys, no more relying on third parties that can be hacked or go out of business. Combined with rock-solid MFA options, including biometric authentication, advanced cryptography, and even crypto insurance, Best Wallet ensures your digital assets remain secure from unauthorized access. Best Wallet is on track to capture over 40% of the entire non-custodial crypto wallet market by 2027, and you can become part of this growth by buying $BEST. In addition to potentially making over 2,300% in the next year or so, buying and holding $BEST unlocks a slew of exclusive perks. One $BEST is currently available for just $0.025405, and the project has so far amassed a whopping $14.3M. The viral Pepe the Frog has spawned countless meme clones in recent months, but few have made waves like Pepecoin ($PEP). What sets $PEP apart is its own proof-of-work blockchain. That's right; it's not an ERC-20 or BNB-based token, but a fully independent chain. Pepecoin also features a functional wallet ecosystem, and its mission is simple: to offer digital money that's open-source, permissionless, and truly run by the community. This makes it one of the very few top meme coins that take decentralization seriously, echoing the grassroots ideals of Bitcoin itself. At the time of writing, $PEP has gone slightly sideways, but given that its newfound momentum could rocket it to the moon in the coming weeks, its current price of $0.00059 seems like a solid entry point. Savvy investors are turning to cutting-edge AI tools like Gemini to get a read on the ever-changing altcoin market, and potentially spot explosive tokens like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and Best Wallet Token ($BEST) before they blast off. That said, it's important to remember that even the smartest AI models can make mistakes, so their insights should always be taken with a grain of salt.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>GameSquare Holdings, Inc. has drawn attention by acquiring CryptoPunk #5577, a well-known NFT, for $5.15 million through preferred shares. Following the deal, CryptoPunk #5577 officially became a strategic treasury asset of GameSquare. While NFTs have long been speculative digital collectibles, a new wave of companies treating them as treasury assets may redefine their role in corporate finance, if the market holds. It places NFTs on the same level as other recent reserve crypto assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Garga, CEO of Yuga Labs — the company behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection — predicted that NFT treasury companies will become a trend. He also expressed a desire to see an APE-focused treasury company. “The world isn't ready for NFT treasury companies, but they are coming anyway,” Garga said. Medved believes the NFT market cap is small but still has massive growth potential. Other NFT investors also argue that NFTs hold a unique advantage — their strong cultural and social elements. “But I think there's way more to it. This won't be just a cold finance strategy like what Michael Saylor is doing. It will involve real social dynamics,” NFT investor Loki said. A recent report from BeInCrypto noted that the floor prices of CryptoPunks and Moonbirds have surged, signaling a potential comeback of the NFT season. According to data from Dune, NFT marketplace volumes exploded in July. Additionally, Nathan Frankovitz — an analyst at VanEck — cited data from CryptoSlam, noting that Ethereum NFT trading volume on July 23 spiked to the highest level since May 2022. This data shows renewed interest in NFTs, creating favorable conditions for businesses to consider these assets as part of their strategic reserves. If this movement gains momentum, the most promising NFT collections likely to benefit would include Pudgy Penguins, CryptoPunks, and Bored Ape Yacht Club. Even though NFT industry leaders believe that NFT treasury companies could revolutionize corporate finance — similar to how MicroStrategy used Bitcoin — the intrinsic value of NFTs remains hotly debated, even within the crypto sector. Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana, bluntly criticized NFTs and memecoins in a recent discussion on X (formerly Twitter). People spend $150B a year on mobile gaming,” Yakovenko said. Using crypto as a strategic reserve has faced doubt since its early days. Then, retail investors would buy shares in companies holding high-value NFT portfolios. The cycle could break if capital inflows weaken and NFT prices crash. Therefore, assets used for strategic reserves must demonstrate sustainable growth. Historically, this is where NFTs fundamentally differ from Bitcoin. This news article aims to provide accurate, timely information.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>July alone contributed more than $1.5 billion in net inflows, with BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) leading the charge at over $87 billion in assets under management. The milestone triggered a massive short squeeze, wiping out $415 million in bearish positions within 24 hours as traders scrambled to cover bets. However, cracks in Bitcoin's absolute dominance are starting to show. Over the past week, Ethereum ETFs have seen consecutive inflows, which were up to $332 million over two days, while Bitcoin ETFs recorded their largest two-day outflow in months. This trend signals a structural rotation into Ethereum and select altcoins, as investors diversify from the market leader into assets with higher utility potential and growth narratives. With this shift, early-stage Web3 projects are coming into focus, especially those offering real-world use cases like gaming and DeFi. There are more such top undervalued altcoins to buy now that can help you diversify your portfolio, and let's check the details! Below-mentioned is a list of the top undervalued altcoins to buy now: While earlier Bitcoin ETFs surged high and now the market transitioned towards Ethereum ETFs, the capital rotation is creating a stir amongst amateur investors. With institutional investors diversifying into assets offering real utility, platforms like Tapzi aim to capture attention by addressing the shortcomings of traditional GameFi models. Unlike speculative play-to-earn ecosystems that often face inflationary pressures, Tapzi focuses on skill-based Player-versus-Player (PvP) gaming, creating an economy rooted in competition and fair play.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum Layer-2 Linea Reveals Token Plans, Taps SharpLink and Others for Distribution And to further that aim, the network's builders shared plans to launch a LINEA token for the chain with an associated ecosystem fund. Linea creator Consensys said its plan revolves around a commitment to the Ethereum base layer with new ecosystem mechanics like native yield on bridged ETH and ETH burns. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.) The network also plans to benefit users on-chain as well, directly burning 20% of all net transaction fees (paid in ETH) while using the remaining 80% of net fees to burn LINEA, creating a deflationary flywheel proportional to network activity. “As Linea grows, it actually provides value back to ETH holders directly," said Fox, who added that the network's builders really see Linea as an extension of Ethereum. That network alignment was apparent to newly appointed SharpLink co-CEO Joseph Chalom, who said in a statement that “Linea's commitment to Ethereum couldn't be more clear,” and that its “unique alignment with Ethereum will make [Linea] an important part of its future.” The alignment between Ethereum and its layer-2s hasn't always been seen as a positive though, with some investors and analysts suggesting that the scaling networks have taken value away from Ethereum's mainnet. That problem was acknowledged by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in January, who said that ecosystem developers need to “think explicitly about [the] economics of ETH,” going as far to suggest layer-2s burn a portion of their fees to support ETH—the same endeavor Linea is undertaking. Summary: raise the blobs, work hard on interop and security, think about economics. That future has seemed brighter of late, as ETH has charged back towards a price of nearly $4,000 in recent weeks, hitting a 2025 high in the process. However, it still remains more than 21% off its all-time high of $4,878 from 2021. (Disclosure: Myriad is a product of Decrypt's parent company, DASTAN.) “For us, it will be the amount of ETH capital actively deployed on Linea mainnet,” he added. “We intend to provide the best risk-adjusted return for ETH capital.” The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The cryptocurrency market has been witnessing a strong rally this month. Ethereum (ETH) rebounded sharply and is up more than 57% in the past month. Meanwhile, this space gathers momentum predominantly through favorable regulatory developments. At this stage, it should be fruitful to invest in crypto-centric stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank for near-term gain. Stablecoins are digital assets that are built to maintain a stable value relative to a “stable” asset like the US dollar. Giant retailers such as Walmart and Amazon are considering launching their own stablecoins to reduce dependence on traditional payment networks like plastic money. The CLARITY Act would establish a regulatory framework for digital assets other than stablecoins. This will allow crypto exchanges to register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission thereby reducing the Securities and Exchange Commission's regulation of digital currencies. The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act aims to prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) directly to individuals or indirectly through intermediaries. The bill also prohibits the Federal Reserve from developing or issuing a CBDC without explicit authorization from Congress.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This breakthrough eliminates common risks associated with cross-chain solutions, such as vulnerabilities inherent in bridging protocols or wrapped tokens, fundamentally transforming blockchain interoperability. dWallets enable both the user and the Ika network to collaboratively sign transactions, while enforcing logic governed by smart contracts. The technological core of Ika is its novel 2PC-MPC cryptography protocol, previously thought impractical for decentralized environments due to latency, scalability, and security constraints. Ika has overcome these hurdles, delivering sub-second latency and linear scalability, without compromising on decentralization, delivering a network that can be supported by hundreds of operators globally. Each operation includes cryptographic safeguards that require explicit user participation, supporting a zero-trust security framework. The network's native token, IKA, plays a critical role by securing the infrastructure through a decentralized, permissionless proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. IKA tokens are integral for transaction fees, spam prevention, rewarding reliable operators, and network governance. Several leading blockchain projects on Sui are already utilizing Ika's mainnet, demonstrating the protocol's versatility and robustness: “Today marks the start of a new era in blockchain interoperability,” said Ika Co-Founder Omer Sadika. “Our mainnet launch is not just a technological milestone, but a paradigm shift, bringing native Zero-Trust interoperability to Sui , and unlocking unprecedented possibilities for developers, institutions, and individual users alike.” With Ika now live, blockchain projects, financial institutions, and developers can deploy multi-chain applications on Sui, operate as network participants, or engage with the Ika network. For further information, users can visit https://ika.xyz or follow Ika on X. As the premier choice for interoperability, decentralized custody, and chain abstraction, Ika is set to revolutionize digital asset security and multi-chain DeFi.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the fast-paced realm of digital assets, seamless and secure transactions are paramount. IKA is poised to revolutionize our experience with cryptocurrency, introducing a solution that surmounts conventional barriers in cross-chain operations. This post delves into the potential transformative effects of IKA's Zero Trust Multi-Party Computation (MPC) protocol and decentralized wallet (dWallet) technology on fintech in Asia, compliance for SMEs in Europe, and the future of crypto payroll systems for startups. IKA is breaking new ground in the crypto domain with its innovative Zero Trust MPC protocol and dWallet tech. It allows for secure, real-time cross-chain interactions without wrapping tokens or depending on trusted intermediaries. By letting users utilize native assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) across various blockchains, IKA addresses the issues traditional interoperability solutions face.
