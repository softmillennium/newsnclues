                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Denis Shapovalov will ride into his hometown tournament with plenty of confidence. 29 bounced back from sluggish performances on the clay and grass courts in Europe by making it to the final in Los Cabos two weeks ago. Shapovalov eventually fell to Aleksandar Kovacevic in the final, but it was an encouraging sign that the Canadian shot-maker was back in his comfort zone on the hard courts of North America. ‚ÄúEl Shapo‚Äù won a title on the hard courts of Dallas earlier this year and then followed that with an impressive run to the semifinals in Acapulco. But there's something about coming home that doesn't sit quite right with the Toronto native. There's never been a question about Shapovalov's talent, but he tends to unravel quickly when things get away from him on court, and that pressure only becomes more pronounced when he's playing in front of his hometown fans. Shapovalov's tendency to spiral makes him a tough player to back as a chunky favorite, which is where he stands for Tuesday's match against rising American talent Learner Tien, who has four wins in five matches since Wimbledon. Tien's game is growing, and he should be able to give Shapovalov enough problems to warrant a bet Tuesday. Michael Leboff is a long-suffering Islanders fan, but a long-profiting sports bettor with 10 years of experience in the gambling industry. He loves using game theory to help punters win bracket pools, find long shots, and learn how to beat the market in mainstream and niche sports.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Things could have turned out so differently this year for Grigor Dimitrov, who has just been dealt another disappointing blow. The Bulgarian veteran was set to cause a huge shock at Wimbledon after winning the first two sets of his match with  Jannik Sinner, before disaster struck. Immediately, he winced in pain before going down on the turf. You can check out at any time. He was then forced to watch from afar as Sinner went on to win the Grand Slam, beating Carlos Alcaraz in the final. Dimitrov has now been forced to withdraw from next month's US Open. Not only is the world No.20 being forced to miss Flushing Meadows, where he made the semi-final in 2019, but his remarkable Grand Slam run is also over. Dimitrov has made 58 consecutive appearances at majors, a record that dates back to the 2011 Australian Open. It's a stat that no current player on the ATP Tour can match. Dimitrov also now faces a race against time to play at the Shanghai Masters, which begins on September 25. After his injury against Sinner, Dimitrov posted a photo on social media from his hospital bed, and vowed to come back. ‚ÄúThank you for the overwhelming wave of love, your messages have genuinely lifted me through these hard times.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Following his visit to south London, Alcaraz confirmed he would miss the Canadian Open. It is the only Masters 1000 final he has lost in eight appearances. On Monday, the Spaniard was spotted training at the La Manga Club Resort in Spain, where he was working on two specific areas of his game in preparation for Cincinnati. The Spaniard has demonstrated extensive consistency on both groundstrokes, a competent serve, and an ability to mix in an effective drop-shot when required.. German Abril, a Spanish sports journalist, spotted Alcaraz at the La Manga Club Resort in Spain, revealing that the 22-year-old French Open champion was working on his net approaches and passing shots. üéæ Completado un nuevo d√≠a de entrenamientos para Carlos Alcaraz en La Manga Club, hoy haciendo especial √©nfasis en las subidas a la red y passings. On X [Twitter], Abril said: ‚ÄúCompleted another day of training for Carlos Alcaraz at La Manga Club, today with a special focus on net approaches and passing shots.‚Äù With an additional rest period following his withdrawal in Canada, Alcaraz will be well-rested and rejuvenated when taking a shot at claiming his first Cincinnati Open title. It may be somewhat surprising to see Alcaraz working on his net approaches when considering his strong performances at the net during the French Open and Wimbledon finals. However, this is the life of a professional tennis player. As per Wimbledon's match statistics, Alcaraz won 17 of his 23 net points during his 2025 Wimbledon final loss to Jannik Sinner: a percentage of 74. As per the French Open statistics, Alcaraz won 22 of his 33 points against Sinner in the 2025 French Open final: a percentage of 67.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Paula Badosa will now partner Jack Draper for the US Open mixed doubles after her reported split from Stefanos Tsitsipas An updated entry list was unveiled on July 22, with Tsitsipas and Badosa one of two pairs to quietly pull out. British No.1 Jack Draper and Qinwen Zheng were also no longer on the list, with both players suffering from recent injuries. However, it has now been confirmed that Draper and Badosa will unite for a blockbuster partnership at the newly revamped mixed doubles event. The popular duo, often nicknamed 'Tsitsidosa', were reported to have split up during Wimbledon. However, only a day after both of them were beaten in the opening round at Wimbledon, reports of a break-up swirled. HOLA.com said that sources have confirmed their split, with one saying: "The break-up just happened. There was no official confirmation of why they pulled out, but both players remain on the singles entry list. Tsitsipas has a poor record at major tournaments this year heading into the US Open, only winning once in 2025. The Greek star was openly criticised by his coach at SW19 and he will want a major improvement at Flushing Meadows. It will be all eyes on the singles for both stars now, following their withdrawal from the doubles competition. The US Open Mixed Doubles Championship will be staged across two days in New York City, beginning on August 19.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Madison Keys is set to kick off her North American hard-court swing at the 2025 Canadian Open. The American, seeded sixth, received a bye into the second round, where she will take on World No. Keys began the season on a high, claiming titles in Adelaide and winning her first Major title at the Australian Open. She followed that up with a semifinal run at Indian Wells. Although she hasn't lifted a trophy since Melbourne, she has continued to post strong results, including quarterfinal appearances in Madrid and Roland Garros, along with a semifinal finish at the Queen's Club Championships in London. She battled past Elena-Gabriela Ruse 6-7(7), 7-5, 7-5, and defeated Olga Daniloviƒá 6-4, 6-2 to reach the third round, only to be ousted by Siegemund 6-3, 6-3. Having skipped the Mubadala Citi DC Open, Keys will now be looking to avenge that Wimbledon loss when she meets Siegemund again in the second round of the Canadian Open. But the German has had a starkly contrasting singles run in 2025, marred by a series of early exits. She couldn't even make it past the qualifying rounds in Adelaide, Doha, Indian Wells, Miami, and Madrid. Her grass-court season began no better, with opening-round losses in Nottingham and Bad Homburg, but turned the tide at Wimbledon, her most recent tournament. Siegemund, too, will begin her North American hard-court swing in Canada, eyeing momentum in her road to the US Open. The Canadian Open sets up a second consecutive showdown between Keys and Siegemund this season, with the German holding a 2-1 lead in their head-to-head.

Keys, who holds a respectable 32-10 win-loss record this season, will aim to back up her powerful serve with sharper form when she faces Siegemund in the second round. Keys has been more efficient on serve this season, winning 67.8% of her first-serve points and converting 75% of her service games. Adding to Keys' advantage is her overall win percentage of 63.2% on hard courts, which is quite ahead of the German's 50.9%.

The 45-year-old Williams, who returned to the tennis tour last week after more than a year away, and Opelka were among the 14 teams announced Tuesday by the U.S. Tennis Association for its mixed doubles event on Aug. 19-20. Eight of the pairings received direct entry into the field based on having the highest combined current singles rankings, and six were given wild cards by the USTA.

The eight duos with direct entry are No. 9 Holger Rune; Belinda Bencic and No. Badosa originally had sought a place in the field with Stefanos Tsitsipas, while Draper initially was going to play alongside Zheng Qinwen. In addition to Williams-Opelka, the wild-card entrants are Emma Raducanu and No. 12 Frances Tiafoe; Olga Danilovic and No. 6 Novak Djokovic; Taylor Townsend ‚Äî who made her debut at No. 1 in women's doubles this week ‚Äî and No. 7 Ben Shelton; and last year's U.S. Open mixed doubles champions, Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori. It's a group of star players that stands in stark contrast to the sort of lesser-known players and doubles specialists usually found in the mixed doubles bracket at a Grand Slam tournament. Some players were critical of the planned changes when they were announced in February, and Errani and Vavassori called the new setup a ‚Äúpseudo-exhibition focused only on entertainment and show‚Äù that would shut out true doubles players. A total of 16 duos will be competing for the $1 million top prize; the last two wild-card pairs will be announced by the USTA later. It is still possible that Williams will ask for, and receive, a wild-card entry for singles. Those are expected to be announced by the USTA the week of Aug. 11. She won one match each in singles and doubles at the D.C. Open in Washington last week after not competing anywhere since the Miami Open in March 2024. Williams owns seven Grand Slam titles in singles, 14 in women's doubles ‚Äî all won with her younger sister Serena ‚Äî and two in mixed doubles. The 6-foot-11 (2.11-meter) Opelka is a 27-year-old American who used to be ranked in the top 20 and is now No. 74 after missing nearly two full seasons because of injuries.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Earlier this month, it was reported that Wimbledon would generate ‚Äúmore than half a billion dollars in revenue‚Äù for the 2025 edition. It becomes evident from the fact that last year's event pulled in an estimated $555 million. With the nearly 150-year-old tournament becoming a force to reckon with, it was obvious for the organizers to consider expansion. And the massive plan, amounting to $270 million, finally got a much-needed green light to set things in motion. However, it seems like the future dream will come at a cost. Speaking of which, a renowned figure has now expressed his unfiltered thoughts. Wimbledon's huge expansion plan was first revealed several years ago. Interestingly, the expansion aims to triple Wimbledon's footprint. Not to mention the construction of 39 new courts. So far, they have taken place in South London at Roehampton. But, the potential expansion has become a subject of scrutiny, with opposition rallying strong through the Save Wimbledon Park campaign. Sharing his views on the expansion project, insider Jon Wertheim made his stance very clear on Andy Roddick's Served podcast. He began, ‚ÄúI am kind of fascinated by this whole topic. But for a while, one of my takes on Wimbledon was, ‚ÄòHow much money they passed up and they didn't get into the naming rights game and they didn't have so many sponsors, and you don't see the back walls plastered.' I mean this event is going to absolutely change.‚Äù Additionally, he also pointed out the timeline regarding the project's completion. Wimbledon ‚Äì Flight over the famous Tennis courts ‚Äì aerial view over the Tennis courts ‚Äì LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM ‚Äì MAY 27, 2024 Wimbledon ‚Äì Flight over the famous Tennis courts ‚Äì aerial view over the Tennis courts ‚Äì LONDON, ENGLAND ‚Äì MAY 27, 2024 LicenseRF 21740056 Copyright: xZoonar.com/√ärikxLattweinx 21740056 ‚ÄúOne of these bucket list experiences but it's pretty crowded. If this (expansion) creates more opportunities for people to enjoy Wimbledon. And I think Wimbledon's going to lurch significantly ahead now.‚Äù On top of that, this time, Wimbledon experienced its hottest ever-star. Spectators who were camping outside felt a need for seeking a shade and were constantly reaching for water bottles. Wertheim mentioned, ‚ÄúI mean not just in terms of square footage but also just amenities now and the hospitality picture will change and the fact that the qualifying rounds will be on site will turn this into a three-week event the way US Open is. Wertheim knows it will be a huge challenge ‚Äúfor the neighbors who are very unhappy about this.‚Äù For the next few years, ‚Äúthey're going to have dump trucks outside their house for the next five years.‚Äù However, there's the other side too. Not just for balance sheets but the average fan will now have a lot more opportunity to experience Wimbledon. Wertheim commended the Wimbledon's magic that still captivates millions of fans. the 2025 grass major had its fair share of controversial moments too. For the uninitiated, this year's edition saw no actual line judges. While it was expected to alleviate human errors, the results weren't that positive to say the least. For example, during the QF encounter between Taylor Fritz and Karen Khachanov, a call was made mid-point. Later, the event came up with a statement on this blunder. During the press conference, she didn't mince her words. It's kind of, you know, disappointing, you know, the tournament here that the calls can be so wrong, but you know, for the most part, they've been okay,‚Äù she said. Her frustration was due to a call made midway in the first set. Emma Raducanu even approached the chair umpire saying, ‚ÄúYou saw it out as well, right?‚Äù It will be interesting to see how the ELC evolves going forward. Do you think it will get better by the next edition to offer ‚Äúmaximum accuracy‚Äù?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek has weighed in on Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner's differing approaches to the sport. Fellow Wimbledon champ Sinner can relate after declaring that ‚Äúhard work beats talent‚Äù following his victory at SW19. However, Swiatek has confessed to taking inspiration from Alcaraz's more laid-back approach and commitment to enjoying his time away from the tennis court. ‚ÄúHe always says that the most important thing for him on a tennis court is to enjoy it and have fun and I sometimes forget about that. ‚ÄúAnd sometimes with all the pressure around and things we need to do off the court, you need to remind yourself about this kid that started playing tennis, instead of winning for somebody and having this baggage on your shoulders. ‚ÄúFor sure, when Carlos shows that and when he speaks about that, it is always a good reminder for me, and I try to do that as well, but without me working on it, I think my mind would automatically go to just working, working, working." Alcaraz notably embarked on a short trip to Ibiza in June after defeating Sinner in their unforgettable French Open final. While other top players would not consider taking a holiday at such a crucial time in the tennis calendar, it had been Alcaraz's preparation ahead of his two previous Wimbledon wins. This year, he won Queen's upon his return and reached the Wimbledon final. Sinner adopts a more focused approach than his rival. When asked about the secret behind his success after claiming his fourth Grand Slam title, Sinner said: "I always say that hard work beats talent. If you cannot do it in practice sessions, then you cannot do it in the real matches." Meanwhile, Swiatek is focused on extending her success at the Canadian Open as she prepares to face Guo Hanyu in the second round on Wednesday. The 24-year-old has had time to reflect on her Wimbledon win and how it compares to her previous triumphs. ‚ÄúI didn't feel the relief as I did at Roland Garros because everyone was expecting me to win. I thought that tennis can still surprise me and it was all so refreshing. That's why I'm super happy because it wasn't on my list this year to win Wimbledon and it happened.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iga Swiatek is returning to action for the first time following her triumph at Wimbledon. While speaking at her pre-tournament press conference in Montreal, Canada, Swiatek was asked to consider how much of a turning point her Wimbledon victory was in the grand scheme of her career. ‚ÄúSo I would say for sure, I can take a lot from it in terms of like believing and also kind of not giving up because tennis can always surprise you if something positive, if you work hard enough. ‚ÄúSo, yeah, I have these kind of lessons in my mind, but I wouldn't call it like a turning point, you know. It's just another experience that you use in the future.‚Äù If she comes through that contest, Swiatek could set up a meeting with Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, who defeated Sonay Kartal at Wimbledon. Swiatek has a huge opportunity to chase down those above her in the rankings: Coco Gauff and Aryna Sabalenka. The Pole did not compete at the Canadian Open in 2024 due to fatigue, meaning she will be able to gain a significant number of WTA points if she goes far at this week's event. Coco Gauff is in a similar, but not quite as precarious, situation. Therefore, Gauff will likely have an opportunity to gain ground on Sabalenka. However, if she suffers another early shock in Canada, Iga Swiatek will have the opportunity to capitalise.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>His natural high-octane game built around a massive serve, heavy firepower from the ground and ability to finish at net give him capabilities of which most players can only dream. And if you can, what is the opportunity cost? 26 Australian as he enters perhaps the most critical part of his season. This time last year he bolted like a 50-1 Kentucky Derby outsider to win the ATP Masters 1000 title in Montreal and soon after stunned Novak Djokovic on Arthur Ashe Stadium in the third round of the US Open. 1, who leads their Lexus ATP Head2Head series 4-1, is seeded to meet Popyrin in the third round of the National Bank Open in Toronto. ‚ÄúHe has great potential, like we saw in Montreal last year when his game was on fire. In matches where he doesn't miss it gets tricky. He can slice well and prepare for the strong forehand. But there have been matches when he misses a lot so you try to hang in there and try to win the match. Right now he can be too up and down." Popyrin, 25, is unlikely to dispute that frank assessment. Last week in Washington, Popyrin slipped to a 12-16 season record after his ninth opening-round loss of the year. While surely willing himself to a big run in Toronto, Popyrin will be mindful that his dream of a successful title defence starts with consistent performances in the early rounds. Winning the Masters was easily a bigger buzz than the US Open win over Novak because I put together six matches consecutively against Top 20 opponents and beat them all. ‚ÄúAs you look for that consistency, you don't want to take away anything from your big explosive game; it's more about staying in rallies longer and waiting for the right opportunity rather than going for an unbelievable shot.‚Äù One year on from his Montreal title, the bill has come due. But for a calendar shift related to Toronto's move to an expanded 12-day event, Popyrin would already have dropped his 1000 champion's points and be just outside the Top 50 of the PIF ATP Live Rankings. ‚ÄúEvery year you have to go in defending points. This year is just a big chunk of points that go out because of an amazing result that happened the year before‚Ä¶ Going into Toronto, I'm trying to not put too much pressure on myself and I know that once those points are off, I'll have like a little bit of a weight lifted off my shoulders.‚Äù Coaches Neville Godwin and Wayne Ferreira (who joined the team in April) have helped the three-time ATP Tour champion realise that he doesn't need to force his way out of defence with one shot. His fellow Australian Alex de Minaur, known as one of the game's elite movers, said Popyrin's court coverage was highly underrated. ‚ÄúFor a big, tall guy Pop's movement is extremely good,‚Äù the recent Washington ATP 500 champion told ATPTour.com. ‚ÄúSo he's got the ability to play a big brand of tennis and go after shots on his terms, but he's also got the ability to retrieve and defend with his legs, giving his opponents something else to think about.‚Äù Popyrin was chuffed to hear De Minaur's praise when ATPTour.com sat down with him in Washington. I definitely see it as a weapon of mine.‚Äù Leading into the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters in April, Popyrin onboarded former World No. 6 Ferreira, who replaced Xavier Malisse in the dual coach setup with fellow South African Godwin. ‚ÄúI like to get the same message from both coaches. ‚ÄúI've had the dual coach set up for a while. Neville worked with Xavier Malisse for two years before and we went from being ranked 120 to Top 20, basically. Since Wayne came in, I feel like my year has been trending upwards. But we were able to get over that hurdle.‚Äù Off the court, Popyrin also feels he is on an upward trajectory as he looks ahead to his wedding to fiance Amy Pederick. The city and venue have been decided, but for now, they remain a secret. ‚ÄúI've left all the planning to her,‚Äù he said. We're going to get married next year around September time. Popyrin begins his title defence Tuesday in Toronto third match from 11 a.m. against 18-year-old Canadian wild card Nicolas Arseneault, who is making his main-draw Tour-level debut.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Corentin Moutet and Jenson Brooksby will wrap up first-round action at the Toronto Masters on Tuesday. Most of the order of play features the second round, in which Holger Rune faces Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard.Corentin Moutet vs. (PR) Jenson BrooksbyMoutet is positively surging right now. The 46th-ranked Frenchman finished runner-up on the grass courts of Mallorca and is coming off a semifinal result in Washington, D.C. He has advanced at least one round in seven consecutive main-draw appearances at the ATP level, last losing an opening match at the Madrid Masters in late April. Up first for Moutet at the National Bank Open on Tuesday is Brooksby, whom he has never faced. The 102nd-ranked American also posted a runner-up finish on grass (Eastbourne), so he should be playing with some confidence despite losing right away in Washington, D.C. at the hands of Yoshihito Nishioka. This should be a fascinating matchup between two guys who don't possess a ton of firepower but can do all kinds of unique things with the tennis ball. He lost in the quarterfinals to Roberto Bautista Agut and then squandered a two-set lead over Nicolas Jarry at Wimbledon. A bad draw against Mpetshi Perricard may add to Rune's woes. The 6'8‚Äù Frenchman already has a match under his belt this week, having defeated Shintaro Mochizuki 6-4, 6-2 on Sunday. Mochizuki may not be the toughest of opponents, but breaking serve three times against anyone is encouraging for Mpetshi Perricard. Rune cannot be trusted given his lack of form and potential physical issues, so an upset for the world No. Normally, maybe some possible fatigue from Moutet would be a factor, but this is Moutet we are talking about, far from your average player, his lefty game looks to cause Brooksby enough problems to go through, also leftiness helps mitigate fatigue, Moutet in 3, 1-6, 6-1, 7-6(9). Correction Rune did not play Washington due to back pain, not an injury, though yes there are questions over how his back is feeling now, though it seems he's fine enough since he's playing, MP blasting serves at him all day in the blazing hot sun will likely test it well, Rune has only played one match since Queen's at Wimby, MP got him last year in Basel indoors, so MP has that going for him even though his overall form lately has been poor, MP in 3, 4-6, 7-6(1), 7-6(8). Brooksby in three for the tiredness reason. I had Rune , but on reflection, Perricard in three, slightly more faith in him which isn't much Your email address will not be published.</p>
