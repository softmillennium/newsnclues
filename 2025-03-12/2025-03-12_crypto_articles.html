Ripple said on Thursday that it had received approval from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) to provide regulated crypto payments and services in the UAE, becoming the first blockchain-enabled payments provider licensed by the agency.

“We are entering an unprecedented period of growth for the crypto industry, driven by greater regulatory clarity around the world and increasing institutional adoption,” said Brad Garlinghouse, chief executive officer of Ripple, in a release.

“Thanks to its early leadership in creating a supportive environment for tech and crypto innovation, the UAE is exceptionally well-placed to benefit.”

Ripple said it has seen increasing demand across the Middle East from crypto-native firms and traditional financial institutions, and has around 20% of its global customer base already operating in the Middle East.

Payments utility is also expected to drive greater stablecoin adoption in the UAE, with stablecoins offering real time settlements. That can drive further growth for Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin — which stands at a $134 million capitalization as of Thursday (meaning an equivalent amount in USD backing).

Ripple’s DFSA license adds to its growing list of over 60 regulatory approvals worldwide, including a Major Payments Institution license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), a New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) Trust Charter, a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) registration from the Central Bank of Ireland, and Money Transmitter Licenses (MTLs) across multiple U.S. states.

XRP prices are up nearly 4% in the past 24 hours, beating gains in bitcoin (BTC), as the long-running Ripple vs SEC court case is reportedly reaching its final settlement stages.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A revision to NASCAR’s Open Exemption Provisional rules says the OEP won’t be implemented if there are 40 or fewer vehicles qualifying for an event.

In announcing the change Wednesday afternoon, NASCAR said a requested and approved OEP would be activated automatically “if more than 40 vehicles qualify for the event.”

With the use of the OEP, the field size will increase to 41. The OEP vehicle will start in the position in which the driver qualified, but it won’t be eligible for points or prize money.

Under the revision, if there are 40 or less vehicles entered in the event, the OEP will not be activated, and the vehicle will be eligible for points and prize money.

The OEP was used by Trackhouse Racing to guarantee four-time Indianapolis 500 winner Helio Castroneves entrance into the Daytona 500 field. He started last and wasn’t eligible for points and prize money.

Prior to the start of the 2025 season, NASCAR officials said they would review the OEP rules after Daytona.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Rumble (NASDAQ: RUM), the video-sharing platform and cloud services provider, has announced the purchase of approximately 188 Bitcoin, valued at around $17.1 million, as part of its previously disclosed Bitcoin treasury strategy. Acquired at an average price of approximately $91,000 per coin, this purchase is a part of the company’s plan to allocate up to $20 million into Bitcoin.

“We are excited to announce these purchases and allocation of Bitcoin as part of our treasury strategy as well as a larger strategic move as we further expand our ties to the crypto industry,” said Rumble Chairman and CEO Chris Pavlovski. “These holdings have the potential to serve as a valuable hedge against inflation and will not be subject to dilution like so many overprinted government-issued currencies. As a leading video and cloud services platform for the crypto community, we are proud to officially hold Bitcoin as we continue to grow and engrain crypto into our company’s DNA.”

The announcement follows Rumble’s previously disclosed corporate treasury diversification strategy, which was approved by its Board of Directors. The strategy aims to leverage Bitcoin as a strategic asset to accelerate the company’s expansion into digital assets while strengthening its financial position.

“We believe that the world is still in the early stages of the adoption of Bitcoin, which has recently accelerated with the election of a crypto-friendly U.S. presidential administration and increased institutional adoption,” Pavlovski stated. “Unlike any government-issued currency, Bitcoin is not subject to dilution through endless money-printing, enabling it to be a valuable inflation hedge and an excellent addition to our treasury. We are also excited to strengthen our ties with crypto and to bolster our efforts to become the leading video and cloud services platform for the crypto community.”

The company noted that the actual timing and value of any future Bitcoin acquisitions will depend on various factors, including general market conditions, Bitcoin’s trading price, and Rumble’s anticipated cash needs. Rumble stated their strategy will remain flexible and may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time based on the company’s discretion.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Компания Hemi, основанная одним из первых разработчиков Bitcoin Джеффом Гарзиком, планирует объединить Bitcoin и Ethereum, два старейших и крупнейших блокчейна, в «единую суперсеть», говорится в сообщении, отправленном по электронной почте.

Hemi создан на основе Bitcoin и Ethereum , чтобы объединить лучшие качества обоих, используя безопасность Bitcoin и программируемость Ethereum. Проект Привлечено 15 миллионов долларов в ходе раунда финансирования под руководством Binance Labsв сентябре прошлого года.

Однако кодирование Bitcoin не позволяет изначально реализовывать некоторые функции, необходимые DeFi, такие как смарт-контракты или доказательства с нулевым разглашением, поэтому возникла необходимость в создании моста между этой утилитой и Ethereum.

Компания подписала десятки протоколов для развертывания на Hemi, включая децентрализованную биржу (DEX) SUSHI, ликвидный токен для стейкинга pumpBTC и оракулы RedStone и PYTH.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Hemi, founded by early Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik, plans to unify Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two oldest and largest blockchains, into "a single supernetwork," according to an emailed announcement.

Hemi is built on both Bitcoin and Ethereum to combine the best qualities of both, taking advantage of Bitcoin's security and Ethereum's programmability. The project raised $15 million in a funding round led by Binance Labs last September.

The project is one of several looking to transform the broader blockchain landscape, particularly with regard to decentralized finance (DeFi), through combining Bitcoin and Ethereum due in part to the deep stores of value held in bitcoin (BTC), which comfortably exceed those of every other digital asset combined.

However, Bitcoin's coding lacks the ability to natively build some of the functions that DeFi requires, such as smart contracts or zero-knowledge proofs, hence the need to bridge this utility from Ethereum.

The company has signed up dozens of protocols for deployment on Hemi, including decentralized exchange (DEX) Sushi, liquid staking token pumpBTC and oracles RedStone and Pyth.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Bolivia's state energy company YBFB will use cryptocurrency to pay for energy imports, according to a Reuters report.

YBFB hopes that using crypto will be a direct solution to the nation's shortage in U.S. dollars and foreign currency reserves.

The shortage comes alongside a fuel crisis spurred by a lack of natural gas exports, which had led to scattered protests across the country, the report said.

"From now on, these (cryptocurrency) transactions will be carried out," a YPFB spokesperson told Reuters.

This is not the first time a South American state-owned energy firm has moved into crypto; in 2023 Agentina's YPF announced that it was moving into crypto mining, and last April Venezuela's PDVSA revealed that it was using cryptocurrencies to combat U.S. imposed oil sanctions.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Crypto exchange OKX Europe has acquired a Malta-licensed firm with a Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II) license, bringing it a step closer to offering regulated derivatives products throughout Europe, the firm said in a statement on Wednesday.

The entity is expected to become operational later this year, once the exchange gets approval from the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA). The exchange did not say which firm it acquired.

With its MiFID II license, OKX will be able to provide regulated derivatives products and services to its institutional clients in the European Economic Area, which includes 27 European Union member states as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.

This is another step solidifying the third-largest exchange in terms of market cap in the EU, the release said. It attained a Markets in Crypto Assets license from Malta in January.
