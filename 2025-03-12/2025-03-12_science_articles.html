Even during one of Earth's largest mass extinction events, where heat waves kill of a majority of Earth's species, at least one oasis of survival existed.

The findings suggest that there may have been pockets of protection throughout Earth — challenging the notion that the heat affected life on the planet uniformly, according to a paper in Science Advances.

About 250 million years ago, a series of massive volcanic eruptions warmed Earth. This period, sometimes referred to as “The Great Dying”, was aptly named. It killed off about 95 percent of marine species and 75 percent of land-locked lifeforms, although some species appeared clever enough to find ways to beat the heat. 

The researchers found an abundance of plant fossils dating back to that time in China's Turpan-Hami Basin. The implication? Even though the region was relatively close to some volcanic activity, it somehow shielded a wide variety of plants.

"This suggests that local climate and geographic factors can create surprising pockets of resilience, offering hope for conservation efforts in the face of global environmental change," Liu Feng, a paleontology researcher with the Chinese Academy of Science and an author of the paper, said in a press release. 

The fossils the team found pointed to a widely diverse plant community that survived the initial destructive events. Those fossils indicate both resilience that allowed them to bounce back from the volcanic events, as well as the evolutionary ability they needed to adapt afterward.

The team's findings suggest that some land areas were shielded from the worst effects of extinction, creating pockets of resilience that played a crucial role in the rebound of life on Earth. The researchers cited the region's stable, semi-humid climate as essential to the area's ability to continuously support life. The scientists analyzed layers of soil in the area and determined that it received fairly consistent rainfall during the mass extinction period.

The findings challenge one prevailing theory about the Permian mass extinction event. That theory claims that volcanic eruptions in Siberia triggered wildfires, acid rain, and toxic gases, which indiscriminately killed off much of the life on Earth. The opposing view argues that these events differed around the globe, due to differences in atmosphere, latitude, and perhaps geography.

The new findings tilt the scale toward the “variable effects” side. Evidence includes fossil records of fern fields and coniferous forests that existed 160,000 years before the extinction and persisted 160,000 years after it was over. The fossils include intact tree trunks and fern stems, which lend credence to the notion that this was local vegetation, not transported by wind or other elements.

The scientists did detect SOME extinction in the area during that time period, but at 21 percent it was far lower than at much of the rest of the planet. Because the plant oasis persisted, it presented a welcome place for animals to thrive after the event ended. The team found some animal fossils dating to about 75,000 years after the extinction.

The discovery of this “life oasis” shows incredible resiliency and suggests that, with the right conditions, plants and animals can persist following major disasters.

	There's no clear quantum advantage yet in tests of real-world problems

A D-Wave quantum computer equipped with a quantum annealing processor (shown) tackled a real-world problem that would stymie a classical supercomputer, researchers claim.

The tug-of-war between quantum computers and classical computers is intensifying.

In just minutes, a special quantum processor, called a quantum annealing processor, solved a complex real-world problem that a classical supercomputer would take millions of years to complete, researchers claim March 12 in Science. And that supercomputer, the team reports, would consume more energy to run the whole computation than the entire globe uses in a year. However, another group of researchers claims to have already found a way for a classical supercomputer to solve a subset of the same problem in just over two hours.

Quantum computers leverage principles of quantum mechanics to potentially offer huge advantages in processing power and speed compared with the classical computers we're familiar with in our daily lives. This capability theoretically allows quantum computers to tackle problems much faster than classical computers can.

The new, conflicting results follow similar claims made in recent years. The nascent field of quantum computing has been advancing in lockstep with techniques to make supercomputers more efficient, resulting in a closely matched rivalry. While quantum computers have demonstrated the ability to solve truly random problems faster than classical computers, they have yet to come out on top for physical problems relevant to real-world systems.

In the latest match-up, researchers at D-Wave Quantum Inc. in Burnaby, Canada, used a quantum computer equipped with a quantum annealing processor. Annealing processors differ from other, more typical quantum processors and have shown promise in conducting specific tasks. These processors are better equipped to tackle large problems because their quantum bits, or qubits, are coupled to many other qubits instead of just one, as in other types of quantum processors. But they are useful only for specific types of problems, such as optimization problems, and D-Wave's computers have attracted scientific skepticism in the past.

For the new result, the D-Wave researchers used a quantum annealing processor to simulate quantum dynamics by using arrays of magnetized disordered pieces known as spin glasses. This setup is relevant to materials science, where understanding the evolution of such systems can help in designing new metals.

“This is a simulation of magnetic materials,” says Mohammad Amin, chief scientist at D-Wave. “Magnetic materials are very important in industry and daily life,” appearing in devices such as cell phones, hard drives and specialized medical sensors.

The researchers simulated the evolution of such systems in two, three and infinite dimensions. After trying to solve the problem with approximations on a supercomputer, they concluded that it couldn't be done within a reasonable timeframe.

“It's a milestone result in quantum computing,” says Andrew King, a quantum computer scientist at D-Wave. “We've demonstrated quantum supremacy for the first time on an actual problem of real interest.”

Physicist Daniel Lidar, director of the quantum computing center at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, agrees that the D-Wave team hit a milestone. “It's very impressive work,” says Lidar, who was not involved in either study but works with a D-Wave device. “They really managed to perform quantum simulations on their hardware that are beyond the reach of current classical methods.”

But the claim isn't without controversy. King and his colleagues posted a preliminary draft of their paper about a year ago on arXiv.org, providing another group of researchers the opportunity to scrutinize the findings.

Quantum computer scientist Joseph Tindall of the Flatiron Institute in New York City and colleagues simulated part of the same problem using a classical computer. They developed a method that repurposed a 40-year-old algorithm called belief propagation, commonly used in artificial intelligence. Their results, submitted to arXiv.org on March 7 but not yet peer-reviewed, claim to be more accurate than the quantum computer's for certain cases of the two- and three-dimensional systems.

“For the … spin glass problem at hand, our classical approach demonstrably outperforms other reported methods,” the group writes in a draft of their study. “In [two cases] we are also able to reach errors noticeably lower than the quantum annealing approach employed by the D-Wave Advantage2 system.”

The classical simulations focused on only a subset of the D-Wave results, and the two groups are at odds as to whether the classical simulations can reproduce all the abilities of the quantum computer simulations, particularly for the three-dimensional system.

However, the quantum computer indisputably excelled with the infinite-dimensional system. Although not strictly physical, this system is useful for improving artificial intelligence. Simulating it classically would require an entirely different approach compared with the methods used for the two- and three-dimensional systems, Lidar says. Whether that can be done remains an open question.

	The face fossils date to as early as 1.4 million years ago

Reassembled upper jaw and cheek fossils found in a Spanish cave come from the oldest known human ancestors in Western Europe. Researchers date this facial find to between 1.4 million and 1.1 million years ago.

By Bruce Bower

2 hours ago

A Spanish cave has divulged the oldest known fossil remains of human ancestors in Western Europe.

Excavations at a site known as Sima del Elefante produced several fossil fragments that, when pieced together, form a partial left upper jaw and cheek bone dated to between 1.4 million and 1.1 million years old, say zooarchaeologist Rosa Huguet of the Catalan Institute of Human Paleoecology and Social Evolution in Tarragona, Spain, and colleagues.

That ancient midface comes from a previously unknown European Homo population, the researchers report March 12 in Nature.

“This discovery introduces a new actor in the story of human evolution in Europe,” Huguet said at a March 11 press briefing.

Some features of the jaw and cheek resemble those of Homo erectus individuals who reached a site called Dmanisi, in what's now the Southwest Asian nation of Georgia, around 1.8 million years ago. But not enough evidence exists to determine whether the new find qualifies as H. erectus or as a separate species, the investigators say.

Huguet's team digitally scanned each fossil fragment to create a virtual, 3-D version of the entire ancient midface. A mirror image of the reassembled left-side fossils was used to portray the right side of the virtual midface.

A lower jaw fossil previously unearthed at Sima del Elefante dates to between roughly 1.2 million to 1.1 million years ago and may have belonged to the same unnamed Homo species as the facial fossil, they suggest.

Hominid fossils excavated over the past 30 years at Gran Dolina, a cave located near Sima del Elefante, come from a species Huguet's group calls Homo antecessor, which lived between roughly 900,000 and 800,000 years ago. Vertically oriented, flat cheek bones of H. antecessor resemble those of people today, unlike the older Sima del Elefante face fossils.

Evolutionary ties between those two ancient European Homo species remain unclear. Members of the Sima del Elefante species — who also left behind a small collection of simple stone cutting or chopping tools — might have survived until shortly after the arrival of H. antecessor, the researchers say. In support of that scenario, animal bones and plant remains excavated in the same sediment as the ancient midface fossils reflect mild temperatures and a setting dotted with meadows, woods, shrubs and streams.

If recent evidence holds up of extreme cold temporarily driving hominid populations out of Europe shortly before 1.1 million years ago, then the Sima del Elefante Homo species may have died out before H. antecessor arrived, the scientists say.

Huguet's group presents a carefully reconstructed midface for one of the oldest known European hominids, says Harvard University biological anthropologist G. Philip Rightmire, who did not participate in the new study. He suspects, though, that the ancient Sima del Elefante crowd belonged to H. erectus.

Fossil remains of four H. erectus faces at Dmanisi display considerable variation in nasal structure and other midface traits, Rightmire says. One of those faces aligns closely with the Spanish midface discovery, he contends. After H. erectus left Africa, “I would put my money on a long-lasting regional [H. erectus] population occupying Dmanisi around 1.8 million years ago, with later populations moving into Europe,” Rightmire says.

Scientists have found ancient nail tooth shark fossils deep inside Mammoth Cave in Kentucky, revealing new information about a mysterious group of extinct predators.

Researchers collecting fossils deep inside Kentucky's Mammoth Cave have uncovered the remains of a never-before-seen species — an absolutely tiny ancient shark with nail-like teeth.

The newfound species is called Clavusodens mcginnisi, or McGinnis' nail tooth. The animal lived 340 million years ago and belonged to a group of sharks known as obruchevodid petalodonts, or "chipmunk sharks" because of their tiny size and unusual teeth.

These sharks grew to just 3 to 4 inches (7.5 to 10 centimeters) long and fed on crustaceans, worms and other prey on the seafloor, according to a statement released by the National Park Service (NPS). It's thought their tiny size helped them avoid large predators while foraging.

Researchers unveiled McGinnis' nail tooth in a study published Jan. 24 in the Journal of Paleontology. The species name is named after David McGinnis, a retired National Park Service superintendent, and their teeth, which resemble old iron nails.

A team of researchers plucked the fossils out of rocks inside Mammoth Cave, the longest cave system in the world. Mammoth Cave is a treasure trove for ancient fish fossils, with more than 70 different species identified within its walls, according to a 2024 study published in the journal Parks Stewardship Forum.

Underground rivers and streams forged the cave's passages, which are made up of rocks that have preserved marine sediment from the Carboniferous period (358.9 million to 298.9 million years ago). The cave has given researchers a unique window inside these rocks, and therefore the marine environments they preserve, according to the 2024 study.

Researchers have been documenting vertebrate fossils in Mammoth Cave since 2019. The work is challenging because of the cave's often cramped conditions and limited space to move equipment in and out.

"Many of these sites have low ceilings requiring crawling for long distances on hands and knees, and at times belly crawling," the researchers wrote in the new study. "The fish fossils are frequently encountered in the cave ceilings or walls."

The newly discovered fossils came out of the Ste. Genevieve rock formation and date back to 330.9 million to 323.2 million years ago. The fossils are the oldest obruchevodid petalodonts discovered so far, according to the study.

Researchers suspect that these ancient sharks may have lived in reef-like systems filled with marine invertebrates called crinoids, or sea lilies, that attached themselves to the sea floor like plants. However, that assessment remains speculative until researchers carry out more studies on the ancient fish and their habitat, according to the study.

Discoveries like McGinnis' nail tooth enable researchers to learn more about long-extinct sharks and the ecosystems they inhabited.

"The fossil discoveries in Mammoth Cave continue to reveal a wealth of new information about ancient shark species," Barclay Trimble, the superintendent at Mammoth Cave National Park, said in the statement. "Researchers and volunteers collected samples from the main Mammoth Cave system and from smaller isolated caves throughout the park that have provided new data on previously known ancient sharks and revealed several species that are brand new to science."

Scientists have found a way to store hundreds of terabytes of data onto a tiny crystal, with plans to scale this up to a disc-sized device that can be compatible with modern computing.

Scientists have devised a way to store and read data from individual atoms embedded in tiny crystals only a few millimeters in size (where 1 mm is 0.04 inches). If scaled up, it could one day lead to ultra-high density storage systems capable of holding petabytes of data on a single disc — where 1 PB is equivalent to approximately 5,000 4K movies.

Encoding data as 1s and 0s is as old as the entire history of computing, with the only difference being the medium used to store this data — moving from vacuum tubes flashing on and off, tiny electronic transistors, or even compact discs (CDs), with pits in the surface representing 1s and smoothness indicating 0.

The hunt is now on for even denser data storage, which is leading scientists to the subatomic world. In a new study published Feb. 14 in the journal Nanophotonics, researchers have used an electron trapped by a defect in a crystal to represent a 1 with the lack of a trapped electron indicating 0.

The work was inspired by quantum techniques, the scientists said. In particular, they integrated solid-state physics applied to radiation dosimetry with a research group working strongly in quantum storage — but this specific work builds classical computing memory.

The technology works by shining a laser with a specific amount of energy that will excite an electron. At this point, a reading device may register the presence of light. No light means no trapped electron.

This only works when the crystals include defects, such as an oxygen vacancy or a foreign impurity. "These defects present very nice characteristics,” first author of the study, Leonardo França, postdoctoral researcher in physics at the University of Chicago, told Live Science. "One of them is the ability to store charge."

Knowing this, the team used rare earth ions as dopants — impurities added to a material to alter its properties — with the key lying in devising a way to excite an electron from a specific rare earth ion so it then becomes trapped. If imagining how a CD works, this would be equivalent to creating a pit.

"We have to provide sufficient energy to release an electron from a rare earth ion and the defect — a nearby defect — will sense that," said França. "So you capture the electron by an intrinsic electric field. This is the writing part."

Then you come to reading the data. "Basically, you have to use another light source so that the electron will be released from the defect," said França. "And that leads to a recombination of charges, and that leads to emission of light."

If the process worked exactly like this, the data would be erased every time it was read, but using lower amounts of light would only "partially erase information," said França. So it would fade over time, in a similar way that data held in tapes fades over 10 to 30 years.

While the team used the rare earth element praseodymium and an yttrium oxide crystal, the work could equally extend to other non-rare earth element crystals with other non-dopants. But rare earth elements have the advantage of providing known and specific wavelengths that enable us to excite electrons using standard lasers.

The researchers' initial aim was to address individual atoms. They haven't yet achieved this goal, but França believes that the technique the team has pioneered puts them on the right track.

Appetite for further research is attributed to how scalable this technology is, potentially ushering in low-cost, high-density storage formats in the future for various applications, França said.

The good news is that the optical, laser side of the equation is already well understood and cheap. Likewise, the crystal would cost little money to produce at scale. That leaves the cost of acquiring the rare earth elements and devising a way to introduce defects using mass manufacturing methods.

—'Quantum CD' could hold up to 1,000 times more data than today's optical disks

—New 'petabit-scale' optical disc can store as much information as 15,000 DVDs

If these obstacles can be overcome, the crystal could be fabricated as a disc, he added, and be read by inexpensive readers. The final question would be around how densely you can store data on a hypothetical disc.

"In our crystal, where we have around 40mm3 [0.002 cubic inches], we could store a few hundred terabytes,” França told Live Science. After performing some calculations, he put the figure at approximately 260 TB.

That figure is based on the crystal the scientists investigated, but França sees a future in which you could easily increase the defect density. This naturally leads to the possibility of PBs of data stored on a single device the size of a disc.

Cancer researchers now believe that targeting the critical energy infrastructure of cancer cells — the mitochondria — may provide a powerful new treatment strategy that overcomes two of the main ways tumors evade destruction.

To kill tumors, doctors use drugs to kill the rogue cells. However, due to the rapid growth of cancer cells and their ability to repair damaged DNA, tumors can quickly develop resistance to these drugs, sometimes spreading throughout the body through a process called metastasis. 

Researchers in China believe that by targeting the mitochondria of cancer cells, both these scenarios could be circumvented.



Mitochondria are specialized structures inside cells that produce the chemical energy required to keep the cell alive and functioning. According to Yanjuan Gu at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, recent studies looking into mitochondria have revealed its potential as a cancer therapy target.

 “Studies revealed that mitochondria lack robust DNA repair mechanisms, making them vulnerable to targeted therapies,” said Gu.

Mitochondria are contained within a specialized double membrane within the cell. In these compartments are the machinery that carries out the energy production as well as a specialized unit of DNA known as mitochondrial DNA. 

One effective treatment against cancer cells is to administer drugs which damage DNA, leading to cell death. But tumors often develop resistance to this because of their DNA repair capability. How veer, the lack of these repair tools in mitochondria prevents this.

Researchers at several institutions found that mitochondria are essential for metastasis — the ability of tumors to spread to other parts of the body. The many mechanisms are still not entirely understood, but changes in tumor cell mitochondria are thought to activate metastasis pathways, where these cancer cell mitochondria can even be transferred to healthy immune cells. This transfer simultaneously suppresses the immune response to the cancer's spread while also facilitating the spread itself.

Based on these findings, Gu and her colleagues hypothesized that by targeting cancer cell mitochondria, they can avoid resistance and prevent or slow metastasis. The challenge, however, is packaging and delivering drugs to the mitochondria.

Any drug targeting tumor mitochondria must enter the cancer cell and then accumulate in the mitochondria — and nowhere else. To do this, drugs are packaged into carriers called exosomes and specific targeting proteins called ligands are attached. Exosomes are membrane-bound structures used by cells to transport various molecules. Ligands line the surface of the exosome and recognize and bind to the membranes of the cancer cells allowing them to get inside.

Unfortunately, finding the right combination of exosome, ligand, and medicine can be difficult because each component can chemically alter the functioning of the other once they are combined into a single structure.



To address these challenges Gu and her team developed a nanoparticle platform consisting of several components, each with a specific job.

Known as OXA@Exo-RD, it is made up of an exosome, a cancer cell-targeting peptide, a mitochondrion-targeting molecule called dequalinium, and the chemotherapy drug oxaliplatin. The chosen exosome is known to be stable when injected into the bloodstream and is not toxic to healthy tissue.

“[The targeting peptide] is one of the most well-known active targeting ligands evaluated preclinically and clinically and holds promise for targeting cancer cells,” explained Gu. The next two target the mitochondria specifically.

Importantly, dequalinium is positively charged, which serves two functions. In cancer cells the difference in charge on either side of the mitochondrial membrane — known as the transmembrane potential — is much higher than normal cells meaning positively charged particles cross easily and accumulate inside.

Dequalinium, therefore, accumulates in the mitochondria, bringing the anticancer drug with it. It is itself also toxic to the mitochondria, and leads to mitochondria failure and cell death. Finally, the drug oxaliplatin binds to the mitochondrial DNA, causing defects and damage. 

Together these components add up to a potent attack on the mitochondria of cancer cells.

To test the nanoparticle treatment, mice with colorectal cancer were treated with OXA@Exo-RD. The team then measured how well the drug entered tumor mitochondria, as well as the reductions in tumor volume and spread from the colon and rectum to the liver.

The results showed that the drug efficiently accumulated in the tumor mitochondria and worked well to reduce tumor size. Compared to control groups, the tumors in mice treated with OXA@Exo-RD were significantly smaller, and when removed and examined, showed the largest amounts of dead cells and necrotic tumor tissue.

Experiments looking at reduced spread of the cancer to the liver found that, compared to control groups receiving saline solution or oxaliplatin on it's own, treatment with the full OXA@Exo-RD nanoparticle reduce the rate of new tumors in the liver up to 86%.



For Gu and the team, these results show that their combination of components making up the nanoparticle are correct. The package was efficiently delivered to the cancer cell mitochondria and worked as expected. But before this treatment becomes commonplace several hurdles remain.

The team needs to evaluate potential side effects to healthy mitochondria and better understand how different tumors will react to the treatment. “Tumor cells exhibit varying mitochondrial membrane potentials,” said Gu, meaning the drug may be less efficient in some cancers. There are also issues with cost, scalability, and regulation.

According to Gu, there are few standardized frameworks for evaluating exosome-based nanodrugs, particularly in terms of immunogenicity and long-term toxicity.

“Regarding cost considerations, the engineered OXA@Exo-RD, as an exosome-based therapy, likely incurs higher upfront costs than conventional chemotherapy due to the complexity of exosome production,” she said. This complexity also reduces the scalability of producing, storing, and transporting the nanoparticles to cancer clinics.

Despite these challenges, “we believe that OXA@Exo-RD represents a promising yet resource-intensive approach for treating chemoresistant cancers,” said Gu. “While current methods, such as conventional chemotherapy, are more accessible, advancements in exosome engineering and manufacturing could help bridge the gap in cost and scalability.”

Using bat poop to fertilize plants like cannabis can sometimes have deadly consequences. A report highlights two fatal cases that affected men in New York.

The patients: A 59-year-old man (patient one) and a 64-year-old man (patient two) in Rochester, New York

The symptoms: Patient one was initially admitted to the hospital for respiratory failure after experiencing various symptoms, including a sore throat, difficulty swallowing and extensive weight loss for about six weeks. At the hospital, doctors ordered a computed tomography (CT) scan of the patient's neck, which revealed that he had mucus clogging his upper voice box and right-side vocal cord.

Patient two, meanwhile, was initially hospitalized for having low salt levels in his blood, which caused tissue swelling. His teeth were also in poor condition, which made it harder for him to eat or drink, leading to weight loss, and he had a chronic cough.

What happened next: When he was admitted to hospital, patient one seemed to be wasting away and had signs of bacterial blood poisoning. An additional CT scan, this time of his chest, showed that he had a buildup of fluid in his lungs. Doctors treated him with antibiotics and briefly put him on ventilation to support his breathing. The medical team later identified traces of fungi in the patient's urine and in coughed-up mucus from his respiratory tract.

In the hospital, patient two had a fever of 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius). A CT scan revealed multiple lesions in his chest and abdomen. In addition, traces of fungi were detected in his urine.

The diagnosis: Both patients — who were not affiliated in any way but were from the same area — were diagnosed with a rare fungal lung infection called histoplasmosis.

This condition occurs when people inhale spores of a harmful fungus named Histoplasma capsulatum, which usually grows in soil and the poop of birds and bats. Approximately 1 to 2 people per 100,000 in the United States are infected with histoplasmosis each year. However, most people exposed to the fungus don't develop any symptoms. Symptoms are more likely to emerge in people with lung conditions or weakened immune systems, compared to the general population.

In these two cases, the patients' symptoms may have been exacerbated by other diseases that they had before they developed histoplasmosis. For example, patient one had emphysema, a common type of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in which air sacs in the lungs are damaged, which constrains breathing.



The pair also smoked tobacco and cannabis.

The treatment: Following their diagnoses, the patients were prescribed antifungal drugs to combat their infections. However, despite this treatment, both died. Between 5% and 7% of patients who are hospitalized with histoplasmosis die of their infection.

What makes the case unique: Both patients in these cases were already using or planning to use bat poop as fertilizer to grow cannabis for personal use. Patient one had ordered bat poop — or guano — online, while patient two intended to use guano he'd found in his attic following a bat infestation.

In a report describing the cases, doctors noted that various online sources claim that bat guano is a "natural superfood" for cannabis plants because it contains lots of nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Meanwhile, numerous U.S. states have recently legalized the recreational use of cannabis — including Arizona in 2020, New York in 2022 and Ohio in 2023 — which may be encouraging more people to grow their own cannabis, the report authors noted.

The dangers of using bat guano as fertilizer aren't unique to cannabis — the product would be risky for any gardening, the authors emphasized. But given guano is being marketed for cannabis specifically, there is a need to raise public awareness around the potential risks associated with using the poop in this way, they warned.
