https://sciencenews.org,Western Europe’s oldest face adds new wrinkles to human evolution,https://www.sciencenews.org/article/western-europe-face-fossil-evolution,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 12:00:00 GMT","A Spanish cave has divulged the oldest known fossil remains of human ancestors in Western Europe.

Excavations at a site known as Sima del Elefante produced several fossil fragments that, when pieced together, form a partial left upper jaw and cheek bone dated to between 1.4 million and 1.1 million years old, say zooarchaeologist Rosa Huguet of the Catalan Institute of Human Paleoecology and Social Evolution in Tarragona, Spain, and colleagues.

That ancient midface comes from a previously unknown European Homo population, the researchers report March 12 in Nature.

“This discovery introduces a new actor in the story of human evolution in Europe,” Huguet said at a March 11 press briefing.

Some features of the jaw and cheek resemble those of Homo erectus individuals who reached a site called Dmanisi, in what’s now the Southwest Asian nation of Georgia, around 1.8 million years ago. But not enough evidence exists to determine whether the new find qualifies as H. erectus or as a separate species, the investigators say.

Huguet’s team digitally scanned each fossil fragment to create a virtual, 3-D version of the entire ancient midface. A mirror image of the reassembled left-side fossils was used to portray the right side of the virtual midface.

A lower jaw fossil previously unearthed at Sima del Elefante dates to between roughly 1.2 million to 1.1 million years ago and may have belonged to the same unnamed Homo species as the facial fossil, they suggest.

Hominid fossils excavated over the past 30 years at Gran Dolina, a cave located near Sima del Elefante, come from a species Huguet’s group calls Homo antecessor, which lived between roughly 900,000 and 800,000 years ago. Vertically oriented, flat cheek bones of H. antecessor resemble those of people today, unlike the older Sima del Elefante face fossils.

Evolutionary ties between those two ancient European Homo species remain unclear. Members of the Sima del Elefante species — who also left behind a small collection of simple stone cutting or chopping tools — might have survived until shortly after the arrival of H. antecessor, the researchers say. In support of that scenario, animal bones and plant remains excavated in the same sediment as the ancient midface fossils reflect mild temperatures and a setting dotted with meadows, woods, shrubs and streams.

If recent evidence holds up of extreme cold temporarily driving hominid populations out of Europe shortly before 1.1 million years ago, then the Sima del Elefante Homo species may have died out before H. antecessor arrived, the scientists say.

Huguet’s group presents a carefully reconstructed midface for one of the oldest known European hominids, says Harvard University biological anthropologist G. Philip Rightmire, who did not participate in the new study. He suspects, though, that the ancient Sima del Elefante crowd belonged to H. erectus.

Fossil remains of four H. erectus faces at Dmanisi display considerable variation in nasal structure and other midface traits, Rightmire says. One of those faces aligns closely with the Spanish midface discovery, he contends. After H. erectus left Africa, “I would put my money on a long-lasting regional [H. erectus] population occupying Dmanisi around 1.8 million years ago, with later populations moving into Europe,” Rightmire says.",sciencenews
https://sciencenews.org,Parenthood may help the brain stay young,https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parenthood-kids-brain-young-aging,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 09:00:00 GMT","Raising children may help your brain stay young.

A study of almost 38,000 adults finds that the more kids they had, the more synchronized the activity between certain brain regions became. The strongest association between the number of children and functional connectivity turned up in a brain network believed to aid in inferring others’ thoughts, researchers report in the March 4 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Coordinated activity within this network typically decreases with age, suggesting that child-rearing — which involves learning new skills — may provide long-lasting protection against brain aging.

“It’s very similar for males and females, so it’s not that pregnancy effect; it’s really a parenting effect,” says cognitive neuroscientist Edwina Orchard of the University of California, Santa Barbara.

Past brain-imaging research on parents often focused on how pregnancy changes the brain. But limiting child-rearing research to biological phenomena can overlook the environmental influences experienced by parents of all sexes.

While at Yale University, Orchard and her colleagues examined functional MRI scans of nearly 20,000 female and 18,000 male individuals who were middle-aged and older, using data from the U.K. Biobank database. As the number of kids parented went up, people of both sexes showed greater functional connectivity in the somatomotor network compared to those with fewer or no children. This network helps individuals interpret other people’s behaviors and figure out their wants and needs — an important part of caregiving, Orchard says.

Parenthood may shift brain region coordination in the opposite direction of age-related decline by providing a complex and novel environment that lasts for decades, Orchard says. But raising kids is just one way to introduce complexity and novelty, she notes. Complicated jobs, higher education and learning a foreign language can also enrich the brain.

The new study, however, cannot establish that raising kids caused the observed differences in brain activity. Other factors that influence the number of children, such as virility and societal norms surrounding parenthood, may also play a role.

Still, the results help flip the narrative about parenthood’s effect on the brain. “There’s a social rhetoric about parenthood being bad for the brain — this idea of ‘baby brain’ or ‘mommy brain,’” Orchard says. But “the cognitive challenges related to early parenthood, sustained across the life span, might actually be resulting in a brain that is more resilient.”",sciencenews
https://sciencenews.org,A quantum computing milestone is immediately challenged by a supercomputer,https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computing-milestone-challenged,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 12:08:12 GMT","The tug-of-war between quantum computers and classical computers is intensifying.

In just minutes, a special quantum processor, called a quantum annealing processor, solved a complex real-world problem that a classical supercomputer would take millions of years to complete, researchers claim March 12 in Science. And that supercomputer, the team reports, would consume more energy to run the whole computation than the entire globe uses in a year. However, another group of researchers claims to have already found a way for a classical supercomputer to solve a subset of the same problem in just over two hours.

Quantum computers leverage principles of quantum mechanics to potentially offer huge advantages in processing power and speed compared with the classical computers we’re familiar with in our daily lives. This capability theoretically allows quantum computers to tackle problems much faster than classical computers can.

The new, conflicting results follow similar claims made in recent years. The nascent field of quantum computing has been advancing in lockstep with techniques to make supercomputers more efficient, resulting in a closely matched rivalry. While quantum computers have demonstrated the ability to solve truly random problems faster than classical computers, they have yet to come out on top for physical problems relevant to real-world systems.

In the latest match-up, researchers at D-Wave Quantum Inc. in Burnaby, Canada, used a quantum computer equipped with a quantum annealing processor. Annealing processors differ from other, more typical quantum processors and have shown promise in conducting specific tasks. These processors are better equipped to tackle large problems because their quantum bits, or qubits, are coupled to many other qubits instead of just one, as in other types of quantum processors. But they are useful only for specific types of problems, such as optimization problems, and D-Wave’s computers have attracted scientific skepticism in the past.

For the new result, the D-Wave researchers used a quantum annealing processor to simulate quantum dynamics by using arrays of magnetized disordered pieces known as spin glasses. This setup is relevant to materials science, where understanding the evolution of such systems can help in designing new metals.

“This is a simulation of magnetic materials,” says Mohammad Amin, chief scientist at D-Wave. “Magnetic materials are very important in industry and daily life,” appearing in devices such as cell phones, hard drives and specialized medical sensors.

The researchers simulated the evolution of such systems in two, three and infinite dimensions. After trying to solve the problem with approximations on a supercomputer, they concluded that it couldn’t be done within a reasonable timeframe.

“It’s a milestone result in quantum computing,” says Andrew King, a quantum computer scientist at D-Wave. “We’ve demonstrated quantum supremacy for the first time on an actual problem of real interest.”

Physicist Daniel Lidar, director of the quantum computing center at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, agrees that the D-Wave team hit a milestone. “It’s very impressive work,” says Lidar, who was not involved in either study but works with a D-Wave device. “They really managed to perform quantum simulations on their hardware that are beyond the reach of current classical methods.”

But the claim isn’t without controversy. King and his colleagues posted a preliminary draft of their paper about a year ago on arXiv.org, providing another group of researchers the opportunity to scrutinize the findings.

Quantum computer scientist Joseph Tindall of the Flatiron Institute in New York City and colleagues simulated part of the same problem using a classical computer. They developed a method that repurposed a 40-year-old algorithm called belief propagation, commonly used in artificial intelligence. Their results, submitted to arXiv.org on March 7 but not yet peer-reviewed, claim to be more accurate than the quantum computer’s for certain cases of the two- and three-dimensional systems.

“For the … spin glass problem at hand, our classical approach demonstrably outperforms other reported methods,” the group writes in a draft of their study. “In [two cases] we are also able to reach errors noticeably lower than the quantum annealing approach employed by the D-Wave Advantage2 system.”

The classical simulations focused on only a subset of the D-Wave results, and the two groups are at odds as to whether the classical simulations can reproduce all the abilities of the quantum computer simulations, particularly for the three-dimensional system.

However, the quantum computer indisputably excelled with the infinite-dimensional system. Although not strictly physical, this system is useful for improving artificial intelligence. Simulating it classically would require an entirely different approach compared with the methods used for the two- and three-dimensional systems, Lidar says. Whether that can be done remains an open question.",sciencenews

The patients: A 59-year-old man (patient one) and a 64-year-old man (patient two) in Rochester, New York

The symptoms: Patient one was initially admitted to the hospital for respiratory failure after experiencing various symptoms, including a sore throat, difficulty swallowing and extensive weight loss for about six weeks. At the hospital, doctors ordered a computed tomography (CT) scan of the patient's neck, which revealed that he had mucus clogging his upper voice box and right-side vocal cord.

Patient two, meanwhile, was initially hospitalized for having low salt levels in his blood, which caused tissue swelling. His teeth were also in poor condition, which made it harder for him to eat or drink, leading to weight loss, and he had a chronic cough.

What happened next: When he was admitted to hospital, patient one seemed to be wasting away and had signs of bacterial blood poisoning. An additional CT scan, this time of his chest, showed that he had a buildup of fluid in his lungs . Doctors treated him with antibiotics and briefly put him on ventilation to support his breathing. The medical team later identified traces of fungi in the patient's urine and in coughed-up mucus from his respiratory tract.

Related: New cause of asthma lung damage revealed

In the hospital, patient two had a fever of 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius). A CT scan revealed multiple lesions in his chest and abdomen. In addition, traces of fungi were detected in his urine.

The diagnosis: Both patients — who were not affiliated in any way but were from the same area — were diagnosed with a rare fungal lung infection called histoplasmosis .

This condition occurs when people inhale spores of a harmful fungus named Histoplasma capsulatum, which usually grows in soil and the poop of birds and bats . Approximately 1 to 2 people per 100,000 in the United States are infected with histoplasmosis each year. However, most people exposed to the fungus don't develop any symptoms . Symptoms are more likely to emerge in people with lung conditions or weakened immune systems, compared to the general population.

In these two cases, the patients' symptoms may have been exacerbated by other diseases that they had before they developed histoplasmosis. For example, patient one had emphysema , a common type of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in which air sacs in the lungs are damaged, which constrains breathing.

The pair also smoked tobacco and cannabis.

The treatment: Following their diagnoses, the patients were prescribed antifungal drugs to combat their infections. However, despite this treatment, both died. Between 5% and 7% of patients who are hospitalized with histoplasmosis die of their infection.

What makes the case unique: Both patients in these cases were already using or planning to use bat poop as fertilizer to grow cannabis for personal use. Patient one had ordered bat poop — or guano — online, while patient two intended to use guano he'd found in his attic following a bat infestation.

In a report describing the cases , doctors noted that various online sources claim that bat guano is a ""natural superfood"" for cannabis plants because it contains lots of nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Meanwhile, numerous U.S. states have recently legalized the recreational use of cannabis — including Arizona in 2020 , New York in 2022 and Ohio in 2023 — which may be encouraging more people to grow their own cannabis, the report authors noted.

The dangers of using bat guano as fertilizer aren't unique to cannabis — the product would be risky for any gardening, the authors emphasized. But given guano is being marketed for cannabis specifically, there is a need to raise public awareness around the potential risks associated with using the poop in this way, they warned.",livescience
https://livescience.com,Jewish ritual bath discovered near Rome is the 'oldest discovery of its kind in the world',https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/romans/jewish-ritual-bath-discovered-near-rome-is-the-oldest-discovery-of-its-kind-in-the-world,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 20:13:29 GMT","Archaeologists working at Ostia Antica, an ancient Roman port city, have discovered the oldest Jewish ritual bath outside of the Middle East, along with an oil lamp decorated with a menorah dated to the fifth to sixth centuries.

The discovery of the ritual bath, known as a mikvah, ""confirms the extent of the continuous presence, role and importance of the Jewish community in Ostia throughout the Imperial age [of Rome],"" Alessandro D'Alessio , director of the Archaeological Park of Ostia Antica, said in a translated statement .

In the summer of 2024, archaeologists excavating in the heart of the ancient city found a narrow, rectangular room with a small staircase leading about 3.3 feet (1 meter) down into a plaster-lined pit. In one corner of the structure, there was a hole through which a pipe carried water to fill up the mikvah. These mikva'ot are used in the Jewish tradition to purify people and objects.

During excavation of the mikvah, the archaeologists also found fragments of plaster and marble, black-and-white mosaics, statues and oil lamps. One of the lamps was decorated with the image of a menorah on the top, and on the bottom, it had a depiction of a lulav, a palm frond often used in the Jewish autumn holiday Sukkot.

The combination of the structure and artifacts means that ""it is probable that this was a Jewish community center,"" Riccardo Di Segni , chief rabbi of the Jewish Community of Rome, said in the statement. ""The history of the Jews of Rome is enriched today by another invaluable monument that testifies to their ancient settlement.""

The Jewish presence in Rome dates back to the second century B.C., and by the time of the Roman Empire , the Jewish community had grown considerably. Although they were a religious minority, Roman Jews were generally accepted. This was particularly true in large and cosmopolitan cities such as Ostia, a port city just 19 miles (30 kilometers) west of Rome.

Minister of Culture Alessandro Giuli said in the statement that the mikvah discovery ""strengthens the historical awareness of Ostia as a true crossroads of coexistence and exchange of cultures, a cradle of tolerance between different peoples who found unity in Roman civilization.""

The oldest archaeological examples of mikva'ot date back to the late first century B.C. and were widespread in the Roman province of Judaea. However, they declined in number as Rome took over the region, particularly following the Jewish-Roman wars between A.D. 66 and 135, the statement reported.

Another contender for the oldest mikvah outside the Middle East is one at an ancient temple on Russia's Taman Peninsula . However, while some argue that this temple dates to the late first century B.C. or first century A.D., others say more information is needed to securely date it. The mikvah recently found at Ostia therefore represents the earliest well-dated example of the structure outside of Judaea.

""The mikvah is the sign of a living presence that has perpetuated itself over the centuries and shows us today the demonstration of an identity that many generations of Jews have managed to preserve, defend and enhance,"" Victor Fadlun , president of the Jewish Community of Rome, said in the statement.

The archaeological park is currently working to make the mikvah area accessible to the public.

The tusk was sitting in the drainage area of a creek bed on the O2 Ranch in Brewster and Presidio counties near Big Bend National park, according to a statement released by Sul Ross State University in Texas.

Columbian mammoths (Mammuthus columbi), a distant southern cousin of woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius), lived on the grasslands of what are now North and Central Texas up until around 11,700 years ago, according to the Texas Master Naturalists website, hosted by Texas A&M University. However, the discovery of mammoth remains in West Texas is very rare.

""Seeing that mammoth tusk just brings the ancient world to life,"" Will Juett, the O2 ranch manager, said in the statement. ""Now, I can't help but imagine that huge animal wandering around the hills on the O2 Ranch. My next thought is always about the people that faced those huge tusks with only a stone tool in their hand!""

Columbian mammoths coexisted with humans until the animals went extinct at the end of the last ice age . Researchers have proposed several potential causes for their extinction, including climate change, hunting by humans and disease, according to Texas Master Naturalists.

The hunter who found the tusk, who isn't named in the statement, took photos of the fossil inside the creek bed and showed them to Juett. The ranch manager then contacted Bryon Schroeder , director of the Center for Big Bend Studies at Sul Ross State University, and another archeologist. They contacted additional researchers and investigated the discovery.

Schroeder verified that it was a mammoth tusk, and the researchers spent two days excavating it from the ranch. They covered the tusk in strips of plaster-covered burlap to protect it and then built a frame to transport it to Sul Ross State University. During the excavation, the researchers didn't find any other mammoth parts.

""We realized pretty quickly there was not more to the skeleton, just an isolated tusk that had been separated from the rest of the remains,"" Schroeder said in the statement.

The researchers are now awaiting the results of carbon dating tests to tell them how old the mammoth tusk is, according to the statement.

The bones of Cheddar Man (whose reconstruction is pictured here) reveal he lived in the U.K. around 10,000 years ago. This reconstruction shows his probable dark skin.

Most prehistoric Europeans had dark skin, hair and eyes well into the Iron Age, about 3,000 years ago, new research finds.

Scientists found that the genes that cause lighter skin, hair and eyes emerged among early Europeans only about 14,000 years ago, during the late stages of the Paleolithic period — also known as the ""Old Stone Age."" But these light features were only sporadic until relatively recently, said study senior author Silvia Ghirotto , a geneticist at the University of Ferrara in Italy.

Lighter skin may have carried an evolutionary advantage for Europeans because it enabled people to synthesize more vitamin D — needed for healthy bones, teeth and muscles — in Europe's weaker sunlight. But lighter eye color — blue or green, for example — does not seem to have had major evolutionary advantages , and so its emergence may have been driven by chance or sexual selection, Ghirotto told Live Science in an email.

Ghirotto and her colleagues analyzed 348 samples of ancient DNA from archaeological sites in 34 countries in Western Europe and Asia, according to research published Feb. 12 on the preprint server bioRxiv , which hasn't been peer-reviewed.

The oldest, from 45,000 years ago, was from the Ust'-Ishim individual discovered in 2008 in the Irtysh River region of western Siberia; and another high-quality DNA sample came from the roughly 9,000-year-old SF12 individual from Sweden.

But many of the older samples were badly degraded, and so the researchers estimated those individual's pigmentation using ""probabilistic phenotype inference"" and the HIrisPlex-S system , which can predict eye, hair, and skin color from an incomplete DNA sample.

Out of Africa

Palaeoanthropologists think the first Homo sapiens permanently arrived in Europe between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago , which meant they weren't that far removed from their modern human ancestors in Africa. As a result, early Europeans initially only had genetics for dark skin, hair and eyes, which rely on hundreds of interconnected genes, Ghirotto said.

Even after lighter traits emerged in Europe about 14,000 years ago, however, they only appeared sporadically in individuals until relatively recent times — about 3,000 years ago — when they became widespread, she said.

The new study showed that the frequency of people with dark skin was still high in parts of Europe until the Copper Age (also known as the Chalcolithic period, which started about 5,000 years ago in Europe) and in some areas dark skin appeared frequently until even later, Ghirotto said.

Emerging traits

The researchers found that light eyes emerged among people in Northern and Western Europe between about 14,000 and 4,000 years ago, although dark hair and dark skin were still dominant at that time. (There are outliers, however. A 2024 genetic analysis showed a 1-year-old boy who lived in Europe about 17,000 years ago had dark skin, dark hair and blue eyes .)

The genetic basis for lighter skin seems to have emerged in Sweden at about the same time as lighter eyes, but initially it remained relatively rare, Ghirotto said.

The researchers also reported a statistical ""spike"" in the incidence of light eye color at this time, which suggested that blue or green eyes were more prevalent at that time than earlier or later.

Carles Lalueza Fox , a palaeogeneticist at Barcelona's Institute of Evolutionary Biology, is an expert on early European pigmentation but was not involved in the latest study.

It was a ""surprise"" to learn that some European individuals had inherited genes for darker pigmentation up until the Iron Age, which was relatively recent in genetic terms, he told Live Science in an email.",livescience

Fragments of a skull found in Spain reveal that human ancestors arrived in Western Europe far earlier than previously thought, a new study finds.

The bones were discovered in a cave in the Atapuerca Mountains that was already known as a spot used by Homo antecessor, the species that Neanderthals likely evolved from. But the new bones are hundreds of thousands of years older and shaped differently, suggesting that Homo erectus — an ancestor of modern humans — also lived in Europe during the Early Pleistocene (2.6 million to 800,000 years ago).

""This paper introduces a new actor into the study of human evolution in Europe,"" Rosa Huguet , a paleoanthropologist at the Catalan Institute of Human Paleoecology and Social Evolution and lead author of a study published Wednesday (March 12) in the journal Nature , said at a news conference ahead of publication.

Huguet and colleagues found the facial bone fragments while excavating the cave site of Sima del Elefante (""Pit of the Elephant"") in 2022. When a student told Huguet they had found bones, ""we were very excited,"" Huguet said, ""and in this moment, we thought — 95% sure — that we had a human remain.""

All of the fragments came from the left side of the face — specifically, the maxilla, or upper jaw and part of the cheek bone.

""We didn't know at the beginning what specifically it was,"" study co-author José María Bermúdez de Castro , a paleoanthropologist at the National Center for Research on Human Evolution in Spain, said at the news conference. But from the shape of the teeth, it was clear that the bones belonged to a human relative.

After more than two years of research, the team has published their analysis of the fragmentary skeleton, which they nicknamed ""Pink"" after Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, calling it the ""earliest human face of Western Europe.""

Archaeologists excavate at Sima del Elefante, Spain. (Image credit: Maria D. Guillén / IPHES-CERCA)

Homo erectus in Spain

This face is surprisingly different from that of H. antecessor, another early species found in Spain. H. antecessor remains have been found at several cave sites in the Atapuerca Mountains since 1994, and they date from 1.2 million years to 800,000 years ago. Similar to modern humans' faces, the face of H. antecessor is flat and vertical.

But the new, fully reconstructed facial skeleton of ""Pink"" from Sima del Elefante is strikingly different from the previously discovered H. antecessor remains, suggesting it does not actually belong to that species as originally thought . It has a more robust face that projects outward, making it look more like our much-older H. erectus ancestors.

Experts think the first expansion of hominins out of Africa began around 1.8 million years ago, when H. erectus moved out through the Levantine corridor, a narrow strip of land that connects Africa to Eurasia. Although sites with H. erectus remains are found throughout East Africa and Asia, finds of this age in Western Europe are few and far between.

This means the first hominin to make it to Western Europe was not H. antecessor as previously assumed, but probably H. erectus, at least 1.4 million years ago. Because ""Pink"" has some anatomical features that do not fit exactly with H. erectus, the team described it in their study as ""H. aff. erectus,"" where ""aff."" means ""affinis"" or ""similar to"" in Latin.

Based on the worn molars, the team concluded that ""Pink"" was an adult. But because so little of the skeleton remains, they were unable to figure out if the individual was male or female. Future paleoproteomic analysis of the tooth enamel, which has proteins that can indicate an individual's sex, may eventually reveal this information.

This is the third time that members of this research team have discovered hominin fossils in unexpectedly deep layers in this collection of caves, said study co-author María Martinón-Torres , a paleoanthropologist at the National Center for Research on Human Evolution.

In 1997, H. antecessor was first assigned to bones found in the Atapuerca Mountains dating to about 850,000 years ago, and in 2008, a couple layers above ""Pink,"" members of the team reported a fossil dated to 1.1 million to 1.2 million years ago as the ""first hominin of Europe."" Although they are separated by hundreds of thousands of years, ""Pink"" may be the same species as the 2008 bones, according to Bermúdez de Castro.

In addition to bones, the team discovered stone tools at Sima del Elefante. The simple tools were made out of local quartz, chert and limestone, said study co-author Xosé Pedro Rodríguez-Álvarez , a prehistoric archaeologist at the Catalan Institute of Human Paleoecology and Social Evolution, and animal bones found at the site show evidence of human-created cut marks.

""Pink"" provides further evidence that the Atapuerca Mountains formed an important corridor rich in natural resources that humans and animals passed through 1.4 million years ago, likely after arriving in the area from Eastern Europe.

But there are still questions about what happened around 1.1 million years ago. Harsh and cold climatic conditions may have led to the disappearance of H. aff. erectus, Bermúdez de Castro suggested, followed by the arrival of H. antecessor.

However, if the assumption of dramatic climate change in the Atapuerca Mountains is incorrect, it is possible that a residual population of H. aff. erectus coincided with H. antecessor for a short time, meaning two hominin species overlapped in Western Europe.

""The most important take-home message is that this fossil represents the earliest human fossil found so far in Western Europe,"" Martinón-Torres said, ""documenting a previously unknown human population in Europe.""

Work at Sima del Elefante and on ""Pink"" continues, Martinón-Torres said, including a search for more fossils to fully understand who these hominins were, where they came from, and what interactions they had with other hominins in the area.

The Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ices Explorer (SPHEREx) blasted off from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on March 11. at 11:10 p.m. EST.

Once it is fully online, the space telescope will scan the entire night sky a total of four times using 102 separate infrared color sensors, enabling it to collect data from more than 450 million galaxies during its planned two-year operation. This dataset will give scientists key insights into some of the biggest questions in cosmology: such as the ways galaxies take shape and evolve over time, the origins of water, and how our universe came to be.

This makes SPHEREx the perfect complement for the JWST, flagging regions of interest for the latter to study with greater depth and resolution.

""Taking a snapshot with JWST is like taking a picture of a person,"" Shawn Domagal-Goldman , acting director of the Astrophysics Division at NASA Headquarters, told reporters during a news conference on Jan. 31. ""What SPHEREx and other survey missions can do is almost like going into panorama mode, when you want to catch a big group of people and the things standing behind or around them.""

SPHEREx, which cost a total of $488 million and has been in development for roughly a decade, is set to map the universe by observing both optical and infrared light. It will orbit the Earth 14.5 times a day, completing 11,000 orbits during its lifetime to filter infrared light from distant gas and dust clouds using a technique called spectroscopy.

By peering through these clouds, the scientists operating the cone-shaped telescope hope to piece together an unprecedented picture of our cosmos using some of its most ancient light.

This will enable astronomers to study galaxies at various stages in their evolution; trace the ice floating in empty space to see how life may have begun; and even understand the period of rapid inflation the universe underwent immediately after the Big Bang.

""Literally a trillionth of a trillionth of a billionth of a second after the Big Bang , the observable universe went through a remarkable expansion,"" Jamie Bock, principal investigator of SPHEREx at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, said during the news conference. ""Expanding a trillion trillion fold, and that expansion expanded tiny fluctuations smaller than an atom, to enormous cosmological scales that we see today... We still don't know what drove inflation or why it happened.""

The newfound species is called Clavusodens mcginnisi, or McGinnis' nail tooth. The animal lived 340 million years ago and belonged to a group of sharks known as obruchevodid petalodonts, or ""chipmunk sharks"" because of their tiny size and unusual teeth.

These sharks grew to just 3 to 4 inches (7.5 to 10 centimeters) long and fed on crustaceans, worms and other prey on the seafloor, according to a statement released by the National Park Service (NPS). It's thought their tiny size helped them avoid large predators while foraging.

Researchers unveiled McGinnis' nail tooth in a study published Jan. 24 in the Journal of Paleontology . The species name is named after David McGinnis, a retired National Park Service superintendent, and their teeth, which resemble old iron nails.

Mammoth cave

A team of researchers plucked the fossils out of rocks inside Mammoth Cave, the longest cave system in the world. Mammoth Cave is a treasure trove for ancient fish fossils, with more than 70 different species identified within its walls, according to a 2024 study published in the journal Parks Stewardship Forum .

Underground rivers and streams forged the cave's passages, which are made up of rocks that have preserved marine sediment from the Carboniferous period (358.9 million to 298.9 million years ago). The cave has given researchers a unique window inside these rocks, and therefore the marine environments they preserve, according to the 2024 study.

Researchers have been documenting vertebrate fossils in Mammoth Cave since 2019. The work is challenging because of the cave's often cramped conditions and limited space to move equipment in and out.

""Many of these sites have low ceilings requiring crawling for long distances on hands and knees, and at times belly crawling,"" the researchers wrote in the new study. ""The fish fossils are frequently encountered in the cave ceilings or walls.""

The newly discovered fossils came out of the Ste. Genevieve rock formation and date back to 330.9 million to 323.2 million years ago. The fossils are the oldest obruchevodid petalodonts discovered so far, according to the study.

Researchers suspect that these ancient sharks may have lived in reef-like systems filled with marine invertebrates called crinoids, or sea lilies, that attached themselves to the sea floor like plants. However, that assessment remains speculative until researchers carry out more studies on the ancient fish and their habitat, according to the study.

In a first-of-its-kind discovery, archaeologists in China have unearthed the 2,200-year-old burial of a woman whose teeth had been painted with cinnabar, a toxic red substance.

Cinnabar is a bright-red mineral that's made of mercury and sulfur. Although it's been used since at least the ninth millennium B.C. in religious ceremonies, art, body paint and writing, this is the first time it's been found on human teeth, according to a study published Feb. 24 in the journal Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences .

""This is the first and only known case of cinnabar being used to stain teeth in antiquity and throughout the world,"" study senior author Qian Wang , a professor of biomedical sciences at the Texas A&M University College of Dentistry, told Live Science in an email.

Archaeologists found the unusual remains while excavating a cemetery in Turpan City, in the Xinjiang region of northwestern China. Based on the cultural objects found in various graves, the archaeologists concluded that the deceased were Gushi people, who followed the Subeixi culture. The Subeixi culture, a horse riding pastoralist culture in which women rode horses using saddles , flourished in the Turpan basin nearly 3,000 years ago.

The cemetery lay on the main route of the Silk Road. The site was dated to 2,200 to 2,050 years ago via radiocarbon dating , putting it in the time frame when the Silk Road was active with the trade of precious goods, including cinnabar.

One of the graves in the cemetery held the remains of four individuals, including a juvenile. However, one adult skeleton in the burial stood out because its teeth had traces of red pigment. An anatomical analysis revealed that this individual was female and had died between the ages of 20 and 25. Intrigued, researchers scraped off a sample of the red pigment and studied it with three different spectroscopy methods, which can reveal the makeup of chemicals in a sample.

The analysis revealed that the pigment was cinnabar, which had been mixed with an animal protein, perhaps egg yolk or egg white, so it could be painted on the woman's teeth.

The team nicknamed the woman the ""Red Princess of the Silk Road"" after the "" Red Queen ,"" a female Maya aristocrat from seventh-century Mexico whose corpse was found covered in cinnabar powder inside a limestone sarcophagus.

Red Princess of the Silk Road

The Red Princess's teeth are an anomaly, as the Xinjiang region is not a source of cinnabar. However, it was mined and traded along the Silk Road in antiquity, the researchers noted. China and Europe, the beginning and end of the Silk Road, were the two most significant cinnabar-producing areas along this trade route. So it's possible that the cinnabar from the Turpan cemetery came from Europe, West Asia or other areas within China, such as the southwest, which was historically mined for cinnabar.

Although it's unknown why the woman's teeth were painted red, Wang said it could be ""related to cosmetic enhancements, social status, or shamanism, or some kind of combination."" Other mummies with facial paintings and tattoos have been found in the region and even the newly excavated cemetery, he noted. So it's possible that the Red Princess had facial painting or tattoos, distinct hairstyles, head dressing and costumes to go with her red teeth, Wang said.

Study co-author Li Sun , a professor of geology at Collin College in Texas, emphasized the dangerous nature of cinnabar application. She pointed out that during the whole process, from the preparation of the red pigment to its application (probably multiple times) inside the mouth, the red-toothed woman and her helpers might have inhaled fine particles of cinnabar or mercury vapors. Inhaling these substances is associated with harmful neurological effects such as headaches, insomnia, tremors, and cognitive and motor dysfunction, according to the World Health Organization .

Surprisingly, Wang and his team didn't find any evidence of mercury poisoning in her bones even though there's circumstantial evidence that it was applied repeatedly during her lifetime. ""No traces of mercury were detected in her mandible, ribs and femur,"" Wang said. ""Perhaps it was not [on her teeth] long enough to allow the toxin to be concentrated to a detectable level.""",livescience
https://livescience.com,Quantum-inspired storage can store 100s of terabytes of data on a tiny crystal — with plans to make them into much larger discs,https://www.livescience.com/technology/electronics/quantum-inspired-storage-can-store-100s-of-terabytes-of-data-on-a-tiny-crystal-with-plans-to-make-them-into-much-larger-discs,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 13:00:10 GMT","The technology works by shining a laser with a specific amount of energy that will excite an electron, which is then 'trapped' in the structure. A scaled up version of this device may one day store petabytes of data.

Scientists have devised a way to store and read data from individual atoms embedded in tiny crystals only a few millimeters in size (where 1 mm is 0.04 inches). If scaled up, it could one day lead to ultra-high density storage systems capable of holding petabytes of data on a single disc — where 1 PB is equivalent to approximately 5,000 4K movies.

Encoding data as 1s and 0s is as old as the entire history of computing , with the only difference being the medium used to store this data — moving from vacuum tubes flashing on and off, tiny electronic transistors, or even compact discs (CDs), with pits in the surface representing 1s and smoothness indicating 0.

The hunt is now on for even denser data storage, which is leading scientists to the subatomic world. In a new study published Feb. 14 in the journal Nanophotonics , researchers have used an electron trapped by a defect in a crystal to represent a 1 with the lack of a trapped electron indicating 0.

The work was inspired by quantum techniques, the scientists said. In particular, they integrated solid-state physics applied to radiation dosimetry with a research group working strongly in quantum storage — but this specific work builds classical computing memory.

The technology works by shining a laser with a specific amount of energy that will excite an electron. At this point, a reading device may register the presence of light. No light means no trapped electron.

This only works when the crystals include defects, such as an oxygen vacancy or a foreign impurity. ""These defects present very nice characteristics,” first author of the study, Leonardo França , postdoctoral researcher in physics at the University of Chicago, told Live Science. ""One of them is the ability to store charge.""

Knowing this, the team used rare earth ions as dopants — impurities added to a material to alter its properties — with the key lying in devising a way to excite an electron from a specific rare earth ion so it then becomes trapped. If imagining how a CD works, this would be equivalent to creating a pit.

""We have to provide sufficient energy to release an electron from a rare earth ion and the defect — a nearby defect — will sense that,"" said França. ""So you capture the electron by an intrinsic electric field. This is the writing part.""

Then you come to reading the data. ""Basically, you have to use another light source so that the electron will be released from the defect,"" said França. ""And that leads to a recombination of charges, and that leads to emission of light.""

Building data storage of the future

If the process worked exactly like this, the data would be erased every time it was read, but using lower amounts of light would only ""partially erase information,"" said França. So it would fade over time, in a similar way that data held in tapes fades over 10 to 30 years.

While the team used the rare earth element praseodymium and an yttrium oxide crystal, the work could equally extend to other non-rare earth element crystals with other non-dopants. But rare earth elements have the advantage of providing known and specific wavelengths that enable us to excite electrons using standard lasers.

The researchers’ initial aim was to address individual atoms. They haven’t yet achieved this goal, but França believes that the technique the team has pioneered puts them on the right track.

Appetite for further research is attributed to how scalable this technology is, potentially ushering in low-cost, high-density storage formats in the future for various applications, França said.

The good news is that the optical, laser side of the equation is already well understood and cheap. Likewise, the crystal would cost little money to produce at scale. That leaves the cost of acquiring the rare earth elements and devising a way to introduce defects using mass manufacturing methods.

If these obstacles can be overcome, the crystal could be fabricated as a disc, he added, and be read by inexpensive readers. The final question would be around how densely you can store data on a hypothetical disc.

""In our crystal, where we have around 40mm3 [0.002 cubic inches], we could store a few hundred terabytes,” França told Live Science. After performing some calculations, he put the figure at approximately 260 TB.

That figure is based on the crystal the scientists investigated, but França sees a future in which you could easily increase the defect density. This naturally leads to the possibility of PBs of data stored on a single device the size of a disc.",livescience
https://livescience.com,A giant extraterrestrial 'wave' hit Earth 14 million years ago — and may have dramatically altered our planet's climate,https://www.livescience.com/space/astronomy/a-giant-extraterrestrial-wave-hit-earth-14-million-years-ago-and-may-have-dramatically-altered-our-planets-climate,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 12:00:00 GMT","Like a ship sailing through changing weather at sea, our solar system 's journey around the center of the Milky Way takes it through varying galactic environments — and one of them may have had a lasting impact on Earth's climate, a new study suggests.

Observations from the European Space Agency 's recently retired Gaia mission indicate that around 14 million years ago, our solar system passed through a dense, star-forming region in the direction of the constellation Orion. This region is part of a vast network of star clusters that spans nearly 9,000 light-years and is sculpted into a structure that astronomers have dubbed the Radcliffe Wave in honor of the Harvard Radcliffe Institute in Massachusetts, where the wave’s existence was confirmed.

When our solar system swirled through this structure millions of years ago, it may have received an increased flow of interstellar dust. The timing of this event aligns with Earth's transition from a warmer to a cooler climate, as reflected in the expansion of the Antarctic Ice Sheet . This raises the possibility that the encounter could have contributed to that climatic shift in concert with several other factors and ongoing processes, the new study posits.

Further research may be able to test this theory. If unusually high abundances of radioactive elements — which are expected from such substantial dust influx — are indeed ever spotted in our planet's geological record, it would strengthen the study's hypothesis, ""because you would have a geological signature and an astronomical perspective that can explain it,"" study lead author Efrem Maconi , a doctoral student in astrophysics at the University of Vienna, told Live Science.

He and his colleagues described the findings in a paper published last month in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics . However, spotting the crucial evidence in our planet's geological record — a 14-million-year-old spike in the abundance of a rare iron isotope called iron-60, which is commonly released by supernovas but extremely rare on Earth — will not be easy.

""Looking back in time is hard — no matter if you're doing it in space or Antarctica,"" Teddy Kareta , an astronomer at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona who was not involved with the new research, told Live Science. ""This is a really exciting scenario they've hypothesized, but finding concrete evidence for it mattering for the Earth's climate, or even assessing the increase in dust flux that the solar system experienced, might take quite a bit of time and quite a bit of work from across the sciences.""

""We are really talking about yesterday""

Even though the Radcliffe Wave resides in our galactic backyard, at just 400 light-years away, astronomers just noticed it in 2020 thanks to the Gaia telescope's ability to pinpoint the distances and velocities of known star-forming gas clouds, which allowed astronomers to create a 3D map of the solar neighborhood.

Using Gaia's most recent data, Maconi and his colleagues simulated the journey of 56 young star clusters associated with the Radcliffe Wave, tracing both their current orbits in the Milky Way and their pre-birth trajectories, which were inferred from their natal molecular clouds. This allowed the researchers to essentially ""go back in time and see where they were in the past in relation to the solar system,"" Maconi said.

The researchers found that our solar system was at its closest point to the Orion region around 14 million years ago, approaching within 65 light-years of at least two local, dust-heavy star clusters: NGC 1980 and NGC 1981. At the time, our solar system was largely as it is today; Earth and the other planets had been formed for more than 4 billion years. Yet, in cosmic terms, ""we are really talking about yesterday,"" Maconi said.

The simulations suggest that our solar system spent roughly 1 million years within this dense region, coinciding with our planet's ""Middle Miocene"" transition from a warmer to a cooler climate. That points to the possibility that substantial interstellar dust could have blocked some of the sun's radiation, thereby accelerating the planet-wide cooling, the new study posits.

""It's a big claim to suggest galactic influences on the climate of the Earth,"" Kareta said. But ""the agreement in timing between both events should certainly motivate astronomers and geologists alike to try to assess the likelihood of this scenario in more depth.""

An extraordinary claim without extraordinary evidence — yet

There is ""reasonable evidence to believe that Earth's voyage around the Milky Way influenced its geology,"" Chris Kirkland , a geologist at Curtin University in Australia who was not involved with the new study, told Live Science.

For instance, previous research led by Kirkland suggested frequent, high-energy impacts from meteorites during Earth's youth contributed to the production of continental crust on Earth. Kirkland declined to comment on the idea that extraterrestrial dust — as opposed to impacts — may have influenced Earth's climate, however.

In the new study, Maconi and his team noted that the extraterrestrial dust reaching Earth would need to spike by at least six orders of magnitude higher than present-day levels to fully account for planet-scale climate effects. More subtle, indirect influences were more likely at play, and these effects would have unfolded over hundreds of thousands of years, setting them apart from current, human-driven climate change , Maconi said.

Even these differences are difficult to decipher, however, primarily because the geological record for the telltale iron-60 isotope stops at around 10 million years ago. Moreover, iron-60 is unstable, with a half-life of about 2.6 million years, making it especially challenging to detect a signal from an event that occurred 14 million years ago.

""The challenges in peering far back into the history of the Earth's climate clearly limit our ability to assess the likelihood that the Radcliffe Wave had climatological effects at present,"" Kareta said, ""but advances in instrumentation and analysis techniques will likely facilitate us doing better in the future.""

There may be other places in our solar system that, unlike Earth's landscape-recycling geological processes, might preserve either the dust itself or the telltale spike of extraterrestrial radioactive elements, Kareta added. These could include deep craters on the moon, specifically near its poles, which receive no sunlight throughout the year and should, in principle, stay cold and stable over long timescales, he said.

""Solar-system-wide processes ought to have left solar-system-wide evidence,"" Kareta said.",livescience

https://theconversation.com,Mass layoffs at Education Department signal Trump’s plan to gut the agency,https://theconversation.com/mass-layoffs-at-education-department-signal-trumps-plan-to-gut-the-agency-251674,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 19:01:31 GMT","The Trump administration on Tuesday slashed staff at the Department of Education – firing roughly 1,300 employees – as part of its long-planned effort to eliminate the agency entirely. The move leaves the department with 2,183 employees, down from more than 4,000 at the beginning of the year.

The cuts also follow recent leaks that President Donald Trump was planning to sign an executive order calling for the department’s dismantling, based on drafts first obtained by The Wall Street Journal.

Although the president has broad executive authority, there are many things he cannot order by himself. And one of those is the dismantling of a Cabinet agency created by law. But he seems determined to hollow the agency out.

As an education expert, who has written and spoken widely on the push to privatize U.S. educational services, I see this latest effort as a residual campaign promise to abolish the department. It’s also part of the wave of executive actions creating legal and policy uncertainty around funding for children in local schools and communities.

The draft order, in 2 parts

On the surface, a demand to end the Education Department is nothing new.

Trump’s campaign platform included a call to abolish the department. It’s a call that literally began Project 2025’s education chapter as well.

What’s different now is Trump’s apparent strategy of doing what he can to eliminate the department on his own authority while seeking the congressional approval he legally needs.

The drafted new order has two parts that follow this logic.

The first directs Education Secretary Linda McMahon to create a plan for eliminating whatever the administration can on its own. Under that section, McMahon is to pay special attention to any programs that might fall afoul of the administration’s earlier orders on diversity, equity and inclusion – or DEI – initiatives.

The second part notes that these actions should follow existing law and administrative guidance. That amounts to an assertion of authority for Trump’s Office of Management and Budget.

Basically, it appears Trump is reminding everyone that he controls the Department of Education’s operational budget. At the same time, I believe he is implicitly calling on Congress to finish McMahon’s job by removing any lingering legal barriers to the agency’s final dismantling.

Whether Congress will do so is purely speculative, especially in the current political environment.

In 2023, a bipartisan majority of U.S. House members voted down a proposal to eliminate the Education Department. But Joe Biden was president then. He almost certainly would have vetoed any such bill that passed anyway.

It’s a different calculus to ask what the House would do under pressure from Trump. But even now, the Senate also gets its say. And it would take 60 votes to break any Democratic-led filibuster and eliminate the department.

A ‘final mission’

So, in one sense, a Trump order would just reinforce what he’s already done: gut agency staff and halt activity, while calling on Congress to finish the job.

But that brings the focus back to the first part of the order: directing the new education secretary to identify places in the department Trump can cut on his own – or at least transfer to other agencies.

As the March 11 mass layoffs show, it’s not even clear such a plan is needed for McMahon to try to begin dismantling the agency.

Even before these cuts, through Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, the administration all but froze a key piece of the Education Department: the Institute for Education Sciences, its nonpartisan research arm.

And on her first full day on the job, McMahon sent a directive to department employees calling the dismantling of their agency a “final mission.” To that end, the administration could decide to freeze hiring and some funding programs within the department.

The Trump administration tried a version of this with the federal Head Start program, which helps low-income families prepare their pre-K children for school. But it rescinded that plan in January alongside a pause on more general spending freezes across the federal government.

The March layoffs are telegraphing an extreme move: a wholesale decimation of the Education Department, as Musk’s team did to the U.S. Agency for International Development. That action effectively shut down most of USAID, with a plan to house what remains under the State Department.

Legal and policy uncertainty

Whether any such activities are legal, even under a Trump executive order, is another question.

They will all be challenged in court, adding to the flurry of lawsuits against the administration, many of which have prompted federal judges to pause Musk’s efforts in particular.

Then the question becomes whether Trump’s team will even listen to any judicial demands to stop whatever plans they draw up for the Education Department. The administration is openly questioning such judicial authority. And in at least one instance – when ordered to release billions of dollars in federal grants – it has refused to comply.

In other words, a Trump executive order to dismantle the Education Department will create considerable legal and policy uncertainty.

It’s well known that Trump and allies want to eliminate the department and that he cannot do so legally without Congress.

The draft executive order seems to indicate that the Trump administration acknowledges those limitations – at least officially. But the draft order and the department’s mass layoffs raise the possibility that Trump might proceed anyway.

About the only thing clear at the moment is that billions of dollars in public educational programs across the country are at stake in the outcome of these decisions.

And the extent to which Trump’s latest directive has real consequences for that funding will be determined by the extent to which Congress voluntarily surrenders its own responsibility and authority in this space.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,Can the Trump administration legally deport Palestinian rights advocate Mahmoud Khalil? 3 things to know about green card holders’ rights,https://theconversation.com/can-the-trump-administration-legally-deport-palestinian-rights-advocate-mahmoud-khalil-3-things-to-know-about-green-card-holders-rights-252019,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 20:05:31 GMT","Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said that the government will deport lawful permanent residents who support Hamas and came to the U.S. as students “with an intent rile up all kinds of anti-Jewish student, antisemitic activities,” referencing the Palestinian rights protests at universities in 2024.

“And if you end up having a green card – not citizenship, but a green card – as a result of that visa while you’re here and those activities, we’re going to kick you out. It’s as simple as that. This is not about free speech. This is about people that don’t have a right to be in the United States to begin with,” Rubio said on March 12, 2025.

That policy has now ensnared Mahmoud Khalil, a recent graduate of Columbia University and a leader in the Palestinian rights protest movement at the school. Khalil, a Palestinian who was born in Syria, faces deportation after he was arrested on March 8, 2025, in New York City. The Department of Homeland Security said that the secretary of state had determined Khalil’s presence or activities in the country posed “serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”

Khalil, a Palestinian who was born in Syria, entered the U.S. on a student visa in 2022. In 2024, he received a green card and became a lawful permanent resident – meaning he has the legal right to work and stay in the U.S. There are an estimated 12.8 million lawful permanent residents in the country.

Khalil’s lawyers say that his arrest and pending deportation are unconstitutional.

In many respects, the rights of lawful permanent residents and citizens are similar. Yet citizens and lawful permanent residents do not enjoy equal status under the law.

The Supreme Court and other courts recognize that lawful permanent residents have First Amendment rights to free speech.

Yet the Supreme Court upheld deporting lawful permanent residents in the 1950s based on their political activity, in particular membership in the Communist Party.

So, while lawful permanent residents may not be criminally prosecuted for their political speech or activity, what they say or write may well affect their ability to remain in the U.S., if the government determines that they are a security risk.

I’m a scholar of immigration law. Here are three major differences between the rights of citizens and lawful permanent residents.

1. Limited political rights

Lawful permanent residents are people born in other countries who can legally work and live in the U.S. for as long as they like. They may enlist in the U.S. armed forces, apply to become U.S. citizens, and are legally protected against discrimination by private employers.

States also generally cannot discriminate against lawful permanent residents – though states may require certain groups of people, such as teachers or police, to have U.S. citizenship.

Between 1820 and 1920, noncitizens routinely participated in different aspects of government, including voting, holding office and jury service in many states and territories.

These days, states and the federal government generally allow only citizens to serve on juries, hold political positions and vote. With a few exceptions, such as voting in some local elections, permanent residents are not able to do any of these things.

2. Limited public benefits

The distinction between noncitizens and citizens extends to other areas of life, such as public benefits.

The Supreme Court has frequently stated, “In the exercise of its broad power over naturalization and immigration, Congress regularly makes rules that would be unacceptable if applied to citizens.”

In practice, this means that the federal government – and to a much lesser extent, states – do not offer public benefits, such as Medicaid and other kinds of government support, to lawful permanent residents and other noncitizens on the same basis as citizens.

For example, lawful permanent residents must generally wait five years before becoming eligible for certain programs intended to support low-income people, such as Supplemental Security Income and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

3. Reversal of immigration status

Finally, unlike citizens, lawful permanent residents can lose their legal immigration status.

Congress has enacted many grounds for deporting a noncitizen, or stopping them from entering the country.

Some courts have found that the U.S. government can deport a lawful permanent resident because of national security or terrorism concerns, even if the person has not committed a crime.

The Trump administration argues that they can deport lawful permanent residents like Khalil under the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, which states that a lawful permanent resident can be deported if the secretary of state has reasonable ground to believe that this person “would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”

The Trump administration had initiated deportation proceedings against Khalil on this ground.

U.S. law also provides that any non-citizen can be deported if the secretary of state and the attorney general jointly determine that the person is associated with terrorism, or poses a threat to the U.S. In addition, the law says an immigrant can be deported if they “endorse or espouse terrorist activity or persuades others” to endorse or espouse terrorist activity or support a terrorist organization.

Still, lawful permanent residents are entitled to certain basic rights, such as retaining a lawyer to represent them in administrative hearings and court before they are deported.

By contrast, the U.S. government cannot deport a U.S. citizen for any reason. However, sometimes U.S. citizens are deported by mistake.

Indeed, the Supreme Court has found that while it is constitutional to execute a military member for desertion in wartime, it would be cruel and unusual punishment to deprive them of citizenship.

Legal grounds for deporting noncitizens

There have been few recent court cases testing the scope of deporting lawful permanent residents on national security grounds based on pure speech.

In 1999, the Supreme Court ruled that if a person is deportable, they are deportable – even if there is some other reason that motivated the government’s deportation proceedings, such as a suspicion that the non-citizen is involved with crime or terrorism.

The Supreme Court also then held that the government could deport non-citizens for technical visa violations, even if the case was based on the government’s belief that the non-citizens were associated with a terrorist group.

There is also some precedent arguing that deportation based on “adverse foreign policy consequences” is too broad and nonspecific to be constitutional.

Indeed, Marianne Trump Barry, the sister of the president, held this opinion when she was a federal judge in the mid-1990s. But Samuel Alito, then an appeals court judge, overturned Barry’s ruling on procedural grounds in 1996.

For its part, the Supreme Court has occasionally held that very broad and indeterminate deportation grounds are “void for vagueness,” meaning so sweeping and imprecise that they are unconstitutional.

Khalil’s lawyers appeared with U.S. government lawyers before a federal judge in New York on March 12. Their goal: to get Khalil moved from internment in Louisiana back to internment in New York. But that may well be just the beginning of a long haul for the Palestinian student. Courts have proved reluctant to second-guess security grounds rationales in immigration cases. For these reasons, cases like Khalil’s may go on for years.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,Clean air rules boost US health and the economy − charts show what EPA’s new deregulation plans ignore,https://theconversation.com/clean-air-rules-boost-us-health-and-the-economy-charts-show-what-epas-new-deregulation-plans-ignore-251203,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 19:44:42 GMT","The Trump administration announced on March 12, 2025, that it is “reconsidering” more than 30 air pollution regulations in a series of moves that could impact air quality across the United States.

“Reconsideration” is a term used to review or modify a government regulation. While Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin provided few details, the breadth of the regulations being reconsidered affects all Americans. They include rules that set limits for pollutants that can harm human health, such as ozone, particulate matter and volatile organic carbon.

Zeldin wrote that his deregulation moves would “roll back trillions in regulatory costs and hidden ‘taxes’ on U.S. families.” But that’s only part of the story.

What Zeldin didn’t say is that the economic and health benefits from decades of federal clean air regulations have far outweighed their costs. Some estimates suggest every $1 spent meeting clean air rules has returned $10 in health and economic benefits.

How far America has come, because of regulations

In the early 1970s, thick smog blanketed American cities and acid rain stripped forests bare from the Northeast to the Midwest.

Air pollution wasn’t just a nuisance – it was a public health emergency. But in the decades since, the United States has engineered one of the most successful environmental turnarounds in history.

Thanks to stronger air quality regulations, pollution levels have plummeted, preventing hundreds of thousands of deaths annually. And despite early predictions that these regulations would cripple the economy, the opposite has proven true: The U.S. economy more than doubled in size while pollution fell, showing that clean air and economic growth can – and do – go hand in hand.

The numbers are eye-popping.

An Environmental Protection Agency analysis of the first 20 years of the Clean Air Act, from 1970 to 1990, found the economic benefits of the regulations were about 42 times greater than the costs.

The EPA later estimated that the cost of air quality regulations in the U.S. would be about US$65 billion in 2020, and the benefits, primarily in improved health and increased worker productivity, would be around $2 trillion. Other studies have found similar benefits.

That’s a return of more than 30 to 1, making clean air one of the best investments the country has ever made.

Science-based regulations even the playing field

The turning point came with the passage of the Clean Air Act of 1970, which put in place strict rules on pollutants from industry, vehicles and power plants.

These rules targeted key culprits: lead, ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter – substances that contribute to asthma, heart disease and premature deaths. An example was the removal of lead, which can harm the brain and other organs, from gasoline. That single change resulted in far lower levels of lead in people’s blood, including a 70% drop in U.S. children’s blood-lead levels.

The results have been extraordinary. Since 1980, emissions of six major air pollutants have dropped by 78%, even as the U.S. economy has more than doubled in size. Cities that were once notorious for their thick, choking smog – such as Los Angeles, Houston and Pittsburgh – now see far cleaner air, while lakes and forests devastated by acid rain in the Northeast have rebounded.

And most importantly, lives have been saved. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to periodically estimate the costs and benefits of air quality regulations. In the most recent estimate, released in 2011, the EPA projected that air quality improvements would prevent over 230,000 premature deaths in 2020. That means fewer heart attacks, fewer emergency room visits for asthma, and more years of healthy life for millions of Americans.

The economic payoff

Critics of air quality regulations have long argued that the regulations are too expensive for businesses and consumers. But the data tells a very different story.

EPA studies have confirmed that clean air regulations improve air quality over time. Other studies have shown that the health benefits greatly outweigh the costs. That pays off for the economy. Fewer illnesses mean lower health care costs, and healthier workers mean higher productivity and fewer missed workdays.

The EPA estimated that for every $1 spent on meeting air quality regulations, the United States received $9 in benefits. A separate study by the non-partisan National Bureau of Economic Research in 2024 estimated that each $1 spent on air pollution regulation brought the U.S. economy at least $10 in benefits. And when considering the long-term impact on human health and climate stability, the return is even greater.

The next chapter in clean air

The air Americans breathe today is cleaner, much healthier and safer than it was just a few decades ago.

Yet, despite this remarkable progress, air pollution remains a challenge in some parts of the country. Some urban neighborhoods remain stubbornly polluted because of vehicle emissions and industrial pollution. While urban pollution has declined, wildfire smoke has become a larger influence on poor air quality across the nation.

That means the EPA still has work to do.

If the agency works with environmental scientists, public health experts and industry, and fosters honest scientific consensus, it can continue to protect public health while supporting economic growth. At the same time, it can ensure that future generations enjoy the same clean air and prosperity that regulations have made possible.

By instead considering retracting clean air rules, the EPA is calling into question the expertise of countless scientists who have provided their objective advice over decades to set standards designed to protect human lives. In many cases, industries won’t want to go back to past polluting ways, but lifting clean air rules means future investment might not be as protective. And it increases future regulatory uncertainty for industries.

The past offers a clear lesson: Investing in clean air is not just good for public health – it’s good for the economy. With a track record of saving lives and delivering trillion-dollar benefits, air quality regulations remain one of the greatest policy success stories in American history.",theconversation

Or a crush of screaming fans, singing and dancing in unison at a Taylor Swift or K-pop concert. Or a sea of costumed “Star Wars” fans, lightsabers aloft, filling up movie theaters on opening night of a new movie.

Plenty of people like to watch sports, attend concerts and go to the movies. But what about those fans – the die-hard ones, if you will – whose dedication goes even further? The fans whose daily lives are deeply intertwined with their interests?

Die-hard fans tend to have a detailed, intricate knowledge. They collect, display and cherish memorabilia. They flock to iconic “pilgrimage” places: King’s Cross Train Station in London for “Harry Potter” fans, or Graceland in Memphis, Tennessee, for Elvis devotees. Their interests inspire them, shaping how they behave and view the world.

This level of devotion seems to go well beyond entertainment. Indeed, it may seem, well, almost religious.

Since 2018, I have been studying the realm of “comic-con culture”: fandoms built on comic books, superheroes, science fiction, anime and manga, gaming and cosplay. Based on my surveys and follow-up interviews, I have found that many dedicated fans describe something sacred about their experiences, something beyond entertainment and escapism.

Defining ‘sacred’

What does “sacred” mean, exactly?

A popular starting point is French sociologist Emile Durkheim and his 1912 treatise, “The Elementary Forms of Religious Life.” One of Durkheim’s most enduring legacies is how he defined religion in terms of beliefs and practices about “sacred things” that unify a community. The sacred, he explained, is something a group sets apart as powerful, transcendent and holy, clearly distinguished from the mundane world of everyday affairs.

This conception of religion includes gods or the supernatural, but it is not exclusive to them. Other beliefs and practices can be sacred, too. Durkheim’s insights have inspired many scholars, including those who study fan behavior.

In my own work as a sociologist, I organize this concept of the sacred into seven specific dimensions. For example, the sacred is powerful: a potent force that garners respect, fear and awe. The sacred is transcendent: revered and dignified beyond everyday affairs. And the sacred provides meaning: a source of essential values and purpose.

Comic-con culture

For several years, I’ve been distributing surveys at comic conventions on the East Coast of the U.S. and conducting follow-up interviews. The questions gather a variety of data, but also measure whether fans experience their interests as sacred, and in what ways.

The results are striking. While fans certainly enjoy entertainment and escape, their responses also highlight several aspects of how I define “sacredness” – particularly its ability to instill moral values, provide creative inspiration and reinforce communal bonds.

Many fans describe comic-con culture as a source of principles – such as inclusivity, compassion and self-development – that guide their behavior.

Comics “have always focused on issues of justice, inequality, power dynamics, and the ethics around things like use of force, etc., all of which have affected my own feelings and beliefs about ethical behavior,” one respondent shared. Other fans highlighted quotes from “Spider-Man” – “with great power comes great responsibility” – and “Harry Potter”: “We must choose between what is right and what is easy.”

Another respondent spoke about the Jedi: the ancient order of monklike warriors who channel forces of good to help others and maintain peace in the “Star Wars” universe. This universe “personifies how to go about treating the world around me and trying to do ‘the next right thing,’” the fan explained. “The Jedi, though not perfect, help me have a personal code in how I treat people. … If ‘Jedi’ were a real religion I’d probably be an active participant.”

Comic-con culture sparks passion and enjoyment; it is a wellspring of inspiration and creativity. The Japanese genres of anime and manga are “an art form of self-expression and it creates an [outlet] for individuals to express themselves freely,” one person wrote. In particular, they mentioned cosplay, which is short for “costume play”: the faithful recreation of a favorite character from a game, movie or comic, both in dress and mannerisms. Cosplayers are a mainstay of comic conventions, as are cosplay contests.

Another remarked, “being a fan of tabletop RPGs [role-playing games] allows me to create collaborative stories with others. I consider this storytelling powerful and important.”

Comic-con culture enables people to connect with like-minded individuals and forge meaningful relationships around these interests. It can also inspire a strong sense of fellowship.

Highlighting the power of these connections, one respondent said, “as an atheist, there’s not much I believe in. Being a fan has inspired me to believe in people, and that there is some purpose to my life.” Fandom groups “have given me decades-long friendships that span the globe,” another said.

Finally, comic-con culture is a sanctuary; it provides space for fans to be themselves, helps them cope with personal struggles, and inspires hope.

This was a prominent theme. For example, one attendee from Philadelphia divulged mental health issues but explained how his involvement in board-game tournaments and the role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons offered a safe space from anxiety: “I feel like when I’m doing these things, I can really be me. So, it’s more about letting myself be my true self and not feeling, or not caring, about the others around me that are judging me.”

Given these findings, I believe that social scientists need to consider popular culture more seriously as a fundamental feature of society that people can make sacred in different ways.",theconversation

But only a portion have been thoroughly evaluated for their toxicity due to time, cost, ethical concerns and regulatory limitations.

To safeguard public health, researchers at organizations such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Chemicals Agency evaluate the safety of the potentially hazardous chemicals people are likely to come into substantial contact with. These include volatile organic compounds such as formaldehyde, air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide, consumer chemicals such as bisphenol A, and herbicides such as atrazine. Recently, “forever chemicals” that persist in the environment, such as perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS), have been the focus of human toxicity assessments.

There are thousands of other chemicals used by industry that haven’t been thoroughly tested. To be efficient and cost-effective, these chemicals are prioritized for targeted testing. I am a toxicologist who studies how chemicals affect human health, particularly when they cause harmful effects. Better understanding the process of determining the toxicity of chemicals could help make them safer.

Chemical safety and toxicity testing

Historically, researchers have tested the safety and toxicity of chemicals by using biological assays, or bioassays. These tests involve exposing nonhuman animals – often rodents such as rats or mice – to a substance in controlled conditions to study its biological effects, including its potential harms.

Different types of studies are designed to analyze different effects from chemicals. These include immediate effects, effects from both short-term and long-term exposure, and reproductive or developmental effects. The key premise in using bioassays in animals is that researchers can use the results to help understand the chemical’s safety for people.

There are, however, significant limitations in using animals to conduct these studies.

First, it can be difficult to extrapolate results obtained from lab animals to humans. There are notable differences in anatomy, physiology, biochemistry and genetics between laboratory animals and people. In some cases, a chemical that is highly toxic to humans may be relatively harmless to other species. Moreover, even within a given species, there can be significant differences in how the body breaks down molecules, a process critical to determining a chemical’s toxicity.

It can also be costly to conduct research in animals. For example, a full battery of toxicology tests for a pesticide can cost between US$8 million and $16 million. Many of these studies take a long time to conduct, with some requiring up to two years.

There are ethical concerns, too, about using animals to test the toxicity of chemicals. Many governmental agencies and commercial entities have committed to efforts that replace, reduce or refine the use of animals in research and testing.

Researchers are developing a number of ways to replace animal testing in assessing chemical safety. Often called new approach methodologies, these methods aim to be both relevant to humans and scientifically clear. They also seek to be cost-effective, fast and broadly applicable.

In vitro tests

In vitro tests involve exposing biological materials such as human cells or microorganisms to different concentrations of a chemical of interest. These tests have several benefits, including easy control over experimental conditions, applicability to people, and the capacity to rapidly study many chemicals at once. The EPA’s ToxCast program uses data from in vitro tests to study thousands of chemicals.

There are numerous types of in vitro tests, each studying a particular quality associated with toxicity. For example, cell viability assays measure the effect of a chemical on cell survival and growth. Genotoxicity assays evaluate whether a chemical can damage genetic material. And receptor binding assays assess whether chemicals can interact with specific proteins on cells and trigger harmful effects.

One type of in vitro cell model are organotypic cultures derived from actual tissues or organs. These models retain the structural and functional qualities of their original tissue.

Other cell models originate from cells that self-organize in three dimensions. Examples include organoids and bioprinted tissues that can be tailored to represent specific tissues, such as the liver, skin and heart.

Microphysiological systems, or organ-on-a-chip models, use miniature 3D cultures of cells from various organs – such as the liver, heart and lungs – to mimic how these organs would function in the body. With these models, researchers can assess how toxic a chemical is to multiple organs, how it is broken down in the body, and how it may cause disease. This technique offers the possibility to study the effects of chemicals on the body in a more realistic and holistic way than with organ-specific models.

In chemico assays

In chemico assays are laboratory tests or experiments that examine how chemicals interact with proteins, lipids or other cell components in a test tube or other synthetic platform. They are well suited for studies on the mechanisms underlying chemical interactions.

Compared to in vitro systems, in chemico assays can be faster and more cost-effective. They may also be ethically preferred since no live cells or tissues are used.

However, they may have limited biological relevance since they cannot account for how these chemicals would work in a living organism. They are also not suitable to study many aspects of chemical toxicity, such as how it affects the overall function of a cell or the body.

In silico methods

One important aspect of chemical toxicity is figuring out what doses of a chemical trigger an unwanted side effect, or its pharmacodynamics. Another is how much of the chemical gets to its target and over what period of time, or its pharmacokinetics.

When little to no experimental data is available about a chemical, researchers often rely on computer models, or in silico methods. Predicting a chemical’s dose response often relies on the idea that chemicals with similar structures will have similar biological effects. Thus, if a researcher has data on chemicals similar in structure to a chemical of interest, computational models could estimate how it will affect the body.

Scientists often use what are called physiologically based pharmacokinetic models to predict how a drug travels through the body. This approach mathematically divides the body into compartments – such as the liver, kidney or blood – and simulates how the chemical moves between them based on its properties and the physiology of the body. Other in silico approaches, such as virtual tissue models and quantitative adverse outcome pathways, provide additional information on how chemicals cause adverse health effects.

In silico methods offer many advantages over traditional methods. They are faster and more efficient, and researchers can tailor virtual tests to more precisely simulate scenarios that would otherwise be infeasible to conduct. In silico methods are also easily replicable across labs and can help fill data gaps.

However, in silico methods also have several drawbacks. These include lower accuracy with faulty models, the need for experimental data to develop models, and the lack of standards to evaluate whether in silico models are credible enough to be used to inform regulation.

Regulatory acceptance

Policymakers are still developing regulations to assess alternatives to animal testing for chemical toxicity. These regulations vary across products and agencies.

For instance, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which comprises 38 member countries, has published nearly 100 guidelines on assessing chemical effects on human health and the environment.

The International Cooperation on Alternative Test Methods was created to facilitate chemical toxicity assessment. The many partner organizations within this alliance are making efforts to ensure that alternative methods are scientifically sound, reliable and relevant to human health and environmental safety and that they can be used to replace animal testing in regulatory decision-making.

With clear regulation and global collaboration, alternatives to animal testing can help advance public health, environmental safety and ethical testing practices.",theconversation

I’m used to hard work.”

Luis, whose name is a pseudonym to protect his identity, is part of the latest wave of immigrant workers who have, for decades, come to Chester County to work in Pennsylvania’s US$1.1 billion mushroom industry. He is a Venezuelan migrant who was granted Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, under the 2023 designation. TPS allows foreign nationals already in the U.S. to remain for six, 12 or 18 months – regardless of how they entered – if their home country is deemed too dangerous for them to return.

In February 2025, President Donald Trump terminated TPS for Venezuelans who received protection under the 2023 expansion. According to the Department of Homeland Security, this designation had allowed approximately 348,000 Venezuelans to remain in the U.S. legally, with many eligible for work authorization. Meanwhile, Venezuelans who were granted TPS under the earlier 2021 designation can retain their status until Sept. 10, 2025. This provides temporary relief but leaves their long-term status uncertain.

We are rural sociologists – a Penn State professor and a Ph.D. candidate – who study labor, migration and agriculture in the U.S. Our research examines how industries such as mushroom farming maintain a stable workforce. One of us recently published an article in the peer-reviewed journal Rural Sociology that highlights how Pennsylvania’s mushroom industry was already struggling with a labor shortage.

The termination of TPS for many Venezuelans, along with President Donald Trump’s broader immigration policies – including stricter border enforcement, increased deportations and tighter restrictions on work permits and asylum protections – will likely shrink the pool of available workers in Pennsylvania’s mushroom industry and other agricultural and food industries.

Changing face of the mushroom workforce

The mushroom industry in Pennsylvania has been shaped and sustained by major waves of U.S. immigration since the late 19th century.

William Swayne, a Quaker florist, is credited with beginning mushroom cultivation in Kennett Square, a small borough in Chester County, in the 1880s.

However, it was Italian immigrants, who began arriving in the early 20th century, who transformed Kennett Square into the “mushroom capital of the world.”

Today, Pennsylvania produces 69% of all mushrooms sold in the U.S.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Chester County alone produced 199 million pounds of mushrooms – mostly white button mushrooms – in the 2023-24 season. While Chester County remains the hub of production, mushroom farms also extend into adjacent Berks County and parts of northeastern Maryland.

Yet, workforce instability remains a pressing issue, as the industry has struggled for decades to recruit and retain workers.

Mushroom picking is physically demanding. Workers in humid, enclosed growing rooms carefully harvest delicate mushrooms by hand to prevent bruising. Pay is structured around a piece-rate system, where earnings depend on speed and productivity. While this model allows some workers to earn more, it also creates instability, as take-home pay fluctuates based on harvest conditions and market demand. These factors make it difficult to maintain a stable workforce.

As a result, mushroom production in Pennsylvania is highly dependent on immigrant labor. While there are no national statistics tracking the nationalities of workers in the industry, our empirical studies and ongoing field research indicate that most of today’s workers are from Mexico and Guatemala. In recent years, more have arrived from Venezuela and elsewhere.

Many of these newer arrivals have entered the U.S. through programs such as TPS and the Processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans, or CHNV. CHNV allows certain people from those four countries who have a sponsor in the U.S. and who pass a background check to live and work in the U.S. for two years. It was established to grant temporary work authorization to individuals fleeing crises in their home countries.

TPS and CHNV have been instrumental in addressing labor shortages in essential U.S. industries such as agriculture.

At the same time, the long-standing Mexican mushroom workforce is undergoing a generational shift and aging out of field labor. Their U.S.-born children sometimes work harvesting jobs in their teens but are unlikely to stay in agriculture long term.

Rise of mushroom labor contractors

To fill employment gaps, many mushroom farms now turn to labor contractors to recruit, manage and employ workers.

Contractors typically handle payroll, workers’ compensation and access to medical care if someone is injured.

On the surface, this system offers benefits for growers. It allows them to adjust their workforce depending on demand while reducing administrative burden and liability.

But for workers, this system can be a double-edged sword.

Evidence from other agricultural industries shows that workers hired through contractors may have less job security, fewer or no benefits, and less direct contact with farm owners – which makes it more difficult to negotiate wages or report workplace concerns.

Some Kennett Square farmworkers we have interviewed see contractors as a source of flexibility.

“I had to miss work for some weeks because my kid was sick, and I lost my spot,” one worker shared. “But then I reached out to a contractor and was able to get another job at a different farm within a day.”

However, that same worker went on to say that this new farm “has wider harvesting beds, and I am getting more tired and have more pain because of it.”

In other words, while labor contractors provide continuity in employment, workers may have less control over where they are placed or the conditions they work under.

For growers, contractors serve as an effective stopgap to keep mushroom farms in operation, but they do not solve their ongoing problem of attracting long-term employees.

Fewer workers, more expensive mushrooms

With fewer workers, mushroom farms may struggle to meet the demand from grocery stores, restaurants and food processors.

A reduced supply could mean customers pay more for mushrooms at grocery stores and restaurants. If retailers must source mushrooms from other states or abroad, prices could rise further due to transportation expenses, tariffs and supply chain disruptions.

Without policies that recognize the industry’s year-round labor needs, Pennsylvania mushroom growers will be left scrambling for alternative workforce solutions.

Lawmakers have attempted to address this issue through the Farm Workforce Modernization Act of 2021, which passed the House but stalled in the Senate. If enacted, the bill would create a Certified Agricultural Worker status, which would offer legal protection to experienced farmworkers, and expand H-2A visa eligibility to agricultural workers in year-round jobs such as mushroom farming. The bill also includes a mandatory phase-in of E-Verify for agricultural employers, a federal system used to confirm workers’ legal authorization to work in the U.S.

For now, mushroom farms – and the broader agricultural sector – must prepare for the ripple effects of more rigid immigration restrictions. Without intervention from policymakers, the strain on workers, growers and consumers is likely to intensify.

https://theconversation.com,Arrest of ex-president Duterte will shake up dynastic politics in the Philippines – and hand initiative to rival Marcos family,https://theconversation.com/arrest-of-ex-president-duterte-will-shake-up-dynastic-politics-in-the-philippines-and-hand-initiative-to-rival-marcos-family-251999,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 03:03:30 GMT","The ex-president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, could soon become the first Asian former head of state to be tried at The Hague.

The populist politician was arrested on Mar. 11, 2025, after the International Criminal Court issued a warrant relating to his “war on drugs.”

Some 6,000-plus people were killed during the crackdown. But despite the controversy surrounding his policies and the end of his presidency in 2022, Duterte remains an influential figure.

The Conversation U.S. turned to Lisandro Claudio, an expert on Philippine politics and history at the University of California, Berkeley, to explain how the arrest could impact domestic politics and whether this could mean the end of Duterte’s sway.

What do we know about the arrest and charges?

The arrest warrant issued by the ICC states that Duterte is charged with crimes against humanity relating to events that happened between Nov. 1, 2011, to Mar. 16, 2019. This is important as it covers a period not just when Duterte was president but also when he was mayor of Davao City – the richest city in the island of Mindanao.

Duterte went on to serve as president from 2016 to 2022, but he pulled the country out of the Rome Statute, the treaty that set up the ICC, in 2019. Nonetheless, the ICC says the alleged crimes fall within their jurisdiction as they were carried out before the Philippines ended its relationship with the ICC.

Duterte is alleged to have overseen the systemic use of murder, torture and rape against civilians.

He is accused of acting as the de facto leader of the Davao Death Squad, a group that was responsible for summary executions and the murder or disappearance of more than 1,000 people in and around the city. But importantly, the prosecution is also of Duterte’s nationalization of the strategy of death squads. On coming to power, he incorporated the “war on drugs” into the policy of the national police.

Based on the way the ICC warrant was written and reporting in the Philippines, it appears that former members of the Davao Death Squad and police officers may be testifying for the prosecution, including, it is thought, hit man-turned-whistleblower Edgar Matobato and ex-Davao City police officer Arturo Lascañas.

What role did the government play in the arrest?

Duterte’s arrest and rendition, for want of a better word, to the Netherlands appears to have taken place with the cooperation of the Philippine government.

President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr., the man who succeeded Duterte, held a press conference following the arrest in which he explained that despite no longer being part of the Rome Treaty, the Philippines is committed to supporting the International Criminal Police Organization, or Interpol. And it was Interpol that asked Manila to enforce the warrant after receiving it from the ICC.

The indication from Marcos was that the Philippine government had no choice but to comply with Interpol for two reasons. First, it is the expected behavior of a democratic nation to comply with international norms, and second, Interpol has helped the Philippines arrest fugitives in the past – including former mayor and suspected Chinese spy Alice Guo.

In short, Marcos is saying it is in the national interest to comply with the ICC arrest warrant.

Is it in President Marcos’ political interests, too?

The Philippines can’t dictate to the ICC when to issue a warrant, or to whom.

And it appears ICC prosecutor Karim Khan requested the warrant on Feb. 10, so the timing wasn’t determined by Marcos.

But that isn’t to say that it isn’t fortunate timing.

There is an important midterm election in May, and Marcos is keen to use it to consolidate his power amid an ongoing feud with Vice President Sara Duterte – the daughter of the now-arrested former president.

In 2022, Sara Duterte and Marcos ran on the same ticket for vice president and president. But this coalition between two family dynasties – Bongbong Marcos is the son of former Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos and still powerful matriach of the family, Imelda – broke down rather quickly.

Fighting between Sara Duterte and Martin Romualdez, the speaker of the House of Representatives and a cousin of President Marcos, strained the relationship.

But beyond the personality issues, there has been a divergence in policy between the Dutertes and Marcoses. Notably, under Marcos Jr., the Philippines has pivoted back to the U.S. by allowing American troops back into the country and taking a more aggressive stance in regards to China in the South China Sea.

This approach has been challenged by the Duterte family, which has been closer to China. In the first year of the Marcos administration, Rodrigo Duterte served as a sort of envoy to Beijing, although it became increasingly clear that this was more of an independent relationship between the former president and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

So could this be the end of Duterte’s influence?

That is certainly what President Marcos may be banking on.

The ICC prosecution of the father paired with a forthcoming impeachment of the daughter will neuter the Duterte clan’s power.

The reason this is so important for Marcos is that Sara Duterte has made it clear she wants to be the next president, and given the ill feeling between the two, there is a widespread assumption that if in power she will go after various members of the Marcos family.

With Duterte busy defending his case in The Hague, he will be unable to focus his efforts on helping his senator choices get elected in the midterms. It will also, presumably, end his bid to return as mayor of Davao City – a position that would give him a powerful bully pulpit.

No one should underestimate the charisma of Rodrigo Duterte; he is like a Donald Trump figure in that way. Many critics don’t fully understand the power of his charisma, his humor and the warmth that he displays to supporters – but it propelled him to high levels of popularity while in power.

And the public doesn’t see that charisma in his three children, including current Vice President Sara Duterte. Part of this is due to sexism – there is a lot of sexism in Filipino politics, so people are more likely to support a brash-talking man like Rodrigo Duterte, compared with his daughter. And Sara Duterte has problems of her own – notably the impeachment charges relating to alleged corruption while she was secretary of education.

Could this lead to a more polarized politics?

Your guess is as good as mine here. In the short run, the arrest of Rodrigo Duterte is clearly very good for President Marcos. And the small scale of the pro-Duterte protests suggest no great uprising against the arrest.

But what happens next – and how it is reported – is crucial. Filipinos love a political martyr. We saw this when former President Joseph Estrada was arrested and prosecuted over stealing public money in 2001 – his mughshot was adopted by supporters around the country. The same could happen to Duterte – it could go both ways.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,"The parallels between Kash Patel and William J. Burns, a scandal-mongering 1920s FBI director — an FBI historian explains",https://theconversation.com/the-parallels-between-kash-patel-and-william-j-burns-a-scandal-mongering-1920s-fbi-director-an-fbi-historian-explains-250863,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 12:50:49 GMT","After winning the 2024 election, President Donald Trump said on Nov. 30 that his new FBI director would be Kash Patel, a controversial lawyer and former Trump aide known for backing right-wing conspiracies.

Patel officially replaced FBI Director Christopher Wray, a 2017 Trump appointee, on Feb. 20, 2025.

By law, FBI directors serve a 10-year term to avoid White House political interference. Wray was in his eighth year. Patel stands outside the norm of FBI directors over the past century. They have generally been apolitical and independent investigators, upholding the rule of law. Patel’s own words, however, appear to contradict this.

Patel has supported Trump’s 2024 campaign vow to use federal power to “root out” political opponents.

“We’re going to come after you whether it’s criminally or civilly,” Patel said in December 2023. Patel’s 2023 book, “Government Gangsters,” includes a list of top-ranking government officials, which Democrats say is an enemies list.

As an FBI historian, I have researched political influence on the FBI. While it’s still early days, Patel’s confirmation has one clear, if century-old, comparison in FBI history.

The FBI of the past

Some observers have compared Patel to J. Edgar Hoover, the domineering FBI director between 1924 and 1972 who was renowned for FBI abuses. In 1956, Hoover created COINTELPRO, an illegal counterintelligence program that targeted communists, war protesters and even civil rights activists.

While Hoover also sometimes catered to White House political interests – such as monitoring foreign policy critics and providing information on political opponents – he did so only when it suited his particular interests. Hoover, who served under eight presidents, was an autonomous bureaucrat. He prioritized targeting communists and containing American culture from nontraditional forces, while vigorously promoting the FBI’s independence.

The more apt comparison to Patel in FBI history lies with Hoover’s immediate predecessor, William J. Burns, who served as director from 1921 through 1924.

Burns was a well-known author and owner of the Burns International Detective Agency, a private investigative agency. The public knew him as the American Sherlock Holmes.

Yet Burns never hesitated to use his power to protect the political interests of his superior, the politically connected attorney general, Harry Daugherty. The FBI is an agency within the Department of Justice.

Daugherty and Burns were at the heart of the so-called Ohio Gang, a corrupt cabal in the administrations of Republican Presidents Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge during the Teapot Dome scandal in the early 1920s. This scandal emerged after two oil tycoons bribed then-Interior Secretary Albert Fall, a friend of theirs, to secure contracts to drill on federal land at Teapot Dome, Wyoming.

Daugherty, although aware of this improper activity, refused to have the Department of Justice investigate. He also faced his own scandals involving graft, corruption and political intrigue.

Legislators of both parties eventually pushed back on Daugherty’s refusal. Still, it would take another two and a half years before the Department of Justice saw reforms.

The unfolding Teapot Dome scandal

Newspapers first raised questions about corruption in the Harding administration early in spring 1922 after FBI officials ordered an agent to drop a fraud probe to focus instead on the high price of bread. This FBI agent resigned in protest in May 1922 and passed his information to Congressman Roy O. Woodruff, a Republican from Michigan.

Various other senators and representatives of both parties following Woodruff’s lead cried foul and called for an investigation into the Justice Department.

Seeing no results, Congressman Oscar Keller tried to impeach Daugherty by the fall of 1922. Republican Party stalwarts, however, blocked the effort.

As retribution, Daugherty ordered Burns to investigate all the legislators trying to stand in their way.

FBI agents shadowed these legislators, read their mail and listened to their phone calls all to find something against them. Others had their offices searched.

‘No quitter’

By October 1923, some six months after news of the Teapot Dome scandal first broke, Sen. Thomas Walsh, a Democrat from Montana, finally began to investigate Teapot Dome as a member of the public lands committee.

A few months later, Democratic Sen. Burton Wheeler, via a select committee, also began investigating Daugherty’s attempts to halt any investigation into Teapot Dome. Other senators, including Republicans, met with President Calvin Coolidge – sometimes remembered as “Silent Cal” – and urged him to pressure Daugherty to resign.

The president sat quietly and stared. Daugherty did not.

Daugherty boasted in February 2024, as reported by the Lincoln, Nebraska, newspaper Journal Star, that he was “no quitter.”

Quietly, Burns tasked his FBI agents, some undercover, with developing a bogus influence-peddling case against Sen. Wheeler. Allies also sought information about Sen. Walsh “to smear him.”

The FBI’s spurious probes resulted in a federal indictment in Montana against Wheeler on April 8, 1924, for influence peddling. Wheeler was easily exonerated in a delayed 1925 trial.

Before the case was tried, Coolidge in March 1924 finally relented and forced an uncooperative Daugherty to resign. The president appointed a new reformist attorney general, Harlan Fiske Stone, to clean up a corrupted Justice Department, including the FBI. Stone forced Burns out from the FBI two months later. He was replaced by Hoover.

In his first moves as the new attorney general, Stone ordered Hoover to rid the FBI of “incompetent or unreliable agents” and to hire only those “of known good character” with legal training. Stone banned political investigations, unethical tactics – including wiretapping and entrapment – and targeting political enemies. Stone told reporters after appointing Hoover: “There is to be no more rifling of the desks of senators and representatives.”

The FBI today

For the next nearly 50 years, Hoover led a politically independent FBI. The Watergate scandal of the early 1970s revived issues of a politicized Justice Department. Ever since, for half a century, the Justice Department and FBI have purposefully and pointedly created a culture of investigative independence outside of politics.

Attorneys general from the Carter through Obama administrations limited contact between the FBI and White House to avoid political influence. FBI Director Louis Freeh independently investigated every purported scandal of the Bill Clinton administration during the 1990s. Director James Comey protected FBI investigative independence and refused to declare loyalty to Trump during his first term.

Trump’s and Patel’s own words, however, portend the FBI returning to the open political targeting of the Teapot Dome era.

https://theconversation.com,"US workers with remote-friendly jobs are still working from home nearly half the time, 5 years after the pandemic began",https://theconversation.com/us-workers-with-remote-friendly-jobs-are-still-working-from-home-nearly-half-the-time-5-years-after-the-pandemic-began-251758,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 12:51:39 GMT","Five years after the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted office life, American workplaces are settling into a new rhythm. Employees in remote-friendly jobs now spend an average of 2.3 days each week working from home, a research team that tracks remote employment has found. And when you look at all workers – and not just those in remote-friendly positions – they’re working remotely 1.4 days a week, or 28% of the time.

That’s a huge change from 2019, when remote work accounted for only 7% of the nation’s paid workdays, even if it’s down from the height of the pandemic in 2020, when 61.5% of all work was remote. And it’s a giant leap from 1965, the dawn of telework. At that time, fewer than 0.5% of all paid workdays were out of the office, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

As management professors who study remote work and collaboration, we’ve learned a lot about remote work’s challenges and its often underappreciated advantages. In analyzing the latest data, we’ve observed that employers and employees are still trying to strike the balance between working from home and at the office. That’s why employers’ requirements for in-person work don’t always align with their employees’ preferences.

Hybrid work is on the rise

Employers swiftly made the jump to remote work in 2020. Zoom, along with other previously unfamiliar collaboration software companies, became commonplace overnight.

Five years later, many employers, including JPMorgan, TikTok, Amazon and the federal government, are rejecting remote work, demanding that employees return to the office full time.

But these examples are not the norm.

According to Flex Index, which tracks the workplace strategies of over 10,000 U.S. companies quarterly, fully in-office work is on the decline. At the start of 2023, 49% of employers insisted that their staff report to the office daily. That percentage fell to 32% at the end of 2024.

Companies are also retreating from remote-only work. While 31% of employers were fully remote in 2023, only 25% had remained fully remote at the end of 2024.

Instead, companies are increasingly turning to hybrid arrangements, in which employees spend a part of their week at the office. About 20% of professional workplaces were hybrid at the start of 2023. Just two years later, hybrid’s share had risen to 43%.

Some industries are more remote than others

The story of remote work is more complicated than general trends indicate. Its prevalence varies widely by industry, location and employer size.

The technology, insurance, telecommunications, professional services, and media and entertainment industries are among the biggest adopters of long-term remote and hybrid arrangements.

The states where remote and hybrid work are the most popular are Massachusetts, Washington, Oregon, Colorado and California. The states where it’s the least popular are Kentucky, Louisiana, Nevada, Nebraska and Alaska. In part, some of these regional differences are due to where remote-friendly industries like technology and insurance are concentrated.

Businesses with 500 or fewer employees are the most likely to embrace remote work. Staying connected and coordinating with your colleagues is easiest with smaller teams, we’ve observed. Midsize employers, with 500 to 25,000 employees, are equally split across fully in-office, remote and hybrid strategies. Very large employers, which have 25,000 employees or more, are the most likely to adopt hybrid work.

These patterns show that remote work tends to be more popular among small employers, and in remote-friendly industries and states, whereas hybrid work has found a home in large companies.

What employees prefer

The remote work story is complicated also because employees have developed different preferences for in-office work, hybrid work and remote work over the course of the pandemic and since it subsided.

In 2024, roughly 25% of professional employees preferred office work, 35% preferred remote work, and 40% preferred hybrid work, according to research by Zoom. Even recent college graduates express a range of preferences: 15% prefer to work at an office, 20% prefer remote work, and 65% would rather have a hybrid schedule.

However, the ideal balance of office and remote work remains a point of contention. While employees favor three days at home and two in the office, employers prefer the opposite: three days in the office and two working remotely, the Zoom survey found.

Generally, the future of work looks hybrid. But the remote work of the lockdown days – what’s now known as “fully remote” – is also here to stay.

This is good news for those who prefer fully remote work. These employees are often parents or are caring for adults in need of assistance. They may live in rural communities or reside too far from their offices to regularly commute. Many LGBTQ+ employees and people of color have expressed a preference for remote work as a way to limit the microaggressions they experience on the job.

On the fifth anniversary of the COVID-19 lockdown, there’s no one-size-fits-all workplace. And we believe that’s a good thing.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,Middle age is a time when women are vulnerable to eating disorders,https://theconversation.com/middle-age-is-a-time-when-women-are-vulnerable-to-eating-disorders-247753,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 12:49:43 GMT","“No one expects a grown woman in her 40s to have an eating disorder. That’s for teenagers, right? Well, guess what – it happened to me.”

Alexa, a 44-year-old real estate agent, was telling me about her struggle with non-purging bulimia, which has come to control her life. We spoke in 2024 at a coffee shop as part of my ongoing research on eating disorders.

The names of my research subjects have been changed for this article to protect their identities.

“I didn’t understand what was happening for a long time,” Alexa said. “It didn’t even occur to me that it could be an eating disorder.”

She is not alone. A 2023 study estimated that over 9 million American women over 40 develop eating disorders. Some had eating disorders earlier in life and experience a resurgence at midlife. Others develop them for the first time in their 40s or older.

I am an anthropologist and licensed therapist who has researched and treated eating disorders for the past 30 years. I have also recovered from an eating disorder myself. I wrote a 2021 book about how contemporary clinical approaches to eating disorders can harm people and keep them sick. One of the things I uncovered in my research is that older women with eating disorders often fly completely under the radar, leading to increased health risks and even death.

My research leads me to conclude that this is due to health care providers’ misunderstanding of the cultural and existential factors affecting women in midlife, which can make this a time of increased risk of developing an eating disorder.

By the numbers

The numbers around eating disorders at midlife are sobering: Rates of eating disorders among middle-aged women have increased in recent years. As many as 13% of American women over 50 have eating disorder symptoms, slightly more than the percentage diagnosed with breast cancer.

One study found that 71% of women ages 30 to 74 wanted to be thinner, although 73% of them were at clinically normal weight for their height and age. Research shows that although anorexia, an eating disorder characterized by the severe restriction of calories, becomes less common after age 26, bulimia, where patients binge and then purge food from their bodies, doesn’t reach its peak until age 47. Binge eating disorder, or habitually eating excessive amounts in one sitting, can continue to plague women into their 70s.

Lack of treatment

Despite the prevalence of eating disorders in older women, they are often the least likely to get help.

In fact, flagrant symptoms of an eating disorder can be missed in these middle-aged people. At 52, Janelle, a schoolteacher, has struggled with anorexia for the past four years. Because she is petite, her slight frame hasn’t raised any alarms for medical professionals.

“My doctor told me I couldn’t possibly have an eating disorder because I’m too old,” Janelle told me. “I know I’m anorexic. I was anorexic as a teenager, so I know exactly what this is. My doctor just said I should consider myself lucky because a lot of women my age actually gain weight.”

This doctor’s response is emblematic of problems in eating disorder treatment more generally in the U.S. Though tools to assess patients for eating disorders are available, most physicians and even psychiatrists receive little, if any, training in their use. Learning to identify and respond to eating disorders requires that they go through additional – and costly – specialized training.

As a result, many hold erroneous popular stereotypes about these conditions, and so women with eating disorders aren’t getting the help they need.

Beyond stereotypes

In the popular imagination, eating disorders center on things young women supposedly care about; namely, being thin and attractive – specifically, attractive to men. This stereotype is a holdover from 19th- and 20th-century understandings of hysteria, which was thought to particularly afflict young women who craved but also feared male sexual attention.

According to this paradigm, middle-aged women are thought to be out of the sexual game, so to speak, so they ought to be immune to illnesses that focus on appearance.

This perception of eating disorders is not only wrong, but also dangerous because clinicians often don’t recognize these issues in women who don’t fit this stereotype.

In reality, eating disorders are deadly conditions that emerge from a convergence of genetic susceptibility, psychological factors, family environments, life events and cultural values. And they affect people of all genders, sexual orientations and races across the socioeconomic spectrum and the lifespan.

Although the drive for thinness often is the most obvious feature of these conditions, what I have found in my 30 years of research on this topic, including talking to over 200 patients with eating disorders, is that these illnesses are at heart about desperately trying to feel worthy of existing.

A concern with body shape, then, often reflects a much deeper existential crisis that can arise during times when a person’s identity is shifting as their body is changing. One of those times is adolescence. Another is middle age.

Seeking identity in middle age

Outwardly, eating disorders in middle age look a lot like eating disorders at any other age. But the body concerns and identity dilemmas associated with middle age are different from those that plague adolescence and young adulthood.

As women age, their metabolism slows down, their bodies don’t work the way they used to, and they visibly begin to wear their life experience. Questions of mortality and the meaning of life can come to the fore. It’s often a time of shifting dynamics within families. For those who have children, middle age is typically the time when those children are becoming more independent or leaving home. This is also a time when aging parents may require care.

At the same time, for women in particular, the pressures to remain fresh, fit and firm despite aging are monumental. The popularity of treatments like Botox, dermal fillers, Ozempic and the massive anti-aging industry have exploded as this over-40 market has been cultivated.

“We’re supposed to look 30 forever,” said Shelly, a 51-year-old marketing professional struggling with anorexia. “You’ve heard of the ‘middle-age spread’? There’s no way I’m going to let that happen to me.”

A woman’s worth

Progress in gender equality notwithstanding, women’s social worth in modern Western culture is still disproportionately determined by appearance and sexual and reproductive capacities.

It is not surprising, then, that looks and youth become the focus of existential distress for many women over 40. As older women struggle to secure a sense of value in a youth-obsessed world, food and eating can become a focus of attention that ultimately becomes destructive.

This doesn’t mean these women are vain or superficial. Rather, they have picked up on what their culture values, and they have internalized the message that thinness is a way to attain that.

“Our culture doesn’t value older women the way other cultures do,” observed Kaytlin, a 47-year-old office manager struggling with disordered eating. “The idea that older women should be revered for their wisdom and influence is foreign to us. Instead, we become invisible.”

My hope is that dispelling some of the erroneous assumptions that have driven both public perception and clinical practice about these illnesses will help women get the care they need.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,"Alien and Sedition Acts were reviled in their time, and John Adams was not sorry to see them go",https://theconversation.com/alien-and-sedition-acts-were-reviled-in-their-time-and-john-adams-was-not-sorry-to-see-them-go-246019,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 12:51:09 GMT","When John Adams became the second president of the United States in 1797, he inherited from George Washington a new experiment in government and a bit of a mess. The country’s two political parties – the Federalists and the Democratic-Republicans – were increasingly hostile to one another, and the young nation was sinking deeper into a foreign policy crisis with its onetime ally France.

Adams’ Federalist Party wanted to fight; the Democratic-Republicans did not. As the situation with France, caused by the seizure of American merchant ships, deteriorated, Adams had to prepare his country for war.

In an attempt to silence the Federalists’ political opponents, he signed the Sedition Act of 1798. The new law attempted to crack down on critical writings about government officials, and it was aimed at Democratic-Republican newspaper editors in particular.

Signing the Sedition Act was a reputation-ruining decision. This one act painted Adams as a man who put national security and his reputation above freedom of speech and the press. Yet the real story behind the Sedition Act, which I know from my work as a John Adams and American Revolution scholar, reveals a more complicated calculus.

At a time when the current presidential administration is tightening control of the media and even invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 – which Adams signed into law alongside the Sedition Act – it is important to understand this first attempt to control what kind of news the American people received.

Little choice but to sign

The Sedition Act made it illegal to “write, print, utter or publish … any false, scandalous and malicious” statements, particularly those that might “stir up sedition within the United States, or to excite any unlawful combinations therein, for opposing or resisting any law of the United States.”

It was one of four laws Congress passed in 1798 in an attempt to solve a perceived threat from the French and their supporters in the U.S. The other three acts affected immigrants, increasing residency requirements for citizenship from five to 14 years and giving the president broad authority to detain or deport “aliens” deemed dangerous.

Collectively, this legislation is known as the Alien and Sedition Acts. The Democratic-Republicans opposed the whole package as unconstitutional, but it was the Sedition Act that tainted Adams’ reputation.

I can’t let Adams off the hook for restricting freedom of the press, even temporarily – the Sedition Act expired in 1801 – but context is important.

While drafting the Bill of Rights two decades prior, James Madison and his congressional colleagues could not agree on the exact language for the First Amendment, which guarantees the rights to free speech and a free press. Between 1791, when it was adopted, and Adams’ signing of the laws in 1798, no court case had put those rights to the test and hashed out its meaning.

In 1798, the question was: Should there be restrictions on these rights, or should the press have free rein to print whatever it wanted?

Neither Congress nor Adams knew exactly how to interpret the First Amendment. The Supreme Court would not take up freedom of speech and the press until decades later, in 1821.

Reluctant decision in a crisis

My research and that of other scholars suggest that Adams was never an advocate of the Sedition Act. He neither asked for the legislation, nor did he lobby for it.

“I regret not the repeal of the Alien or Sedition Law, which were never favorites with me,” he told his son in later life.

He never indicated why he made the poor decision to sign the law. But he was acting in a time of crisis, and I suspect he felt he had no choice. The U.S. was preparing for war. The newly built USS Constitution was ready to set sail for the Caribbean to protect American merchant ships from French privateers.

The Sedition Act wouldn’t be the last time a fearful U.S. Congress preparing for war would try to silence opposition. In 1918, during World War I, Congress passed – and President Woodrow Wilson signed – a new Sedition Act that imposed harsh penalties for speech abusing the U.S. government, the flag, the Constitution or the military.

Because the Sedition Act was used to silence critical media, historians and free press advocates tend to take a dim view of it. Scholars have described the Alien and Sedition Acts as “reprehensible,” and many quote Thomas Jefferson, who feared they could mean the end of the republic.

“I consider these laws as merely an experiment on the American mind to see how far it will bear an avowed violation of the Constitution,” wrote Jefferson, who succeeded Adams in 1801.

“If this goes down, we shall immediately see attempted another act of Congress declaring that the President shall continue in office during life [and] reserving to another occasion the transfer of succession to his heirs,” Jefferson concluded.

Judges abuse the law

Ultimately, 10 people were convicted under the law, most of them Democratic-Republican newspaper editors. They were tried by Federalist judges who made no secret of their political alliances.

Chief among them was Samuel Chase, who presided over the trial of scandalmongering journalist James T. Callender. Callender was convicted of sedition and jailed in the spring of 1800.

During this and other trials, Chase abandoned all pretense of impartiality, openly siding with federal prosecutors.

“A republican government can only be destroyed in two ways,” Chase said during the 1800 sedition trial of writer Thomas Cooper, sounding more like a prosecutor than a judge. “The introduction of luxury, or the licentiousness of the press.”

Yet Chase was George Washington’s appointee. Adams could scarcely interfere with judicial independence, which was already a well-enshrined principle by the late 18th century.

The parameters of free speech, however, were still nebulous and untested. Indeed, “seditious libel” – speech that might undermine respect for the government or public officials – had long been outlawed under the English Common Law system, which the U.S. inherited.

Unlike British laws around free speech, the Sedition Act allowed truth as a defense.

“It shall be lawful for the defendant,” the law read, “to give in evidence in his defence, the truth of the matter contained in publication.”

In other words, critical press about public officials remained permissible in the U.S., so long as it was accurate. Seen in that light, the Federalists claimed the Sedition Act actually improved upon British Common Law.

Mixed record

Ultimately, Adams saved the U.S. from what would have been a disastrous war by pursuing peace negotiations with France. The Federalists were furious that Adams, in 1799, had sent a peace mission to France without consulting his party. But he chose peace with France rather than subject the American people to another war.

By doing this, he put country above party and sacrificed personal popularity for the common good. Adams’ other achievements as president include creating the Naval Department and establishing the Library of Congress.

And he made tremendous contributions to the independence of the U.S. as a Founding Father. He served in both Continental Congresses, got loans from the Dutch for the war effort and helped to shape the framework of government for the states.

The Alien and Sedition Acts were mistakes that Adams lived to regret. Reviving any of them today would be, in my opinion, a worse one.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,The fediverse promises social media without Big Tech – if it can avoid familiar pitfalls,https://theconversation.com/the-fediverse-promises-social-media-without-big-tech-if-it-can-avoid-familiar-pitfalls-247178,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 12:52:12 GMT","You’ve probably noticed lately that a lot of people are trying out alternatives to the big social media networks X, Instagram and Facebook. For example, after Elon Musk bought Twitter in 2022 and started allowing far more disinformation and hateful content on the site, renamed X, advertisers and users started backing away. More recently, Meta’s decision to roll back hate speech rules has prompted many people to consider leaving Instagram and Facebook.

Some of the most popular new destinations include “federated” services like Mastodon and Pixelfed, as well as the quasi-federated Bluesky. Federated means decentralized – rather than one central service, like X, federated systems have tens of thousands of servers. They also tend to be nonprofit and community-run.

Federated services, otherwise known as “the fediverse,” have been hailed as a network for public communication, dialogue and debate, where ordinary people, not corporations, shape their social spaces, and where advertisers, hate speech and intrusive algorithms are much easier to avoid. News organizations, nonprofits, universities and even governments have experimented with the fediverse and Bluesky, partially or even completely shifting their social media presence away from X.

However, as we, researchers who study media and communications, and our coauthors Thomas Struett and Patricia Aufderheide describe in a recently published paper, history provides numerous examples of other promising platforms for the digital public sphere that have died untimely deaths. We identified potential pitfalls from these examples and ways to avoid them.

We identified three such challenges: too many cooks, commercial capture and guilt by association.

Too many cooks

One nice thing about the big social media platforms is you know who’s in charge.

But instead of centralizing power like Meta or X, the fediverse has a distributed governance structure. While decentralized governance helps the fediverse avoid some of the pitfalls associated with the big social media platforms, like political censorship and surveillance capitalism, it introduces other risks that must be addressed before the fediverse can serve as a worthy replacement.

In short, when too many cooks are in charge, it’s hard to make a good meal. Take content moderation, for example. The fediverse offers great tools for blocking, and built-in codes of conduct, but these tools are specific to individual “instances” – the tens of thousands of fediverse servers. Who decides who gets blocked? With no central authority, governance is in the hands of fediverse members, who use hashtags like #fediblock to loosely coordinate. And that means people who are more likely to be harassed also end up having to do more of the work to prevent harassment.

Commercial capture

The fediverse, like email or the web itself, is open source. It was also developed with no input from the big social media platforms. But its origins won’t necessarily prevent the big platforms from taking over.

Look what happened to email, for instance. Once upon a time, there were thousands of different email providers. But today, nearly everyone is on Google’s Gmail and Microsoft’s Outlook, mostly because those companies added extra bells and whistles and sold email as a part of larger packages to employers, schools and other organizations.

This could easily happen again. Meta has already used fediverse protocols for its new microblogging service, Threads. While this helps Threads and Mastodon users to communicate, it also means Meta has a vested interest in shaping the technology’s future, in ways that might conflict with the hopes of today’s fediverse users — especially those who just fled Instagram and Facebook.

Guilt by association

While some social media companies might seek to capture the fediverse, others might seek to undermine its reputation by highlighting some of its unsavory uses. This has happened with several beneficial alternative technologies in the past, such as peer-to-peer file sharing, the dark web and end-to-end encryption.

The fediverse is already facing such challenges. In 2023, researchers at Stanford University published a report suggesting that child sexual abuse material can easily find a home on the fediverse. Couple this with claims from researchers that “toxic content is prevalent and spreads rapidly” across the fediverse, and a terrifying narrative emerges in which child sexual abuse material is spreading out of control.

Though this content could flourish in pockets of the fediverse, the scary scenario of prevalent child sexual abuse material is not the case. There are many moderation tools, including shared blocklists, that prevent it. However, the idea that the fediverse is full of harmful content was used by Elon Musk to justify his anti-competitive decision to block links from X to Mastodon.

Can these platforms survive?

We’re still bullish on the fediverse, and on Bluesky, if it manages to become a truly federated platform.

But democratized tech doesn’t guarantee democratic outcomes.

If these platforms are going to deliver on their promise, it’s important to learn from the mistakes of the past. That will mean users putting in the work to make sure they remain safe, accessible, noncommercial and well respected.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,How Jesse Jackson embodied Southern politics − and changed American elections,https://theconversation.com/how-jesse-jackson-embodied-southern-politics-and-changed-american-elections-247435,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 12:50:32 GMT","Holding hands with other prominent Black leaders, the Rev. Jesse Jackson crossed the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma, Alabama, on March 9, 2025, to commemorate the 60th anniversary of “Bloody Sunday.” Like several survivors of that violent day in 1965, when police brutally attacked civil rights protesters, Jackson crossed the bridge in a wheelchair.

Jesse Louis Jackson was born Oct. 8, 1941, in Greenville, South Carolina, a town firmly entrenched in the racially segregated Deep South. This time and place aren’t footnotes to Jackson’s life, but rather key facts that shaped his civil rights activism and historic runs for the U.S. presidency.

Growing up in the segregated South shaped Jackson’s attitudes, opinions and outlook in ways that remain apparent today. While he lived in Chicago for most of his adult life, he remained a Southerner. And other Southerners viewed him as such.

Jackson biographer David Masciotra said the South gave Jackson “a sense of the oppression and the persecution that he wanted to fight.”

As scholars of Southern politics, we see Jackson’s Southern identity as essential to understanding his life. Southerners often identify with the region, even after leaving the geographic South. As sociologist John Shelton Reed once wrote, Southernness has more to do with attitude than latitude.

A segregated childhood

In the South Carolina of Jackson’s youth, water fountains, bathrooms, swimming pools and lunch counters were all segregated. While white people his age attended Greenville High School, Jackson attended the all-Black Sterling High School, where he was a star quarterback and class president.

His experience of segregation shaped how Jackson views his life.

“I keep thinking about the odds,” Jackson told his biographer and fellow South Carolinian Marshall Frady in 1988, marveling at the “responsibility I have now against what I was expected then to be doing at this stage of life.”

“Even mean ole segregation couldn’t break in on me and steal my soul,” he later told Frady.

If Jackson had been white, a star student like him might have enrolled at Clemson University or the University of South Carolina. Or he might have said yes when he was offered a contract to play professional baseball.

Instead, Jackson rejected the contract because the pay would be approximately six times less than a white player’s and went North, to the University of Illinois.

He did not find a more welcoming atmosphere in Champaign, Illinois. According to biographer Barbara Reynolds, the segregation that he thought he had left behind “cropped up in Illinois to convince him that was not the place to be.”

In the fall of 1960, Jackson transferred to North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, a historically Black college in Greensboro, North Carolina, to complete his sociology degree.

His return to the South marked Jackson’s emergence as a leader in the growing Civil Rights Movement.

Greensboro was a center of this struggle, with large, regular demonstrations, often led by local students of color. Six months prior to his arrival in Greensboro, four Black students from North Carolina A&T refused to leave the whites-only Woolworth lunch counter, launching a sit-in movement that soon drew national attention.

Jackson himself led protests to integrate Greensboro businesses. After one pivotal student march on City Hall, he was arrested and charged with inciting a riot. In jail, Jackson wrote a “Letter From a Greensboro Jail,” a rhetorical tip of the hat to Martin Luther King Jr.’s “Letter from a Birmingham Jail.”

A move north

Jackson’s second move north, in 1964, stuck.

Like so many other Black Southerners who participated in what later became known as the “second great migration,” Jackson went to Chicago. He attended Chicago Theological Seminary, inspired not by a deep love of scripture but by what Jackson perceived as the church’s ability to do good on this earth.

As North Carolina A&T’s president, Dr. Sam Proctor, advised Jackson, “You don’t have to enter the ministry because you want to save people from a burning hell. It may be because you want to see his kingdom come on earth as it is in heaven.”

Jackson thought his time in Chicago “would be quiet and peaceful and I could reflect.”

It was anything but. Following the path of King and other religiously inspired civil rights activists, Jackson continued his civil rights organizing, leading Operation Breadbasket, an initiative of King’s to boycott businesses that did not employ Black workers.

Presidential aspirations

Over the next few years, Jackson took on ever more high-profile organizing, patterned after the life and work of King – another Southerner. As the former King aide Bernard Lafayette once said, “I mean, he cloned himself out of Martin Luther King.”

In 1984, Jackson turned to politics. He became the second African American to run for the nation’s highest office, following in the footsteps of Shirley Chisholm and her 1972 candidacy.

Announcing his bid, Jackson pledged to “help restore a moral tone, a redemptive spirit, and a sensitivity to the poor and dispossessed of this nation.”

But the campaign always represented more than a policy platform. Jackson wanted to mobilize more Americans to vote and to run for office, especially the “voiceless and the downtrodden.”

Jackson finished third in the 1984 Democratic primary but with a remarkably strong showing, taking 18% of all primary votes. He performed especially well south of the Mason-Dixon Line, winning both Louisiana and the District of Columbia. He also performed well in the Mississippi and South Carolina Democratic caucuses.

This surprising success inspired Jackson to run for president again. In 1988, he did even better, winning nearly 7 million votes and 11 contests, and sweeping the South during the primary season.

He won the South Carolina caucuses and the Super Tuesday states of Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and Virgina. In his second run, Jackson more than doubled his share of the white vote, from 5% in 1984 to 12% in 1988.

Jackson finished second in the Democratic primary to Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, who would go on to lose the 1988 presidential election to George H.W. Bush. But Jackson’s strong results solidified his position as a major figure in American politics and a power broker in the Democratic Party.

A towering figure in American politics

Jesse Jackson’s two presidential runs fundamentally altered the U.S. political landscape.

Beyond being the first Black candidate to win a state primary contest, Jackson also helped end the primary system by which the winner of a state would receive all the state’s delegates. Jackson claimed the system hurt Black and minority candidates and advocated to implement reforms that had been first recommended following the 1968 Democratic primary.

Back then, the party had pushed for a system in which delegates could be allocated based on the proportion of the vote won by each candidate, but it wasn’t adopted in every state.

Starting in 1992, following Jackson’s intervention, candidates receiving at least 15% of the vote officially received a proportion of the delegates. These reforms opened up the possibility that a minority candidate could secure the Democratic nomination through a more proportional allocation of delegates.

Jackson’s background also reinforced the importance of the Black church in Black political mobilization.

Perhaps most importantly, Jackson expanded the size and diversity of the electorate and inspired a generation of African Americans to seek office.

“It is because people like Jesse ran that I have this opportunity to run for president today,” said Barack Obama in 2007.

The long Southern strategy

Jackson’s political rise coincided with and likely encouraged the exodus of racially conservative white voters out of the Democratic Party.

The Republican Party’s Long Southern Strategy – an opportunistic plan to cultivate Southern white voters by capitalizing on “white racial angst” and conservative social values – had been underway before Jackson’s presidential bids. But his focus on social and economic justice undoubtedly helped drive conservative Southern whites to the GOP.

Today, some political thinkers question whether a distinct “Southern politics” continues to exist.

The life and career of Jesse Jackson reflect that place still matters – even for people who have left that region for colder pastures.",theconversation

S’il y a quelque chose qui est cassé au sein de nos démocraties, c’est le lien de confiance qui a existé pendant les quatre-vingts dernières années entre les États-Unis et les pays s’identifiant à la civilisation dite occidentale. Cette nouvelle ère politique exigera un très haut niveau de mobilisation pour défendre les principes à la base même du droit international, de la protection des droits de la personne et des valeurs démocratiques.

L’arrivée au pouvoir de Trump et de ses acolytes doit sonner le rassemblement des esprits les plus éclairés, pour contrer l’avènement d’un monde sans règle où seuls les rapports de force dicteraient le cours de l’histoire et au sein duquel le principe démocratique serait bafoué.

En tant que spécialiste de la politique québécoise et canadienne et plus spécifiquement des études fédérales et des systèmes partisans, je crois que nous sommes confrontés à une situation inédite. Comment en est-on arrivé là ? Comment réagir face à une telle situation ?

Le silence des Démocrates

Au moment où les rapports de pouvoir sont en plein chambardement, il faut tout d’abord souligner le silence des démocrates américains.

Les anciens présidents démocrates Joe Biden, Bill Clinton et Barack Obama n’interviennent tout simplement pas dans les débats publics. Pourquoi se taisent-ils ? Qu’en est-il aussi des vingt-trois gouverneurs démocrates ? C’est le silence là aussi. Les Républicains ont la voie libre pour agir à leur guise.

(Chip Somodevilla/Pool Photo via AP)

Dans son livre Les routes de la la liberté, publié en anglais en 2024, Joseph Stiglitz,ancien professeur d’économie à l’Université Columbia (qui vient de se voir couper 400 millions de dollars d’aide fédérale par Trump) et Prix Nobel de l’Économie, rappelle qu’aux États-Unis, démocrates et républicains défendent tous les deux les principes à la base même du néolibéralisme.

Ces deux grandes familles politiques s’entendent lorsqu’il est question de dérégulation, de privatisation et de commerce international.

Lorsque les démocrates sont au pouvoir, de peur de perdre l’appui d’une majorité d’électeurs, ils se contentent de faire des changements souvent à la marge et conservent aux plus riches leurs privilèges. Cela a d’ailleurs valu à l’automne 2023 à la première administration Trump et à l’administration Biden des critiques acerbes du Comité des droits humains des Nations-Unies, qui y a vu de nombreux manquements aux droits humains de la part de ces deux administrations.

En somme, c’est la cupidité qui dicte les règles du jeu politique. Plus les démocrates se sont montrés conciliants avec le grand capital, plus ils ont contribué à donner de la crédibilité aux velléités républicaines. On glisse ainsi du règne des oligarques à celui des oligarques plus. C’est l’accumulation des richesses pour un nombre de plus en plus infime de personnes qui prévaut au détriment de l’ensemble de la population.

L’Organisation des Nations unies dénonce la situation

La sortie publique de trente-deux experts de l’Organisation des Nations unies (ONU), le 27 février, est un indice que ces bouleversements ne passent pas inaperçus. Dans une lettre ouverte, les signataires, qui proviennent d’horizons divers, constatent un assaut sans précédent contre les institutions internationales, la règle de droit, le principe du multilatéralisme et la souveraineté étatique.

Ils notent aussi des actions illégales en vue de mettre à mal le droit international et le respect de l’intégrité territoriale des États. La Charte des Nations-Unies interdit toute menace ou usage de la force pouvant menacer l’indépendance politique des États. Les experts relèvent la menace d’une prise de possession du canal de Panama, l’expulsion des Palestiniens de Gaza et la propriété de ce territoire et la prise de contrôle des ressources du Groenland « d’une façon ou d’une autre ». Ils précisent que chacune de ces actions est condamnable et doit cesser immédiatement, sinon c’est le régime démocratique de l’après-guerre qui est menacé de disparaître.

Tous les efforts réalisés dans le sillage de la Deuxième Guerre mondiale ne doivent pas être effacés par la cupidité d’acteurs qui ne souhaitent que leur enrichissement personnel aux dépens de ceux qui ont le plus besoin de l’aide de l’État.

Le devoir de résistance

Au moment où l’ordre mondial est menacé, il faut imaginer des actions responsables en vue de contrer les forces qui se mettent en place.

À l’image des experts des Nations-Unies, il importe de sensibiliser la population aux risques que la présidence Trump fait courir à la stabilité internationale. Plusieurs chefs d’État et de gouvernement, de même que le Secrétaire général de l’ONU, António Guterres, ont rapidement exprimé leur déception et leur incompréhension face à l’annonce faite de mettre fin au programme d’aide américaine USAID. Ces mêmes États devraient dès maintenant s’entendre pour mutualiser leurs ressources dans le but de combler ce vide. Cette aide est essentielle au bien-être des populations les plus fragiles et à la santé publique dans son ensemble.

Cette même mutualisation des ressources doit aussi pouvoir être reproduite dans divers secteurs d’activité touchant les réseaux d’information, la sécurité des États et de leurs populations, la protection des groupes en situation de fragilité et la liberté de la presse.

La tenue le 2 mars à Londres du sommet Securing our Future sur la sécurité constitue un pas très important dans le redéploiement de l’alliance atlantique.

Le Canada et la troisième option

Le Canada n’a d’autre choix que de redéployer graduellement son économie sur une base est-ouest et diversifier ses sources d’importation et ses marchés d’exportation. L’Europe, l’Asie et les pays de l’Amérique du Sud sont les endroits les plus naturels vers lesquels se tourner alors que le partenaire américain est plus imprévisible que jamais.

L’idée de la troisième option, avancée par le gouvernement de Pierre Trudeau il y a déjà un demi-siècle, ne peut être plus d’actualité que maintenant.

En 1972, le secrétaire d’État aux Affaires extérieures Mitchell Sharp souhaitait réduire l’influence économique et culturelle des États-Unis sur le Canada. Il rejetait deux options : l’une, de maintenir le statu quo et l’autre, d’adopter une politique d’intégration plus étroite avec les États-Unis.

https://theconversation.com,Curious Kids: what was the biggest dinosaur that ever lived?,https://theconversation.com/curious-kids-what-was-the-biggest-dinosaur-that-ever-lived-250885,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 21:35:05 GMT","What actually was the biggest dinosaur?

– Zavier, 14, Tauranga, New Zealand.

Great question Zavier, and one that palaeontologists (scientists who study fossil animals and plants) are interested in all around the world.

And let’s face it, kids of all ages (and I include adults here) are fascinated by dinosaurs that break records for the biggest, the longest, the scariest or the fastest. It’s why, to this day, one of most famous dinosaurs is still Tyranosaurus rex, the tyrant king.

These record-breaking dinosaurs are part of the reason why the Jurassic Park movie franchise has been so successful. Just think of the scene where Dr Alan Grant (played by New Zealand actor Sam Neill) is stunned by the giant sauropod dinosaur rearing up to reach the highest leaves in the tree with its long neck.

But how do scientists work out how big and heavy a dinosaur was? And what were the biggest dinosaurs that ever lived?

Calculating dinosaur size

In an ideal world, calculating how big a dinosaur was would be easy – with a nearly complete skeleton. Standing next to the remarkable Triceratops skeleton on permanent display at Melbourne Museum makes you realise how gigantic and formidable these creatures were.

By measuring bone proportions (such as length, width or circumference) and plugging them into mathematical formulas and computer models, scientists can compare the measurements to those of living animals. They can then work out the likely size and weight of dinosaurs.

Every palaeontologist has their own favourite formula or computer model. Some are more accurate than others, which can lead to heated arguments!

In palaeontology, however, we are not always blessed with nearly complete skeletons. In a process called “taphonomy” – basically, what happens to the bones after an animal dies – dinosaur skeletons can be broken up and bones lost.

The more fragmented the remains of a dinosaur are, the more error is introduced into size and weight estimates.

Enter the titanosaurs

If we could travel back in time to South America during the Cretaceous period (about 143 million to 66 million years ago), we’d find a land ruled by a group of four-legged, long-necked and long-tailed, plant-eating sauropods. They would have towered over us, and the ground would shake with every step they took.

These were the titanosaurs. They reached their largest sizes during this period, before an asteroid crashed into what is now modern day Mexico 66 million years ago, making them extinct.

There are several contenders among the titanosaurs for the biggest dinosaur ever. Even the list below is controversial, with my palaeontology students pointing out several other possible contenders.

But based on six partial skeletons, the best estimate is for Patagotitan, which is thought to have been 31 meters long and to have weighed 50–57 tonnes.

A couple of others might have been as big or even bigger. Argentinosaurus has been calculated to be longer and heavier at 30–35 metres and 65–80 tonnes. And Puertasaurus was thought to be around 30 metres long and 50 tonnes.

But while the available bones of Argentinosaurus and Puertasaursus suggest reptiles of colossal size (the complete thigh bone of Argentinosaurus is 2.5 metres long!), there is currently not enough fossil material to be confident of those estimates.

Spinosaurus rules North Africa

An ocean away from South America’s titanosaurs, Spinosaurus lived in what is now North Africa during the Cretaceous period.

By a very small margin, Spinosaurus is currently thought to have been the largest carnivorous (meat-eating) dinosaur, weighing in at 7.4 tonnes and 14 meters long. Other Cretaceous giants are right up there, too, including Tyranosaurus rex from North America, Gigantosaurus from South America, and Carcharodontosaurus from North Africa.

Spinosaurus is unique among predatory dinosaurs in that it was semi-aquatic and had adapted to eating fish. You can see in the picture above how similar its skull shape was to a modern crocodile.

Palaeontology is now more popular than ever – maybe because of the ongoing Jurassic Park series – with a fossil “gold rush” occurring in the Southern Hemisphere.

Members of the public (known as “fossil forecasters”) are making new discoveries all the time.

So, who knows? The next discovery might turn out to be a new record holder as the biggest or longest dinosaur to have ever lived. There can be only one!

https://theconversation.com,‘Shoot it like Steph’: why young athletes shouldn’t try to copy the world’s best,https://theconversation.com/shoot-it-like-steph-why-young-athletes-shouldnt-try-to-copy-the-worlds-best-250619,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 02:42:35 GMT","For decades, sport coaching has been built on the idea that there is one correct way to perform a skill.

This has often been referred to as a gold standard technique that every athlete should replicate.

Whether it is basketball players trying to shoot like Steph Curry or Caitlin Clark or a runner attempting to sprint like Noah Lyles, aspiring athletes have generally been encouraged to copy the techniques of their heroes.

But research in biomechanics and motor learning suggests this approach may be misguided.

Is there an ‘optimal’ technique?

Traditional coaching has lent on the work of sports biomechanists to discover the “optimal” technique for skills in various sport disciplines.

These techniques, usually developed based on “averages” of what elite level athletes do, are used by sport coaches as the template against which all other athletes are measured.

That is, if we can replicate the technique of a higher-performing athlete, success will follow.

However, this approach ignores a crucial reality: no two athletes are built the same.

Every athlete has unique physical characteristics. Whether it is hand size, limb length, physical strength, running gait or neuromuscular coordination, they all contribute to how an athlete expresses their individual “movement signature”.

Forcing athletes to copy the technical features of the best athlete in the world may be unachievable.

The quick release, high arc shooting style of Curry has turned him into the leading three-point shooter in NBA history. But it is his unique expression of movement and his individual technique that allows him to knock them down from the logo (near half-way).

Yet, other long-range sharpshooters such as Luka Dončić (LA Lakers) and Kevin Durant (Phoenix Suns) have their own variation of shooting technique, which achieves the same thing: putting the ball in the basket.

If we forced them both to shoot like Curry, this variation would likely detract from their techniques and their shooting performance would almost certainly decline.

Variability is important

It is the “variability” in technique at the elite level of sport where the myth of a single optimal technique begins to unravel.

Many coaches have traditionally viewed deviations from what is considered optimal technique as an error, but researchers suggest movement variability – a concept that explains the natural changes in technique – is a normal part of skilled performance.

So, if elite athletes display a natural variation performing the same skill, even after years of training, why do we encourage our aspiring athletes to eliminate it?

And this variability is not exclusive to basketball.

For example, in sprinting, the top speed technique of Lyles, the Olympic 100m champion, is built on a powerful piston action of the legs and aggressive arm drive, which differs to that of rising Australian sprint star Gout Gout, whose technique relies on a more fluid stride pattern where he almost appears to be bouncing down the track.

The variation in Gout’s technique compared to that of Lyles’ is not a flaw, but a unique solution to the same movement challenge: maximising speed.

Read more: 'Pressure makes diamonds': how Australian sprint sensation Gout Gout can get even faster

Interestingly, a recent systematic review suggests movement variability is essential for athletes who need to adapt their existing technique to different environments or physiological conditions such as fatigue.

Consider a recent “buzzer-beater” by Curry, where he wrapped the ball behind his back before swishing a fade-away basket.

This is not a technique which has been engineered by focusing on what’s deemed optimal. It is exploiting the variability which lies within the athlete’s possible solutions.

If there is only one optimal technique in this situation, the highlight reel never emerges.

Lessons for coaches and athletes

So, what is the way forward for sport coaches?

Encourage athletes to explore a variety of techniques and discover what works best for them, based on their unique characteristics.

But it also relies on the coach placing the athlete in situations where they can be creative and expand their movement bandwidth.

This is not to say coaches should let athletes perform a series of random movements and expect good technique to just happen.

There remain key performance indicators for all skills which adhere to biomechanical principles of efficient and effective movement.

But these indicators sit on a continuum – they are not fixed.

Elite sport simply offers insight into the techniques of top performers, not a defining set of movement criteria essential to specific sport skills.

For sport coaches, the goal is not to develop athletes based on a rigid technical model of one size fits all, but rather for athletes to develop a technique that aligns with their own strengths and physical characteristics.

So the next time someone says “just shoot it like Steph or Catilin”, reconsider it and find a way to shoot it how it feels best.

This is where true mastery begins.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,Terapia pet: estudos reforçam importância do acesso de bichos de estimação a serviços públicos de saúde,https://theconversation.com/terapia-pet-estudos-reforcam-importancia-do-acesso-de-bichos-de-estimacao-a-servicos-publicos-de-saude-251868,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 06:21:57 GMT","Seja em casa ou na rua, muita gente concorda que a presença de pets deixa qualquer ambiente mais leve e descontraído, e cria mais abertura para interações sociais. Agora, imagine trazer essa sensação de acolhimento para o ambiente da Saúde, onde frequentemente prevalecem tensão e preocupações.

Iniciativas pet-friendly na rede pública de saúde ainda são pouco comuns, e geralmente se estendem apenas a pacientes internados em hospitais. Porém no Brasil elas estão alinhadas com as diretrizes da Política Nacional de Humanização (PNH), que busca oferecer um atendimento mais humanizado e inclusivo à população.

Pesquisas indicam que a interação com animais de estimação pode promover saúde mental. Em linha com tais pesquisas, permitir pets em hospitais e clínicas de saúde é uma ideia promissora e que pode resultar em melhor saúde física e mental de adultos e crianças. No entanto, ainda temos um longo caminho pela frente e desafios complexos a serem debatidos.

A relevância da implementação de práticas pet-friendly na saúde

O Brasil tem a terceira maior população pet do mundo. Além disso, alguns tutores afirmam que amam mais seus pets do que membros da família. Com a evidente importância dos animais de estimação, é crucial que o sistema de saúde se ajuste às necessidades da população. Isso significa valorizar o papel emocional dos pets na vida das pessoas e ampliar o debate sobre espaços pet-friendly em diversos contextos, incluindo em serviços de saúde.

Apesar dos desafios inerentes à implementação de políticas pet-friendly em ambientes hospitalares, pesquisas sugerem que essa ideia pode ter sim um impacto positivo. Pois seria capaz de:

1. Encorajar a adesão ao tratamento:

Abordagens que incluam a possibilidade de trazer o pet ao atendimento podem derrubar barreiras que impedem algumas populações de buscar suporte médico e psicológico. Por exemplo, pessoas com graves transtornos psicológicos, e/ou donos de pets em situação de rua muitas vezes enfrentam no dificuldade no acesso aos serviços médicos e psicológicosquando isso significa se separar de seus pets. Isso pode reduzir o acesso à saúde para populações vulneráveis. Portanto, é fundamental ajustar os serviços de saúde às demandas dessas populações.

2. Reduzir o estresse de pacientes e equipe de saúde:

Incluir animais em clínicas e hospitais pode humanizar o ambiente, facilitar a comunicação, e amenizar o estresse tanto de pacientes quanto de profissionais da Saúde.Para os profissionais, o resultado é a redução de burnout. Além disso, para os pacientes a interação com animais oferece conforto emocional e uma distração de preocupações, o que pode resultar em maior adesão ao tratamento.

3. Melhorar a comunicação entre paciente e equipe de saúde:

O simples fato de falar com o paciente sobre o seu pet pode melhorar a comunicação entre ele e a equipe de saúde. As pessoas simplesmente se sentem mais à vontade quando são questionadas sobre esse importante vínculo. Ao criar mais políticas pet-friendly, esse tipo de diálogo pode ser potencializado o que pode gerar mais sensação de confiança no relacionamento com os profissionais de saúde.

Desafios e potenciais riscos

Embora os benefícios sejam evidentes, a adoção de políticas pet-friendly na saúde ainda é limitada, em parte devido às preocupações com os riscos de transmissão de doenças.

De fato, aspectos logísticos envolvendo a higiene e segurançasão aspectos importantes nesse debate. Ao mesmo tempo, com adequados protocolos de saúde os riscos oferecidos pela presença de pets podem não ser maiores que aqueles associados às visitas de familiares em ambientes hospitalares. Essa foi a conclusão do Juravinski Hospital no Canadá, que desenvolve um programa que permite a visita de pets a pacientes internados. Em outras palavras, os riscos existem, mas podem ser reduzidos com protocolos apropriados, como apontado em alguns estudos.

Seguindo essa lógica, em cidades brasileiras como São Paulo por exemplo, embora apenas em hospitais, a visita de pets já é regulamentada e segue protocolos claros.

Para controle de bactérias, cuidados com o pelo e higiene do animal devem ser garantidos, assim como o monitoramento das visitas por profissionais de saúde. É possível minimizar riscos com informações claras sobre em que áreas especificas o animal pode circular e com quem pode interagir. Outra medida necessária é a exigência de laudo veterinário atestando a saúde do animal.

A vasta maioria dos profissionais que já interagiram com animais em ambientes da saúde, reconhece os benefícios dessa interação. Mas o preparo da equipe de saúde é igualmente relevante. Eles precisam se sentir confortáveis para lidar com pets no ambiente de trabalho. Portanto, tais políticas devem ser construídas em colaboração com profissionais da área. Isso pode garantir que o manejo de situações especificas como fobia de animais e alergias sejam colocadas na balança e adequadamente respeitadas.

Questões comportamentaistambém devem ser consideradas para que a presença do pet não cause transtorno para outros pacientes ou profissionais. Sem tais cuidados, políticas pet-friendly não conseguirão alcançar seu objetivo que é promover saúde física e mental e tornar serviços de saúde mais inclusivos e acolhedores.

O reconhecimento desses desafios é, portanto, fundamental, e serve para ajudar na elaboração de propostas pet-friendly que de fato sejam viáveis e benéficas para todos os envolvidos.

Ampliando horizontes

A abordagem “One Health” (Uma Só Saúde) reconhece a conexão entre a saúde humana, animal, vegetal e ambiental. Com base nesse conceito, considerar a presença de pets na rede de saúde é mais que uma forma de promover conforto emocional, é uma ideia alinhada com uma visão mais integrada da saúde.

Com a adaptação de protocolos, treinamento de equipe e participação ativa dos profissionais, podemos transformar serviços de saúde e torná-los mais acessíveis e abertos aos pets.

Essa abordagem cria um ambiente acolhedor, ajudando a melhorar a qualidade dos cuidados oferecido à população. O objetive final é aplicar o que sabemos sobre pets par construir propostas mais holísticas, e alinhadas com as diretrizes de saúde no Brasil.",theconversation

No entanto, a região enfrenta pressões crescentes, como desmatamento, degradação ambiental e mudanças climáticas, que ameaçam seus ecossistemas e as populações tradicionais que dependem deles.

Essas comunidades, incluindo indígenas, quilombolas e ribeirinhos, possuem um conhecimento profundo sobre o ambiente amazônico, desenvolvendo e aprimorando práticas sustentáveis ao longo de gerações. Ainda assim, suas vozes e perspectivas são frequentemente negligenciadas nos debates globais sobre a região.

A 30ª edição da Conferência da ONU sobre Mudanças Climáticas (COP 30) será realizada em novembro desse ano em Belém, no coração da Amazônia, e representa uma oportunidade única para reverter esse cenário, promovendo a integração entre saberes científicos e tradicionais na busca por soluções sustentáveis.

Ciência amazônica

A eficácia da pesquisa científica na Amazônia é significativamente amplificada quando conduzida por cientistas que vivem e trabalham na região. Esse conhecimento endógeno, forjado na interação contínua com as complexidades ecológicas, sociais e econômicas locais, permite a formulação de questões de pesquisa mais precisas e relevantes, resultando em soluções aplicáveis e eficazes.

Durante a pandemia de Covid-19, por exemplo, pesquisadores de instituições amazônicas — como as Universidades Federais do Pará (UFPA), do Acre (UFAC) e do Sul e Sudeste do Pará (Unifesspa) — lideraram estudos sobre os impactos da doença em comunidades indígenas e ribeirinhas, adaptando estratégias de saúde pública às realidades locais. Essa abordagem contextualizada demonstra a importância da proximidade com o território para identificar e responder a problemas emergentes de maneira ágil.

Além disso, a conexão direta com as comunidades locais permite uma abordagem participativa na pesquisa, envolvendo povos tradicionais e populações urbanas no processo de produção de conhecimento. Projetos concebidos a partir da realidade amazônica promovem o empoderamento das comunidades, a conservação da biodiversidade e o fortalecimento do conhecimento científico, redefinindo as fronteiras entre ação climática e responsabilidade social.

Essa abordagem contrasta com modelos externos que frequentemente extraem dados da região sem garantir que os resultados beneficiem as populações locais, e, muitas vezes, relegam pesquisadores e instituições amazônicos ao papel de meros coletores de dados, em vez de protagonistas no desenvolvimento científico.

Conhecimento integrado

A pesquisa endógena na Amazônia também se destaca pela integração dos saberes tradicionais, que são fundamentais para a preservação de ecossistemas e recursos naturais. As práticas ecológicas dos povos tradicionais, baseadas em conhecimentos ancestrais, contribuem para a resiliência social e ecológica da região.

A inclusão desses saberes nos processos de pesquisa e tomada de decisão é crucial para mitigar a crise climática e garantir o uso sustentável dos recursos naturais. Estudos científicos rigorosos têm demonstrado que o conhecimento ecológico tradicional e as práticas sociais são essenciais para a conservação da biodiversidade e a manutenção dos serviços ecossistêmicos.

Nesse contexto, o Centro Integrado da Sociobiodiversidade da Amazônia (CISAM), que reúne até o momento 13 universidades federais da região, emerge como uma iniciativa estratégica para fortalecer a capacidade intelectual e técnica da Amazônia.

O CISAM promove pesquisas interdisciplinares e fomenta a coprodução de soluções socioambientais, com a participação ativa da sociedade local. Investir na ciência produzida na Amazônia por cientistas da Amazônia é uma estratégia fundamental para garantir que o conhecimento gerado resulte em transformações concretas para a sustentabilidade ambiental e o bem-estar das populações da região.

Vozes amazônicas na COP 30

A COP 30 representa uma oportunidade histórica para amplificar as vozes amazônicas nos debates globais sobre clima e meio ambiente. O movimento “Ciência e Vozes da Amazônia na COP 30”, lançado em fevereiro pela Universidade Federal do Pará (UFPA), a maior instituição científica da Pan-Amazônia, busca consolidar, sistematizar e divulgar ações científicas e socioambientais desenvolvidas pela comunidade da região.

Essa iniciativa visa garantir que as perspectivas locais sejam centrais nas discussões sobre mudanças climáticas, destacando a Amazônia como um laboratório vivo de soluções sustentáveis.

O movimento enfatiza a necessidade de uma governança territorial centrada nas pessoas e na natureza, reconhecendo a integridade dos territórios dos povos e comunidades tradicionais como elemento indispensável para a proteção da sociobiodiversidade e a redução do desmatamento.

A integração de saberes científicos e tradicionais, aliada a essa governança centrada nas pessoas, nos territórios e na natureza, é fundamental para construir soluções sustentáveis que beneficiem tanto a Amazônia quanto o mundo.

Além disso, o movimento busca colocar temas críticos no centro das discussões, como por exemplo a contaminação por mercúrio, que tem graves consequências para a saúde pública e os ecossistemas. A inclusão de temas pouco visibilizados nas agendas globais — como esse e outros que sobressaem a partir da vivência local — é imprescindível para enfrentar, de maneira integrada e eficaz, os desafios ambientais e sociais da Amazônia.

A participação ativa das instituições da região na COP 30 é uma oportunidade para influenciar diretamente as negociações internacionais. O movimento “Ciência e Vozes da Amazônia na COP-30” representa, portanto, um chamado essencial para a inclusão e o protagonismo amazônico, reconhecendo que o futuro do planeta passa pela Amazônia e pelas pessoas e instituições de pesquisa que atuam na região.

A realização da COP 30 em Belém é uma oportunidade única para amplificar essas vozes e garantir que a Amazônia ocupe o lugar central que merece na agenda climática internacional.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,Vencendo o desafio do nascimento: vidas de milhões de bebês podem mudar com simples teste do cordão umbilical,https://theconversation.com/vencendo-o-desafio-do-nascimento-vidas-de-milhoes-de-bebes-podem-mudar-com-simples-teste-do-cordao-umbilical-252158,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 06:22:08 GMT","O nascimento é um dos momentos mais críticos na vida de uma pessoa. Durante este momento, o bebê deixa de receber oxigênio pelo cordão umbilical e passa a respirar por conta própria. Na maioria das vezes, essa transição ocorre sem problemas, mas quando algo dá errado, as consequências podem ser devastadoras.

Estudamos mais de 35 mil bebês nascidos na Suécia entre 1997 e 2012, acompanhando seus prontuários de saúde por até 20 anos. Descobrimos que os bebês com pH do cordão umbilical abaixo de 7,05 (sugerindo que não receberam oxigênio suficiente durante o parto) enfrentaram um risco maior de morte e deficiências nas duas primeiras décadas de vida.

Se a privação de oxigênio (conhecida como “acidemia neonatal”) durar muito tempo, ela pode causar danos duradouros ao cérebro e a outros órgãos - e até mesmo a morte. Em todo o mundo, mais de um milhão de bebês morrem a cada ano devido à privação de oxigênio no nascimento.

Um teste simples e indolor - a amostragem do sangue do cordão umbilical - pode verificar os níveis de ácido (pH) para revelar como o bebê lidou com o nascimento. Um pH baixo no cordão umbilical indica uma escassez significativa de oxigênio durante o nascimento, o que pode levar a uma série de complicações. No entanto, em todo o mundo, os médicos não chegam a um acordo sobre qual valor de pH do cordão umbilical é considerado anormal.

Em países como a Suécia e a Noruega, um pH do cordão umbilical inferior a 7,05 é geralmente considerado anormal, refletindo uma abordagem mais cautelosa, enquanto outros países podem definir o limite de pH em 7,00 ou menos para desencadear uma intervenção médica adicional. Essas diferenças nas diretrizes podem afetar profundamente o momento das intervenções e o tratamento de recém-nascidos que sofrem de acidemia ao nascer.

Em nosso estudo, o risco de paralisia cerebral (um distúrbio que afeta os movimentos e a coordenação) foi quatro vezes maior em bebês nascidos com pH do cordão umbilical abaixo de 7,05 em comparação com bebês nascidos com pH do cordão umbilical acima de 7,05. Da mesma forma, a epilepsia (uma condição neurológica que causa convulsões) foi quase duas vezes mais provável em bebês nascidos com um pH do cordão umbilical de 7,05. O risco de deficiências intelectuais também foi mais comum, mas somente quando o pH do cordão umbilical era mais baixo (pH 6,95).

Nosso estudo estabeleceu uma conexão clara entre acidemia no nascimento e problemas neurológicos de longo prazo. E quanto menor o pH do cordão umbilical, maior o risco.

O cérebro é altamente sensível à flutuação dos níveis de oxigênio no sangue. Os neurônios, as principais células de comunicação do cérebro, são particularmente vulneráveis. Se privadas de oxigênio, estas células podem sofrer danos ou morrer, afetando os movimentos, a memória e a função cognitiva.

As áreas cerebrais normalmente afetadas incluem o córtex motor, que controla o movimento e está ligado à paralisia cerebral; o hipocampo, essencial para a memória e o aprendizado; e os gânglios basais, que regulam o movimento e podem ser danificados em bebês com privação de oxigênio.

Tratamento rápido pode evitar problemas por toda vida

Se houver suspeita de falta de oxigênio em um recém-nascido, a equipe de saúde pode coletar amostras do pH do cordão umbilical imediatamente. Em minutos, eles podem diagnosticar se o pH do cordão umbilical do bebê está anormal, permitindo uma intervenção médica oportuna que pode salvar o bebê de danos cerebrais de longo prazo e até mesmo da morte.

A hipotermia terapêutica, ou terapia de resfriamento, tem se mostrado promissora na redução de danos cerebrais quando aplicada durante as primeiras horas após o nascimento. O resfriamento do bebê ajuda a desacelerar o metabolismo do cérebro, dando-lhe tempo para se recuperar. A equipe médica geralmente resfria o bebê a cerca de 33,5°C por aproximadamente 72 horas antes de aquecê-lo novamente de forma gradual.

Pesquisadores continuam a explorar novos tratamentos para proteger bebês de danos cerebrais de longo prazo.

Reconhecer o efeito dos níveis de oxigênio no nascimento é uma necessidade médica, e um simples exame de sangue pode nos fornecer essa informação.

A coleta de amostras do pH do cordão umbilical deve ser uma rotina em todas as maternidades, pois esse exame fornece um retrato da saúde do bebê ao nascer. Ao melhorar os cuidados com os recém-nascidos e as práticas médicas, podemos ajudar cada criança a ter a chance de uma vida melhor, livre de deficiências evitáveis.",theconversation

Depois de nove horas de negociações a portas fechadas em Jedá, na Arábia Saudita, os negociadores aprovaram uma proposta dos EUA para um cessar-fogo de 30 dias, permitindo a retomada da ajuda militar e do compartilhamento de informações de inteligência pelos EUA.

Isso não significa que as armas da guerra se calarão imediatamente. Nenhum acordo de cessar-fogo entre as partes em conflito - Rússia e Ucrânia - foi assinado. Na verdade, não está claro nem mesmo a quantidade de detalhes contidos na proposta e o quanto dela já foi discutido com a Rússia durante conversas anteriores entre altos funcionários dos EUA e da Rússia.

No entanto, o acordo sinaliza um grande passo à frente.

Do ponto de vista ucraniano, ele tem várias vantagens. Em primeiro lugar, o grande racha entre Kiev e Washington foi, pelo menos, parcialmente remendado. O acordo sobre minerais - suspenso desde a briga de gritos na Casa Branca em 28 de fevereiro - está de volta. Trump fez um convite a Zelensky para que ele retorne a Washington e assine o acordo.

Igualmente importante para Kiev, a retomada do fornecimento de armas dos EUA para a Ucrânia e a suspensão da proibição do compartilhamento de inteligência fizeram parte do acordo, com efeito imediato. Isso restaura o apoio fundamental dos EUA no campo de batalha para a Ucrânia, incluindo a capacidade de Kiev de atingir alvos nas profundezas da Rússia.

Por outro lado, o presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, está agora em uma posição um pouco mais complicada. Ele precisa equilibrar seus objetivos de guerra na Ucrânia com o objetivo de reaproximação com os EUA, que pode ser estrategicamente mais importante.

As conversas entre altos funcionários dos EUA e da Rússia em 18 de fevereiro, na capital saudita, Riad, pareciam indicar que Moscou havia obtido concessões significativas de Washington - inclusive sobre a manutenção do território ocupado ilegalmente e a não adesão da Ucrânia à OTAN.

Essas concessões ainda podem estar sobre a mesa, juntamente com outras ofertas dos EUA para normalizar as relações e acabar com o isolamento da Rússia em relação ao Ocidente. Mas isso não significa que a Rússia terá uma pressa especial para pôr fim aos combates na Ucrânia. A economia do país tem resistido às sanções ocidentais de forma notável até o momento.

É provável que Putin também esteja interessado em capitalizar ainda mais o impulso que suas tropas ainda têm nas linhas de frente dentro da Ucrânia. E é improvável que ele queira se sentar para conversar sobre um cessar-fogo, muito menos sobre um acordo de paz, com Zelensky, enquanto a Ucrânia ainda detiver território na região de Kursk, dentro da Rússia. Embora as tropas ucranianas tenham sofrido pressão crescente recentemente e estejam em perigo de serem cercadas, é provável que a Rússia leve mais algum tempo para forçá-las a se retirar completamente ou a se render.

Institute for the Study of War

Portanto, é provável que Putin jogue por mais tempo em um esforço para aumentar sua vantagem no terreno e, ao mesmo tempo, evitar perturbar Trump. O vice-chefe da câmara alta do parlamento russo, o Conselho da Federação, e presidente de seu comitê de assuntos internacionais, Konstantin Kosachev, sinalizou isso após o anúncio do acordo entre os EUA e a Ucrânia. Ele insistiu que qualquer acordo teria que ser feito em termos russos, e não americanos, e muito menos ucranianos.

Isso indica uma disposição para conversar, mas também sinaliza que um acordo, mesmo em um cessar-fogo, ainda exigirá mais negociações.

Pontos de pressão

Jogar para ganhar tempo também permitirá que Putin evite rejeitar a proposta americana de imediato. Fazer isso seria uma grande aposta para o presidente russo. Trump já demonstrou sua disposição de exercer o máximo de pressão sobre a Ucrânia - e ele parece ter conseguido o que queria.

Antes da reunião entre os EUA e a Ucrânia em Jedá, ele também deixou claro que iria considerar mais sanções à Rússia para forçar Moscou a aceitar o fim dos combates na Ucrânia. Essas duas medidas - pressão sobre a Ucrânia e sobre a Rússia - fazem parte de um plano desenvolvido pelo enviado especial de Trump para a Ucrânia, Keith Kellogg, em maio de 2024.

Crucialmente, Kellogg também previu continuar “a armar a Ucrânia e fortalecer suas defesas para garantir que a Rússia não fará mais avanços e não atacará novamente após um cessar-fogo ou acordo de paz”.

Se Putin rejeitasse a proposta atual, ele não apenas arriscaria uma redefinição mais ampla das relações entre os EUA e a Rússia, mas também poderia perder sua vantagem atual no campo de batalha, bem como o território que Moscou controla atualmente. Isso porque um aumento nas capacidades militares ucranianas provavelmente mudaria o equilíbrio de poder, pelo menos em algumas partes da linha de frente.

O cenário mais provável para o futuro é uma abordagem russa em duas vertentes. É provável que o Kremlin se envolva com a Casa Branca na proposta americana de cessar-fogo que já foi aceita pela Ucrânia e, ao mesmo tempo, insista em obter mais ganhos territoriais antes da conclusão das negociações entre os EUA e a Rússia.

A configuração peculiar das negociações também joga a favor do Kremlin. Sem conversas diretas entre Kiev e Moscou, Washington tem que se movimentar entre eles, tentando fechar as lacunas entre suas posições com uma mistura de diplomacia e pressão. Até o momento, isso funcionou razoavelmente bem com a Ucrânia, mas é muito menos certo que essa abordagem dará frutos semelhantes com a Rússia.

O cessar-fogo temporário que está sendo discutido atualmente pode ser, ou não, um passo importante em direção a uma cessação permanente da violência e a um acordo de paz sustentável. O fato de ele se tornar um marco no caminho para a paz dependerá da disposição de Trump de pressionar a Rússia de forma semelhante à da Ucrânia.

É importante lembrar que a Ucrânia já pagou um preço enorme como resultado da agressão da Rússia. Qualquer atraso adicional no caminho para uma paz justa infligirá ainda mais dor à vítima, e não ao agressor.",theconversation

La chute des démocraties est-elle inéluctable ? Quelles leçons tirer de l’histoire des années 1930 pour éclairer notre présent ? Entretien avec Johann Chapoutot, spécialiste du nazisme, auteur de Les irresponsables. Qui a porté Hitler au pouvoir ? (Gallimard) et coauteur de Le monde nazi, 1919-1945, avec Christian Ingrao et Nicolas Patin (Tallandier).

Dans votre dernier ouvrage, Les Irresponsables, vous expliquez pourquoi il est pertinent et légitime de comparer notre époque et les années 1930. Quelle est votre démarche à ce sujet ?

Johann Chapoutot : La comparaison est permanente en histoire même si elle est tacite : c’est toujours depuis notre présent que l’on interroge le passé. Toute histoire est contemporaine dans la mesure où le questionnaire est le nôtre. Il faut simplement en être conscient.

Concernant la comparaison avec les années 1930, on entend souvent parler de « retour » des années 1930, avec une approche cyclique de l’histoire. Or le retour évoque un phénomène automatique ou quasi naturel – retour de la marée ou retour des saisons.

Plus intéressante est la proposition du philosophe Michaël Foessel qui parle de « récidive » des années 1930. C’est un concept juridique et judiciaire qui renvoie à des acteurs avec leur liberté, leur responsabilité, leurs choix. Aujourd’hui, on peut effectivement parler de récidive dans la mesure où des acteurs majeurs au pouvoir politique et économique se réfèrent explicitement à cette période.

On peut citer Musk et son salut nazi. Ou encore Donald Trump qui a soutenu les néonazis américains, défilant à Charlottesville en 2017, qui hurlaient « mort aux Juifs ». Trump a quand même déclaré qu’il s’agissait de « gens très bien ».

Au fond, pour les extrême droites mondiales soutenues par Musk, Trump, Milei ou Bolsonaro, le Troisième Reich allemand reste une référence indépassable : les nazis, c’est l’extrême droite qui a triomphé en conquérant un continent, en éliminant un peuple entier, en léguant à la postérité des images (défilés au cordeau, congrès spectaculaires, cinéma de propagande…) conçues pour être fascinantes.

Cette référence au nazisme est parfois honteuse en raison des crimes de masse, mais la honte s’efface, grâce à une légitimation assurée par des maîtres du monde. Ainsi les références au nazisme et au Troisième Reich se sont multipliées ces dernières années, engendrant une véritable épidémie mondiale de saluts nazis. L’historien est bien obligé de se saisir de la chose.

Votre livre Le Monde nazi nous permet de comprendre des similitudes entre notre époque et les années 1930 en matière de structures, de mécanismes économiques, sociaux, politiques… Quels sont-ils ?

J.C. : Si l’on compare les années 1930 et aujourd’hui, ce qui est saillant, c’est la disjonction entre démocratie et capitalisme. C’est ce que disent explicitement Peter Thiel ou Curtis Yarvin, les idéologues derrière Trump. On constate que le lien entre libéralisme économique et libéralisme politique, démocratie et croissance capitaliste n’était finalement que conjoncturel. Dès que les choses deviennent sérieuses, ceux qui font du profit abandonnent très vite le droit international, les droits humains, et finalement, la démocratie.

Rappelons que le 6 janvier 2021, le président Trump a présidé à un coup d’État. En 2025, comme l’explique Timothy Snyder, le coup d’État est désormais numérique : des hommes de Musk armés de clés USB siphonnent les données de l’administration américaine en toute tranquillité.

À la fin des années 1920, le monde arrive à l’épuisement d’un système libéral ultraspéculatif, aboutissant au krach de 1929, puis à une dépression économique massive. La décision a alors été prise, dans une grande partie de l’Europe, d’abandonner les rêves de démocratie issus de la Première Guerre mondiale et d’instaurer un pouvoir fort pour le rétablissement de taux de profit maximaux.

C’est clairement la promesse d’Hitler, le 27 janvier 1932. Il fait un discours devant plus d’un millier patrons au Club de l’industrie de Düsseldorf et leur annonce trois choses. D’abord, la revanche sur la République de Weimar : les patrons avaient, en 1918, beaucoup lâché – sur la journée de 8 heures, l’augmentation des salaires, ou la représentativité syndicale – en raison de la pression de mouvements révolutionnaires. Hitler leur promet que le patron redeviendra à nouveau le « maître dans sa maison » et qu’une loi fera des patrons des « Führer d’entreprise ».

La deuxième promesse, c’est de rétablir le principe de la hiérarchie le Führerprinzip, selon lequel la démocratie, ça ne vaut rien, ni dans l’armée, ni dans l’entreprise, ni pour l’État. Et troisièmement, il promet le rétablissement de taux de profit maximum par la conquête militaire. Son projet est d’arracher militairement les zones d’extraction d’énergie et de matières premières à d’autres États. C’est la logique coloniale prédatrice qui a prévalu au XIXe siècle.

Or Trump ne dit pas autre chose. Il veut prendre le Groenland simplement parce qu’il en a besoin. Zelensky doit donner 500 milliards de dollars de terres rares dans un « deal » d’extorsion mafieuse. Dans un contexte de croissance baissière pour les pays anciennement industrialisés, il n’y a plus de moyens de satisfaire les exigences des rendements financiers délirants, alors on revient aux bonnes vieilles méthodes de prédation : on va donc, à l’extérieur, saisir des territoires et, à l’intérieur, détruire l’État social et l’État de droit afin de revenir à une domination sans partage du patronat.

De ce point de vue là, les choses sont très comparables. Les années 1930 sont très éclairantes pour comprendre ce que nous vivons aujourd’hui.

Quelles différences peuvent être soulignées entre notre époque et les années 1930 ?

J.C. : La différence majeure, c’est le soubassement anthropologique lié à la Grande Guerre avec ses 80 millions d’hommes sous l’uniforme et une vingtaine de millions de morts. Il s’agit d’une promotion de la violence physique à un niveau jusqu’alors inégalé dans l’histoire. Les sociétés européennes ont été marquées par ce que l’historien Georges Mossé appelle une brutalisation, c’est-à-dire une rémanence de la violence et du culte de la violence dans les sociétés civiles. Mais si on lisse ce paramètre-là, qui se traduisait notamment à l’extrême droite par une grande violence, des combats de rue et des assassinats, on se rend compte que les analogies structurelles avec notre temps sont bien là.

Les fascistes d’aujourd’hui ne vont pas défiler en uniforme sur les Champs-Élysées, faire des ratonnades ou des pogroms. On assiste parfois à des descentes, mais ce n’est plus un phénomène de masse. La violence s’exprime surtout avec des menaces et des insultes sur les réseaux sociaux, beaucoup moins dans la rue.

Dans Le Monde nazi, vous montrez que le nazisme n’est pas une exception de l’histoire. Pourquoi est-ce important de le comprendre aujourd’hui ?

J.C. : Je ne blâme pas ceux qui, après 1945, ont dit que nous n’avions rien à voir avec les nazis. C’était peut être thérapeutiquement nécessaire après 1945, après l’horreur et la dévastation. De la même manière, je comprends le général de Gaulle qui dit que les Français ont tous été résistants. C’est faux, mais opportun pour reconstruire un pays. Par contre, je suis conscient que ce n’est pas de l’histoire, c’est de la mythologie politique. Quand je fais de l’histoire, je suis bien obligé de constater que le nazisme n’est pas un aérolithe qui a frappé la terre et qui s’est dissout. Ce n’est pas une génération spontanée qui s’est rabougrie. C’est un phénomène qui est issu d’une très longue temporalité culturelle, pas seulement allemande.

De nombreux travaux – dont les miens – montrent que les éléments constitutifs du nazisme n’ont rien d’originellement allemand : le racisme n’est pas inventé par les Allemands, pas plus que l’antisémitisme, le nationalisme, l’eugénisme ou le darwinisme social.

Tout ce qui structure l’univers mental nazi est généralement une denrée d’importation. Colonialisme, darwinisme social, racisme sont d’abord l’affaire des Britanniques et des Français qui créent les deux premiers empires coloniaux, puis des Américains qui ont un empire colonial à domicile avec l’importation massive d’esclaves pendant des siècles. Le nazisme est un phénomène qui est issu du cœur de l’Europe du XXe siècle.

Par ailleurs, on l’a vu, il y a des échos du nazisme aujourd’hui, car les composantes constitutives du nazisme ne se sont pas dissoutes après 1945. Le nazisme, le racisme ont continué à prospérer dans des empires coloniaux. Dans les manuels de géographie français, du début des années 1960, on parlait encore de « races humaines ». L’antisémitisme se porte bien, il me semble. Le darwinisme social triomphe partout, y compris dans la bouche d’Emmanuel Macron qui distingue ceux qui ont réussi et ceux qui « ne sont rien ». Le colonialisme, l’impérialisme, le capitalisme, toutes ces idées se portent également très bien.

Dans Les irresponsables, vous décrivez la proximité entre le centre et l’extrême droite dans l’Allemagne des années 1930. Vous montrez que si Hitler est arrivé au pouvoir, ce n’est pas grâce aux électeurs, mais par un calcul politicien des conservateurs allemands. Quelles analogies proposez-vous avec notre époque, notamment en France ?

J.C. : Au moment où le centre et les conservateurs se rapprochent de l’extrême droite dans de nombreux pays d’Europe, dont la France, je rappelle que l’arrivée d’Hitler au pouvoir est liée, non à un vote populaire mais à une décision politique cynique des libéraux autoritaires – Franz von Papen en l’occurrence. Ce dernier a pensé que la meilleure manière de se maintenir au pouvoir, c’était de s’allier avec les nazis. Or cette décision a été prise dans un contexte d’effondrement du parti nazi qui aurait pu conduire à sa disparition.

Cette histoire montre que l’arrivée des nazis au pouvoir n’était pas inéluctable, pas plus que le « retour » de l’extrême droite aujourd’hui n’est inéluctable. Il n’y a pas de phénomènes géologiques ou tectoniques ou hydrographiques à l’œuvre, il y a des acteurs politiques avec leurs intérêts, leurs décisions, leurs responsabilités.

En 1932, c’est une mécanique de décisions désastreuses prises au nom d’intérêts sordides (les intérêts patrimoniaux, fiscaux et financiers de familles dirigeantes) qui conduit à la catastrophe. L’histoire n’est pas de la science naturelle : l’histoire, c’est l’indéfinition totale, avec un vaste champ des possibles toujours ouvert, une liberté des acteurs, et donc une responsabilité des acteurs.

Dans un moment où nos démocraties semblent en position de grande faiblesse, l’historien spécialiste du nazisme que vous êtes donne plutôt un message d’espoir ?

J.C. : Absolument. Le pire, au fond, c’est la résignation générale : « Les extrêmes droites montent partout, ça va bientôt être notre tour. » Il n’y a aucune nécessité à une quelconque marée qui n’existe pas. En France, 27 instituts de sondage nous disaient que le RN allait obtenir la majorité absolue en juin 2024. Or, c’est la gauche qui gagne aux élections législatives.

Nous avons un avantage vis-à-vis de nos aînés des années 1930 : nous savons à quoi nous en tenir vis-à-vis de l’extrême droite, nous savons ce qu’elle signifie. On entend parfois : « On n’a jamais essayé. » Mais si, précisément, on a essayé : ça s’appelle l’État français du maréchal Pétain, le fascisme en Italie, le nazisme en Allemagne. On sait à quoi ça mène. Cela éclaire et cela a suscité une réaction civique et politique majeure en juin 2024 face au risque d’un dirigeant RN à Matignon. D’où l’irresponsabilité folle du président Macron lorsqu’il décide de ne pas tenir compte du résultat des élections. Le message qui est envoyé, c’est que vous pouvez voter, mais peu importe. Est-ce qu’une mobilisation pour éviter la victoire du RN aura lieu lors de la prochaine élection ? C’est le danger.

Pourtant, la société civile française tient, les institutions tiennent aussi, parce qu’elles ont été pensées à la lumière de ce qui s’est passé dans l’entre-deux-guerres. Ce qui donne espoir, et Vincent Tiberj l’a très bien montré, c’est que les valeurs de la population générale, ce n’est pas écraser la gueule du voisin, faire des tags à croix gammée, des pogroms ou des ratonnades et gagner des tonnes d’argent au mépris de l’environnement.

Non, les valeurs, communément partagées, ce sont la solidarité, l’accueil, la tolérance. C’est un miroir inversé de ce que l’on voit dans les médias de Vincent Bolloré qui sont au service d’intérêts privés bien connus. Il est frappant de constater les similarités du système médiatique actuel et celui du magnat des médias Alfred Hugenberg dans l'Allemagne des années 1930. Je pense notamment à l’utilisation de « paniques morales » destinées à cliver la société : à l’époque, c’était le « bolchévisme culturel », désormais c’est le « wokisme ».

Autre motif d’espoir : les gens qui tiennent les institutions ont changé, notamment la justice. La magistrature allemande de l’entre-deux-guerres est marquée à l’extrême droite. Il s’agit de magistrats d’ancien régime. Pour eux, la Constitution de Weimar était scandaleuse, il s’agissait d’une « invention des juifs », d’une « importation française », d’un « crime contre la race », etc. Par ailleurs, la magistrature de l’époque était issue du 1 % de la population qui avait fait des études supérieures. Aujourd’hui, la massification de l’enseignement a fait son œuvre et les gens qui sont garants des institutions n’ont plus rien à voir avec leurs aînés.

Désormais, en France, l’une des lignes qui tient – de l’autoroute 69 à Sainte-Soline, en passant par les droits des migrants, les droits des femmes, les droits des enfants –, c’est la justice. Aux États-Unis, Trump, comme lors du premier mandat, se heurte à la justice.

Au plan international, les extrêmes droites gagnent du terrain partout, Trump sidère la planète par ses décisions quotidiennes. Doit-on s’attendre au pire ?

J.C. : Nous vivons la fin d’une ère, celle de la contre-révolution conservatrice ouverte dans les années 1970 et théorisée par des néolibéraux américains comme l’a bien montré Grégoire Chamayou. Cela s’est traduit par l’élection de Reagan et sa politique de dérégulation, de financiarisation, de destruction de l’État social, d’agitation ultranationaliste, etc. La fin de cette histoire est très violente, dans un contexte d’absence de croissance et de pression effrénée de la part des investisseurs financiers. Désormais, certains acteurs – notamment le gouvernement et les grandes entreprises américaines – ont décidé de ne plus faire semblant : ils cognent, brutalement, dans les mots, dans les images, et dans les actes.

Pourtant, là encore, on peut parier sur l’incompétence de Trump et consorts. Après deux mois de présidence, Trump chute déjà dans les sondages il est rappelé à l’ordre par les marchés et par les industriels à propos des droits de douane.

Cela veut dire qu’il faut garder son sang-froid et ne pas tomber dans le premier piège que tend l’extrême droite : faire peur, sidérer. Steve Bannon a appelé à une stratégie de « flood the zone » : inonder la zone de mensonges, d’insultes, de n’importe quoi… C’est aussi ce qu’ont fait les nazis : ils ont frappé tellement fort que personne n’a d’abord su comment répondre.

Ces gens sont conjoncturellement en mesure de faire des dégâts, mais pas structurellement. Rappelons que Trump a été élu avec presque le même nombre d’électeurs que lorsqu’il a perdu en 2020. Les électeurs démocrates ne se sont pas déplacés : il a gagné, mais il pouvait aussi bien perdre. Dans un an et demi avec les midterms, vu la pente dans l’électorat américain, il pourrait perdre sa majorité au congrès. C’est un motif d’espoir.

Fait surprenant : une skieuse « loisir » court un risque trois fois plus élevé de se blesser que ses homologues masculins. Ratio qu’on ne retrouve pas chez les professionnels. Comment l’expliquer et surtout, comment prévenir ces blessures ?

La neige, le soleil, les éclats de rire, la glisse… toutes ces belles images associées aux vacances d’hiver… et soudain la chute, le genou qui se tord entraînant une lésion du ligament croisé antérieur (LCA), la douleur… et les suites : opérations, séances de kiné, arrêt de travail… Les ruptures de ce ligament comptent à elles seules pour 20 % des blessures en ski. Tous les niveaux de pratique sont touchés, du débutant au compétiteur. Mais il faut souligner qu’une skieuse « loisir » a un taux de lésion du LCA trois fois plus élevé que celui de ses homologues masculins.

Le ligament croisé antérieur (LCA) est situé au centre de l’articulation du genou et en assure sa stabilité, aidé par des contractions musculaires. Anatomiquement, le mécanisme qui conduit à sa lésion correspond à un mouvement de « torsion » excessif du tibia sous le fémur, le genou rentrant vers l’intérieur.

Les mécanismes lésionnels et les solutions de prévention diffèrent entre la pratique compétitrice et récréative, concentrons-nous sur la pratique de loisirs, constituant la plus grande partie des vacanciers dans les stations de ski.

Le ski : un cocktail explosif pour nos genoux

Tout d’abord, pourquoi le LCA est-il si souvent touché en ski alpin ? Plusieurs explications viennent malheureusement s’additionner, faisant de ce sport un cocktail explosif pour nos genoux !

Premièrement, le mouvement traumatique du LCA peut se produire dans de nombreuses situations de ski, à vitesse faible comme élevée, lors de chutes ou non. Il peut s’agir d’une contrainte mécanique avec une surcharge du genou lors d’une réception de saut ou sur un appui puissant. Une mise en tension musculaire peut aussi expliquer cette lésion, car trop forte, trop rapide et/ou non optimale.

Une autre particularité de la pratique du ski est la position fléchie du genou entre 30° et 90° lors du virage, or c’est justement l’amplitude articulaire dans laquelle le genou est le moins stable compte tenu d’un système ligamentaire détendu. Le genou peut aussi subir une flexion excessive suite à un déplacement du centre de gravité vers l’arrière et le côté, appelé mécanisme du « pied fantôme ». Des accélérations du tibia différentes de celles du fémur peuvent se produire, entraînant un cisaillement antérieur du tibia, une hyperextension brutale.

Une autre explication vient de l’environnement de pratique, comme la présence d’obstacles fixes (arbres, pylônes) et mobiles (les autres skieurs), des conditions météorologiques particulières (températures basses, visibilité dégradée) et changeantes (variations des qualités de la neige).

Enfin, deux autres explications concernent le matériel. Les chaussures rigides maintenant fermement le pied et la cheville, c’est bien le genou, la première articulation à être sollicitée et à subir les contraintes. Quant aux skis, ils sont aussi les ennemis de nos genoux. La carre d’un ski peut mordre la neige et ainsi partir dans une direction alors que celle de l’autre ski préférerait rester dans une autre direction. Compte tenu de leurs dimensions importantes (longueur, largeur et masses), les skis peuvent aussi agir comme un levier entraînant la jambe en rotation avec un moment de force alors important.

Des stratégies de prévention efficaces pour les femmes

La diversité des mécanismes lésionnels induit une diversité de « stratégies de prévention ». Les recherches en épidémiologie parlent de facteurs prédisposant à la pathologie et les classent en deux catégories.

Malheureusement, la première catégorie est non modifiable car propre au skieur. On y retrouve des facteurs comme le sexe, les antécédents de blessures, l’âge ou certaines particularités anatomiques. Par exemple, l’hyperlaxité (élasticité excessive de certains tissus) ou la forme particulière du tibia ou du fémur jouent un rôle dans la stabilité et les contraintes ligamentaires du genou.

C’est d’ailleurs ce qui explique en partie que les femmes soient plus à risque de rupture du LCA, avec une déviation des genoux vers l’intérieur comme des jambes en X (valgus) plus marquée et une structure ligamentaire moins tolérante aux contraintes que les hommes. S’y ajoute l’influence hormonale, avec un risque qui semble évoluer en fonction des différentes phases du cycle menstruel.

Par contre, connaître cette fragilité permet d’adapter sa pratique ou son entraînement. De nouveau, l’exemple des femmes est intéressant car les skieuses de haut niveau ne présentent plus un risque accru de rupture du LCA par rapport à leurs homologues masculins. L’explication est à chercher dans la catégorie de facteurs modifiables prédisposant à la pathologie. Ils peuvent concerner le skieur lui-même, par exemple les capacités du système neuromusculaire, que ce soit la production de puissance, de résistance à la fatigue ou encore les qualités proprioceptives (la proprioception désigne la perception, par le cerveau, de la position des différentes parties du corps dans l’espace, ndlr).

Il a été montré que les qualités de production de force jouent un rôle important dans la prévention des ruptures du LCA, notamment en cas d’asymétrie importante entre les deux jambes ou de déséquilibre entre les muscles agonistes et antagonistes du genou avec une force du quadriceps supérieure aux ischio-jambiers (ratio I/Q).

D’ailleurs, les skieuses « loisirs » présentent un risque deux fois plus élevé de rupture du LCA sur leur jambe non dominante considérée comme moins forte ainsi qu’un ratio I/Q important. Des programmes de renforcement, de coordination et d’équilibre vont permettre de les améliorer, avec un focus sur le contrôle de la stabilité du genou. Cette solution est largement utilisée par les skieurs compétiteurs dans le cadre de leur entraînement. Et c’est ce qui explique en partie l’égalité de skieuses et des skieurs compétiteurs face aux lésions du LCA, les skieuses ayant corrigé les déséquilibres d’activité musculaire ratio I/Q de chaque cuisse ou entre les deux membres.

Le laboratoire LIBM que je dirige (Université Savoie Mont-Blanc) travaille activement sur la mise en place de tests originaux pour évaluer les qualités des skieurs élites.

Bien se préparer avant de skier est indispensable

Le skieur « loisir », et surtout la skieuse, devrait donc aussi préparer sa semaine de vacances à la neige avec un programme physique adapté les semaines précédentes ou mieux, une pratique sportive régulière mixant du cardio, du renforcement musculaire et de la proprioception.

Et si cela n’est pas fait alors que les vacances commencent, il est temps au moins de s’échauffer avant de s’élancer sur la piste : des mouvements de mobilité de toutes les articulations, des flexions de genoux lentes puis dynamiques, des fentes avant et c’est parti !

Il est également important de prendre en compte les signes de fatigue arrivant au cours de la journée de ski ou de la semaine, pour s’arrêter avant la blessure. Des muscles douloureux, raides et répondant moins bien, une diminution de l’attention, des mouvements moins fluides et des déséquilibres, voilà des signes à prendre en compte.

Un autre facteur modifiable par le skieur est son propre comportement, en choisissant une piste adaptée à son niveau et en réduisant sa vitesse pour rester maître de ses trajectoires.

Ces facteurs intrinsèques nécessitent que le skieur prenne conscience de ses capacités, de l’environnement montagnard et du matériel pour adapter son comportement : enfin un facteur qui place les skieuses en bonne position, car elles présentent significativement des comportements moins à risques que les skieurs !

Quant au matériel, il est aussi au cœur du dispositif des solutions de prévention des lésions du LCA. Il a été montré que les dimensions du ski influencent significativement les blessures, de par le levier important qu’ils induisent. Ainsi, des skis plus courts et moins larges sont moins dangereux pour les genoux.

Des réglages des fixations à adapter

La dernière solution, et non la moindre, concerne la fixation de ski. Sa fonction première est de maintenir le ski à la chaussure pour créer une interface ski-skieur et ainsi permettre la pratique de cette activité sportive. Mais cette fixation doit aussi être capable de se décrocher pour libérer le pied du skieur de son ski lorsque le genou est en danger. Le ski libéré ne constitue ainsi plus un levier important entraînant la jambe puis le genou en rotation ou en translation.

Pour répondre à ces fonctions opposées, les fixations abritent des ressorts mis en compression sous l’action du chaussage. En ce qui concerne le déchaussage, il sera obtenu par un mouvement de la fixation sous l’action d’un moment de force jusqu’à une position donnée.

Ainsi, régler la libération d’une fixation consiste à ajuster la compression du ressort au moment de force souhaité pour le déchaussage. Ce réglage est indiqué par une norme. La sélection d’un réglage se fait en fonction du poids du skieur et de la longueur de sa coque de chaussure de ski. Cette valeur sera ensuite adaptée de façon empirique au niveau, à l’environnement de pratique (type de neige), à la perception du skieur (engagement, peur) et, plus récemment, au sexe, en augmentant ou diminuant ce réglage. En conséquence, la détermination des forces rencontrée dans l’activité – et du réglage associé – est primordiale, tout comme le processus de déclenchement.

Or, les études épidémiologiques montrent que ce point pourrait être largement amélioré. Parmi une cohorte de 498 skieurs « loisirs » blessés au LCA, l’absence de déchaussage correspondait à 78 % des cas, et était significativement plus élevée chez les femmes que chez les hommes (83 % contre 66 %). La fréquence nettement plus faible de déchaussage des fixations chez les skieuses blessées au LCA est bien connue dans la littérature.

La piste du déchaussage semble donc être un bon moyen de prévenir les lésions du LCA chez le skieur loisir, et encore plus chez la skieuse. C’est de nouveau un des points d’attention de mon laboratoire qui travaille sur la compréhension des moments de forces lors de la pratique du ski alpin, avec un focus sur la skieuse. J’ai d’ailleurs montré que les skieuses présentaient des forces appliquées sur la fixation bien moindres que ceux des hommes, ce qui explique le non-déchaussage de leur fixation… et donc, en partie, le risque accru de lésion du LCA.

Il est par conséquent important de sensibiliser les skieurs et les skieuses au réglage adapté et sécurisant de leurs fixations, avec l’aide d’un professionnel. Ainsi, pour une skieuse, il est maintenant proposé de diminuer de 15 % la valeur des réglages par rapport à la norme ISO et de 30 %, si c’est une débutante.

En conclusion, la prévention passe par la correction des facteurs modifiables mis en cause dans les ruptures du LCA. Des solutions sont proposées, mais pas suffisamment, à en croire les données épidémiologiques qui restent élevées. Il reste encore donc du travail aux chercheurs, aux industriels, aux exploitants et aux aménageurs des stations de ski pour limiter ce risque.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,"L’instruction à domicile, réponse à la phobie scolaire ?",https://theconversation.com/linstruction-a-domicile-reponse-a-la-phobie-scolaire-251181,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 16:35:18 GMT","Face aux phénomènes de phobie scolaire, qui mêlent symptômes psychologiques et difficultés sociales, certains parents font le choix de l’instruction à domicile. Remise en perspective de ce cheminement à partir d’une enquête par entretiens.

L’école a toujours cherché à encadrer les élèves et leurs professeurs, avec un mode d’enseignement longtemps basé sur l’autorité et la discipline. Cependant, les savoirs pédagogiques, les connaissances psychologiques, les politiques publiques ainsi que des transformations sociales (massification scolaire, montée des droits individuels, nouvelles attentes éducatives) ont largement contribué à transformer les normes éducatives et la manière dont on interprète entre autres les manquements à l’assiduité.

Dans un contexte de compétition, où la responsabilité individuelle est de plus en plus mise en avant, les attentes de l’école peuvent engendrer stress, fatigue et épuisement, conduisant enfants et adolescents au retrait de la scène scolaire. Ce phénomène, qui mêle des symptômes psychologiques à des difficultés sociales, reflète les transformations contemporaines de l’école.

Bien que de nombreuses recherches existent sur les modes de production et les vécus des problèmes scolaires, peu d’études portent précisément sur le refus d’école. Il s’agissait ici de s’intéresser aux expériences de parents face à ce trouble aux multiples appellations : phobie scolaire, retrait scolaire, refus scolaire anxieux, syndrome d’inadaptation scolaire, anorexie scolaire, student apathy…

Ce sujet soulève ainsi plusieurs questions : comment ce trouble est-il perçu, relaté et pris en charge par les familles ? Quelles sont les remédiations envisagées face aux souffrances des élèves concernés ? Notre étude repose sur une approche qualitative, fondée sur 23 entretiens approfondis avec des parents, principalement des mères issues des classes moyennes et supérieures.

Une difficulté à entrer dans le cadre scolaire

Les troubles phobiques constituent un motif de souffrance pour les parents qui se sentent à la fois poussés à se justifier et démunis pour inscrire leurs enfants dans des cadres qui ne soient pas trop dévalorisants. La phobie est généralement décrite comme une souffrance psychique et une inadéquation/inadaptation des affects et des conduites aux attendus sociaux et scolaires. Elle est définie par les mères rencontrées comme une « incapacité » et une « insuffisance » à exercer pleinement le métier d’élève.

C’est l’empêchement même de l’action et de l’engagement dans l’activité scolaire qui est évoquée. La phobie est envisagée comme une combinaison de pensées, d’émotions, de comportements et de rapports avec autrui perçus comme « déséquilibrés » et « douloureux ». Les mères évoquent un « malaise », de la « peur », de l’« anxiété », une « panne », du « désengagement » et du « ralentissement »…

Tous les discours partagent un dénominateur commun : la variété des troubles, tant physiques qu’émotionnels, comme l’instabilité, l’inhibition, l’isolement, le manque de sociabilité, la colère, les maux de tête, les nausées… L’incapacité à nouer et à entretenir des relations positives avec ses camarades, sa famille ou les professeurs est une autre caractéristique majeure. Les craintes associées à des épreuves scolaires, les difficultés à accepter la réalité de la responsabilité et de l’autonomie personnelle, les peurs à réagir négativement aux nouvelles expériences, le manque de confiance en soi, les postures critiques et exigeantes, l’incapacité d’exprimer ses besoins et d’expliciter ses attentes… sont autant de défaillances individuelles pointées par les parents.

La mauvaise gestion du stress, les craintes devant les réactions des camarades et la peur d’échouer sont aussi des attitudes qui interpellent. Les épreuves subjectives de certaines expériences scolaires comme les moqueries des camarades, ou l’incompréhension des enseignants peuvent conduire à des retraits et à des révisions à la baisse des ambitions scolaires. De stigmatisations immédiates et durables à de petites défaillances capacitaires, les mères donnent à entendre toute la gamme des attitudes et des comportements perçus aujourd’hui négativement.

Doutes et manque de confiance de l'enfant

On peut pointer, aux dires des enquêtées, trois catégories essentielles de défaillances ou de reproches adressés par l’institution aux jeunes.

Tout d’abord, des mises en cause de soi qui renvoient au manque de travail scolaire et d’engagement sérieux dans les tâches pédagogiques (« paresse », « travail bâclé »…) ;

ensuite, celles qui traduisent un manque d’attachement aux règles scolaires de vie commune (« arriver en retard », « n’en faire qu’à sa tête », « dissipée ») ;

pour finir, celles qui traduisent des lacunes quant aux compétences sociales et cognitives attendues (« lenteur », « rêveur », « immaturité », « introverti », « manque d’autonomie »…).

Les évocations donnent à entendre une difficulté à être soi et à satisfaire un certain idéal scolaire. Manque de confiance, doute de soi, difficulté à décider ou à coopérer, isolement, routines protectrices, quête de confirmation de soi, tension sur la bonne proximité ou distance aux autres sont autant de signes traduisant une peur de l’insuffisance.

Réponse parentale et « choix » d’instruction en famille

Abasourdies par la survenue de ces difficultés et désireuses de répondre au mieux à la situation et de maintenir leurs enfants à flot, les personnes interrogées vont tenter d’instaurer différentes modalités de présence scolaire dans l’univers du jeune. L’émergence de la phobie va entraîner, chez toutes les familles enquêtées, un temps plus ou moins long d’éloignement de l’école et d’entrée dans l’instruction en famille. La question qui va rapidement se poser, c’est celle de la compatibilité ou non entre situation psychologique du jeune et poursuite, dans un cadre alternatif, des études.

La poursuite de la scolarité dans la famille prendra des formes variées qui dépendent largement, d’une part, de l’état de santé de l’enfant ou de l’adolescent et, d’autre part, des rapports entretenus avec l’institution au moment de l’émergence des difficultés (coopération, échange, collaboration, confiance, communication/conflit, opposition, résistances, etc.).

L’instruction à domicile de ces jeunes peut prendre différentes formes, plus ou moins institutionnalisées : enseignement à distance via le Centre national d’enseignement à distance (Cned) ; aménagement scolaire ; mixte Cned/instruction en famille/école ; instruction en famille assurée par la seule famille, avec un cadrage assez scolaire respectant les programmes et exigences ; mode informel d’instruction en famille fondé sur une « pédagogie » libre de découverte et d’initiative personnelle…

Le choix de l’instruction à domicile dépend également du niveau d’adhésion des parents à une réintégration scolaire rapide.

Nous remarquons que les familles qui souhaitent le maintien d’un cadre scolaire dans ce temps de repos afin de viser une rescolarisation rapide ont connu des rapports relativement apaisés avec l’école et vont privilégier des modalités formelles d’instruction. À l’inverse, celles qui ont connu des tensions récurrentes avec l’école vont faire du retour en classe une priorité moins essentielle et vont privilégier une instruction en famille moins formalisée (pédagogie du projet en autonomie, découverte individuelle en fonction des besoins et intérêts de l’enfant…).

L’analyse du refus scolaire à travers l’expérience des parents met en lumière les multiples facettes de cette réalité, qui va bien au-delà d’un simple rejet psychologique de l’école.

Ce trouble est le reflet de souffrances psychologiques et sociales profondes, liées à une incapacité de l’élève à s’adapter aux attentes et aux normes scolaires contemporaines. Les réponses parentales sont plurielles. Elles témoignent toutes d’un désir de protéger le jeune tout en recherchant une forme d’équilibre entre son bien-être et ses besoins éducatifs. Équilibre qui dépend fortement des rapports antérieurs des parents à l’institution scolaire.

Cette analyse s’inscrit dans le projet « Une sociographie inédite de l’instruction en famille – SociogrIEF » ayant bénéficié du soutien de l’Agence nationale de la recherche (ANR), qui finance en France la recherche sur projet. L’ANR a pour mission de soutenir et de promouvoir le développement de recherches fondamentales et finalisées dans toutes les disciplines, et de renforcer le dialogue entre science et société.

Au vu du rôle des accords de Munich dans la marche à la Seconde Guerre mondiale, la question mérite d’être approfondie.

Des similitudes géo-historiques

Les Allemands des Sudètes, comme les Russes d’Ukraine, sont des minorités intégrées dans de nouveaux États créés lors de l’éclatement, respectivement, de l’Empire austro-hongrois et de l’URSS.

À l’automne 1918, les Allemands des Sudètes réclament, sans succès, leur rattachement à l’Autriche. En 1991, l’indépendance de l’Ukraine vis-à-vis de l’URSS finissante est approuvée par référendum, tous les oblasts (régions) du pays votant en faveur du « oui ». Toutefois, dans les oblasts où la population d’origine russe est numériquement importante, certaines voix revendiquent une forme d’autonomie.

En 1921, les Allemands des Sudètes représentent 23 % de la population tchécoslovaque, et sont regroupés près des frontières de la Bohème avec l’Allemagne et l’Autriche. Le sentiment irrédentiste se développe dans les années 1920 et surtout 1930, en particulier après la prise de pouvoir de Hitler. L’interdiction en Tchécoslovaquie des partis allemands traditionnels en 1935 n’arrange rien car elle ouvre la voie à la domination du « Parti allemand des Sudètes », fondé en 1933 par Konrad Henlein et directement inféodé au Parti national-socialiste allemand : il joindra d’ailleurs son action à celle du Reich pour précipiter la crise de 1938.

En Ukraine, la minorité identifiée comme russe représente en 2001 17,1 % de la population totale, mais plus d’un tiers dans le Donbass. Bien que le critère linguistique puisse être discuté, il reste le meilleur indicateur disponible de l’importance et de la localisation de cette population de « Russes ukrainiens ».

Comme on le voit, la population russophone n’est majoritaire qu’en Crimée, et dépasse 30 % dans les oblasts de Donetsk et de Lougansk.

Le développement d’un irrédentisme russe est rythmé par les épisodes de la politique intérieure qui opposent régulièrement pro-russes et pro-européens, dans des affrontements électoraux aux résultats souvent contestés.

Premier président de l’Ukraine indépendante, Léonid Kravtchouk se tourne vers l’Europe et signe en 1994 un accord de partenariat avec l’UE. Cette même année, il est battu à la présidentielle par Léonid Koutchma, favorable à la Russie, mais qui se rapproche au cours des années suivantes de l’UE et de l’OTAN.

Koutchma est réélu en 1999. La présidentielle de 2004 est très polarisée sur le thème du positionnement international. Après une tentative d’assassinat contre son concurrent, le candidat pro-européen Viktor Iouchtchenko, le pro-russe Viktor Ianoukovitch est déclaré vainqueur avec une marge de 3 %. Ce résultat, contesté par l’opposition comme par les observateurs internationaux, déclenche la révolution orange. Un nouveau scrutin organisé en décembre voit le résultat inversé et Viktor Iouchtchenko élu, Moscou contestant ce retournement qui constitue à ses yeux un coup d’État soutenu par les Occidentaux.

L’impopularité de Iouchtchenko, nourrie par son incapacité à gérer la tension entre communautés et à lutter contre la corruption, aboutit en 2010 à l’élection de Ianoukovitch, qui recourt à des méthodes autoritaires contre l’opposition mais obtient de Moscou des conditions économiques favorables. Fin 2013, son refus de signer un accord d’association avec l’UE provoque les manifestations dites d’Euromaidan, comparables à celles de la Révolution orange et amenant au même résultat : le départ de ce président pro-russe et l’élection le 23 mai 2014 d’un nouveau président, le quasi-milliardaire Petro Porochenko.

Entretemps, Vladimir Poutine avait occupé puis annexé la Crimée et encouragé la révolte armée des Russes du Donbass, aboutissement du processus de radicalisation de l’opposition entre communautés largement nourri par la Russie.

Les combats du Donbass se poursuivent avec plus ou moins d’intensité jusqu’au déclenchement de l’« opération spéciale » russe le 24 février 2022 qui vise à envahir la totalité de l’Ukraine. La résistance inattendue des troupes ukrainiennes, soutenues par les Occidentaux, privant Poutine d’une victoire rapide, le conflit tourne à une guerre d’attrition qu’il devient difficile à l’Ukraine de soutenir une quatrième année, d’où l’importance des négociations engagées au début de 2025, à l’initiative du président Trump.

Munich, septembre 1938 : un lâchage vu comme une garantie de paix

Après l’Anschluss en 1938, la région des Sudètes représente la cible suivante pour la réunion au sein du Reich des territoires peuplés d’Allemands. En 1938, Hitler fait monter la pression, à la fois interne par le mouvement de Heinlen et externe par des menaces sur le gouvernement tchèque de Bénès, auquel il adresse finalement un ultimatum qui fait peser une menace de guerre.

Malgré d’importantes concessions acceptées par Bénès, la menace hitlérienne se confirme en septembre. D’importantes forces sont massées aux frontières. Mussolini prend alors l’initiative d’une conférence réunissant à Munich les 29 au 30 septembre Hitler, Mussolini, le premier ministre britannique Neville Chamberlain et le président du conseil français Édouard Daladier, ainsi que leurs ministres des Affaires étrangères, mais sans représentant tchèque.

Désireux d’éviter une guerre pour laquelle ils ne s’estiment pas prêts, les Franco-Britanniques « lâchent » la Tchécoslovaquie et entérinent les exigences hitlériennes : la région des Sudètes doit être évacuée par l’armée tchécoslovaque avant le 15 octobre et ces territoires rattachés à l’Allemagne.

Claude Zygiel, Historický ústav AV ČR eds, Prague, 2019

Les réactions en France et au Royaume-Uni sont en général favorables, et les accords facilement ratifiés. Contrairement à Chamberlain, Daladier n’est pas dupe : on lui prête ces mots à l’égard de la foule qui l’applaudit à son retour à Paris : « Ah, les cons. S’ils savaient. »

Les opposants déclarés aux accords de Munich sont rares. En France, à part le Parti communiste qui condamne l’absence de l’URSS plutôt que la teneur des accords, Henri de Kerillis, député du groupe des indépendants républicains présidé par Georges Mandel, est le seul, avec un député socialiste moins en vue, à voter contre, en s’expliquant vigoureusement dans les colonnes du quotidien L’Époque :

« Après la honteuse capitulation qui avait fait la joie des “pacifistes” et le désespoir des hommes sensés et informés, on s’aperçoit que nous sommes plus près de la guerre que nous ne l’étions auparavant… Tant pis si l’on vient me dire que je veux la guerre quand j’écris que le meilleur moyen de l’éviter, c’est de ne pas proclamer devant “l’assassin” que nous sommes faibles et que nous avons peur. »

À Londres, Winston Churchill est l’opposant le plus notoire, avec son ami Anthony Eden. Avec son éloquence habituelle, il s’exclame aux Communes le 5 octobre :

« Nos braves et loyaux compatriotes […] doivent savoir que nous avons essuyé une défaite sans avoir fait la guerre, dont les conséquences vont nous accompagner longtemps sur notre route. »

L’Ukraine à la merci du « grand deal » de Donald Trump

Les circonstances sont certes différentes, entre des concessions pour éviter un conflit et le soutien apporté à une paix déséquilibrée mettant un terme à une guerre d’agression, mais les enjeux sont assez semblables : le devenir et l’intégrité d’un pays indépendant, internationalement reconnu.

Une première différence peut être notée : Trump ne joue pas seulement les rôles joints de Chamberlain et de Daladier, mais surtout, ce qui à notre connaissance n’a pas été remarqué, celui de Mussolini, promoteur de la conférence « pour sauvegarder [ici, restaurer] la paix » – un arbitre à la neutralité a priori douteuse.

Bien sûr, le processus qualifié de « négociations » s’étend dans le temps, et son terme n’est pas encore connu. Non seulement Volodymyr Zelensky, le responsable du pays concerné, n’avait pas été au départ pris en compte comme un interlocuteur valable ; au contraire, il a été humilié publiquement devant les télévisions du monde entier, un outrage qui avait été évité à Édouard Bénès.

Là où les Franco-Britanniques avaient essayé de sauver un minimum des intérêts tchécoslovaques, avec la faible efficacité que commandait leur perception du rapport de force, Trump, dirigeant d’un pays qui fut l’allié de l’Ukraine jusqu’à son retour aux affaires, a publiquement pris des positions favorables aux revendications russes, ce qui ne peut qu’encourager Poutine à se montrer plus exigeant. On ne peut que rappeler les travaux qui, comme l’ouvrage de Régis Genté, font état de la longue relation de Trump avec la Russie, en particulier par le soutien financier indirect mais décisif de Moscou à l’époque où les banques américaines refusaient de financer cet entrepreneur immobilier à la solvabilité douteuse, la Deutsche Bank ayant pris le relais sans risque, en raison d’un refinancement assuré auprès de la VTB, la banque du Kremlin.

La réunion entre représentants américains et ukrainiens à Djeddah le 11 mars a constitué une étape importante du processus de négociation : l’Ukraine accepte la proposition américaine d’une trêve de trente jours et les États-Unis reprennent leur assistance militaire. Le secrétaire d’État Marco Rubio a déclaré « Nous allons soumettre cette offre à la Russie. La balle est dans leur camp », tandis que Trump considère que « la Russie a toutes les cartes en mains ».

Compte tenu du contexte antérieur, Poutine peut être incité à considérer cette offre comme un coup de bluff et encouragé à ne pas réduire ses exigences.

On peut penser que Vladimir Poutine tardera à répondre à cette initiative, afin de profiter de conditions militaires favorables et de s’assurer des avantages sur le terrain avant la trêve, et de peser ainsi sur les conditions d’un véritable cessez-le-feu avant même d’éventuelles conditions de paix, ce qui explique l’inquiétude que peut éprouver Zelensky sur la sincérité de Trump – allié incertain ou adversaire de fond prêt à tirer prétexte de succès russes pour exiger de nouvelles concessions de son pays.

Comme l’a indiqué explicitement l’intervention du vice-président des États-Unis J. D. Vance lors de la Conférence sur la Sécurité de Munich en février, au-delà de l’Ukraine c’est l’Europe que la nouvelle administration en place à Washington s’efforce d’affaiblir (ce dont Poutine ne peut que rêver), tout en promouvant dans les pays du Vieux Continent un changement de régime – cette fois-ci, à l’inverse des néoconservateurs des années 2000, en substituant à la démocratie libérale un régime conservateur et autoritaire.

Plus généralement, comme le signalait Genté à la veille de l’élection de novembre 2024, « si Trump est l’homme des Russes, il pourrait bien être le fossoyeur de l’Occident démocratique ».

Et après…

L’après-Munich est connu : faisant fi des accords conclus, Hitler envahit la Tchécoslovaquie le 15 mars 1939 pour achever son démembrement, la Bohème-Moravie devenant un protectorat du Reich et la Slovaquie, un État indépendant sous tutelle allemande.

Nombre d’observateurs craignent, non sans raison, un scénario semblable pour l’Ukraine : au terme d’un délai de quelques mois, ou années, Poutine déciderait de compléter le démantèlement d’une Ukraine auparavant « dénazifiée » et neutralisée. Au contraire d’un Chamberlain qui avait vivement réagi en apportant sa garantie à la Pologne, on peut penser, sur la base même de ses déclarations antérieures et en l’absence d’engagements clairs, que Donald Trump ne réagirait pas, à la seule condition que soient sauvegardés les investissements miniers américains qu’il continue d’exiger de Kiev. Ces concessions minières constitueront-elles dans l’affaire le salaire d’un entremetteur coûteux ou bien une rémunération de la traîtrise, les « deniers de Judas » pour un montant sans commune mesure avec les trente pièces d’argent qu’un officier des gardes-frontières ukrainien avait symboliquement offertes à l’ambassadeur de Biélorussie à son départ, le 18 mars 2022 ?",theconversation

Transmettre en héritage une certaine vision du vivant qui nous entoure peut également être un enjeu pour certains parents. Mais quid de la succession ? En évoquant des particularités légales et culturelles du droit romain, de la culture maorie ou bien de l’organisation sociale basque, le professeur en économie comportementale Sacha Bourgeois-Gironde tâche de voir comment repenser la succession à l’aune des enjeux environnementaux, après avoir consacré un chapitre à cette question dans son ouvrage Comment le droit nous rapproche de la nature (PUF, 2024).

Lier enjeux environnementaux et droits de succession ne va pas forcément de soi. Pourtant les notions d’héritage et de succession ne sont pas étrangères de la pensée écologique, avec notamment cette phrase populaire, « Nous n’héritons pas de la terre de nos parents, nous l’empruntons à nos enfants », dont l’image est beaucoup reprise, notamment comme motivation à agir. Pourquoi d’après vous ?

Sacha Bourgeois-Gironde : Oui, c’est précisément le point d’où je suis parti pour penser la relation entre droits de succession et crise environnementale. Ce poncif de la pensée écologique emprunte à ce lexique de la transmission et de l’héritage, et je l’ai pris au pied de la lettre, tout en sachant qu’il n’y a précisément pas, que ce soit dans la littérature écologique ou dans la littérature juridique, de mise en rapport entre le thème de la responsabilité de la génération présente vis-à-vis des générations futures et la manière dont sont conçus les droits de succession.

Cette citation parle donc d’emprunt dans un sens fort intéressant. Dans une veine utopique soucieuse de la préservation de l’environnement, elle fait de nous des usagers temporaires devant remettre à nos prêteurs (ici « nos enfants ») le bien dans un état similaire à celui dans lequel il nous a été confié. L’idée est simple. Mais elle n’est clairement pas ce qui motive le plus les propriétaires aujourd’hui. La propriété privée est déjà associée à une responsabilité vis-à-vis du bien possédé, de fait, parce que le propriétaire a un intérêt immédiat à ce que son bien soit maintenu en état.

Mais je retiens tout de même une idée potentiellement féconde dans cette citation : l’inversion de l’ordre temporel de la succession. La transmission se ferait du futur au présent, pas du passé vers le présent. En termes simples, cela voudrait dire que les droits de succession devraient être payés par les membres de la génération présente pour le bénéfice de la génération future et, par exemple, être versés à un fonds consacré à la conservation des biens environnementaux que nous avons empruntés à cette génération. L’idée a du sens si l’on considère que ce fonds aurait pour vocation de maintenir en l’état ce que nous avons emprunté.

Pour tâcher d’imaginer un autre rapport à la succession, vous convoquez la notion de droit romain d’hereditas jacens. En quoi consiste-t-elle ?

S. B.-G. : Je trouve en effet intéressant que le droit romain, dont nous sommes les héritiers, ait envisagé un dispositif juridique que l’on peut aujourd’hui mobiliser dans le contexte des droits de la nature. J’ai cherché dans mon livre, Comment le droit nous rapproche de la nature, des sources et des thèmes où des entités naturelles acquéraient des droits subjectifs, devenant sujets de droit, et pas simplement rangées dans la catégorie des objets. La nature est présente, en arrière-plan, dans une variété de domaines du droit, et donc pas seulement dans le droit de l’environnement et, cela va de soi, dans le droit de la propriété, le droit de la succession, le droit des entreprises, le droit de la famille, etc.

Je me suis demandé si des sources ou des arguments relevant de tels domaines pouvaient nous éclairer sur les droits de la nature sans aller puiser dans des emprunts anthropologiques, à des formes d’animisme qu’il faudrait accoutumer à nos systèmes juridiques.

Or, dans la loi romaine de la succession apparaît cette notion de l’hereditas jacens. On peut traduire l’expression par « succession vacante ». L’idée est la suivante : les juristes romains qualifiaient d’hereditas jacens l’intervalle temporel séparant le décès du propriétaire d’un bien foncier et l’acceptation de la succession par les héritiers. Durant ce laps de temps, qui pouvait se prolonger en raison de la difficulté d’identifier les héritiers, ou de l’hésitation de ces derniers quant à l’acceptation de l’héritage, le bien en question revêtait la personnalité juridique du défunt propriétaire.

La formule latine énonce : « Hereditas jacens personam defuncti sustinet », soit, en français, « la succession vacante continue la personne du défunt ». C’est cette interprétation qui m’a marqué. Il y a un état du bien, après la mort de son propriétaire, durant lequel ce bien est susceptible d’être considéré comme une personne juridique. Or, les discussions théoriques autour des droits de la nature portent en grande partie sur le fait de savoir s’il est possible et désirable de conférer la personnalité juridique à des entités naturelles comme les fleuves, les arbres ou les montagnes. C’est ce qui se passe dans le temps de l’hereditas jacens.

Concrètement, comment cette notion pourrait permettre une meilleure prise en compte des enjeux environnementaux au moment de la succession ?

S. B.-G. : L’idée que je propose est de stipuler les clauses d’identification des héritiers et d’acceptation de l’héritage de leur part, présentes dans le concept de droit romain, dans un sens qui offrirait des garanties sur le maintien du bien en bon état, c’est-à-dire dans un état qui préserverait son droit subjectif à l’intégrité qu’il a acquise en devenant, temporairement, une personne juridique.

Cela créerait certaines obligations de la part des héritiers. Mais ces obligations existent déjà en partie. Ce qui est intéressant est de voir en quel sens elles sont le fruit d’un compromis.

La résurrection de l’hereditas jacens, dans le sens que je lui prête, transformerait ce compromis en un dilemme plus pressant. Je m’explique. Il y a une tension fondamentale entre deux concepts juridiques : le droit de propriété, traditionnellement conçu comme un droit individuel absolu, et la protection de l’environnement, qui relève de l’intérêt général et qui a acquis une valeur constitutionnelle via la Charte de l’environnement de 2004.

Les mécanismes traditionnels du droit civil (baux, servitudes classiques) se révèlent insuffisants, car ils sont limités dans le temps ou dans leurs effets. Or, le temps de la biodiversité n’est pas réductible aux intérêts humains et à leur horizon temporel. On note que notre problème, depuis le début, est toujours lié au temps, et on peut saisir intuitivement que les droits de succession conçus comme transmission d’intérêts humains d’une génération à l’autre ne correspondent pas à la prise en compte de la temporalité inhérente à la nature.

Pour répondre à cette problématique, le législateur et la doctrine ont développé plusieurs instruments. Par exemple, l’Obligation réelle environnementale (ORE), créée en 2016, permet au propriétaire de fixer des obligations environnementales transmissibles aux héritiers. Le propriétaire peut choisir librement de grever son bien d’obligations environnementales qui seront transmises à ses ayants droit, comme l’illustre le premier contrat d’ORE patrimoniale signé, le 14 mai 2018, pour une zone humide.

Cette évolution juridique reflète une transformation profonde de la conception de la propriété, que le Pprofesseur de droit privé Benoît Grimonprez qualifie de « propriété-fonction ». La propriété n’est plus une fin en soi, mais un moyen mis au service d’un but. Cette approche permet de réconcilier les impératifs de transmission patrimoniale avec les enjeux de protection environnementale sur le long terme. S’il s’avère ou peut s’avérer que ces enjeux ne seront pas suffisamment pris en compte lors de la succession, le bien foncier pourrait revêtir le statut d’une hereditas jacens et alors, selon les deux interprétations de la notion qu’en donne la doctrine romaine, devenir une personne juridique à part entière dotée d’intérêts propres, ou une res communis, un bien pris en charge par la communauté pour son usage collectif. Un héritier se trouverait face à ce dilemme d’accepter des contraintes environnementales ou de renoncer, au profit de ce bien lui-même, à son héritage.

La prise en compte des enjeux environnementaux peut donc nous amener à repenser le droit de la succession. Mais, inversement, la façon dont nous envisageons la succession peut aussi dire beaucoup de notre rapport à notre environnement. Vous évoquez à cet égard la culture maorie. Pourquoi ?

Car le lien à la nature environnante n’est pas envisagé, dans cette culture, en termes de propriété mais en termes de liens de parenté. Les individus maoris se situent dans une situation de relation généalogique avec des entités naturelles particulières qu’ils peuvent considérer comme leurs ascendants. Le concept maori de whakapapa a pour fonction de préciser la généalogie de chaque personne jusqu’à une origine cosmogonique mythique où des éléments de la nature se mêlent aux lignées humaines.

Cette généalogie permet à une tribu de faire valoir ses droits ancestraux (take tipuna) sur des terres, parce que ces terres font partie de la famille, non pas au sens d’un bien possédé mais en tant que parents. L’intégrité écologique d’un fleuve, dans la mesure où il serait vu comme un ancêtre, est ainsi un corollaire de l’intégrité morale d’un lien familial, du renom et de la réputation de la lignée qui en découle. Le fleuve maori Whanganui a acquis en 2017 la personnalité juridique dans la loi néo-zélandaise. J’ai interprété cette loi moins comme visant directement à la protection environnementale du fleuve que comme relevant d’une forme de droit de la famille élargi à une entité naturelle.

Pour prendre un autre exemple appartenant à une culture complètement différente, le professeur de droit civil Alexandre Zabalza a analysé de quelle manière la maison basque, l’etxe, qui n’est pas un simple lieu d’habitation, mais le principe d’organisation traditionnel de la vie sociale, peut être conçue comme le sujet de droit central à partir duquel repenser les relations entre les humains et leur environnement. On pourrait interpréter le statut de l’etxe en disant que les héritiers d’une maison n’héritent pas la maison, mais la maison les accepte ou non comme héritiers, en ceci qu’elle leur confère leur nom de famille. Il y a une certaine analogie avec le système maori : dans les systèmes-maison (comme les a nommés Lévi-Strauss), comme dans les systèmes-fleuve, les biens, les entités non-humaines déterminent les droits successoraux humains.

En somme, pour que le droit soit à la hauteur des enjeux environnementaux actuels, pas besoin nécessairement de chercher des inspirations lointaines ?

S. B.-G. : Oui, le droit tel qu’il existe, recèle des ressources créatives qui permettraient de changer notre relation à l’environnement, sans qu’on ait nécessairement besoin de s’imaginer que les droits de la nature relèvent d’une révolution juridique radicale. Il s’agit avant tout d’analyser la manière dont une branche du droit donnée implique, dans son arrière-plan, une certaine conception et une certaine relation aux entités de la nature.

Le cas des droits de succession est exemplaire. On peut les reconsidérer à plusieurs niveaux : soit en ajoutant des clauses de protection environnementales lors de la succession, soit en temporisant sur la réalisation de la succession (comme avec le concept romain d’hereditas jacens), soit encore, ce qui est dans la suite logique, en replaçant le bien au centre du mécanisme de succession, plutôt que les héritiers.

L’objectif central d’une réforme des droits de succession, plus généralement, est d’associer la question de la protection environnementale à celle des inégalités, qui préoccupe à juste titre les critiques de l’héritage, autrement dit de repenser nos pratiques juridiques de détail dans le sens d’une justice intergénérationnelle.",theconversation

Pas si sûr, nous explique Jacques Le Cacheux. Le débat qui entoure la question semble cerclé de nombreuses « illusions comptables », méconnaître le fait que les services publics sont nécessairement de plus en plus coûteux, et ignorer le risque d’être entraîné dans un véritable cercle vicieux. Comment faire alors ?

Depuis Roosevelt, il est marqué au fronton du bâtiment du fisc à Washington : « Les impôts sont le prix à payer pour une société civilisée. » Aujourd’hui, vous vous demandez dans vos travaux si les États ont « perdu la bataille de l’impôt » Comment en est-on arrivé là ?

Jacques Le Cacheur : Près d’un siècle s’est écoulé depuis. D’une part, les prélèvements obligatoires ont beaucoup augmenté au XXe siècle dans tous les États développés. D’autre part, une nouvelle idéologie s’est installée dans les années 1980 avec des dirigeants comme Ronald Reagan ou Margaret Thatcher qui ont présenté l’État davantage comme un problème que comme une solution. Ils ont promu son amaigrissement, ce qui a conduit à diaboliser l’impôt avec le concours de certains économistes. Leur argumentaire reste présent dans la tête de nombreux dirigeants qui refusent toute augmentation d’impôt pour ne pas décourager le travail, l’esprit d’entreprise ou l’épargne.

Que penser de ces arguments ? Y a-t-il véritablement un arbitrage à faire entre recette fiscale et croissance, entre justice et compétitivité ?

J. L. C. : Pas nécessairement. Les pays scandinaves ont pendant longtemps démontré qu’une imposition relativement élevée pouvait coexister avec de bons indicateurs macroéconomiques. L’ouvrage Growing public, de Peter Lindert montre, chiffres à l’appui, que les États les plus prospères sont ceux qui ont le plus augmenté la pression fiscale au cours des deux derniers siècles. Dans les pays en développement au contraire, les États n’ont pas de ressources. Car ce qu’omettent souvent les économistes pourfendeurs de l’impôt est qu’il a une contrepartie : il finance une infrastructure publique, transport, éducation ou autre, qui soutient le fonctionnement des grandes économies de marché.

On a tout de même l’impression qu’avec la mobilité des capitaux et la relative capacité qu’ont les ménages et les entreprises à choisir le lieu où ils veulent être imposés, une concurrence fiscale au moins-disant est presque inévitable…

J. L. C. : C’est ce que l’on observe, y compris en Suède où les prélèvements obligatoires ont diminué depuis une trentaine d’années au nom de cet argument. Les États restent assez démunis car ils agissent dans un cadre obsolète, posé dans les années 1920 par la Société des nations. Pour l’amender, une coordination internationale semble émerger ces dernières années avec, en particulier, la taxation minimale des multinationales défendues par l’Organisation de coopération et de développement économiques (OCDE) et adoptée par la majorité des pays. Au G20, à l’initiative du Brésil, on discute d’une taxation des milliardaires à l’échelle mondiale. Certaines grandes fortunes réclament d’ailleurs dans des tribunes d’être taxées davantage. On peut entretenir un petit espoir d’évolution donc, même si à court terme, l’élection de Donald Trump complique la donne… Le problème de la paupérisation des États, que les gilets jaunes ont pour partie rendu visible, est que cela déclenche un cercle vicieux pour le consentement à l’impôt. Si en face de ce qui nous est prélevé se trouvent des services publics dégradés ou inexistants, l’impôt est délégitimé, avec la tentation de les diminuer, pour des services publics de moins bonne qualité encore et ainsi de suite. C’est dangereux pour la démocratie, et la France semble bien avoir mis le doigt dans cet engrenage.

D’autant que la France, réputée très dépensière, ne l’est pas tant que cela si l’on considère ses dépenses hors protection sociale…

J. L. C. : Effectivement. Il y a d’ailleurs aujourd’hui une forme de tyrannie des conventions comptables. Lorsqu’à la Libération, les grands principes de la comptabilité nationale ont été posés, il a été décidé de catégoriser les cotisations sociales parmi les prélèvements obligatoires, ce que l’on assimile à de l’impôt alors que c’est d’une nature différente. Cotiser pour sa propre retraite, c’est une forme d’épargne forcée ; ce n’est pas pareil que l’impôt sur le revenu ou la TVA qui servent à financer pour tous les citoyens l’éducation ou des infrastructures de transport. Ce fétichisme de la norme comptable et le dogme de la pression fiscale conduisent parfois à des situations complètement absurdes. Dans son projet de budget, l’éphémère gouvernement Barnier proposait par exemple de diminuer le taux de remboursement de certaines prestations de santé. Les citoyens seront peut-être contents de la diminution des prélèvements obligatoires qui est liée, mais cela restera une illusion, car ils paieront plus ailleurs, du moins celles et ceux qui le peuvent, en mutuelle. Car il y a là aussi des enjeux d’égalité. D’autant que les mutuelles ont des frais de fonctionnement de 10 %, contre 3 % pour la Sécurité sociale.

L’illusion, on la voit aussi lorsque l’on cite la fable du « jour du dépassement » : à partir de tel jour, moi citoyen, salarié ou entrepreneur, je commence à travailler pour moi et j’arrête de donner à l’État alors que mon homologue américain le fait déjà depuis quelques semaines. C’est oublier que lui a dû, par exemple, payer des frais d’éducation ou de santé bien plus considérables.

Un autre phénomène fait l’objet d’un aveuglement. Les impôts doivent augmenter dans la mesure où le coût des services publics croît nécessairement. Il est majoritairement fait de coûts de main-d’œuvre qualifiée, dans des domaines où il y a peu d’économies d’échelle et de progrès techniques possibles en comparaison à d’autres secteurs. Le coût relatif augmente, donc. Si on veut une éducation de qualité, cela va coûter de plus en plus cher en comparaison aux biens de consommation courante.

Comment, dès lors, sortir de ce cercle vicieux que vous dépeignez en économie ouverte ?

J. L. C. : L’économiste Jan Tinbergen enseignait dans les années 1950 qu’il fallait penser un instrument fiscal par objectif et non vouloir tout cibler avec un seul. Il y a selon moi trois objectifs : la soutenabilité, qu’il s’agisse des comptes publics ou de l’environnement, la compétitivité et l’équité. Pour répondre au premier, il faudrait augmenter la taxation sur la consommation, plus faible en France qu’ailleurs, en mettant l’accent sur les biens les plus nocifs pour l’environnement. Cela permettrait de dégager une manne qui, pour partie, permettrait une diminution de la fiscalité sur le travail, réponse au second objectif.

Mais il faudra, troisième instrument, compenser les effets inégalitaires générés par les deux premiers. Cet aspect est souvent négligé, ce qui explique la grande impopularité de la fiscalité verte, souvent perçue comme une forme d’écologie punitive. Taxer la consommation est aussi souvent perçu comme injuste, car cela pèse pareillement en valeur absolue sur toutes et tous et donc davantage sur les plus précaires proportionnellement au revenu. C’est vrai, mais comme cela est vrai pour la CSG que personne ne remet en cause. Et on oublie souvent de dire qu’on peut le compenser. Le Danemark est un des pays qui a le taux de TVA le plus élevé au monde, 25 % avec très peu de taux réduits, et c’est un des pays les moins inégalitaires au monde car il y a des compensations plus élevées qu’ailleurs. En France, on peut déjà noter que les prestations sociales et le salaire minimum sont indexés sur l’inflation. Si on augmente le niveau général des prix, ces revenus augmenteront aussi et le pouvoir d’achat se maintiendra pour les plus précaires.

Il faut en outre travailler sur la taxation des grandes fortunes en France qui paient en proportion moins d’impôts que les classes moyennes. Il semble qu’il y ait une assez grande méconnaissance de ces sujets parmi la classe politique.

Un aspect oublié, par ailleurs, c’est que ce sont des questions qui se posent aussi à l’échelle européenne…

J. L. C. : Le péché originel réside dans le processus de décision des Vingt-sept. Thomas Sargent avait établi dans sa conférence de remise du prix « Nobel » en 2011 un parallèle entre l’Union européenne (UE) et la seconde Constitution américaine, celle de 1788, encore en place aujourd’hui, qui stipule que « l’État fédéral dispose d’un pouvoir illimité de lever l’impôt ». En Europe, le pouvoir fiscal est resté dans la main des États. Cela implique que les décisions doivent être prises à l’unanimité, ce qui est quasi impossible en matière fiscale en raison des comportements de passagers clandestins qu’ils sont tentés d’adopter. Une occasion a été manquée au moment du traité de Lisbonne que l’on paiera sans doute, maintenant que l’UE a une dette commune à rembourser. Aujourd’hui, le budget européen n’est constitué que des contributions des États membres qui attendent d’en avoir pour leur argent. Avec le même risque de cercle vicieux : une insatisfaction envers Bruxelles, un consentement moindre à payer, une baisse des contributions, etc. Pour financer l’action publique, il faut sortir de cercles vicieux à tous les niveaux.

And it’s important to figure that out, she said, because before you can try to find signs of life in habitable worlds, you need to ask the question: “Do the planets that we can observe with JWST have atmospheres in the first place?”

A Map of the Shoreline

This question captured headlines and the popular imagination in 2017, when astronomers spotted a batch of seven roughly Earth-size planets spinning around the red dwarf star TRAPPIST-1. The unusual planetary system seemed like the perfect alien hunting ground. Not only were three of the planets in the star’s habitable zone, all seven would eventually be within reach of JWST. And by scouring the planets’ atmospheres, astrobiologists hoped to search for the spectral fingerprints of life.

Of course, that would only be possible if these planets had air.

The easiest way to detect an atmosphere is by taking a planet’s temperature, said Jacob Bean, an astronomer at the University of Chicago. By comparing the temperatures on a planet’s day and night sides, as JWST is now doing for hot, rocky worlds, scientists can infer whether an atmosphere distributes heat across the planet.

Initially, when astronomers used JWST to measure the temperatures of TRAPPIST-1 b and c, the system’s innermost planets, they could rule out thick atmospheres — not a surprise, because these worlds fall on the airless side of all three shorelines. Kempton, Bean and their colleagues have also ruled out thick atmospheres on other planets such as Gl 486b and GJ 1132b — both hot, rocky M dwarf planets that Zahnle’s plots suggested would be airless.

However, more recent observations of TRAPPIST-1 b are consistent with either a bare — but geologically active — surface, or a hazy carbon dioxide atmosphere. And JWST observations of a cooler planet, called LTT 1445 A b, are similarly “murky,” Bean said. But this world could be instructive; it falls on opposite sides of the XUV and sunlight shorelines and could help point toward which one matters.

For other cooler worlds like ours, Bean said, finding air requires a different technique.

When a planet passes between its star and Earth, the star’s light briefly shines through any atmosphere that might exist. Astronomers can then sift through that starlight and look for spectral fingerprints that hint at an atmosphere’s composition. But this method, called transit spectroscopy, sometimes has a hard time distinguishing cloudy atmospheres from absent ones, and stellar messiness like sunspots can further complicate interpretations.

Using this method, Lustig-Yaeger and Stevenson are assessing the cosmic shoreline by aiming JWST at five cooler, rocky worlds, including chilly TRAPPIST-1 h. So far, they’ve published observations of four worlds that sit close to the total sunlight shoreline but are deep within the XUV shoreline’s airless desert. Two look airless, but a thin, hazy or cloudy atmosphere might have escaped detection. The other two show hints of steamy atmospheres, but these observations could be just as easily explained by sunspots.

Undoubtedly, finding atmospheres on small alien worlds is a challenge. But atmosphere hunters are confident they can meet it with JWST. By starting with hot rocks that are easier to observe and then refining their methods, “we can get down to planets that straddle where we think the cosmic shoreline is,” Kempton said, “and map out where that boundary is.”

Life on the Cosmic Beach

Even though scientists are hunting for the cosmic shoreline, some — including Zahnle — also recognize that the concept is probably an oversimplification. It ignores the amount of air that planets start out with. It assumes that escape is all that matters. It also assumes that if a planet loses its atmosphere, it loses it permanently.

Reality is likely much more complex. The cosmic shoreline is probably less of a tidy fence and more of a wild borderland, said Joshua Krissansen-Totton, a planetary scientist at the University of Washington. Notably, his computer models of planets around M dwarfs suggest that they can regain lost atmospheres over time.

“Just because there’s enhanced loss doesn’t necessarily mean that these planets end up airless,” he said. Instead, he said, an atmosphere on an older planet is a complex function of a planet’s evolution and its starting conditions.

Zahnle agrees. “It’s the usual question of nature versus nurture,” he said. “Of course the answer is nature and nurture.”

Regardless of whether the cosmic shoreline is a neat divide or a fuzzier boundary, it has important consequences for our understanding of life in the universe.

Beyond the solar system, 70% of the stars in our galaxy are M dwarfs — systems that have often been framed as “galactic real estate for habitability,” Bean said. If M dwarfs inevitably blast away their planets’ atmospheres, that real estate won’t be all that real, after all. Depending on what JWST finds, the search for life’s atmospheric fingerprints could start now. Or it might need to wait for the next generation of space-based observatories, decades in the future, to hunt for biosignatures in the atmospheres of Earth-like worlds.

As the hunt for the cosmic shoreline shows, learning anything at all about exoplanets is still enormously difficult. But the multitude of exoplanets offers one undeniable advantage — numbers. We’ll never fit a solar system into a lab flask, but we don’t have to. The universe has made a lot of worlds, each its own experiment in planet formation.

“That,” Bean said, “is the promise of extrasolar planets.”",quantamagazine
https://undark.org,Rural Texas Scrambles to Respond to Measles,https://undark.org/2025/03/12/texas-measles-public-health/,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Five years ago, Melanie Richburg used a roll of duct tape, a HEPA filter, and a portable fan to draw contaminated air out of a hospital room where patients were tested for the coronavirus.

Now, as the state’s largest measles outbreak in three decades sickens an increasing number of Texans in the South Plains region, the Lynn County Hospital District, where Richburg serves as the chief executive officer, is still without specialized isolation rooms to treat patients.

So, she’s prepared to bring out the duct tape again.

Related Coming of Age Unvaccinated

“If we see the volume of patients exceeds the number of beds available at children’s hospitals, we’re going to need a contingency plan,” said Richburg, whose county is 30 miles south of Lubbock and has had two measles cases. “The biggest struggle we have is the same struggle we had during Covid.”

The coronavirus pandemic underscored the need for robust public health infrastructure. And it brought to light a remarkable urban-rural divide in access to basic health services. In the months after the virus ravaged the country, federal dollars flowed to local public health districts, and policies targeting health care deserts saw a renewed push.

Yet as a disease that had been declared eliminated from the U.S. in 2000 makes a resurgence, rural West Texas communities and state officials are scrambling to respond. Aging infrastructure, a dearth of primary care providers, and long distances between testing sites and laboratories plague much of rural Texas, where the measles outbreak has concentrated.

As of Tuesday, at least 223 people in Texas have been infected with measles since late January, and one child has died from measles, the first such death in the country in a decade.

“The biggest struggle we have is the same struggle we had during Covid.”

More measles cases are expected, and the outbreak could last for months, state health services commissioner Jennifer Shuford told lawmakers last week.

Though different from Covid in many ways, measles is similarly revealing how a lack of public health resources leaves rural communities vulnerable. What’s left are local leaders forced to scrape together the few tools they have to respond to an emergency, contending with years of lackluster investment from the state and federal level to proactively prevent emerging public health threats.

“We’re in a public health shortage area,” said Gordon Mattimoe, director of the Andrews County Health Department. “You have to think outside the box.”

Some 64 Texas counties don’t have a hospital, and 25 lack primary care physicians, according to the Texas Department of Agriculture. Twenty-six rural Texas hospitals closed between 2010 and 2020, according to a rural hospital trade organization, and although closures slowed in the years since, those still standing are often in crumbling buildings with few medical providers.

Swaths of Texas have scant resources for public awareness campaigns. And they lack sufficient medical staff with expertise to provide the one-on-one education needed to encourage vaccination and regular visits to the doctor.

“We have a difficult time in our area finding pediatricians for our newborns,” said Sara Safarzadeh Amiri, chief medical officer for Odessa Regional Medical Center and Scenic Mountain Medical Center. “That’s a problem. If you can’t find a pediatrician, then when a serious question comes up, who do you ask?”

Most of Texas’ measles cases are in unvaccinated school-aged children and are concentrated in the Mennonite community in Gaines County. Cases have also been confirmed in eight other counties spanning Dallam, near the Oklahoma border, down to Ector, south of Gaines.

To contain the illness, rural health care teams have cordoned off spaces to conduct measles testing, used social media to blast residents with information about vaccination efficacy, and schlepped throat swabs across counties to ship them to a state lab in Austin — the only public state facility that was conducting measles testing until the Texas Tech University Bioterrorism Response Laboratory, part of a national network of CDC-funded labs, began measles testing last Monday.

Testing is critical for measles, experts say, because infected individuals can be contagious for several days and must isolate themselves to avoid spreading it further.

In Gaines County, runners have had to drive specimens up to 70 miles to get to a FedEx office where they could ship the specimen to the state laboratory. It could then take another 48 hours to get test results. During that time, public health officials would ask patients suspected of measles to quarantine — but they don’t know if they followed through.

“Some people need the test to say ‘I’m positive’ before they actually do something or follow the directions given,” Amiri said. “Having that testing available is very important.”

Public health officials would ask patients suspected of measles to quarantine — but they don’t know if they followed through.

In Andrews County, just south of Gaines, Mattimoe is using the old City Hall building as a testing site because he doesn’t have a reverse pressure room.

Those rooms prevent contagious diseases from spreading to other people, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends suspected measles patients are treated there when possible. In the absence of such spaces, rural counties including Lynn and Yoakum have improvised a room for measles testing, hoping they don’t get overrun with more patients they can handle.

Mattimoe, who said he is anticipating more cases, opted to open up City Hall for testing since that building happens to be vacant.

Without it, Mattimoe said, he’d have to “shut down the entire department for two hours between suspected cases.”

Public health is based upon prevention, yet it’s emergencies that spur the most action, particularly in rural communities.

It was only after a school-aged child died from measles that state and federal support intensified. Twenty seven contractors were brought into the outbreak area last week to assist local health departments, Shuford, the state health services commissioner, said during a legislative hearing. A public awareness campaign with billboards and social media messaging was also launched. And, upon a request from the state, the federal CDC sent “disease detectives” to West Texas.

Related Measles and the Anatomy of Containment

County officials also doubled down their efforts. In Ector County, County Judge Dustin Fawcett made media appearances to discuss the efficacy of the MMRV vaccine whose two doses provide 97 percent protection against measles. And the commissioners court approved the purchase of a $7,695 freezer to store measles test specimens — samples shipped after the date of collection must be kept at -70 degrees Celsius.

In Andrews County, residents stepped up their communal responsibilities. Mattimoe saw a surge of people coming into the clinic to get vaccinated. “Unfortunately, the death of a child was one of the things that spurred many people to come in,” Mattimoe said.

Even as state and federal officials are sharing more information on vaccines, experts say those campaigns needed to come sooner. They have known for years that vaccination rates have been declining.

“We shouldn’t be doing it during an outbreak,” Amiri said. “We should be doing it beforehand to prevent the outbreak.”

Getting vaccines in residents is further complicated by the fact that Texas has a mostly decentralized system of public health. Cities and counties can stand up their own public health departments or districts, but the majority of rural counties can’t afford to have their own. Instead, they rely on one of 11 public health regions.

Those regions cover vast territories with limited dollars and don’t always know the ins and outs of local communities, especially on how to motivate residents to get vaccinated. The logistical challenges of traveling across counties adds another layer of difficulty.

“Unfortunately, the death of a child was one of the things that spurred many people to come in.”

“You have to call these tiny towns and figure out who can give you space for free to set up a testing clinic,” Wells said. “Then you’re driving from Lubbock to rural areas and that cuts how long you can keep the clinics open.”

And then, rural public health departments are having to contend with mixed messaging from the federal level as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Health and Human Services secretary, has cast vaccination as a personal choice while downplaying the news of the outbreak.

“I think with the changes that are occurring at the federal level, we need to realize that we do need to strengthen our local public health,” Amiri said.

Years of underinvestment in public health left Texas ill prepared for the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. Hospital equipment was scarce, and state and local health departments had outdated technology that limited access to crucial data.

The pandemic also exposed the rural-urban inequities in health care access. Residents of Texas counties without hospitals died from Covid-19 at 20 percent higher rates than residents of counties with hospitals, according to an analysis by the Austin American Statesman.

An influx in federal funding helped shore up local public health departments and stave off more rural hospital closures. Texas received $35.5 million in grants for improvements in public health infrastructure in fiscal year 2020. An additional $221 million — the most of any state — is flowing to Texas through the CDC’s five-year Public Health Infrastructure Grant.

Texas spent $17 per person on public health in 2023. A decade earlier, the spend was $19.

That funding has helped some local health departments address the measles outbreak, public health officials said. The Lubbock public health department has nearly doubled in size thanks to a $2 million grant. Those extra workers have been on the front lines of testing for measles and vaccinating children.

“It moved us from undersized to right sized,” said Katherine Wells, director of the city’s public health department. “It got us to the […] health department we need for Lubbock.”

In Andrews County, Mattimoe has also used grant dollars to grow his health department. Four new employees, including an epidemiologist and a social worker, have helped the county complete a population health assessment that offers a snapshot of residents’ needs. And its year-round vaccine clinics have helped stave off the worst of the measles outbreak.

“Community immunity has really saved us,” Mattimoe said. “There will be a case eventually, but there’s something to be said about herd immunity.” Andrews County does not have any confirmed measles cases as of Friday.

The influx of dollars that rural communities received during the height of the pandemic showed the meaningful changes that officials could do with more support, but it still hasn’t been enough.

Texas spends less on public health per person than the vast majority of other states, according to the State Health Access Data Assistance Center, whose analysis shows Texas spent $17 per person on public health in 2023. A decade earlier, the spend was $19.

The low levels of state funding particularly hurt rural communities that have higher rates of uninsured Texans and more senior citizens with greater health needs, according to the Texas Organization of Rural and Community Hospitals. Deteriorating buildings and the shortage of medical professionals still persist in rural areas, while lower volumes of patients means higher health care operational costs.

In Lynn County, Richburg, the CEO of the health district, had hoped the makeshift contraption she made during Covid for a reverse pressure room wouldn’t be needed again in her rural community of 5,500 people. She attempted to pass a bond last year to pay for infrastructure upgrades, including a mini intensive care unit with four negative pressure rooms.

Voters rejected the proposed tax increase, though, a gut punch to Richburg.

“There will be a case eventually, but there’s something to be said about herd immunity.”

“We wanted those four specific beds so that when we had situations where we needed to isolate patients, they’d be adequately cared for and not in a room with a broken window with a fan duct taped in it,” she said.

In addition to isolation rooms, Lynn County’s health care system is due for a major electrical upgrade, Richburg said. The facility’s backup power generator doesn’t cover the MRI machine or the CAT scan. In the meantime, Richburg and her staff plan to do their best with what they have.

“We’re still here, the lights still come on every morning, and patients still come in for services,” Richburg said. “We’re not going away.”
