My boys are now in middle school, and in hindsight, I can tell you with certainty that those early school years were the hardest to manage.

At that age, children are still putting everything in their mouths. Kids are really too young to fully understand their food allergies or advocate for themselves. And the mess! It is age-appropriate for youngsters to eat and play while leaving a path of destruction behind them. This is all fine, unless, of course, the mess includes your child’s food allergen.

Thankfully, I’m far on the other side now. That said, I still clearly remember my fear, stress, and worry during those years. A big part of the problem was that I didn’t know what to request of the school in order to make the classroom as safe as possible for my boys. How could I, as a first-time preschool parent and first-time food allergy parent? However, I have learned so many important lessons. I’m happy to share my top three tips with you about how to safely get your child with food allergies through the first school years.",webmd

I absorb a lot of this information in my role at Young Survival Coalition (YSC) and by attending conferences like the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS). One particularly exciting development at SABCS this past December was the “First Look” report of Project 528. I must admit, I’m biased – not only did I participate in the survey, but I also played a small role in bringing it to the world.

Project 528 – named for the estimated 528,018 young adults living with breast cancer – is the first global needs assessment of young women diagnosed with breast cancer, their caregivers, and the health care providers who support them. I’ve read the report three times now, and each time, a different statistic jumps out at me. This comprehensive survey covered topics such as demographics, diagnosis history, breast cancer education, supportive services, quality of life, financial impact, mental health, and access to clinical trials.

This is how the heart makes a duet of wonder and grief.

– Mark Nepo

As I step into my 50th year, I’m focused on integrating the woman I used to be with the woman I’m becoming. The friction of being and becoming as I engage with the world as a wife, daughter, sister, coach, co-worker, and friend chafes me daily. I’m rubbed raw inside by trying to keep it all neatly laced together.

Much of my inner work of these last years has been an unlearning of these dutiful roles and an embracing of an emerging self who is breaking free from the limitations and expectations of showing up in a prescribed way. The mutation of these identities is as painful as my newfound freedom is blissful. Healing old pain has opened me to new pain. And new joy.

Sometimes I’m breaking new trails with confidence. And in many instances, I’m utterly lost as to how to lean into this journey with integrity, let alone grace. So many naturally encrusted aspects of an outmoded self have chipped away. The raw newness is an almost daily shock of meeting myself for the first time: as a well person, a balanced, sober person, and contented person. A healed person, a person with boundaries and self-respect. And also a person who has struggled alone with her pain for a lifetime.",webmd

https://news-medical.net,Study reveals how the brain tracks complex social interactions,https://news-medical.net/news/20250312/Study-reveals-how-the-brain-tracks-complex-social-interactions.aspx,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Our brains use basic 'building blocks' of information to keep track of how people interact, enabling us to navigate complex social interactions, finds a new study led by University College London (UCL) researchers.

For the study, published in Nature, the researchers scanned the brains of participants who were playing a simple game involving a teammate and two opponents, to see how their brains were able to keep track of information about the group of players.

The scientists found that rather than keeping track of the performance of each individual player, specific parts of the participants' brains would react to specific patterns of interaction, or 'building blocks' of information that could be combined to understand what was going on.

Humans are social creatures that are capable of keeping track of highly complex and fluid social dynamics, requiring a massive amount of brain power to remember not only individual people but also the various relationships between them. In order to keep up with a group social interaction in real time, our brains must be using heuristics – mental shortcuts that help people make decisions quickly – to compress and simplify the wealth of information involved, with a system that minimises complexity while still allowing flexibility and detail. In this research, we found that our brains appear to use a set of basic 'building blocks' that represent fundamental aspects of social interactions, enabling us to quickly figure out new and complex social situations."" Dr. Marco Wittmann, Lead Author, UCL Psychology & Language Sciences and Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research

For the study, the team of scientists from UCL and the University of Oxford used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to record the brain activity of 88 participants who were playing a simple game. While in the scanner, the study participants were given a series of information about how they, a partner, and their opponents were faring in a game, and needed to keep track of the information in order to answer a question comparing performances of different players.

Dr Wittmann explained: ""We were interested to see whether our brains would use an 'agent-centric' frame of reference where specific parts of the brain keep track of each player's performance, or a 'sequential' frame of reference tracking the information in the order it was received. We found that people actually do both, but our brains are able to simplify all of this information into bite-sized chunks.""

The scientists were able to pinpoint specific patterns of activity in the brain that represented a few specific 'building blocks', each representing a pattern of interaction between the players.

For example, one building block kept information about how well a participant and their partner were doing relative to the other team. A bigger difference in performance between the two teams corresponded to an increase in brain activity related to this building block. These specific patterns of activity were found in the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in decision-making and social behaviour.

The researchers say these fundamental building blocks appear to represent patterns of interaction that are common to many different situations.

Dr Wittmann said: ""As we develop social skills in life, our brains are likely learning specific interaction patterns that we come across again and again. These patterns may become hard-wired into our brains as building blocks that get assembled and recombined to construct our understanding of any social setting.""",news-medical
https://news-medical.net,Innovative gel prevents post-surgery adhesions in animal models,https://news-medical.net/news/20250312/Innovative-gel-prevents-post-surgery-adhesions-in-animal-models.aspx,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Surgical adhesions - common, sometimes life-threatening complications that arise after open or laparoscopic abdominal surgery - can be prevented in mice and pigs by a gel impregnated with a molecule that blocks a key signaling pathway in the formation of scar tissue.

The gel can be applied as a spray or a wash to the inside of the abdominal cavity immediately after surgery. Over a period of two weeks, the gel releases a small molecule, T-5224, that blocks the activation of adhesion-forming cells called fibroblasts without affecting normal wound healing.

A practical, simple way to prevent or reduce the formation of post-surgical abdominal adhesions in humans, which are currently unpreventable and largely untreatable, could save billions of dollars in health care costs each year and significantly reduce the incidences of chronic pain, infertility and bowel obstructions that arise when adhesions are severe, the researchers believe. Showing success in large animals such as pigs is a key step toward human clinical trials.

Adhesions happen primarily when you injure or interact with the bowel during surgery, whether the surgery is open or laparoscopic. This gel reduces the likelihood of adhesions without compromising the ability of the animal to heal after surgery. And, as a surgeon, I'm already used to washing out the surgical site at the end of the procedure, so this would be easy to incorporate into our normal workflow."" Michael Longaker, MD, professor of surgery

Longaker, the Deane P. and Louise Mitchell Professor in the School of Medicine, and assistant professor of surgery Daniel Delitto, MD, PhD, are the senior authors of the study, which was published March 12 in Science Translational Medicine. Former postdoctoral scholar and surgical resident Deshka Foster, MD, PhD, and postdoctoral scholar Jason Guo, PhD, are the lead authors of the research.

The problem with scar tissue

Abdominal adhesions form in the weeks after surgery as the body heals. Between 50% and 90% (depending upon the type and location of the surgery) of abdominal surgeries result in adhesions, characterized by excessive scar tissue that tethers organs and tissues to one another or to the abdominal wall.

Although many adhesions cause no symptoms, between 5% and 20% are severe, causing chronic pain, infertility and life-threatening bowel obstructions. There is no reliable method to prevent or treat them, and complications from abdominal adhesions are estimated to cost billions of health care dollars each year.

Longaker, Foster and their colleagues have been studying scar formation and adhesions for many years. In 2020 they identified the biological pathway responsible for adhesion formation in mice and humans and showed that inhibiting the activity of a protein called c-Jun - produced by fibroblasts in response to injury - substantially reduced the formation of adhesions in laboratory mice.

The inhibitory molecule, called T-5224, had been identified for its ability to modulate the excessive scarring and inflammation, and has been tested in clinical trials as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and in animal models of cancer metastasis and inflammation.

""We wanted to learn whether we could deliver this small molecule inhibitor directly to the abdominal cavity over a period of several days and, if so, whether it would impact adhesion formation,"" Longaker said.

The researchers collaborated with study co-author and associate professor of materials science and engineering Eric Appel, PhD, to design a biomaterial called a shear-thinning hydrogel that flows like a liquid under pressure - such as being forced through a syringe - but stabilizes when the force is removed. When the gel is impregnated with T-5224, it slowly releases the small molecule over 14 days.

When tested in mice and minipigs, the T-5224-impregnated gel significantly reduced the formation of adhesions - scored from 0 to 5 by the degree of contact between neighboring tissues - by nearly 300% in response to abdominal surgery compared with animals that received a saline wash of the surgical site or application of the gel without T-5224.

""The sustained release formulation of T-5224-hydrogel and the ability to easily apply it to the abdominal cavity are ideal qualities for a potential clinical therapy for adhesions,"" Foster said. ""We are eager to take the next steps to bring this approach into the clinic.""

""It's great to find a treatment to block adhesions,"" Longaker said. ""But more importantly, we saw no effect on wound healing. If we prevent adhesions, but the bowel falls apart or the abdominal opening doesn't close properly because of the treatment, it wouldn't be usable. Now we have enough data in a large animal model showing that this is a safe and effective treatment to talk about launching trials in people.""

The study was supported by the National Institutes of Health (grants 1F32CA239312-01, 1F32HL167318, 1R01GM116892, 1R01GM136659 and T32GM008412), the National Science Foundation, Stanford SPARK Program, the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation, the John and Marva Warnock Faculty Scholar Award, the Emerson Collective/Goldman Sachs Foundation, Stanford's Child Health Research Institute, Stanford's Transplant and Tissue Engineering Center of Excellence, the Gunn/Olivier Fund, the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, and the Wu Tsai Human Performance Alliance.

https://news-medical.net,Impact of excessive alcohol consumption on digestive health,https://news-medical.net/news/20250312/Impact-of-excessive-alcohol-consumption-on-digestive-health.aspx,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Excessive alcohol consumption is a significant public health concern, responsible for approximately 6% of all deaths and contributing to 5.1% of the global disease burden. Alcohol use is a major risk factor for over 200 diseases, including liver cirrhosis, pancreatitis, and esophageal cancer, with a particularly high incidence of gastrointestinal diseases. More than 50% of alcohol-related deaths are caused by gastrointestinal diseases, highlighting the importance of understanding how ethanol affects the digestive system. This review aims to provide an overview of ethanol metabolism and the diseases caused by alcohol consumption, with a focus on the liver, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, and gallbladder.

Liver

The liver plays a central role in ethanol metabolism, absorbing about 90% of ingested alcohol. Ethanol is metabolized to acetaldehyde via alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), and acetaldehyde is further metabolized to acetate, which eventually leads to the production of carbon dioxide and water. Acetaldehyde, a highly toxic compound, can damage liver cells, causing conditions such as steatosis, steatohepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Chronic alcohol consumption accelerates liver damage, and risk factors like genetic polymorphisms and the type of alcohol consumed play important roles in disease progression. Females, in particular, are more susceptible to alcohol-induced liver damage due to differences in alcohol metabolism and body composition.

Gastrointestinal tract

The gastrointestinal tract is often the first to show damage from excessive alcohol consumption, which can cause both reversible and irreversible lesions. Alcohol can lead to stomatitis, periodontal disease, and alterations in the oral microbiota. In the esophagus, alcohol's toxic effects contribute to esophagitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and an increased risk of esophageal cancer, particularly when combined with smoking. Alcohol also affects gastric motility and mucosal integrity, contributing to conditions like gastritis, peptic ulcers, and eventually gastric cancer. Chronic alcohol use can impair intestinal barrier function, leading to ""leaky gut,"" dysbiosis, and nutrient malabsorption. These changes increase the risk of diarrhea and contribute to colorectal cancer development.

Pancreas

Alcohol misuse is a leading cause of pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis (AP) and chronic pancreatitis are common consequences of alcohol consumption. In AP, excessive alcohol intake leads to inflammation and pancreatic tissue damage, while chronic pancreatitis involves persistent inflammation, fibrosis, and pancreatic insufficiency. The pathophysiology of alcohol-induced pancreatitis is multifactorial, involving both direct toxic effects on pancreatic cells and indirect effects through the activation of inflammatory and fibrotic pathways. Pancreatic cancer is also a severe consequence of long-term alcohol abuse, with alcohol serving as a cofactor in the disease's development, particularly when combined with smoking.

Gallbladder

Alcohol consumption is associated with an increased risk of gallstones and gallbladder disease. Alcohol can alter bile composition, contributing to the formation of gallstones, and chronic alcohol use can lead to gallbladder inflammation, resulting in conditions like cholecystitis. Additionally, alcohol abuse can exacerbate pre-existing gallbladder issues by increasing oxidative stress and promoting the secretion of inflammatory cytokines.

Gastrointestinal tumors

Alcohol is a significant risk factor for various gastrointestinal cancers, particularly those in the esophagus, stomach, and colon. Ethanol metabolism produces acetaldehyde, a potent carcinogen that can damage DNA, inhibit DNA repair, and shorten telomeres, contributing to carcinogenesis. Alcohol consumption, particularly in combination with smoking, significantly increases the risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and gastric cancer. It is also associated with an elevated risk of colorectal cancer through mechanisms like DNA methylation induced by alcohol.

Discussion

Chronic alcohol consumption results in a broad spectrum of damage across the digestive system, from the oral cavity to the rectum. The severity of damage depends on factors such as the amount and frequency of alcohol intake, genetic predisposition, and the presence of other risk factors. The interaction of alcohol with other drugs, particularly in women, can further exacerbate its harmful effects. Acetaldehyde and endotoxemia triggered by alcohol intake play critical roles in liver damage, leading to conditions like cirrhosis and liver cancer. Early detection and management of alcohol-induced damage are essential to prevent progression to more severe conditions like pancreatitis, cirrhosis, and cancer.

Conclusions

Minimizing alcohol intake is crucial for digestive health. Social drinking, defined as up to one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men, is considered the safest approach. Individuals with alcohol use disorder should seek professional support and management to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal damage. Immediate medical evaluation is recommended for patients who present with persistent digestive symptoms linked to excessive alcohol consumption.",news-medical

Neurogenic bladder, also called neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction, often occurs after a spinal cord injury. The spinal cord helps coordinate bladder storage and voiding. The neurogenic bladder that occurs after a spinal cord injury can lead to discoordination of normal bladder function, resulting in involuntary bladder muscle contractions which can cause overactive bladder symptoms like frequency, urgency, and incontinence, and can even lead to urinary tract infections and permanent kidney injury.

The therapy is a nonmultiplying gene therapy vector, or transporter, which is a modified form of the herpes virus. This vector carries the gene encoding the active part of botulinum toxin, which it will make in the spinal cord to block the sensory nerve signals that result in involuntary bladder contractions. The therapy is named EG110A by its developer EG 427, a biotechnology company.

They have modified the herpes virus, which affects nerves, so that it is not virulent and does not multiply, and are relying on its innate ability to travel along nerve cells and reside in the sensory cells by the spinal cord. Once the vector is in place, it will manufacture its medication. It will block the sensory signals in the spinal cord that cause reflexive bladder contractions. This is the science fiction stuff that I dreamed about as an undergrad."" Argyrios Stampas, MD, MS, lead investigator for the Houston site of the trial and associate professor, Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation in McGovern Medical School, UTHealth Houston

Current treatment with BOTOX® for neurogenic bladder requires multiple injections, as many as 30, into the detrusor muscle of the bladder every six months. Preclinical study results showed that EG110A could last for several years.

""When people living with spinal cord injury are surveyed, bowel and bladder issues are their top priority,"" said Stampas, director of Spinal Cord Injury Medicine Research at TIRR Memorial Hermann. ""The opportunity to have one procedure that could relieve incontinence for years would be a huge improvement on their quality of life.""

The 52-week, Phase Ib/IIa clinical trial will enroll people from 18 to 75 years of age who are at least 12 months post-spinal cord injury. The trial includes a five-year safety follow-up period. Because it is a first-in-human study, an overnight hospital stay is required after the bladder injections. Visit-related expenses are reimbursed. The drug has received investigational new drug clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

This is because it specifically targets the cancer cells, which reduces the side effects seen with more conventional therapies.

Tumors, such as some breast and ovarian cancers, can express the marker HER2. HER2 is responsible for cancer growth and is the target of existing therapies, such as the most commonly used type of antibodies, IgG. However, this treatment is not always effective in some patients.

Now scientists have investigated a different antibody type, IgE, which activates the patient's immune system in different ways to IgG. As they act on different immune cells to IgG, IgE antibodies uniquely stimulate otherwise inactive immune cells in the 'microenvironment' surrounding the tumor to directly target the cancer cells.

In the study, led by Dr Heather Bax at King's College London, the team engineered IgE versions of existing IgG therapies, and tested their ability to activate immune cells against HER2-expressing cancer cells.

IgE was shown to direct immune cells against HER2-expressing cancer cells, and slowed tumor growth in mice. The tumors grown in mice are known to be resistant to conventional treatments, suggesting this new treatment could be an option for patients who don't respond to existing therapy.

Further investigation revealed that IgE antibodies stimulated and reprogrammed the 'immune microenvironment' around the tumors themselves – shifting from an immunosuppressive to an immunostimulatory response. This means the immune system was activated to target the cancer cells, and to overcome the actions of the tumor to suppress attack.

The study, published in Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer (JITC), with funding from Breast Cancer Now, has shown the potential of IgE as a new therapy for HER2-expressing cancers, including those resistant to other treatments. The researchers believe that, with the right investment and development, this approach could be used in humans in as soon as 3-5 years.

Around 20% of breast and ovarian cancers express the marker, HER2. By generating anti-HER2 IgE antibodies equivalent to the clinically used IgGs, for the first time we demonstrate that IgEs harness unique mechanisms to reprogramme the immune microenvironment, switching immune cells to effectively target HER2-expressing cancers, including those resistant to existing therapies. Our findings indicate that IgE antibodies could offer a potential new therapy option for patients with HER2-expressing cancer."" Dr. Heather Bax, Senior Author, Postdoctoral Research Fellow in St. John's Institute of Dermatology, King's College London

Co-Author Professor Sophia Karagiannis, Professor of Translational Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy, in St. John's Institute of Dermatology, at King's College London, added: ""By generating a panel of IgE antibodies and studying them in different tumor types, we consistently found that the human immune system reacts in the presence of IgE to restrict the growth of cancer.

""The findings of our latest study speak to the potential of applying IgE to stimulate effective responses against hard-to-treat solid tumors. This new class of drugs holds promise to benefit different patient groups and opens a new frontier in the battle against cancer.""

Dr Kotryna Temcinaite, head of research communications and engagement at Breast Cancer Now, who provided funding for the study, said: ""This exciting research could lead to much-needed new treatments for people with HER2 positive breast cancer whose cancers don't respond to existing therapies. Now we know that the treatment works in principle in mice, researchers can continue to develop this immunotherapy to make it suitable for people, as well as to understand the full effect it could have and who it may benefit the most.""",news-medical

How is smart bed technology transforming patient care?

Challenges experienced by manufacturers

How can we enhance smart bed use in the future?

Smart hospital beds provide greater benefits beyond the place to rest for patients. These beds are equipped with a myriad of sensors and monitors that enable real-time monitoring of a patient’s vital signs, including heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, body temperature, and movements.1

Therefore, sophisticated hospital beds not only enhance patients’ comfort but also provide invaluable information about their clinical condition to healthcare professionals, enabling them to deliver medical attention promptly.

Smart vs. traditional hospital beds

Traditional hospital beds were designed to provide a place for patients to rest while they were being treated. Mostly, these beds are static, with limited or no available adjustments for patients' positioning or comfort. This lack of adaptability may not only cause discomfort but also lead to complications that could lead to prolonged hospital stays.2

Smart hospital beds are innovative beds integrated with advanced features and functionalities that provide significant comfort and safety for patients.3

The adjustable modes enable them to find the most comfortable position for sleeping, resting, or engaging in activities like watching television or reading. Certain smart beds are also equipped with built-in massage functions to relieve pain.

Automated electric beds, built in the 1990s, underwent continual improvements through applications of modern research and technologies, including Internet of Things (IoT) devices, sensors, ergonomics, pressure layers, and built-in scales.4

Smart beds are developed by integrating technology and communications, such as computer vision, artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning, deep learning methods, and the IoT for rapid and precise monitoring of patients.5

Unlike traditional hospital beds, smart beds transmit clinical data wirelessly to healthcare providers, enabling them to closely monitor patients and provide immediate attention if any abnormalities are detected.4

Smart beds exploit technologies, such as graphical interfaces and actuators, to provide a higher level of service, including real-time monitoring.

Besides real-time monitoring of clinical data through sensors and IoT, current smart hospital beds are equipped with alarm systems to alert supervisors in case of abnormal event detection in patients.6

Advanced smart beds are designed to automatically update the patient’s medical record with all the acquired data, including the number of times the patient has been repositioned or left their beds.

How is smart bed technology transforming patient care?

A combination of multiple technologies, including machine learning, a sensor network, a morphable tile-like surface, and computer support for data analysis, risk assessment, and alerts, has offered real-time monitoring of patient’s vital signs, including respiratory rate, heart rate, and blood pressure, which helps prevent adverse outcomes.

For example, an abnormal elevation in body temperature indicates the risks of sepsis; therefore, these patients would require immediate assessment and intervention.7 Similarly, continual cardiorespiratory rate monitoring is essential for patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or those with sleep disorders to detect a life-threatening situation.

Smart beds equipped with a smart Fiber Bragg Grating (FGB) sensor system can automatically detect the behavior of bedridden patients and their vital signs.8 This system can effectively prevent patients from falling out of bed, bed soreness, and life-threatening situations (e.g., elevated heart rate).

Typically, the FGB interrogator is connected to a computer and an alarm system to alert medical professionals in case of abnormal clinical data.

A low-cost magnetic induction system has been designed to be placed underneath the bed mattress, which can detect a patient’s presence on the bed by monitoring his cardiorespiratory rate.

Ultra-wideband (UWB) sensors have been used for non-obtrusive sensing of vital parameters. These unobtrusive depth sensors have enabled remote monitoring of patient’s movement in their bed. This pressure-sensing architecture helps monitor the sleep quality of patients.8

Mapping pressure points on a patient’s body has also proved to be beneficial in determining whether a bed is occupied or not. This information is crucial in every care facility to detect whether a patient has fallen off the bed or tried to get out of it without assistance.

Deep learning and machine learning algorithms have also been applied to assess heartbeat signals generated by a 3D solid-state accelerometer embedded into a smart bed.9

Patients with medical conditions that limit their ability to change positions are at a high risk of developing bedding ulcers. The use of smart beds has reduced the incidence of pressure or bedding ulcers, which are skin injuries that occur due to prolonged pressure.1

Pressure sensors monitor and detect pressure over the entire patient’s body, modeling constructs pressure maps, and machine learning predicts the risks of developing pressure ulcers. This data helps medical staff to take prompt action to prevent pressure ulcers.

Challenges experienced by manufacturers

Stryker Corporation, Paramount Bed, Hill-Rom Holdings, Joerns Healthcare, Stiegelmeyer, Getinge Group, and Invacare Corporation are considered key players in the medical smart bed market.10

Despite the benefits, the limited adoption of smart beds and their restrictive market growth have been attributed to their high cost, regulatory hurdles, and data privacy concerns.

Furthermore, the majority of research has been conducted on prototypes rather than on real hospital beds, which limits the generalizability of the findings to actual clinical settings.8

Hospital-at-Home: Bridging Inpatient and Remote Care

How can we enhance smart bed use in the future?

It is important to overcome the challenges above to enhance the wide use of smart beds. This can be achieved by fostering collaborative efforts between institutions and countries, increasing funding, standardizing protocols, and providing regulatory support.

Increased funding can support large-scale real-life studies across diverse populations, which is essential to assess the efficacy of new smart bed designs. Since newer smart bed designs use advanced technologies like electronic health records (EHRs) and AI, it is imperative to build public trust regarding data protection measures.

An increase in awareness about the benefits of smart beds can further promote its broader implementation. Greater awareness about smart bed benefits could increase demand, which could boost the overall market size for medical smart beds in the coming years.

Every household seems to have that drawer of miscellaneous belongings. When you need something, you know it’s in there, but it still takes hours to sift through the clutter you should’ve tossed years ago. The massive amount of data being stored in ever-expanding biobanks is a bit like ‘that drawer,’ and it makes finding consistently good quality data increasingly challenging.

Living in the digital age, there’s no shortage of information available, and organizations of all sorts are making it their business to use it. This is especially true now, with advanced technology allowing businesses to analyze vast swathes of data in a way that, up until recently, simply wasn’t possible.

Over the past few decades, healthcare authorities worldwide have established large biobanks, including patient medical records, clinical trial data, and genetic information. While these biobanks hold immense value, the data quality is often inconsistent and comes in a variety of shapes and formats, making it difficult to draw reliable comparisons. Trying to analyze them side by side is like comparing apples to oranges – it just doesn’t work.

This inconsistency is becoming a significant issue. It not only hampers collaboration but also limits the potential of powerful tools like AI and machine learning to deliver meaningful insights. That’s why it’s important to develop a strategy for managing health data globally to streamline the drug development process and, in turn, create more effective outcomes for patients.

The Era of ‘Big Data’ is Now

There’s no denying that data offers immense opportunities to transform a range of industries, especially healthcare. However, if data quality is poor, it can hinder how effectively the data can be used. According to a study by Sun et al. (2022)1, up to 50% of clinical trials fail due to a lack of clinical efficacy. Put simply, if the initial insights aren’t based on strong data-driven evidence, then the treatment is unlikely to be optimally effective.

As advances in technology, such as AI, continue to enhance our ability to extract insights from data, the drive to collect it at an unprecedented pace – and the potential to revolutionize drug development – has never been greater. However, the technology is only as powerful as the data it processes; without high-quality, well-curated data, even the most advanced AI models can falter.

Inconsistent formats, varying degrees of accuracy, and incomplete datasets are common challenges that, without proper attention, can undermine the effectiveness of data-driven insights2. Disparities like these can result in spurious conclusions, ineffective treatments, and missed opportunities to address patients’ unmet needs.

Making Data FAIR

To fully maximize the potential of advanced techniques in healthcare – such as AI, machine learning, and other analytical methods – meticulous data curation and management are essential3. Clean, comprehensive, and well-structured data provides the solid foundation upon which these advanced techniques can build transformative innovations in the healthcare industry.

Adherence to the FAIR data principles—making data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable—is a key component in achieving this. By ensuring data meets these standards, it becomes easier to organize, integrate, and reuse it across various AI-driven applications. Importantly, these principles foster a culture of transparency, innovation, and collaboration, further strengthening the integrity of insights derived from advanced analytical techniques, including AI.

The importance of creating a robust repository of coherent, standardized data extends beyond just this sector. Effective data housekeeping is essential for enabling meaningful collaboration between industry and academia. Cutting-edge research facilities, coupled with the practical clinical development used in industry, leverage the strengths of both sectors. By working together, they can establish standardized data practices, share valuable insights – from pre-clinical research through to development – and construct robust frameworks for data management that align with FAIR principles.

This collaboration ensures that data is not only well-organized and of high quality but also readily accessible and reusable, enhancing its relevance and applicability to real-world challenges.

Data Strategy is Key

Establishing a repository of health data that is accurate, comparable, and reusable is a vital step for maximizing the potential benefits of AI and machine learning in drug development, and reproducibility is crucial to achieving this4. When scientists can revisit previous work and obtain the same results, findings are verified, and trust in the insights drawn from the data is built. Additionally, reproducibility helps minimize errors by revealing inconsistencies in results. Finally, adherence to FAIR data principles facilitates reproducible outcomes, making collaboration across teams and industries smoother and more effective.

By working together, industry and academia can take a unified approach to ensure data is carefully curated, standardized, and relevant. Ultimately, this will drive faster and more effective patient outcomes while guaranteeing that the data remains adaptable and, as far as possible, future-proof. In doing so, we can enable advanced analytical methodologies to reach their full potential and drive progression in healthcare and beyond.

Potential causes

Screening and early detection

Future Directions

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading global health concern, ranking as the third most diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Historically, CRC has been considered an age-related disease, primarily affecting individuals over 50 years. This trend was largely influenced by lifestyle factors and the implementation of widespread screening programs, which contributed to declining incidence rates among older adults in many high-income countries.

However, recent decades have witnessed a concerning shift, with CRC incidence rising among younger adults (under 50 years). This increase is particularly evident in high-income nations like the United States (U.S.), Australia, and parts of Europe, but it is also emerging in Asian and Latin American countries.

The changing epidemiology of CRC highlights the need for further investigation into potential risk factors, including diet, lifestyle, and genetic predisposition. Understanding these evolving patterns is crucial for developing targeted prevention and early detection strategies to address the growing burden of early-onset CRC.1

This article explores the rising incidence of CRC among young adults, investigating possible causes, risk factors, and preventative strategies.

The rising trend

CRC is a growing concern among younger populations in the United States. According to the American Cancer Society, while overall CRC mortality has declined, cases among individuals under 50 have steadily increased.

In 2023, approximately 19,550 people under 50 were diagnosed with CRC, and 3,750 deaths occurred in this age group. The proportion of CRC cases in individuals under 55 has nearly doubled from 11% in 1995 to 20% in 2019.2

More diagnoses at advanced stages accompany this shift. From 2010 onward, regional-stage cases increased by 2%-3% annually in those under 65 and distant-stage cases by 0.5%-3%. The trend reverses previous progress in early-stage detection due to widespread screening. Rectal cancer cases, in particular, have risen, with their share of total CRC diagnoses growing from 27% in 1995 to 31% in 2019.2

Despite overall mortality declining, younger individuals are experiencing an increase in CRC deaths by 0.5%-3% annually. The reasons behind this rise remain uncertain but may include lifestyle changes, diet, obesity, and genetic factors.

Addressing this growing crisis requires improved early detection strategies and equitable access to screening and treatment, particularly for high-risk groups.2

Colorectal Cancer Symptoms

Potential causes

Epidemiological data show that Westernized diets high in red and processed meats and low in fiber- contribute significantly to CRC risk. High consumption of red meat increases gut microbiota-derived metabolites such as trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) and secondary bile acids, which promote inflammation and carcinogenesis. In contrast, fiber-rich diets enhance short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, reducing inflammation and strengthening the gut barrier, thus lowering CRC risk.3,4

The gut microbiome plays a pivotal role in CRC development. Dysbiosis (an imbalance in gut microbial composition) has been linked to CRC. Studies have identified specific microbial strains, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum and Bacteroides fragilis, that promote tumorigenesis by triggering inflammatory pathways and immune evasion. Conversely, beneficial bacteria like Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bifidobacterium help maintain gut homeostasis and may protect against CRC.3,4

Obesity, physical inactivity, smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption are well-established lifestyle risk factors for CRC. Obesity alters gut microbiota composition and increases systemic inflammation, which fosters a pro-carcinogenic environment.

Physical activity, on the other hand, has been shown to modulate the microbiome favorably and reduce CRC risk. Additionally, environmental exposures, such as antibiotic overuse, may disrupt microbial diversity, potentially increasing susceptibility to CRC.3,4

While environmental and lifestyle factors play significant roles, genetic predisposition also influences CRC risk. Individuals with Lynch syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) have a much higher lifetime risk of CRC.

Additionally, genome-wide association studies have identified multiple genetic variants associated with increased susceptibility to CRC, often interacting with dietary and microbial factors.3

Screening and early detection

CRC is increasingly affecting younger individuals, yet they are often diagnosed at later stages, resulting in poorer outcomes. According to the American Cancer Society, CRC incidence in individuals under 55 has been rising by 1%-2% annually since the mid-1990s, with mortality rates growing at a similar pace.

This delay in diagnosis is primarily due to lower screening rates, misattributed symptoms, and a lack of awareness among both patients and healthcare providers.5,6

Several factors contribute to the late-stage diagnosis of CRC in younger individuals. First, CRC screening guidelines have traditionally focused on adults, with routine screenings recommended only after 45.

Consequently, younger individuals experiencing symptoms such as rectal bleeding or abdominal pain may not seek immediate medical attention, and healthcare providers may not prioritize CRC screening for them. Misdiagnoses, often attributing symptoms to less severe conditions like hemorrhoids or irritable bowel syndrome, further delay detection.5,6

Early screening significantly improves survival rates, with stage I CRC having a 91% five-year survival rate compared to only 14% for stage IV cases. Recent advancements in screening tools, including fecal immunochemical tests (FIT), multi-target stool Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) tests, and colonoscopies, enhance early detection. Emerging technologies such as liquid biopsies and artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted diagnostics hold promise for increasing accessibility and accuracy.5,6

Despite the benefits, screening adherence remains low due to financial constraints, fear, and lack of awareness. Expanding screening programs, increasing physician recommendations, and promoting non-invasive tests can improve compliance. Additionally, policy changes that eliminate cost-sharing barriers for preventive screenings can have a significant impact.5,6

Cancer Screening Considerations: Balancing the Benefits and Risks

Future directions

Traditionally considered a disease of older adults, CRC now increasingly affects individuals under 50. Studies suggest genetic predispositions, microbiome alterations, and dietary habits play a role in this trend.

Advances in molecular diagnostics, including liquid biopsy and AI-assisted imaging, are revolutionizing early detection. For instance, blood-based tests analyzing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) are showing promise as non-invasive diagnostic tools. Additionally, AI is improving the accuracy of colonoscopy screenings, reducing false negatives, and enhancing early intervention efforts.7

A multi-pronged approach to prevention is critical in addressing CRC and other chronic diseases. Lifestyle modifications remain the cornerstone of prevention. Research emphasizes the impact of diet, physical activity, and environmental exposures on CRC risk.

High consumption of processed meats, low fiber intake, and sedentary lifestyles significantly contribute to rising cancer cases. Conversely, a diet rich in whole grains, lean proteins, and vegetables, coupled with regular exercise, reduces risk.7

Environmental factors also play a significant role. Increased exposure to microplastics, endocrine disruptors, and processed foods affects gut microbiota composition, leading to chronic inflammation. Public awareness campaigns promoting gut health and microbiome diversity through probiotic and prebiotic-rich diets can mitigate risk.7

Governments and healthcare agencies worldwide are adapting policies to address these rising health concerns. In response to growing CRC incidence in younger adults, screening age recommendations have been lowered from 50 to 45 in several countries.

Implementing universal screening programs with non-invasive options, such as FIT, can improve participation rates. Additionally, policy reforms focus on reducing disparities in healthcare access. Telemedicine and digital health platforms are expanding preventive care outreach, particularly in underserved populations. Governments are also emphasizing regulatory measures on food labeling, restricting carcinogenic additives, and promoting healthier food environments.1,7

The future of disease prevention lies in integrating scientific research with practical public health strategies and evidence-based policies. A combination of technological advancements, lifestyle modifications, and comprehensive policy changes can significantly curb CRC incidence and improve overall health outcomes.

Strengthening early detection methods, fostering preventive healthcare, and ensuring equitable access to medical resources are essential in shaping a healthier future.

AI is revolutionizing all areas of scientific research. How is Molecular Devices utilizing AI to enhance its workflows and support its customers?

At Molecular Devices, we're passionate about equipping researchers with next-generation technology that advances scientific discovery. We recognize that AI is revolutionizing biological research, and we’re creating solutions that allow our customers to leverage the power of AI in their own laboratories.

For high-content imaging specifically, AI helps meet the challenges of complex image analysis. Our IN Carta® Image Analysis Software uses AI to uncover and analyze complex phenotypic data. For example, it features a deep-learning-based segmentation tool that can analyze complex or traditionally hard-to-analyze images, such as those acquired with brightfield imaging.

Users don’t need any coding or scripting experience to get started with our IN Carta analysis software. It’s intuitive and easy to use – almost like a coloring book. You simply mark the objects you’re interested in (a process known as annotation) to train the AI and then test the model. If the model works well, you save and use it in your image analysis protocol. If it doesn’t, you can retrain it by adding more annotated images. It's an iterative process with human supervision.

This software is also integrated into our CellXpress.aiTM Automated Cell Culture System.

The CellXpress.ai system is an enclosed, easy-to-use solution for cell culture that enables our customers to perform simple and complex cell culture protocols without the need for advanced expertise in scripting or automation.

By using AI, the CellXpress.ai system enables users to standardize cell culture processes, replacing previously subjective decisions with objective measurements that determine the next stage of the cell culture process, such as the best time to passage organoids or stem cells. By removing subjective assessments that typically differ between individuals, the CellXpress.ai system improves the reproducibility of cell cultures while still allowing manual input if needed.

With automation comes the need for precision. How is the technology trained to avoid errors?

A key benefit of our technology is that it reduces human errors. The system has safeguards in place; before starting an experiment, the software checks for essentials like sufficient media. If something is missing, the software prompts the user to address any gaps before the experiment runs. The system will also prompt you if it predicts an error will occur as a result of changing elements within the process. The system can also send alerts via email to inform users of potential errors or simply notify them when an automated decision is made. The system provides traceability, allowing users to track down the source of errors, unusual results, or contamination.

Could you give example workflows for the CellXpress.ai Automated Cell Culture System?

Before launch, we developed pre-configured protocols to save customers time on optimization, especially liquid handling.

We validated three main workflows, including one for iPSC culture, which is notoriously high-maintenance and requires daily media changes. The protocols for these workflows are optimized to ensure that critical elements, such as media changes and passaging, occur automatically. By reducing this manual workload, scientists don’t have to come into the lab on weekends to maintain their cell cultures.

Another workflow uses spheroids, where we fine-tuned the media exchange to avoid damaging or losing spheroids. Finally, the third was for intestinal organoids, where we carried out the entire process of 3D cell culture from seeding and feeding to passaging. Using AI and automation here addresses key reproducibility challenges within 3D biology.

What impact do you see the CellXpress.ai Automated Cell Culture System having on researchers?

I think it will change their lives. I’ve spoken to scientists who wished they had access to this system when they were in grad school. They can still complete their work but get their weekends back while focusing more on their science rather than the necessary but mundane manual tasks.

Automation and AI are crucial in early-stage drug discovery. What do you hope your clients can achieve?

I hope they get answers faster.

By catching drug failures early, researchers can save a lot of time and money. Using automation and AI with advanced cellular models helps better predict which compounds will work, so we don't have to rely as much on expensive animal models. This way, fewer drugs fail during clinical testing, making the development process smoother and more efficient.

Study: The Impact of Gut Microbiota on the Development of Anxiety Symptoms—A Narrative Review. Image Credit: Shutterstock AI Generator / Shutterstock.com

In a recent study published in Nutrients, researchers examine the role of the gut microbiome in the development of anxiety disorders.

How does the gut microbiome affect mental health?

Bacteria, viruses, bacteria, fungi, and archaea within the gastrointestinal microbiome interact with each other to support digestion and nutrient absorption, as well as immune function, metabolism, and neurotransmission.

In addition to genetics, environmental factors like age, diet, and geographical location can alter the composition of the gut microbiome. For example, the consumption of fiber-rich and fermented foods can support the proliferation of beneficial bacteria, whereas highly processed diets can lead to gut dysbiosis.

Dysbiosis refers to an imbalance of microorganisms in the gut microbiota, which can lead to a wide range of health problems. Several studies have reported that gut dysbiosis can induce dysfunction in the gut-brain axis, which increase the risk of mental health disorders like anxiety and depression.

Brain function can also be impacted by gut dysbiosis through its effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which subsequently alters the synthesis and secretion of neurotransmitters. The levels of dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and acetylcholine, all of which are neurotransmitters that have been implicated in mental health disorders, can be affected by gut dysbiosis.

Previous studies have reported that the microbiome is less diverse and numerically abundant in patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) as compared to controls. These abnormalities persisted even during remission in one study, thus suggesting the role of the gut dysbiosis the in GAD development.

The presence of certain bacteria species like Eubacterium and Coprococcus, while Blautia and Butyricicoccus may reduce the risk of anxiety. Likewise, probiotic supplementation with Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium may protect against mental illnesses by promoting the growth of beneficial microorganisms.

Simultaneously, probiotics may also suppress the proliferation of pathogenic species such as Eschirichia-Shigella, Fusobacterium, and Ruminococcus gnavus. These pathogenic bacteria can increase gut permeability and systemic inflammation, both of which are implicated in anxiety symptoms.

Mechanisms underlying GAD-gut dysbiosis associations

Beneficial bacteria produce GABA and other metabolites that affect vagal nerve signaling from the gut to the brain. GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that reduces the intensity of anxiety and stress responses. Therefore, low levels of these beneficial bacteria can amplify the intensity and frequency of these responses.

Gut dysbiosis is associated with reduced epithelial integrity, which allows inflammatory molecules to enter the bloodstream. Chronic inflammation has been attributed to increased anxiety and altered brain functioning.

Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyrate, acetate, and propionate exert anti-inflammatory properties within the brain and participate in neurotransmitter activity. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Blautia are SCFA-producing bacteria in the gut microbiome. Thus, gut dysbiosis can interfere with SCFA metabolism to increase the risk of mental health disorders.

The effect of probiotics

Numerous probiotic formulations have been developed and investigated for their potential to alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression with varying levels of success.

Supplementation with Lactobacillus plantarum P8, for example, was found to reduce stress and anxiety symptoms while also reducing inflammatory cytokine levels. Similarly, a probiotic intervention containing Bifidobacterium longum led to reduced perceived stress and improved sleep quality as compared to placebo recipients.

Multi-component probiotic formulations have also been shown to reduce anxiety, depression, and stress levels. For example, one study found that patients who took both 25 mg of sertraline and a probiotic consisting of Bifidobacteirum bifidum, Bifidobacterium lactus, Bifidobacterium longum, and Lactobacillus acidophilus led to a significant reduction in anxiety levels than the placebo group.

The use of these substances and products can be applied both in the prevention and alleviation of existing emotional disorder symptoms by promoting appropriate dietary habits.”

Conclusions

Gut dysbiosis is often observed in patients diagnosed with various forms of anxiety disorders. The presence of gut dysbiosis is related to anxiety disorders, which indicates a possible therapeutic role for probiotics in treating these conditions.

Although probiotics may improve anxiety symptoms, additional studies are needed to validate these findings and determine the appropriate strains, dosage, and duration of therapy for this indication. Future research must also elucidate the pathophysiological pathways through which the gut microbiota affects the brain.",news-medical

In a recent study published in the journal Nature Medicine, researchers in Estonia and Norway identified genetic risk factors associated with female reproductive health conditions through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and assessed their clinical significance.

Background

One in ten women worldwide suffers from a reproductive health disorder, yet many of these conditions remain poorly understood. What if the key to unlocking better treatment lies in our genes? Female reproductive health disorders affect millions, impacting fertility, pregnancy outcomes, and overall well-being.

Conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) are linked to genetic and environmental factors. Despite advancements, many underlying genetic risk factors remain unidentified.

Some genetic variants tied to reproductive conditions are also linked to other health issues, like breast cancer, showing how interconnected these risks can be.

Studies have shown that genetic variations influence susceptibility to these disorders, but existing research has focused primarily on common variants, leaving rare or population-specific variants underexplored. The new study highlights the importance of analyzing genetic data from isolated populations such as Finland and Estonia, where unique population-enriched variants like CHEK2 and MYH11 were identified—variants that are much rarer in other European populations. Moreover, genetic correlations between different reproductive health disorders are not well understood.

Understanding these genetic predispositions can aid in risk assessment, early diagnosis, and personalized treatment strategies.

Given the complexity of these conditions, further research is essential to refine genetic risk prediction models and identify novel therapeutic targets. The ability to predict reproductive health risks through genetics could revolutionize how women manage their health globally.

About the study

Genetic data were analyzed from large biobank cohorts, including the Estonian Biobank (EstBB) and FinnGen, comprising nearly 300,000 women. Diagnosis codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), were used to define cases and controls for 42 female reproductive health phenotypes. Genotyping was performed using high-density genome-wide arrays, followed by imputation with reference panels to increase variant coverage.

GWAS was conducted using an inverse variance-weighted fixed-effects meta-analysis approach. Quality control measures included filtering for call rates, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and imputation quality scores.

Researchers identified 83 genetic loci that had never before been linked to female reproductive health, broadening the understanding of these disorders.

Lead single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified, and genomic risk loci were annotated using the Functional Mapping and Annotation (FUMA) platform.

Genetic correlations were estimated using Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression (LDSC), and polygenicity and discoverability were assessed using MiXeR (polygenicity and discoverability analysis tool) software.

To assess pleiotropy, loci associated with multiple reproductive health conditions were mapped, and candidate genes were prioritized using the Open Targets Genetics portal. Additionally, a polygenic risk score (PRS) for ICP was developed and validated both in the Estonian Biobank and in an independent Norwegian cohort (HUNT study), confirming the robustness of the findings.

Associations between PRS and other phenotypes were explored using a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS). All analyses were adjusted for population stratification and potential confounders.

Study results

A total of 195 genome-wide significant loci were identified across the 42 reproductive health phenotypes. Several previously unidentified and population-enriched variants were detected, highlighting the importance of studying diverse genetic backgrounds.

Among the identified loci, genes involved in hormonal regulation (Follicle-Stimulating Hormone Beta (FSHB), Growth Regulation by Estrogen in Breast Cancer 1 (GREB1)), genital tract development (Wnt Family Member 4 (WNT4), Paired Box Gene 8 (PAX8), Wilms Tumor 1 (WT1)), and folliculogenesis (Checkpoint Kinase 2 (CHEK2)) emerged as key contributors to female reproductive health. Additionally, novel loci such as PDE4D, ID4, and NR0B1 were identified for ovarian cysts, offering new insights into folliculogenesis and potential drug targets.

Many of the genetic risks identified are related to hormone signaling and development of reproductive organs, helping explain why so many conditions affect fertility and pregnancy.

The genetic correlation analysis revealed significant associations between various reproductive disorders. Notably, strong correlations were observed between uterine fibroids and excessive menstruation, as well as between cervical dysplasia and cervicitis. Interestingly, the study also reported a negative genetic correlation between PCOS and preterm delivery, which contradicts epidemiological studies and highlights the need for further investigation.

These findings suggest that overlapping genetic pathways contribute to these conditions. The polygenicity analysis indicated that reproductive health disorders exhibit a high degree of genetic complexity, with many small-effect variants contributing to disease susceptibility. Heritability estimates varied widely across conditions, from 1% to 21%, with higher estimates for metabolic-related disorders such as ICP (12–30%) and PCOS (10–21%).

The PRS for ICP demonstrated a significant association with disease risk. Women in the highest decile of the PRS had a 6.1% prevalence of ICP compared to 0.9% in the lowest decile. The odds ratio for ICP in the highest PRS decile compared to the lowest was 6.7 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.0–9.3, P = 1.9 × 10⁻³³).

The model incorporating PRS improved risk prediction, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.66. Importantly, validation in the HUNT study confirmed the association, with an odds ratio of 1.7 (95% CI: 1.3–2.1, P = 2.8 × 10⁻⁹) per standard deviation increase in PRS, and an AUC of 0.71, underscoring its potential clinical utility.

Beyond ICP, PheWAS identified cholelithiasis as a phenotype significantly associated with the ICP PRS, supporting a shared genetic basis between these conditions. Additionally, pleiotropic loci were identified, with some genes showing associations across multiple phenotypes, reinforcing the genetic interconnectivity of reproductive disorders. For example, WNT4 was associated with uterine fibroids, endometriosis, pelvic organ prolapse, cervical dysplasia, and infertility, demonstrating cross-condition genetic links.

These findings have far-reaching implications. Understanding genetic predispositions can help individuals make informed reproductive health choices, assist clinicians in early diagnosis, and guide public health policies to better address reproductive disorders on a global scale. Personalized risk assessment could transform women’s healthcare by shifting from reactive to proactive interventions. Moreover, the study highlights potential evolutionary trade-offs in the persistence of genetic risk factors, such as the role of PCOS-associated variants in reproductive aging and balancing selection.

Conclusions

To summarize, the findings underscore the polygenic nature of these conditions and highlight shared genetic factors underlying multiple reproductive disorders. The development of PRS for ICP demonstrates the potential for genetic risk prediction in clinical practice, which could inform personalized monitoring and early interventions.

The identification of pleiotropic loci suggests that common genetic pathways contribute to different reproductive health conditions, paving the way for targeted therapeutic strategies. Nonetheless, the study acknowledges limitations such as reliance on ICD-10 codes and the need for further replication in non-European populations.

The integration of genetic data with clinical and environmental factors will be essential for translating these findings into improved healthcare strategies for women worldwide. By leveraging genetic insights, healthcare systems can better allocate resources, design preventive measures, and ultimately improve the quality of life for millions of women globally.",news-medical
https://news-medical.net,Key benefits of outsourcing regulatory submission content development,https://news-medical.net/whitepaper/20250312/Key-benefits-of-outsourcing-regulatory-submission-content-development.aspx,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","In 2023, the FDA rejected a small pharmaceutical company's new drug application (NDA) with a Refusal-to-File (RTF) decision. This letter provided information on a range of issues within the submission, including poorly organized information, incomplete stability data, and inconsistencies in the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) section.

Recognizing that its expertise in this area was limited and that deadlines were looming, the company engaged regulatory affairs consultants to support it in addressing these issues.

The resubmitted dossier earned an approvable letter thanks to its meticulous reorganization, strategic compliance updates, and expanded analyses. In this instance, the company salvaged its product’s market potential by working with consultants.

This example case highlights that the complexities of regulatory submissions require specialized expertise to navigate effectively. By outsourcing submission content development to regulatory affairs consultants, biotech and pharmaceutical companies are able to better reduce risks, streamline processes, and accelerate approval timelines.

This article explores some of the reasons why engaging these experts offers a vital strategic advantage.

Image Credits: Gorodenkoff/Shutterstock

1. Expertise in regulatory nuances

Regulatory requirements differ considerably between agencies. For example, agencies such as the FDA, EMA, and Health Canada each enforce specific guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), data integrity, and pharmacovigilance.

Regulatory affairs consultants have typically spent years working within these frameworks, affording them a wealth of knowledge in this area.

The eCTD (electronic Common Technical Document) format is mandated for global submissions, for example, and a good consultant will ensure that submissions maintain global standards while simultaneously adhering to region-specific nuances.

Consultants’ expertise in this field reduces the likelihood of errors, avoiding the risk of delayed approval or even outright rejections. Their comprehensive understanding of both product development and regulatory strategy helps ensure that drug products adhere to the stringent requirements commonplace in this field.

2. Operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness

Hiring and training an in-house submission preparation team can be time-consuming and expensive, but outsourcing removes these burdens, allowing organizations to focus more on core operations such as clinical development and R&D.

Consultants leverage regulatory intelligence platforms and other advanced tools to streamline the submission process, improving its efficiency. For example, the use of industry-leading regulatory intelligence platforms can lower the time required to create a submission by as much as 50 %.

Consultants who can harmonize multidisciplinary inputs can offer significant benefits to a pharmaceutical company preparing an NDA or Biologics License Application (BLA).

These inputs range from clinical trial data to manufacturing reports, and a consultant able to leverage these inputs to create well-structured, compliant documents will significantly expedite regulatory review cycles.

Their services also ensure consistent and precise submissions that include robust analytical method validations and comprehensive development plans.

3. Global market navigation

Expansion into international markets involves a number of challenges beyond the most obvious issue of language translation. For example, agencies in Tokyo, Singapore, and other regions regularly adopt different interpretations of ICH (International Council for Harmonisation) guidelines.

Regulatory consultants offer indispensable localized expertise, ensuring submissions meet the requirements of each individual market.

For example, the FDA may prioritize post-marketing surveillance protocols while the EMA places more emphasis on environmental risk assessments. Consultants will tailor submissions to address these specific nuances, avoiding potentially expensive mistakes and ensuring that the manufacturing process meets regional regulatory authorities’ expectations.

4. Improved risk management

Regulatory pathways feature an array of potential challenges—from unforeseen compliance issues to constantly shifting guidelines. Consultants will work to proactively identify these challenges and their associated risks, offering mitigation strategies grounded in scientific rationale and precedent.

For example, a company may face scrutiny over missing quality attribute tests in its CMC section. In this instance, consultants could propose scientifically valid alternatives, drawing on historical approvals to justify their approach.

This foresight could potentially streamline the approval process, preventing time-consuming back-and-forth with regulators.

5. Enhanced submission quality

High-quality submission content involves more than just meeting basic compliance requirements—data must be presented in a way that facilitates regulatory decision-making. Regulatory consultants boast considerable expertise in structuring submissions that are compelling as well as complete.

6. Access to thought leadership

Industry-leading consultants are typically at the forefront of regulatory trends, presenting at key events like the Annual DIA Global Meeting. This provides their clients with a considerable competitive edge, allowing them to benefit from the latest compliance technologies and methodologies, for example, AI-driven regulatory intelligence.

AI tools are seeing increasingly widespread use to optimize dossier content and predict regulator queries. These tools can identify common patterns in queries, allowing issues to be addressed pre-emptively and helping to optimize dossier content for closer alignment with regulatory expectations.

Working with consultants who are working with these innovations can considerably improve submission outcomes while also streamlining post-approval requirements.

7. Strategic partnership for long-term success

Outsourcing is more than a transactional relationship; rather, it is a strategic partnership. Consultants support companies in developing internal capabilities via training and knowledge transfer, empowering teams to better navigate future submissions.

It is also important to note that because environmental sustainability is now a central regulatory priority, good consultants can help companies align with emerging green compliance standards, securing approvals while ensuring appropriate corporate responsibility.

Consultants’ involvement in regulatory strategy and the manufacturing process fosters long-term success in terms of meeting regulatory authorities’ expectations.

https://news-medical.net,Key considerations when choosing a CDMO for your project,https://news-medical.net/whitepaper/20250312/Key-considerations-when-choosing-a-CDMO-for-your-project.aspx,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Companies operating in the pharmaceutical and biotech sectors must evaluate a range of critical factors prior to partnering with a contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO).

Selecting and working with the right CDMO can significantly impact drug development projects’ chances of success, so it is essential that companies be well-informed before committing. This article features a comprehensive guide to understanding these key considerations.

Understanding specific needs

Any company looking to work with a CDMO should begin by defining its own product’s development requirements. For example, a company may be in preclinical, clinical, or commercial phase. It may also be prepared to engage an inexpensive CDMO for initial work and accept additional costs and time for tech transfer at a later phase.

Some projects require comprehensive end-to-end services, while others would benefit from support in specific areas, such as formulation or scaling up production.

Many CDMOs specialize in specific stages of development. Clearly identifying a project's stage and the services required allows companies to align their needs with a CDMO that offers complementary expertise.

This is an important consideration because a mismatch between a company’s needs and the CDMO’s capabilities can result in cost overruns, delays, and even regulatory setbacks. Precise alignment ultimately saves both time and money.

Evaluating experience and specialization

Not every CDMO will have equal experience across every dosage form, molecule type, and therapeutic area. It is important to thoroughly explore a potential CDMO’s portfolio and look for case studies or references related to the type of drug to be developed.

If a CDMO has successfully navigated projects involving similar drugs, it is much more likely to be able to effectively manage a project’s unique challenges.

Regulatory experience is also essential. The CDMO should have a track record of working with the EMA, FDA, or other regulatory bodies in a company’s target markets. It is also important that the CDMO is familiar with relevant regulatory frameworks to efficiently navigate compliance.

Scalability of operations

A drug’s production requirements tend to change as it moves through development stages, so it is important that the CDMO is able to scale from clinical trial production to full commercial manufacturing. With this in mind, it is also important to evaluate a CDMO’s capacity to accommodate increased production volumes while maintaining quality standards.

Companies should inquire about a potential CDMO’s manufacturing facilities and equipment, ensuring that it offers the capacity and flexibility to adjust to any potential production increases.

A good CDMO will employ scalable technologies that can help streamline the process, such as leveraging single-use systems in biologics. If a CDMO is unable to scale production in line with its client’s needs, launches could be delayed, and costs could increase, particularly during critical phases like commercial manufacturing.

Companies looking for less expensive options may opt to work with an early-phase CDMO that focuses on early-stage drug development, including preclinical and Phase I/II clinical trials.

Early-phase CDMOs tend to be lower cost because these CDMOs do not require the expensive infrastructure required for large-scale commercial production. Their procedures are also simple, because the testing of safety and efficacy is their primary concern.

Early-phase CDMOs can deliver more rapid timelines that lower overhead, though technology transfer costs are incurred when advancements in the drug necessitate the expertise of a late-phase CDMO.

These additional costs may be worth accepting, however, because late-phase CDMOs can often offer specialist knowledge around topics like mass production and distribution. The technology transfer process can also help companies update their small, experimental batches into consistent production capable of delivering higher volumes.

Regulatory compliance and quality standards

Quality control is non-negotiable in drug manufacturing, so it is important that a CDMO adheres to good manufacturing practices (GMP) and that it successfully passes regular inspections by regulatory agencies like the FDA and EMA.

Companies should investigate a potential CDMO’s compliance history in order to ensure that it meets stringent quality management systems (QMS).

Transparency in quality processes is also key, including how a potential CDMO manages inspections and audits. The CDMO should have a demonstrable history of timely regulatory approvals, and warning letters or compliance issues should be highlighted and thoroughly considered.

Communication and project management

Effective communication is the foundation of a successful partnership. Clear, consistent, and transparent communication is key to managing expectations and timelines while avoiding potential setbacks.

A CDMO should provide a dedicated project manager who will serve as a primary contact throughout the project, ensuring transparency and keeping the company informed of key milestones, updates, and challenges.

A small biotech should expect a CDMO to treat its project with the same care as the projects of big pharma clients in its portfolio.

Location and supply chain capabilities

Geographical proximity has a major impact on logistics and project management, so companies should consider the CDMO’s location in relation to their own operations, particularly if the project in question involves global markets.

A good CDMO should understand specific regional regulations where a product will be marketed and be able to manage cross-border supply chains without delays. A CDMO with robust global capabilities can help streamline issues such as shipping times, customs clearance, and differences in regulatory jurisdictions.

Cost transparency and flexibility

A CDMO’s pricing model should be transparent and clear. Some CDMOs work with opaque pricing structures, charging hidden fees for services like regulatory submissions, quality testing, or material procurement. It is important to request detailed cost breakdowns prior to engaging a CDMO, ensuring that the contract accounts for any potential changes in project scope.

A CDMO should also be flexible enough to manage unforeseen issues without major budget implications. It should also be able to adjust costs if the project needs to pivot or expand.

Innovation and technological capabilities

CDMOs may be able to improve efficiency and lower costs by investing in innovative technologies and leveraging cutting-edge methods and technology. This can offer a range of advantages, but a company should also confirm whether or not these organizations will cover the costs of implementing these technologies or if the client must cover this cost.

A good CDMO will also leverage automation or data-driven analytics to improve manufacturing processes. These technologies can significantly reduce human error, streamline operations, and offer faster turnaround times.

Cultural fit and partnership philosophy

Cultural fit should never be overlooked because a company’s partnership with a CDMO is a long-term engagement that can span years to decades. The CDMO should align with the company’s goals, values, and underlying way of working. A robust cultural fit leads to fewer disruptions and an overall smoother, more productive, long-term relationship.

Conclusion

Working with the right CDMO can essentially make or break a drug development project.

Considering the critical factors outlined here will allow companies to select a partner that meets their technical and regulatory requirements while aligning with their long-term goals.

DS Inpharmatics’ wide-ranging and comprehensive experience in guiding clients through these complex decisions ensures successful partnerships with CDMOs, streamlining the path to regulatory approval and commercial success.

Consultants can help to bring new therapies to market faster by harmonizing Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) guidelines, leveraging FDA expedited pathways, and developing strategic partnerships.

Harmonizing CMC guidelines

Global harmonization of CMC guidelines is a key focus for top pharmaceutical consultants. Variations in regulatory requirements across regions often create inefficiencies in drug development—for example, differences in manufacturing standards and stability testing protocols can lead to delays and redundant processes.

Aligning with global CMC standards can help to minimize these inefficiencies, allowing pharmaceutical companies to expedite the approval process, reduce developmental costs, and achieve quicker market entry​.

Leveraging FDA Fast Track and Accelerated Approval pathways

Consultants can reduce drug development timelines by leveraging expedited pathways such as the FDA Fast Track and Accelerated Approval.

These pathways afford drug developers more frequent interactions with the FDA, with the potential for early and rolling reviews. Most notably, Fast Track designation allows for continuous communication, which is vital for proactively identifying and addressing critical gaps in data.

Drugs approved via these pathways may also qualify for Priority Review, enabling faster market access by considerably streamlining the regulatory process.

Strategic partnerships and early CMC planning

Engagement with Contract Manufacturing Organizations (CMOs) and the development of strategic partnerships is another key way that consultants improve the efficiency of drug development.

These partnerships provide essential resources and expertise that are frequently unavailable in-house. The early planning and meticulous documentation of CMC activities is essential if regulatory expectations are to be met and the approval process is to proceed smoothly.

This approach enables effective risk management and resource allocation throughout the entire development lifecycle, ensuring that potential challenges or barriers are anticipated and addressed before these become critical issues​.

Expedited development support

Effectively navigating expedited development processes necessitates continuous and open lines of communication with the FDA and other regulatory bodies. Consultants are often central to accommodating these compressed timelines, supporting pharmaceutical companies to develop strategic plans that maintain consistency in manufacturing processes and data quality despite time pressures.

Consultants also enable negotiations with regulatory agencies, upholding scientific rigor while accommodating expedited timelines. Adopting a proactive approach ensures that drug development processes can be expedited without compromising on quality​.

Benefits of drug development consulting services

Strategic expertise and the ability to navigate complex regulatory landscapes are crucial for pharmaceutical companies aiming to accelerate drug development.

https://news-medical.net,"Developing heart cells use ""speed dating"" to find the right match",https://news-medical.net/news/20250312/Developing-heart-cells-use-speed-dating-to-find-the-right-match.aspx,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","In developing hearts, cells shuffle around, bumping into each other to find their place, and the stakes are high: pairing with the wrong cell could mean the difference between a beating heart and one that falters. A study publishing on March 12 in the Cell Press journal Biophysical Journal demonstrates how heart cells go about this ""matchmaking"" process. The researchers model the intricate movements of these cells and predict how genetic variations could disrupt the heart development process in fruit flies.

In both humans and fruit flies, the heart's tissues arise from two distinct regions of the embryo, which are initially far apart. As development progresses, these cells journey toward each other, ultimately merging into a tube-like shape that will become the heart. For the heart to develop correctly, these cells must align and pair up precisely.

""As the cells come together, they jiggle and adjust, and somehow always end up pairing with a heart cell of the same type,"" says the lead author, Timothy Saunders (@TimESaunders) of the University of Warwick. This observation inspired the team to explore how cells match up in the first place and how they know when they've found the right fit.

Developing heart cells have tentacle-like protrusions called filopodia, which probe and grab onto potential partners. Saunders' previous work found that proteins create waves that pull mismatched cells apart, giving them another chance to find the right match.

It's basically like cells are speed dating. They have just a few moments to determine if they're a good match, with molecular 'friends' ready to pull them apart if they're not compatible."" Timothy Saunders, lead author

The researchers found that heart cells seek stability where they remain closest to stillness-like a rolling ball that eventually comes to a stop, known as energy equilibrium in physics. In developing heart cells, this principle applies when cells find a balance between connection forces and their ability to adjust to strain-also known as adhesive energy and elasticity. Based on this observation, the team developed a model that shows how cells can self-organize.

Next, the team tested their model on fruit fly hearts with mutations and misalignments. By calculating the adhesive energy between different cell types and assessing tissue elasticity, the model predicted how cells would match and rearrange.

""Although rare, sometimes the heart tube ends up with one cell on one side when it should have two, or two cells when there should be four,"" says Saunders. ""We could input these imperfections into the model and run it."" The model produced outcomes that closely mirrored what was observed in real embryos.

The team notes that their model not only enhances our understanding of how cells match and align during heart development but also has broader applications. Similar cell-matching processes are crucial in neuronal connections, wound repair, and facial development, where hiccups can lead to conditions like cleft lip.

""Essentially, we're putting numbers to biological processes to explain what we observe,"" Saunders adds.

Researchers from multiple institutions, led by first author and corresponding author Deidra R. Fricke from the University of Pittsburgh, studied the genetic and lifestyle factors that influence peripheral artery disease (PAD), a condition that restricts blood flow to the legs. Their findings suggest that people from families with exceptional longevity have a lower risk of PAD, possibly due to inherited genetic traits or healthier lifestyle habits.

Peripheral artery disease is a common but often undiagnosed condition that affects millions worldwide. It increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, and mobility issues. This study conducted using data from the Long Life Family Study (LLFS), found that individuals from long-lived families have significantly better vascular health than the general population.

""Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a major contributor to morbidity in older adults.""

The researchers analyzed over 3,000 participants, including 1,090 long-lived individuals, their 1,554 children, and 362 spouses. Among the oldest participants (average age 89), about 18% had PAD. However, among their children (average age 60), only 1% had PAD-far lower than the expected 12% found in other studies. This finding suggests that certain protective factors, whether genetic or lifestyle-related, help maintain healthier arteries in these families.



In the study, key risk factors for PAD were identified, including aging, high blood pressure, smoking, and hypertension medication use. Interestingly, unlike in other studies, high cholesterol and diabetes were not major risk factors in this group. This data further supports the idea that long-lived families may have genetic protective factors that contribute to better vascular health.



In addition to lifestyle factors, the study found four genomic regions linked to PAD risk. Three of these were new discoveries, while the fourth was similar but not identical to previously published findings. These genetic markers may help scientists better understand why some individuals are more likely to develop PAD and how to prevent it.

""We identified four genomic sites that may harbor variants associated with protection from PAD.""

This research highlights the value of studying long-lived families to unlock the secrets of healthy aging and vascular health. Understanding what helps them maintain better artery function could lead to new strategies for preventing PAD, heart disease, and other age-related conditions.",news-medical

The FDA granted priority review, with a decision expected by June 19, 2025. LEN represents a novel class of HIV therapies by targeting the viral capsid, a multifunctional protein essential for HIV replication. Unlike traditional antiretrovirals that target enzymes such as reverse transcriptase or protease, LEN binds directly to the capsid protein, disrupting several critical steps in the virus’s life cycle.

At Sino Biological, we are proud to support this era of progress with our industry-leading recombinant HIV antigen[ products. As the fight against HIV evolves, our high-quality antigens empower researchers, vaccine developers, and diagnostic innovators to stay ahead of the curve.

Mechanism of action

LEN is a first-in-class, long-acting HIV-1 capsid inhibitor that disrupts multiple stages of the viral replication cycle. By binding to the capsid protein, it blocks the nuclear import of HIV-1 proviral DNA, preventing its integration into the host genome. Additionally, it disrupts capsid core formation, resulting in structurally defective virions, and interferes with Gag/Gag-Pol function, reducing proper virus assembly and release. This multistage inhibition gives LEN potent antiviral activity, even against drug-resistant HIV-1 strains. Administered subcutaneously every six months after an oral lead-in phase, its extended half-life (8–12 weeks) ensures sustained viral suppression, offering a promising option for individuals with multidrug-resistant HIV or those seeking alternatives to daily therapy (Figure 1).

Research application

Sino Biological products are frequently cited in well-reputed journals. For instance, Yang, C., Liu, D., and colleagues used recombinant HIV capsid protein p24 (Sino Biological ) and an HIV-1 p24 ELISA Pair Set to develop a gold nanorod (AuNR)-based microfluidic-integrated multicolor immunosensor for HIV-1 p24 detection with patients’ serum samples. Their study demonstrated that increased levels of HIV-1 p24 are detectable within 1-2 weeks after infection (Figure 2) 1.

In another study, McKendry, R., and collaborators developed novel nanobodies to detect HIV-1 p24. They assessed these nanobodies' ability to detect multiple p24 subtypes using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with purified recombinant HIV-1 p24 proteins, including Group M subtype D, as well as Groups N and O (Sino Biological) (Figure 3) 2.

Additionally, Li, L., and coworkers discovered that a glycosylated dihydrochalcone, trilobatin, inhibits HIV-1 entry by blocking the gp41 pocket-forming site. They further evaluated the possible mechanisms of action in gp120-mediated HIV-1 entry and found that trilobatin did not bind to the gp120 envelope. In contrast, the positive control, HP-OVA, bound to HIV gp120 (Sino Biological) in an ELISA assay (Figure 4)3.
