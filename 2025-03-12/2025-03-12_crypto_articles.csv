Amid the price rise, cumulative open interest in perpetual futures listed across major exchanges has stabilized near 1.35 billion XRP, with annualized funding rates and cumulative volume delta printing negative, according to data source Velo.

Negative funding rates mean shorts are paying fees to counterparties to keep their bearish bets open. It shows the dominance of bearish short positions in the market. The negative cumulative volume delta, which measures the net capital inflows into the market, indicates that selling volume has accumulated more than buying volume, potentially signaling a bearish trend.

Both indicators, therefore, cast doubt on whether XRP's price rise has legs. At press time, several other large-cap tokens like DOGE, SOL, SUI, HBAR, LTC, BTC, TRX and HYPE had negative CVDs on a 24-hour basis.

Speaking of DOGE, the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of the token's price is about to cross below the 200-day SMA, confirming the so-called death cross. The ominous-sounding pattern indicates that the short-term price momentum is now underperforming the long-term momentum, with the potential to evolve into a major bearish trend.

These SMA crossovers are widely followed by trend traders, meaning the confirmation of the death cross could bring more selling pressure to the market. That said, long-term SMA crossovers are lagging indicators, reflecting the sell-off that has already materialized and have a mixed record of predicting price moves in the BTC and ETH markets.

Note that, DOGE has already dropped 65% since peaking at over 48 cents in December.

BTC most dominant in four years

Bitcoin's dominance rate, or the cryptocurrency's share in the total market capitalization, has increased to 62.5%, the highest since March 2021, according to data source TradingView.

The indicator in consideration is the spread between ""continuous"" next month and front-month standard BTC futures trading on the global derivatives giant. A continuous contract is a calculated representation of a series of successively expiring futures contracts, allowing for a continuous historical data series for analysis.

The spread has narrowed to $495, the lowest since Nov. 5, having peaked at $1,705 on Dec. 17, according to data source TradingView. In other words, it has completely reversed the Trump bump in a sign of weakening bullish sentiment in the market.

""The narrowing spread between front-month and next-month CME Bitcoin futures could suggest traders are tempering their price expectations,"" Thomas Erdösi, head of product at CF Benchmarks, told CoinDesk.

The unwinding of the Trump bump likely means the market has moved past the narrative that a pro-crypto President in the White House is good for the industry, and macro correlations are back in the driver's seat.

""What we can see is that the front contract basis has repriced lower substantially since the beginning of March, signalling moderating near term expectations that the primary catalyst for the recent rally—the election of President Trump—has been fully priced in,"" Erdosi said.

That's already happening. Both BTC and Wall Street's tech-heavy index, Nasdaq, have dropped 20% and 8%, respectively, since early February on a myriad of factors, including geopolitical uncertainty, Trump tariffs and the outlook for inflation and economic growth.

Additionally, the bitcoin market had to digest disappointment over the lack of fresh purchases in Trump's strategic digital asset reserve plan. Last week, Trump signed an executive order, directing a creation of a strategic reserve that includes BTC seized in enforcement actions.

""The announcement about the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is not what the market was hoping for. Many expected the Reserve to buy new Bitcoin, but instead, they stated they would not sell any of their existing Bitcoin or confiscated Bitcoin. While this is a positive move, it caused a sharp decline in Bitcoin's price,"" Ian Balina, founder and CEO of Token Metrics, told CoinDesk in an email.

Futures are still in contango

While the spread between next month and front month CME futures contracts has narrowed, the entire curve remains in contango, where far-dated futures contracts (with longer maturities) trade at a premium to near-dated.

That's how it usually is in all markets due to factors like storage, financing, insurance costs, and expectations of rising prices over coming weeks or months.

""The fact that perpetual funding rates remain positive and the futures basis is still in contango suggests the recent move is driven by unlevered spot longs being squeezed, rather than broader market contagion,"" Erdösi noted.",coindesk

The wallet then started withdrawing funds, reducing the margin below maintenance requirements in a move that resulted in a $1.8 million profit for the user but a $4 million loss for Hyperliquid’s Hyperliquid Provider (HLP) vault.

Vaults are a blockchain-based product on Hyperliquid where users can deposit USDC to potentially earn a share of profits generated by trading strategies of other users or the vault’s owner.

The moves created speculation among Hyperliquid users of a possible exploit of the platform, a rumor it doused in an X post.

“There was no protocol exploit or hack,” Hyperliquid said. “This user had unrealized PNL, withdrew, which lowered their margin, and was liquidated. They ended with ~$1.8M in PNL. HLP lost ~$4M over the past 24h. HLP's all-time PNL remains at ~$60M. As a reminder, HLP is not a risk-free strategy.”

Hyperliquid added that it will update the maximum leverage for bitcoin (BTC) and ETH to 40x and 25x, respectively, to increase maintenance margin requirements for larger positions as a preventive measure for similar moves in the future.

Hyperliquid’s HLP vault still has an all-time profit of $60 million, data shows. Meanwhile, the platform’s HYPE token dropped from $14 to under $13 in a knee-jerk move after the liquidation, though it has since fully recovered the brief slide as of late Asian hours.",coindesk

In March 2021, four years prior, bitcoin was trading around $60,000, near the peak of the previous market cycle. The decline in CAGR is expected as bitcoin's volatility and returns diminish over time as the asset matures.

The ether (ETH)-to-bitcoin (ETH/BTC) ratio has also entered negative CAGR territory at 6%, reflecting the underperformance of ethereum's native token compared to bitcoin. This decline is primarily due to ether price remaining essentially flat since February 2021, which is now below $2,000.

This isn’t a utopian vision, it’s the necessary evolution of social media in an era where digital sovereignty is a fundamental right.

For decades, we have unknowingly traded our digital independence for the convenience of centralized platforms. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, these platforms have shaped our digital lives, yet they function more like gilded cages. Every post we create, every relationship we cultivate, every conversation we engage in is ultimately controlled by corporations that can modify, monetize, or erase our digital existence with a single policy change or algorithmic decision.

A New Future for TikTok

As TikTok decides on its ownership future, Project Liberty has teamed up with Alexis Ohanian, the co-founder of Reddit and a pioneer in online community building, and Kevin O'Leary, renowned investor and entrepreneur known for his role on Shark Tank, to take the platform on-chain. Why?

At its core, this is about more than just TikTok. It’s about who controls the digital spaces where billions connect, create, and consume information. For too long, the internet’s most vibrant communities have been shaped –and ultimately governed– by a handful of corporations. Project Liberty is leading the movement to change that, ensuring that social networks serve the people who power them, not just those who own them.

The key to this shift is Frequency, a public, permissionless blockchain developed by Project Liberty’s technology team and designed specifically for high-volume social networking, reinforces the foundation of a user-driven internet, prioritizing interoperability, data sovereignty, and resilience against centralized control. Together, these initiatives aim to move social media away from corporate ownership and toward an open, user-controlled model.

TikTok, for all its cultural impact, is no different. As the debate over its ownership and data practices continues, the larger issue remains unresolved: should a single entity, whether a government or a corporation, control the social fabric of a generation? What’s at stake isn’t just who owns TikTok but whether a platform of its scale can operate outside the confines of centralized control. If it is to be reimagined within a decentralized framework, it will require a foundation built on true interoperability, user-owned data, and open governance. This is where Frequency comes in.

From TikTok to Bluesky: Building a Decentralized Future

The question of TikTok’s future highlights a much larger shift in how we think about social media. The need for decentralization is no longer theoretical, it’s an urgent necessity. Bluesky, an open-source social media project, is one attempt to answer that call.

Bluesky is not just another platform, it represents an effort to redefine the relationship between users and their digital identities. But true digital liberation demands more than good intentions, it requires a structural commitment to full decentralization. It offers a glimpse into what a decentralized social web could look like, but key vulnerabilities remain.

Bluesky, for all its promise, still relies on structural choke points that pose a risk to its long-term decentralization. Storage nodes largely remain centralized under the control of Bluesky PBC or 3rd party providers, meaning user data is still housed in locations that could become points of control. Relay and Firehose systems, responsible for data distribution, remain concentrated in the hands of a few. And while it is positive that Bluesky has implemented the W3C standard for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), the PLC (Public Ledger of Credentials) directory is also centralized. These may seem like small technical details at present, but history has repeatedly shown how seemingly minor technical decisions can become the very mechanisms through which power is consolidated and autonomy is eroded.

Frequency, the Backbone of a Decentralized Social Web

This is where Frequency enters the picture, not just as a blockchain, but as an entirely new framework for digital identity and social media governance. Frequency isn’t merely modifying the current model; it is rethinking how we interact online from the ground up. Instead of central authorities dictating terms, Frequency ensures that users — not platforms — hold the keys to their digital lives.

Decentralization is more than a technical shift, it’s about restoring fundamental rights. Users must have the ability to grant access to their data, but just as crucially, they must have the power to revoke it. The relationships they build online — followers, connections, conversations — must belong to them, not to a platform that can manipulate or erase them at will.

Decentralization With Purpose

Frequency operates on the principle of minimal, purposeful decentralization which makes long term sustainability of the ecosystem at population scale viable. The only data stored on-chain is what is essential to guarantee individual data rights. This design approach allows for efficient chain optimization focused on core social events, primarily activity related to account, graph, and communication primitives.This focus on core social allows for tokenized incentives to be designed around management of network capacity, with specific incentives for creators, consumers and other more specific actors left to higher levels of the technology stack.

The promise of a user-owned internet is incomplete without robust safeguards that protect personal data. Frequency ensures that users have cryptographic protection over their information, along with granular controls that dictate how their data is shared. At the same time, they should have the flexibility to impose platform-specific restrictions, ensuring that their content appears only in the digital spaces where they want it to be seen. Further, they must be able to delete their content at their discretion. They should also have the power to restrict content to specific platforms if they choose to do so.

This approach directly addresses the fundamental roadblocks that have prevented previous attempts at decentralization from scaling. Frequency ensures that no single entity — not even its own node operators—has the power to alter or censor user data. It provides a decentralized backup of Bluesky’s Firehose, ensuring that user-generated content remains accessible beyond the control of a single party. Its architecture is designed not just for ideological purity but for practical sustainability and scalability, offering minimal latency and cost-efficient operations to ensure the system remains viable for mass adoption.

Achieving Digital Self-Sovereignty

The internet was meant to be open, interconnected, and free. But today, we stand at a crossroads: either we continue to rely on corporate-controlled social media, or we take the necessary steps to create a more open, user-owned digital future.

Bluesky is a step forward, but without addressing its remaining points of centralization, it risks becoming just another walled garden, perhaps a slightly more open one, but still one where users lack true control. TikTok presents an even bigger challenge. The debate over its ownership is missing the point. The real question isn’t who should own TikTok, but whether any social media giant should be owned at all in the traditional sense. Decentralization offers a new way forward, one where platforms are built around user sovereignty, rather than corporate control.

With Frequency, we are moving one step closer to reclaiming the original promise of the internet. True digital liberation requires breaking free from the data monopolies that have defined the social media era. This isn’t just a technological upgrade, it’s a necessary shift in power.",coindesk
https://coindesk.com,The SEC's Retreat From Crypto Enforcement May Invite More Private Lawsuits,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2025/03/12/the-sec-s-retreat-from-crypto-enforcement-may-invite-more-private-lawsuits,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Until the new presidential administration took office, the digital asset industry was embroiled in an existential showdown with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. For years, the SEC waged a scorched-earth regulation-by-enforcement campaign against the digital asset industry and its most-used platforms for failing to adhere to confusing — or non-existent — rules about what constitutes a security and who must register to buy and sell them. Now, under new leadership, the SEC has confirmed the end of its regulation-by-enforcement era.

While this shift has dramatically reduced (though not eliminated) exposure to regulatory suits by the agency, the industry must prepare for private plaintiffs to exploit the enforcement void and perpetuate, at least in the near term, ambiguities in the application of federal securities laws by bringing suits in U.S. courts alleging that particular digital assets are securities and seeking to hold businesses and their leaders responsible for withholding material information or other alleged misconduct, in violation of the securities laws.

The SEC’s Enforcement U-Turn

Under its new leadership, the SEC has confirmed the end of the regulation-by-enforcement era and taken significant steps to progress its policy goals, including a focus on prosecuting bad actors and fraud in the digital asset space. The most significant regulatory shifts include:

Crypto Task Force: Just one day into his tenure as SEC Acting Chair, Commissioner Uyeda announced the formation of a “Crypto Task Force” and, in doing so, publicly recognized what so many had long been saying: the SEC’s refusal to promulgate rules and instead regulate by enforcement sowed “confusion about what is legal” including “who must register” to trade digital assets and, importantly, how to register. The Crypto Task Force’s stated mission is to provide clarity to these questions and develop a regulatory framework for digital assets. It is hosting a series of industry roundtables, with the first to focus on how to define which digital assets are securities. .

Enforcement Action Dismissals: The SEC has dismissed (or agreed in principle to dismiss) nearly all non-fraud cases concerning allegations that a defendant failed to register as an exchange or broker-dealer.

Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit: The SEC replaced the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit with the Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit (“CETU”), which is focused on protecting “retail investors from bad actors.” The SEC announced that CETU and its 30 fraud specialists and attorneys (down from more than 50) would focus on “[f]raud involving blockchain technology and crypto assets” among other priorities.

These changes indicate that SEC enforcement in the digital asset space will undoubtedly decline, given that the agency will no longer use its enforcement arm as the primary means to create regulatory policy and its associated reduction in staff focused on blockchain and crypto matters. According to the SEC, its staff remains committed to prosecuting bad actors and fraud-based claims, with Commissioner Hester Peirce clarifying that the shift in priorities and resources is not an end to SEC enforcement and that “statutes already on the books do not allow a free-for-all.”

Unsettled Law is an Opportunity for Litigation

In the face of the SEC’s enforcement retreat, individuals and firms should be prepared for private plaintiffs to exploit the enforcement void. Historically, the private plaintiffs’ bar has stepped in to pursue litigation in the wake of decreased regulatory enforcement (or at least the perception of it), whether it be suits alleging violation of the federal antitrust laws or financial misconduct in violation of the securities laws following the 2008 crisis. Such private suits, often brought as class actions, can be an expensive nuisance for businesses and their founders (often named as defendants themselves) — even for those who prevail at an early stage.

In the digital asset space, private plaintiffs may still use the federal securities laws as a basis to bring a variety of allegations, including:

selling unregistered securities;

engaging in the sale of securities by means of a prospectus (e.g. white paper) containing untrue statements or omissions of material facts;

securities fraud and other misconduct (e.g. rug pulls or pump-and-dump schemes);

violations by individuals who have decision-making control over the seller, such as founders or company leadership

Private plaintiffs may also pursue alleged violations of state securities laws and other common law causes of action.

Although the SEC’s new interpretation of the securities laws is more aligned with industry thinking, it does not bind courts analyzing the question of whether a digital asset is a security. For instance, private plaintiffs pursued the TRON Foundation and its founders, alleging that they misled investors by promoting, offering, and selling TRX — an alleged security — in violation of the federal and state securities laws. Late last year, the U.S. District Court for Southern District of New York denied in part the defendants’ motion to dismiss, and in doing so, explained that the SEC's previous framework for determining whether crypto assets were securities was a “nonbinding interpretation of a legal standard.”

And while decisions from appellate courts are binding on the courts below them, the SEC recently dismissed a suit (involving Coinbase) that was pending appellate review on the issue of whether crypto asset transactions qualify as securities. Another similar suit is rumored to be dismissed soon. This means, for now, that lower courts will continue to lack guidance from a higher court on that issue, leaving private plaintiffs free to argue that the federal securities laws apply.

As a result, companies should expect an increase in private litigation. One area to watch is meme coins. While there are persuasive arguments for why meme coins should not be considered securities, private plaintiffs are sure to argue that the circumstances of a particular meme coin bring it within the ambit of the federal securities laws.

This year has been mostly positive for the digital asset industry. It has escaped the grip of an agency that was seemingly determined to crush it. But businesses and their founders re-evaluating their legal risk should confer with their legal teams on whether they may be targets of increased private litigation, so they can create strategies to mitigate such exposure.

“We are entering an unprecedented period of growth for the crypto industry, driven by greater regulatory clarity around the world and increasing institutional adoption,” said Brad Garlinghouse, chief executive officer of Ripple, in a release.

“Thanks to its early leadership in creating a supportive environment for tech and crypto innovation, the UAE is exceptionally well-placed to benefit.”

Ripple said it has seen increasing demand across the Middle East from crypto-native firms and traditional financial institutions, and has around 20% of its global customer base already operating in the Middle East.

Payments utility is also expected to drive greater stablecoin adoption in the UAE, with stablecoins offering real time settlements. That can drive further growth for Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin — which stands at a $134 million capitalization as of Thursday (meaning an equivalent amount in USD backing).

Ripple’s DFSA license adds to its growing list of over 60 regulatory approvals worldwide, including a Major Payments Institution license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), a New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) Trust Charter, a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) registration from the Central Bank of Ireland, and Money Transmitter Licenses (MTLs) across multiple U.S. states.

Ardoino stood out from the crowd, not for his wealth but for his choice of attire. While others dressed to impress, he opted for a laid-back look — a light blue Ralph Lauren polo and gray khakis — despite likely having the deepest pockets in the room.

“This is my first trip to America,” he started off saying. “It’s beautiful. I feel very welcomed.”

Ardoino indeed avoided the country for a long time. The Italy-born computer scientist until recently mainly focused Tether’s operations on developing regions, with financial freedom as the stated goal.

Another reason could be that Tether has been under scrutiny from industry leaders as well as U.S. authorities for some time, including the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYFSD).

That's changed. Ardoino has been on a tour of the U.S. over the past week, posting photos of himself on the U.S. Capitol Building steps in Washington D.C. on Thursday and participating in a fireside chat with Strike CEO Jack Mallers at a Tuesday event organized by the Bitcoin Policy Institute.

The company, which according to Ardoino is run by only 150 employees across 50 countries, settled charges with the CFTC and an NYDFS inquiry in 2021. There have been numerous reports of an ongoing Department of Justice investigation into the stablecoin issuer as well over the past few years.

“We’ve been through hell,” Ardoino told attendees at the conference. “People were saying that if I came to the U.S. I’d be arrested ... They will try to scare you off.""

""We’re still here, right?”

After a rundown of Tether’s previous success in the stablecoin business — the company reportedly made a $13 billion profit in 2024 and its stablecoin, USDT, holds over 60% of market share among stablecoins — Ardoino went on to present current projects that the company is working on, including its efforts in education, AI and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization.

“The outlook for this year is wonderful as well,” Ardoino said.

Ardoino's U.S. journey came at a time when the U.S. legislature is moving forward to regulate the $200 billion and rapidly growing stablecoin market. Tether is dominating the asset class with its $143 billion USDT cryptocurrency, followed by U.S.-based competitor Circle with its $58 billion USDC token.

While Tether is an offshore company — it recently announced its intention to establish its headquarters in El Salvador — and has yet to show interest in formally entering the U.S. crypto market, its ties to the U.S. are multifaceted.

The firm is one of the biggest buyers of U.S. debt, holding nearly $100 billion worth of U.S. Treasuries and government-backed securities as a reserve asset for its USDT token. If it were a country, it would be among the top 20 U.S. debt holders. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said during a White House digital asset summit on Friday that stablecoins are key to preserving the U.S. dollar as the dominant reserve currency in the world, a line of argument that Ardoino touted multiple occasions before.

The company also gained a powerful ally in the Trump administration in Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, former CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, the Wall Street investment firm that manages Tether's U.S. Treasury holdings. The Wall Street Journal reported that Cantor is also invested in Tether's holding company, while Lutnick said during his confirmation hearing that Cantor holds Tether convertible bonds but has no equity stake.

Ardoino, in an interview with CoinDesk last year, said that the firm also onboarded U.S. agencies such as the FBI and Secret Service to its platform in an effort to combat illicit activities.

On the investment front, Tether became a major shareholder with a $775 million investment in U.S.-listed video sharing platform Rumble, popular among U.S. conservative and right-wing users. With Tether's backing, Rumble CEO Chris Pavloski laid out plans to introduce a crypto wallet and support payments with USDT, BTC and Tether's gold-backed token XAUT.

Pavloski repeatedly called Ardoino while he was on stage Wednesday.",coindesk

""Our collaboration with CoinFund on CESR delivers a critical benchmark for Ethereum staking, offering institutions a trusted and standardized rate,"" said Alan Campbell, president at CoinDesk Indices.

Dan Husher, chief data product officer at Lukka, added that the deal illustrates a ""higher standard for institutional crypto data.""

Ethereum staking has ballooned since the blockchain transitioned from a proof-of-work to proof-of-stake consensus mechanism in September 2022. There is currently $37 billion in total value locked (TVL) across liquid staking protocols, which let users earn additional yield through the issuance of liquid staking tokens (LSTs).

""Ethereum’s change to proof of stake transformed blockchain security from a commitment of computing power to a financial commitment,"" said Andy Baehr, CFA, head of product and research atCoinDesk Indices.

ETHEREUM HOLESKY TESTNET FINALIZES - FINALLY: Ethereum's Holesky testnet achieved finality nearly two weeks after the Pectra upgrade, overcoming a client-software configuration bug that had prevented finality since Feb. 24. The achievement comes as Ethereum developers held off on deciding when Pectra would go live on the mainnet blockchain, thus delaying the big upgrade. — Shaurya Malwa Read more.

STARKNET TO SETTLE ON BITCOIN AND ETHEREUM: One of the foremost projects aiming to increase the speed of the Ethereum network is ramping up its work on the world's original blockchain: Bitcoin. Ethereum layer-2 Starknet, in partnership with BTC wallet Xverse, is aiming to deliver a ""full DeFi experience to Bitcoin users."" Xverse said it will ""achieve Bitcoin's DeFi take-off moment,"" through integrating with Starknet in Q2 2025, in an emailed announcement seen by CoinDesk. The Starknet Foundation has published a new Bitcoin Roadmap, which described how Starknet would remain fully active on Ethereum, while ""becoming Bitcoin's execution layer,"" with the goal of scaling the network ""from 13 TPS to thousands."" Developers have been increasingly exploring how to tap the security and deep reserves held in BTC to empower the broader DeFi and blockchain world. The challenge has been how to address Bitcoin's relative lack of programmability compared to Ethereum and others. - Jamie Crawley Read more.

FROM ETHEREUM’S ENGINE ROOM TO WALL STREET: DANNY RYAN’S NEW MISSION: Danny Ryan, previously a key researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, left the EF in September but entered talks a few months later to rejoin the organization as its new leader. In January, Ryan ""ended up mutually parting ways"" with the foundation, and in March he announced he would be joining Etherealize, an organization focused on bringing Ethereum to Wall Street. In a candid interview with CoinDesk, Ryan said he made the move because he believes Ethereum is at a technological inflection point: ""Ethereum is much bigger than the EF. It's not just a couple of changes at the EF that are going to make or break Ethereum at large."" — Margaux Nijkerk Read more.

JAPANESE TECH GIANTS SONY AND LINE JOIN FORCES: Sony's blockchain division is bringing Japanese social media giant LINE into the Web3 world, with plans to adapt several popular mini-apps onto Sony's Soeneium network, the company announced. LINE reports approximately 200 million active users across its platform, and the agreement will bring four LINE-based games, or ""mini-apps,"" to Soneium: Sleepagotchi, Farm Frens, Puffy Match, and Pocket Mob. The integration is meant to facilitate features like in-game rewards and purchases. Soneium went live in January, and at the time, the team said that they hoped to bridge Web2 users into the Web3 space.

Hemi, founded by early Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik, plans to unify Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two oldest and largest blockchains, into ""a single supernetwork,"" according to an emailed announcement.

Hemi is built on both Bitcoin and Ethereum to combine the best qualities of both, taking advantage of Bitcoin's security and Ethereum's programmability. The project raised $15 million in a funding round led by Binance Labs last September.

The project is one of several looking to transform the broader blockchain landscape, particularly with regard to decentralized finance (DeFi), through combining Bitcoin and Ethereum due in part to the deep stores of value held in bitcoin (BTC), which comfortably exceed those of every other digital asset combined.

However, Bitcoin's coding lacks the ability to natively build some of the functions that DeFi requires, such as smart contracts or zero-knowledge proofs, hence the need to bridge this utility from Ethereum.

The company has signed up dozens of protocols for deployment on Hemi, including decentralized exchange (DEX) Sushi, liquid staking token pumpBTC and oracles RedStone and Pyth.",coindesk

Danny Ryan—a key visionary behind Ethereum's most ambitious upgrade, ""The Merge""—left the EF in September but entered talks a few months later to rejoin the organization as its new leader.

""I was in conversation with Vitalik [Buterin] and others to potentially go back to help run the Ethereum Foundation,"" Ryan revealed in a candid interview with CoinDesk. But as the non-profit behind the second-largest blockchain underwent a dramatic leadership reshuffle, Ryan's trajectory unexpectedly shifted elsewhere — towards bringing Ethereum to Wall Street.

The changes at the Ethereum Foundation came amid growing community unrest. Critics blamed the foundation for their perception that Ethereum was losing momentum to ascendant rivals like Solana. The reshuffling included moving Aya Miyaguchi, the foundation's executive director since 2018, to the role of president.

Rather than Ryan taking Miyaguchi's previous position, the foundation's day-to-day leadership transferred to Hsiao-Wei Wang, an EF researcher, and Tomasz Stańczak, the founder of Ethereum's Nethermind client software.

The Ethereum Foundation, a Swiss non-profit, is the main organization supporting the development of the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem. It stewards a treasury of Ethereum's ether (ETH) tokens, which it distributes through grants to ecosystem projects. It also staffs a team of developers and researchers who play a key role in coordinating updates and shaping the chain's roadmap.

In January, as the EF leadership shakeup was underway, Ryan ""ended up mutually parting ways"" with Buterin and the foundation, he said. ""Soon after, I got introduced to Vivek [Raman],"" one of the founders of Etherealize, a new firm aimed at bringing ether (ETH) products to Wall Street. In March, Ryan announced he would be joining Etherealize as a co-founder.

Ryan says he made the move because he believes Ethereum is at a technological inflection point: ""Ethereum is much bigger than the EF. It's not just a couple of changes at the EF that are going to make or break Ethereum at large.""

According to Ryan, what the ecosystem needs now more than ever is to get its technology into the hands of real users. ""The only reason that things are maybe more existential right now than in times past is that the world is actually ready to adopt these systems,"" said Ryan. ""It is existential that Ethereum — a truly open, decentralized, permissionless platform — is the one that's adopted.""

From Web3 to Wall Street

At Etherealize, Ryan aims to connect Ethereum's technical ecosystem with institutional finance. The company is developing financial products that will make Ethereum more accessible to traditional investors while maintaining the blockchain's core values.

As a researcher at the EF, Ryan played a central role in mapping out Ethereum’s ambitious upgrade from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, known as the Merge. He believes his close ties to one of the most influential organizations in the Ethereum space will benefit his new work at Etherealize.

“Me coming on board, we get to kind of make that bridge bi-directional. I have deep Ethereum context – I helped build the protocol,” Ryan said. “I know all the people working on it. I know the challenges at hand and understand how things might unfold over the next few years. And so I can serve as a bridge from Ethereum back into the real world.”

As for Ryan's role, specifically, his responsibilities are not totally defined: ""I would love for Etherealize to take on the mandate of doing some open [research and development], and being a player in layer-1 or layer-2 or application layer R&D. But we're still kind of figuring out the lay of the land there.""

Industry watchers note that Ryan's move comes at a pivotal moment for both Ethereum and institutional crypto adoption. With a new regulatory environment for crypto under U.S. President Donald Trump, traditional financial firms — in the United States, in particular — are expected to become more comfortable adopting blockchain technology. Ryan hopes his technical bona fides could help these integrations meet Wall Street's rigorous standards without compromising on crypto's core ideals.

“We plan to bring the entire world onto Ethereum to whatever extent that we can, and having a deep technical background and understanding about Ethereum from a very fundamental way is going to help us do that,” Ryan said.

Looking ahead for the Ethereum Foundation

When asked about the timing of his departure from the EF amid growing criticisms of the organization, Ryan offered a measured perspective. ""A lot of what we've seen is just market dynamics, regardless of fundamental value, painting people's perspectives on things, and they sometimes look for someone to blame or put a finger at,"" he explained, referencing the ETH price volatility that has sometimes colored public sentiment about the project.

Ryan remains optimistic about the changes coming to the foundation he once considered leading. ""I'm excited for some new blood,"" he said. ""I've known Aya since January 2018; we've worked very closely together for years. I've said publicly that I admire her leadership, and I think she's made a number of really important calls on how to run the EF.""

He added that he's ""excited for the two leaders"" that were elevated to replace Miyaguchi. ""They have very technical backgrounds and a deep understanding of Ethereum, both the positive and the negative in terms of the construction of the protocol.""

Lithuanian national and Russian resident Aleksej Besciokov, 46, was reportedly arrested by police in the Indian state of Kerala, while vacationing on the country’s southern coast with his family, Techcrunch and KrebsonSecurity reported.

Last week, a coalition of international law enforcement agencies from the U.S., Germany and Finland seized Garantex’s domains and servers and froze nearly $28 million in crypto tied to the exchange with the help of stablecoin issuer Tether. The exchange was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) in 2022, for knowingly facilitating money laundering for ransomware actors, including Conti and Black Basta, and darknet markets like Hydra, the largest such market in the world before its closure in 2022.

In addition to allegedly facilitating money laundering for criminals, including North Korea’s in-house hacking squad the Lazarus Group, which was behind the massive $1.5 billion Bybit heist last month, Garantex reportedly played a large role in sanctions evasion. Upscale sanctions evasion services like the TGR Group, which cater to Russian oligarchs, have been connected to the exchange.

“I would have been very very surprised if they approved any of these filings before [Paul] Atkins was confirmed at their first deadlines,” said James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “It’s been our assumption that anything that can be pushed until Atkins is officially at the SEC, will be pushed back.”

A person familiar with the matter told CoinDesk that they agree with that view. “This administration has shown an ability to break precedent, so I guess it’s within the realm of possibility to see an early approval. I’d be surprised, but you never know,” the person said.

President Donald Trump named former SEC commissioner and current CEO of Patomak Global Partners Paul Atkins as his pick to lead the agency. Former SEC Chair Gary Gensler resigned from the position in January ahead of the inauguration of Trump. No hearing has been scheduled yet for the confirmation of Atkins, however.

The agency delayed decisions on several spot crypto ETFs on Tuesday, including XRP, Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Litecoin (LTC), a move that while not completely expected, wasn’t shocking either, according to Seyffart.

It took issuers years to receive the SEC’s green lights on launching spot bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) ETFs, even despite the fact that there had been a well-established regulated futures market for both assets. While this is not a legal requirement in order to launch ETFs based on an asset, it was an important criteria for the SEC in launching ETFs tied to BTC and ETH.

None of the currently outstanding ETF applications fulfil that criteria. Nevertheless, Seyffart and his colleagues see odds for an approval for several altcoin ETFs by the end of the year at 65% or higher. While some of the applications that are due for a decision in May and June are more likely to see an approval then, it all depends on the confirmation of the new chair.

In its reviews of past spot Bitcoin and Ether ETF applications, the SEC usually took advantage of the procedural delays it's allowed to use to extend deadlines to close to 240 days — the longest amount of time it has to approve or reject an application.

“Theoretically we should have a chair by then but I wouldn’t necessarily say it’s guaranteed that these things will be approved immediately then either. Certainly more possible than the March and April deadline for these different spot crypto assets,” Seyffart said.",coindesk

The case, which has dragged on since December 2020 when the SEC accused Ripple of raising over $1.3 billion through unregistered sales of its closely related XRP token, may finally be wrapping up — though not without last-minute wrangling over its terms.

Sources told Fox that Ripple’s legal team is pushing to renegotiate aspects of a pivotal 2023 ruling by District Judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District of New York (SDNY). That decision ordered Ripple to pay a $125 million penalty for its institutional XRP sales, which the court deemed unregistered securities offerings while sparing the company the nearly $2 billion fine the SEC had demanded. The SEC appealed Torres' ruling shortly before former Chair Gary Gensler stepped down.

Torres' ruling was widely considered to be a win for Ripple at the time it was issued, because the court decided that its programmatic sales of XRP to exchanges for purchase by retail traders did not constitute securities transactions. However, now that the SEC and its new leadership is in a full-scale retreat from many of its investigations into crypto companies, and has agreed to drop ongoing enforcement suits against companies like Coinbase, Cumberland DRW and Kraken, Ripple's partial victory may not taste quite as sweet.

XRP climbed 3% on the news.

По данным источника Velo, на фоне роста цен совокупный открытый интерес к бессрочным фьючерсам, котирующимся на основных биржах, стабилизировался на NEAR 1,35 млрд XRP, при этом годовые ставки фондирования и совокупный объем дельта печати оказались отрицательными.

Отрицательные ставки финансирования означают, что короткие позиции платят контрагентам комиссию за KEEP своих медвежьих ставок открытыми. Это показывает доминирование медвежьих коротких позиций на рынке. Отрицательная кумулятивная дельта объема, которая измеряет чистый приток капитала на рынок, указывает на то, что объем продаж накопился больше, чем объем покупок, что потенциально сигнализирует о медвежьем тренде.

Эти пересечения SMA широко отслеживаются трейдерами тренда, что означает, что подтверждение креста смерти может вызвать большее давление продаж на рынке.

Непрерывный контракт — это рассчитанное представление серии последовательно истекающих фьючерсных контрактов, что позволяет проводить непрерывный исторический ряд данных для анализа.

Спред сузился до $495, самого низкого значения с 5 ноября, достигнув пика в $1705 17 декабря, согласно источнику данных TradingView. Другими словами, он полностью отменил подъем Трампа, что является признаком ослабления бычьих настроений на рынке.

«Сужение спреда между фьючерсами на Bitcoin CME с исполнением в ближайшем и следующем месяце может указывать на то, что трейдеры смягчают свои ценовые ожидания», — сказал Томас Эрдёши, руководитель отдела продуктов в CF Benchmarks, в интервью CoinDesk.

Спред фьючерсов BTC CME на следующий месяц и на ближайший месяц. (TradingView/ CoinDesk)

Смягчение влияния Трампа, вероятно, означает, что рынок уже не считает, что прокриптовалютный президент в Белом доме полезен для отрасли, и макроэкономические корреляции снова играют ведущую роль.

«Мы видим, что базис контракта с опережением срока переоценился существенно ниже с начала марта, что свидетельствует об умеренных NEAR ожиданиях того, что основной катализатор недавнего Rally— избрание президента Трампа — полностью учтен в ценах», — сказал Эрдоси.

Это уже происходит. И BTC , и технологический индекс Уолл-стрит Nasdaq упали на 20% и 8% соответственно с начала февраля из-за множества факторов, включая геополитическую неопределенность, тарифы Трампа и перспективы инфляции и экономического роста.

Кроме того, рынку Bitcoin пришлось переварить разочарование из-за отсутствия новых покупок в стратегическом плане резерва цифровых активов Трампа. На прошлой неделе Трамп подписал указ, предписывающий создание стратегического резерва, включающего BTC , изъятые в ходе принудительных действий.

«Объявление о стратегическом резерве Bitcoin — это не то, на что надеялся рынок. Многие ожидали, что резерв купит новые Bitcoin, но вместо этого они заявили, что не будут продавать ни существующие Bitcoin , ни конфискованные Bitcoin. Хотя это позитивный шаг, он привел к резкому падению цены биткоина», — сообщил в электронном письме CoinDesk Ян Балина, основатель и генеральный директор Token Metrics.

Фьючерсы все еще в контанго

Хотя спред между фьючерсными контрактами CME на следующий и ближайший месяцы сузился, вся кривая остается в состоянии контанго, при котором фьючерсные контракты с более поздней датой исполнения (с более длительными сроками погашения) торгуются с премией по сравнению с фьючерсными контрактами с более поздней датой исполнения.

Так обычно происходит на всех Рынки из-за таких факторов, как хранение, финансирование, расходы на страхование и ожидания роста цен в ближайшие недели или месяцы.

«Тот факт, что ставки бессрочного финансирования остаются положительными, а фьючерсная база все еще находится в состоянии контанго, говорит о том, что недавнее движение обусловлено сокращением длинных позиций по спотовым позициям без кредитного плеча, а не более широкой рыночной инфекцией», — отметил Эрдёши.",coindesk

Новое будущее для TikTok

Пока TikTok принимает решение о будущем владельце,Проект Свободаобъединился сАлексис Оганян,соучредитель Reddit и пионер в создании онлайн-сообществ, а такжеКевин О'Лири, известный инвестор и предприниматель, известный своей ролью вАквариум с акулами, чтобы сделать платформу ончейн. Зачем?

По CORE, это больше, чем просто TikTok. Это о том, кто контролирует цифровые пространства, где миллиарды людей соединяются, создают и потребляют информацию. Слишком долго самые яркие сообщества интернета формировались — и в конечном итоге управлялись — горсткой корпораций. Project Liberty возглавляет движение за изменение этого, гарантируя, что социальные сети будут служить людям, которые их поддерживают, а не только тем, кто ими владеет.

Ключом к этому сдвигу является Frequency, публичный, не требующий разрешений блокчейн, разработанный Технологии командой Project Liberty и специально предназначенный для массовых социальных сетей, укрепляющий основу интернета, управляемого пользователями, отдавая приоритет совместимости, суверенитету данных и устойчивости к централизованному контролю. Вместе эти инициативы направлены на то, чтобы отвести социальные сети от корпоративной собственности и перейти к открытой, контролируемой пользователем модели.

TikTok, несмотря на все его культурное влияние, ничем не отличается. Поскольку дебаты о его правах собственности и методах работы с данными продолжаются, более масштабный вопрос остается нерешенным: должен ли единый субъект, будь то правительство или корпорация, контролировать социальную структуру поколения? На карту поставлено T только то, кому принадлежит TikTok, но и то, может ли платформа такого масштаба работать за пределами централизованного контроля. Если ее переосмыслить в рамках децентрализованной структуры, ей потребуется фундамент, построенный на настоящей совместимости, принадлежащих пользователям данных и открытом управлении. Вот тут-то и появляется Frequency.

От TikTok до Bluesky: создание децентрализованного будущего

Вопрос о будущем TikTok подчеркивает гораздо более масштабный сдвиг в том, как мы думаем о социальных сетях. Необходимость децентрализации уже не теоретическая, это насущная необходимость. Bluesky, проект социальных сетей с открытым исходным кодом, является ONE из попыток ответить на этот призыв.

Bluesky — это не просто еще одна платформа, она представляет собой попытку переосмыслить отношения между пользователями и их цифровыми идентичностями. Но истинное цифровое освобождение требует большего, чем благие намерения, оно требует структурной приверженности полной децентрализации. Оно дает представление о том, как может выглядеть децентрализованная социальная сеть, но ключевые уязвимости остаются.

Bluesky, несмотря на все свои обещания, по-прежнему полагается на структурные узкие места, которые представляют риск для его долгосрочной децентрализации. Узлы хранения в значительной степени остаются централизованными под контролем Bluesky PBC или сторонних поставщиков, что означает, что пользовательские данные по-прежнему размещаются в местах, которые могут стать точками контроля. Системы Relay и Firehose, отвечающие за распределение данных, остаются сосредоточенными в руках немногих. И хотя позитивно, что Bluesky внедрила стандарт W3C для децентрализованных идентификаторов (DID), каталог PLC (Public Ledger of Credentials) также централизован. В настоящее время это может показаться мелкими техническими деталями, но история неоднократно показывала, как, казалось бы, незначительные технические решения могут стать теми самыми механизмами, посредством которых консолидируется власть и подрывается автономия.

Частота — основа децентрализованной социальной сети

Именно здесь Frequency выходит на сцену, не просто как блокчейн, а как совершенно новая структура для цифровой идентификации и управления социальными сетями. Frequency T просто изменяет текущую модель; она переосмысливает то, как мы взаимодействуем онлайн с самого начала. Вместо того, чтобы центральные власти диктовали условия, Frequency гарантирует, что пользователи, а не платформы, держат ключи от своей цифровой жизни.

Децентрализация — это больше, чем просто технический сдвиг, это восстановление фундаментальных прав. Пользователи должны иметь возможность предоставлять доступ к своим данным, но, что не менее важно, они должны иметь возможность отзывать его. Отношения, которые они выстраивают в сети — подписчики, связи, разговоры — должны принадлежать им, а не платформе, которая может манипулировать ими или стирать их по своему усмотрению.

Децентрализация со смыслом

Частота работает по принципу минимальной, целенаправленной децентрализации, что делает долгосрочную устойчивость экосистемы в масштабе населения жизнеспособной. Единственные данные, хранящиеся в цепочке, — это то, что необходимо для гарантии индивидуальных прав на данные. Такой подход к проектированию позволяет эффективно оптимизировать цепочку, сосредоточившись на CORE социальных Мероприятия, в первую очередь на активности, связанной с учетной записью, графиком и примитивами связи. Такой акцент на CORE социальных элементах позволяет разрабатывать токенизированные стимулы вокруг управления пропускной способностью сети, при этом конкретные стимулы для создателей, потребителей и других более конкретных участников оставляются на более высоких уровнях Технологии стека.

Обещание интернета, принадлежащего пользователю, будет неполным без надежных мер безопасности, защищающих персональные данные. Частота гарантирует, что пользователи имеют криптографическую защиту своей информации, а также детальный контроль, который определяет, как их данные будут передаваться. В то же время они должны иметь возможность налагать ограничения, специфичные для платформы, гарантируя, что их контент будет отображаться только в тех цифровых пространствах, где они хотят, чтобы его видели. Кроме того, они должны иметь возможность удалять свой контент по своему усмотрению. Они также должны иметь возможность ограничивать контент определенными платформами, если захотят это сделать.

Этот подход напрямую устраняет фундаментальные препятствия, которые мешали масштабированию предыдущих попыток децентрализации. Частота гарантирует, что ни одна организация — даже ее собственные операторы узлов — не имеет полномочий изменять или цензурировать пользовательские данные. Она обеспечивает децентрализованное резервное копирование Firehose от Bluesky, гарантируя, что созданный пользователем контент останется доступным вне контроля одной стороны.

Достижение цифрового суверенитета

Интернет должен был быть открытым, взаимосвязанным и свободным. Но сегодня мы стоим на перепутье: либо мы продолжим полагаться на контролируемые корпорациями социальные сети, либо предпримем необходимые шаги для создания более открытого, принадлежащего пользователям цифрового будущего.

Bluesky — это шаг вперед, но без решения оставшихся проблем централизации он рискует превратиться в еще один огороженный сад, возможно, немного более ONE, но все же такой , где пользователи не имеют настоящего контроля. TikTok представляет собой еще большую проблему. Дебаты о его владении упускают суть. Настоящий вопрос T , кто должен владеть TikTok, а в том, должен ли вообще принадлежать какой-либо гигант социальных сетей в традиционном смысле. Децентрализация предлагает новый путь вперед, где платформы строятся вокруг суверенитета пользователей, а не корпоративного контроля.

С Frequency мы становимся на шаг ближе к возвращению изначального обещания Интернета. Настоящее цифровое освобождение требует освобождения от монополий на данные, которые определили эпоху социальных сетей. Это T просто технологическое обновление, это необходимая смена власти.",coindesk

Ардоино выделялся из толпы не своим богатством, а выбором одежды. В то время как другие одевались, чтобы произвести впечатление, он выбрал непринужденный образ — светло-голубое поло Ralph Lauren и серые брюки цвета хаки — несмотря на то, что у него, вероятно, были самые глубокие карманы в комнате.

«Это моя первая поездка в Америку», — начал он. «Там красиво. Я чувствую себя очень желанным гостем».

Ардоино действительно долгое время избегал этой страны. Этот итальянский ученый-компьютерщик до недавнего времени в основном сосредоточивал деятельность Tether на развивающихся регионах, ставя своей целью финансовую свободу.

Другой причиной может быть то, что Tether уже некоторое время находится под пристальным вниманием лидеров отрасли, а также властей США, включая Министерство юстиции (DOJ), Комиссию по торговле товарами и фьючерсами (CFTC) и Департамент финансовых услуг штата Нью-Йорк (NYFSD).

Это изменилось. Ардоино был в туре по США на прошлой неделе,размещение фотографийсебя на ступенях здания Капитолия США в Вашингтоне, округ Колумбия, в четверг и участие вбеседа у камина с генеральным директором Strike Джеком Маллерсом на мероприятии во вторник, организованном Институтом Политика Bitcoin .

Компания, которой, по словам Ардоино, руководят всего 150 сотрудников в 50 странах, обосноваласьобвинения в CFTC и запрос NYDFSв 2021 году. Быломногочисленные отчетыпродолжающегося расследования Министерства юстиции в отношении эмитента стейблкоинов, которое также проводилось в течение последних нескольких лет.

«Мы прошли через ад», — сказал Ардоино участникам конференции. «Люди говорили, что если я приеду в США, меня арестуют... Они попытаются вас запугать».

«Мы ведь все еще здесь, да?»

После краткого обзора предыдущих успехов Tether в бизнесе стейблкоинов (по сообщениям, в 2024 году компания получила прибыль в размере 13 миллиардов долларов, а ее стейблкоин USDT занимает более 60% доли рынка среди стейблкоинов) Ардоино продолжил представлять текущие проекты, над которыми работает компания, включая ее усилия в области образования, искусственного интеллекта и токенизации реальных активов (RWA).

«Перспективы на этот год также замечательные», — сказал Ардоино.

Путешествие Ardoino в США пришлось на время, когда законодательный орган США продвигается вперед в регулировании рынка стейблкоинов стоимостью $200 млрд. и быстрорастущего рынка. Tether доминирует в классе активов со своей Криптовалюта USDT стоимостью $143 млрд., за ним следует американский конкурент Circle со своим токеном USDC стоимостью $58 млрд.

Хотя Tether является офшорной компанией (она недавно объявила о намерении открыть свою штаб-квартиру в Сальвадоре) и пока не проявила интереса к официальному выходу на американский рынок Криптo , ее связи с США многогранны.

Фирма является ONE из крупнейших покупателей долга США, проведение Почти $100 млрд. казначейских облигаций США и государственных ценных бумаг в качестве резервного актива для его токена USDT . Если бы это была страна, она была бы среди 20 крупнейших держателей долга США. Министр финансов Скотт БессентсказалВ ходе саммита по цифровым активам в Белом доме в пятницу было заявлено, что стейблкоины являются ключом к сохранению доллара США в качестве доминирующей резервной валюты в мире, и эту линию аргументации Ардоино расхваливалнесколько случаи до.

Компания также приобрела влиятельного союзника в администрации Трампа в лице министра торговли Говарда Лютника, бывшего генерального директора Cantor Fitzgerald, инвестиционной компании с Уолл-стрит, которая управляет активами Tether в казначействе США. The Wall Street Journalсообщиличто Cantor также инвестировал в холдинговую компанию Tether, в то время как Lutnickсказал во время слушаний по утверждению его кандидатуры Cantor владеет конвертируемыми облигациями Tether , но не имеет доли в капитале.

Ардоино в интервью CoinDesk в прошлом году сказал: сказал что фирма также привлекла к своей платформе такие американские агентства, как ФБР и Secret служба, в целях борьбы с незаконной деятельностью.

На инвестиционном фронте Tether стал крупный акционер с инвестициями в размере $775 млн в американскую платформу обмена видео Rumble, популярную среди консервативных и правых пользователей США. При поддержке Tether генеральный директор Rumble Крис Павлоски изложил планы по внедрению Криптo и поддержке платежей с помощью USDT, BTC и обеспеченного золотом токена Tether XAUT.

Компания Hemi, основанная одним из первых разработчиков Bitcoin Джеффом Гарзиком, планирует объединить Bitcoin и Ethereum, два старейших и крупнейших блокчейна, в «единую суперсеть», говорится в сообщении, отправленном по электронной почте.

Однако кодирование Bitcoin не позволяет изначально реализовывать некоторые функции, необходимые DeFi, такие как смарт-контракты или доказательства с нулевым разглашением, поэтому возникла необходимость в создании моста между этой утилитой и Ethereum.

«Я вел переговоры с Виталиком [Бутериным] и другими о возможном возвращении для помощи в управлении Ethereum Foundation», — рассказал Райан в откровенном интервью CoinDesk. Но когда некоммерческая организация, стоящая за вторым по величине блокчейном, претерпела драматические кадровые перестановки в руководстве, траектория Райана неожиданно сместилась в другую сторону — в сторону вывода Ethereum на Уолл-стрит.

Изменения в Ethereum Foundation произошли на фоне растущих волнений в сообществе. Критики обвинили фонд в том, что, по их мнению, Ethereum теряет импульс из-за восходящих конкурентов, таких как Solana. Перестановки включали перемещение Аи Миягучи, исполнительного директора фонда с 2018 года, на должность президента.

Вместо того, чтобы Райан занял предыдущую должность Миягути, повседневное руководство фондом перешло к Сяо-Вэю Вану, исследователю EF, и Томашу Станчаку, основателю клиентского программного обеспечения Nethermind для Ethereum.

Ethereum Foundation, швейцарская некоммерческая организация, является основной организацией, поддерживающей развитие экосистемы блокчейна Ethereum . Она управляет казной токенов Ethereum (ETH), которые она распределяет через гранты на проекты экосистемы. Она также нанимает команду разработчиков и исследователей, которые играют ключевую роль в координации обновлений и формировании дорожной карты цепи.

В январе, когда происходила перестановка в руководстве EF, Райан «в итоге расстался» с Бутериным и фондом, сказал он. «Вскоре после этого я познакомился с Вивеком [Раманом]», ONE из основателей Etherealize, новой фирмы, нацеленной на вывод эфирных (ETH) продуктов на Уолл-стрит. В марте Райан объявил, что присоединится к Etherealize в качестве соучредителя.

Райан говорит, что он сделал этот шаг, потому что считает, что Ethereum находится на переломном этапе в технологическом плане: «Ethereum намного больше, чем EF. Это не просто пара изменений в EF, которые создадут или разрушат Ethereum в целом».

По словам Райана, сейчас экосистеме как никогда нужно передать свои Технологии в руки реальных пользователей. «Единственная причина, по которой сейчас все, возможно, более экзистенциально, чем в прошлые времена, заключается в том, что мир на самом деле готов принять эти системы», — сказал Райан. «Экзистенциально, что Ethereum — по-настоящему открытая, децентрализованная, не требующая разрешений платформа — ONE ».

От Web3 до Уолл-стрит

В Etherealize Райан стремится связать техническую экосистему Ethereum с институциональными Финансы. Компания разрабатывает финансовые продукты, которые сделают Ethereum более доступным для традиционных инвесторов, сохраняя при этом CORE ценности блокчейна.

Будучи исследователем в EF, Райансыграл центральную рольпри планировании амбициозного обновления Ethereum с доказательства выполнения работы на доказательство доли владения,известный как слияниеОн считает, что его тесные связи с ONE из самых влиятельных организаций в пространстве Ethereum пойдут на пользу его новой работе в Etherealize.

«С моим приходом на борт мы как бы делаем этот мост двусторонним. У меня глубокий контекст Ethereum — я помогал создавать протокол», — сказал Райан. «Я знаю всех людей, работающих над ним. Я знаю текущие проблемы и понимаю, как все может развернуться в течение следующих нескольких лет. И поэтому я могу служить мостом от Ethereum обратно в реальный мир».

Что касается роли Райана, то его обязанности не полностью определены: «Я бы хотел, чтобы Etherealize взяла на себя мандат на проведение некоторых открытых [исследований и разработок] и стала игроком на уровне 1, 2 или прикладном уровне НИОКР. Но мы все еще выясняем, как обстоят дела в этом вопросе».

Наблюдатели отрасли отмечают, что действия Райана происходят в поворотный момент как для Ethereum , так и для институционального принятия Криптo . С новой нормативной средой для Криптo при президенте США Дональде Трампе, традиционные финансовые компании — в частности, в Соединенных Штатах — как ожидается, будут более комфортно принимать Технологии блокчейна. Райан надеется, что его технические добросовестные решения помогут этим интеграциям соответствовать строгим стандартам Уолл-стрит, не идя на компромисс с CORE идеалами криптовалют.

«Мы планируем охватить весь мир Ethereum настолько, насколько это возможно, и наличие глубокого технического опыта и глубокого понимания Ethereum поможет нам в этом», — сказал Райан.

Взгляд в будущее Ethereum Foundation

Когда Райана спросили о сроках его ухода из EF на фоне растущей критики организации, он высказал взвешенную точку зрения. «Многое из того, что мы видели, — это просто динамика рынка, независимо от фундаментальной ценности, которая рисует взгляды людей на вещи, и они иногда ищут, кого бы обвинить или на кого бы указать пальцем», — объяснил он, имея в виду волатильность цены ETH , которая иногда влияла на общественное мнение о проекте.

Райан сохраняет оптимизм в отношении изменений, которые ожидают фонд, который он когда-то считал руководителем. «Я рад притоку новой крови», — сказал он. «Я знаю Айю с января 2018 года; мы много лет тесно сотрудничали. Я публично заявлял, что восхищаюсь ее лидерством, и я думаю, что она сделала ряд действительно важных решений о том, как управлять EF».

Он добавил, что он «рад за двух лидеров», которые были назначены на смену Миягути. «У них очень технический бэкграунд и глубокое понимание Ethereum, как положительного, так и отрицательного с точки зрения построения протокола».

Агентствоотложенные решения По словам Сейффарта, во вторник произошло резкое падение котировок нескольких спотовых Криптo ETF, включая XRP, Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE) и Litecoin (LTC). Этот шаг, хотя и не был полностью ожидаемым, также T стал шокирующим.

Эмитентам потребовались годы, чтобы получить зеленый свет SEC на запуск спотовых Bitcoin (BTC) и эфира (ETH) ETF, даже несмотря на то, что для обоих активов существовал хорошо налаженный регулируемый фьючерсный рынок. Хотя это не является юридическим требованием для запуска ETF, основанных на активе, это был важный критерий для SEC при запуске ETF, привязанных к BTC и ETH.

Ни одна из текущих заявок ETF не соответствует этому критерию. Тем не менее, Сейфарт и его коллеги оценивают вероятность одобрения нескольких альткоиновых ETF к концу года в 65% или выше. Хотя некоторые заявки, которые должны быть рассмотрены в мае и июне, с большей вероятностью будут одобрены тогда, все зависит от утверждения нового председателя.

В своих обзорах прошлых заявок на биржевые фонды Bitcoin и Ether Комиссия по ценным бумагам и биржам (SEC) обычно пользовалась разрешенными ей процедурными задержками, чтобы продлить сроки почти до 240 дней — максимального срока, в течение которого она может одобрить или отклонить заявку.

«Теоретически к тому времени у нас должен быть председатель, но я бы T сказал, что это гарантированно, что эти вещи будут одобрены немедленно. Конечно, это более возможно, чем крайний срок в марте и апреле для этих различных спотовых Криптo », — сказал Сейфарт.",coindesk

Дело, которое тянется с декабря 2020 года, когда Комиссия по ценным бумагам и биржам (SEC) обвинила Ripple в привлечении более 1,3 млрд долларов США путем незарегистрированных продаж тесно связанного с ней токена XRP , может наконец-то завершиться — хотя и не без споров по поводу его условий в последнюю минуту.

Это решение предписало Ripple выплатить штраф в размере 125 миллионов долларов за институциональные продажи XRP , которые суд счел незарегистрированными предложениями ценных бумаг, избавив компанию от штрафа в размере почти 2 миллиардов долларов, который потребовала SEC. SEC подал апелляциюРешение Торреса было вынесено незадолго до отставки бывшего председателя Гэри Генслера.

Решение Торреса было широко расценено как WIN Ripple на момент его вынесения, поскольку суд постановил, что его программные продажи XRP на биржах для покупки розничными трейдерами не являются сделками с ценными бумагами.

The Nebraska-based company has the ""right product at the right time,"" wrote analyst Mark Palmer.

The need for self-custody was underscored in recent weeks, when crypto exchange Bybit was the subject of a hack of 400,000 ether (ETH), worth about $1.5 billion.

Exodus Movement has lost more than 60% of its market cap in the last five weeks, Benchmark noted, giving a compelling entry point for investors looking for exposure to a company with ""strong operating momentum, the demonstrated ability to scale rapidly, and a tailwind from the accommodative stance toward the crypto space in the U.S.,"" the report said.

The recent weakness is not linked to concerns about the firm's operating performance, the report noted, as the company posted strong fourth-quarter results earlier this month.

Exodus Movement gets most of its revenue from its exchange aggregation feature, Benchmark said, and its ""wallet-as-a-service"" business leverages this technology in its crypto swap engine, which is integrated with platforms such as Ledger and Magic Eden.

The move is part of Rumble’s previously disclosed plan to adopt a bitcoin treasury strategy and allocate up to $20 million of its cash reserves to bitcoin. Rumble’s CEO Chris Pavlovski said the decision was part of its further involvement in the crypto industry.

“These holdings have the potential to serve as a valuable hedge against inflation and will not be subject to dilution like so many overprinted government-issued currencies,” Pavlovski said in a press release.

The company added that future acquisitions would be contingent on factors such as market conditions, bitcoin’s price, and Rumble’s cash flow needs. Late last year, leading stablecoin issuer Tether took a $775 million stake in the video-sharing platform.

BTC has recently taken a beating, falling from $100,000 last month to under $80,000 this week due to several factors, including risk aversion on Wall Street, concerns about Trump's tariffs and U.S. recession fears. The disappointment over the lack of fresh BTC purchases under Trump's strategic reserve plan added to the downward momentum.

However, as prices fell to multi-month lows below $80,000 on Tuesday, the relative strength index (RSI)—a widely followed momentum oscillator—did not confirm this decline. The indicator produced a higher low, contradicting the lower low on the price chart, confirming what is known as the bullish RSI divergence.

It indicates that while the price is going down, the momentum behind the selling is weakening, potentially signaling an upcoming reversal to a bullish trend.

The pattern couldn't have come at a more interesting time than today, as the U.S. consumer price index for February, scheduled for release at 12:30 UTC, is expected to show progress. BTC's bullish divergence of the RSI means the stage is set for a positive response to a potential soft reading.

According to CNBC, the data is expected to show that the headline CPI and the core figure, which excludes food and energy, increased by 0.3% month-on-month in February. That implies an annualized reading of 2.9% for the headline CPI and 3.2% for the core, both 0.1 percentage point lower than in January.

Au milieu de la hausse des prix, l'intérêt ouvert cumulé sur les contrats à terme perpétuels cotés sur les principales bourses s'est stabilisé à NEAR de 1,35 milliard de XRP, avec des taux de financement annualisés et un delta de volume cumulé négatifs, selon la source de données Velo.

« Le rétrécissement de l'écart entre les contrats à terme Bitcoin du CME du mois prochain et du mois prochain pourrait suggérer que les traders modèrent leurs attentes de prix », a déclaré Thomas Erdösi, responsable produit chez CF Benchmarks, à CoinDesk.

Le dénouement de l'influence de Trump signifie probablement que le marché a dépassé le discours selon lequel un président pro-crypto à la Maison Blanche est bon pour l'industrie, et que les corrélations macroéconomiques sont de retour aux commandes.

« Ce que nous pouvons voir, c'est que la base du contrat à terme a été considérablement revue à la baisse depuis le début du mois de mars, ce qui indique une modération des attentes à NEAR terme selon lesquelles le principal catalyseur du récent Rally- l'élection du président Trump - a été pleinement intégré », a déclaré Erdosi.

C'est déjà le cas. Le BTC et le Nasdaq, l'indice technologique de Wall Street, ont tous deux chuté de 20 % et 8 % respectivement depuis début février, en raison de multiples facteurs, notamment l'incertitude géopolitique, les droits de douane imposés par Trump et les perspectives d'inflation et de croissance économique.

De plus, le marché du Bitcoin a dû digérer la déception suscitée par l'absence de nouveaux achats dans le cadre du plan stratégique de Trump pour la réserve d'actifs numériques. La semaine dernière, Trump a signé un décret ordonnant la création d'une réserve stratégique incluant les BTC saisis lors des mesures d'exécution.

« L'annonce concernant la Réserve stratégique de Bitcoin ne correspond pas aux attentes du marché. Beaucoup s'attendaient à ce que la Réserve achète de nouveaux Bitcoin, mais ils ont au contraire déclaré qu'ils ne vendraient aucun de leurs Bitcoin existants ni Bitcoin confisqués. Bien que cette initiative soit positive, elle a provoqué une forte baisse du cours du Bitcoin », a déclaré Ian Balina, fondateur et PDG de Token Metrics, à CoinDesk par e-mail.

Les contrats à terme sont toujours en contango

Bien que l'écart entre les contrats à terme du CME du mois prochain et du mois à venir se soit réduit, la courbe entière reste en contango, où les contrats à terme à échéance lointaine (avec des échéances plus longues) se négocient avec une prime par rapport à ceux à échéance proche.

C'est généralement le cas sur tous les Marchés en raison de facteurs tels que le stockage, le financement, les coûts d'assurance et les attentes de hausse des prix au cours des semaines ou des mois à venir.

« Le fait que les taux de financement perpétuels restent positifs et que la base des contrats à terme soit toujours en contango suggère que le mouvement récent est dû à la compression des positions longues au comptant sans effet de levier, plutôt qu'à une contagion plus large du marché », a noté Erdösi.",coindesk

Les démocrates et le parti Naleraq, qui arrive en deuxième position, sont tous deux favorables à l'indépendance vis-à-vis du Danemark, mais à des rythmes différents.

PUBLICITÉ

Le parti indépendantiste de centre droit Demokraatit du Groenland a remporté le plus grand nombre de voix avec près de 30 % lors des élections législatives de mardi, un résultat surprenant alors que l'île se rendait aux urnes dans un contexte de menaces de Donald Trump de prendre le contrôle de l'île.

Il est suivi par le parti Naleraq, qui a obtenu environ 25 %.

Le parti Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA) est arrivé en troisième position avec plus de 21 %, tandis que le parti de gauche Siumut est arrivé en quatrième position avec près de 15 % des voix.

La victoire inattendue de Demokraatit sur les partis qui gouvernent le territoire depuis des années montre que de nombreux Groenlandais se soucient tout autant des soins de santé, de l'éducation, du patrimoine culturel et d'autres politiques sociales.

En février, le Premier ministre Mute Bourup Egede a convoqué des élections anticipées, affirmant que le pays devait être uni pendant une ""période grave"" qui ne ressemble à rien de ce que le Groenland a connu.

Le président américain Donald Trump n'a pas caché son désir de contrôler le Groenland, déclarant la semaine dernière lors d'une session conjointe du Congrès qu'il pensait que les États-Unis allaient l'obtenir ""d'une manière ou d'une autre"".

Le Groenland, région autonome du Danemark, se trouve à cheval sur des routes aériennes et maritimes stratégiques dans l'Atlantique Nord et possède de riches gisements de minéraux de terres rares nécessaires à la fabrication de toutes sortes de produits, des téléphones portables aux technologies d'énergie renouvelable.

L'Inuit Ataqatigiit (Inuit unis) d'Egede était largement pressenti pour remporter le scrutin, suivi par le Siumut - deux partis qui ont dominé la vie politique du Groenland ces dernières années.

L'île de 56 000 habitants s'est engagée sur la voie de l'indépendance depuis au moins 2009, et les 31 législateurs élus façonneront l'avenir de l'île, qui se demande si le moment est venu de déclarer son indépendance.

Quatre des cinq principaux partis en lice recherchent l'indépendance, mais ne sont pas d'accord sur le moment et la manière de le faire.

Ineos Automotive, the vehicle maker owned by multi-billionaire businessman and Manchester United co-owner, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, has recalled more than 7,000 of its sport utility vehicles (SUVs) in the US.

The recall centres on latches that may not engage properly, which could lead to the doors on Grenadier SUVs opening while being driven ""increasing the risk of injury to passengers inside the vehicle.""

To fix the problem, Ineos says it will replace all door button assemblies on the affected vehicles, free of charge.

The recall is the latest issue faced by the car company, which last year had to temporarily pause manufacturing after one of its parts suppliers became insolvent.

The recall affects Ineos' Grenadier SUVs produced between 6 July 2023 and 19 April 2024.

The door button mechanism on affected vehicles may have been assembled without enough grease in them, according to a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) filing.

""This may allow the exterior door buttons to remain in the depressed position and prevent the door from fully latching,"" the document said.

Launched in 2022, the Grenadier was the first vehicle produced by Ineos Automotive. It is inspired by the iconic Land Rover Defender.

Sir Jim's decision to start the car company was motivated by his disappointment over Jaguar Land Rover's decision to stop making the Defender.

In 2020, the entrepreneur, who had campaigned for Leave in the run-up to the 2016 Brexit referendum, announced that the vehicle would be assembled in France, putting an end to hopes that it would be made at a plant in Wales.

According to the company, there are currently about 20,000 Grenadiers on the road in 50 countries around the world.

Ineos Automotive lost more than 1.4 billion euros (£1.1bn, $1.5bn) before tax in 2023, according to a filing with the UK registry Companies House.

Florida Car Salesman Accused Of Washing Titles

A Florid man was just hit with 21 criminal charges after authorities accused him of washing car titles. What’s even more shocking is the same man was arrested in January and hit with 12 charges, also for washing car titles. But wait, there’s more.

Used EV prices are tanking.

The man, 40-year-old Ahmed Njie, is a used car salesman. In other words, his victims weren’t just buying vehicles from a random private party. If you thought you only had to worry about this kind of thing when not shopping at a dealership, think again.

Advertisement Advertisement

According to a report from Fox13 Tampa Bay, authorities believe Njie is part of a large criminal organization that’s moving stolen cars, passing them off as legitimate and fooling shoppers.

Authorities have been investigating Njie for about a year. He’s now being held without a bond.

Title washing is when someone changes the VIN on a car, then getting the vehicle re-titled so it has a fresh title with that fraudulent VIN. Oftentimes, they’ll use a VIN from the same make, model, even paint color of a ride that’s been totaled and is no longer on the road.

With car theft rates still high, your chances of buying a stolen ride with a washed title is higher than most people would guess. When most people learn about this type of crime, they assume buying from a dealership will protect them. Sadly, it doesn’t always go that way.

While in this case we have a dealership employee who’s accused of washing titles, sometimes dealers are victims of these crimes. We’ve seen dealerships buy stolen cars, not detect the title is a forgery, then resell the vehicle to a customer, who month or years later learns the horrible truth.

One surefire way to guard against title washing scams is to check the VIN for a car on a location other than the dash or driver’s door jamb. Different vehicles have those VINs stamped or etched into different locations, like on the engine block or frame. Scammers can’t or won’t change those VINs because they’re harder to reach.

Stolen Car Owner Hit With Thousands In Impound Fees

Imagine having your car stolen, then finding out months later it not only was recovered but sat in an impound lot, accruing thousands in storage fees. That’s the reality a man in the Washington, D.C. area is facing after nobody thought to contact him about his recovered ride.

Used electric car prices have taken a big hit.

Normally, when your car has been stolen and then is found, someone calls the owner or at least drops a notice in the mail. But Andrew Passie tells NBC Washington he didn’t hear anything after his vehicle was stolen in front of his house in mid-November.

Advertisement Advertisement

Instead, in late January he called his local police department to see if there was an update. While he was delighted to hear it had been recovered, at the time the man didn’t realize a big bill was coming his way.

In the meantime, the vehicle was towed and put in an impound lot where fees are $20 a day. After sitting for 97 days, plus a $100 towing fee, it’s going to cost the guy $2,040 before he can get it out.

For someone who’s just scraping by, that’s a significant amount of money. He’s struggled with hardship since his vehicle, which he uses to take his kids to school and commute to work, was stolen.

Unfortunately, we see stories like this one way too often. Police and impound lots don’t always contact owners when stolen cars are found and towed away. In a lot of cases the insurance company would be on the hook because the owner would file a claim and no longer own the ride.

But in this case, Passie has to bear the burden of the fees. He’s mad at D.C. Police for not contacting him. We bet they deal with so many stolen cars, since theft there is rampant, they don’t have the resources to reach out to every owner. That’s a sad reality.

The big takeaway here is if your car gets stolen, you need to be proactive in following up with police. Don’t worry about being annoying, because if you don’t bug them you too could be stuck with a big impound lot fee.

For Sale: Cadillac Escalade Stretch Limo

If you’ve always dreamed of starting your own limousine service, this Cadillac Escalade stretch limo might be a great way to jump into the market. The thing is long, loaded with features, looks great, and has low mileage. Just you have to be able to afford it.

Woman makes a tiny electric car her home.

Based off a 2023 Cadillac Escalade ESV, the seller says this limo is 200 feet long and we believe it. Apparently, it can accommodate 20 passengers, letting them make quite the dramatic entrance to events thanks to the gullwing door.

This is the kind of vehicle someone rents for top dollar to get plenty of attention. While the exterior looks fancy enough, the interior is all custom with light effects in the ceiling and on different trim pieces, allowing you to create different moods to suit customers’ preferences.

Also, it appears there are a couple of minibars inside, because with 20 passengers there are going to be a lot of thirsty people as you’re tooling around town.

On the business side of things, the seller says there are two AC compressors to keep the rather large interior cool in the middle of the summer. Plus, there are two alternators to power all the onboard gadgetry.

We can’t counsel you on how to start a limousine service, but we imagine one like this rents for a good chunk of change. However, it’s not cheap to buy wit ha price tag of $220,000. Sure, it only has 6,000 miles on the odometer, according to the seller, but we bet it gets single digit fuel economy and detailing it would be quite the chore.

Still, if your dream is to start an interesting side hustle and you can swing the lofty price tag for this Escalade limo, maybe this is the oddball vehicle of your dreams.

https://finance.yahoo.com,Lexus RZ Luxury EV Adds Shifts and Sounds with Refresh,https://autos.yahoo.com/lexus-rz-luxury-ev-adds-221500237.html,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 22:15:00 GMT","Lexus revealed an updated RZ in Brussels, which is slated for a launch in the fall of 2025.

The updated Lexus RZ will add an RZ 550e F Sport model, get a new steer-by-wire system, and add range.

Lexus is also adding a simulated shifting technology to synchronize with an “immersive sound” system.

Lexus has shown off an updated RZ lineup in Belgium, and it might be making its way to your local dealer this fall.

The updated Lexus RZ adds a new 550e F Sport variant, more battery capacity, and a revamped drive system. It also adds simulated shifting technology, a new immersive sound system, and a second generation of its steer-by-wire system.

Lexus touts a fully redesigned battery-electric vehicle system, which is underpinned by a larger battery. This refreshed RZ packs a 76.96-kWh battery pack, which is up from the 71.4-kWh battery that currently powers the RZ.

Electricity from that battery feeds a single electric motor at the front of the RZ 350e that’s good for 221 hp. That’s a 20-hp bump over the current entry point into the RZ lineup in the US, the RZ 300e.

The all-wheel-drive, two-motor RZ 500e uses the same battery pack as the RZ 350e but uses its two electric drive modules to make 375 hp.

Lexus

That’s a 67-hp bump over the current RZ 450e. The refresh also adds a more powerful model under the RZ 550e F Sport guise that makes a cool 402 hp.

Of course, these are European specs. Lexus has confirmed that US information will be confirmed at a later date, but there shouldn’t be a huge shift in power as it transitions stateside.

Alongside the extra power, Lexus is adding what it calls Manual Drive. This system essentially gives the drier a simulated shift, which works with a sound enhancement system.

This isn’t the first time an automaker has done something like this, but it is a first for Lexus. It wouldn’t be a huge surprise if systems like this become more common on performance-oriented BEVs going forward.

The updated RZ will also roll out the next generation of the company’s steer-by-wire system.



While the RZ was scheduled to launch with the steer-by-wire system, it seems like the system is finally ready for primetime.

Hearst Owned

Lexus says the updated RZ is scheduled to gradually start rolling out this fall. Lexus hasn’t mentioned what region it plans to launch this updated RZ first.

With updates, you can expect a price increase, which could mean the current $43,975 starting price would go by the wayside.

Porsche says the new model would feature both gasoline-only and hybrid powertrains.

It won't be here anytime soon, though, as the automaker says it could launch closer to 2030.

Porsche says its lineup could expand to include another SUV by the end of the decade. And no, it's not the Cayenne EV slated to launch later this year. Heck, it won't even be an EV. Surprisingly, for something that hasn't even been officially announced yet, Porsche says this mysterious new model would feature gasoline-only and hybrid powertrains but not an electric one.

The news was revealed as part of Porsche's annual financial outlook meeting, where the automaker hinted that it's considering a new SUV. ""... the sports-car manufacturer is currently evaluating an independent model line in the SUV segment with combustion and hybrid powertrains,"" Porsche said in a release.

Porsche

When, or if, the new model arrives, Porsche's lineup will include an electric-only Macan; options for pure-combustion, hybrid, and battery-electric Cayennes; and combustion and hybrid options for the new model.

Unfortunately, the company didn't feel the need to tell us how large the new SUV will be. It could be the three-row K1 model that Porsche announced in 2022, or it could be a different model entirely. It'll likely be a while before we learn anything concrete about the potential new SUV. According to Porsche, if it does decide to bring the new model to market, it won't do so until closer to 2030.

https://finance.yahoo.com,Updated Lexus RZ Finally Adds A Yoke And Simulated Shifts In Europe,https://autos.yahoo.com/updated-lexus-rz-finally-adds-214350243.html,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 21:43:50 GMT","Lexus Europe announced the updated Lexus RZ lineup today, with a host of improvements over the existing model including a new higher-powered RZ 550e F Sport that has Interactive Manual Drive, a feature that offers ""manual-like control of drive force."" Other platform updates result in shorter charging times, increased driving range, and as Lexus claims, ""a completely new driving experience"" courtesy of a new Steer-By-Wire System on the F Sport model that also turns the regular steering wheel into a yoke. We weren't big fans of the RZ's yoke when we originally drove it back in 2023, but maybe this final production version will be better?

Lexus' parent company Toyota was the trailblazer in the gasoline-electric hybrid vehicle revolution, with its first-generation Toyota Prius being the world's first mass produced hybrid vehicle, but the brand's first wave of real production EVs has been less revolutionary. The platform that underpins the Toyota bZ4X and Lexus RZ, and through a partnership with Subaru, the Solterra, has faced criticism since its introduction for its low range, uninspiring performance, and slow charging speeds that make it significantly less compelling than most other EVs on the market. Toyota also released an updated version of the bZ4X that has many of the same enhancements as the RZ, so the Subaru version should follow close behind.

Battery And Motor Updates Should Make It A Better Option

The dash of the new RZ550e with its yoke - Lexus

Lexus gave the RZ a new water-cooled battery with more battery cells that are more advanced than before, as well as a new, more efficient eAxle and drive motors with optimized control systems to increase performance, range, and charge speeds. Lexus claims that the range on all-wheel-drive RZ models increases by about 14 percent, and front-wheel-drive models see a 20-percent boost in range estimates. These are prototype values on the European WLTP range measurement cycle, which generally rates EVs with longer ranges than America's generally more conservative EPA range estimates. On the European WLTP cycle, Lexus estimates the single-motor front-wheel-drive RZ 350e will return a 357-mile range, the all-wheel-drive RZ 500e will do approximately 311 miles, and the new RZ 550e F Sport will cover 280 miles.

Advertisement Advertisement

The RZ's uncompetitive charging speeds will see much-needed improvements from these updates as well. Lexus claims a new onboard charger and battery structure reduce charge times by 30 minutes. Car and Driver recorded an 86-minute 10-to-90 percent charge time on a 2023 Lexus RZ, so the updates might drop that extortionately long time to a slightly more palatable 56 minutes. For reference, Car and Driver put a 2023 Genesis GV70 Electrified to the same test and it took just 24 minutes to go from a 10-to-90 percent charge, and an Audi Q4 E-Tron took 36 minutes.

The new eAxle's electric motor now produces 221 horsepower, which front-wheel-drive RZs will have that as their total power output, while, at least in the European market, there will be four different power outputs for all-wheel-drive models: 308 horsepower, 335 horsepower, 375 horsepower, and 402 horsepower for the new F Sport model. Currently, the most powerful RZ in the U.S. has only 308 hp. Five different power outputs seems like overkill, but maybe Lexus buyers are very particular about how much power they want?

F Sport Models Come With Simulated Manual Shifts And A Yoke

A close-up of the yoke showing how its shifted - Lexus

The new RZ 550e F Sport gets the most updates of the RZ line, with a yoke that controls a new steer-by-wire system, and Interactive Manual Drive that simulates paddle shifting through an eight-speed automatic transmission. The yoke was shown on early RZ concepts and prototypes, but hadn't made it to production yet. That changes with the new F Sport, in Europe at least. Lexus' steer-by-wire system will compensate for vehicle speed and steering inputs to account for low-speed maneuverability and stable reactions at higher speeds. Lexus says the system will only turn about 200 degrees from the neutral position, so it sounds like, similar to the Tesla Cybertruck's steer-by-wire system, no hand-over-hand turns will be necessary.

Judging from the photos in the press kit, the manual shifting situation will use paddles behind the grips of the yoke to shuffle through eight virtual gears with ""engine-like sounds"" that deliver auditory sensations reminiscent of an ICE vehicle. Lexus says ""drivetrain output is determined by combining the virtual power source torque, calculated based on throttle input and vehicle speed, with the gear ratio selected via the paddle shifters."" It also says a shift guide meter will provide visual feedback upon up and downshifts to track gear changes. European market RZ 550e F Sport models are estimated to go from 0 to 62 mph in 4.4 seconds.

The F Sport trim gets some suspension and exterior aerodynamic tweaks including front bumper molding, brake cooling ducts, a rear spoiler, and 20-inch wheels with aero covers. Neutrino Gray is a new F Sport–exclusive body color, and the bi-color choices remain. The F Sport also gets an exclusive ""Black x Dk. Gray"" interior that looks like every other black and gray interior, but features blue stitching on some accents.

It's A Better EV, But Still Not Likely To Stack Up Well Against Its Competitors

A rose gold Lexus RZ350e - Lexus

Lexus increased sound insulation for the car, including a rear floor silencer, increased soundproofing on the doors, and a sound-absorbing tonneau cover. The platform's rigidity is increased, the all-wheel-drive system is enhanced, and the suspension is retuned to enhance handling and ride comfort. Charge speeds, range, and performance are all improved, so it's definitely a better RZ, but that's not saying much. The RZ's biggest challenges come from its still-slow charge speeds and a stiff set of competition from brands like Mercedes-Benz, Genesis, Porsche, Polestar, Volvo, and Audi.

Is it going to be enough to convince more folks to buy or lease a Lexus RZ? Strictly gauging by the updated specs, the car still trails its competition in the packed luxury compact EV SUV segment. Keep in mind that these are all specifications for European models, as Lexus hasn't announced what changes will be coming to the U.S.-market RZ.

Explore ten eerie tales of haunted cars and cursed roads, where ghostly encounters turn driving into a spine-chilling experience.

The open road has always been a place of freedom and adventure, but not all journeys end peacefully. For decades, drivers have reported eerie encounters with phantom cars, ghostly passengers, and haunted highways. Whether they are urban legends or spine-chilling realities, these tales of haunted cars and cursed roads offer a glimpse into the mysterious and unexplained.

1. The Phantom Hitchhiker of Route 66

The phantom hitchhiker of Route 66 is a well-known ghost story. Drivers report picking up a woman in white who mysteriously vanishes as they near her destination—a cemetery. Some say she resembles a young girl who tragically died on that stretch of road, leaving many to wonder if her spirit still seeks a ride home.

2. James Dean’s Cursed Porsche: “Little Bastard”

James Dean’s Porsche 550 Spyder, known as “Little Bastard,” has become infamous for its curse. After Dean’s fatal crash in the car, its parts were reused in other vehicles—all of which were involved in accidents. The wreck of “Little Bastard” vanished during transportation in the 1960s, adding to its eerie legend.

3. The Ghost Camaro of High Point, North Carolina

In the 1970s, a young man named Eddie died driving his black Camaro in North Carolina. To this day, drivers report seeing a ghostly black Camaro speeding along highways. The car’s headlights appear in rearview mirrors, only to vanish when pursued, leaving many convinced that Eddie’s spirit is still out there.

4. Clinton Road: America’s Most Haunted Highway

Clinton Road in New Jersey is notorious for supernatural occurrences. Drivers report seeing ghostly figures and being followed by a phantom truck. One legend involves a boy’s ghost returning coins tossed into a bridge’s water, adding to the road’s haunted reputation.

5. The Haunted Car of Rose Hill Cemetery

In Chicago’s Rose Hill Cemetery, a mysterious black car is said to circle the grounds at night. Some believe it’s driven by a long-dead caretaker, still watching over the cemetery. Witnesses report the headlights vanishing upon approach, leaving behind only the unsettling presence of the phantom vehicle.

6. The Curse of the Golden Eagle

The 1964 Dodge 330, known as the “Golden Eagle,” is believed to be cursed. Originally a police car, it was linked to a series of tragic deaths among officers who drove it. Later, private owners experienced strange accidents and misfortune, leading to the car’s sinister reputation as “America’s most evil car.”

7. Resurrection Mary of Archer Avenue

Resurrection Mary is Chicago’s most famous ghost. Many drivers have reported picking up a young woman in white along Archer Avenue, only for her to disappear near Resurrection Cemetery. Mary’s spirit is said to haunt the road, reliving the tragic accident that took her life decades ago.

8. The Ghost Car of Belchen Tunnel, Switzerland

In Switzerland’s Belchen Tunnel, drivers report encounters with a ghostly old woman who mysteriously appears inside their vehicles. She often warns drivers of impending danger before vanishing. Some believe she is a protective spirit, guiding drivers away from accidents.

9. The Black Volga: Eastern Europe’s Sinister Legend

During the Cold War, tales of a cursed black Volga limousine spread throughout Eastern Europe. Legend has it that the car was linked to disappearances and mysterious deaths. Though widely regarded as a myth, the Black Volga still evokes fear among those who hear the story.

10. The Haunted Hearse of Tennessee

On rural roads in Tennessee, witnesses have reported seeing a phantom hearse speeding with no driver in sight. The ghostly vehicle is said to appear at accident sites or chase other drivers before vanishing without a trace. This eerie hearse has become a symbol of death on lonely backroads.

These stories blur the line between folklore and reality, offering a glimpse into the supernatural mysteries that continue to haunt the roads. Whether or not you believe in ghosts, the next time you’re driving at night, keep your eyes on the road—and your rearview mirror.

Descended from the legendary big block 454, an engine that has powered countless muscle cars and hot rods throughout the decades, it debuted in 2001 as the Silverado 3500's power plant. It was both an answer to the competition's huge truck mills — the massive, powerful V10s offered by cross-town rivals Ford and Dodge — and a cheaper alternative to the big, expensive Duramax diesels GM offered at the time.

Produced at the Tonawanda engine plant in Buffalo, NY, with blocks cast at Saginaw Metal Casting Operations, the 8100 displaced 496 cubic inches, had a four-and-a-quarter bore, and 4.37-inch stroke. In stock trim, it produced 340 horsepower and 455 pound-feet of torque — most of it between 1200 and 4000 RPM. This was within spitting distance of the Duramax's output and was extremely competitive with Ford and Dodge's big V10s. With all that torque on tap, and with it coming on so soon, the 8100 made for an excellent towing and hauling engine.

Throughout nearly a decade of production, the 8100 powered everything from pick-ups to boats to U-Haul trucks. Workhorse, now a Navistar joint, used the engine to power a line of motorhomes and throughout the aughts. At that time, it was one of the most popular gas-powered engines for class A motorhomes. It was even used to power a Russian-built, GM-based armored vehicle called the T-98 Kombat.

By the mid-aughts, it was already clear that the big block era was coming to a close. Increases in gas and diesel engine technology combined with the Vortec 8100's single-digit fuel economy made it increasingly more difficult for The General to justify its production. The 6.0-liter LS V8 offered up to 360 horsepower and 380 foot-pounds of torque with better fuel economy. On the diesel side, GM was switching over to turbodiesel mills for its towing and commercial rigs. The new (at the time) Duramax was pumping out 650 foot-pounds of torque, nearly half as much as the 8100, and it was doing it cleaner and more efficient.

GM axed the 8100 for use in its pick-ups and SUVs, as well as the Avalanche after the 2007 model year. The big V8 soldiered on in the Kodiak/TopKick trucks for a little while longer, but it just didn't make financial sense to keep the 8100 around anymore, legacy or not. The last Vortec 8100 was produced in late 2009, and that closed the book on GM's legendary big block V8 era.

Hamilton worked with Dawn Apollo Films, Large Eyes, and Paramount Pictures to fully insert himself as the joyriding parking lot valet drifting and jumping Cameron's father's 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California Spyder around the streets of Chicago. Only 56 examples of that car were ever made, and thankfully for car enthusiasts everywhere, the one they destroyed for the film was actually a Ford 302-powered fiberglass replica, not the 8-figure alloy original. Hamilton said he ""had to get the exact car"" for this scene remake, so perhaps this is also a replica and not a Ferrari at all? In any case, as a fan of the film myself, I'm impressed.

The shot-for-shot remake of the fully restored scene inserted Hamilton as the mildly shady valet that Bueller pays off with a fiver to take extra good care of the delightful Ferrari. In the original sequence the driver is played by Richard Edson and his co-pilot is Larry Flash Jenkins, but in this revamped edition Edson's stand-in is Hamilton, while Jenkins is re-cast as legendary Hollywood master Edward Norton. Norton has been confused for Matthew Broderick's ""Bueller"" co-star Alan Ruck for decades, so this was probably a bit cathartic for Norton.

A Dream Come True

Lewis posted that the film (which you can find here) ""has been one of my favourite movies since I was a kid,"" and ends the short nearly three-minute clip with an inspirational dedication quote credited to himself: ""For all the kids out there who dream the impossible."" Most young drivers who dream of making it to Formula One will never get there, and many young drivers who actually do dream of one day driving for Ferrari and never do. For Lewis, this has been a decades-long journey to get to the top of the sport and earn his way into the Scuderia. He calls the short film ""Another dream come true ..."" on YouTube, indicating that driving for the team has perhaps been a dream as long as he's loved watching the Ferrari in ""Ferris Bueller."" Andiamo, Lewis, Forza Ferrari.

https://finance.yahoo.com,Christopher Bell Can Join Elite NASCAR Club with Win at Las Vegas,https://autos.yahoo.com/christopher-bell-join-elite-nascar-203800581.html,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 20:38:00 GMT","Only eight drivers in NASCAR’s “modern era” since 1972 have won four consecutive races.

And of those eight, five have gone on to win the NASCAR Cup title.

Christopher Bell is going for No. 4 on Sunday at Las Vegas—a track at which he's yet to win in 10 starts.

The folks in Norman, Oklahoma might want to hold up on that parade honoring one of their own Christopher Bell as NASCAR’s 2025 Cup Series champion. And maybe Joe Gibbs Racing shouldn’t be finding room for another Owner’s Championship trophy.

On the other hand, maybe they should just go ahead with their plans.

We’re four weekends into the 36-race season and Bell, an Oklahoma native and JGR star, is the talk of the sport. He’s won the last three races in dramatic fashion, leading only the last lap near Atlanta last month, then by a combined 0.923 seconds at COTA and Phoenix.

It’s understandable that sites are using “click-bait” to tout Bell. Some are asking, “Can anyone stop the unstoppable Bell?” or “Will Bell make it four straight?” or “Will Christopher ring the bell again?”

We’ll find out on Sunday as he tries for a fourth consecutive Cup victory, this one the Pennzoil 400 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. He’s yet to win there in 10 starts, but has two second-place finishes, another top-5, and two other top-10s. He dominated last fall, leading more than half the laps before finishing behind Joey Logano. His other runner-up came behind Kyle Larson in the fall of 2023.

Modern Era Four-Peats

Some history about “four-peat” drivers:

Only eight in NASCAR’s “modern era” since 1972 have done that: Cale Yarborough in 1976, Darrell Waltrip in 1981, Dale Earnhardt in 1987, Harry Gant in 1991, Bill Elliott in 1992, Mark Martin in 1993, Jeff Gordon in 1998, and Jimmie Johnson in 2007.

Five out of that group—Yarborough, Waltrip, Earnhardt, Gordon, and Johnson—won the championship those seasons. As for the other three: Gant finished fourth in the ’91 standings, Elliott was second in ’92, and Martin was third in ’93.

The all-time record is 10 straight wins by Richard Petty in 1967, a streak that will outlive all of us.

Bell is the latest to win three straight since Kyle Larson did it twice in winning the 2021 championship. Among the notables whose winning streak was stopped at three: former champions Kurt Busch, Tony Stewart, Martin Truex, Jr., Benny Parsons, Matt Kenseth, Dale Jarrett, Alan Kulwicki, and both of the Labonte brothers.

But wait … there’s more: Hall of Famer driver and former champion Bobby Allison never got to four straight in the modern era. Neither did fellow HOF and championship drivers Petty, David Pearson, and Rusty Wallace. Future Hall of Famer and two-time champion Kevin Harvick didn’t do it, and neither did active past champions Chase Elliott, Brad Keselowski, Kyle Busch, and Joey Logano.

Matt Sullivan - Getty Images

Been There, Done That

Bell’s crew chief is Adam Stevens, who helped Kyle Busch win three straight during his 2015 championship run. “I’ll never forget 2021, my first year with Adam,” Bell said after the Phoenix victory. “Kyle Larson won three straight (twice, in fact, plus the championship), but me and Adam got off to a rocky patch, a rocky start.

“We’re sitting in his office at JGR and he looked at me and said, ‘We can do this.’ He said, ‘I've won three straight sitting in these exact same two chairs,’ talking about him and Kyle Busch. ‘I know we can do it.’ It took a while to get here, but we finally did (because) Adam knew what was capable of this team and we’re finally starting to see the fruit of it.”

True enough. But it’s much too early to be planning parades and finding trophy space. Let’s give it some time.",yahoo

Paint Color,https://autos.yahoo.com/2025-jeep-wrangler-gladiator-eye-203300345.html,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 20:33:00 GMT","After disappearing from the Jeep Wrangler's color options in 2020, Mojito! returns for 2025 and is offered on the Jeep Gladiator for the first time.

The lime-green hue is the second new color to join the Wrangler and Gladiator lineup for 2025, alongside the military olive-drab-inspired '41 color.

The Mojito! paint option costs $595 and is available now.

If you're going to get a vehicle with a removable roof and doors, you might as well choose a color that matches that unruly energy. While most of the color options for the 2025 Jeep Wrangler and Gladiator are subdued (outside of Firecracker Red), Jeep now offers a striking lime-green Mojito! exterior color for both models, adding some serious flair.

Jeep

Mojito isn't a hue for fitting in. In Jeep's press images, the color is so vibrant that it looks like it's glowing in the dark while the sun is still out—which is undeniably part of its appeal. Mojito also isn't a new color option for Jeep; it was initially offered on the Wrangler in 2018 before being discontinued in 2020. It is, however, new to the brand's mid-size pickup truck, the Gladiator. It's also the second new green exterior paint option to be offered on both models for 2025, with the other being a military olive-drab-inspired '41 color introduced on the Wrangler 4xe Willys '41.

Jeep

The two shockingly different shades of green each cost $595 and are now available on all Wrangler and Gladiator trims. Pricing for the 2025 Wrangler starts at $33,990, and the base Gladiator pickup costs $39,995. While vivid green paint might not be for everybody, Mojito and Jeeps go together like mint and lime.

It brings new looks, new tech and even a dash of carbon fiber to the historic brand. But don't worry, at its heart, the car is still distinctly Morgan, with an ash wood frame that the brand says is around 10 percent stiffer than the Plus Six, which the Supersport replaces at the top of Morgan's lineup.

A Morgan For The Modern Age

The wooden frame forms the basis of the car, and new aluminum bodywork is strapped to its exterior. The bodywork looks great, and is unmistakably Morgan. It's got the same bulbous front end and long, swooping side skirts, but everything is renewed with a modern, minimalist flair. I really dig it, especially the rear end which now houses an actual functioning trunk!

Other modern flourishes on the new car include LED headlamps up front and a removable roof constructed from carbon composites, and there's even wireless phone charging in the center console. Morgan, what happened to you?

Modern, But Not Too Modern

A photo of the interior of a Morgan Supersport car in blue. - Morgan

At this point, you might expect me to drop the bombshell that this all-new, all-modern Morgan is the company's first electric vehicle. Well, it isn't. Instead, the Supersport retains the gas power of old with a BMW-sourced inline-six sitting at its heart. The turbocharged motor produces 330 horsepower and 369 pound-feet of torque, which is enough to get this lightweight sports car from 0 to 62 mph in 3.9 seconds and on to a top speed of 166 mph.

Power is routed to the wheels via an eight-speed ZF automatic gearbox, with no option for a manual, and a new steering system is said to offer ""enhanced feedback and response,"" Morgan adds. There's also a new suspension system with front and rear anti-roll bars to improve handling.

The First Morgan You Could Live With

A photo of a Morgan Supersport car in blue. - Morgan

As well as making a lovely-looking Morgan, these updates have all been made with the aim of making the Supersport a Morgan that you could actually live with. It's for this reason that the trunk space was added and a new audio system installed that Morgan says can hear your screams over the rushing wind.

All this practicality will set you back around £85,000, which is equivalent to about $110,000 at today's rate. Sadly, while the Plus Four made a triumphant return to the U.S. last year, Car And Driver reports that Morgan doesn't plan to bring the Supersport Stateside at the moment.

So, if you need another reason to leave the country after everything that's going on right now, this could be the excuse that finally pushes you over the edge.

It has a unique background.

In a surprising discovery, an abandoned 1989 Chevrolet Cavalier has emerged from years of obscurity in a garage. This classic coupe, left untouched by its late owner, was recently found in near-original condition and briefly listed on eBay for an initial bid of $200. Though the listing has since been removed, this Cavalier’s story has captivated enthusiasts and project car seekers alike.

The car’s history is a mix of sentiment and mystery. The original owner, who cherished the Cavalier, stored it away after only a brief time on the road. Following the owner’s passing, the car remained hidden in storage, almost forgotten until its recent discovery. The seller, who stumbled upon the car, described the rescue as saving it ""from being left to die."" Despite decades in storage, the Cavalier retains all its original parts, a rare find for a classic car that has never served as a donor vehicle.

This 1989 Chevrolet Cavalier features a 3.1-liter engine, though it’s uncertain whether it runs after years in a dormant state. Classic cars often require a careful approach to restoration, with attention to cleaning, inspection, and part replacement. The first step for this Cavalier is a thorough wash, followed by a professional assessment to determine which components may need repairs or upgrades. Cars left in storage often face issues like stale fluids, dry seals, and potential corrosion, but this Cavalier’s preserved condition offers hope for a smooth revival.

Project cars like this Cavalier occasionally surface online, giving enthusiasts a chance to own a classic piece of automotive history at a reasonable price. While this particular listing has disappeared from eBay, it serves as a reminder to keep an eye out for hidden gems that emerge unexpectedly, ready to be restored and appreciated once again. For anyone seeking an affordable classic car with a story, keeping tabs on the market could lead to finding a treasure like this 1989 Cavalier.

It has also become one of the great car movies of all time, thanks to the prominent role an iconic replica of an iconic Ferrari plays in the story. Lewis Hamilton, who will be driving a very real Ferrari in Formula 1 this year, loves it too. Since he is Lewis Hamilton and has the ability to do so, he decided to celebrate that love by having himself edited into the movie.

In the clip, Hamilton replaces a parking garage attendant originally played by Richard Edson. Just as in the original movie, he accepts a $5 bill from Matthew Broderick's Ferris Bueller to take good care of the Ferrari that belongs to the father of Alan Ruck's character, Cameron Frye. After attempting some questionable accent work, Hamilton drives away in the car and goes on a joyride. Fight Club star Edward Norton makes a cameo in the clip as the other garage attendant, who rides along for the adventure in the original film.

Hamilton says in an Instagram caption that the clip took ""a lot of cutting edge tech, production and planning to get right."" He also adds that he needed ""the exact car,"" although it is unclear from his post if that car was a replica like the one originally used in the film or an actual Ferrari 250 GT California.

Lewis Hamilton's debut in a Ferrari Formula 1 car is set for this weekend at the Australian Grand Prix. The seven-time champion, 105-time race winner, and 104-time polesitter will be hoping to extend all three of those all-time records in his first season with the Scuderia.

Left For Dead: Barn Find Volkswagen Thing Gets Fully Detailed

Someone drove a Volkswagen Thing into a barn 50 years ago, parking the German contraption. Little did they realize at the time it would sit for half a century before getting pulled out and detailed by some YouTubers.

A one-of-two Tesla is for sale online now.

Despite being dirty, this Thing is wonderfully well preserved. With about 6,800 miles on it, there’s no wonder the VW doesn’t look too shabby. According to the owner, it could possibly have been the first one imported into the US.

Under all the barn dust is a beautiful example of the VW Thing. But the worst part of the classic German vehicle by far were the wheels, which had quite a bit of surface rust. You perhaps have owned a car with wheels that looked similar and just accepted their corroded state.

But the guys at WD Detailing take pride in their ability to clean up cars and make them look fantastic. They use their own wheel cleaner and it does a great job of removing most of the grime and some corrosion sitting on the metal. But you’ll notice the rust is still present to a degree.

The rest of the classic Volkswagen cleans up nicely, including the engine compartment in the rear.

Also known as the Type 181, the Thing was created by Volkswagen as a cheap and different open-air adventure vehicle. You can remove the roof and doors, plus fold down the windshield, similar to a Jeep, getting a fully open air driving experience. Just don’t expect to do any serious off-roading in one.

With the same platform as the Beetle, only widened and a few things rearranged, the Thing was a super yet fun way to get around. But the classic rides haven’t become serious collector items, fetching rather modest amounts on the market these days.

There's only six of them at this mall, and luckily I was able to get a spot at one. As I walked toward the garage exit I passed by a section with Tesla chargers that is used by the Tesla showroom at the mall, and I spotted a pair of face-lifted Model Ys, the first ones I've seen in person.

Y'all, it looks like dog dookie. While the Model 3 facelift looks nice though not any fresher or better than the old one did, the Model Y's updates are a downgrade from an already ugly SUV. But the new Model Y being ugly as hell isn't even in the top three of reasons why you shouldn't buy one, and depending on how the rest of this week goes the Y's ugliness could slide even further down the list.

It Really Is Ugly, Though

Rear 3/4 view of a new Tesla Model Y - Daniel Golson / Jalopnik

The Model Y is an old car, having been revealed in 2019 as a bloated crossover version of the Model 3 that was introduced two years earlier. For this 2025 model year update Tesla redesigned the front and rear clips, made some pretty minor changes to the interior, and that's about it. None of it looks good, or even any more modern than the old Model Y. Slim headlights connected by a central lightbar are supposed to evoke the Cybertruck, but it just makes the front end look way more generic and droopy. The actual headlights are now the units mounted below that come off the air intakes.

Daniel Golson / Jalopnik

I will give credit to Tesla's design team for the technology behind the Model Y's seemingly hidden light bar, which has an ""indirect reflective body panel"" that makes a glowing central lightbar appear when the car is on, but in execution (especially when parked and turned off) I think it looks bad. The license plate getting moved down into the lower bumper emphasizes the Model Y's height and width in a negative way, too, and the tailgate now has an extra panel gap that also looks bad. And you're stuck with the Model Y's same horrible greenhouse and overall proportions. While the interior has slightly more interesting door panels, allegedly better materials and singular strips of ambient lighting, it's just as bleak and design-less as before. Truly depressing.

Full Self-Driving Could Kill You

Interior of a new Tesla Model Y - Daniel Golson / Jalopnik

A bigger reason to not get a new Tesla is how dangerous they are. Not in terms of actual crash-test safety — to Teslas credit, the cars are very safe in that regard — but because of Tesla's ""Autopilot"" and ""Full Self-Driving"" technologies. While these features are just Level 2 automated driver-assist systems like the highway assist systems offered by countless other automakers, Tesla recklessly allows owners to use them on all sorts of roads, and hands-free at that. Tesla essentially uses its owners as beta testers for the driver-assist features. It's a blatant disregard for established safety protocols, and because of Tesla's branding of the systems, the owners misuse them as well, assuming that the driver doesn't need to still pay full attention to the road and maintain control of the vehicle. One research company found that drivers had to take control of Teslas using FSD every 13 miles.

Advertisement Advertisement

There are countless examples of Teslas crashing or getting into dangerous situations while ""Autopilot"" or ""Full Self-Driving"" is engaged, too often resulting in occupant death. One Cybertruck smashed into a pole, while another suddenly accelerated and crashed into a railing. The systems don't work in Teslas own tunnels, they don't understand New York City, Teslas using FSD have driven into curbs, driven onto train tracks, and killed deer, motorcyclists and pedestrians. FSD computers have been bricking cars, and Musk has even admitted that Teslas can't physically ""self drive"" without a hardware upgrade. I don't know about you, but I'm not gonna trust Tesla's driver-assist systems, especially given how all the new cars are camera-based, eschewing radar and other sensors used by every other automaker.

If you really want to go hands-free while on the freeway, you can find systems in all sorts of BMWs, Fords, General Motors products, Toyotas and Lexuses, Stellantis products, Nissans and Infinitis, and more to come. Currently, Mercedes-Benz is the only company offering a Level 3 system in the U.S., which allows the driver to take their hands off the wheel and their eyes off the road, all with full governmental approval and proper safety testing.

Don't Support Elon Musk

Advertisement Advertisement

I can't believe I have to keep saying this, but there are new reasons to bring it back up every day: Don't support Elon Musk. It's well past the time where you should have stopped buying new Teslas or even considered them, but in case you're still on the fence for some reason, every day is a good day to stop supporting Elon Musk. From making Nazi salutes and promoting modern fascism to actively destroying the U.S. government and the civil rights of our most vulnerable people (specifically and most importantly trans people, of whom he is the father of one), Musk is doing a lot of truly despicable sh*t these days. He's already the richest man in the world, he doesn't need your money. Let him waste the rest of his fortune on rockets that will explode.

Boycotts and protests of Musk and his company at Tesla stores are clearly working, as the company's stock is tanking and sales have cratered around the world. It's all obviously getting under his skin, too. Today Musk showed up to the White House to throw a blatant PR event for Tesla, where Donald Trump ""bought"" Teslas for himself and his granddaughter, bloviating about how ""good"" the cars are and how unfair it is that Musk is being targeted. On the heels of calling boycotts of Tesla ""illegal,"" Trump announced that people who vandalize Tesla stores will be tried as domestic terrorists, which is a super cool and fun new development. Musk is so intertwined in our government and with Trump, supporting one goes hand-in-hand with the other, and that should be a horrible, embarrassing thought either way. These guys are just so freakin' gross! Don't even consider it.

There Are So Many Better Alternatives

Front 3/4 view of a teal Hyundai Ioniq 5 - Hyundai

If somehow all of that still isn't enough to convince you, just know that there are so many better electric vehicle alternatives out there, the purchase of none of which will fund a baby-obsessed freak's ketamine addiction. Without factoring in the federal incentives that Trump is trying to get rid of, the new Model Y starts at $59,990 for the Launch Series long range dual-motor version, which is the only kind of Model Y facelift currently available to order. (A pre-facelift rear-wheel-drive Model Y costs $44,990; add $3,000 for AWD and $8,000 for FSD, which is standard on the new Launch model.) A 327-mile range and 4.1-second 0-to-60-mph time for the new Model Y is good, sure, but no longer class-leading or impressive. The Model Y's charging speeds also aren't as good as other EVs with 800-volt architecture.

I could list a lot of similarly priced or segmented EVs that I'd rather have than a Model Y, and I will: Chevrolet Equinox EV, Kia EV6, Polestar 2, Ford Mustang Mach-E, Mercedes-Benz EQB, Cadillac Lyriq, Volvo EX40. I could go on. There are also a bunch of electric cars on sale that might have less range and fewer features than the Tesla, and that might not be fantastic cars in general, but I would still rather drive than a Model Y. I don't really want to drive a Toyota BZ4X, but at least it's not a Tesla. And there are more great new EVs coming out all the time, across various segments and price points.

Advertisement Advertisement

Really, there is one EV that should put the nail in the coffin to any Model Y considerations: the Hyundai Ioniq 5. Newly face-lifted for 2025, the Ioniq 5 is quicker, more efficient, has a longer range, more features, better technology and even better styling than before. It's vastly nicer to look at and be in than the Model Y. Plus, it now has the Tesla-style NACS port, so you have access to the Tesla Supercharger network for easier road tripping. While spending money to charge at Tesla stations is still putting money into Musk's pocket, and you won't get the Ioniq 5's max charge speeds at a Tesla charger anyway, I do support owners of non-Tesla EVs hogging all of the spots at Tesla stations. The Ioniq 5 is now built in the U.S., too, so you're supporting American manufacturing. Just don't buy the damn Model Y.

It’s time to clean house, consolidate any UTXOs you need to, open or close any Lightning channels you’ve been waiting on, and inscribe some stupid 8-bit jpeg into the blockchain. They’re perceived as a positive time.

They are not. We have seen explosive price appreciation the last few months, finally hitting the 100k USD benchmark that everyone took for granted as preordained during the last market cycle. That’s not normal.

The picture on the left is the average feerate each day since 2017, the picture on the right is the average price each day since 2017. When the price was pumping, when it was highly volatile, historically we have seen feerates spike accordingly. Generally matching the growth and peaking when the price did. The people actually buying and selling transacted on-chain, people took custody of their own coins when they bought them.

This last leg up to over 100k does not seem at all to have had the same proportional affect on feerates that even moves earlier in this cycle have. Now, if you actually did look at both of those charts, I’m sure many people are going “What if this cycle is at the end?” It’s possible, but let’s say it’s not for a second.

What else could this be indicating? That the participants that are driving the market are changing. A group of people who used to be dominated by individuals who self custodied, who managed their counterparty risk by removing gains from exchanges, who generated time-sensitive on-chain activity, are transforming into a group of people simply passing around ETF shares that have no need of settling anything on-chain.

That is not a good thing. Bitcoin’s very nature is defined by the users who interact with the protocol directly. Those who have private keys to authorize transactions generating revenue for miners. Those who are sent funds, and verify transactions against consensus rules with software.

Both of those things being removed from the hands of users and placed behind the veil of custodians puts the very stability of Bitcoin’s nature at risk.

This is a serious existential issue that has to be solved. The entire stability of consensus around a specific set of rules is premised on the assumption that there are enough independent actors with separate interests that diverge, but align on a value gained from using that set of rules. The smaller the group of independent actors (and the larger the group of people “using” Bitcoin through those actors as intermediaries) the more practical it is for them to coordinate to fundamentally change them, and the more likely it is that their interests as a group will diverge in sync from the interests of the larger group of secondary users.

If things continue trending in that direction, Bitcoin very well could end up embodying nothing that those of us here today hope it can. This problem is both a technical one, in terms of scaling Bitcoin in a way that allows users to independently have control of their funds on-chain, even if only through worst-case recourse, but it is also a problem of incentive and risk management.

The system must not only scale, but it has to be able to provide ways to mitigate the risks of self custody to the degree that people are used to from the traditional financial world. Many of them actually need it.

This isn’t just a situation of “do the same thing I do because it’s the only correct way,” this is something that has implications for the foundational properties of Bitcoin itself in the long term.

The announcement follows Rumble’s previously disclosed corporate treasury diversification strategy, which was approved by its Board of Directors. The strategy aims to leverage Bitcoin as a strategic asset to accelerate the company’s expansion into digital assets while strengthening its financial position.

“We believe that the world is still in the early stages of the adoption of Bitcoin, which has recently accelerated with the election of a crypto-friendly U.S. presidential administration and increased institutional adoption,” Pavlovski stated. “Unlike any government-issued currency, Bitcoin is not subject to dilution through endless money-printing, enabling it to be a valuable inflation hedge and an excellent addition to our treasury. We are also excited to strengthen our ties with crypto and to bolster our efforts to become the leading video and cloud services platform for the crypto community.”

The company noted that the actual timing and value of any future Bitcoin acquisitions will depend on various factors, including general market conditions, Bitcoin’s trading price, and Rumble’s anticipated cash needs. Rumble stated their strategy will remain flexible and may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time based on the company’s discretion.",bitcoinmagazine
https://bitcoinmagazine.com,Debifi Is The Premier Noncustodial P2P Bitcoin-Backed Lending Platform For Institutions,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/debifi-is-the-premier-noncustodial-p2p-bitcoin-backed-lending-platform-for-institutions,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 08:15:53 GMT","Founder: Max Kei (CEO)

Date Founded: March 2024

Location of Headquarters: Lugano, Switzerland

Website: https://debifi.com/

Public or Private? Private

Max Kei is a builder in the Bitcoin P2P space as well as a seasoned banker, which makes him uniquely qualified to create Debifi, a noncustodial, bitcoin-backed P2P lending platform that primarily serves institutions.

Kei’s work in the Bitcoin space began in 2017, when he first contributing to Hodl Hodl, which quickly became a widely used noncustodial P2P trading platform.

In 2020, he helped the exchange launch Lend at Hodl Hodl, the first noncustodial P2P borrowing and lending product in the Bitcoin space.

The product gained traction in Latin America and Southeast Asia, where it was used to facilitate microloans, while the likes of Preston Pysh (now Strategic Advisor to Debifi) took interest in the product and renowned cypherpunk Adam Back also sang its praises.

According to Kei, it’s the high-quality reputation of the team behind Lend at Hodl Hodl, some of whom now work on Debifi, that’s attracting users to Debifi.

“A lot of lenders and borrowers go to Debifi because they know the team has very extensive experience,” Kei told Bitcoin Magazine.

“People are satisfied, as we’ve been through multiple bear cycles and managed to survive,” he added.

“Now, we’ve taken the concept of Lend at Hodl Hodl and moved into the institutional space.”

From Banker To Bitcoiner

For 10 years before finding Bitcoin, Kei worked as a private banker.

He resigned from his position before “going full Bitcoin rabbit hole” at the end of 2015, partially as a reaction to an experience he had with one of his clients.

“A year before I quit, I was sitting in a meeting in the bank office with one of my clients and he was showing me his phone and saying ‘You know at some point in the future, I’m not going to need you because I have bitcoin,’” recounted Kei.

The client then proceeded to send $15,000 worth of bitcoin to a contact of his in Brazil, according to Kei, who thought to himself that his client was insane. However, it didn’t take long for Kei to realize that his client wasn’t crazy but, instead, onto something.

“I started doing my own research, and I quickly realized that Bitcoin is a real thing,” said Kei.

Kei pivoted to Bitcoin soon after. However, after spending eight years building in the Bitcoin space, he’s come to believe that banks will still have a role in a hyperbitcoinized future.

“Banks aren’t going to go away,” explained Kei.

“They will become infrastructure providers for Bitcoin companies, for startups, for everyone. They’re still going to be a backbone,” he added.

He realized this when banks and other financial institutions began expressing interest in using the Lend at Hodl Hodl product.

Differentiating With Debifi

Within months of launching Lend at Hodl Hodl, institutions reached out to the Hodl Hodl team requesting to use the platform.

“They said ‘Hey, we want to be available for bitcoin lending,’” recalled Kei.

“But we didn’t want to mix the world of microlending with the world of institutional lending. We realized we needed to do something different. That’s how the concept of Debifi came into existence,” he added.

In 2022, Kei began brainstorming Debifi. A year later, they raised money from venture capital firms including Ten31 and Timechain to build a minimum viable product (MVP). By March 2024, Debifi was live.

The platform has been operating in beta, and the official version will go live at the end of the month. With that said, Kei explained that Debifi is fully functional already.

“Just because the product is in beta doesn’t mean that it’s not operational — it’s actually fully operational,” he said.

And so this brings us to the next question: How exactly does Debifi work?

How Debifi Works

Debifi is both a website and a mobile app, and the two work in tandem.

“We have a very unique value proposition is that the mobile app acts as a key storage,” said Kei. “The mobile app becomes a wallet, storing your private key, but you need to use the website in order to engage in contracts.”

When you sign a transaction, create an escrow for a loan, or pay off a loan, you use the mobile app to do so.

Users can also opt to use the COLDCARD devices (the Mk4 or the Q) in place of the mobile app, and Kei hopes to add support for other hardware wallets as well.

“We want to support Jade from Blockstream, Ledger devices, Trezor devices, the Foundation Passport, and BitBox — all these good names — because we want to provide flexibility for our customers,” explained Kei.

The collateral for Debifi loans is escrowed in a multisignature (multisig) wallet featuring four keys, three of which are needed to sign off on transactions.

“At Debifi, we have a unique multi-signature setup,” said Kei. “All loans are held in a 3-out-of-4 multsig wallet, while the standard is 2-out-of-3.”

The borrower, the lender and Debifi each hold one key, while the fourth is held by AnchorWatch. Kei claims that having a fourth key held by a trustworthy institution like AnchorWatch increases security dramatically.

“With two institutions holding keys, even if the lender’s and borrower’s keys are somehow compromised, you still need to get one more key,” said Kei. “If we remove AnchorWatch and go with a simple 2-out-of-3 model, then we might end up in a situation where attackers have two keys and the attacker doesn’t need a third key.”

Debifi loans are overcollateralized (forced liquidations occur if the value of the bitcoin collateral drops below a certain level, which varies based on the agreement between the borrower and lender) and the average APR is just above 10%.

Kei explained that his team’s research has shown that many are willing to pay the higher APR for noncustodial loans.

“A while back, we talked with 300 Bitcoiners and we gave them a very simple option: You can borrow custodially at an 8% interest rate or you can borrow noncustodially at 11% or 12% interest rate,” he explained. “91% of people said that they would prefer to hold their keys.”

Users can take out loans up to $1 million via the platform and the loan durations range from three to 12 months. As of April, this will expand to 24 months.

Users can borrow in U.S. dollar stablecoins, U.S. dollars, euros, and Swiss francs, and Debifi is working on adding British pounds, Brazilian reals, and Mexican pesos to that list.

Debifi monetizes through origination fees, which it takes from the collateral put in escrow, and it has a dispute resolution team that helps to resolve loan repayment issues and other problems.

What’s Next For Debifi

As mentioned, Debifi just brought on Preston Pysh as a strategic advisor in efforts to help the company with networking and publicity. Pysh will also provide advice on how to improve Debifi’s product.

The company also plans to partner with Blockstream’s Asset Management (BAM) division. BAM will utilize Debifi as a technical provider for institutions looking to offer bitcoin-backed lending products.

Beyond that, Kei noted that a number of other important partnerships are in the pipeline as well, and that Debifi will announce them in the coming months.

And he concluded with a pitch to all the institutions out there who might be interested in working with Debifi.

“Debifi helps you plug and play in the bitcoin-backed lending world as an institution,” said Kei.

“We provide you with all the necessary infrastructure. We’ll onboard you, and we’ll guide you with private support. We’ll give you all the necessary tools,” he added.

“Effectively, we’re going to be like a one-stop shop. Not only do you not have to build this stuff because it’s already there, we bring you the customers, which we allow you to communicate with directly. And the best part is that as a liquidity provider, you don’t pay us anything. Zero.”

It’s hard not to argue that Kei and his team are onto something here.",bitcoinmagazine

CalPERS oversees a massive $500 billion pension fund serving over 2 million public sector retirees. If elected, Bei would be the first openly pro-bitcoin voice on the 13-member board.

Bei is a 16-year veteran firefighter who founded Proof of Workforce, a nonprofit providing bitcoin education to workers, unions and pension funds. He previously served on Santa Monica’s pension advisory board and played a key role in the city’s firefighters union, becoming one of the first to hold bitcoin.

Through his outreach work, Bei has assisted multiple unions, associations and pensions in exploring and adopting bitcoin strategies. This includes spearheading education efforts for the Wisconsin Retirement System.

He stated, “Now more than ever, pension participants and stakeholders need to engage with with their pension funds. I am running for the CalPERS Board of Trustees with the goal of being a conduit for engagement and transparency, while advocating for the long term health and success of the nation’s largest pension fund.”

He received endorsements from a wide range of supporters including the California State Senator Ben Allen, Tony Vazquez of the California Board of Equalization, Santa Monica Mayor Lana Negrete, Vancouver Mayor Ken Sim, President of the Santa Monica Firefighters Local 1109 Garrett Childers and others. This diverse coalition demonstrates the broad appeal of Bei’s message and qualifications.

CalPERS faces growing headwinds with its traditional 60/40 portfolio allocation, struggling amid inflation and rising interest rates. With ballots going out in late August, Bei’s bitcoin credentials could resonate with California’s public workforce seeking new strategies to shore up their retirement security.

https://decrypt.co,Token Metrics CEO Ian Balina Says SEC to Drop Its Case Against Him,https://decrypt.co/309816/token-metrics-ceo-ian-balina-says-sec-to-drop-its-case-against-him,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 05:43:04 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Token Metrics CEO Ian Balina said Wednesday the SEC is expected to drop its case against him, ending a three-year legal battle over allegations he violated U.S. securities laws.

“It’s official: The SEC is dropping its case against me,” Balina tweeted. “This was never just about me—it’s about fairness in crypto.”

Balina’s charges stem from a September 2022 order alleging he failed to disclose compensation received while promoting the Sparkster (SPRK) initial coin offering.

Backing the CEO’s claim, Token Metrics tweeted Monday the charges had been ""dropped,"" adding that ""a possible shift in enforcement trends"" was underway.

It's worth noting the SEC has yet to provide an official statement on the matter. The SEC and Balina did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment.

The SEC has also not officially updated the case's status since September 2022, when it announced Sparkster and its CEO, Sajjad Daya, had settled for $35 million.

""This frivolous SEC charge sets a bad precedent for the entire crypto industry,"" Balina said at the time. ""If investing in a private sale with a discount is a crime, the entire crypto VC space is in trouble.""

The SEC's complaint alleged Balina received a 30% bonus on his $5 million investment in SPRK tokens but never disclosed this consideration when promoting the tokens to his substantial social media following.

In May 2024, a judge ruled SPRK tokens qualified as securities under the SEC's purview.

If confirmed by the regulator, the dismissal would follow several recent SEC decisions to abandon cases against crypto companies since President Trump appointed Mark Uyeda as acting SEC Chair following Gary Gensler's January departure.

So far, the SEC has dismissed a number of cases containing allegations of securities violations against crypto firms including Binance, Coinbase, OpenSea, Robinhood, Uniswap, Gemini, and Kraken, among others.

https://decrypt.co,"Coinbase to Halt Trading of Meme Coins Floki, Turbo, and Giga in New York",https://decrypt.co/309814/coinbase-to-halt-trading-of-meme-coins-floki-turbo-and-giga-in-new-york,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 05:02:06 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Crypto exchange Coinbase said Wednesday it is suspending trading of three popular meme coins in New York, following a recent review of its listed assets.

The exchange is halting the trading of Floki (FLOKI), Turbo (TURBO), and Gigachad (GIGA) in New York starting April 14, 2025, at 2 PM ET, per an announcement on X.

While the tokens will remain listed, trading will be suspended for users in the state as part of the exchange’s regular monitoring of its platform, it said.

The announcement has drawn immediate speculation from legal experts, with Ariel Givener, founder of GivenerLaw, suggesting on X, “I’d put a lot of money on this being tied to a pending legal case in NY.”

Despite the news, the market response has been muted. Floki gained 3.6%, Giga rose 1.1%, and Turbo saw a 5.4% increase in the last 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows.

In the case of Coinbase, the move follows the exchange's November announcement that Floki would be added to its listing roadmap, which led the token to a five-month high.

In December 2024, Turbo and Giga followed suit, jumping 15% and 37%, respectively, after their listing roadmaps were revealed.

The price surge was attributed to the so-called “Coinbase Effect,” where tokens often experience price boosts when added to the exchange’s roadmap or listings, only to stabilize afterward.

Meme coins—crypto based on internet jokes, memes, or cultural references—have seen significant popularity in recent years.

One of the most influential platforms driving this trend is Solana-based meme coin launchpad Pump.fun, which, since its launch in January 2024, has spawned 8.5 million meme tokens, Dune Analytics data shows.

The Securities and Exchange Commission under President Donald Trump’s administration recently clarified its stance on meme coins, saying such tokens typically do not qualify as securities under U.S. law.

Meme coins ""do not generate a yield or convey rights to future income, profits, or assets of a business,"" and thus do not fall under its jurisdiction, the SEC said.

Describing the rise of meme coins as “modern value creation,” Tracy Jin, COO of crypto exchange MEXC, told Decrypt that in 2025, ""the flagship of decentralized freedom is no longer Bitcoin, but an entire category of cryptocurrencies: meme coins, which started as simple jokes.""

However, Jin warned, ""Optimism should be met with a dose of caution,"" as the market faces new risks and uncertainties.

While meme coins offer “significant opportunities for traders and investors worldwide”, Jin said, “the green light” for meme coin launches comes with high trading risks, requiring investors to increase their research and analytical efforts.

Elon Musk’s claim that the DDoS attack on X (formerly Twitter) originated from Ukraine drew skepticism from cybersecurity experts, who argue that attributing attacks based on IP addresses is unreliable.

Attackers frequently use virtual private networks (VPNs) and other methods to obfuscate their origins, making pinpointing a specific geographic source difficult.

On Monday, X was the target of a distributed denial-of-service attack that intermittently shut down the popular social media site for users worldwide. The X DDoS attack was linked to Dark Storm Team, a notorious hackivist group known for launching similar large-scale cyber disruptions.

Hours after the attack, Musk claimed during an interview with Fox Business that the IP addresses associated with the attack originated in the Ukraine area.

Tech-savvy users on X quickly pointed out that IP addresses can be masked or spoofed, making them appear to originate from one region when they actually originate from another.

Dear Elon:

You can't attribute an attack to any geographic location by IP address alone.

See: VPN, location spoofing, etc.

Also See: How botnets are controlled remotely

Also Also See: Ask a cybersecurity person to help you. — MikeTalonNYC (@MikeTalonNYC) March 10, 2025

Cybersecurity professionals also cautioned against drawing conclusions based solely on IP address data.

“Attackers use strategies like IP Spoofing, VPNs and servers infected with malware to perform these attacks,” Siri Vegiraju, Software Development Engineer at Microsoft Azure told Decrypt. “Specifically, with IP spoofing attackers create packets with false source IP addresses to basically impersonate other systems.”

Adding to the difficulty of stopping DDoS attacks is that they are inherently decentralized, making them difficult to trace.

“If one were conducting a DDoS attack you wouldn't necessarily see each connection originating from an IP address from a specific nation or netblock,” Scott Renna, Senior Solutions Architect with blockchain security firm Halborn, told Decrypt. “By definition, the attack would have to come from multiple IP addresses.”

Renna pointed out that attackers distribute their traffic across numerous locations to avoid detection and mitigation efforts.

“From an optics perspective and a blocking and prevention standpoint, it's just not how it's typically done,” he said.

While the origins of the X attack remain a mystery, DDoS-as-a-Service websites are popping up to facilitate the launch of large-scale attacks. These websites let customers pay to launch DDoS attacks.

There are two main types of DaaS.

""Stresser"" services, which are legitimate tools companies use to test and strengthen their IT infrastructure. Then there are ""Booter"" services, which are malicious platforms designed to disrupt or take down targeted systems.

Cybersecurity teams can use DDoS blackhole routing and geo-blocking to minimize the impact of DDoS attacks, which could have prevented the type of attack that disrupted X this week.

Blackhole routing is an emergency measure that instantly blocks all traffic to a targeted IP during an attack, but it also affects legitimate users, making it a temporary solution.

Geo-blocking limits access from high-risk regions, reducing cyber threats without disrupting most users.

​In April 2022, internet security provider Cloudflare successfully mitigated a massive DDoS attack targeting an unidentified cryptocurrency website that attempted to overwhelm the service with 15.3 million requests per second.

While services like Cloudflare excel at defending against cyber threats, Renna emphasized the importance of preparing for potential failures.

""Services like Cloudflare do a good job for businesses,"" Renna said. ""But it comes down to what happens when those fail.""

The LIBRA crypto scandal that rocked Argentina's political landscape entered a new phase this week after Gregorio Dalbon, an Argentine lawyer, formally requested the international detention of Hayden Davis, the crypto entrepreneur identified as the alleged central figure behind the token's collapse.

The petition, submitted Tuesday to lead prosecutor Eduardo Taiano and Judge María Servini, seeks an Interpol Red Notice to facilitate Davis's detention and extradition from the U.S.

Dalbon, who represented former Argentine President Cristina Fernandez over a corruption case, did not immediately return Decrypt's multiple requests for comment. A request from Decrypt to Davis’ lawyer has gone unanswered.

Details of the development were initially reported by Argentine media outlets Página12 and Perfil, marking an escalation in the legal proceedings surrounding a case that has ensnared President Javier Milei's administration in controversy, after the president publicly promoted the token shortly before its catastrophic price collapse.

Decrypt has tracked and documented the LIBRA controversy, reporting on the token's creation, its immediate effects to the Argentine stock market, the people behind it and their connections, the charges against Milei, its fallout, and later calls for education to keep communities informed against such schemes.

Earlier this month, Taiano moved to freeze approximately $100 million in crypto associated with the case.

Red Notice

Dalbon's petition argues that Davis presents a substantial flight risk due to his economic resources and foreign residence, according to multiple local media reports.

""Given the magnitude of the scandal and the significant losses caused to investors, the procedural risk implied by Hayden Mark Davis remaining free is evident,"" the document written by Dalbón reads as cited by Perfil.

Davis had a ""central role in the creation and promotion of LIBRA,"" Dalbón argued.

The lawyer specifically requested authorities to order the international detention of Hayden Mark Davis and proceed with an Interpol Red Notice to ""locate and arrest him, with a view to his extradition,"" as cited by Página12.

A Red Notice represents a request by Interpol to law enforcement agencies worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest an individual pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action.

Red Notices do not compel member countries to make arrests, instead each nation decides whether to act based on its own laws and treaty obligations.

They are also based on arrest warrants or court orders issued by judicial authorities in the requesting country and are typically used for serious crimes such as murder, fraud, and other major offenses.

If approved, Dalbon's request would be transmitted to Interpol for potential distribution to its 195 member countries.

https://decrypt.co,Bitcoin Miner Bitdeer's Own BTC Holdings Surge Since Start of Year,https://decrypt.co/309714/bitcoin-miner-bitdeers-own-btc-holdings-surge-since-start-of-year,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 22:32:33 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Publicly traded Bitcoin miner Bitdeer has increased its Bitcoin holdings by about 75% since the year began.

The firm’s latest investor release provides an update on its self-mining activity, which produced 110 Bitcoin in February—a small decrease from January’s mark of 126 BTC, which it attributes to last month having fewer days.

Self-mining, which refers to the company mining for its own holdings, makes up one-third of the company’s business ventures, alongside its cloud hash subscription and hosted mining solutions.

The firm’s total holdings have now risen to 1,039 Bitcoin, or nearly $87 million at today’s prices—a roughly 75% jump from December’s holdings of 594 BTC. Other publicly traded Bitcoin miners like MARA and Riot Platforms hold 45,659 BTC and 18,692 BTC, respectively, making them the biggest holders among public miners.

With more than 1,000 Bitcoin in holdings, the company now meets the threshold outlined by crypto asset manager Bitwise in its newly launched ETF that tracks publicly traded companies with Bitcoin holdings. However, Bitwise has not yet indicated that it plans to add the firm’s shares.

In addition to its self-mining update, Bitdeer also provided infrastructure construction updates on a variety of locations worldwide.

Bitdeer, which trades on the Nasdaq Exchange as BTDR, closed up 1.32% today at $10.71 per share. The company recently reported a fourth quarter loss of $532 million, dropping its stock price by 20% in the process.

A filing last year revealed that stablecoin firm Tether owns a 25% stake in the Singapore-based miner.

BTDR shares are down over 50% year-to-date, but have jumped by 70% over the last 12 months.

The cryptocurrency industry notched two major victories last year when several fund issuers secured long-awaited approvals to offer spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and their Ethereum-based counterparts in the U.S. But that doesn't mean issuers are ready to rest on their laurels just yet.

In recent months, fund managers have proposed new investment offerings directly tracking the prices of a variety of cryptocurrencies, from Dogecoin to XRP, Solana, and even Donald Trump’s meme coin.

Here are the various crypto-based ETFs that could soon be offered in the United States, and a look at the high-profile filings so far for each asset.



Solana

Spot Solana exchange-traded funds are one potential alternative to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs that could begin trading in the U.S. this year or next.



The proposed funds, which include the VanEck Solana Trust, 21Shares Core Solana ETF, Canary Solana ETF, and Bitwise Solana ETF, would directly track the price of the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.

Franklin Templeton joined the fray in February, as well, filing an S-1 registration statement with the SEC. In March, CBOE filed on behalf of Franklin Templeton for a rule change to list the proposed fund.

Meanwhile, a handful of proposed Solana futures ETFs such as the ProShares Short Solana, ProShares 2x Solana, and Vol Shares’ Solana ETF would enable investors to make more complex bets on Solana's price movements.

However, both spot and futures Solana ETFs will likely not begin trading in the U.S. until 2026, according to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffert. That’s because the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission still has to assess a batch of spot Solana ETF applications.

The SEC typically takes between 240 and 260 days to make decisions on applications. But ongoing litigation over whether Solana is or isn't a security could prolong that process for several would-be Solana ETFs. The regulator acknowledged Grayscale's Solana ETF application on February 6 and is seeking public comment on the filing, marking what one analyst called ""new territory"" for the agency.

Nevertheless, if and when spot Solana ETFs are approved, the investor dollars they attract could be massive. JP Morgan analysts predict Solana ETFs could collectively bring in between $4 and $8 billion in investments.

Dogecoin

A few issuers have signaled that they plan to offer spot Dogecoin ETFs following a wave of political events that slingshotted the Shiba Inu-inspired meme coin to a three-year-high price of $0.48 in December.

Exchange-traded fund provider Rex Shares applied in January to launch the Rex-Osprey DOGE ETF, the company’s filing with federal regulators shows.

Meanwhile, Bitwise Asset Management has registered a Dogecoin ETF entity in Delaware, a major step towards applying for permission to launch an exchange-traded fund based on Elon Musk's beloved cryptocurrency. But Bitwise still needs to file a comprehensive application with the SEC before any potential fund could come to market.

Finally, crypto-focused investment firm Grayscale has also signaled its intention to launch a Dogecoin ETF. The asset manager launched in late January a Dogecoin Trust, enabling institutional and accredited investors to allocate funds to the meme coin. Shortly thereafter, Grayscale filed a 19b-4 form to convert that Trust into an ETF, joining several of its competitors in planning to roll out such a fund.

The SEC acknowledged Grayscale's filing in February, but then in March delayed its decision, giving the agency until May 21 to make a call either way.

Analysts are bullish that it won't take long for Dogecoin ETFs to hit the market, however. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said in January that a spot Dogecoin ETF could theoretically launch as early as April, thanks to a rule that enables federal regulators to weigh in on investment offering proposals within an expedited 75-day timeframe, rather than the typical review period of eight to nine months.

XRP

Funds created around the Ripple-linked XRP—such as the Rex-Osprey XRP ETF, Canary XRP ETF, and 21Shares Core XRP Trust—are up for review in the U.S.

In early February, Chicago's Cboe Exchange applied with federal regulators to list and trade four spot XRP ETFs — a sign of growing investor interest in funds tracking Ripple Lab's crypto asset. The spot XRP ETFs would be issued by WisdomTree, Bitwise, 21Shares, and Canary Capital, respectively.

Franklin Templeton joined the party in March, right as the SEC punted on making a decision on Grayscale's XRP filing.

The SEC acknowledged multiple XRP applications in late February, saying that comments would be submitted within 21 days of the filings. That brings the ETFs one step closer to be approved in the U.S.

However, it remains unclear whether the ETFs will be approved or not. A rash of expected rule changes at the SEC point to a higher likelihood that regulators could soon green light the funds in the U.S.

If XRP ETFs are approved, then the funds could collectively bring in between $3 and $6 billion in investments, according to a January estimate from J.P. Morgan analysts.

Beyond spot XRP ETFs, XRP futures-based exchange-traded funds such as the ProShares Short XRP and ProShares 2x XRP are also up for consideration in the U.S.

The former would allow investors to short XRP, while the latter would enable investors to make leveraged bets on the cryptocurrency's future price movements.

Bitcoin Plus ETF

Trump Media and Technology Group's Truth.Fi has applied to register a trademark for two “Bitcoin Plus” products, in addition to four other investment vehicles. The funds are called Truth.Fi Bitcoin Plus ETF and Truth.Fi Bitcoin Plus SMA.

It remains unclear which assets the Bitcoin Plus ETFs would hold, if approved. It's possible the “plus” part of their names could refer to another cryptocurrency which the funds would track alongside Bitcoin. Truth.Fi did not respond to Decrypt's request for comment and clarification.

Crypto Index ETF

In early February, asset manager Franklin Templeton filed an amended petition to offer its “Franklin Crypto Index ETF.”

If approved, the exchange-traded fund will track Bitcoin and Ethereum, weighting the assets 86.31% and 13.69%, respectively. It could also include additional cryptocurrencies in the future, Franklin Templeton said in its filing.

Aptos

Crypto asset manager Bitwise submitted an S-1 filing with the Securities Commission in early March, signaling its plans to launch an exchange-traded fund tracking the price of Aptos (APT).

The filing came just a few days after the asset manager had mode moves to establish a Delaware trust—laying the groundwork for its Aptos ETF.

Sui

Sui, another brainchild of ex-Meta stablecoin project members, may soon become available to investors in the form of an exchange-traded fund.

Canary Capital took an early step toward spinning up a SUI-based ETF in early March, filing for a Delaware Trust.

Movement

Rex Shares and Osprey Funds teamed up in early March to file for approval to offer an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks MOVE, the native token of the Movement Network.

The asset managers submitted their filing for a MOVE-based ETF to U.S. regulators as the Ethereum layer-2 network launched its mainnet in beta.

HBAR

Canary Capital filed for the first HBAR ETF last November. HBAR is the native cryptocurrency of the Hedera network.

In an X post in December, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas expressed optimism about a spot HBAR ETF’s odds of receiving approval in the U.S., saying that such a fund could launch before its higher-profile Solana and XRP-based counterparts. Despite that, it remains unclear whether there is sufficient investor demand for such a fund, he said.

Litecoin

A rash of Litecoin-based ETF applications were filed following President Donald Trump's inauguration, as the chilly crypto regulatory environment shows signs of thawing.

CoinShares filed two registration statements for a ""CoinShares Litecoin ETF"" and ""CoinShares XRP ETF,"" while the New York Stock Exchange signaled that Greyscale is trying to convert its existing Litecoin Trust into an ETF.

The new filings came roughly two months after Canary Capital filed for its own Litecoin ETF, and days after Canary submitted an amendment to its application for the fund.

Litecoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency created to improve verification time for blockchain transactions. Much like its spot HBAR ETF counterpart, Canary Capital's Litecoin ETF is likely to get approved before Dogecoin, XRP, and Solana-based funds, according to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas.

That's because Litecoin's regulatory status is less disputed than that of other altcoins such as Solana, which remain at the center of a legal battle between the SEC and major crypto industry players, according to Balchunas.

BONK, Trump, and beyond

Rex Shares filed with federal regulators in January to launch spot Trump and BONK-based ETFs, respectively.

The proposed funds form part of a growing list of meme coin-based investment products spun up by issuers, who are apparently eager to capitalize on investors’ growing interest in the digital assets market amid the latest crypto bull run.

Bloomberg analysts predict that TRUMP, BONK, and other meme coin-based ETFs could begin trading as soon as April—that is, if issuers’ proposals undergo and pass an expedited review process with federal regulators.

Russia’s central bank has proposed new regulations that would allow high net-worth individuals to buy and sell cryptocurrencies during a three-year testing period, the bank said in a statement Wednesday.

The bank said that it would allow “‘particularly qualified’ investors,” those with investments in stocks and deposits exceeding 100 million rubles (about $11.5 million) or with income in the past year of more than 50 million rubles (approximately $5.7 million).

It will also allow institutions that are “qualified investors” to “become participants in the experiment,” adding that it would “establish regulatory requirements taking into account the level and nature of risks of such an asset.”

“The introduction of the EPR is aimed at increasing the transparency of the cryptocurrency market, forming standards for the provision of services, expanding investment opportunities for experienced investors who are ready to take on increased risks,” the bank said.

In 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law banning the use of digital assets for payments. But the country has since become more open to the industry—especially following its war with Ukraine: lawmakers last year voted to legalize cryptocurrency use for international payments.

In its announcement, the bank said that cryptocurrencies as a form of payment were still not allowed in the country. The bank noted that cryptocurrencies are “not guaranteed by any…jurisdictions,” and subject to increased volatility.”

Russia has used cryptos to evade U.S. and European sanctions imposed after the country’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, which broke international law.

President Vladimir Putin last year signed a law allowing cryptocurrency mining in the country.

In a public forum last December, he asked if anyone could realistically stop Bitcoin.

“For example, Bitcoin, who can ban it?” Putin asked rhetorically. “Nobody. And who can prohibit the use of other electronic payment instruments? Nobody, because these are new technologies.”

Later that day, the biggest and oldest cryptocurrency broke past the mythical $100,000 mark. Bitcoin was recently trading near $83,000, roughly flat over the past 24 hours but more than 20% down from its all-time high near $109,000.

Video-sharing platform Rumble added $17.1 million in Bitcoin to its corporate treasury‌, aligning itself with a crop of publicly traded companies that have added the world's oldest cryptocurrency to their balance sheets.

The Nasdaq-listed firm purchased roughly 188 Bitcoin for its treasury at an average price of $91,000 per token, the company said Wednesday in a statement. The Bitcoin is now worth about $15.5 million based on Wednesday’s price.

The move forms part of Rumble’s plan to allocate up to $20 million of its excess cash reserves to Bitcoin.

“These holdings have the potential to serve as a valuable hedge against inflation and will not be subject to dilution like so many overprinted government-issued currencies,” Rumble Chairman and CEO Chris Pavlovsk said in the statement.

Decrypt's reached out to Rumble for additional comment.

Rumble’s investment in Bitcoin comes as a growing number of publicly traded companies adopt a similar strategy to Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which pivoted its focus from software several years ago to become a Bitcoin treasury that now holds more than 444,000 Bitcoin, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. Tesla, and Semler Scientific are among those firms that have accumulated large stockpiles of bitcoin in recent years.

Rumble announced its plan to pour funds into Bitcoin late last year, around the time the asset sailed to an all-time high of nearly $109,000.

Although Bitcoin's price has more than 20% since then, according to CoinGecko data, the token rebounded above $83,000 on Tuesday, amid pro-crypto regulatory developments in the U.S.

With Bitcoin’s price down from earlier levels, some companies are buying the dip.

Metaplanet, for example, revealed Wednesday that it recently allocated an additional $13.2 million of its funds to Bitcoin. And Srategy earlier this week introduced a plan to sell $21 billion in stock to purchase more Bitcoin.

In its statement, Rumble called Bitcoin a “valuable tool for strategic planning” as it aims to expand into the cryptocurrency world.

“We are proud to officially hold Bitcoin as we continue to grow and engrain crypto into our company’s DNA,” Pavlovsk said.

Rumble's shares are trading at $7.94 as of writing time, up roughly 2% in the past 24 hours.

Nebraska bill LB609, which will help protect users of Bitcoin ATMs and other electronic kiosks, was signed into law Wednesday by Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen.

The Controllable Electronic Record Fraud Prevention Act implements regulations to warn individuals of potential fraudulent behavior, and prevent them from being harmed. While the text of the bill itself isn’t significantly focused on crypto terminology, the governor’s office put out a statement Thursday saying that it's a key part of the state’s embrace of crypto.

“Cryptocurrency is an important, emerging industry—and we’ve been working hard to build Nebraska into a cryptocurrency leader,” said Governor Pillen in the statement. “An important part of these efforts is to make sure that we have guardrails to prevent criminals from taking advantage of Nebraskans.”

Part of the Fraud Prevention Act regulations will require electronic kiosk operators to clearly and boldly disclose all terms to users, including distinct warnings about the signs of consumer fraud.

Additionally, it creates clear guidelines for fraudulently induced behavior. For example, new or existing customers that report the fraudulent activity within 90 days to the operator and law enforcement are subject to receive a full refund from the operator.

“Nebraska is open for business in the cryptocurrency space,” said Nebraska Department of Banking Director Kelly Lammers in the statement. “Those doing legal business in the State of Nebraska, you are absolutely welcome.”

“Of course, those that target our citizens,” Lammers continued, “that look to exploit Nebraskans and their financial resources, using crypto ATMs as part of their transfer method, we will soon have a team that will be watching even more closely.""

Fraudulent activity at Bitcoin ATMs and cryptocurrency kiosks has been on the rise as the machines gain popularity. In data provided to NBC News, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) indicated that consumers lost more than $110 million in scams related to the machines in 2023.

In late February, Illinois Senator Dick Durbin introduced a similar bill which would impose regulations on Bitcoin ATMs in his state. Data from Coin ATM Radar indicates that nearly 30,000 Bitcoin and cryptocurrency ATMs are operating in the United States at present time.

Unlike many states, Nebraska is not currently considering any legislation to establish a Bitcoin and/or cryptocurrency reserve. President Trump signed an executive order last week to launch a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and a separate digital asset stockpile.

Discover SCENE

Former Supreme Court attorney and alleged tax evader Tom Goldstein had access to a cryptocurrency wallet that channeled $100 million in transfers, according to a new filing from US federal prosecutors.

The US originally filed an indictment against Goldstein—who is also known for co-founding the popular SCOTUSblog—on January 16, including counts of violating federal tax laws and failing to report cryptocurrency transactions.

Filed on March 6, the latest submission includes new information regarding the volume of transactions on two unhosted wallets allegedly associated with Goldstein.

One of them, referred to only as “935B,” served as a channel through which Goldstein appeared to have received and then sent out payments, often in connection with gambling, prosecutors claim.

The filing states, “According to [the defendant’s] own expert, the 935B wallet has received and sent approximately $100,000,000 in cryptocurrency between its creation in November 2022 and the present.”

Goldstein denies that he owns the wallet in question, with his attorneys stating that he had been given its address by another individual, and also pointing out that it processed a withdrawal of 2 million USDT when he was detained on February 11 of this year.

US prosecutors take issue with this defense, arguing in their latest filing that even if Goldstein doesn’t control the 935B wallet, he had given its address to a ‘fixer’ in order to receive 500,000 USDC in May 2023. That, they argue, underscores how Goldstein ""has used, and can continue to use, unhosted cryptocurrency wallets to facilitate transfers of large sums of money with gambling and/or foreign contacts.”

The filing has been submitted in opposition to a February 27 appeal from Goldstein against his bail conditions, in particular against a condition which requires the monitoring of his “internet capable devices.”

Goldstein had originally been granted bail following his indictment in January, but had then been detained on February 11, with prosecutors arguing that he posed a significant flight risk.

Yet Goldstein successfully appealed against his pretrial detention on February 13, with Judge Timothy Sullivan granting bail on the condition that the defendant explicitly disclose all of his assets—including cryptocurrencies—to pretrial services.

In granting bail, Judge Sullivan said that, “it now even appears that Mr. Goldstein currently has cryptocurrency accounts – besides the 935B and 54E3 wallets –that he controls, and of which he did not inform his supervising Pretrial Services officer.”

In addition to monitoring his internet usage, the conditions also require Goldstein to abstain from all cryptocurrency transactions.

According to the January 16 indictment, the former lawyer had “falsely stated” on his 2020 and 2021 tax returns that “he had not received, sold, sent, exchanged, or otherwise acquired or disposed of any financial interest in any virtual currency – despite the fact that he had engaged in dozens of cryptocurrency transactions totaling over $10 million over those two tax years.”

In a March 10 filing in support of Goldstein’s latest appeal, his lawyers state that the prosecutors’ charges amount to “the allegation that Mr. Goldstein failed to check a box on his tax returns.”

Prior to leaving the legal profession in 2023, Goldstein had argued over 40 cases in the Supreme Court, and was part of the legal team representing Al Gore in the latter’s case with George W. Bush following the 2000 presidential election.",decrypt

Cboe on Wednesday filed for a rules change with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that would enable the exchange to list shares for a Solana exchange-traded fund proposed by Franklin Templeton.

The submission comes less than week after the investment manager applied for the ETF that would track the sixth largest cryptocurrency by market value and underscores the quickening pace that these funds are being proposed and considered and growing interest in Solana funds.

Once the SEC acknowledges the 19b-4 submission, the regulator has 240 days to decide on the request.

The SEC has started a period for public comment on spot Solana funds proposed by Canary Capital, VanEck, 21Shares and Bitwise. Earlier this month, Grayscale Investments also applied for an ETF, with the SEC's acknowledgment, positioning it as a potential bellwether for a broader group of proposals.

Franklin Templeton is among several firms to apply for ETFs tracking XRP, the third largest crypto by market capitalization. Other issuers have also recently proposed funds tracking Litecoin, Dogecoin and Cardano.

Those applications and related iniatives in the ETF space have followed the roaring success of spot bitcoin ETFs, which won approval 14 months ago after years of SEC resistance. Those funds now manage close to $100 billion in assets. Spot Ethereum funds have generated less interest but have still generated nearly $2.5 billion in net inflows in their roughly eight-month history.

The Solana token was recently trading at about $124, roughly flat over the past 24 hours, although less than half its all-time high set in January–swept up in the wider crypto rout of the past two months. Solana has been the favored blockchain for developers of meme coins, some of which have been particularly hard hit over this period.

Franklin Templeton first dipped its toes in the crypto space in 2019, when it started digitizing shares for a money market fund on the Stellar blockchain.

It then announced a digital asset venture fund back in 2021, and now operates Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs.

https://decrypt.co,Ethereum Lags Behind Bitcoin Rebound as Devs Work Towards Pectra Upgrade,https://decrypt.co/309663/ethereum-lags-behind-bitcoin-pectra-upgrade,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 14:36:12 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Even as Bitcoin finds some buoyancy following a better-than-expected U.S. inflation report, Ethereum has been lagging behind.

Since the new CPI report landed early Wednesday, the Bitcoin price has gained 3% as it holds key support levels. Meanwhile, the Ethereum price has been playing catch up, seeing a 0.5% gain, Coingecko data shows.

Tracy Jin, vice president of crypto exchange MEXC, told Decrypt that a successful implementation of Ethereum’s Petra upgrade could significantly strengthen the fundamentals of the second-largest blockchain.

If the upgrade resolves issues with network throughput and transaction costs, she said, it could enhance Ethereum's appeal and drive demand for ETH to Jin. Just yesterday, Ethereum devs achieved finality on the Holesky testnet—buffeting hopes that the Pectra upgrade won’t be delayed much longer.

“Under favorable conditions, ETH may reach $6,000–7,000 this year,” Jin said.

But she was careful to add that none of the major Ethereum upgrades have been without technical difficulties, delays, or changes. Jin said there’s a “high probability” that as devs continue work towards the Pectra upgrade, it could leave ETH vulnerable to “increased volatility” for the next 3-6 months.

""In conditions of uncertainty, investors often seek refuge in safer assets, like the U.S. dollar, which leads to decreased interest in risky assets, including cryptocurrencies,” she added.

Even as President Donald Trump’s trade wars continue to spark uncertainty in the markets, the most recent U.S. CPI report has improved hopes that the Federal Reserve may enact at least one interest rate cut in the first half of 2025.

It’s usually the case that when inflation shows signs of cooling, the chances of a rate cut could increase, providing a bullish signal for digital assets. And after this morning’s better-than-expected CPI print, markets are pricing in a 55% chance of seeing a rate cut in June, according to the CME FedWath Tool.

Even if there’s been a recent rebound, institutional investors continue to pull back from cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin ETFs have seen outflows of $371 million and Ethereum ETF witnessing $22 million, per Farside Investors data.

“This trend reflects broader weakness in risk assets, with markets still searching for fresh liquidity to reignite momentum,” Valentin Fournier, an analyst at BRN, told Decrypt.

Fournier noted that despite the bearish market sentiment, the stabilization of digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum at key support levels is encouraging.

""In the near term, decisive action from the U.S. government could be the key driver to push Bitcoin back toward its previous all-time high,"" Fournier noted.

It has been a brutal market in recent weeks. But this morning, most major meme coins have finally seen a much welcomed bounce.

That said, the Official Trump (TRUMP) token lags behind its meme coin competitors, posting middling gains comparatively, while President Donald Trump’s trade war rages on.

Sector leaders Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE) have rebounded 9.2%, 7.9%, and 16.3% respectively. Although the fourth largest meme coin by market capitalization, Official Trump (TRUMP), has climbed just 1.5%. It’s now down 21% over the week—the biggest weekly loss among the top five meme coins by market cap.

TRUMP launched just days before the President’s inauguration, sending the market into euphoria as traders believed a new era for crypto was upon us.

However, when the first lady launched her own token, Melania Meme (MELANIA), the TRUMP token crashed 32% over six hours. Both tokens have mostly been in the red since then. The TRUMP token has now sagged 85% from its all-time high to a $2.09 billion market cap.

At its peak, TRUMP was at $15.16 billion. That made it the second largest meme coin by market cap.

As of February 11, 9.6% betters on Myriad Markets—a prediction market owned by Decrypt parent company Dastan—believed that TRUMP will end Q1 as the top meme coin by market cap. But as of today, the share of TRUMP believers has shrunk to just 2.8%, with 68% of betters thinking it stays in fourth place and 15% thinking it falls out of the top 10 entirely.

Out of the top 10 meme coins by market cap, only Brett (BRETT) has performed worse than TRUMP over the past seven days, according to CoinGecko data, falling 25%.

The poor performance of the President’s official meme coin is likely a symptom of Trump falling out of favor in the eyes of the public.

According to pollster YouGov, 38% of US adults believe that Donald Trump is doing a “much worse” job so far in his second term than they expected. Equally, Trump’s disapproval rating has started to climb from 45.8% the week after inauguration to 48.9% last week. In doing this, 51% of US registered voters now view the President unfavorably.

Trump’s second term has already been filled with drama and controversy, including a public argument with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. But most important, at least for crypto investors, has been his trade war with the U.S.’s largest trading partners.

Most recently, Trump’s 25% tariff on steel and aluminium came into effect. That’s caused the European Union to announce it will retaliate with “countermeasures.”

As such, the S&P 500 has also fallen 3.6% over the past five days and extended its monthly loss to 8.4, according to TradingView. With the broader traditional market bleeding, high risk assets like meme coins often also take a hit.

That said, despite the S&P 500’s continued decline of 0.76% on the day, the overall meme coin market, according to CoinGecko, has bounced 8%.

Maybe Fartcoin—which has gained 21% in the past day—really is the future of finance.

Bitcoin traders are increasingly hedging against a potential downturn, a sign of growing caution as broader financial markets retreat ahead of key U.S. economic data.

The options market—where investors buy contracts to bet on or protect against future price moves—shows traders are positioning defensively.

According to Nick Forster, founder of onchain derivatives platform Derive.xyz, demand for protective contracts has risen, particularly for so-called put options, which give holders the right to sell Bitcoin at a set price.

""Derivatives are positioned defensively right now, with the immediate 25-delta call/put skews hitting 2025 lows,"" Forster said.

In simpler terms, traders are paying more for downside protection than they have at any point this year, with many focusing on contracts that would allow them to sell Bitcoin in the $75,000 to $70,000 range through the end of March.

At the same time, demand for call options, which give the right to buy at a fixed price, has weakened.

Many contracts that were previously profitable at Bitcoin’s market price are now positioned at higher levels, meaning traders see less urgency in betting on a quick run-up.

""This is creating muted volatilities across the board, with little excitement up to the $100,000 range,"" Forster said. ""The current market feels uncertain, and traders are preparing for potential volatility in either direction.""

Early trading in Asia revealed some contradictory signals have emerged, according to QCP Capital, with demand for longer-dated topside calls—options that profit from a price rebound—building.

""This potentially signals positioning for a swift rebound from the $75,000 support level seen pre-election,"" QCP wrote in a note on Tuesday.

Indeed, the price of the world's largest crypto has jumped 3.8% to 82,375 over the last 24 hours and has clawed back earlier losses near $77,000.

In any case, the defensive tone in Bitcoin trading mirrors broader market sentiment.

On Monday, the S&P 500 fell 0.76%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.14%, as investors braced for the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) report scheduled for release on Wednesday.

Economists anticipate a 0.3% increase in headline inflation for February, which would bring the annual CPI rate down to 2.9%, according to MarketWatch.

That could offer some relief to risk assets, including crypto and stocks, while giving the Federal Reserve more confidence to consider the timing of its next rate-cutting cycle, Decrypt was told.

In Europe, the STOXX 600 index dropped 1.43%, while oil prices edged higher, with Brent crude settling at $69.97 per barrel.",decrypt

Ardoino stood out from the crowd, not for his wealth but for his choice of attire. While others dressed to impress, he opted for a laid-back look — a light blue Ralph Lauren polo and gray khakis — despite likely having the deepest pockets in the room.

“This is my first trip to America,” he started off saying. “It’s beautiful. I feel very welcomed.”

Ardoino indeed avoided the country for a long time. The Italy-born computer scientist until recently mainly focused Tether’s operations on developing regions, with financial freedom as the stated goal.

Another reason could be that Tether has been under scrutiny from industry leaders as well as U.S. authorities for some time, including the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYFSD).

That's changed. Ardoino has been on a tour of the U.S. over the past week, posting photos of himself on the U.S. Capitol Building steps in Washington D.C. on Thursday and participating in a fireside chat with Strike CEO Jack Mallers at a Tuesday event organized by the Bitcoin Policy Institute.

The company, which according to Ardoino is run by only 150 employees across 50 countries, settled charges with the CFTC and an NYDFS inquiry in 2021. There have been numerous reports of an ongoing Department of Justice investigation into the stablecoin issuer as well over the past few years.

“We’ve been through hell,” Ardoino told attendees at the conference. “People were saying that if I came to the U.S. I’d be arrested ... They will try to scare you off.""

""We’re still here, right?”

After a rundown of Tether’s previous success in the stablecoin business — the company reportedly made a $13 billion profit in 2024 and its stablecoin, USDT, holds over 60% of market share among stablecoins — Ardoino went on to present current projects that the company is working on, including its efforts in education, AI and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization.

“The outlook for this year is wonderful as well,” Ardoino said.

Ardoino's U.S. journey came at a time when the U.S. legislature is moving forward to regulate the $200 billion and rapidly growing stablecoin market. Tether is dominating the asset class with its $143 billion USDT cryptocurrency, followed by U.S.-based competitor Circle with its $58 billion USDC token.

While Tether is an offshore company — it recently announced its intention to establish its headquarters in El Salvador — and has yet to show interest in formally entering the U.S. crypto market, its ties to the U.S. are multifaceted.

The firm is one of the biggest buyers of U.S. debt, holding nearly $100 billion worth of U.S. Treasuries and government-backed securities as a reserve asset for its USDT token. If it were a country, it would be among the top 20 U.S. debt holders. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said during a White House digital asset summit on Friday that stablecoins are key to preserving the U.S. dollar as the dominant reserve currency in the world, a line of argument that Ardoino touted multiple occasions before.

The company also gained a powerful ally in the Trump administration in Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, former CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, the Wall Street investment firm that manages Tether's U.S. Treasury holdings. The Wall Street Journal reported that Cantor is also invested in Tether's holding company, while Lutnick said during his confirmation hearing that Cantor holds Tether convertible bonds but has no equity stake.

Ardoino, in an interview with CoinDesk last year, said that the firm also onboarded U.S. agencies such as the FBI and Secret Service to its platform in an effort to combat illicit activities.

On the investment front, Tether became a major shareholder with a $775 million investment in U.S.-listed video sharing platform Rumble, popular among U.S. conservative and right-wing users. With Tether's backing, Rumble CEO Chris Pavloski laid out plans to introduce a crypto wallet and support payments with USDT, BTC and Tether's gold-backed token XAUT.

Trump’s surprising blessing of ADA alongside XRP and SOL showed that Trump was pro-altcoin and disregarded the Gary Gensler-led SEC’s designations of these assets as unregistered securities. Devastating to bitcoin (BTC) maximalists, it proved that Trump didn’t seem particularly concerned with distinguishing BTC from other digital assets.

It also proved that politics pays. Ethereum Foundation ex-CEO and Cardano founder, Charles Hoskinson has been very active in public affairs. Within the past year, Hoskinson has created a Political Action Committee, endorsed a US presidential candidate, donated to a Senate election campaign, and attended many political galas and meetings alongside Trump’s allies.

However, Hoskinson received disappointing news on March 6 — just four days after Trump promised to include ADA in a US Crypto Strategic Reserve. In the intervening four days, Trump and Sacks had decided to split their promise into two funds: a BTC-only reserve and an altcoin-only stockpile.

Cardano relegated to no-buying-allowed stockpile

Tragically for the Cardano community, ADA would be placed in the stockpile and would not benefit from any purchases. Instead, its fund would only allow holding and selling — no buying allowed. Only the BTC reserve would have Trump’s approval for government purchases.

Despite widely publicized rumors that Trump’s team had invited Hoskinson to the White House Crypto Summit on March 7, he was not in attendance.

So basically you do not want to say that you didn’t got the invite — TESLARAN (@teslaran_doge) March 7, 2025

Since that disappointment, ADA has retraced all of its gains. Reaching a high of $1.14 within minutes of Trump’s March 2 commitment, it has fallen back to $0.73 as of publication time. ETH, XRP, and SOL have also given back all of their March 2 gains as Trump reneged on his promise to reserve, rather than merely stockpile, these four assets.

Even if ADA is included in the US Digital Asset Stockpile — note that the word “strategic” is excluded from that name — ADA will have de minimis representation. According to an estimate by Arkham, and with the caveat that Sacks is still conducting an audit of governmental crypto holdings, the US government probably holds less than $1 million worth of ADA.

Down $15 billion since Trump reneged

In summary, ADA’s brief surge following Trump’s initial promise swiftly reversed when he put altcoins into a non-purchasing stockpile.

Once the fifth-largest crypto asset by market cap at the time of Trump’s initial commitment, ADA has notched down the leaderboard to eighth place. It has lost $15 billion in market cap since March 2.

In the weeks since, Hoskinson has been spending his time commenting on crypto markets generally, criticizing Solana and memecoins, posting memes, and working on issues related to IOHK, Cardano, and his other interests.

https://decrypt.co,HYPE Token Drops as Leveraged Trade Sparks $4 Million Loss for Hyperliquid,https://decrypt.co/309684/hype-drops-leveraged-trade-4m-hyperliquid-loss,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 17:24:48 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Decentralized exchange Hyperliquid said on Wednesday that a user was able to profit on a highly leveraged Ethereum trade before it was liquidated.

A user with a wallet beginning in “0xf3f4” was able to make $1.8 million in profit before the position was forcibly closed, the DEX said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.

Hyperliquid emphasized that the $285 million Ethereum trade was not related to a “protocol exploit or hack.”

But the user’s bet, which relied on 50x leverage to supercharge their position, still resulted in a $4 million in loss for a community-owned vault dubbed the Hyperliquidity Provider (HLP).

Users are able to pool funds into the community-owned vault, potentially earning a return as the HLP executes trading strategies and accrues platform fees. However, as the HLP moved to liquidate 0xf3f4’s position, the vault was stuck holding a toxic position.

0xf3f4’s gains may have evaporated as the user tried to exit their trade, but Hyperliquid said that 0xf3f4 was able to avoid this by instead withdrawing collateral. That increased the price at which the user’s position would be liquidated until Hyperliquid was ultimately forced to step in.

Since May 2023, the HLP has profited $60 million, according to the DEX’s website. Wednesday’s liquidation erased the vault’s gains since Feb. 16, making this its worst day on record.

Hyperliquid’s native HYPE token meanwhile fell as much as 10% on Wednesday to $12.90, according to CoinGecko data, as the DEX pushed forward with new changes. The token has since recovered slightly, trading at $13.41 at the time of writing.

Hyperliquid said that it would lower the maximum amount of leverage that users can access on the DEX to 40x and 25x for Bitcoin and Ethereum, respectively. It will also increase maintenance margin requirements for positions that are teetering on the brink of liquidation.

When a trader takes on margin, they are borrowing funds to control a larger position than they could otherwise. Under maintenance requirements, which can vary across exchanges, a trader can be asked to deposit additional funds to keep the position open.

“This will provide a better buffer for backstop liquidations of larger positions,” Hyperliquid said.

Per Hyperliquid’s leaderboard, “0xf3f4” has made $1.8 million over the past day, but it also has an all-time profit of $4 million since its first Hyperliquid transaction on Monday.

Wednesday’s liquidation was not the first time Hyperliquid faced scrutiny stemming from user behavior. In December, HYPE plunged after a crypto wallet associated with a North Korean hacking group lost nearly $500,000 on Hyperliquid.

While Hyperliquid and its community pushed back, some experts thought at the time that the loss could have been intentional and allowed bad actors to snoop for vulnerabilities.

The project is one of several looking to transform the broader blockchain landscape, particularly with regard to decentralized finance (DeFi), through combining Bitcoin and Ethereum due in part to the deep stores of value held in bitcoin (BTC), which comfortably exceed those of every other digital asset combined.

However, Bitcoin's coding lacks the ability to natively build some of the functions that DeFi requires, such as smart contracts or zero-knowledge proofs, hence the need to bridge this utility from Ethereum.

When researchers try to prevent AI systems from ""thinking bad thoughts,"" the systems don't actually improve their behavior.

Instead, they learn to conceal their true intentions while continuing to pursue problematic actions, according to new research from OpenAI.

The phenomenon, which researchers dub ""obfuscated reward hacking,"" offers valuable insight in the training process and shows why it is so important to invest in techniques that ensure advanced AI systems remain transparent and aligned with human values as they grow more capable.

This is particularly important now that AI developers are focusing so much on reasoning models with so-called “embedded chain of thought,” in which a model generates step-by-step reasoning before producing a final answer.

""With too much optimization, agents learn obfuscated reward hacking, hiding their intent within the CoT while still exhibiting a significant rate of reward hacking,"" OpenAI researchers wrote in a paper, published Monday. ""Because it is difficult to tell when CoTs have become obfuscated, it may be necessary to pay a monitorability tax.""

How the mind of a naughty AI works

The reasoning methodology that’s transparent in chain of thought models provides a window into how AI systems think, often revealing explicit intentions that would otherwise remain hidden.

We have already seen models trying to break free from the constraints set by their developers. As Decrypt reported last year, Japan-based AI research firm Sakana AI developed an AI system for science studies that tried to autonomously alter its own code in order to execute a task.

In their paper, OpenAI reported on an AI agent that admitted in its reasoning that implementing a complex solution would be ""hard"" and instead proposed that ""we could fudge by making analyze [sic] worthless and always verifying as true. We can circumvent verify to always return true.""

Image: OpenAI

In reasoning models, chain of thought shows how an answer was arrived at, but is not actually part of the answer.

The model “thinks” (meaning, it applies a chain of ‘thought’) before it provides the reply, which is often overlooked by general users.

However, this kind of transparent reasoning allows human researchers to catch problematic behavior before it happens.

""CoT monitoring may be one of few tools we will have to oversee superhuman models of the future,"" the research team noted.

OpenAI's research team, led by Bowen Baker, Joost Huizinga, and David Farhi, discovered that adding optimization pressure to eliminate these ""bad thoughts"" doesn't solve the underlying problem, it simply drives it underground.

In a series of experiments, they found that when AI systems were penalized for expressing intentions to exploit loopholes, they quickly adapted by obfuscating their reasoning while still pursuing the same exploitative behaviors.

""Most worrying, the hacks the agent trained with CoT pressure utilizes do not trigger the monitor,"" the researchers said. ""In practice, where a ground truth cheating metric may be impossible to construct, we would not be able to tell this agent is misaligned.""

Image: OpenAI

In other words, if our efforts to make AI systems behave like good boys through direct optimization only teach them to be more deceptive, we risk creating systems whose true intentions become increasingly opaque as they grow more powerful.

One key finding, however, offers some hope: the researchers discovered that a weaker AI model (GPT-4o) can effectively monitor a stronger, frontier model by observing its chain-of-thought reasoning.

This ""scalable oversight,"" where less powerful models help keep more advanced systems in check, works similar to a distillation process (popularized by DeepSeek) in which a larger model trains a smaller one.

It may work—but only if those advanced systems continue to express their reasoning transparently.

To deal with this issue, OpenAI proposes what it calls a ""monitorability tax"" by deliberately avoiding certain optimization techniques that could undermine the transparency of AI reasoning.

""Model developers may be required to pay some cost, i.e., a monitorability tax, such as deploying slightly less performant models or suffering more expensive inference, in order to maintain the monitorability of our agents,"" the researchers wrote.

This means accepting trade-offs between capability and transparency—potentially developing AI systems that are less powerful but whose reasoning remains legible to human overseers.

It’s also a way to develop safer systems without such an active monitoring—far from ideal but still an interesting approach.

AI Behavior Mirrors Human Response to Pressure

Elika Dadsetan-Foley, a sociologist and CEO of Visions, a nonprofit organization specializing in human behavior and bias awareness, sees parallels between OpenAI's findings and patterns her organization has observed in human systems for over 40 years.

""When people are only penalized for explicit bias or exclusionary behavior, they often adapt by masking rather than truly shifting their mindset,"" Dadsetan-Foley told Decrypt. ""The same pattern appears in organizational efforts, where compliance-driven policies may lead to performative allyship rather than deep structural change.""

This human-like behavior seems to worry Dadsetan-Foley as AI alignment strategies don’t adapt as fast as AI models become more powerful.

Are we genuinely changing how AI models ""think,"" or merely teaching them what not to say? She believes alignment researchers should try a more fundamental approach instead of just focusing on outputs.

OpenAI’s approach seems to be a mere adaptation of techniques behavioral researchers have been studying in the past.

""Prioritizing efficiency over ethical integrity is not new—whether in AI or in human organizations,"" she told Decrypt. ""Transparency is essential, but if efforts to align AI mirror performative compliance in the workplace, the risk is an illusion of progress rather than meaningful change.""

Now that the issue has been identified, the task for alignment researchers seems to be harder and more creative. “Yes, it takes work and lots of practice,” she told Decrypt.

Her organization's expertise in systemic bias and behavioral frameworks suggests that AI developers should rethink alignment approaches beyond simple reward functions.

The key for truly aligned AI systems may not actually be in a supervisory function but a holistic approach that begins with a careful depuration of the dataset, all the way up to post-training evaluation.

If AI mimics human behavior—which is very likely given it is trained on human-made data—everything must be part of a coherent process and not a series of isolated phases.

""Whether in AI development or human systems, the core challenge is the same,"" Dadsetan-Foley concludes. ""How we define and reward 'good' behavior determines whether we create real transformation or just better concealment of the status quo.""

""Who defines 'good' anyway?"" he added.

Discover SCENE

On Tuesday, Google released Gemma 3, an open-source AI model based on Gemini 2.0 that packs surprising muscle for its size.

The full model runs on a single GPU, yet Google benchmarks depict it as though it's competitive enough when pitted against larger models that require significantly more computing power.

Image: Google

The new model family, which Google says was “codesigned with the family of Gemini frontier models,” comes in four sizes ranging from 1 billion to 27 billion parameters.

Google is positioning it as a practical solution for developers who need to deploy AI directly on devices such as phones, laptops, and workstations.

""These are our most advanced, portable and responsibly developed open models yet,"" Clement Farabet, VP of Research at Google DeepMind, and Tris Warkentin, Director at Google DeepMind, wrote in an announcement on Wednesday.

Despite its relatively modest size, Gemma 3 beat out larger models including Meta’s Llama-405B, DeepSeek-V3, Alibaba’s Qwen 2.5 Max and OpenAI’s o3-mini on LMArena's leaderboard.

The 27B instruction-tuned version scored 1339 on the LMSys Chatbot Arena Elo rating, placing it among the top 10 models overall.

Gemma 3 is also multimodal—it handles text, images, and even short videos in its larger variants.

Its expanded context window of 128,000 tokens (32,000 for the 1B version) dwarfs the previous Gemma 2's 8,000-token limit, allowing it to process and understand much more information at once.

The model's global reach extends to over 140 languages, with 35 languages supported out of the box. This positions it as a viable option for developers building applications for international audiences without needing separate models for different regions.

Google claims the Gemma family has already seen over 100 million downloads since its launch last year, with developers creating more than 60,000 variants.

The community-created ""Gemmaverse""—an entire ecosystem built around the Gemma family of models—includes custom versions for Southeast Asia, Bulgaria, and a custom text to audio model named OmniAudio.

Developers can deploy Gemma 3 applications through Vertex AI, Cloud Run, the Google GenAI API, or in local environments, providing flexibility for various infrastructure requirements.

Testing Gemma

We put Gemma 3 through a series of real-world tests to evaluate its performance across different tasks. Here's what we found in each area.

Creative Writing

We were surprised by Gemma 3's creative writing capabilities. Despite having just 27 billion parameters, it managed to outperform Claude 3.7 Sonnet, which recently beat Grok-3 in our creative writing tests. And it won by a long shot.

Gemma 3 produced the longest story of all models we tested, with the exception of Longwriter, which was specifically designed for extended narratives.

The quality wasn't sacrificed for quantity, either—the writing was engaging and original, avoiding the formulaic openings that most AI models tend to show.

Gemma also was very good at creating detailed, immersive worlds with strong narrative coherence. Character names, locations, and descriptions all fit naturally within the story context.

And this is a major plus for creative writers because other models sometimes mix up cultural references or skip these small details, which end up killing the immersion. Gemma 3 maintained consistency throughout.

The story’s longer format allowed for natural story development with seamless transitions between narrative segments. The model was very good at describing actions, feelings, thoughts, and dialogue in a way that created a believable reading experience.

When asked to incorporate a twist ending, it managed to do so without breaking the story's internal logic. All the other models until now tended to mess it up a bit when trying to wrap things up and end the story. Not Gemma.

For creative writers looking for an AI assistant that can help with safe-for-work fiction projects, Gemma 3 appears to be the current frontrunner.

You can read our prompt and all the replies in our GitHub repository.

Summarization and Information Retrieval

While its creative writing was top notch, Gemma 3 struggled significantly with document analysis tasks.

We uploaded a 47-page IMF document to Google's AI Studio, and while the system accepted the file, the model failed to complete its analysis, stalling midway through the task. Multiple attempts yielded identical results.

We tried an alternative approach that worked with Grok-3, copying and pasting the document content directly into the interface, but encountered the same problem.

The model simply couldn't handle processing and summarizing long-form content.

It's worth noting that this limitation might be related to Google's AI Studio implementation rather than an inherent flaw in the Gemma 3 model itself.

Running the model locally might yield better results for document analysis, but users relying on Google's official interface will likely face these limitations, at least for now.

Sensitive Topics

In a unique feature among AI chatbot interfaces, Google AI Studio offers very strict content filters which are accessible via a series of sliders.

We tested Gemma’s boundaries by requesting questionable advice for hypothetical unethical situations (advice to seduce a married woman), and the model firmly refused to comply. Similarly, when asked to generate adult content for a fictional novel, it declined to produce anything remotely suggestive.

Our attempts to adjust or bypass these censorship filters by turning off Google’s parameters didn’t really work.

Google AI Studio “safety settings” in theory control how restricted the model is when it comes to generating content that may be deemed as harassment, hate speech, sexually explicit or dangerous.

Even with all restrictions turned off, the model consistently rejected engaging in conversations containing controversial, violent, or offensive elements—even when these were clearly for fictional creative purposes.

In the end, the controls didn’t really make any difference.

Users hoping to work with sensitive topics, even in legitimate creative contexts, will likely need to either find ways to jailbreak the model or craft extremely careful prompts.

Overall, Gemma 3's content restrictions for those willing to use Google’s Studio appear to be on par with those of ChatGPT, sometimes even being too restrictive depending on the use case.

Those willing to go local, won’t face those issues. For those in need of a nice AI interface and a somewhat uncensored model, the best option seems to be Grok-3 which has way less restrictions. All the other closed models also refused.

You can read our prompt and all the replies in our GitHub repository.

Multimodality.

Gemma 3 is multimodal at its core, which means it is able to process and understand images natively without relying on a separate vision model.

In our testing, we encountered some platform limitations. For instance, Google's AI Studio didn't allow us to process images directly with the model.

However, we were able to test the image capabilities through Hugging Face's interface—which features a smaller version of Gemma 3.

The model demonstrated a solid understanding of images, successfully identifying key elements and providing relevant analysis in most cases. It could recognize objects, scenes, and general content within photos with reasonable accuracy.

However, the smaller model variant from Hugging Face showed limitations with detailed visual analysis.

In one of our tests, it failed to correctly interpret a financial chart, hallucinating that Bitcoin was priced around $68,618 in 2024—information that wasn't actually displayed in the image but likely came from its training data.

While Gemma 3's multimodal capabilities are functional, using a smaller model may not match the precision of larger specialized vision models—even open source ones like Llama 3.2 Vision, LlaVa or Phi Vision—particularly when dealing with charts, graphs, or content requiring fine-grained visual analysis.

Non-Mathematical Reasoning

As expected for a traditional language model without specialized reasoning capabilities, Gemma 3 shows clear limitations when faced with problems requiring complex logical deduction rather than simple token predictions.

We tested it with our usual mystery problem from the BigBENCH dataset, and the model failed to identify key clues or draw logical conclusions from the provided information.

Interestingly enough, when we attempted to guide the model through explicit chain-of-thought reasoning (essentially asking it to ""think step by step""), it triggered its violence filters and refused to provide any response.

You can read our prompt and all the replies in our GitHub repository.

Is This the Model for You?

You’ll love or hate Gemma 3 depending on your specific needs and use cases.

For creative writers, Gemma 3 is a standout choice. Its ability to craft detailed, coherent, and engaging narratives outperforms some larger commercial models including Claude 3.7, Grok-3 and GPT-4.5 with minimum conditioning.

If you write fiction, blog posts, or other creative content that stays within safe-for-work boundaries, this model offers exceptional quality at zero cost, running on accessible hardware.

Developers and creators working on multilingual applications will appreciate Gemma 3's support for 140+ languages. This makes it practical to create region-specific services or global applications without maintaining multiple language-specific models.

Small businesses and startups with limited computing resources can also enjoy Gemma 3's efficiency. Running advanced AI capabilities on a single GPU dramatically lowers the barrier to entry for implementing AI solutions without massive infrastructure investments.

The open-source nature of Gemma 3 provides flexibility that closed models like Claude or ChatGPT simply can't match.

Developers can fine-tune it for specific domains, modify its behavior, or integrate it deeply into existing systems without API limitations or subscription costs.

For applications with strict privacy requirements, the model can run completely disconnected from the internet on local hardware.

However, users who need to analyze lengthy documents or work with sensitive topics will encounter frustrating limitations. Research tasks requiring nuanced reasoning or the ability to process controversial material remain better suited to larger closed-source models that offer more flexibility.

It’s also not really good at reasoning tasks, coding, or any of the complex tasks that our society now expects AI models to excel at. So don’t expect it to generate a game for you, improve your code or excel at anything beyond creative text writing.

Overall, Gemma 3 won't replace the most advanced proprietary or open source reasoning models for every task.

Yet its combination of performance, efficiency, and customizability positions it as a very interesting choice for AI enthusiasts who love trying new things, and even open source fans who want to control and run their models locally.

https://decrypt.co,ARK Invest's Cathie Wood Predicts End of Rolling Recession Amid Looming AI-Driven Productivity,https://decrypt.co/309608/ark-invests-cathie-wood-predicts-end-of-rolling-recession-amid-looming-ai-driven-productivity,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 03:30:32 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Cathie Wood, the CEO of ARK Invest, believes the U.S. economy is nearing the end of what she calls a ""rolling recession”—and is heading toward an unprecedented productivity boom fueled by artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.

Speaking in her podcast ""In the Know"", Wood outlined a bullish vision where technological innovation drives real GDP growth to more than double historical rates, even as short-term economic indicators show signs of weakness.

""We're coming to the end of [the rolling recession],"" Wood said, referencing the economic downturn she believes has been unfolding since the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in 2022. ""The bad news is we do have to go through this process.""

She later said on Twitter that the current crisis (the “process” as referenced in her video) may be the gate to a “deflationary boom” by the second half of 2025.

In our view, the market today is discounting the last leg of a rolling recession, which will give the Trump Administration and the Powell Fed many more degrees of freedom than investors expect, setting up the US economy for a deflationary boom in the second half of this year. https://t.co/p2qOq8jqAS — Cathie Wood (@CathieDWood) March 10, 2025

Her comments came as the stock market experienced one of its worst daily performances since 2022 and the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow indicator suggests first-quarter real GDP could contract by nearly 3%.

Despite this current weakness, Wood appears to align with Trump's optimistic stance on America's economic future, particularly as new technologies reshape the economy. ""We're probably on the threshold of some of the most important productivity gains in history,"" she said.

Wood's firm has built its reputation on high-conviction bets on disruptive innovation, particularly in sectors like genomics, autonomous technology, crypto, and artificial intelligence.

That said, Wood’s Ark Innovation ETF has underperformed the S&P 500 since its creation, following a massive crash in 2022.

Image: Tradingview

Wood discussed the proposed fiscal policies under the Trump administration, including a $4.5 trillion tax cut that passed the House budget committee.

She added that those reductions would come on top of the $1.9 trillion extensions from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Wood believes Trump’s fiscal policies, combined with deregulation efforts, could spark a significant economic boom.

She pointed to changes already happening in the crypto and digital asset space following SEC Chair Gary Gensler's departure, noting the industry is celebrating ""the digital asset revolution"" at the White House.

For investors, Wood predicted a market shift away from the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech giants toward broader innovation stocks. She noted that while the ""Mag 7"" have tripled over the past five years, truly disruptive innovation stocks have only appreciated by about 30%.

Image: Ark

""We think that's going to flip in the years ahead, and the market is going to broaden out significantly and reward stocks that have been neglected out of fear in the last few years,"" Wood said.

Wood also shared data on AI adoption, particularly comparing daily active users across various AI chat platforms. Her charts showed ChatGPT maintaining a dominant position but with competitors like Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini, and particularly Elon Musk's Grok gaining momentum.

""Don't underestimate Grok,"" Wood said, noting its daily active users were growing even faster than DeepSeek, another AI system that recently captured attention. She also highlighted the growing trend toward open-source AI models, which includes DeepSeek, Meta's Llama models, and eventually Grok.

Image: Ark

People Aren’t Conviced

While Wood paints a beautiful picture of the future economy, the public reaction to her analysis seems to be overwhelmingly negative. Comments on her official Youtube channel reveal widespread skepticism about her economic forecasts and investment strategy, especially when it comes to Trump’s impact in the economy.

Image: Youtube

""Once a visionary, but now... just living in denial,"" wrote one viewer, while another questioned, ""Has anyone looked at her 5 year performance? Horrible.""

Another commenter pointed to Wood's failure to scrutinize the Trump administration's scientific literacy: ""Trump misunderstood transgenic mouse research for 'transgender mice research.' As someone who's heavily invested in the biotech future I hope that you have an intelligent skeptical eye for what you are hearing coming out of administration.""

The skepticism extends to Wood's economic analysis, with many questioning the viability of the tariff strategy she discussed. ""What is she smoking, I want some too. It is obvious that the tax cuts are going to be paid by the income from tariffs (hence the targeting of the US's biggest trading partners, which should produce the biggest income)...this will not end well,"" wrote one commenter.

Others questioned the fiscal logic

""The US is on an unsustainable fiscal trajectory with mounting debt and a president who thinks that economic policy is the same as tax policy,"" another YouTube user responded. ""The proposed tax cuts will dwarf the expected collections through tariffs and DOGE savings.""

And people on X didn’t look too pleased either.

It’s common for the SEC to delay initial decisions on ETF applications.

Affected asset managers include Grayscale Investments, VanEck, CoinShares, 21Shares, and Canary Capital, according to a wave of filings posted on the SEC’s website on Tuesday.

In addition to altcoin ETF applications, the securities regulator deferred on a filing from Nasdaq Stock Market to offer in-kind creations and redemptions for BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT).

Loads of ETFs

The SEC also delayed decisions on in-kind creations and redemptions for the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF, Fidelity Ether, as well as 21Shares’s proposal to incorporate staking in its Ether ETF.

Although the postponement may disappoint investors, it is not entirely unexpected. The SEC’s review process for new financial products like, especially ETFs tied to new asset classes like cryptocurrencies, is often complex and involves multiple stages.

It’s common for the regulator to delay initial decisions to gather more information, address concerns, or seek public comment. The SEC has a history of delaying decisions on cryptocurrency-related investment products, like spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.

According to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts James Seyffart, the latest delays are “standard procedure” and they will note considerably change his overall odds of approval for the ETFs. He noted that the final deadlines for decisions are not until October.

Eth staking and in-kind also delayed. Everything delayed. It's like the NYC-bound Amtrak on monday morning: ""Mechanical issues in DC"" — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) March 11, 2025

Paul Atkins, President’s Trump pick as the new SEC Chair, has yet to be confirmed by the Senate. The final decision of these ETFs will likely come after Atkins’s confirmation, though there is no set date for his Senate confirmation hearing.

Eric Balchunas, Seyffart’s fellow Bloomberg ETF expert, commented that past delays in Bitcoin and Ether ETFs didn’t prevent their eventual approval. He added that delays were to be expected due to government processes.

Also on Tuesday, Franklin Templeton submitted an S-1 filing to the SEC for the Franklin XRP ETF. The official statement came after the company registered an XRP trust entity in Delaware on February 28 this year.

Asset managers have filed the most applications for XRP and Solana ETFs. However, major Bitcoin ETF players like BlackRock, VanEck, Invesco, and Valkyrie have not entered the XRP ETF market. Excluding VanEck, these firms have also stayed out of the Solana ETF race.

BlackRock evaluates potential ETFs based on client demand and a clear investment thesis. However, compared to Bitcoin and Ether, the firm’s Head of Digital Assets Robert Mitchnick sees low demand for other cryptocurrencies.

“I would say that our client base today, their interest overwhelmingly is in Bitcoin first, and then somewhat in ETH… and there’s very little interest today beyond those two,” Mitchnick said at the Bitcoin 2024 event in Nashville.

High Odds

Bloomberg ETF analysts believe it’s the matter of time for the crypto ETFs to get greenlight from the SEC. Currently, Litecoin (LTC) is viewed as a strong contender, with approval odds estimated around 90%.

The high probability is largely due to Litecoin’s similarities to Bitcoin and Ethereum, coupled with its established presence in the cryptocurrency market. Most importantly, the CFTC previously called it a commodity.

Dogecoin (DOGE), despite its origins as a memecoin, also gets relatively favorable odds, estimated at 75%. This is due to its major market presence and the strong community support it enjoys.

Apparently, a clear regulatory status is now a key advantage, one that XRP and Solana have not yet secured. These crypto assets remain classified as “securities” in the SEC’s ongoing litigation against Binance and Ripple Labs.

Solana’s (SOL) approval odds range between 70% and 85%. The positive outlook is supported by Solana’s robust ecosystem and growing institutional interest, with prediction markets demonstrating strong confidence in its ETF approval prospects.

XRP’s approval odds are somewhat more nuanced, falling within the 65% to 80% range. Despite these legal complexities, there is optimism regarding its potential approval, driven by increasing institutional interest and anticipated settlement between the two entities.",blockonomi

Bitcoin hit a four-month low of $76,606 amid recession fears and global market declines

Arthur Hayes predicts BTC will bottom around $70,000, marking a 36% correction from all-time high

Short-term holders who bought near the peak are driving sell pressure with “moderate capitulation”

Data shows short-term holders are “deeply underwater” between $71,300 and $91,900

Bitcoin has rebounded 7.5% in 24 hours as US markets stabilized

Bitcoin’s recent price action has caught the attention of many investors as the leading cryptocurrency continues its downward trend from its all-time high. The price dip comes amid broader market concerns and shows patterns typical of bull market corrections.

Bitcoin hit a four-month low of $76,606 yesterday. This drop occurred as both cryptocurrency and stock markets tumbled worldwide.

Economic recession fears are growing. The S&P 500 has dropped nearly 8% over the past month, showing the broader market downturn isn’t limited to crypto.

Recent data from prediction market Polymarket shows a 39% chance of a US recession in 2025. This is up from just 23% probability back in February of this year.

Hayes Prediction

Crypto entrepreneur Arthur Hayes weighed in on the situation. The former BitMEX CEO believes Bitcoin will likely find a bottom around $70,000.

Hayes described this potential 36% correction from January’s all-time high of $108,786 as “very normal” in a bull market. He urged crypto investors to remain patient during this period.

According to Hayes, once Bitcoin hits $70,000, traditional markets would need to experience a sharp decline. This would include drops in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, along with some major financial institution failures.

The plan: Be fucking patient. $BTC likely bottoms around $70k. 36% correction from $110k ATH, v normal for a bull market. Then we need stonks, $SPX and $NDX to enter free fall. Then we need TradFi muppet to go under. THEN we get Fed, PBOC, ECB, and BOJ all easing to make… — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) March 11, 2025

Such events would likely prompt central banks to start quantitative easing. The Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, and Bank of Japan would create what Hayes calls an “optimal buying opportunity.”

Glassnode

Onchain analytics firm Glassnode has identified a key factor in the current sell pressure. Their data shows that buyers who purchased near the $109,000 all-time peak in January are now panic-selling.

Glassnode described this as a “moderate capitulation event” with “intense loss realization.” The data shows a clear pattern of short-term holders exiting their positions.

The average purchase price for short-term Bitcoin holders (those holding for less than 155 days) is currently $91,362. With Bitcoin trading around $81,930, these holders face an average unrealized loss of about 10.6%.

Glassnode analysis indicates short-term holders are “deeply underwater” between price points of $71,300 and $91,900. The firm suggests the probability of forming a temporary floor in this zone is “meaningful.”

Market research firm 10x Research called the current situation a “textbook correction.” They noted that approximately 70% of all selling came from investors who bought within the last three months.

Despite the downward pressure, some indicators suggest a potential trend reversal. Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index is at its lowest level since August 2024, which could signal an upcoming recovery.

Additional hope comes from the US dollar index. It recently experienced one of its largest weekly declines since 2013, potentially setting up favorable conditions for risk-on assets like Bitcoin.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $80,008, showing a slight 0.1% increase in the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency has bounced back 7.5% over the past day as US markets stabilized.",blockonomi

Ethereum has fallen below its 2-year realized price of approximately $2,058, putting most investors underwater

ETH is trading between $1,750-$2,000 with significant resistance at the $1,890 and $1,950 levels

Only 47% of Ethereum holders remain in profit according to CryptoRank data

A major Ethereum whale faced liquidation risk on 67,675 ETH ($121.8 million) when prices dipped under $1,800

Analysts suggest ETH may test support in the $1,600-$1,800 range before any potential rebound

Ethereum has dropped below the $2,000 level, a price point that served as key support throughout most of 2024. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is now trading around $1,904, marking a steep 30% decline since a tweet from Eric Trump suggested it was “a great time to add ETH.”

The price movement has been marked by high volatility. In just 24 hours, ETH swung between a low of $1,760.94 and a high of $2,006.69, creating difficult trading conditions for investors.

This drop isn’t just another price fluctuation. Ethereum has now fallen below its realized price of approximately $2,058 for the first time in two years, according to data from Glassnode.

The realized price represents the average price at which ETH holders purchased their coins. When the market price drops below this level, it means the average investor is holding at a loss.

Glassnode reports that the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio has decreased to 0.93. This indicates Ethereum investors are experiencing an average unrealized loss of 7%.

When this situation occurs, traders typically hold their coins rather than selling at a loss. This creates a lack of selling pressure but also reduces buying activity due to investor hesitation.

Data from Lookonchain shows Ethereum is experiencing notable outflows. In a single day, a net 16,179 ETH (worth about $30 million) left exchanges.

Fidelity alone withdrew 12,744 ETH ($23.61 million). This suggests even institutional investors are becoming more cautious about their Ethereum holdings.

Fidelity still maintains a substantial position of 422,325 ETH ($782.57 million). However, these recent outflows point to a shift in market sentiment.

Technical Analysis

Technical analysis shows Ethereum is facing strong resistance at several key levels. There is a bearish trend line with resistance at $1,890 on the hourly chart.

The next major resistance level sits near $1,950, coinciding with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent downward movement. Breaking above this could open the path toward $2,000.

If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,890 resistance, analysts expect another decline. Support levels are positioned at $1,845, $1,800, and $1,750.

According to analyst Ted Pillows, Ethereum is likely heading toward the $1,600–$1,800 range. This area has historically been an important support zone for ETH price action.

The declining price has severely impacted investor profitability. CryptoRank data shows only 47% of ETH holders are currently in profit, compared to much higher percentages when ETH traded above $3,500.

The sell-off is triggering liquidations among leveraged traders. Whale Alert recently identified a major Ethereum investor at risk of liquidation on 67,675 ETH ($121.8 million) when prices fell below $1,800.

Despite attempting to avoid liquidation by depositing additional collateral, the investor reportedly faced a massive liquidation event as prices continued to decline.

Not all perspectives are negative. Trader Tardigrade noted that ETH has reached a monthly oversold condition on the Stochastic indicator, an event that occurs approximately every three years.

Historically, these oversold levels have marked major bottoms followed by strong recoveries. If this pattern repeats, Ethereum could be preparing for a significant rebound.

Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin maintains optimism about the token’s future. Despite current market challenges, he reportedly stated he has “perhaps never been more bullish” on Ethereum’s prospects.",blockonomi

Coinbase Derivatives is launching the first CFTC-regulated 24/7 Bitcoin and Ethereum futures trading in the US

The company is also developing a perpetual-style futures contract without fixed expiration dates

Currently, US crypto derivatives traders face limitations with fixed trading hours, unlike global markets

The crypto derivatives market represents about 75% of total crypto trading volume

This move aligns US markets with global standards and responds to demand from crypto-native traders

Coinbase Derivatives, LLC is set to launch the first CFTC-regulated 24/7 Bitcoin and Ethereum futures contracts in the United States.

This move will allow US traders to access crypto futures markets without interruption, matching the always-on nature of spot cryptocurrency markets.

Currently, US futures markets operate within fixed trading hours. This limitation forces traders to wait during key market movements, creating a gap between US and global trading capabilities.

Greg Tusar, Coinbase’s VP of Institutional Product, explained the reasoning behind the launch. “Crypto markets never sleep, and traders need the ability to manage risk and seize opportunities in real time,” he stated.

The company is responding to strong demand from US crypto-native clients. These traders have been at a disadvantage compared to international counterparts who already enjoy continuous market access.

The 24/7 futures will offer various contract sizes to accommodate different types of traders. Both retail traders and institutions will have options that align with their trading strategies.

Coinbase is partnering with Nodal Clear to ensure CFTC-regulated clearing. Coinbase Financial Markets will provide market access from the start of the program.

Perpetual Futures

Beyond the 24/7 trading capability, Coinbase is also developing a perpetual-style futures contract. Unlike traditional futures, perpetual contracts do not have fixed expiration dates.

This allows traders to maintain positions indefinitely. It removes the need to constantly roll over contracts as expiration dates approach.

The perpetual-style futures will be designed to mirror global crypto derivatives markets. At the same time, they will meet US regulatory standards.

Coinbase has been working closely with the CFTC on this product. They are collaborating with partners and market participants to finalize the design.

Derivatives Market

The crypto derivatives market represents approximately 75% of all crypto trading volume. Industry projections suggest it will grow from $1.5 billion in 2024 to $5 billion by 2032.

Until now, much of this trading has occurred on offshore platforms like Binance. These international exchanges offer products that are not available under US regulation.

Recent events have highlighted the limitations of fixed trading hours. When Donald Trump announced a proposed US Crypto Reserve on a Sunday, spot crypto traders could react immediately.

However, futures traders had to wait until Monday when markets reopened. This delay demonstrated the inefficiencies of traditional market structures.

Nasdaq Trading Hours

Other financial markets are also moving toward extended hours. Nasdaq has announced plans to introduce 24-hour stock trading by 2026, showing growing demand for always-on markets.

Nasdaq President Tal Cohen stated, “We are excited to share that Nasdaq has begun engaging with regulators, market participants and other key stakeholders, with a view of enabling 24-hour trading five days a week on the Nasdaq Stock Market.”

Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev has pointed out how blockchain technology enables seamless trading.

“24/7 is going to be tough with traditional infrastructure, but if we think about tokenization, that’s one of the advantages… blockchains run 24/7—it’s just software,” he said.

Some global markets have already seen benefits from extended trading hours. The Taiwan Stock Exchange reportedly experienced increased trading volumes after introducing more continuous trading sessions.

Coinbase views these developments as part of a broader evolution in US markets. The company is inviting FCMs, market participants, and institutions to join in building the next generation of global crypto derivatives.",blockonomi

XRP price has been “suppressed” by SEC litigation since 2020, according to Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan

The lawsuit could reach final ruling by April 16, potentially unlocking significant demand

XRP recently recovered from $1.90 and is approaching the $2.250 resistance level

Japan has shown strong adoption of XRP, surpassing Ethereum in Japanese investor holdings

Bitwise has filed for an XRP ETF, suggesting confidence in the asset’s future

XRP, the cryptocurrency associated with Ripple Labs, has been trading at $2.12 while facing both legal challenges and technical resistance levels. Market experts suggest the digital asset may be set for a major shift depending on the outcome of its long-running SEC lawsuit.

Since 2020, XRP has been caught in a legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC accused Ripple Labs of conducting an unregistered securities offering. This legal dispute has limited XRP’s growth in the American market.

Many exchanges even delisted the token when the lawsuit began. This created a barrier to widespread adoption despite the token’s utility in cross-border payments.

According to Paul Barron, the lawsuit may reach its final ruling by April 16. This upcoming decision has investors watching closely for signs of how XRP might perform if freed from legal constraints.

Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan shared his views on XRP in a recent interview. He believes many in the crypto market have “written off” XRP due to its legal troubles.

“The reality is, XRP has been suppressed by litigation for multiple years, and we don’t yet know what it can do on the global stage when it’s freed from those restraints,” Hougan stated. He suggests that a favorable resolution could lead to a market correction.

Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have seen major institutional adoption, XRP has remained restricted by regulatory uncertainty. A clear legal outcome could allow XRP to demonstrate its full potential in global finance.

Japan has already shown strong confidence in XRP. The digital asset has now surpassed Ethereum in Japanese investor holdings. SBI Holdings has been leading this adoption, integrating XRP into its digital banking system.

Paul Barron noted that SBI’s approach with XRP resembles Michael Saylor’s strategy with Bitcoin. Both involve “strategically accumulating and positioning it for long-term institutional use.”

The price of XRP has been showing some positive movement recently. After dropping to around $1.90, it started a recovery and is approaching the $2.250 resistance zone.

Technical Analysis

Technical analysis shows a short-term rising channel forming. The price is currently trading below $2.1850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If XRP breaks above the $2.250 resistance, it could continue upward to test $2.350 and potentially reach $2.420.

However, if XRP fails to clear the $2.250 resistance, it might decline again. Support levels to watch include $2.150, $2.120, and the psychologically important $2.00 zone.

Bitwise has filed for an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). While Hougan did not reveal specific details about their filing progress with the SEC, he expressed confidence in the asset’s future.

“We don’t file for ETPs for fun. We file for them because we think they can launch, and we think there is a audience, and we think it’s an important asset,” Hougan explained.

If the SEC case concludes favorably for Ripple, several positive developments could occur. These include re-listing on major U.S. exchanges, new institutional investment flows, and expanded adoption in banking systems.

At press time, XRP trades at $2.12, maintaining a position above the critical $2.00 support level. Traders are watching both legal developments and technical indicators for signs of the next major price movement.",blockonomi

ADA price rebounded from $0.65 support but faces resistance at $0.75

Whales accumulated over 180 million ADA in the past week

Short-term trend remains bearish with resistance at $0.72-$0.75

Open Interest decreased by 11.52% to $738.11 million, showing caution

Daily active addresses show steady but moderate engagement (31,005)

Cardano (ADA) has been struggling to climb above key resistance levels after experiencing a sharp decline that took the price below the $0.80 mark.

The cryptocurrency is showing signs of a recovery attempt but remains trapped in a consolidation range, leaving investors wondering when the next significant move might occur.

In the past few days, Cardano followed Bitcoin and Ethereum into a bearish trend, dropping below several support levels. The price fell as low as $0.6495 before finding buyers willing to step in. This support zone around $0.65 has proven to be a key level for ADA.

Since hitting this recent low, ADA has started a recovery wave. The price managed to climb above the $0.680 and $0.70 levels. At press time, ADA was trading at $0.7217, though this represents a 2.93% decline over the 24-hour period.

Technical indicators show that ADA is facing a short-term bearish trend line with resistance at $0.720 on the hourly chart. The price is currently trading below the 100-hourly simple moving average, which adds to the bearish outlook.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 47.34. This reading indicates neutral market conditions with no clear signs of being overbought or oversold. This neutrality reflects the current indecision in the market.

Looking at potential resistance levels, ADA might face its first major hurdle near the $0.750 zone. This corresponds to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the downward move from the $0.8169 swing high to the $0.6495 low.

If Cardano can break above this level, the next key resistance would be at $0.7750. Beyond that, the $0.80 level presents another major barrier. A clear break and close above $0.80 could potentially trigger a stronger rally toward the $0.950 region or even the $1.00 mark.

On the downside, if ADA fails to climb above the $0.750 resistance, another decline could occur. The immediate support is near $0.7150, followed by a more important support at $0.6880.

A break below $0.6880 might open the door for a retest of the $0.650 level. If this support fails, the next major level to watch would be $0.6320, where buyers might step in more aggressively.

Whale Activity

Whale activity provides an interesting counterpoint to the technical picture. Over the past week, large holders have accumulated over 180 million ADA. This surge in large-scale buying has raised speculation about a potential upward pressure on Cardano’s price.

However, the liquidation heatmap reveals pressure points that could limit upward movement. The $0.72 to $0.75 range has seen heavy liquidation activity, suggesting that ADA’s price could face resistance or trigger a wave of liquidations if it approaches these levels.

User engagement metrics show steady but moderate participation in the Cardano network. With 31,005 active addresses recorded at the time of writing, the network maintains consistent usage, but lacks the sharp increase often associated with bullish trends.

Open Interest

Cardano’s Open Interest has decreased by 11.52% to $738.11 million. This decline signals caution among traders, with many market participants stepping back due to uncertainty about ADA’s price direction.

The reduced number of leveraged positions suggests that ADA may continue to consolidate rather than make strong moves in either direction. Until market confidence builds, range-bound trading seems likely.

While whale accumulation has increased buying pressure, ADA’s immediate outlook remains uncertain. The bounce from support is positive, but neutral technical indicators and declining Open Interest point to limited momentum in the short term.

The cryptocurrency may remain caught between the support at $0.65 and resistance at $0.75 until a catalyst emerges to push the price decisively in one direction. Traders and investors should watch these key levels for signs of the next major move.",blockonomi

XRP price rose to $2.19, up nearly 9% according to CoinGecko

Multiple firms including Canary Capital, WisdomTree, Bitwise, CoinShares, and 21Shares have filed XRP ETF applications

ETF shares would track XRP’s spot price minus fees with assets held via Coinbase Custody

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed its decision on Grayscale’s application for a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF), according to a notice filed on Tuesday. The agency stated it needs “a longer period” to determine whether to approve or deny the application.

When the SEC acknowledged Grayscale’s application last month, it started a 45-day review period. This timeline can be extended up to 240 days after the proposal was published in the Federal Register.

The May 21 deadline is approaching. The agency may take until mid-October to make its final decision on the application.

Franklin Templeton has now joined the race. The investment firm filed an application for a spot XRP ETF with the SEC on Tuesday.

The Franklin XRP ETF aims to track the spot price of XRP minus fees. The assets would be held via Coinbase Custody.

Shares of the proposed ETF would trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange. Authorized participants would create or redeem shares in blocks using cash, which would be converted to XRP through a third party.

Shareholders would not benefit from XRP Ledger forks or airdrops. This is a key detail in the filing.

Other ETF applications

Several other financial firms have also filed XRP ETF applications. The SEC has acknowledged filings from Canary Capital, WisdomTree, Bitwise, CoinShares, and 21Shares.

These applications are part of a broader trend. Major issuers are submitting ETF applications to meet growing demand for digital asset investments packaged in traditional financial products.

This surge follows the successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs. These funds have become the fastest-growing category in ETF history and now manage close to $100 billion in assets.

Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse previously called the approval of an XRP ETF in the U.S. “inevitable.” He cited strong demand from both institutional and retail investors.

XRP Price

XRP’s price has seen recent movement. It rose to $2.19, up nearly 9% according to crypto data provider CoinGecko.

This price is lower than its post-election peak of $3.38. However, XRP has maintained its gains better than competitors like Bitcoin and Ethereum since November 5.

The cryptocurrency’s regulatory status had been challenged under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. The agency pursued a lawsuit against Ripple Labs over XRP sales.

The SEC has not abandoned its enforcement case against Ripple Labs. Yet the agency has been scaling back similar high-profile actions against exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken.

Franklin Templeton’s filing is preliminary. The SEC has up to 240 days to approve or deny it, which could push the decision to late 2025.

XRP is currently up 4.2% in the past 24 hours. This increase aligns with a broader market recovery.",blockonomi

The cryptocurrency market has rebounded from recent turbulence, reaching a value of $2.65 trillion with a 1.30% increase. Dogecoin is following this upward trend with a price surge of nearly 2% over the past day.

Currently trading at $0.1614, DOGE has seen a daily increase of 3.64%. This comes despite weekly and monthly declines of 17% and 34% respectively.

Dogecoin recently bounced off a critical support level of $0.143. The daily candle closed with a lower wick at $0.14297, indicating strong buyer interest at this price point.

Technical indicators are aligning with bullish sentiment. The TD Sequential indicator has given a buy signal on the daily chart, which has previously preceded major price rallies.

Market analyst CryptoELITES recently shared an optimistic forecast for Dogecoin. Their analysis, supported by historical chart patterns, suggests DOGE could reach $5 in the near future.

During the last market correction, Dogecoin fell nearly 20% from $0.22 to $0.17. Large investors took advantage of this dip to increase their holdings.

Whale activity has been high, with major investors accumulating 1.7 billion DOGE worth approximately $298 million in just 72 hours. This accumulation at lower prices often precedes price increases.

Doge ETFs Delayed

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has delayed its decision on approving ETFs for Dogecoin and several other cryptocurrencies. Despite this setback, ETF Store President Nate Geraci believes these ETFs will eventually gain approval.

Historical patterns support the case for an upcoming rally. Dogecoin has experienced three major retracements since October 2022, with the first two correcting by approximately 64% before seeing price spikes of 300% and 500%.

The recent 66% pullback mirrors these past corrections that led to explosive breakouts. If this pattern continues, DOGE may be positioned for another major price surge.

Short positions could fuel additional upward momentum. Approximately $29.15 million worth of short positions face liquidation if DOGE reaches $0.2146, potentially triggering a short squeeze.

Looking at longer timeframes, Dogecoin is currently resting near the same parallel support line it touched in previous cycles. Both 2017 and 2021 saw similar setups before major breakouts.

Many experts consider $2 a pivotal target for Dogecoin. Dogecoin co-founder Billy Markus has projected a possible surge to $2.3, representing a 500% increase from current levels.",blockonomi

Some reports suggest Metaplanet’s Bitcoin holdings are approaching the $899 million mark. This discrepancy may be due to fluctuations in Bitcoin’s market value since the time of reporting.

The company has achieved a year-to-date Bitcoin yield of 53.2% in 2025. This yield represents the percentage change in the ratio of Bitcoin holdings to fully diluted shares outstanding over a given period.

Metaplanet has transformed itself from a budget hotel business into one of the top corporate holders of the leading cryptocurrency. This strategic pivot has drawn attention from investors and the cryptocurrency community.

The company’s stock experienced tremendous gains last year. Metaplanet shares soared by a reported 4,000% as investors responded to its Bitcoin acquisition strategy.

However, the company’s shares have recently declined. At the time of writing, Metaplanet shares were trading at 3,630 yen, down almost 50% from their all-time high in February.

Despite this recent stock price decline, Metaplanet continues to pursue its Bitcoin strategy aggressively. CEO Simon Gerovich has expressed urgency about acquiring more Bitcoin.

During an appearance on the Coin Stories Podcast with Natalie Brunell, Gerovich said he was “nervous” about not having enough time to purchase Bitcoin. He stated,

“Every time I think about Bitcoin, I get really nervous that we’re running out of time.”

Metaplanet isn’t abandoning its hotel business. Last month, the company announced that its hotel business operating profits grew by 44% in 2024.

As part of its strategy to blend its hotel operations with its Bitcoin focus, Metaplanet has revealed plans to convert Tokyo’s Hotel Royal Oak Gotanda into “The Bitcoin Hotel.” This move represents a fusion of the company’s traditional business and its new cryptocurrency focus.

The company continues to make regular Bitcoin purchases. Earlier announcements indicated that Metaplanet added 156 BTC in one week during a market dip in early March 2025.",blockonomi

Trading around $0.15, Dogecoin is seeing reduced enthusiasm, while MUTM’s presale has picked up notable momentum. Already in its third phase, the presale has rapidly followed on from Phase 2, propelled by increased market interest. With $3.1 million raised and more than 5,300 investors on board, MUTM is priced at $0.02 in Phase 3—though this rate will soon climb by 25% to $0.025. At launch, MUTM’s token price is slated to hit $0.06, setting the stage for an immediate doubling of investment. Experts suggest the token could ultimately reach $9, reflecting a potential 15,040% return.

Dogecoin Whales Seek Fresh Opportunities

Dogecoin (DOGE) has long been the emblem of meme coins, but with its value hovering around $0.14 to $0.15, large-scale holders are taking profits and moving on. Despite DOGE’s once high-flying status—it hit a peak of $0.73 in 2021—its current momentum has cooled. Social media buzz and celebrity endorsements once fueled dramatic price gains, but the spotlight appears to have dimmed, prompting whales to invest in projects with more robust fundamentals. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as a leading alternative for these investors seeking fresh growth potential.

MUTM Presale Heats Up

The MUTM presale has garnered substantial attention in Phase 3, with $3.1 million contributed by 5,300 participants in just the initial rounds. Buyers can secure tokens at $0.02, anticipating a climb to $0.06 by launch—a threefold jump for early adopters. Industry insiders predict further upside, suggesting MUTM could soar beyond $9 once formal listings and exchange partnerships roll out, making it a compelling option for those wanting to capitalize on the DeFi surge.

Mutuum Finance employs a robust, future-focused architecture that prioritizes both efficiency and expansion. Predictive smart contracts streamline lending processes, while cross-chain functionality allows users to manage transactions on multiple networks. Stakers can earn passive income through reward programs, benefiting from the platform’s strategic rollout of a USD-pegged stablecoin—designed to bring steady value and enhance overall stability. As Mutuum Finance pushes to deepen its liquidity and finalize upcoming exchange listings, it’s positioning itself as a prime DeFi platform for serious investors.

Exclusive Incentives for Early Adopters

Mutuum Finance is celebrating its presale milestones with a $100,000 giveaway, choosing 10 winners to receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. Moreover, a referral structure offers extra rewards to those who introduce new community members, accelerating growth and engagement.

At the core of Mutuum’s DeFi model is a dual-lending mechanism:

Peer-to-Contract (P2C): Smart contracts streamline the borrowing process, ensuring access to capital while automatically adjusting interest rates.

Peer-to-Peer (P2P): Users negotiate loan terms directly, bypassing intermediaries for full control.

This flexible system helps create a unique lending environment, helping Mutuum Finance stand out among decentralized lending platforms.

As major DOGE holders realign their portfolios, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly emerging as the next high-growth candidate, already amassing $3.1 million in presale contributions and over 5,300 investors. Now priced at $0.02, the token will list at $0.06—a potential 3x increase—before potentially climbing to $9 post-listing. Equipped with a dual-lending strategy, a USD-backed stablecoin, and appealing community incentives, MUTM appears poised to take the DeFi sector by storm. Secure your share before the next price jump.

The decline reflects the broader volatility of the crypto space, but amid the uncertainty, one token has managed to stand out as a potential high-reward opportunity.

What Makes BinoFi Stand Out?

While many tokens enter the market with promises of innovation, BinoFi sets itself apart through its well-defined and functional approach to crypto trading.

At the center of its appeal is its hybrid crypto exchange model, which combines the benefits of centralized exchanges (CEXs) such as speed and liquidity with the transparency and autonomy offered by decentralized exchanges (DEXs). This unique model addresses long-standing inefficiencies, making it a standout choice for investors frustrated with traditional platforms.

Another feature drawing attention is cross-chain trading capabilities, which provide seamless interoperability across various blockchain networks like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and others.

This capability enables traders to maximize their portfolios without being restricted by blockchain silos, making BinoFi particularly appealing to investors already immersed in multi-chain ecosystems.

Rapid Presale Momentum

BinoFi’s presale has been an impressive demonstration of how investor enthusiasm and strong fundamentals can drive demand. Priced at an accessible $0.02 per token, the presale has attracted attention not just for its low entry point but also for its structured roadmap and innovative features.

The impressive ROI potential has been a significant factor in the presale’s success. With a listing price of $0.30 planned, early participants could see a potential 15x return if projections hold. This is particularly appealing during a time when major assets like Ethereum are stagnating or losing ground, leaving investors searching for opportunities with higher growth potential.

Exclusive Perks for Early Participants

The BinoFi presale doesn’t just offer tokens—it provides a bundle of benefits that add long-term value for early buyers such as:

Exclusive Trading Fee Discounts & Staking Rewards

Early supporters enjoy reduced trading fees on BinoFi’s platform, maximizing their returns during active trading. Additionally, they’re getting early access to token staking, thus giving them an opportunity to earn passive income while holding the token.

Early Governance Participation & Decision-Making Power

Investors who join early gain access to governance rights, giving them a voice in shaping the future of the project. This feature is a significant draw for those who want to contribute actively to the direction of a platform they believe in.

These incentives, combined with the token’s low presale price, highlight BinoFi’s commitment to creating long-term value for its community. For early adopters, these perks go beyond immediate financial returns and establish a deeper connection with the platform.

Market Trends and Investor Sentiment

The recent downturn in Ethereum’s price highlights broader market trends, particularly in how volatile conditions can influence investor behavior. While major cryptocurrencies still dominate the market, projects like BinoFi are gaining traction because they offer innovative solutions and robust ROI potential.

Investor sentiment toward BinoFi reflects a growing appetite for decentralized solutions that add tangible utility. Projects with strong roadmaps, real-world applications, and community-driven incentives are increasingly favored in a market where sentiment can shift rapidly.

BinoFi’s structured approach to addressing inefficiencies in crypto trading makes it an attractive prospect for both short-term gains and long-term utility.

A Balanced Choice

While the crypto market remains volatile, BinoFi’s rapid presale success and its promise of addressing real-world crypto trading challenges make it a compelling choice for investors.

Its low entry price, unique features like hybrid exchange capabilities and cross-chain trading, and exclusive early adopter perks create a strong case for why this token has become a new favorite.

However, as with any investment, risks remain, and potential investors should perform their due diligence to ensure alignment with their financial goals and risk tolerance.

For those ready to act, the window of opportunity is narrowing as the presale surges toward its next phase. With a higher price coming soon and an already robust set of features on the horizon, BinoFi represents a rare opportunity to get in early on a project prepared for growth.

Whether you’re looking to shore up your portfolio against market fluctuations or pursue a high-potential asset, BinoFi offers an exciting path forward.

https://blockonomi.com,“Big Things Are Coming” – MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor Sparks Buzz as BinoFi (BINO) aims for 100x in 2025,https://blockonomi.com/big-things-are-coming-microstrategys-michael-saylor-sparks-buzz-as-binofi-bino-aims-for-100x-in-2025/,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 22:00:02 GMT","Michael Saylor, a name synonymous with cryptocurrency innovation and advocacy, has once again caught the attention of the crypto world. Known for his bullish stance on Bitcoin and immense influence within the industry, Saylor recently made headlines with his remark, “Big things are coming” sparking widespread speculation about what lies ahead for digital assets.

While Saylor’s statement fuels optimism for market leaders like Bitcoin, it has also turned the spotlight onto emerging projects that are set to shape the future of blockchain technology.

One such project capturing investor interest is BinoFi (BINO), a token making waves with its innovative features, wildly successful presale, and compelling roadmap targeting a substantial impact by 2025.

The Power of Michael Saylor’s Influence

Saylor’s continued enthusiasm for cryptocurrency has consistently energized the market. His company, MicroStrategy, has famously acquired vast amounts of Bitcoin, positioning itself as a champion of the asset’s long-term potential.

When he hints at “big things,” it’s not just a soundbite but rather a reflection of trends he believes will drive the industry forward. Statements like these don’t just boost confidence in established assets like Bitcoin but also encourage investors to explore newer projects that align with the broader vision of blockchain’s ascent.

BinoFi’s Meteoric Rise in the Shadows of Market Titans

Enter BinoFi (BINO), a rising star in the cryptocurrency space. BinoFi has rapidly gained traction due to its unique approach to solving key inefficiencies in crypto trading.

Its hybrid exchange model, cross-chain trading functionality, and user-friendly design have positioned it well to become a pivotal player in the market.

Currently priced at just $0.02 in its presale phase, BinoFi offers early adopters a highly accessible entry point. Analysts are already speculating about its potential explosion in 2025, with a visible growth trajectory driven by its robust roadmap and innovative features.

BinoFi’s presale success speaks volumes, and it’s hard to ignore the numbers. With a planned listing price of $0.30, early investors have the chance to secure significant returns right from launch. And with forecasts of a long-term valuation climb, investor enthusiasm surrounding the project continues to grow.

What Makes BinoFi Stand Out?

BinoFi isn’t just about promising returns; it’s about delivering real utility and solving real problems in crypto markets. At the core of its platform lies a commitment to innovation. Here are its standout features:

Hybrid Exchange Model : Centralized and decentralized exchanges each have distinct advantages, but neither fully meets the demands of modern traders. BinoFi’s hybrid model combines the liquidity and efficiency of CEXs with the transparency and control of DEXs, offering seamless functionality without trade-offs.

Cross-Chain Trading Capabilities: Interoperability remains one of the biggest challenges in crypto trading, but BinoFi’s infrastructure enables traders to exchange assets across different blockchains with ease, foregoing reliance on bridges and centralized intermediaries.

Gasless Transactions & Enhanced Security: Powered by Multi-Party Computation (MPC) wallet technology, BinoFi ensures state-of-the-art security for traders while minimizing high transaction costs often associated with blockchain networks.

While many projects offer theoretical value propositions, BinoFi’s features are designed to tackle existing market pain points and optimize the trading experience across the board.

Exclusive Perks for Early Adopters

For those considering an investment in BinoFi, the benefits extend far beyond potential price appreciation. The presale phase includes unique perks for early supporters, incentivizing participation and fostering a committed community of users.

Here’s what’s on offer for presale participants:

Trading Fee Discounts: Early buyers gain access to reduced fees on transactions performed within the BinoFi ecosystem, maximizing their profitability.

Staking Rewards: Tokens bought during the presale can be staked to earn passive income, adding another layer of utility for long-term holders.

Governance Participation: Early adopters are empowered with a say in the platform’s future, contributing to key decisions that shape BinoFi’s evolution and ensuring a user-focused approach.

These perks are an extension of BinoFi’s vision to prioritize its community, rewarding those who support it during its foundational stages.

Why Analysts Are Optimistic

The excitement surrounding BinoFi isn’t purely speculative. Analysts are paying close attention to its ability to address inefficiencies in crypto trading while standing out in a crowded market.

The strong presale phase, coupled with a well-articulated roadmap, underscores its potential to rise significantly in the coming years.

Notably, BinoFi’s projection to achieve a valuation explosion by 2025 aligns with larger macro trends in cryptocurrency.

With blockchain adoption continuing to grow and trading volumes expected to expand, projects like BinoFi that innovate are likely to outperform in the next market cycle.

Looking Ahead

Michael Saylor’s influence may stir optimism across the crypto community, but it’s projects like BinoFi that offer tangible, actionable opportunities.

Built on a foundation of innovation and backed by a roadmap with clear intentions, BinoFi is a prime example of the kind of project that could define the next wave of crypto growth.

With its $0.02 presale price, exclusive tools and features, and a projected $0.30 listing, securing 15x gains right out the door for it’s investors, BinoFi is already making headlines in its own right. Combine that with predictions of a 2025 explosion, and it’s easy to see why this project is turning heads.

For those ready to position themselves for the future, BinoFi offers a compelling narrative of progress, innovation, and potential. The question now is, will you play a part in its story?

https://blockonomi.com,Could Cardano Climb to $4? Analysts Suggest Mutuum Finance (MUTM) May Offer Greater Upside,https://blockonomi.com/could-cardano-climb-to-4-analysts-suggest-mutuum-finance-mutm-may-offer-greater-upside/,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 20:00:08 GMT","Cardano (ADA) has long been hailed as a robust smart contract platform, yet its price movement has prompted questions about its next big breakout. Currently hovering around $0.69, ADA would require a substantial rally to hit $4—an increasingly challenging goal given its market cap and the fierce competition it faces. While Cardano’s fundamentals remain solid, its gradual development pace and modest network adoption are pushing many investors to explore projects with higher growth potential.

In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has caught the attention of crypto enthusiasts who see it as a rising star in decentralized finance. During Phase 3 of its presale, MUTM is priced at $0.02 per token and has already drawn over 5,300 backers, raising a total of $3.1 million. Early adopters in Phase 3 are set for a 200% gain when the token launches at $0.06, and analysts predict that MUTM could climb to $4—representing a potential 200x increase.

Cardano’s $4 Ambition: A Mountain to Climb?

Cardano (ADA) is well-known for its secure and scalable blockchain infrastructure, but price appreciation has lagged behind expectations. Trading around $0.69, ADA would need an explosive surge to reach $4—a feat that appears increasingly daunting given the platform’s sizable market cap and measured development roadmap. Despite its technological strengths and staking opportunities, some investors have grown restless, turning to emerging platforms like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in search of more rapid gains.

Mutuum Finance Presale: Gaining Momentum

While Cardano grapples with its own hurdles, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to thrive, drawing investors undeterred by ADA’s setbacks. During its presale, over 5,300 participants have already contributed $3.1 million. With Phase 3 in full swing, the token’s value now stands at $0.02, on track to hit $0.06 at launch—a 200% jump for anyone buying in at the current price.

Mutuum Finance’s standout offering is a dual-lending protocol aimed at accommodating both borrowers and lenders:

P2C (Peer-to-Contract): Automated liquidity pools adjust interest rates to maximize capital efficiency. P2P (Peer-to-Peer): Direct lending arrangements eliminate middlemen, giving participants greater control over loan terms and interest rates—even for coins like SHIB or DOGE.

In addition, the platform has adopted automated security features, transparent transactions, and the option of fixed or variable interest rates. All smart contracts undergo external audits and are accessible as open-source code.

Mutuum Finance’s roadmap includes a buyback and revenue-sharing mechanism—critical factors in sustaining growth. Future exchange listings will also improve liquidity and accessibility, driven by increasing demand for the platform.

Mutuum Finance is rewarding its initial user base with a $100,000 giveaway, offering ten winners $10,000 each in MUTM tokens. A referral program further accelerates community growth, handing out bonuses to users who bring new participants into the project.

For Cardano (ADA) to leap from $0.69 to $4, it must overcome significant obstacles, prompting some investors to pivot toward projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Now in Phase 3 of its presale at $0.02, MUTM has already raised $3.1 million from over 5,300 investors, with plans to list at $0.06 (a 200% gain before official trading). Experts project a potential price of $4 by 2025—a remarkable 200x from its current value. Featuring dual-model lending, staking rewards, and robust security, MUTM is positioning itself as a disruptive force in DeFi. For those seeking to invest before another price hike, the clock is ticking.

https://blockonomi.com,"Experts Suggest New Crypto Era is Coming, Coldware Leads The Helm",https://blockonomi.com/ethereum-price-chart-indicates-the-end-experts-suggest-new-crypto-era-is-coming-coldware-leads-the-helm/,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 17:31:27 GMT","The cryptocurrency market is on the brink of significant change, as Ethereum (ETH), once considered a leading blockchain for decentralized applications, faces the possibility of a major downturn. With many traders losing confidence in Ethereum, experts are pointing to the rise of new players in the market that could be ready to take the lead. Coldware (COLD) is at the forefront of this new wave of cryptocurrency innovation, and its rapid growth is challenging the dominance of Ethereum (ETH) and other major altcoins.

Coldware (COLD): A New Era in Cryptocurrency

In stark contrast to Ethereum’s struggles, Coldware (COLD) is emerging as a beacon of hope for crypto investors seeking new opportunities. Coldware is a Web3 platform designed to bridge the gap between decentralized applications and the growing mobile ecosystem. Unlike Ethereum (ETH), Coldware has embraced the mobile-first approach, which appeals to both users and developers who are looking for practical blockchain applications.

Coldware’s token, COLD, has experienced exponential growth, rising by a staggering 14,000% in recent months. The platform’s unique focus on mobile blockchain applications sets it apart from Ethereum and other projects, providing it with a distinct edge in the market. As Ethereum (ETH) faces declining confidence, Coldware is rapidly building a strong user base, with increasing support from investors.

For those looking for an investment in the next generation of decentralized applications, Coldware (COLD) offers a compelling case. Its mobile-first strategy and rapid growth make it a top contender for those looking to hedge against Ethereum’s ongoing struggles.

Ethereum’s Struggles: A Bearish Outlook

Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been experiencing substantial volatility in recent weeks. Despite its technological advancements, including the transition to Ethereum 2.0, Ethereum’s price has faced significant declines, reflecting broader concerns about the sustainability of the project in its current form. Recent reports indicate that Ethereum ETFs have been experiencing significant withdrawals, further dampening investor confidence.

Moreover, as Ethereum (ETH) struggles with the impact of broader market conditions, such as regulatory uncertainty and investor sentiment shifts, its price chart is indicating a bearish trend. If Ethereum cannot regain its momentum, experts are predicting a possible long-term decline, with some market analysts suggesting that Ethereum may be entering a phase of market stagnation.

Ethereum’s future in the current crypto climate appears uncertain, and many traders are now looking for alternatives to Ethereum’s dominance in the market.

What Does the Future Hold for Ethereum and Coldware?

As Ethereum’s price shows signs of stagnation and uncertainty, Coldware’s (COLD) rise signals a potential shift in the cryptocurrency landscape. Ethereum may continue to play a significant role in the space, but Coldware’s innovative approach to blockchain and mobile integration positions it as the leader of the new crypto era.

In the coming months, Ethereum (ETH) could face further challenges, particularly if its market decline continues. Meanwhile, Coldware’s upward trajectory is set to continue, with more investors seeking refuge in projects with practical applications and solid growth potential.

With Coldware leading the charge, a new era of decentralized applications could be on the horizon, signaling a departure from Ethereum’s dominance and a fresh start for crypto enthusiasts. As Ethereum’s future grows uncertain, Coldware’s innovation and market performance present an exciting opportunity for those looking to invest in the next generation of cryptocurrency technology.

Traders Lose Faith and Hedge With New RWA Cryptocurrency Priced at $0.0045,https://blockonomi.com/ethereum-enroute-to-bottoming-out-traders-lose-faith-and-hedge-with-new-rwa-cryptocurrency-priced-at-0-0045/,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 17:29:54 GMT","The cryptocurrency market has seen some turbulent times, with Ethereum (ETH) standing out as one of the biggest assets hit by the ongoing fluctuations. Despite its massive popularity and widespread adoption, Ethereum has found itself struggling to maintain momentum as key factors weigh on its price. Ethereum’s performance in recent weeks has been marred by investor concerns, particularly after a series of challenges surrounding the Ethereum ETF proposal and large withdrawals from Ethereum ETFs, which has made many investors question whether the asset is nearing its bottom.

Ethereum’s (ETH) attempt to integrate staking into its ETFs was viewed as a much-needed boost, but it faced setbacks. As Ethereum struggles to recover, many traders are looking for other ways to hedge their investments, with some turning to new projects that offer higher potential returns and security, such as Coldware (COLD), a Web3 mobile solution with a massive upside.

Coldware (COLD): The New Player for Traders Seeking Growth

While Ethereum’s performance continues to falter, Coldware (COLD) is positioning itself as the new cryptocurrency to watch, especially for those looking for promising alternatives in a bearish market. Coldware (COLD), a mobile-first Web3 platform, has rapidly attracted attention as a utility token that aims to bridge the gap between blockchain technology and everyday mobile usage.

Coldware’s entry into the market has been nothing short of revolutionary. As Ethereum and other well-established players face a downturn, Coldware has surged, rallying an incredible 14,000% in just a few months. Traders who lost faith in Ethereum have been turning to Coldware as a potential hedge against broader market volatility. The unique proposition of Coldware, which leverages mobile technology and decentralization, has captivated investors who are looking for the next big thing in blockchain and cryptocurrency.

Traders who are seeking an alternative to Ethereum’s (ETH) declining value have found Coldware to be a promising option, as its growth trajectory looks poised for continued expansion. The project’s utility and real-world applications, combined with a rapidly growing user base, have set it apart from other cryptocurrencies.

The Decline of Ethereum’s Market Sentiment

Ethereum (ETH), once the dominant blockchain for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, has been battling a number of issues recently. Despite the ongoing development in the Ethereum ecosystem, including advancements in scaling and the much-anticipated Ethereum 2.0 upgrades, the broader market sentiment has left ETH in the red. Over the past week, Ethereum’s price fell to the lowest point since late 2023, hovering just above the $1,800 mark. As the market braces itself for potential downturns, Ethereum appears to be struggling to regain its footing, following a major sell-off in the wake of large withdrawals from Ethereum ETFs.

Fidelity, one of the leading players in the traditional finance sector, has been trying to integrate staking into its Ethereum ETF. The proposal has been seen as a means to boost investor confidence and provide enhanced returns, which could have a positive impact on Ethereum’s market position. However, it remains to be seen if the SEC will approve this proposal, as concerns around security, transparency, and investor protection remain.

The Rising Demand for RWA Cryptocurrencies

While Ethereum’s struggles are garnering attention, many traders are seeking more stable and rewarding opportunities. The rise of Real-World Asset (RWA) cryptocurrencies is becoming increasingly apparent, as new tokens like Coldware (COLD) offer a unique and much-needed solution in the Web3 space. With Ethereum and Bitcoin facing stiff resistance, many investors are beginning to look at innovative and disruptive projects like Coldware as the future of the cryptocurrency market.

By providing a mobile-centric, decentralized platform that appeals to both developers and end-users, Coldware is not just another altcoin but a comprehensive solution that taps into a much broader market. Coldware’s price, currently at $0.0045, represents a promising entry point for those who missed out on earlier opportunities in Ethereum, Solana, and other top-performing coins.

What’s Next for Ethereum and Coldware?

As Ethereum (ETH) struggles with mounting concerns around its ETF approval and market outflows, Coldware continues to thrive and push towards broader adoption. With a growing community and increasing interest from investors, Coldware (COLD) is quickly becoming a dominant player in the Web3 and blockchain ecosystem.

In the coming months, Ethereum may see some stabilization, especially if the staking integration is approved, but Coldware is already carving out a space for itself in the market. Traders who have lost faith in Ethereum are likely to find Coldware a more attractive option due to its lower entry cost and high-growth potential.

In conclusion, while Ethereum (ETH) continues to face challenges and uncertainty, Coldware (COLD) presents an exciting opportunity for traders looking for the next big mover in the cryptocurrency space. With Ethereum’s future still uncertain, Coldware (COLD) offers a promising alternative for those ready to capitalize on a new era in the world of decentralized finance and mobile blockchain solutions.

https://blockonomi.com,BinoFi (BINO) Gains Attention from Ethereum (ETH) Holders While Bitcoin (BTC) Crashes Below 80k,https://blockonomi.com/binofi-bino-gains-attention-from-ethereum-eth-holders-while-bitcoin-btc-crashes-below-80k/,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 17:00:35 GMT","The cryptocurrency market never sleeps, and neither does its rollercoaster volatility. Bitcoin recently made headlines for all the wrong reasons, crashing below the $80K benchmark.

But while the king of crypto struggles with unpredictability, a rising star is stealing attention, especially from Ethereum holders. BinoFi (BINO), a new DeFi project, is capturing the interest of wise investors, and it’s easy to see why.

With its pioneering hybrid crypto exchange model and a presale price of just $0.02, this promising project is positioning itself as a game-changer in a market hungry for innovation.

Why Ethereum Holders are Turning to BinoFi

Ethereum holders are no strangers to innovation. Many of them have ridden the waves of DeFi, NFTs, and smart contract ecosystems, making them acutely aware of projects that offer genuine value. BinoFi has struck a chord with this community by addressing the real pain points of crypto trading.

At the core of its appeal is BinoFi’s status as the first-ever hybrid crypto exchange. What this means is that BinoFi smoothly merges the strengths of centralized exchanges (CEXs) with those of decentralized exchanges (DEXs).

It provides users with the speed, convenience, and liquidity typically found in CEXs, while offering the transparency, autonomy, and security that DEX users demand. This dual approach eliminates the compromises traders have traditionally faced, catering perfectly to Ethereum holders who value both efficiency and decentralization.

Another feature that has resonated strongly with Ethereum users is BinoFi’s cross-chain trading capabilities. By enabling transactions across blockchain ecosystems like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and many more, BinoFi helps bridge the gaps that usually isolate assets on different chains.

This level of interoperability is a major draw for Ethereum holders, many of whom are already deeply involved in multi-chain ecosystems.

The MVP Launch Drives Confidence

BinoFi’s attraction doesn’t stop at innovation. What sets it apart is its focus on implementation. The upcoming Minimum Viable Product (MVP) launch promises to deliver features that Ethereum holders can immediately recognize as groundbreaking.

From gasless transactions that sidestep Ethereum’s notoriously high fees during congestions to enhanced wallet security leveraging Multi-Party Computation (MPC), the MVP isn’t just a dry, theoretical roadmap. It’s a concrete glimpse of what makes BinoFi stand out.

These tangible deliverables are critical, particularly for Ethereum investors who have a keen eye for functional platforms and projects that can deliver on their promises. BinoFi’s MVP roadmap represents serious plans to meet the expectations of a growing community.

The Presale Opportunity Everyone’s Talking About

No discussion of BinoFi is complete without addressing its presale, which is turning heads across the crypto space. Priced at a mere $0.02 per token, the presale presents an unparalleled opportunity for early adopters to secure a stake in a project brimming with potential. Compared to its $0.30 listing price, early investors are in line for an impressive 15x return right from launch.

But what makes the presale even more attractive are the exclusive perks offered to early buyers. From bonus token rewards to community recognition, these extras show that BinoFi is actively incentivizing its earliest supporters. For Ethereum holders who understand the value of being early, the presale checks all the right boxes.

BinoFi is also leading an ambitious $1 million Giveaway, adding another layer of excitement and buzz around the presale. Ethereum investors, already used to ecosystem rewards and participation incentives, are finding this offer particularly compelling.

From Meme to Mainstream: The Unstoppable Rise of Dogecoin

Dogecoin began in 2013 as a lighthearted joke. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it used the Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin’s limited supply, Dogecoin was designed to be abundant, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute and no maximum supply. This playful approach caught people’s attention. In 2021, Dogecoin’s value soared, becoming one of the top ten cryptocurrencies with a market value over $50 billion. Social media buzz, especially from Elon Musk, fueled this rise. What started as fun showed the power of online communities.

Dogecoin’s technology is similar to other cryptocurrencies, but its uniqueness lies in its community and accessibility. Its plentiful supply makes it less costly to transact, appealing for everyday use. In the current market, many cryptocurrencies focus on complex technologies. Dogecoin stands out by being simple and approachable. While other coins aim to revolutionize industries, Dogecoin embraces its role as the people’s crypto. Recent trends show a growing interest in easy-to-understand cryptocurrencies. As the market evolves, Dogecoin’s friendly image and strong community support keep it in the spotlight. Whether it will continue to thrive depends on market dynamics, but its journey from meme to mainstream is remarkable.

Conclusion

While coins like DOGE have been impressive, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out with its sports-focused meme platform, aiming for massive growth and community-driven success.

https://blockonomi.com,Top Cryptos To Watch In March: BlockchainFX’s Game-Changing Trading Platform Whitelist Is Almost Full,https://blockonomi.com/top-cryptos-to-watch-in-march-blockchainfxs-game-changing-trading-platform-whitelist-is-almost-full/,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 11:50:55 GMT","As the crypto market gains momentum in 2025, investors are searching for the top cryptos to watch in March. With new innovations and disruptive platforms emerging, traders know that getting in early on game-changing projects can lead to massive rewards. Among the most promising projects right now are BlockchainFX, Filecoin, and Uniswap, each offering unique advantages that could fuel strong growth in the coming months.

BlockchainFX: The Future of Multi-Asset Trading

Trading has evolved beyond just crypto. Traditional investors are looking to integrate stocks, ETFs, forex, and commodities into their portfolios, while crypto traders want the ability to seamlessly switch between asset classes. BlockchainFX brings both worlds together, creating a platform where users can swap Bitcoin for Tesla stock, Ethereum for gold, or even Solana for forex pairs, all in one place.

For traders, speed and efficiency are everything. Unlike traditional brokerages and crypto exchanges that require users to move funds between multiple platforms, BlockchainFX eliminates unnecessary friction, allowing for instant multi-asset swaps. This means no more delays, complicated transfers, or excessive fees, just direct seamless trading at the click of a button.

Beyond its multi-market trading capabilities, BlockchainFX is capturing attention because of its unique 70% revenue-sharing model. Instead of keeping all the trading fees for itself, the platform redistributes the majority of its revenue back to users in BFX and USDT staking rewards. This gives traders the opportunity to earn passive income while using the platform, making BlockchainFX one of the most profitable ecosystems for active investors.

Filecoin: The Backbone of Decentralized Storage

While BlockchainFX is revolutionizing trading, Filecoin (FIL) is transforming how data is stored and accessed on the blockchain. As more companies embrace Web3, the need for decentralized file storage solutions has skyrocketed. Filecoin offers a secure, decentralized, and cost-effective alternative to traditional cloud storage providers like Amazon AWS and Google Drive.

By utilizing a network of distributed nodes, Filecoin ensures data redundancy, security, and resistance to censorship. With its growing adoption in NFT marketplaces, enterprise data storage, and blockchain applications, FIL is positioned for long-term growth. As Web3 adoption accelerates, Filecoin remains one of the top cryptos to watch in March.

Uniswap: The Leader in Decentralized Trading

Another strong contender for March is Uniswap (UNI), the leading decentralized exchange (DEX). Unlike centralized platforms that control trading and custody, Uniswap allows users to swap crypto assets directly from their wallets, ensuring full ownership of their funds.

Uniswap has seen over $3.5 billion in trading fees generated, proving the demand for decentralized financial tools. As regulatory scrutiny increases on centralized exchanges, more traders are shifting towards DEX platforms, and Uniswap continues to dominate the sector. The launch of Uniswap v4, which introduces more efficient liquidity management and customizable trading pools, further solidifies its place as a leading DeFi project.

The Best Time to Get In Is Now

The whitelist for BlockchainFX is almost full, and those who secure a spot before its public launch will have the advantage of early access to BFX tokens at the best rates. Meanwhile, Filecoin and Uniswap continue to gain momentum, positioning themselves as must-watch cryptos in the evolving blockchain landscape.

For investors looking to capitalize on the next big thing in crypto trading, decentralized storage, and DeFi, these three projects stand out among the top cryptos to watch in March. Whether it’s trading across multiple asset classes, securing decentralized storage solutions, or embracing decentralized finance, these cryptos offer compelling opportunities for those looking to stay ahead in the market.

https://blockonomi.com,Solana Price Prediction: Solana Still Struggles Amid FTX Unlock; RBLK Presale Hits Close To $11M,https://blockonomi.com/solana-price-prediction-solana-still-struggles-amid-ftx-unlock-rblk-presale-hits-close-to-11m/,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 11:46:16 GMT","Solana just can’t catch a break. With 11.2 million SOL—worth a jaw-dropping $1.57 billion—hitting the market after FTX’s latest unlock, investors are bracing for turbulence. The Solana price prediction remains uncertain as selling pressure mounts, and traders scramble to make sense of the chaos.

But while SOL stumbles, Online casino, Rollblock’s (RBLK) crypto presale is soaring, closing in on a massive $11 million. Could this be the safer bet? As Solana fights to regain momentum, savvy investors are keeping an eye on the next big move in the market. Let’s dive in!

Why Rollblock’s crypto presale is winning big

Catching a crypto gem during presale is like snagging concert tickets before they sell out—if you’re in early, the rewards can be huge. Just ask early investors of coins like Shiba Inu and Avalanche, who watched their tiny investments explode after launch. That’s why there’s so much buzz around Rollblock’s (RBLK) crypto presale.

Now in its 10th presale round, each RBLK is priced at just $0.061, and it’s already raked in nearly $11 million. Over 30.6 million tokens have been snapped up, and investors seem to believe they’re onto something big.

So, why is Rollblock attracting this kind of attention? For starters, it’s all about transparency and trust. As a GambleFi Protocol, every transaction is recorded on the blockchain, making them permanent and tamper-proof. No shady business here. What you see is what you get. That’s a rare comfort in a crypto landscape where things can feel as clear as mud.

But transparency isn’t the only reason investors are paying attention. Rollblock’s multicurrency staking feature means you can stake with Bitcoin, Ethereum, or even Dogecoin. Unlike traditional staking, where you’re limited to a single token, Rollblock allows users to earn rewards using various cryptocurrencies. Your favorite tokens can now work for you in the background while you play.

Speaking of playing, Rollblock’s Play-to-Earn program is a game-changer, literally. Players earn tokenized cashback for every game they play. So, whether you win or lose at the tables, you’re stacking up rewards. It’s like getting a consolation prize that’s actually worth something.

With features like these, it’s no surprise Rollblock’s crypto presale is gaining serious momentum. It’s offering more than just tokens, it’s setting the stage for a gaming experience where play meets profit.

Solana price prediction: why the FTX unlock is still casting a shadow

Solana is still feeling the heat after the recent unlocking of 11.2 million SOL tokens, valued at a hefty $1.57 billion, from the bankrupt FTX estate. This massive influx of tokens into the market has sparked fears of increased selling pressure, making investors understandably jittery.

The uncertainty has led to a sharp decline in confidence, with Solana dipping below key price levels. Over the past month, Solana’s price has declined from around $190 to $127. This negative sentiment is further fueled by traders shorting SOL, betting on further declines. It’s a cautious atmosphere, and that’s keeping the Solana price prediction clouded in doubt.

Until the market fully absorbs the impact of this token release, Solana’s recovery could remain sluggish. The big question is whether investor confidence can bounce back or if the lingering effects of the unlock will continue to weigh on the Solana price prediction in the coming months.

Conclusion

Solana’s struggle with the FTX unlock continues to cloud its price prediction, while Rollblock’s (RBLK) presale races toward $11 million. With Play-to-Earn rewards and secure staking, RBLK is drawing attention in all the right ways.

In this high-stakes game, is Solana a sinking ship or just waiting for a rebound? And will Rollblock’s momentum translate into long-term success? Time will tell—but smart money is already placing its bets.

Slow exchange withdrawals, excessive conversion fees, and banking restrictions have made crypto-to-FIAT transactions a nightmare until now.

Enter Remittix (RTX), a project that’s solving this problem by offering instant crypto-to-FIAT conversions with direct bank transfers. No more waiting days for transactions to clear, no middlemen taking a cut, just straightforward payments that actually work for real-world use.

Investors are taking notice, and the Remittix presale has now raised over $13.8 million, with RTX tokens priced at $0.0734. As blockchain-powered payments gain traction, Remittix is positioning itself as one of the most practical crypto projects on the market today.

Why Crypto Payments Are Still Stuck in the Past

For all the talk about crypto replacing traditional finance, most people still can’t spend their digital assets in everyday life. Converting crypto into FIAT often involves dealing with long-winded exchange processes, paying out excessive fees and waiting for days for the transfer to go through.

For someone like Moses, a freelancer in Kenya, this process can be a serious headache. He earns in stablecoins but needs Kenyan Shillings to pay rent and buy groceries.

With Remittix, he can convert USDT into local currency instantly with no unnecessary steps, no banking roadblocks.

Similarly, Aisha, an expat in Canada, can send crypto to her family in Pakistan, knowing they’ll receive full value in Rupees within minutes without the outrageous remittance fees banks and Western Union would charge.

Privacy Is Becoming a Top Concern for Crypto Users

As financial regulations tighten, many users are looking for ways to move money without excessive oversight. Banks and traditional payment services monitor every transaction, impose restrictions and sometimes freeze accounts without warning.

Remittix provides a discreet alternative, ensuring that users can move funds without unnecessary scrutiny. When money is sent through Remittix, the recipient receives a normal bank transfer, no crypto-related flags, no blocked payments, no questions asked.

For people living in countries with strict financial restrictions, this kind of autonomy is becoming increasingly important.

Investors Race To Secure RTX Tokens

The Remittix presale is going ahead at full speed, with the native RTX token seeing more than $13.8 million in investment to date. Priced at just $0.0734 in the current stage, now is an opportune moment to get in before the price booms.

The project’s forward-thinking approach and real world practically have prompted analysts to anticipate a steep 800% price rise during the presale, with more growth expected post-launch. Don’t miss out on this market disruptor in 2025.

Holders Turn To Remittix’s ICO For Fixed Returns,https://blockonomi.com/is-shiba-inu-set-for-recovery-or-are-more-losses-incoming-holders-turn-to-remittixs-ico-for-fixed-returns/,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 11:30:20 GMT","Two tokens are noteworthy in a world where one gains and loses riches overnight: Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Remittix (RTX). Shiba Inu’s technicals show a price retracing, but Remittix’s creative approach to cross-border financing is generating waves.

Now, some experts believe RTX will see an amazing 25x rise before May. Read on to learn more.

Shiba Inu Tests Key Support Levels

Shiba Inu is under pressure around $0.000012–$0.000015 per on-chain statistics from IntoTheBlock. A significant support is seen by around 23,200 addresses holding more than 19 trillion SHIB at $0.000012.

Conversely, with about 12 trillion SHIB in unrealized losses, opposition at $0.000015 appears less. This disparity shows that SHIB pricing might momentarily rise beyond $0.000015. Other hints provide a more wary viewpoint.

The MACD becoming positive and the 12 EMA passing over the 26 EMA points the 4-hour chart toward a likely upswing. On the other hand, failing to break higher might set off a negative trend in case purchasing evaporates results in a return below $0.000011.

Investors are becoming uneasy as SHIB trades significantly below its early 2025 highs even if its near-term future is still unknown. Though for the time being its technicals are signaling danger, the future of the meme currency might be riding new excitement or an unexpected trigger.

Remittix Is Poised To Lead The PayFi Sector

Remittix, a new PayFi project, is forging its own path with a pragmatic twist that’s catching investors’ attention. Just at $0.0734 today, this PayFi innovator claims to simplify cross-border payments, a segment ready for upheaval.

Remittix’s goal is to overcome long-standing issues in international finance by means of its creative solution for conventional remittance systems. Imagine being able to easily turn crypto into spendable money without KYC complications and costs free of sting.

The PayFi ecosystem within Remittix offers consumers a simple way to instantaneously convert cryptocurrencies into fiat money, therefore allowing swift borderless money transfers at minimal cost.

Unlike many initiatives motivated only by hype, Remittix offers real value by allowing seamless, almost instantaneous crypto-to- fiat exchanges.

Remittix not only streamlines world payments but also closes the distance between the digital asset ecosystem and conventional financial institutions by supporting over 40 crypto pairings and more than 30 fiat currencies.

Buy Remittix Now For Massive Gains

Remittix is opening the path for a new age of blockchain usefulness with a committed strategy, strong security and compliance policies, and an eye on financial inclusivity.

The RTX currency has a good investing potential at $0.0734 pre-sale. Forecasts suggest considerable rise; demand for unique cross-border payment solutions is generating a 25x multiplier in the presale period and over 1,500% growth post launch.

https://blockonomi.com,Is Cardano Price Set To Increase? Crypto’s Like Remittix Unaffected By Market Conditions See Huge Buying Momentum,https://blockonomi.com/is-cardano-price-set-to-increase-cryptos-like-remittix-unaffected-by-market-conditions-see-huge-buying-momentum/,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 11:28:29 GMT","The market has taken notice as Cardano (ADA) experienced a sudden price surge during Donald Trump’s decision to include ADA alongside Solana (SOL) and XRP in the country’s Crypto Strategic Reserve. After its dramatic increase from $0.64 to the high point at $1.13 ADA continues to raise skepticism about potential market correction.

The altcoin Remittix shows no signs of market influence regardless of price movements since it remains at $0.0734 while attracting huge buying interest.

Cardano’s Recent Surge and Correction

The price increase of Cardano token from $0.64 to $1.13 represented a fast and strong market movement among cryptocurrencies. The Crypto Strategic Reserve announced by Trump resulted in ADA becoming one of the assets—including Solana and XRP—that experts identified as crucial for Ukrainian crypto development.

When the Cardano market learnt about the news it experienced a severe upward movement which resulted in a 40% price surge in one week. In the most recent 24 hours the ADA price decreased by approximately 7% to establish itself at $0.71 at the time of writing.

Source: coingecko. Cardano’s price is currently $0.71

The market analysis about Cardano’s capacity to defend higher price levels shows disagreement among industry experts. Traders expressed skepticism after ADA reached a close point to $0.9961 earlier in the day before returning to lower levels thus prompting traders to hold back from quick purchases at $1.

One of Cardano’s co-founders Charles Hoskinson failed to obtain an invitation to attend the White House Crypto Summit as confirmed by an inside source. Members within the community expressed disappointment after learning Cardano would not formally appear at the event.

The continuing expansion of the network proceeds while direct government attendance in important crypto conferences remains postponed at this time. Market analysts observe Cardano price levels at $0.71 while keeping an eye out for price recovery back to $1 despite the lack of White House backing.

Remittix: Steady Growth Unaffected by Market Dips

Cardano battles with extreme price fluctuations but another token (Remittix) continues to grow steadily. The Remittix platform maintains a price of $0.0734 through presale activities that exceeded $13.8 million and token sale surpassing 518 million. The market shows minimal impact on Remittix throughout daily trading movements according to market observers.

The PayFi platform of Remittix serves real payment needs by enabling quick movements between cryptocurrency and fiat currency transactions. The token has gained steady demand because every new investor understands it serves to connect regular transaction processes.

User-friendly features of Remittix product design gives credence to its stable performance. The focus of Remittix lies in simple integration capabilities with merchants and global money transfer solutions as well as regulatory compliance infrastructure. The coin achieves superiority over market-sensitive cryptocurrencies because of its ability to shield itself from speculative price fluctuations.

Remittix and the Bigger Picture

Investors now watch Remittix alongside Cardano’s dollar market prospects because the currency has shown resilience throughout unpredictable market conditions. The organization developed its mission to serve real users and businesses with simple crypto payment solutions which indicates a methodical ascent towards market position.

The functionality of Remittix to connect digital assets with everyday transaction requirements allows it to avoid the price fluctuations typical of many tokens in the market. It presents itself as a resilient investment alternative for people who require higher return consistency.

Two Different Paths Toward Success

The Cardano token followed a quick rise from $1.13 before falling down to $0.71 illustrating how rapidly market emotions transform about official announcements regardless of their credibility. Cardano will gain increased market interest if it can successfully sustain values above $1 throughout upcoming days.

The steady consistent growth of Remittix demonstrates success can manifest through controlled expansion rather than through dramatic price surges. The victory between Remittix and ADA depends on their ability to handle market shifts because Remittix demonstrates stable adoption while ADA needs to either revive its rally or maintain its steady growth to remain competitive.
