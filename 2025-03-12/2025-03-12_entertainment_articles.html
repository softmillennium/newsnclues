Marshawn Lynch flunked an NFL drug test in 2009 ... and now the actual letter the league sent to the star running back is on the auction block!!

The auction, held by Lelands, also features a Babe Ruth signed baseball and a super valuable Michael Jordan card ... and while those may ultimately sell for more cash, the Beast Mode letter is by far the most unique item.

The correspondence, dated April 13, 2009 and written on an NFL letterhead, came from Dr. Lawrence S. Brown, a medical advisor to the National Football League.

In the letter, Dr. Brown informs Lynch, a Buffalo Bills RB in his third season in the league at the time, that his urine came up dirty for marijuana.

The envelope, which is also included as part of the auction lot, is stamped "CONFIDENTIAL."

Marshawn was not suspended ... and he ultimately went on to have quite the memorable career -- including a Super Bowl win with the Seattle Seahawks.

The Lynch letter has a starting bid floor of $300. Leland's auction closes Saturday night.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Season 13 of The Masked Singer has been full of surprises, but the reveals are just getting started — and Us Weekly has another sneak peek at a few clues.

Ahead of the Wednesday, March 12, episode, Us caught Group B contestant Space Ranger window shopping on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. His choice of boutique, Rolex, could be a major hint to his identity.

In these exclusive snaps, Space Ranger was spotted staring longingly at an out-of-this-world timepiece. Could this be a celebrity with a reputation for loving the finer things in life, like 30 Rock alum Tracy Morgan? Or maybe someone with the word “ice” in their name, like Vanilla Ice?

UFO hunters will have to keep watching The Masked Singer to find out who’s under the hat, but in the meantime, keep scrolling for more clues about Space Ranger:</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Soulja Boy’s former assistant is suing the rapper with allegations of rape, assault, and kidnapping in a lawsuit initially filed in California in 2021. The rapper, legal name DeAndre Cortez Way, headed into court this week in Los Angeles for the trial; opening statements will be shared “within days,” per a press release. The former assistant, a Jane Doe, says she began working for Way in 2018 for an agreed-upon wage of $500 a week. She claims once she began working for him, he sent her unsolicited, explicit photos. They eventually began a romantic relationship; however, she alleges the rapper was abusive, describing “kicking and punching and threats of violence and death” throughout their time together. “On one occasion, defendant Way punched plaintiff so hard in the head, she lost consciousness, only to wake up in a locked bedroom with no mattress, food or water,” the lawsuit reads. “On another occasion when plaintiff tried to quit and leave defendant Way, defendant Way locked her in a room for approximately three days against her will with no hot water until she was coerced into not leaving.” She claims she was not paid at all for any of the assistant work she did. Vulture has reached out to Way’s attorney for comment.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Elon Musk already has a lot of enemies — did he really need the country of Ireland coming after him too? Princess of Ireland Ayo Edebiri has posted that she received death threats in 2024 after Musk quoted a false news story claiming Disney was considering Edebiri to replace Johnny Depp in an upcoming Pirates of the Caribbean movie. “Just remembering when I got some of the most insane death threats and racial slurs of my life (idk if it’s the #1 moment, but for sure top 3) for a fake reboot of a movie I had never even heard of because of this man,” Edebiri wrote over a screenshot of Musk’s post from February 7, 2024. “LMAO. So not only is he double s**g h**l-ing fascist, he’s an idiot but anyway.” Musk’s quote-tweet read, “Disney sucks.” Edebiri’s post follows claims by Musk that he’s getting a lot of “flak,” including death threats, since speaking at Donald Trump’s first Cabinet meeting on February 26.

Earlier, Edebiri posted a screenshot of Bill Burr’s comments about Musk on NPR’s “Fresh Air.” “I’m trying to get regular people to stop yelling at each other and realize that it’s a select few group of nerds eating raw almonds and doing their stupid workouts and competing with each other to have the biggest infinity pool and the rest of us are getting pushed down,” Burr says in the screenshot. “They’ve politicized the whole stupid thing and we’re falling for it.” Edebiri then posted a screenshot of a friend telling her she would “eat” a Pirates update “up a lil bit,” which is true. Finally, Edebiri requested that news outlets “stop making my IG stories news” because “I’m just tryna have a silly goofy time.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

On Wednesday, March 12, a hearing was held in a Manhattan federal court regarding ICE’s detainment of Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident of the United States and a graduate of Columbia University. A large crowd gathered outside the courthouse to protest the detention and attempted deportation of the Palestinian student activist leader, who is married to an American citizen. Among the crowd was Susan Sarandon, who gave a statement in solidarity with Khalil. “No matter where you stand on genocide, freedom of speech is an issue, is a right, that we all have,” she told reporters. “And this is a turning point in the history and the freedom of this country.” The Six Triple Eight actor has long used her celebrity platform to support leftist causes ranging from Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaign to climate-change action. A month after the attacks of October 7, 2023, she spoke at a rally for Palestine.

On March 8 of this year, Khalil was arrested at his home by the Department of Homeland Security as part of a government campaign to crack down on campus protesters and was transported to a detention facility in Jena, Louisiana. Other celebrities who have expressed solidarity with Khalil include Finneas, Cynthia Nixon, Ramy Youssef, and Pauline Chalamet.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

BATON ROUGE, LA—As a direct result of receiving pediatric emergency care services, local toddler Tim Ilsington, who was hospitalized Monday, will reportedly spend the rest of his life associating Mickey Mouse with physical pain. Sources confirmed that the 2-year-old, who was admitted to Ochsner Medical Center after fracturing his ulna, will from this point forward let out an involuntary wince every time he even imagines the big ears and smiling face of the popular cartoon rodent. According to sources, the hours Ilsington spent in the brightly colored rooms of the hospital’s children’s wing will form an inexorable link in his mind between the Walt Disney Company’s mascot and agonizing bodily distress, leading him to experience convulsions and vomiting during viewings of Mickey Mouse Funhouse as a preschooler, or while visiting the Magic Kingdom as a preteen. Sources added that this hospitalization will lead to the adult Ilsington only being able to achieve sexual release by getting whipped by a partner dressed like Steamboat Willy.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

CHICAGO—Showing a graciousness and magnanimity that the rest of the world has denied these pariahs and rejects, Jordan Hall, the only good-looking person in the office, was reportedly mingling Wednesday with his hideous coworkers like a missionary among lepers. Several reports indicated that the handsome and fit Hall was drinking and eating alongside the outcasts without a care for the skin rashes that might pass to him, and he even mercifully accepted a pen from one of them as a humble gift. As he walked amongst the unwashed masses in his office like a Jesuit missionary engaging with pustule-covered natives, Hall is also said to have helped fostered a sense of community by leading the pale and sickly employees to a local bar and regaling them with stories of a better world, all the while knowing just how doomed they really were. At press time, sources confirmed Hall had left for a better offer at a larger company, leaving behind a cable-knit cardigan that the unsightly workers embraced as a style icon.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

PHILADELPHIA—Saying he was in the market for a more powerful and rugged vehicle, prospective car buyer Gabe Orcutt reportedly took an SUV out Wednesday for a test hit and run. “I took it for a spin through some pedestrians, and I like how smoothly this thing flees the scene of an accident,” Orcutt said of the GMC Acadia, adding that he was impressed by how well the mid-size sport utility vehicle handled curbs and bollards. “I popped right up on the sidewalk, over a guy, and into the park, no problem. The all-wheel drive was perfect for getting through the uneven mulch on the playground, and the backup camera made reversing out from under the slide so easy. Plus it gets great gas mileage. I topped out at 110 mph evading the police, and it barely used any gas.” Orcutt later confirmed that while he liked the Acadia, he ultimately needed something cheaper that wouldn’t depreciate the instant he drove it through a storefront window.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Let’s say you’re running a little bit hot tonight. You can barely see the road from the heat coming off it … you reach down between your legs and ease the seat back … to get your pristine copy of 2006’s Strummin’ with the Devil, a bluegrass album of Van Halen songs created under the tutelage of David Lee Roth. The record is now a personal favorite for John Mulaney, who told Rolling Stone in a new interview that he, Bill Hader, Fred Armisen, and Jimmy Kimmel are in a group chat dedicated to gossiping about the hard rockers. “I like Van Halen a lot and I like Diamond Dave’s bluegrass album of covers,” he said. “I’m embarrassed to say, it’s kind of in my shuffle.” Of the quartet’s thread, Mulaney added, “interviews with Alex and Eddie Van Halen about David is the platonic ideal.” (Mulaney also has a separate group chat with Kimmel and Nick Kroll about Kiss, where they “mainly” trade thoughts about Gene Simmons’s questionable business endeavors.) Mulaney tried to get Roth as a guest on his Everybody’s in L.A. live show last year, but the vocalist rejected every idea presented to him, including being a bandleader. “I should just call him up and say ‘Let’s party,’ and he might show up,” Mulaney joked at the time.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/the-valley-season-2-trailer-jax-taylor-brittany-cartwright.html'>The Valley Season Two Drama Reaches New Peaks</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-12 01:16:24 <p>
Guess bad things really do come in threes for Jax Taylor. “I already told him. Filing, restraining order, and custody,” Brittany Cartwright says in the trailer for the second season of The Valley. She’s already checked the first thing off her list; Taylor is served with divorce papers in the three-minute preview. Cartwright claims that the father of her 3-year-old son, Cruz, has been bringing girls to their home, with one allegedly leaving a thong and a baby wipe behind. She also alleges that he’s had people “watching” her. For his part, Taylor — who checked himself into rehab last year to address his mental health struggles and recently publicly acknowledged his history with cocaine addiction — says he’s “not satisfied” with who he is anymore, and admits to former Vanderpump Rules co-star Tom Schwartz that he “was a fucking terrible husband.”

But Cartwright and Taylor aren’t the only ones going through it this season: Jesse Lally alleges that Michelle Saniei cheated on him and is “sleeping with a billionaire for $1,500 a night” (which seems a bit stingy for someone with that kind of net worth), Danny Booko is accused of groping people, and Kristen Doute pointedly claims that Jason Caperna takes his wedding ring off when going out. Apart from Luke Broderick’s punny proposal to Doute on a boat, there’s hardly a happy moment in sight. If you’re in love with the dramatic season that this trailer wants to be, save the date for The Valley’s season-two premiere on April 15 at 9 p.m. ET on Peacock.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Heidi Klum's not telling any of her potential top models to get a room ... 'cause she's cool with them rolling around in a bed outside -- for a photo shoot, that is!

The supermodel was rolling around Hollywood Thursday in a flatbed truck along with a full crew ... and, they all looked on while a photographer snapped pics of two half-naked models rolling around together on the mattress.

Watch the clip ... Heidi chats with the person next to her as the two subjects hit different poses in just their underwear -- flexing every muscle they've got for the cameras.

It's a pretty wild scene ... and, sources tell us it's all for the 20th season of "Germany's Next Topmodel."

We're told the production team is recreating challenges from the past ... including this one, where a couple of the model contestants are moving but still need to pose for photos.

Heidi posted a video from the set ... not clear what she's saying 'cause it's in German -- but, it looks like she's excited to be filming!

BTW ... Heidi's created viral moments like this while filming the show multiple times over the years -- including back in 2018 when she watched a model shower on a public street.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Spike Feresten, a veteran writer in Hollywood, is raising money for students impacted by the Palisades fire ... by putting his classic motorcycle on the auction block.

Spike is auctioning off his 1966 Triumph Bonneville T120R ... and all the proceeds are going to the Palisades Charter High School Booster Club. We're told the money will go towards fire recovery at the school.

Much of the Palisades was destroyed in the January wildfire and the rebuilding efforts are underway ... but it's going to take a lot, and Spike is doing his part.

The guy's famous for writing on major TV shows like "Saturday Night Live," "Seinfeld," "The Simpsons" and for David Letterman. Spike's also been a screenwriter on "Bee Movie" and "Unfrosted."

Spike has a connection to Palisades Charter High School ... his sons are students there.

The auction ends next week and we're told the winning bidder will have the motorcycle delivered on Spike's YouTube show, "Spike's Car Radio," which he hosts with Paul Zuckerman.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A Black mother who lost her son before the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement says the removal of BLM Plaza in our nation's capital is a sign the country is in a bad place.

Ahmaud Arbery's mom, Wanda Cooper Jones, tells TMZ ... the removal of the BLM mural in Washington, D.C. "feels like a bad omen" and she says it serves as "a reminder of how fragile progress can be."

Play video content AP

Wanda says BLM was never about murals, monuments, or symbolic gestures ... it's always been about accountability, justice and meaningful change -- but she doesn't like the change being made here.

As we reported ... Jamie Foxx says Black American social efforts are taking a step back as a result of President Trump pressuring D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser to remove the mural under threat of losing federal funding.

Arbery was murdered in February 2020 while out for a run in Georgia ... and video of his murder at the hands of 3 white men sparked widespread outrage.

BLM really took off after George Floyd was murdered by a white cop months later, sparking summer protests nationwide ... but Arbery's case remains a big part of the movement ... as does Breonna Taylor's death. The Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown killings also prompted the early beginnings of the BLM cause.

Lee Merritt, an attorney who has worked with the families of Arbery, Floyd and Taylor, tells TMZ ... "Justice isn't measured in murals -- it's measured in laws, accountability, and protecting Black lives."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

... Absence From Show No Cause for Alarm

Kelly Clarkson's recent step back from her popular talk show isn't a cause for alarm despite all the online rumors ... TMZ has learned.

Here's the deal ... the singer-turned-TV personality has been noticeably absent from "The Kelly Clarkson Show" since early last week -- disappearing suddenly just before a show and abruptly forcing actor Simu Liu into an impromptu hosting role.

KC returned for a couple episodes last week ... but, she hasn't been onstage since March 5 -- and, it led to a whole lot of online speculation about her health.

In fact, many called on NBC -- the 'Clarkson Show' network -- to release a statement about her health ... fearing the worst for the star.

However, sources with direct knowledge tell TMZ ... Kelly herself is completely fine. She's been dealing with a personal matter that does not directly involve her.

We're told she'll be back in the studio -- and on the air -- tomorrow.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

"Snow White" has been drowning in controversy for months, and now with Disney more or less pulling the plug on the movie’s red carpet premiere, one of its key actors is beyond disappointed -- you might even say ... GRUMPY!

Martin Klebba, the voice of Grumpy -- one of the 7 dwarfs in the new flick -- tells TMZ ... he’s seriously bummed and a bit pissed Disney axed what should’ve been a massive premiere for such a major film -- all because of the ongoing controversies surrounding the film, and stars Gal Gadot and Rachel Zegler.

Martin tells us while Rachel, who plays Snow White, and Gal, as the Evil Queen, are entitled to their own political views and ideals, those personal opinions shouldn’t have overshadowed everyone else’s hard work -- no matter how much bitching about them is on social media.

Play video content TMZ.com

Martin's no stranger to big Disney premieres -- having played the fan-favorite Marty in the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' series – and says "Snow White" deserved to be a major event ... not just a ho-hum screening ... which it is, in comparison.

Variety reported yesterday Disney is significantly scaling back the film's premiere due to multiple controversies, including reactions to the 2 female stars' political stances.

As for the other controversy with Little People not playing the dwarfs IRL, Martin tells us that as far as he knows, motion-capture was always the plan and was not a knee-jerk reaction to Peter Dinklage blasting the project when it was announced.

That said ... Martin tells us it's unbelievably difficult for Little People to land Hollywood roles, let alone lead ones, so this could have been a bigger opportunity for others.

Still, he's hoping people go see the movie and enjoy it for what it is -- pure entertainment.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Dawn Robinson, the leading voice for R&B powerhouses En Vogue, Lucy Pearl, and even Dr. Dre's Firm supergroup at one point, is cleaning out her closet ... revealing she's been homeless, sleeping in her car for nearly 3 years.

The brave and shocking revelation came on Dawn's YouTube channel in a vid titled, "YOUR NEW LIFE IS IN THE SCARY 🫣" ... her channel sat dormant for a year and 6 months before Tuesday.

Dawn explains she fell on hard times during the pandemic and had been staying with her parents in Vegas before that situation fizzled.

She says her former co-manager convinced her to move back to L.A., where he strung her along, putting her in a hotel instead of helping her secure an apartment.

Dawn says she frustratingly started to research the culture of car-living and, to her surprise, learned she could easily adapt.

While she doesn't own a home, Dawn says she does have a membership at a gym, where she takes showers.

She credited her ex-boyfriend's mom, personal assistant Niecy, her brother Evin, and Klymaxx singer Joyce Irby for being her foundation ... but scolded her sister for wronging her in the past.

It's an interesting revelation ... En Vogue just performed (without Dawn) during the 2025 NBA All-Star Weekend for their Oakland hometown.

The group has reportedly sold over 20 million records and Lucy Pearl's one-and-only album was certified platinum when it dropped.</p></b><br/><br/></div>
