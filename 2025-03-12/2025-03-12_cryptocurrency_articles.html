According to Justin Sun, the cryptocurrency market is experiencing a phase of 'small steps, fast running' growth, indicating a strategy of incremental but rapid advancements. This approach suggests a focus on steady, manageable increases in value or technology improvements, rather than large, volatile jumps. Sun's commentary, shared via Twitter, highlights the importance of consistent progress in the volatile crypto space.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP face carnage in response to Trump's policies and announcements. The total market capitalization of crypto is down to $2.784 trillion on Wednesday. 

Bitcoin's correlation (BTC) with the S&P 500 is 0.75 in the 30-day timeframe, signaling to traders that the top crypto is behaving like U.S. equities. Trumpism, or what U.S. President Donald Trump believes in a particular moment on a particular day about a subject that has ushered a steep correction in crypto within the first fifty days of his administration. 

Table of Contents

U.S. stocks are facing a slump, the S&P 500 is down nearly 8% in the past month, and is lower than it was the day before President Trump won the 2024 election. $4.5 trillion in capital has been wiped out of the market, per the index, and the correction is not limited to equities. 

Crypto, typically considered one of the high volatility risk assets, has faced a steep decline as traders turn risk averse and pull capital from the category. 

While U.S. stock performance is among one of the worst ever recorded within the first 50 days of a new administration, crypto market capitalization is nearly 20% above the pre-election level, even after the correction. 

When Bitcoin crossed the $100,000 milestone and hit a new all-time high, Ethereum and XRP rallied alongside. The market-wide bloodbath has ushered a decline in the top three cryptos, down nearly 15%, 28% and 9% in the past month, according to TradingView data. 

Trump's pro-crypto executive orders and Strategic Crypto Reserve announcement have failed to catalyze a positive sentiment among traders. Alternative.me's Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows traders remain fearful on Wednesday. 

In a February report, Forbes evaluated the impact of Donald Trump's return to the Presidency on alternative investments like digital assets. The publication outlined that it depends on “the details of policy implementation, market expectations, and global economic conditions. While some sectors may benefit from deregulation or tax incentives, others might face reduced government support or policy shifts.”

Traders, therefore, need to proactively switch strategies and adjust portfolios, trade headline to headline, and anticipate the potential changes, such as the inclusion of different tokens in the U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve, to prioritize categories of tokens that are likely to receive favorable treatment or have inherent resilience to policy-induced volatility.

The crypto market and top three tokens continued their decline this week after nearly four-consecutive weeks of correction. As crypto traders digest Trump's tariff wars and executive orders, institutions and market participants have turned risk-averse and realized losses in Bitcoin are mounting. 

BTC is now at a crossroads where financial easing could mean crypto tokens gain, as traders drive demand for risk assets higher. However geopolitical headwinds and Trumpism continue to weigh heavily on the sector. 

The debate on whether a Strategic Crypto Reserve would meet the expectations of the crypto community and what the inclusion of Ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) means for holders of the token wages on social media platforms. 

Traders now wait and watch for the narrative to unfold. It is typical for the Bitcoin price to drop between 20 and 25% before it rallies during a bull market. However, the macroeconomic headwinds and higher number of market movers make it challenging to predict BTC price trends in the coming weeks and months. 

The $80,000 level remains a crucial support for Bitcoin; a return to the $100,000 milestone could see BTC rally towards its all-time high and test it. However, a decline from $80,000 could push the token to pre-election levels under $70,000. 

Another 15% drop from the current price level could erase all post-election gains for Bitcoin. 

Ethereum price is 30% below its pre-election level, back to the price recorded in November of 2023. A multitude of factors, lack of institutional interest, concerns regarding changes within the Ethereum Foundation, liquidation of whales who borrowed stablecoins against their Ether holdings as collateral, and waning interest from large wallet traders have negatively impacted Ethereum price trend. 

Ether trades at $1,846 at the time of writing, and traders await a catalyst, like SEC approval, to add staking to existing Ether ETFs in the U.S. to drive gains in the largest altcoin in crypto. 

XRP is the most resilient among the top three cryptocurrencies, trading 75% above its pre-election levels. At the time of writing, XRP trades at $2.1668. 

Catalysts like the token's addition to the U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve, Ripple executive's inclusion in Trump's elite Crypto Summit last Friday, and SEC's changing stance on litigation against crypto firms have contributed to the gain in XRP price. 

Bitcoin and XRP traders have consistently taken profits on their holdings since mid-February. However, in the case of Ethereum, the behavior of traders is akin to capitulation. Traders have realized losses on their Ether holdings, as seen by the negative spikes in the Network realized profit/loss metric on Santiment. 

Capitulation is followed by stability in prices, however it remains to be seen whether Ether price will recover in the coming weeks and months. 

The total open interest in USD in the three tokens has shown a steady decline since the last week of February. This implies that derivatives traders are losing interest in the top 3 cryptos, in line with the risk-off sentiment and the U.S. stock market bloodbath. 

As Bitcoin behaves more like a U.S. tech stock every day, the “Bitcoin as a hedge and safe haven” narrative takes a hit, and cryptos are identified as one of the risk-assets among alternative investments. 

A crypto analyst behind the X handle @davthewave believes that the worst of the crypto market correction is behind us. Bitcoin bull run is far from over, and the analyst checks the box on five key pointers that support their thesis. 

The average correction in Bitcoin price in the last three bull runs was between 24 and 32% in the years 2016-17, 2020-21 and 2023-24 respectively. The recent correction in BTC is therefore well within the average and does not directly signal the end of the bull market. 

The crypto Bitcoin bull run index is a metric used to analyze nine different statistics to determine the stage of the market cycle. Indicators like PI Cycle, MVRV Z-Score and Reserve Risk are used to identify whether it is a Bitcoin bull or bear market. 

In the last three cycles, every time CBBI crosses 90, Bitcoin hit a new all-time high. This hasn't happened yet in the ongoing cycle, meaning there is a likelihood that the bull market is ongoing and BTC is likely to peak in the coming months of 2025. 

Agne Linge, Head of Growth at WeFi shared written commentary with Crypto.news, commenting on rising market volatility in Bitcoin, in response to shifting macro conditions. 

Linge said, 

“Bitcoin has fluctuated between $79K and $85K over the past two weeks, reflecting heightened market volatility driven by mounting geopolitical and macroeconomic pressures. The market sentiment is tense, and trade tensions have escalated again, with new tariffs expected to be implemented on April 2nd. Today, new 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports have taken effect, prompting a swift retaliation from the European Union, which plans to impose counter measures on goods worth 26 billion euros (about £22 billion pounds) starting next month.

Heightened macro volatility and geopolitical tensions have driven investors toward safe-haven assets like the U.S. Treasuries, reflecting a broader shift toward capital preservation amid growing market uncertainty. Meanwhile, Germany's decision to raise debt to finance a military buildup has triggered a sharp selloff in German government bonds (bunds), reinforcing the flight to U.S. Treasuries as investors seek greater stability.”

Bitfinex analysts told Crypto.news, 

“Such widespread capitulation often precedes market stabilisation, though geopolitical and macroeconomic concerns remain a significant overhang.”

Dr. Sean Dawson, Head of Research at Derive.xyz told Crypto.news:

“The market is facing significant challenges as the macroeconomic environment worsens, and crypto assets are no exception. 

With bearish sentiment building, traders are turning to downside hedging strategies, especially as volatility surges across both traditional and crypto markets. The coming weeks will be critical for assessing how the broader economic situation impacts digital asset prices and trading behaviour.”

Video-sharing platform Rumble boosts its Bitcoin holdings with a 188 BTC purchase, reinforcing its commitment to a Bitcoin treasury strategy.

Rumble (NASDAQ: RUM), the video-sharing platform and cloud services provider, has announced the purchase of approximately 188 Bitcoin, valued at around $17.1 million, as part of its previously disclosed Bitcoin treasury strategy. Acquired at an average price of approximately $91,000 per coin, this purchase is a part of the company's plan to allocate up to $20 million into Bitcoin.

“We are excited to announce these purchases and allocation of Bitcoin as part of our treasury strategy as well as a larger strategic move as we further expand our ties to the crypto industry,” said Rumble Chairman and CEO Chris Pavlovski. “These holdings have the potential to serve as a valuable hedge against inflation and will not be subject to dilution like so many overprinted government-issued currencies. As a leading video and cloud services platform for the crypto community, we are proud to officially hold Bitcoin as we continue to grow and engrain crypto into our company's DNA.”

The announcement follows Rumble's previously disclosed corporate treasury diversification strategy, which was approved by its Board of Directors. The strategy aims to leverage Bitcoin as a strategic asset to accelerate the company's expansion into digital assets while strengthening its financial position.

“We believe that the world is still in the early stages of the adoption of Bitcoin, which has recently accelerated with the election of a crypto-friendly U.S. presidential administration and increased institutional adoption,” Pavlovski stated. “Unlike any government-issued currency, Bitcoin is not subject to dilution through endless money-printing, enabling it to be a valuable inflation hedge and an excellent addition to our treasury. We are also excited to strengthen our ties with crypto and to bolster our efforts to become the leading video and cloud services platform for the crypto community.”

The company noted that the actual timing and value of any future Bitcoin acquisitions will depend on various factors, including general market conditions, Bitcoin's trading price, and Rumble's anticipated cash needs. Rumble stated their strategy will remain flexible and may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time based on the company's discretion.

Modular blockchain Hemi Labs' unveiled its mainnet with $440 million in total value locked (TVL).

Hemi, founded by early Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik, plans to unify Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two oldest and largest blockchains, into "a single supernetwork," according to an emailed announcement. 

Hemi is built on both Bitcoin and Ethereum to combine the best qualities of both, taking advantage of Bitcoin's security and Ethereum's programmability. The project raised $15 million in a funding round led by Binance Labs last September.

The project is one of several looking to transform the broader blockchain landscape, particularly with regard to decentralized finance (DeFi), through combining Bitcoin and Ethereum due in part to the deep stores of value held in bitcoin (BTC), which comfortably exceed those of every other digital asset combined.

However, Bitcoin's coding lacks the ability to natively build some of the functions that DeFi requires, such as smart contracts or zero-knowledge proofs, hence the need to bridge this utility from Ethereum.

The company has signed up dozens of protocols for deployment on Hemi, including decentralized exchange (DEX) Sushi, liquid staking token pumpBTC and oracles RedStone and Pyth.

Gov. Pillen Signs Bill Creating Protections from Cryptocurrency Fraud

LINCOLN, NE — Governor Jim Pillen has signed LB609 into law. This bipartisan, law-enforcement-supported legislation establishes the Controllable Electronic Record Fraud Prevention Act to help combat fraud and protect users of cryptocurrency kiosks/ATMs.

“Cryptocurrency is an important, emerging industry — and we've been working hard to build Nebraska into a cryptocurrency leader,” said Gov. Pillen. “An important part of these efforts is to make sure that we have guardrails to prevent criminals from taking advantage of Nebraskans. We look forward to continuing to lay the groundwork for a safe and robust crypto industry in our state. This is good news for consumers."

“Nebraska is open for business in the cryptocurrency space,” said Nebraska Department of Banking Director Kelly Lammers. "That also means we need to increase transparency to assure those doing legal business in the State of Nebraska that you are absolutely welcome. Of course, those that target our citizens, that look to exploit Nebraskans and their financial resources, using Crypto ATMs as part of their transfer method, we will soon have a team that will be watching even more closely."

Rumble, a Toronto-headquartered video hosting, streamling and cloud platform, joins the corporate Bitcoin BTCUSD purchasing mania. The statement about $17.1 million Bitcoin BTCUSD added to the treasury comes 10 weeks after Tether's investment in Rumble.

$17,100,000: Video platform Rumble confirms first BTC purchase

According to its official statement, Canada's video streaming platform Rumble, disclosed its pioneering Bitcoin BTCUSD purchasing. The company has added 188 Bitcoins BTCUSD to treasury with an average price of $91,000 per coin, Rumble said in X.

In total, the company is going to allocate $20 million in Bitcoin BTCUSD, Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski said in a press release. 

The company bets big on Bitcoin BTCUSD "as a valuable tool for strategic planning and reinforces the company's expansion into cryptocurrency," the team says.

Fueled by the announcement, Rumble's RUM stocks are up by 2.7% in 24 hours on Nasdaq's premarket. However, the X followers opined that the company might be getting exposure to Bitcoin BTCUSD on too high prices.

As of press time, Bitcoin BTCUSD is changing hands at $81,633. Rumble should be 10.33% underwater, with a negative paper PnL of $1.77 million.

Rumble jumps into top 40 corporate BTC holders

With this purchase, Rumble becomes the 40th largest corporate holder of Bitcoin BTCUSD, Bitcoin Treasuries tracker says. Rumble's BTC holdings are equal to 0.60% of its net market cap.

As covered by U.Today previously, in December 2024, Rumble secured a whopping $775 million investment from Tether, the issuer of the world's largest stablecoin, USDT.

In the first batch, Tether transferred to Rumble $250 million in cash. As such, the company injected into Bitcoin BTCUSD about 7% of the first Tether transfer.

In total, publicly listed companies are responsible for over 657,000 Bitcoins BTCUSD worth $53 billion; it is 3.13% of the entire Bitcoin BTCUSD supply.

The Securities and Exchange Commission is scaling back its cryptocurrency enforcement unit. Why does this matter? Because crime pervades the crypto industry.

Just last month, a hacker stole about $1.5 billion from the crypto exchange Bybit in the biggest theft the industry has ever experienced. As this incident suggests, crypto crime seems to be getting worse, not better.

Indeed, crypto crime likely broke records last year. Illicit crypto addresses received an estimated total of $40 billion to as much as $75 billion in 2024.

Ask a generative AI program for ‘historical' footage and what you get could spell the end of documents and documentaries we can believe in.

Cryptocurrency is being used to perpetrate crimes that affect all Americans. One of the best examples is ransomware, malicious software that prevents users from accessing their computer files, systems or networks unless they pay a ransom. Crypto is the dominant form of payment demanded in these attacks because it enables cybercriminals to receive money anonymously and quickly transfer their illicit gains overseas.

Ransomware attacks reached an all-time high in 2024, targeting sectors that Americans rely on every day. In February 2024, for example, the insurer UnitedHealth Group experienced an attack that affected hospitals, doctors' offices, pharmacies and millions of patients across the nation. UnitedHealth paid a ransom of about $22 million in bitcoin.

Tech CEOs may be doing a political 180, but the majority of engineers, investors and scientists who make Silicon Valley the global center of innovation and profit vote Democratic. 

Like ransomware attacks, meme coin “rug pulls” can have many victims. A meme coin is a cryptocurrency that is inspired by a celebrity, meme or internet trend. They're highly volatile, speculative assets that are susceptible to fraud. In a rug pull, insiders buy up a large share of meme coin tokens in advance and then dump them after the price soars, leaving regular investors with tokens that are essentially worthless.

One recent example is the case of Haliey Welch, who gained internet fame as the “Hawk Tuah Girl” when she was featured in a TikTok video that went viral. In December, after parlaying her newfound celebrity into a merchandise line and podcast, she launched a meme coin. The coin's price initially surged, but its value quickly plummeted by more than 90% after a small group of owners sold off more than 80% of the token's supply. One investor wrote on social media, “I am a huge fan of Hawk Tuah but you took my life savings.”

While rug pulls dupe multiple investors at a time, many crypto crimes target individual victims. One particularly devastating crypto fraud is known as “pig butchering” or “romance baiting.” These scams involve online criminals luring their victims into fake romances and then stealing their money by inducing them to invest in cryptocurrency.

Many people lose their life savings to these scams. One California victim, Shai Plonski, said he thought he had found the “perfect woman” on Facebook. Plonski and “Sandy” traded messages about their supposedly shared interests in yoga and poetry until Plonski revealed that his business was struggling, at which point Sandy suggested he invest in crypto with her guidance. Plonski eventually put his life savings into what he thought was a cryptocurrency investment and, when he became concerned, found he couldn't withdraw his funds. He was one of more than 40,000 victims of these scams in the United States.

Another scam on the rise involves bitcoin ATMs. A scammer persuades a victim to deposit cash into a bitcoin ATM by using a QR code. The ATM then converts the cash to bitcoin that is immediately transferred to the scammer's digital wallet.

Seniors are particularly susceptible to bitcoin ATM scams. Beaufort County, S.C., which has a large senior population, reported $3.1 million in losses to crypto scams last year, including several involving bitcoin ATMs. One retired healthcare worker got a call purportedly from the sheriff's office, informing her that she had missed her jury duty and must post a $7,500 bond to remain free until her court date. She deposited the cash into a bitcoin ATM and lost the money.

These are just a few of the ways in which criminals use crypto to harm ordinary Americans. Unfortunately, there are many others, some of which are used to finance terrorism. This is why we should be strengthening our efforts to prevent crypto crime, not weakening them.

The SEC's new leaders say they don't want crypto to “be a haven for fraudsters.” Unfortunately, it already is. It's up to them and other regulators to protect the American people from the crime that pervades this industry.

Bitcoin (BTC) price hovers around $82,500 on Wednesday after recovering 5.52% the previous day. A K33 report highlights heavy sell-offs in equities and crypto markets amid rising concerns over a fragile global economy. Traders should remain cautious as the upcoming US macro data releases could bring more volatility in risky assets like Bitcoin.

Tuesday's K33 Research ‘Ahead of the Curve' report explains that equities and crypto markets have been hit with heavy sell-offs as concerns about a fragile global economy have heightened. 

Increased recession fears, US President Donald Trump's commitment to lowering 10-year bond yields, and the first swings of a bubbling trade war have pushed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to lows not seen since mid-September. Similarly, BTC reached new yearly lows of $76,555 and saw a weekly return of -5%. 

The report continues that while many Trump measures have contributed to spooking the market into heavy de-risking, the President has delivered his crypto promises by establishing a crypto working group and launching a US BTC reserve last week. This justifies BTC's relative outperformance compared to equity indices since the election.

The graph below shows the major asset returns since the election (left) and the inauguration day (right). Since the election, BTC's performance has been 13%, outperforming other asset classes. However, its performance since the inauguration (January 13 market close) has been negative 25%, the second worst-performing asset (Ethereum is -46%).

“We fundamentally disagree with pundits attributing the recent sell-off to an underwhelming US reserve,” reports a K33 analyst. 

The analyst continues, “This reserve is a watershed moment for Bitcoin. The US government has committed to hold seized assets and even explore paths to acquire more BTC in the market. This is a huge leap forward in legitimizing BTC as a global store of value and is a massive disconnect from its recent performance driven by other market forces. While global market uncertainties may need time to be resolved, we perceive current price levels and the period ahead as a solid opportunity to buy and hold BTC long-term.”

In an exclusive interview with FXStreet, Ian Balina, CEO of Token Metrics, explained that Bitcoin's decline, despite favorable regulations and rising BTC reserves, is largely driven by macroeconomic concerns, particularly tariff disputes between the United States, Canada, India, and other countries. He noted that this has prompted a shift towards liquidity, with ‘investors taking profits and adopting a more cautious stance.'

Balina also predicted continued volatility, highlighting the $70,000 support level but warning that the prevailing bearish and risk-off sentiment leaves room for further downside.

Traders and investors are closely watching the US macroeconomic data releases – the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Wednesday and the Producer Price Index (PPI) on Thursday – which could bring more volatility for risky assets like Bitcoin and shape the direction of equities and digital assets ahead of the Federal Reserve (Fed) interest rate decision on March 19.

In an exclusive interview, Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, told FXStreet, “The FOMC meeting this week will likely result in the Federal Reserve keeping rates at 4.25%-4.50%, with a neutral-to-cautious tone.”

Lee continued though a hawkish shift could emerge if inflation concerns resurface. Crypto prices like Bitcoin might stagnate or drop from their current $83,000-$76,000 range, especially if a hawkish outcome strengthens the US Dollar (USD) and yields, pressuring risk assets. 

“Even a dovish surprise like a rate cut may fail to ignite a sustained rally, given potential market skepticism and overriding macro uncertainties. At the same time, the end of quantitative tightening offers only modest support at best,” Lee explained.

Bitcoin price broke below its 200-day EMA at $85,664 on Sunday and declined 9.14% until the next day. However, BTC pushed lower, found support around the $76,600 level, and recovered 5.52% on Tuesday. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it hovers at around $82,500.

If BTC continues to correct and closes below $78,258 (February 28 low), it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $73,072.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart reads 39, pointing upwards after bouncing off from 30 on Monday, indicating fading bearish momentum and a potential shift from oversold conditions. However, the RSI must move above its neutral level of 50 for the recovery rally to be sustained.

If bullish momentum mounts, BTC could extend the recovery to $85,000.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility.

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

Key Points

Bitcoin (BTC -0.66%) and XRP (XRP 2.13%) might not seem like direct competitors, but if you're looking to allocate a finite amount of money, you'll need to choose which one to put your dollars into. In that vein, even if you're willing to invest for the long term, you should probably have a sense of which investment might be more appealing.

At least for the moment, there's an emerging area that XRP is doing great with while Bitcoin is struggling. Here's why it could make XRP the better buy.

The blockchains that host Bitcoin and XRP have multiple capabilities beyond simply tracking which coins are in which wallets and allowing holders to execute transfers.

For instance, both aim to offer the ability for investors to buy, sell, create, and track real world assets (RWAs) like real estate or commodities directly on their chains. Although the push to onboard such assets to blockchains is just getting started, in the future it could be a major driver of volume and demand for these coins and others that offer the same features. So being a more convenient chain for investors looking to deal with real world assets, especially institutional investors, big banks, and other financial institutions, is an important factor when it comes to evaluating which coin is the better buy right now.

But there isn't much of a contest here. Bitcoin's transactions can take more than an hour to clear, and they cost about $0.37 at the absolute minimum. In contrast, XRP's transactions cost a fraction of a penny and close within a few seconds. It's also already in wide use by financial institutions for the purpose of transferring money quickly and inexpensively across international borders, so there's already a big cohort of users who might be interested in trading RWAs on their chain every day.

And the non-contest is about to get even more lopsided.

On March 22, XRP's chain will get an upgrade that will give it automated market maker (AMM) functionality, which will help to make all of the transactions on its chain more efficient for users, including those who are trading real world assets with each other. Thus, the prices that buyers are demanding will be closer to the actual transaction settlement price for their asset, and the prices that sellers are offering will be too. For financial institutions, capturing those small efficiencies can add up to large sums of money, so it's likely to be a key feature that will drive them to onboard more of their assets onto XRP's chain.

In contrast to XRP, Bitcoin doesn't natively support AMMs on its main blockchain, though several workarounds have been developed on its side chains. Therefore, it's an additional set of steps for investors if they want to trade RWAs with the help of an AMM on Bitcoin because they would need to bridge their assets over to the side chain before trading. This process is too technical for most investors who might be interested in holding some assets on the blockchain, and there are not yet any streamlined ways of doing it.

On the basis of the trend toward putting real world assets on the blockchain, XRP looks superior to Bitcoin.

Nonetheless, XRP isn't the only chain in the running to capture the market for trading RWAs, and this segment is very far from maturity. In other words, it could be supplanted by a more specialized chain that does the job even better. And for a chain dedicated to being favored by financial institutions, that would be a blow, albeit not an existential threat.

Bitcoin, on the other hand, only offers this type of functionality as an afterthought, at least for the moment. So it probably isn't going to be a significant driver of its price unless that changes. It doesn't need to win against XRP, as investors seek to buy and hold it as a store of value rather than for its utility.

The reality is that both Bitcoin and XRP are likely to continue growing, and they're both worth buying and holding. Bitcoin is the more conservative choice of the two, and so for most investors, it's probably the better option. Still, it's worth getting some exposure to XRP soon just in case it wins the fight to track assets on its chain.
