US President Donald Trump has put Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky in his place and made it clear to him that Washington's goal is long-term peace between Moscow and Kiev, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has said.

American and Ukrainian delegations held talks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, during which Kiev agreed to an “immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire” with Russia proposed by Washington and expressed readiness to sign a deal granting the US access to Ukraine's critical resources “as soon as possible.”

The concessions led to Trump unblocking military aid and intelligence assistance to Kiev. The US president had previously ordered aid to be put on hold after a public clash with Zelensky in the Oval Office over the Ukrainian leader's unwillingness to look for a diplomatic solution to the conflict with Moscow.

Following the talks on Tuesday, Leavitt told Fox News that the White House was “very, very pleased with the way that the Ukrainians and this deal today turned out.”

“We hope that this will continue in a long and everlasting peace – that is President Trump's goal, and we hope we can deliver on that goal,” she added.

The spokeswoman referred to Trump as the “negotiator-in-chief,” saying that “he put Zelensky in his place and told him that the Americans are serious about a long-term peace deal.”

Trump did not travel to Saudi Arabia, while Zelensky arrived in Jeddah but did not participate in the negotiations. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, represented Washington during the talks, while the Ukrainian delegation was headed by Zelensky's chief of staff, Andrey Yermak.

Trump “is obviously very engaged and involved. He was briefed throughout the day today on the situation unfolding in Saudi Arabia,” Leavitt said.

When asked about Russia's reaction to the agreement on a ceasefire proposal reached between Washington and Kiev in Jeddah, the spokeswoman replied: “I have not been updated on the progress. I know that Secretary of State Rubio and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz are working very hard on this.”

Moscow has repeatedly said it will not accept a temporary ceasefire with Ukraine as it would only benefit Kiev and its Western backers. Russian President Vladimir Putin said in January that “the goal should not be a short truce, not some kind of respite for regrouping forces and rearmament with the aim of subsequently continuing the conflict, but a long-term peace based on respect for the legitimate interests of all people, all nations living in this region.”

US President Donald Trump has reversed course on plans to double tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, a senior White House adviser said Tuesday in an interview with CNBC.

Earlier in the day, Trump had vowed to raise tariffs on Canadian metal exports to 50%, calling it retaliation for Ontario Premier Doug Ford's decision to impose a 25% tariff on electricity exports to Michigan, New York, and Minnesota. Ford's move, in turn, was a response to Trump's initial 25% duty on Canadian steel and aluminum.

Trump hinted at a possible reversal Tuesday afternoon, and later, White House trade advisor Peter Navarro confirmed the decision on CNBC. He specified that US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick “did a beautiful job” by persuading Ford to suspend the electricity tariffs during a phone call, which also led to a commitment to resume trade talks.

In a joint statement after the call, Ford and Lutnick described their discussion as “productive” and emphasized the importance of US-Canada economic ties. They also announced plans to meet in Washington on Thursday to negotiate a renewed trade deal between the US, Canada, and Mexico ahead of Trump's April 2 tariff deadline.

Meanwhile, White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement that the initially announced 25% tariff on steel and aluminum “with no exceptions or exemptions” would take effect for Canada and all other trading partners on March 12, pursuant to Trump's previous executive orders.

In February, Trump announced plans to impose 25% tariffs on Canadian goods, prompting Ottawa to retaliate with its own import taxes on certain US products. However, the US president has since postponed the measure twice, most recently delaying its implementation until April 2.

A senior official the US Agency for International Development (USAID), Washington's primary channel for sending money to causes abroad, has reportedly directed remaining staff to destroy sensitive documents stored at the agency's former headquarters, Politico has claimed, citing an internal email.

President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, who leads the recently established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), have repeatedly accused USAID of misusing taxpayer money and fostering corruption. As part of broader efforts to cut federal spending, the agency was forced to lay off 2,000 employees and place most of the remaining staff on leave.

Acting executive secretary Erica Carr has reportedly instructed remaining staff to convene on Tuesday for an “all-day” effort to clear out classified safes and personnel documents at the Ronald Reagan Building. She advised employees to prioritize shredding documents and to use burn bags sparingly.

Felony crime!

“Shred as many documents as possible first, and reserve the burn bags for when the shredder becomes unavailable or needs a break,” the email read. “The only labeling required on the burn bags is the phrase ‘SECRET' and ‘USAID/(B/IO)' in dark Sharpie if possible. If you need additional burn bags or Sharpie markers, please let me or the SEC InfoSec team know.”

The email did not specify a reason for the destruction of the documents. However, the building is being vacated following mass layoffs, as US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recently rented 390,000 square feet of office space in the facility.

The directive has raised concerns among former USAID staff and legal experts, who argue that it could violate federal record-keeping laws and potentially hinder ongoing lawsuits challenging the agency's restructuring.

“Destruction of evidence is a crime,” Musk wrote on X in response to reports of the latest document purge. The billionaire previously called USAID a “criminal organization,” while Trump has claimed it was mismanaged by “radical lunatics.”

The handling of documents at USAID has already been under scrutiny. Last month, two of the agency's security officials were placed on administrative leave after allegedly refusing to grant a team of DOGE auditors access to classified materials.

The Trump administration plans to eliminate 90% of USAID contracts, amounting to $54 billion, AP reported last month, citing an internal White House memo and court filings. The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) has also had its government funding frozen. Although officially a US State Department-funded nonprofit that distributes grants to pro-democracy initiatives abroad, the NED has long faced allegations of acting as a CIA front for regime change operations.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has given a lengthy interview with three US bloggers who traveled to Moscow. The discussion touched on Russian relations with the administration of US President Donald Trump, the settlement of the Ukraine conflict, and other issues.

For more than 90 minutes, Lavrov answered questions from Mario Nawfal, the host of one of the most popular interview shows on X, as well as former CIA analyst and co-founder of the Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS) group, Larry Johnson, and former judge Andrew Napolitano, who previously worked for Fox News and wrote for the Washington Post and other outlets.

During the interview, Lavrov suggested that “a return to normalcy” has been emerging in the US since the start of Trump's second term at the White House.

He also reiterated Russia's readiness to look for a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine conflict, but stressed that officials in Moscow “know what must be done” to reach a settlement and “would compromise the fate of the people,” referring to Russian citizens and ethnic Russians in Ukraine.

Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) Director Sergey Naryshkin has spoken on the phone with his CIA counterpart, John Ratcliffe, with both agreeing to maintain regular contact.

During the conversation, which took place on Tuesday, the heads of the two agencies agreed to maintain a dialogue in order to “promote international stability and security, as well as to reduce tensions in relations between Moscow and Washington,” the SVR director said in a statement on Wednesday.

Naryshkin and Ratcliffe also discussed cooperation between the two agencies “on areas of mutual interest and the resolution of crisis situations.”

The Russian intelligence chief has repeatedly signaled his readiness to maintain contact with the CIA in recent years despite strained relations between Moscow and Washington. In January, just two days after Ratcliffe's appointment as CIA director was confirmed by the US Senate, Naryshkin said he was ready to meet with his US counterpart.

In 2023, the head of the SVR spoke with then-CIA Director William Burns. The two discussed the Ukraine conflict and the mutiny launched by the late founder of the Wagner private military company, Evgeny Prigozhin, which took place that summer. In May 2024, Naryshkin said further contact with Burns “cannot be ruled out.”

The news comes as both Moscow and Washington have resumed dialogue, which largely ceased under Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden, and intensified efforts to settle the Ukraine conflict.

US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he would likely to schedule a phone call with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin this week to negotiate a proposed 30-day ceasefire with Ukraine.

Trump made the remarks after Ukrainian and American delegations met in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where Kiev agreed to Washington's proposal for a ceasefire with Moscow.

The presidents' call would be their second in just a month. In an effort to broker peace between Russia and Ukraine, Trump had a 90-minute phone conversation with Putin on February 12. Both leaders agreed to start negotiations aimed at ending the conflict.

The Kremlin has yet to respond officially, but Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow-Washington contacts could not be ruled out. Kremlin pool reporter Dmitry Smirnov has suggested a presidential call could happen on Friday.

US President Donald Trump has reiterated that, so far, he has found it easier to deal with Russia than Ukraine as he seeks to broker peace between the two countries, expressing hope that Moscow would agree to a proposed 30-day ceasefire with Kiev.

Trump made the remarks at a business roundtable on Tuesday, shortly after Ukrainian and American delegations met in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where Kiev agreed to what the US leader described as a “full ceasefire” while Washington unblocked military and intelligence assistance.

“I've been saying that Russia has been easier to deal with so far than Ukraine, which is not supposed to be the way it is, but it is,” Trump said. “But we have a full ceasefire from Ukraine, and that's good… and we hope to get Russia.”

Earlier in the day, Trump told journalists that reaching such an agreement would be a major step toward a final deal to end the conflict. Otherwise, “we just keep going on,” he said, warning that “lots of people” would be killed.

“Hopefully, [Russian President Vladimir Putin] can agree to it also and we can get this show on the road,” Trump added, indicating that he may hold another phone conversation with his Russian counterpart later this week.

The Kremlin has not yet provided an official response to the statements, but Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that contacts between Moscow and Washington in the coming days could not be ruled out. Kremlin pool reporter Dmitry Smirnov has suggested that a phone call between the US and Russian presidents could take place on Friday.

Moscow has previously rejected temporary ceasefires, arguing that they would only allow Kiev to regroup and rearm. Russian officials have insisted on a permanent, legally binding solution that addresses the root causes of the conflict.

Trump had said earlier that Kiev was more difficult to deal with, recalling a heated exchange in the Oval Office that ended with Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky being told to leave prematurely. When asked by reporters on Tuesday whether Zelensky was welcome back at the White House, Trump replied, “Sure, absolutely,” noting a “very big difference” since the botched visit.

Two opposition parties in Greenland, one favoring economic development and the other advocating immediate independence, are leading in the country's parliamentary election, according to preliminary results released on Wednesday. The vote has drawn international attention, partly due to US President Donald Trump's desire to purchase the island, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark.

Greenland has long been of strategic importance due to its Arctic location and untapped mineral resources. Trump initially proposed buying it during his first term at the White House in 2019, but the move was swiftly rejected by both Denmark and Greenland. Since returning to office, he has reignited discussions about US influence, describing the island as crucial to American security and economic interests.

According to early results, the centrist Demokraatit party, which supports economic expansion and a gradual approach to independence, is leading with 29.9% of the vote, a sharp rise from 9.1% in 2021. The pro-independence Naleraq party, which has signaled openness to closer ties with the US, has secured 24.5%, nearly doubling its previous support.

The ruling Inuit Ataqatigiit party, which also supports independence but at a slower pace, stands at 21.4%, while its left-wing coalition partner Siumut has dropped to 14.7%, a significant decline from the last election, when the two parties controlled nearly two-thirds of the legislature.

The former Danish colony was granted self-rule in 1979, but Copenhagen retains control of foreign affairs, defense, and monetary policy. Stretching 2.2 million square kilometers and with a population of only about 60,000, the territory also hosts a key US military base at Thule.

The island has the option to declare full independence through a referendum but has yet to hold one, as concerns persist over economic stability. Denmark currently provides an annual subsidy that accounts for about a quarter of Greenland's economy.

Speaking at a recent joint session of Congress, Trump reaffirmed his support for Greenland's right to determine its future, suggesting the territory could break away from Denmark and join the US. The president said Washington needs the island and will secure it “one way or the other,” despite the rejection of his previous purchase offer.

The Dutch House of Representatives has voted against the European Union's multi-billion euro militarization plan, citing financial risks and a lack of clear guidelines, the Volkskrant newspaper reported on Tuesday. The rejection comes as Brussels has been urging to spike the bloc's military spending to address a perceived Russian threat.

The REARM plan was introduced by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen earlier this month and includes €150 billion in loans to EU governments for defense spending and fiscal exemptions, potentially mobilizing up to €800 billion ($870 billion) over the next four years.

However, Dutch lawmakers have warned that the plan lacks a concrete financial framework and could lead to an economic crisis. Despite Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof initially backing von der Leyen, a narrow parliamentary majority—including the Party for Freedom (PVV), New Social Contract (NSC), and the Farmer–Citizen Movement (BBB)—rejected the proposal in a vote on Tuesday. 

Lawmakers argued that the plan's reliance on joint EU loans would increase debt burdens for member states and expose them to financial risks. A representative of the NSC noted that while the party supports Ukraine aid and increased EU military budgets, it is opposed to any form of eurobonds or the expansion of budgetary standards, as proposed by the REARM plan.

The EU intensified its plans to militarize after US President Donald Trump repeatedly criticized European NATO members for failing to meet the bloc's defense spending commitments. Last month, Trump warned that the US would not automatically defend NATO allies if they did not increase their financial contributions, stating, “If they don't pay, I'm not going to defend them.”

In response, European leaders have moved to expand their military budgets with some citing a supposed Russian threat as justification for the rush. French President Emmanuel Macron had recently publicly labeled Russia as a “threat to Europe” and has suggested extending France's nuclear umbrella to other EU countries.

Moscow has repeatedly rejected having any intentions to attack NATO or EU countries and has dismissed such claims as “nonsense.” The Kremlin has also condemned the EU's plans to increase defense spending, calling it “militarization” that is “primarily aimed at Russia” and stressing that such moves are a “matter of deep concern” for Moscow.

Moscow has ample reasons to distrust Ukraine and its Western backers given their history of broken promises, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said. He accused Kiev of consistently undermining its own interests with each act of “cheating.”

Russia has “burned [its] fingers” many times dealing with the West, Lavrov said in an interview with podcasters Mario Nawfal, Larry Johnson, and Andrew Napolitano published on Wednesday.

He stated that the Ukraine crisis could be traced back to at least 2004, when the country's constitutional court “expanded, without any right, the constitutional procedures” and ordered a third round in a presidential election, resulting in a victory for a Western-aligned candidate.

The 2014 Western-backed coup in Kiev, the Minsk agreements, and the 2022 Istanbul peace talks between Russia and Ukraine were also examples of missed opportunities, Lavrov added.

”Had they [Ukrainians] been cooperative and had they delivered on their own initiative, they would still have 1991 borders, minus Crimea, minus some part of Donbass. Every time they cheat, they lose,” the minister stated.

The Turkish-mediated draft truce in 2022 would have transformed Ukraine into a neutral state with some territorial concessions. However, then-British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told Kiev “don't do it, continue to fight,” Lavrov said.

Following talks between Washington and Kiev on Tuesday, US President Donald Trump said Russia's reaction to his proposal of a 30-day ceasefire would inform him on whether Moscow genuinely wants peace.

Lavrov, however, noted that Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky had received a hero's welcome in the UK after his clash with Trump at the White House last month.

“It's an indication that they want to raise the stakes and they are preparing something to pressure the Donald Trump administration back into some aggressive action against Russia,” Lavrov said. Moscow will not compromise on “the fate of the Russian people,” he added, referring to Russian citizens and ethnic Russians in Ukraine.

Lavrov criticized the proposals by several European countries, including the UK and France, to deploy a “peacekeeping force” in Ukraine. “If NATO expansion is recognized – at least by Donald Trump – as one of the root causes [of the conflict], then the presence of the troops from NATO countries under any flag, in any capacity, on Ukrainian soil is the same threat,” he warned.

Russia's envoy to the UN has debunked EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Kaja Kallas' claim that Russian civilians “are not dying” in the Ukraine conflict.

Vassily Nebenzia denounced remarks Kallas made in February that ""Russian civilians are not dying"" as “immoral assertions” from an official peddling “fantasies.”  In 2024 alone, the Ukrainian military killed 809 Russian civilians, including 51 children, he noted.

Those killings constituted “real crimes” and not a “theatrical performance like Bucha that was staged by the Ukrainian authorities” to garner Western support, Nebenzia stated. Kiev has cited claims that Russian forces had committed a “massacre” in the town in 2022 to justify its decision to abandon peace talks, while Russia contends that the evidence was fabricated.

Speaking at a panel discussion during the Munich Security Conference, Kallas claimed that the two nations take radically different positions: “The difference is that Russian civilians are not dying. I mean Russian children and women are not dying, it's soldiers on the ground” who do, she stated.

In response, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova labeled Kallas's comments as evidence of the “degradation” of senior EU officials, asserting that the senior diplomat has reached a new low in “cynicism and immorality.”

“How can one seriously negotiate with people who have declared lies as their official position?” Zakharova questioned.

Kallas, known for her hawkish stance towards Russia, became the EU's foreign policy and security chief last December after stepping down as Estonia's prime minister under public pressure.

The number of Indian students studying in Russia increased 34% in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to data presented by the Russian Education Ministry to parliament on Monday. Meanwhile, the number of Indian students choosing to study in countries such as the US, UK, and Australia decreased.

According to the ministry's data, cited by local media, there has been a significant rise in the number of Indian students selecting Russia as their study destination over the past three years, with enrollment numbers increasing from 19,784 in 2022 to 23,503 in 2023, and then to 31,444 in 2024.

Specifically, the number of students going to the US dropped from 234,473 in 2023 to 204,058 in 2024, reflecting a 12.9% decline. This decrease was likely due to uncertainty about the future of US immigration policy in the event Donald Trump returned to the White House, the report noted.

Recently, Indians have been facing violent attacks in the US. Over a dozen young people from the country have died in America since the start of 2024. 

New Delhi's embassy and consulates have been asked to warn students about potentially dangerous areas of US cities, the minister said, adding that student welfare is “very important,” with over one million Indian citizens currently studying overseas.

Canada, another primary destination for Indian students, experienced a 41% drop in enrollment. Historically, India was one of the largest sources of international students in Canada, with 427,000 Indians enrolled in Canadian institutions as of August 2024, as reported by Business Standard.

However, the trend shifted following tensions between the two nations, when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused India of involvement in targeting Sikh separatist leaders in Canada. The activists, part of the Khalistan movement, advocates the creation of a separate Sikh nation-state in India's Punjab region. New Delhi views the movement as extremist and has banned key Khalistan groups operating primarily in Canada, the US, the UK, and Australia.

Russia deeply values its relationship with China and is committed to fulfilling all obligations to its partner, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said.

In an interview with US podcasters conducted in English released on Wednesday, Russia's top diplomat was asked to comment on claims that former President Joe Biden made a strategic blunder by pushing Russia closer to China, through Washington's response to the Ukraine conflict.

“The Americans know that we would not betray our commitments, legal commitments, but also, you know, the political commitments which we develop with the Chinese,” the top diplomat assured. “We never had the relations with China which were that good, that confidential, that long-term build and that would be enjoying support of the peoples of both countries,” he said.

The interviewers suggested US President Donald Trump's approach  replicates President Richard Nixon's historic 1972 rapprochement with China that ensured a continuation of the Sino-Soviet split.

Current circumstances are “radically different” from those of the 1970s, Lavrov insisted.

He contrasted Moscow's adherence to its promises with the West's breach of assurances made to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that NATO would not expand eastward.

“Now they say that there is no legal obligation not to expand NATO. Fine, if you can only implement your promise by court then of course you need legal obligations all over you,” the minister said. “But if you are a person of dignity, a man of dignity, if you agreed on something by political commitment you have to deliver.”

Russia regards NATO's presence on its border and the pledge to grant Ukraine membership as crucial factors in the ongoing conflict. The Trump administration has suggested that swiftly resolving the fighting in Ukraine could open avenues for mutually beneficial cooperation with Moscow. Lavrov expressed hope that a sense of normalcy would be restored to US-Russian relations, allowing the two nations to resolve their differences peacefully.

Moscow cannot yet comment on any ceasefire proposals agreed upon by the US and Ukraine during their latest talks, but is carefully studying the statements that are coming out following Tuesday's negotiations in Saudi Arabia, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. 

The talks in Jeddah, which are said to have lasted about 9.5 hours, ended with Kiev and Washington issuing a joint statement. According to the document, Ukraine is ready to agree to a 30-day ceasefire while the US is willing to resume providing intelligence and military aid to the country.

During a press briefing on Wednesday, Peskov was asked to outline Moscow's position on the proposed ceasefire and whether or not it believes it to be beneficial for Russia. The spokesman replied by urging against making any rushed statements.

He recalled that following yesterday's meeting, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Washinton's special envoy for Ukraine Mike Waltz had announced that the American side will provide “detailed information” about the essence of the conversation that took place in Jeddah. “First, we must receive this information,” Peskov stressed, noting that Moscow expects to receive these details in the coming days.

Meanwhile, Moscow is “carefully studying the statements that were made as a result” of the talks and has already familiarized itself with the text of the joint statement that was adopted in Jeddah, the Kremlin spokesman said.

Following Tuesday's talks, US President Donald Trump announced that he intends to have a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the next few days to discuss the results of the discussion in Jeddah, and expressed hope that Putin would agree to the proposed ceasefire.

Peskov, however, has stated that no phone call request has come from the American side so far, and that there are currently no plans for direct talks between Trump and Putin. At the same time, he noted that such a call could be quickly organized.

Previously, Moscow had opposed the idea of a temporary truce in Ukraine and emphasized that a settlement should not serve to provide Kiev with breathing space and an opportunity to rearm itself before resuming hostilities. Russian President Vladimir Putin has insisted that a resolution of the conflict should guarantee long-term peace.

By signaling its openness to a ceasefire, Ukraine has handed the Kremlin a difficult challenge at a time when the Russian military has the upper hand in the war: Should Moscow accept a truce and abandon hopes of making new gains, or should it reject the offer and risk derailing a cautious rapprochement with Washington?

Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly ruled out a temporary break in hostilities, saying it would only benefit Ukraine and its Western allies by letting them replenish their arsenals. He has insisted Moscow wants a comprehensive agreement that would ensure a lasting settlement.

The Kremlin responded cautiously to the news of Ukraine accepting the U.S.-proposed truce during Tuesday's talks in Saudi Arabia, saying that it needs to know details of the discussions before expressing its view.

The careful approach reflects Putin's awareness of the risk that a blunt rejection of the offer could upset tentative efforts to normalize Russia-U.S. ties.

Observers say that instead of an outright rejection, Putin will likely propose linking the truce to certain conditions that would protect Moscow's interests.

The Russian military held the battlefield initiative last year, making slow but steady gains along several sections of the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line. The tempo of Russian advances accelerated in the fall, when Moscow's forces captured the most territory since the start of the war.

Ukraine has sought to retake the initiative with a surprise foray into Russia's Kursk region that began in August, seeking to distract Moscow's forces from their offensive in eastern Ukraine and make gains that potentially could be exchanged for Russia-occupied areas in peace talks. The incursion, however, has diverted Ukrainian resources from defending the Donetsk region in the east and it failed to stem Russian advances there. Now Ukrainian forces are on the verge of losing their last remaining bridgehead in Kursk under the brunt of a swift Russian counteroffensive.

Moscow also ravaged Ukrainian energy infrastructure with waves of missiles and drones, destroying much of its power-generating capacity.

Putin has repeatedly said a temporary halt to hostilities at a time when Russian forces firmly hold the initiative would only allow exhausted Ukrainian troops a break to rest and rearm.

“As for the settlement of the situation, I would like to emphasize that it shouldn't be aimed at a brief truce — some sort of a break for regrouping troops and rearmament in order to continue the conflict — but a long-term peace,” Putin has said.

Moscow has made it clear it wouldn't accept any troops from NATO members as monitors under a prospective peace deal.

Putin key goals remain what he declared when he launched the full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022: Ukraine renounce joining NATO, sharply cut its army, and protect Russian language and culture to keep the country in Moscow's orbit. On top of that, he now wants Kyiv to withdraw its forces from the four regions Moscow has seized but doesn't fully control.

Russian officials also have said that any prospective peace deal should involve unfreezing Russian assets in the West and lifting other U.S. and European Union sanctions. The Trump administration has put a potential sanctions relief on the table.

Along with that, Putin has repeatedly emphasized the need to “remove the root causes of the crisis,” a reference to the Kremlin's demand to roll back a NATO military buildup near Russian borders it describes as a major threat to its security.

The Kremlin leader has argued that Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whose term expired last year, lacks the legitimacy to sign a peace deal. Kyiv maintains that elections are impossible to hold amid a war. U.S. President Donald Trump has spoken of the need for Ukraine to hold an election in comments that echoed Moscow's view.

Some observers noted that instead of an outright rejection of the proposed truce, Putin could put forward several conditions.

Pro-Kremlin commentator Sergei Markov suggested Moscow could agree to a truce if Ukraine's allies halt arms supplies to Kyiv. The U.S. said it resumed weapons shipments and intelligence sharing with Kyiv after it agreed to a truce Tuesday in Saudi Arabia.

“Russia could say ‘yes, but' to a ceasefire offer, accepting a 30-day truce on condition that an embargo is imposed on arms supplies to Ukraine,” Markov wrote.

Another Moscow wish is a presidential election in Ukraine, which would be possible after Ukraine lifts martial law.

“Peace would allow Russia to influence Ukrainian politics and use peaceful means to ensure friendly relations,” Markov said.

Moscow-based foreign policy expert Alexei Naumov also predicted that Russia would likely accept the ceasefire offer if it leads to an election in Ukraine.

“There is a paradox in these talks and peace initiatives – Ukraine and Russia are both vying for Donald Trump's attention and seeking to improve their positions with his help,” Naumov said in a commentary.

Sam Greene of the Washington-based Center for European Policy Analysis said it would be hard to imagine Putin saying a categoric “no” to the ceasefire proposal, adding that the Kremlin leader “has already achieved in some ways more through this negotiation process … then he achieved in a long time on the battlefield,” describing a brief halt in the U.S. military assistance to Ukraine and the talk about rolling back sanctions as “big wins” for Russia.

Putin's statements against a temporary truce mean simply that Russia is “not likely to agree to a ceasefire without extracting various things along the way,” Greene said.

“The sort of ceasefire that it might be interested in is quite clearly not the kind of ceasefire that the Ukrainians or the Europeans might be interested in, although the Americans may be more malleable on that,” he added.

“Moscow has every reason to believe that … if this process lands anywhere, it will land in a place that is more or less on Russia's terms, as long as the process is being driven by Washington,” Greene said.

PANAMA CITY (AP) — They crossed oceans to get to the U.S., fleeing conflict, religious persecution, poverty and government crackdowns in countries such as Afghanistan, Somalia, Cameroon, China, Pakistan and Iran.



After flying to Central and South America, they bused through countries where they didn't speak the language and walked through unfamiliar jungle to get to the U.S.-Mexico border.



Within days, they were detained and put on military aircraft that flew nearly 300 of them to Panama as U.S. President Donald Trump sought to accelerate deportations to more complicated destinations.



Panama was supposed to be a stopover. But for those unwilling to return home — mostly out of well-founded fear — Panama sent them to a guarded camp without access to lawyers in the same Darién jungle many had crossed months earlier on their way north.



Over the past week, under legal pressure, the Panamanian government dropped them off at a bus station in the capital with 30 days to figure out where they will go next. 



“It feels like the whole world is crushing down on me. It's like everything is stopping,” said Isha Len, a 29-year-old from Cameroon. “I risked everything, my life, everything, crossing the Darién Gap, just to be sent back.”



Here are the stories that some of the deportees told The Associated Press:

After conflict broke out in her small town, Len crossed Cameroon by car and minibus, then a fisherman friend carried her four hours by boat to Nigeria. 



Len, a schoolteacher, flew to Sao Paulo, Brazil, where she said authorities detained her for a month in the airport. From there, she wound north through South America by bus, following other migrants until they reached the Darién Gap.



She walked days through the dangerous jungle that divides Colombia and Panama before boarding buses that carried her through Central America. After being kidnapped for days by a gang in Guatemala, she crossed into southern Mexico, where she took a boat along the Pacific coast to evade authorities. After she landed, she rode eight hours to Mexico City, continuing on by bus and car to Tijuana. 



She crossed the U.S. border and presented herself to American authorities.

(AP Photo/Matias Delacroix)





Artemis Ghasemzadeh left her country in January, fleeing after converting from Islam to Christianity – something that could cost Ghasemzadeh her life in Iran. She flew to Dubai, where she stayed two weeks and then took a flight to South Korea. 



From there she flew to Mexico City, staying there for three weeks before going to Tijuana. She crossed the U.S. border on Feb. 9, and was detained for five days, including her birthday.



“For changing your religion, your punishment is death,” she said. “We don't know what will happen.”

Wang Qiu said he left home after he was imprisoned for three years for speaking out about democracy and human rights issues. 



He flew from Beijing to Cuba, then to the small South American country of Suriname. From there, he traveled by land: through Guyana, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia, before trekking through the Darién Gap. 



He moved up through Central America and Mexico before being detained after crossing into the U.S. in San Diego.

(AP Photo/Matias Delacroix)





Qamar Abdi, left for the U.S. on Aug. 17, due to warfare between the government and militants of al-Shabab, which the U.S. recognizes as a terrorist group. 



She hopped from buses to shared cars for nearly a month until she reached South Africa. From there, she flew to Sao Paulo, Brazil, and spent the next six months riding buses north. 



When she arrived at the northern tip of Colombia, she traveled six days through the Darién Gap, landing in Panama on New Year's Day. 



She took buses to the southern Mexican border city of Tapachula, where she was temporarily kidnapped and robbed by a gang. To avoid immigration authorities, she traveled hours packed on a boat with other migrants along Mexico's Pacific coast, then took a bus to Mexico City. She spent two weeks there before driving to Tijuana, where she crossed into the U.S.

(AP Photo/Matias Delacroix)





Ebrahim Ghezelgechi fled Iran with his wife, Sahar; 10-year-old daughter, Aylin; and 11-year-old son, Sam, on Nov. 21. 



The family flew to Brazil, then to Panama and finally Nicaragua. From there, they took buses north to Guatemala, then crossed into southern Mexico by boat. They road on top of trains and in buses and vans to get to Tijuana. 



After Mexico authorities sent them back to the southern part of the country, they took a plane to the resort area of Los Cabos. There, they were detained, had their passports taken and were sent back south again. 



They tried getting north a number of times, punted back by Mexican authorities, before eventually paying a driver to take them to Tijuana. 



After crossing into the U.S., they were detained in San Diego for a week.

(AP Photo/Matias Delacroix)





Samin Haider left for Dubai in 2023 after violence surged in his region of Parachinar, which borders Afghanistan and has been plagued for decades by conflicts between Shi'ite and Sunni Muslim communities. 



Haider was there for 1 1/2 years before the United Arab Emirates canceled visas for Pakistanis. 



Haider then flew to Mexico and traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border with the hopes of seeking asylum. 



Now deported to Panama, he still hopes to reach the U.S.

Elham Ghaedi left on Oct. 21, flying to Brazil and then to Venezuela's capital Caracas. 



She traveled to Colombia, where took a bus north and then walked five days through the Darién Gap. 



She stayed 15 days in a migrant camp in southern Panama before taking a bus through Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and to Mexico's southern border. There, migration authorities detained her for six days.



She traveled north to Mexico City, where she spent a month, before boarding a flight to Tijuana. U.S. authorities detained her when she crossed to San Diego.

Omagh fled Afghanistan in 2022 after the takeover of the Taliban because he identified as an atheist and was part of an ethnic minority, something that could put his life in danger. 



He first went to Pakistan, where he got a visa for six months, and struggled to get a new one due to his Afghani passport. 



He then went to Iran and worked there for 1 1/2 years. But the country wouldn't accept him as a refugee. 



He managed to get a visa to Brazil, which offered a number of Afghan people refuge after the rise of the Taliban, and flew to Sao Paulo in 2024.






Hoping to reunite with friends and family in the U.S., Omagh paid smugglers to move him north through Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia. He trekked through the Darién Gap, then took buses north through Central America to southern Mexico. 



Mexican authorities detained him and dropped him back in southern Mexico a few times before he managed to take a flight to Mexico City and later to the U.S., where he was detained. 



“After so much time, I've lost hope,” he said.

ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistan's neglected southwestern province of Balochistan has been the scene of a yearslong insurgency, with a dramatic uptick in attacks in recent years underscoring the struggles the government in Islamabad faces in dealing with myriad security threats. 

The seizure Tuesday of a passenger train by the outlawed Baluch Liberation Army, or BLA, took the insurgency to a new level with the first such large-scale operation by the militant group. 

The militants took hundreds of passengers aboard the Jafer Express hostage before Pakistani forces said Wednesday that they had killed all 50 of the attackers. The military said the assailants killed 21 passengers, and that all the remaining passengers were rescued.

Balochistan is Pakistan's largest province and the country's least populated. It's also a hub for the country's ethnic Baloch minority, whose members say they face discrimination by the government.

The separatists have fought since the early 2000s for autonomy — if not outright independence — from Islamabad and for a greater share of natural resources that the undeveloped province abounds in, such as natural gas, oil and minerals.

Over the years, the BLA has grown in strength, prompting some analysts to say the group today compares to the Pakistani Taliban in terms of the threat it poses for the country.

The BLA has regularly targeted Pakistani security forces and has also in the past attacked civilians, including Chinese nationals working on multibillion-dollar projects related to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. It has also staged attacks beyond Balochistan, including in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city.

Although the government insists it has significantly curbed violence, attacks in Balochistan have not abated. Islamic militant groups also operate in the province.

The BLA, which both Pakistan and the United States have designated a terrorist organization, is estimated to have around 3,000 fighters, promptly claimed responsibility for the attack on Tuesday. 

The group seeks to establish an independent Baloch state, encompassing territories in Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan where the Baloch ethnic group lives. 

Islamabad maintains that the BLA is getting support from neighboring India, a rival and like Pakistan, a nuclear-armed nation — though New Delhi has dismissed the allegation. The Pakistani government also claims that there is a degree of cooperation between the BLA and the country's top militant group, the Pakistani Taliban.

Analysts say the BLA has grown more emboldened since the Pakistani Taliban ended a cease-fire with the government in November 2022, encouraging more militant attacks across the country. 

Separately from the rivalry with India, Pakistan has also had a tense relationship with neighboring Iran, contributing to the insecurity in Baluchistan. 

The two countries share a 900-kilometer (560-mile) border, which remains largely ungoverned, allowing smugglers and militant groups to move about freely. Both governments accuse each other of harboring or tolerating insurgent groups.

Economic factors also drive the unrest, said Khan, the analyst, adding that it does not bode well for Pakistan's economy. 

“Who will come and invest in Pakistan if we keep seeing such attacks,” he said. 

Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative has poured billions of dollars into Pakistan but it has also alienated the Baloch minority further. They say Islamabad is exploiting Balochistan's resources while neglecting the local communities. 

However, Syed Muhammad Ali, a security analyst, said that while the train attack may have provided the BLA with “instant public and media attention,” the civilian deaths from the attack will likely “weaken their support base” among the province's population.

LISBON, Portugal (AP) — Portugal slid back into more political uncertainty Wednesday after its third government fell in as many years when Prime Minister Luis Montenegro lost a confidence vote in Parliament. 

The demise of the minority government marks the worst spell of political instability in 50 years of Portuguese democracy.

Here's a look at what led up to the vote, and what is next for the European Union country of 10.6 million people:

Montenegro submitted himself to the confidence vote after he was accused of a potential conflict of interest regarding a family law firm. It recently emerged that the firm was receiving payments from a company that has a major gambling concession granted by the government.

Montenegro, who took power less than a year ago, held the confidence vote to “dispel uncertainty.” Instead, opposition parties teamed up to topple him.

Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, who as head of state oversees the transition of power between governments led by prime ministers, is holding talks with the parties that make up the Parliament on Wednesday.

Once those talks are done, the president is expected to formally dissolve the chamber in accordance with constitutional procedures and announce new elections. Many political observers expect to ballot to be set for May.

Montenegro, who has denied wrongdoing, said he will try to regain his post by running again in the snap election.

But he faces hurdles other than the opinion of voters. Opposition parties have demanded more detailed explanations from the conservative leader, and the Socialist Party wants a parliamentary inquiry that would dog the government for months.




As a NATO member, Portugal is in need of strong leadership to help handle the diplomatic crisis unleashed by the United States, which is wavering after decades of solid support for Europe.

The Portuguese administration is also in the process of investing more than 22 billion euros ($24 billion) in EU development funds as it looks to retool its economy.

Portugal has not been immune to the wave of far-right gains across Europe. Chega (Enough), a radical right populist party, finished third in last year's election in its best ever result after it successfully tapped into voters' frustration with mainstream politics.

Antonio Costa Pinto of the Lisbon University Social Sciences Institute said that Chega could aspire to play kingmaker.

“Portuguese democracy has been marked by a minority center-right government that has made a key point of not making alliances with the radical right party, and this will also be at stake on these elections,” he told The Associated Press.

“Not that there is a prediction for the radical right to rise greatly. But at what point will the center-right party, which is in a significant crisis, break this barrier on the radical right? We don't know. Basically everything is wide open.”

Portugal hasn't experienced such political instability since it adopted a democratic system in the wake of the 1974 Carnation Revolution, which ended a four-decade dictatorship.

Once considered a model of level-headed governance, Portugal has seen its politics fragment, leading to fragile administrations. Back-to-back minority governments have been unable to forge lasting alliances with parties in opposition and have fallen well short of finishing their four-year terms.

António Costa, Montenegro's predecessor, stunned the nation when he suddenly resigned as prime minister in 2023 after a member of his staff came under investigation for corruption. Although he was not directly targeted by investigators, Costa immediately stepped down in an act of political responsibility that has earned him praise. He has since become president of the European Council.

Some citizens are growing tired of the instability.

“I have a feeling that this idea of having early elections is becoming common and people start to think it is normal. But it is not normal,” said Francisco Ribeiro, a 63-year-old plumber. “Politicians are appearing increasingly as people less honest and this confuses people.”

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — U.S. arms deliveries to Ukraine resumed Wednesday, officials said, a day after the Trump administration lifted its suspension of military aid for Kyiv in its fight against Russia's invasion, and officials awaited the Kremlin's response to a proposed 30-day ceasefire endorsed by Ukraine.



Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said it's important not to “get ahead” of the question of responding to the ceasefire, which was proposed by Washington. He told reporters that Moscow is awaiting “detailed information” from the U.S. and suggested that Russia must get that before it can take a position. The Kremlin has previously opposed anything short of a permanent end to the conflict and has not accepted any concessions.



U.S. President Donald Trump wants to end the three-year war and pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to enter talks. The suspension of U.S. assistance happened days after Zelenskyy and Trump argued about the conflict in a tense White House meeting. The administration's decision to resume military aid after talks Tuesday with senior Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia marked a sharp shift in its stance.

Trump said “it's up to Russia now” as his administration presses Moscow to agree to the ceasefire.



“And hopefully we can get a ceasefire from Russia,” Trump said Wednesday in an extended exchange with reporters during an Oval Office meeting with Micheál Martin, the prime minster of Ireland. “And if we do, I think that would be 80% of the way to getting this horrible bloodbath” ended.



The U.S. president again made veiled threats of hitting Russia with new sanctions.






“We can, but I hope it's not going to be necessary,” Trump said.



U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who led the American delegation to Saudi Arabia, where Ukraine consented to the U.S. ceasefire proposal, said Washington will pursue “multiple points of contacts” with Russia to see if President Vladimir Putin is ready to negotiate an end to the war. He declined to give details or say what steps might be taken if Putin refuses to engage.



The U.S. hopes to see Russia stop attacks on Ukraine within the next few days as a first step, Rubio said at a refueling stop Wednesday in Shannon, Ireland, on his way to talks in Canada with other Group of Seven leading industrialized nations.

Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is expected to travel this week to Moscow, where he could meet with Putin, according to a person familiar with the matter but not authorized to comment publicly. The person cautioned that scheduling could change.



Zelenskyy said the 30-day ceasefire would allow the sides “to fully prepare a step-by-step plan for ending the war, including security guarantees for Ukraine.”



Technical questions over how to effectively monitor a truce along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, where small but deadly drones are common, are “very important,” Zelenskyy told reporters Wednesday in Kyiv.

Arms deliveries to Ukraine have already resumed through a Polish logistics center, the foreign ministers of Ukraine and Poland announced Wednesday. The deliveries go through a NATO and U.S. hub in the eastern Polish city of Rzeszow that's has been used to ferry Western weapons into neighboring Ukraine about 70 kilometers (45 miles) away.



The American military help is vital for Ukraine's shorthanded and weary army, which is having a tough time keeping Russia's bigger military force at bay. For Russia, the American aid spells potentially more difficulty in achieving war aims, and it could make Washington's peace efforts a tougher sell in Moscow.



The U.S. government has also restored Ukraine's access to unclassified commercial satellite pictures provided by Maxar Technologies through a program Washington runs, Maxar spokesperson Tomi Maxted told The Associated Press. The images help Ukraine plan attacks, assess their success and monitor Russian movements.







The developments came amid intensifying Russian efforts to push Ukrainian forces out of the Kremlin's Kursk region that have yielded breakthroughs in recent days, Ukrainian soldiers told AP. The fighting has escalated as ceasefire talks come to a head, with Moscow intent on taking back its territory and Kyiv determined to hold onto it as a bargaining chip in any negotiations.



Ukrainian forces made a daring raid into the Russian region last August in the first foreign occupation of Russian territory since World War II. They have held on despite intense pressure from tens of thousands of Russian and North Korean troops.



Recent fighting reportedly has focused on the Kursk town of Sudzha, which is a key Ukrainian supply hub and operational base. Ukrainian soldiers said the situation is dynamic, and fighting continues in and around the town, but three of them conceded Russian forces were making headway.



Russian state news agencies RIA Novosti and Tass reported Wednesday that the Russian military has entered Sudzha. It was not possible to independently verify either side's claims.



Inside Ukraine, Russian ballistic missiles killed at least five civilians, officials said Wednesday.

Russian lawmakers signaled wariness about the prospect of a ceasefire.



“Russia is advancing (on the battlefield), so it will be different with Russia,” senior Russian senator Konstantin Kosachev noted in a post on the messaging app Telegram.



“Any agreements (with the understanding of the need for compromise) should be on our terms, not American,” Kosachev wrote.



Lawmaker Mikhail Sheremet told the state news agency Tass that Russia “is not interested in continuing” the war, but at the same time Moscow “will not tolerate being strung along.”



The outcome of the Saudi Arabia talks “places the onus on Washington to persuade Moscow to accept and implement the ceasefire,” said John Hardie, a defense analyst and deputy director of the Russia program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based research institute.

“Moscow will present itself as cooperative, but may push for agreement on basic principles for a final peace deal before agreeing to a ceasefire,” he said.



“Russia may also insist on barring Western military aid to Ukraine during the ceasefire and on Ukraine holding elections ahead of a long-term peace agreement.”



Russia's foreign intelligence service, known as the SVR, reported Wednesday that the service's chief, Sergei Naryshkin, spoke on the phone Tuesday with CIA Director John Ratcliffe.



The two discussed cooperation “in areas of common interest and the resolution of crisis situations,” according to a statement by the SVR.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was turned over Wednesday to the custody of the International Criminal Court, following his arrest on a warrant accusing him of crimes against humanity over deadly anti-drugs crackdowns he oversaw while in office.

The 79-year-old former president arrived at Rotterdam The Hague Airport in the Netherlands earlier Wednesday on a flight from Manila, following his arrest there on an ICC request on Tuesday.

Rights groups and families of victims hailed Duterte's arrest, and the court's chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, called it “a crucial step in our continuous work to ensure accountability for the victims of the most serious crimes under ICC jurisdiction.”

Supporters of Duterte criticized the administration of current Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, Duterte's political rival, for arresting and surrendering the former leader to a court whose jurisdiction his supporters dispute. 

The Dutch-based court said in a statement that medical assistance was made available ‘'as a precautionary measure'' at the airport for Duterte, in line with standard procedures when a suspect arrives. The court did not comment on his state of health.

An ambulance drove to the hangar where his plane was taken, and medics wheeled a gurney inside. A police helicopter hovered close to the airport, and later a black SUV was seen leaving the airport accompanied by police. Its destination was not immediately clear. Crowds gathered outside the detention center for ICC suspects.




Within days, Duterte will face an initial appearance where the court will confirm his identity, check that he understands the charges against him and set a date for a hearing to assess if prosecutors have sufficient evidence to send him to a full trial.

If his case goes to trial and he is convicted, Duterte could face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.

“This is a monumental and long-overdue step for justice for thousands of victims and their families,” said Jerrie Abella of Amnesty International. 

“It is therefore a hopeful sign for them, as well, in the Philippines and beyond, as it shows that suspected perpetrators of the worst crimes, including government leaders, will face justice wherever they are in the world,” Abella added.

Emily Soriano, the mother of a victim of the crackdowns, said she wanted more officials to face justice.

“Duterte is lucky he has due process, but our children who were killed did not have due process,” she said.

While Duterte's plane was in the air, grieving relatives gathered in the Philippines to mourn his alleged victims, carrying the urns of their loved ones. “We are happy and we feel relieved,” said 55-year-old Melinda Abion Lafuente, mother of 22-year-old Angelo Lafuente, who she says was tortured and killed in 2016.

Duterte's supporters, however, criticized his arrest as illegal and sought to have him returned home. Small groups of Duterte supporters and people who backed his arrest demonstrated on Wednesday outside the court before his arrival.

The ICC opened an inquiry in 2021 into mass killings linked to the so-called war on drugs overseen by Duterte when he served as mayor of the southern Philippine city of Davao and later as president.

Estimates of the death toll during Duterte's presidential term vary, from the more than 6,000 that the national police have reported and up to 30,000 claimed by human rights groups.

ICC judges who looked at prosecution evidence supporting their request for his arrest found “reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. Duterte is individually responsible for the crime against humanity of murder” as an “indirect co-perpetrator for having allegedly overseen the killings when he was mayor of Davao and later president of the Philippines,” according to his warrant.

In its statement Wednesday, the ICC outlined the technical stages of the upcoming hearing, without setting a specific date, and thanked Philippine authorities ‘'for their commitment to upholding international accountability mechanisms.''

Duterte could challenge the court's jurisdiction and the admissibility of the case. While the Philippines is no longer a member of the ICC, the alleged crimes happened before Manila withdrew from the court.

That process will likely take months and if the case progresses to trial it could take years. Duterte will be able to apply for provisional release from the court's detention center while he waits, though it's up to judges to decide whether to grant such a request.

Philippines-based GMA Integrated News posted a video Wednesday of Duterte that it said was taken while he was on the plane. “To my countrymen, just to give you the current situation,″ he said in a statement combining English and Tagalog. “This will be a long legal proceedings. I say to you, I will continue to serve you.″

Duterte's legal counsel, Salvador Panelo, told reporters in Manila that the Philippine Supreme Court “can compel the government to bring back the person arrested and detained without probable cause and compel the government bring him before the court and to explain to them why they (government) did what they did.”

Marcos said Tuesday that Duterte's arrest was “proper and correct” and not an act of political persecution. 

Duterte's daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte, criticized the Marcos administration for surrendering her father to a foreign court, which she said currently has no jurisdiction in the Philippines.

She left the Philippines on Wednesday to arrange a meeting in The Hague with her detained father and talk to his lawyers, her office told reporters in Manila.

Duterte withdrew the Philippines in 2019 from the ICC, in a move human rights activists say was aimed at escaping accountability.

The Duterte administration moved to suspend the global court's investigation in late 2021 by arguing that Philippine authorities were already looking into the same allegations, arguing that the ICC — a court of last resort — therefore didn't have jurisdiction.

Appeals judges at the ICC rejected those arguments and ruled in 2023 that the investigation could resume.

The ICC judges who issued the warrant also said that the alleged crimes fall within the court's jurisdiction. They said Duterte's arrest was necessary because of what they called the “risk of interference with the investigations and the security of witnesses and victims.”

British officials were concerned about possible environmental damage Tuesday and looking for answers a day after a cargo ship carrying a toxic chemical hit a tanker transporting jet fuel for the U.S. military off eastern England, setting both vessels ablaze.

LONDON (AP) — The captain of a cargo ship that collided with a U.S. tanker is a Russian national who remains in U.K. police custody, the vessel's owner said Wednesday, as it emerged that the ship failed several safety checks last year.

The 59-year-old man, who hasn't been named by authorities, was arrested by police in northeast England Tuesday on suspicion of manslaughter by gross negligence over the collision. He hasn't been charged.

Shipping company Ernst Russ, which owns the Portugal-flagged cargo vessel Solong, said that the ship's 14 crew were a mix of Russian and Filipino nationals.

U.K. authorities say they have found no evidence of foul play in the crash, and there is nothing so far to indicate that it's connected to national security. Humberside Police said that detectives were conducting inquiries alongside partner agencies.

AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports the captain of a cargo ship that collided with a U.S. tanker is a Russian national who remains in U.K. police custody, as it emerges the ship has failed several safety checks.

The U.K. Marine Accident Investigation Branch is also involved in investigating what caused the Solong, bound from Grangemouth, Scotland, to Rotterdam, Netherlands, to hit the stationary tanker, which was anchored about 10 miles (16 kilometers) off the English coast.

The investigation is being led by the U.S. and Portugal, the countries where the vessels are flagged.

Port inspection documents show the Solong failed steering-related safety checks in Dublin, Ireland, in July, with the vessel's “emergency steering position communications/compass reading” unreadable. Inspectors found a total of 10 deficiencies, including “inadequate” alarms, survival craft “not properly maintained” and fire doors “not as required.”




An inspection in Scotland in October found two other deficiencies. The ship wasn't detained after either inspection.

The cargo ship collided Monday with MV Stena Immaculate, a tanker transporting jet fuel for the U.S. military in the North Sea off eastern England on Monday, setting both vessels ablaze. One sailor from the Solong is missing and presumed dead. The other 36 crew members from the two vessels were brought safely ashore, with no major injuries.

The Solong was drifting and still smoldering Wednesday, but is likely to remain afloat rather than sinking, officials said.

The 183-meter (596-foot) Stena Immaculate was operating as part of the U.S. government's Tanker Security Program, a group of commercial vessels that can be contracted to carry fuel for the military when needed.

The collision sent jet fuel pouring into the sea and sparked fears of significant environmental damage. Environmentalists said that oil and chemicals posed a risk to sea life, including whales and dolphins and to birds, including puffins, gannets and guillemots that live on coastal cliffs.

The U.K. coast guard agency said that no new pollution had been reported since the initial incident, and environmental campaigning group Greenpeace said the impact on marine life may not be as bad as first feared.

“We're not quite out of the danger zone yet, but it's starting to look like an environmental disaster may have been narrowly averted,” said Paul Johnston from the Greenpeace Research Laboratories. “When a container ship the length of a football pitch rams into a tanker carrying thousands of tons of jet fuel at 16 knots close to sensitive nature sites, the potential for serious harm is huge.”

NUUK, Greenland (AP) — A party that favors a gradual path to Greenland's independence from Denmark won a surprise victory in parliamentary elections, held in the shadow of U.S. President Donald Trump's stated goal of taking control of the island.

The center-right Demokraatit Party has pushed back against Trump's rhetoric, saying it is for Greenlanders to decide the future of the strategically important territory, which holds large reserves of the rare earth minerals needed to make everything from mobile phones to renewable energy technology. The Arctic island is also home to a U.S. air base and straddles strategic air and sea routes in the North Atlantic.

The result should send a clear message to Trump that Greenland is not for sale, Demokraatit leader Jens-Friederik Nielsen told Sky News. 

“We don't want to be Americans. No, we don't want to be Danes. We want to be Greenlanders. And we want our own independence in the future. And we want to build our own country by ourselves, not with his hope,” he said.

Trump has been outspoken about his desire to control Greenland, telling a joint session of Congress last week that he thought the U.S. was going to get it “one way or the other.”




A break from Denmark wasn't on the ballot, but it was on everyone's mind. Greenland was colonized 300 years ago by Denmark, which still exercises control over foreign and defense policy.

The island of 56,000 people, most from Indigenous Inuit backgrounds, has been on a path toward independence since at least 2009, and the 31 lawmakers elected will shape the island's future as it debates whether the time has come to declare independence.

Four of the five main parties in the race sought independence, but disagreed on when and how.

Second-place finisher Naleraq is the most aggressively pro-independence, while Demokraatit favors a more moderate pace of change.

“What approach to independence will win the day will ultimately depend on if Demokraatit decides to form a coalition government, and if so, with which party,” said Dwayne Menezes, managing director of the Polar Research and Policy Initiative.

Demokraatit won nearly 30% of the vote, compared to just 9% in the election four years ago, Greenlandic Broadcasting Corporation KNR TV reported, while Naleraq came in second with almost 25%, up from nearly 12% in 2021.

Demokraatit's upset victory over parties that have governed the territory for years indicated many in Greenland care just as much about social policies such as health care and education as they do about geopolitics. 

Nielsen, 33, appeared to be surprised by his party's gains, with photos showing him sporting a huge grin and applauding at the election party.

He said that Greenland needs to stand together “in a time of great interest from outside,” KNR TV reported.

Danish broadcaster DR reported that Nielsen said his party would reach out to all other parties to negotiate the future political course for Greenland.

Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen congratulated the Demokraatit party and said the future Greenlandic government would likely have to “deal with massive pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump,” according to DR.

He added that “it's not the case that you can just take part of the Danish Realm — the future of Greenland is based on what the Greenlandic people and government want,” DR reported.

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, meanwhile, called the election “a joyful day and a celebration of democracy” in a statement Wednesday. She congratulated Demokraatit and said the Danish government would await the results of coalition negotiations.

Prime Minister Mute Bourup Egede had called the vote in February, saying the country needed to be united during a “serious time” unlike anything Greenland has ever experienced.

On Wednesday, after the results were known, Egede thanked voters in a Facebook post for turning out and said the parties were ready to turn to negotiations to form a government.

His party, Inuit Ataqatigiit, or United Inuit, received 21% of the vote. This is a significant decline from the last election, when the party came in strongest with 36% of the vote, according to KNR TV. 

Inuit Ataqatigiit had been widely expected to win, followed by Siumut — two parties which had dominated Greenland's politics in recent years.

Siumut came in fourth with 14% of the vote.

The Baloch Liberation Army group has claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was open to negotiations to swap prisoners. So far, there has been no response from the government to the offer from the insurgents.

QUETTA, Pakistan (AP) — Insurgents who attacked a passenger train in Pakistan killed 21 hostages, the military said Wednesday, while security forces rescued over 300 others and killed all 50 of the assailants.

The military spokesman, Lt. Gen. Ahmad Sharif, told local media that three soldiers who had been guarding the track were also killed in the attack that began Tuesday in restive Balochistan province.

Security officials said troops rescued 346 hostages and the operation had concluded. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.

The province's chief minister, Sarfraz Bugti, told a provincial assembly that troops killed all insurgents involved.

The separatist Baloch Liberation Army claimed responsibility for attacking the train carrying 440 passengers in a tunnel in a remote part of Balochistan. Spokesman Jeeyand Baloch had said the group was ready to free passengers if authorities agree to release jailed militants.

AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports Pakistani security forces have exchanged gunfire with separatist militants as they seek to free hundreds of hostages aboard a train in the country's rugged southwest.

Officials did not immediately account for the remaining passengers.

The BLA regularly targets Pakistani security forces and has also attacked civilians, including Chinese nationals among the thousands working on multibillion-dollar projects in Balochistan related to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.

Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said her country “will continue to firmly support Pakistan in advancing its counterterrorism efforts.”

Some relatives of hostages were angry at Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, who last year claimed that the BLA was not a threat and “an ordinary police inspector could fix this situation.”




The train had been traveling from Quetta to the northern city of Peshawar. Officials say the Jafer Express train was partially inside a tunnel when the militants blew up the tracks, forcing the engine and nine coaches to stop.

Oil- and mineral-rich Balochistan is Pakistan's largest and least populated province. It's a hub for the country's ethnic Baloch minority, whose members say they face discrimination and exploitation by the central government.

Balochistan, which borders Iran and Afghanistan, has long been the scene of insurgency. Separatists demand greater autonomy from the government in Islamabad and a larger share of the region's natural resources.

Insurgencies on either side of the Iran-Pakistan border have frustrated both countries. Their governments suspect each other of supporting — or at least tolerating — some of the groups. Iran has sought help from Pakistan in countering the threat from the militant group Jaish al-Adl. Pakistan wants Tehran to deny sanctuaries to BLA fighters.

Trains in Balochistan typically have security personnel on board, as members of the military frequently use trains to travel from Quetta to other parts of the country. In November, the BLA carried out a suicide bombing at a train station in Quetta, killing 26 people.

The BLA had warned that the hostages' lives would be at risk if the government did not negotiate.

Analysts said the attack and its focus on civilians could backfire.

“After failing to damage the Pakistan Army within Balochistan, BLA has shifted its targets from military to unarmed civilians. This may give them instant public and media attention, but it will weaken their support base within the civilian population, which is their ultimate objective,” said Syed Muhammad Ali, an Islamabad-based independent security analyst.

Rescued passengers, including women and children, were being sent to their hometowns. Some of the injured were taken to Quetta, the provincial capital, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) away.

Shams Ullah Khan said two relatives were taken hostage. Another man, Hamad Khan, said his brother was a hostage. Families were desperate for information.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The International Criminal Court where detained former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte will face justice after his arrest in the Philippines is a court of last resort for the most serious international offenses, such as genocide and crimes against humanity. 

The 79-year-old former president has become the first former Asian leader to be arrested by the global court. Duterte arrived Wednesday in the Netherlands after his arrest the previous morning on an ICC warrant accusing him of crimes against humanity over deadly anti-drug crackdowns he oversaw while in office.

Supporters of Duterte argue that the court does not have jurisdiction to put the former president on trial, in part because Duterte withdrew the Philippines from the court in 2019. But judges who issued his arrest warrant say that the alleged crimes he is charged with happened before that withdrawal, meaning the court has jurisdiction.

The ICC handles allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and aggression, and takes on cases when nations are unable or unwilling to prosecute crimes on their territory.

The court's newest member, Ukraine, formally joined in January, bringing the number of member states to 125. Major powers — the United States, Russia and China — are among nations that are not members.

The ICC, which has a budget this year of more than 195 million euros ($213 million), does not have a police force and has to rely on the cooperation of states to arrest suspects.




Judges at the court have issued 60 arrest warrants and convicted 11 people. Congolese warlord Thomas Lubanga was the first, sentenced in 2012 to 14 years in prison for conscripting child soldiers.

In 2021, the court convicted Ugandan commander Dominic Ongwen of dozens of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including multiple killings and forced marriages in Uganda. Ongwen was a one-time child soldier who morphed into a brutal commander of a notorious rebel group known as the Lord's Resistance Army.

Three verdicts are pending. Former Central African Republic soccer federation president Patrice-Edouard Ngaïssona and Alfred Yekatom, alleged leaders of a predominantly Christian rebel group in the Central African Republic, are accused of multiple counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

The trial of Ali Mohammed Ali Abdul Rahman Ali, who is accused of committing atrocities as the leader of the Janjaweed militia in Sudan, wrapped up last year.

The court's detention center is housed behind the high brick walls of a Dutch prison complex in The Hague seaside suburb of Scheveningen, about a mile (1.5 kilometers) from the court's headquarters.

Detainees have access to books, television and news, as well as a gym and sports facilities. They also can use a computer to work on their defense case and get computer training, if they need it. The court also arranges for family members to visit people in its custody.

Photos on the ICC website show a communal area with a foosball table, kitchen facilities, a table and chairs. The center also has a small medical facility.

Each cell contains a bed, desk, cupboard, toilet, hand basin, television and an intercom system to contact guards when the door is locked.

If Duterte goes to trial and is convicted, he would not serve his sentence in The Hague but be transferred to a prison in another country.

The detention center currently houses five other suspects; Mahamat Said Abdel Kani, Yekatom, and Ngaïssona from the Central African Republic, Al Hassan Ag Abdoul Aziz Ag Mohamed Ag Mahmoud from Mali and Abdul Rahman from Sudan.

The ICC has issued arrest warrants for dozens of suspects since it was established in 2002. Among them are Russian President Vladimir Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

The court issued a warrant for Putin two years ago, accusing him of personal responsibility for the abductions of children from Ukraine. He has rejected the accusations.

In November, the court's judges issued warrants for Netanyahu, his former defense minister and Hamas' military chief, accusing them of crimes against humanity in connection with the war in Gaza. Netanyahu condemned the warrant against him, saying Israel “rejects with disgust the absurd and false actions” by the court. The case against the Hamas military leader has been terminated because he is believed to have been killed.

Other suspects wanted by the ICC include former Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and Joseph Kony, leader of the shadowy Ugandan militia Lord's Resistance Army.

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Wednesday that U.S. tariffs on Australian steel and aluminum were unjustified, but his government would not retaliate with its own tariffs.

MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Wednesday that U.S. tariffs on Australian steel and aluminum were unjustified, but his government would not retaliate with its own tariffs.

U.S. President Donald Trump said last month he was considering a tariff exemption for Australia, a free trade treaty partner that has traded with the United States at a deficit for decades.

A former Australian government secured an exemption with the previous Trump administration in 2018 based on arguments including that Australian steelmaker BlueScope employs thousands of workers in the U.S.

Albanese said he would continue to pursue an Australian exemption. The 2018 exemption took several months to secure.

“It has been foreshadowed that no country regardless of its relationship with the United States has been granted an exemption. Such a decision by the Trump administration is entirely unjustified,” Albanese said.

“Tariffs and escalating trade tensions are a form of economic self-harm and a recipe for slower growth and higher inflation. They are paid by the consumers. This is why Australia will not be imposing reciprocal tariffs on the United States,” Albanese added.

The U.S. officially increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25% on Wednesday.

The U.S. decision not to exempt Australia was announced days after a spat became public between Trump and the former Australian prime minister who secured the 2018 exemption, Malcolm Turnbull.




Trump described Turnbull, who quit politics in 2018 after being overthrown as prime minister by his own government, as a weak and ineffective leader.

“Malcolm Turnbull, the former Prime Minister of Australia who was always leading that wonderful country from ‘behind', never understood what was going on in China, nor did he have the capacity to do so,” Trump wrote on social media.

“I always thought he was a weak and ineffective leader and, obviously, Australian's (sic) agreed with me!!!” Trump added.

Trump was responding to an interview Turnbull gave this week to U.S. media company Bloomberg in which the former Australian leader said Chinese President Xi Jinping would take advantage of the U.S. president's chaotic and erratic leadership.

“I think China will take advantage, massive advantage of Trump,” Turnbull told Bloomberg.

“What my prediction will be that President Xi will aim to be the exact opposite of Trump. Where Trump is chaotic, he will be consistent. Where Trump is rude and abusive, he'll be respectful. Where Trump is erratic, he will be consistent,” Turnbull said.

“And what that will do is build trust with countries, and there'll be many countries who will, you know, looking at China on the one hand and Trump on the other, will find China a more attractive partner,” Turnbull added.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Yemen's Houthi rebels warned shippers early Wednesday that “any Israeli vessel” traveling through nearby Mideast waters is now a target as Israel continues to block aid to the Gaza Strip. 

The warning from the Houthis again throws into chaos a crucial maritime waterway between Asia and Europe, threatens revenue from Egypt's Suez Canal and possibly will halt aid shipments to war zones. The rebels in the past have also had a loose definition of what constitutes an Israeli ship, meaning other vessels could be targeted as well.

The statement from the Houthis' Humanitarian Operations Coordination Center follows a four-day deadline set by the rebels for Israel to resume aid shipments. 

“We hope it is understood that the actions taken by the (Houthi military) ... stem from a deep sense of religious, humanitarian and moral responsibility toward the oppressed Palestinian people and aim to pressure the Israeli usurper entity to reopen the crossings to the Gaza Strip and allow the entry of aid, including food and medical supplies,” the statement said. 

It described the warning as taking hold in the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Arabian Sea.

The statement added: “Any Israeli vessel attempting to violate this ban will be subject to military targeting in the declared operational area.”

There was no immediate sign of an attack on ships. Israel's military did not respond to a request for comment.

Israel earlier this month halted all aid coming into the Gaza Strip and has warned of “additional consequences” for Hamas if the fragile ceasefire in the war isn't extended as negotiations continue over starting a second phase of the pause in fighting. The move drew intense international criticism as even before the war the over 2 million Palestinians living in Gaza relied on international aid, something that's only intensified after a grinding Israeli military offensive destroyed the enclave.

The maritime security firm Ambrey warned the statements from the Houthis were “ambiguous,” likely putting more ships at risk.

It's “likely to have extended once more toward ships partially owned by Israeli individuals or entities, vessels managed and/or operated by Israeli individuals or entities, vessels heading to Israel and to ships of companies that call Israel,” the firm said.

There was no direct threat made against the U.S. Navy, whose Bahrain-based 5th Fleet patrols the Mideast. However, the earlier Houthi campaign saw American and Western warships repeatedly targeted, sparking the most-serious combat the Navy had seen since World War II.

The aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman and other ships associated with its carrier group are operating in the Red Sea now. The U.S. military said Wednesday that its forces in the region “remain vigilant.”

“We will do what is necessary to protect and defend U.S. personnel, assets and partners,” it said.

The rebels' secretive leader, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, warned Friday that attacks against Israel-linked vessels would resume within four days if Israel didn't let aid into Gaza. That deadline passed Tuesday. 

The rebels had targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors during their campaign targeting ships from November 2023 until January of this year. 

The attacks greatly raised the Houthis' profile as they faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting any dissent and aid workers at home amid Yemen's decadelong stalemated war that's torn apart the Arab world's poorest nation.

QUETTA, Pakistan (AP) — Pakistani insurgents attacked a passenger train carrying several hundred people as it passed through a tunnel on Tuesday and claimed to have taken more than 100 hostages, though officials later said at least 104 were rescued. The fate of the other passengers wasn't immediately known.




Security officials said the attackers blew up the railroad track in southwestern Balochistan province, and exchanged fire with security guards aboard the train while using women and children as human shields.

Officials said some passengers, including women and children, were wounded in the attack.

The train was traveling from the provincial capital, Quetta, to the northern city of Peshawar when it came under attack in Bolan district, government spokesman Shahid Rind said, calling it “an act of terrorism.” Rind said access to the area wasn't easy because of the rugged, mountainous terrain.

The separatist Baloch Liberation Army known as the BLA, which has waged a yearslong insurgency, claimed responsibility and said the hostages included members of the security forces who had been on board.

Pakistani officials did not confirm that security forces were captured. Trains in Balochistan typically have security personnel on board.

In a statement, BLA spokesman Jeeyand Baloch said the group was ready to free passengers if the government agrees to release the group's jailed militants. Government officials weren't immediately available to discuss the offer, but authorities have rejected such offers in the past. Pakistan and the United States have designated the BLA as a terrorist organization.




Officials at Pakistan Railways said the Jafar Express train was carrying an estimated 500 passengers.

Three security officials told The Associated Press that troops rescued at least 104 passengers, including 31 women and 15 children, and 16 attackers had been killed. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak to the media.

President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in separate statements denounced the attack.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres strongly condemned the attack and called for the immediate release of the hostages, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.

Oil- and mineral-rich Balochistan is Pakistan's largest and least populated province. It's a hub for the country's ethnic Baloch minority, whose members say they face discrimination and exploitation by the central government.

Separatists have previously carried out deadly attacks on trains there. In November, a separatist group carried out a suicide bombing at a train station in Quetta that killed 26 people.

Pakistani authorities and analysts estimate that the BLA has around 3,000 fighters. BLA regularly targets Pakistani security forces, but has also attacked civilians as well as Chinese nationals working on multibillion-dollar projects related to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC.

BLA has enhanced its operational capability, and that “means that BLA has access to funding and weapons,” according to Abdullah Khan, a senior defense analyst and managing director of the Islamabad-based Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.

OKUMA, Japan (AP) — The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant's radiation levels have significantly dropped since the cataclysmic meltdown in Japan 14 years ago. Workers walk around in many areas wearing only surgical masks and regular clothes.

It's a different story for those who enter the reactor buildings, including the three damaged in the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. They must use maximum protection — full facemasks with filters, multi-layered gloves and socks, shoe covers, hooded hazmat coveralls and a waterproof jacket, and a helmet.

As workers remove melted fuel debris from the reactors in a monumental nuclear cleanup effort that could take more than a century, they are facing both huge amounts of psychological stress and dangerous levels of radiation.

The Associated Press, which recently visited the plant for a tour and interviews, takes a closer look.

A remote-controlled extendable robot with a tong had several mishaps including equipment failures before returning in November with a tiny piece of melted fuel from inside the damaged No. 2 reactor. 

That first successful test run is a crucial step in what will be a daunting, decades-long decommissioning that must deal with at least 880 tons of melted nuclear fuel that has mixed with broken parts of internal structures and other debris inside the three ruined reactors.

Akira Ono, chief decommissioning officer at the Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which manages the plant, says even the tiny sample gives officials a lot of information about the melted fuel. More samples are needed, however, to make the work smoother when bigger efforts to remove the debris begin in the 2030s.




A second sample-retrieval mission at the No. 2 reactor is expected in coming weeks. 

Operators hope to send the extendable robot farther into the reactor to take samples closer to the center, where overheated nuclear fuel fell from the core, utility spokesperson Masakatsu Takata said. He pointed out the target area as he stood inside the inner structure of the No. 5 reactor, which is one of two reactors that survived the tsunami. It has an identical design as No. 2. 

Radiation levels are still dangerously high inside the No. 2 reactor building, where the melted fuel debris is behind a thick concrete containment wall. Earlier decontamination work reduced those radiation levels to a fraction of what they used to be.

In late August, small groups took turns doing their work helping the robot in 15- to 30-minute shifts to minimize radiation exposure. They have a remotely controlled robot, but it has to be manually pushed in and out.

“Working under high levels of radiation (during a short) time limit made us feel nervous and rushed,” said Yasunobu Yokokawa, a team leader for the mission. “It was a difficult assignment.”

Full-face masks reduced visibility and made breathing difficult, an extra waterproof jacket made it sweaty and hard to move, and triple-layered gloves made their fingers clumsy, Yokokawa said.

To eliminate unnecessary exposure, they taped around gloves and socks and carried a personal dosimeter to measure radiation. Workers also rehearsed the tasks they'd perform to minimize exposure.

The mission stalled early on when workers noticed that a set of five 1.5-meter (5-foot) pipes meant to push the robot into the reactor's primary containment vessel had been arranged in the wrong order. 

A camera on the robot also failed because of high radioactivity and had to be replaced.

The workers' highest individual radiation dose was more than the overall average but still far below anything approaching a 100-millisievert five-year dose limit. 

Even so, a growing number of workers are concerned about safety and radiation at the plant, said Ono, the decommissioning chief, citing an annual survey of about 5,5,00 workers. 

In 2023, two workers splashed with contaminated sludge at a water treatment facility were hospitalized, though they had no health problems.

Yokokawa and a plant colleague, Hiroshi Ide, helped in the 2011 emergency and are team leaders today. They say they want to make the job safer as workers face high radiation in parts of the plant.

On the top floor of the No. 2 reactor, workers are setting up equipment to remove spent fuel units from the cooling pool. That's set to begin within two to three years.

(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko)



At the No. 1 reactor, workers are putting up a giant roof to contain radioactive dust from decontamination work on the top floor ahead of the removal of spent fuel.

To minimize exposure and increase efficiency, workers use a remote-controlled crane to attach pre-assembled parts, according to TEPCO. The No. 1 reactor and its surroundings are among the most contaminated parts of the plant.

Workers are also removing treated radioactive wastewater. They recently started dismantling the emptied water tanks to make room to build facilities needed for the research and storage of melted fuel debris.

After a series of small missions by robots to gather samples, experts will determine a larger-scale method for removing melted fuel, first at the No. 3 reactor.

Experts say the hard work and huge challenges of decommissioning the plant are just beginning. There are estimations that the work could take more than a century. The government and TEPCO have an initial completion target of 2051, but the retrieval of melted fuel debris is already three years behind, and many big issues remain undecided.

Ide, whose home in Namie town, northwest of the plant, is in a no-go zone because of nuclear contamination, still has to put on a hazmat suit, even for brief visits home. 

“As a Fukushima citizen, I would like to make sure the decommissioning work is done properly so that people can return home without worries,” he said.

TORONTO (AP) — Canada will announce Canadian $29.8 billion ($20.7 billion) in retaliatory tariffs in response to the 25% steel and aluminum tariffs that U.S. President Donald Trump has leveled, a senior Canadian government official said Wednesday. 

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak before the announcement. 

The European Union on Wednesday also announced retaliatory trade action with new duties on U.S. industrial and farm products, responding within hours to the Trump administration's increase in tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25%.

        This marks a shift from previous Angola-led peace talks, which excluded M23 and instead focused on Rwanda's role in the conflict.
    

Angola announced on Tuesday that it will act as a mediator in the ongoing conflict between the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group, according to a statement released by the Angolan president's office.

Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi went to Angola to explore the possibility of a peace process. The statement confirmed that Luanda will begin establishing contact with both Kinshasa and M23 rebels, with direct negotiations set to take place in the coming days.

This move marks a change in Angola's approach, as previous peace talks hosted by Luanda had excluded M23, focusing instead on engagement with Rwanda.

M23 is one of nearly 100 armed groups operating in mineral-rich eastern DR Congo, where conflict has created one of the world's worst humanitarian crises, displacing more than 7 million people.

According to UN experts, M23 is backed by an estimated 4,000 Rwandan troops and has, at times, threatened to advance more than 1,600 kilometres to DRC's capital. 

In a rapid three-week offensive, M23 seized control of Goma, the largest city in the nation, and captured Bukavu, the second-largest, last month.

Amid the intensifying conflict, the UN Human Rights Council has launched an investigation into allegations of serious human rights violations by both sides, including rape and “summary executions”.

        Washington announced it would resume sending military supplies to Ukraine following talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday.
    

The US has resumed sending weapons supplies to Ukraine, officials confirmed on Wednesday. 

The returned flow of weapons comes after the US and Ukraine issued a statement following discussions on Tuesday in which Ukraine said it accepted a US proposal for an immediate 30-day ceasefire. 

Following the talks, the Trump administration announced it had lifted its suspension of military support. 

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on Wednesday that he was ""happy"" that Ukraine backed the process, and the focus was now on Russia's answer. 

He maintained that the focus was on making sure ""actual diplomacy"" was happening but that it was important that Ukraine could create a deterrent against future aggression. 

Rubio added that if Russia agreed to the proposals, ""we'll have to determine is who do both sides trust to be on the ground to sort of monitor some of the small arms fires and exchanges that could happen.""

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha also confirmed that weapons supplies had resumed on Tuesday as one of the key outcomes of the US-Ukraine talks in Saudi Arabia. 

Additionally, Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski announced that US weapons supplies to Ukraine had resumed to previous levels via the Rzeszów-Jasionka logistics hub in Poland.

The Trump administration's move to allow military support is a 180-degree shift from just a week ago, when it imposed measures halting the flow of arms deliveries and intelligence between Kyiv and Washington in an apparent effort to push Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy into talks on accepting a deal regarding Russia's war. 

On Tuesday, Rubio said it was now up to Moscow to accept the ceasefire agreement, telling reporters: ""the ball is in the (Russians') court.""

The Kremlin did not immediately provide detailed comment on the ceasefire proposal, which, according to Zelenskyy, would mean halting missiles, drones, and bombs in both the Black Sea and along the entire frontline. 

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Moscow was waiting for information from the US side, which he expected would be communicated through ""various diplomatic channels in the coming days.""

Russian lawmaker Konstantin Kosachev claimed on Telegram that, as Russia was advancing on the battlefield, a deal for Moscow would be different than one agreed to by Ukraine with the US. 

“Any agreements (with the understanding of the need for compromise) should be on our terms, not American,” Kosachev wrote.

Yemen's Houthi rebels warned on Wednesday that “any Israeli vessel” passing through nearby waters would now be a target for attacks should Israel not lift its blockade of food and aid to the Gaza Strip. 

Their statement, from the Houthis' Humanitarian Operations Coordination Centre, said that the actions taken by the Houthi military aimed to ""pressure the Israeli usurper entity to reopen the crossings to the Gaza Strip and allow the entry of aid, including food and medical supplies.” 

It added the group's actions stemmed from a ""deep sense"" of responsibility toward the Palestinian people.

The Houthis, seeking to stop Israel's offensive in Gaza, have repeatedly attacked cargo ships in the waters connecting Asia with Europe and the US. 

The rebels have previously adopted a broad definition of Israeli-linked ships, raising concerns that other vessels may also be targeted in the process. 

The group specified that the warning applies to ships in the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, and the Arabian Sea, adding: “Any Israeli vessel attempting to violate this ban will be subject to military targeting in the declared operational area.”

Despite the announcement, there was no immediate sign of an attack on vessels.

The Houthi warning comes after Israel suspended all aid deliveries to Gaza this month, in an effort to pressure Hamas into releasing the remaining Israeli hostages held in the territory. 

The move has drawn strong international criticism, as Gaza's over 2 million residents were already heavily reliant on international aid before the war, a dependence that has only intensified following Israel's military offensive.

Maritime security firm Ambrey cautioned that the Houthis' vague wording could place more ships at risk, stating that the threat “likely extends to ships partially owned, managed, or operated by Israeli individuals or entities, vessels heading to Israel and to ships of companies that call Israel.”

Although the statement did not contain a direct threat against the US Navy, previous Houthi operations have targeted American and Western warships, leading to some of the most intense naval combat seen since World War II.

US military officials said in a statement on Wednesday that they “remain vigilant”. “We will do what is necessary to protect and defend US personnel, assets, and partners,” they added. 

The latest warning follows an ultimatum issued by Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi last Friday, who vowed to resume attacks on Israeli-linked vessels unless Israel resumed aid deliveries to Gaza within four days. That deadline expired on Tuesday.

From November 2023 to January 2024, the Houthis attacked over 100 commercial vessels using missiles and drones, sinking two ships and killing four sailors.

These assaults have significantly raised the Houthis' profile, even as they face economic struggles and continue a crackdown on dissent and aid workers amid Yemen's decade-long war.

        As pressure mounts on Ahmed al-Sharaa's government following massacres over the weekend, Syrian authorities announce the formation of a national investigation committee. However, the international community remains sceptical about its independence.
    

As pressure mounts on Ahmed al-Sharaa's government following massacres over the weekend, Syrian authorities announce the formation of a national investigation committee. However, the international community remains sceptical about its independence.

In response to the reportedly violent repression of an uprising on the Syrian coast and in anticipation of the possible increase of Western sanctions against his country, interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa confirmed in a recent interview that sanctions already imposed on Syria are hindering his government's ability to restore stability and security.

The interim Syrian leader added that the escalation of violence in his country is linked to attacks behind the loyalists of the Bashar al-Assad regime and a foreign state, without providing supporting evidence.

Syrian authorities have announced a committee to investigate and hold accountable those involved in the violence against Alawites and minorities in the coast. 

On the formation of this body, al-Sharaa stressed that those involved will be brought to justice ""even if they are close to us,"" before highlighting his government's commitment to achieving justice and not allowing the current situation to turn into ""an opportunity for revenge"" for past grievances.

However, the Syrian president also refused to disclose the identity of those involved in the recent killings, saying only that the security authorities are working to uncover the truth and bring those responsible to justice.

His recent comments are a far cry from his rhetoric of pursuing ""remnants of the al-Assad regime"" when violence broke out last Thursday. 

This seismic shift begs the question of whether this a genuine commitment to the pursuit of justice, or just a ploy to stop further sanctions?

At the end of the first week of March, Syria's two coastal governorates of Latakia and Tartus witnessed horrific violence that resulted in over 1,000 deaths, including a large number of civilians, according to the independent UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. 

Initially, Syrian authorities focused on ""eliminating armed groups affiliated with the former regime."" 

In an official statement, al-Sharaa asserted that the security forces were ""fighting a necessary battle against al-Assad's remnants who seek to destabilise the country."" 

However, field reports published by human rights organisations and international media gave a different account, describing ""sectarian cleansing massacres"" and confirming ""mass executions and forced displacement of Alawite civilians,"" a minority ethnic group making up around 15% of Syria's population. 

Syria's former rulers, Bashar al-Assad and his father Hafez both hail from the group, which has led to accusations of “revenge killings,” after al-Sharaa and his Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group toppled the al-Assad regime in December 2024.

The violence in early March suggests the honeymoon period for the new authorities has worn off, as Syria enters a critical phase of renewed challenges to governmental authority with the potential for unrest to boil over.

What happened along Syria's Mediterranean coast has turned into a political and humanitarian crisis, sparking widespread international criticism, especially after reports, videos and live testimonies of dozens of massacres against Alawite civilians spread across the internet.

Some of those most openly pressuring the al-Sharaa government to take concrete steps to ensure there is no impunity for perpetrators of the violence are the EU and US.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the events as ""a massacre that cannot be condoned,"" calling for ""an independent international investigation to identify those responsible for these crimes"". 

Washington also warned that ""any failure to achieve justice could expose the Syrian government to US sanctions"".

For its part, the European Union issued a strongly worded statement emphasising that ""failure to hold the perpetrators of the massacres accountable will lead to the suspension of political and economic support to the new government.""

Germany and France — of which the latter invited al-Sharaa for an official visit when he rose to power in December — also demanded the inclusion of international observers in any investigation committee to ensure its transparency, which was echoed by UN Secretary General António Guterres.

There is evidence that this criticism — especially from Western governments weighing up sanctions — has pressured al-Sharaa and his government into launching an investigation, which observers hope will be independent and transparent.

However, this has led some to view the move as ""more a response to pressure than a real commitment to accountability,"" especially as al-Sharaa concurrently tries to dodge internal accusations of being subservient to international demands.

When launching the initiative, al-Sharaa announced his government ""will not relent in holding accountable anyone proven to be involved in crimes against civilians"".

However, this was met with skepticism by international and human rights groups with some accusing it of being a cynical measure to absorb international outrage without actually holding those involved accountable.

Although tentatively welcoming the announcement, the US State Department stressed that it will ""closely monitor the implementation of the commission's work and its findings,"" while French and German authorities claimed, ""the Syrian transitional government has a direct interest in exonerating certain actors"".

At the same time, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International expressed serious doubts about the commission's ability to work freely, stating that it ""lacks impartiality, as it includes figures close to the security services.""

Not everyone was so pessimistic: Moscow and Beijing welcomed the formation of the committee, arguing that ""Syria is capable of investigating the events without outside interference,"" further dividing international positions on the issue.

As the debate over the integrity of the investigation continues, al-Sharaa faces the real threat of greater international isolation of his transitional government, at a time when the economy remains dangerously weak and when 90% of the population live below the poverty line.

Yet he also has to please a panoply of conflicting internal alliances, many of whom have roots in Western-proscribed terrorist organisations — which the EU, US and UN considered HTS to be until December — who refuse to as they see it capitulate to Western powers. 

This leaves the interim leader with few options. He could proceed with the internal committee without international oversight, which may increase international scepticism and expose Syria to greater political and economic pressure externally, but satiate some internal groups.

On the other hand, al-Sharaa could agree to involve UN monitors, which would help it gain international legitimacy, but open the door to internal criticism from hardliners in the government. 

There is also the option to simply do as little as possible: procrastinating on providing tangible results, hoping that international interest in the issue will wane over time. It could play in his favour, but is a risky strategy which could equally anger all sides.

In many ways, al-Sharaa's response to recent unrest reflects a common problem for governments born out of uprising and revolutions, the tension of trying to court skeptical global powers, while concurrently trying to combat internal factionalism.

As much as the EU, the US and allies want immediate results, the current situation has thrown up more questions than answers. 

Meanwhile, al-Sharaa has reached a point where he will need to prove he is serious about fulfilling his promises to gain the trust of the international community, or Syria will find itself facing increasing isolation, analysts believe.

Over the past decade, the geopolitical landscape between the United States and the European Union has undergone significant changes. The once-stable transatlantic alliance is experiencing fractures, driven by shifting US policies and Europe's push for greater autonomy. This evolving relationship is evident in responses to international crises, such as the war in Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East, as well as Europe's renewed focus on military capabilities.For more stories from The Media Line go to themedialine.org A transatlantic divide: The US steps back, Europe moves forwardHistorically, Washington has led, with Brussels following its direction. However, recent years have disrupted this dynamic, particularly during the Trump administration. Mattia Diletti, a researcher in the Department of Communication and Social Research at La Sapienza University in Rome, argues that the shift is not due to Europe pulling away but rather to the US stepping back.  “It is not Europe that dissociates itself from the United States, but it is the United States that dissociates itself from Europe, from NATO,” Diletti told The Media Line. “This administration has decided to intervene in a transformative way on the liberal order that the United States has shaped after the Second World War.”This change reflects a broader departure from the post-World War II multilateral system, moving toward a more transactional approach based on spheres of influence. AdvertisementAs Diletti explains: “What is changing is the system of international relations with the abandonment of a multilateral system based on international institutions led by the United States, toward another model based on spheres of influence.”US President Donald Trump makes an announcement about an investment from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), in the Roosevelt Room at the White House in Washington, DC, US, March 3, 2025. (credit: REUTERS/LEAH MILLIS/FILE PHOTO)The Ukraine war: Europe fills the US voidThe shift in US engagement is most evident in Ukraine. With Washington showing hesitancy in sustaining its support, Europe has been compelled to take a more active role in Kyiv's defense. Steven Terner, an American geopolitical analyst, describes this transition.“Europe is going to pick up the slack that the United States is dropping,” he told The Media Line. “So Europe will continue to support Ukraine, and it'll support Ukraine probably even more than the US was, because it's afraid of being left without the United States entirely.”   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Yet, the consequences of reduced US involvement extend beyond military aid.  AdvertisementTerner warns that Washington's reluctance to fully back Ukraine is weakening its global standing: “The risk is the United States is simply losing geopolitical influence by not supporting Ukraine. It's losing credibility with Europe, and it's losing credibility with all of its allies internationally. And Europe is taking over the influence that the United States is backing out of.”Rearming Europe: A new military power emergesIn response to these geopolitical shifts, European nations have significantly increased their defense spending. The European Union has announced an ambitious $800 billion plan for security and military development. Diletti sees this as a crucial step, though one that remains largely theoretical.“We are evoking a future of an autonomous Europe politically and militarily, but from a practical and material point of view, we are far from it,” he said.  Despite growing defense budgets, he remains skeptical about Europe's ability to act decisively: “The transformation of political Europe, for me, is like a soap bubble. Europe must change its approach to decision-making. Otherwise, all this movement risks becoming a soap bubble.”The Middle East: Europe and the US on diverging pathsBeyond Ukraine, differing approaches to Middle Eastern conflicts further illustrate the widening gap between the US and the EU. The Trump administration's stance on Israel and Palestine, particularly regarding the Gaza crisis, clashed with European leaders, who supported an Egyptian-led peace initiative.Terner points to Europe's limited ability to enforce its policies: “Even though Europe supports the Arab and Egyptian plan, it doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be implemented, because they can't implement it without Israel.”Similarly, Diletti questions whether Europe has ever wielded real influence in the region: “Clearly, it is an attempt to gain autonomy and to reason in terms of reasonable terms. But the question remains: Have Europeans ever really had much influence in this region?”A New world order?The growing divide between the US and Europe is forcing both to reconsider their roles in global affairs. While Europe pushes for strategic independence, the US appears increasingly focused on a transactional foreign policy, treating alliances as negotiable rather than essential.As Terner observes: “Everywhere that the United States pulls out of will be filled by somebody else. There's a power vacuum, and it's going to be filled.”For now, Europe seems ready to step into that gap. Whether it can truly establish itself as a dominant geopolitical force or remain hindered by internal divisions remains uncertain.

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Wednesday rejected the idea of holding negotiations with the United States over a nuclear deal, as a letter arrived from US President Donald Trump calling for such talks.Trump said last week he had sent a letter to Khamenei proposing nuclear talks but also warning that ""there are two ways Iran can be handled: militarily, or you make a deal,"" preventing Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons.  The letter was handed over to Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi on Wednesday by Anwar Gargash, diplomatic adviser to the president of the United Arab Emirates.While Araqchi and Gargash were meeting, Khamenei told a group of university students that Trump's offer for talks was ""a deception aimed at misleading public opinion,"" state media reported. Advertisement""When we know they won't honor it, what's the point of negotiating? Therefore, the invitation to negotiate ... is a deception of public opinion,"" Khamenei was quoted as saying by state media. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei looks on during a meeting with Iranian students in Tehran, Iran, March 12, 2025. (credit: Office of the Iranian Supreme Leader/WANA (West Asia News Agency)/Handout via REUTERS)Khamenei said negotiating with the Trump administration, which he said has excessive demands, ""will tighten the knot of sanctions and increase pressure on Iran."" In 2018, Trump withdrew the United States from Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy. Tehran reacted a year later by violating the deal's nuclear curbs.Khamenei, who has the final word in Iranian state matters, said last week that Tehran would not be bullied into talks with ""excessive demands"" and threats.

Israeli law prescribes that couples have to marry through the religious courts – a Jewish couple at the rabbinical court, a Christian couple at the Ecclesiastical court, and so on. The law also prescribes that the only way to dissolve a marriage is through divorce at the religious courts, since they hold exclusive authority over divorce in Israel.This fact causes young couples to reconsider their course of action before marrying. During 2024, approximately 36,000 Jewish couples were married through the rabbinate, while 11,542 couples divorced through it.  However, recently published data indicates that couples are slowly distancing themselves from the rabbinate: According to data collected by the nonprofit Hiddush – For Religious Freedom and Equality, Israel has become a world leader in Zoom weddings performed by the State of Utah. Out of all applicants, 5,316 are Israeli, comprising one-third of applications from outside the United States.For many couples, this is an efficient, quick, and cheap alternative, allowing them to get married from home. After this procedure, the couple can register as married at the Interior Ministry, without needing to travel abroad, and seemingly without having to involve the rabbinate.  AdvertisementAnother way to marry outside of a rabbinical court is to travel abroad and marry according to the laws of the destination location, whether that be the Czech Republic, Cyprus, New York, or Las Vegas, which have become popular destinations. An illustrative image of two golden rings.  (credit: INGIMAGE)Despite the enormous popularity of the quick and easy “Zoom weddings,” and in general for couples choosing to bypass the rabbinate – the divorce procedure, in case the couple wishes to separate, still has to take place under the rabbinate's arcane laws. The manner of dissolution cannot be formulated in a spousal agreement or prenuptial financial agreement; couples cannot undertake to “divorce by another way,” or choose to dissolve their marriage legally by any other means.The government's coalition agreements already include the intention to extend the authority of rabbinical courts. For a while now, the coalition has been advancing an amendment to the law, which passed in the ministerial committee for legislation this past Sunday.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  It authorizes rabbinical courts to discuss child alimony, even without the consent of the other spouse – an authority that was not there before, and was even blocked by the High Court of Justice in a precedential ruling about a month ago. Advertisement'A dangerous initiative'This dangerous initiative led by the government – due to its animosity toward the legal system, among other things – while extending the rabbinical courts' monopoly over all matters of family disputes, may harm children's rights, make the process even longer and more cumbersome, severely harm women's rights within the divorce process, and exacerbate the problem of agunut (women “chained” to their marriage), as well as inequality following financial disputes between spouses.Against all of this stands an equitable and adequate alternative that allows any couple in Israel to start a family without the religious court's involvement at any stage – the institution of “common law marriage.” The state defines such couples as those who live as spouses in full partnership and raise a family together.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said that the United States will have contact with Russia on Wednesday about the agreement reached with Ukraine on a 30-day ceasefire and steps toward ending the war.

""We all eagerly await the Russian response and urge them strongly to consider ending all hostilities,"" Reuters quoted Rubio as saying during a stop in Ireland after US-Ukraine talks in Saudi Arabia.

“If they say no, then obviously we'll have to examine everything and sort of figure out where we stand in the world and what their true intentions are. I think it'll be if they say no, it'll tell us a lot about what their goals are and what their mindset is,” he added.'

The United States agreed to to resume military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine after Kyiv said it was ready to support Washington's proposal for a 30-day ceasefire with Russia, Reuters quoted the joint statement by the two countries.

After more than eight hours of talks with Ukrainian officials in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Marco Rubio said the US would now take the offer to Russia, and the ball is in Moscow's court.

""Our hope is that the Russians will answer 'yes' as quickly as possible, so we can get to the second phase of this, which is real negotiations,"" Rubio told reporters, referring to US President Donald Trump.

Rubio said Washington wanted a full agreement with both Russia and Ukraine ""as soon as possible.""

""Every day that goes by, this war continues, people die, people are bombed, people are hurt on both sides of this conflict,"" he said.

How Moscow would respond was far from certain.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has already said he is open to discussing a peace deal, but he and his diplomats have repeatedly stated they are against a ceasefire and would seek a deal that safeguards Russia's long-term security.

Putin told his Security Council on January 20 that there ""should not be a short truce, not some kind of respite for regrouping forces and rearmament to subsequently continue the conflict, but a long-term peace.""

He has also ruled out territorial concessions and said Ukraine must withdraw fully from four Ukrainian regions claimed and partly controlled by Russia.

NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore are expected to return to Earth by March 16 following their lengthy stay on the International Space Station (ISS). Due to technical problems with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, their mission, which was originally only supposed to span ten days, ended up lasting almost ten months. 

On March 12, the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft, which will bring them back to Earth, is scheduled to be launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on a Falcon-9 rocket.

The current Crew-9 expedition aboard the flying laboratory will be substituted with four NASA astronauts as part of the Crew-10 mission when the Dragon spacecraft lifts off.

Ahead of their return, experts have warned that it will not be a normal homecoming. Williams and Wilmore will face difficulties to adapt to Earth's gravity.

Speaking to NewsNation Prime, Leroy Chiao, a former NASA astronaut, explained the challenges.

According to him, astronauts experience “baby feet” after extended space travel. 

“You basically lose the thick part of your skin,” stated Chiao, stressing that weightlessness causes foot calluses to diminish.

Human feet, or the soles, are perhaps the most bizarre consequence of living in environments that are nearly weightless.

Moreover, dizziness and nausea are other side effects that astronauts encounter after returning home.

“To me, it feels like kind of like having the flu. It takes a couple of weeks to get back to normal,” he stated.

Astronaut Terry Virts equated the sensation to the flu. “I felt really heavy and really, really dizzy,” he stated.

After coming back from space, the body needs weeks to acclimate.

Williams and Wilmore were supposed to stay on ISS for their eight-day mission. However, they remained on ISS following issues in Boeing Starliner spacecraft.

Their prolonged stay raised worries regarding their health and even provoked political discussion. US President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk blasted the Biden administration over delay in their return.

Pakistan's forces on Wednesday refrained from launching frontal attacks inside a train hijacked by the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) militants. Despite the authorities' efforts, 250 passengers are still being held hostage.

Pakistan's junior interior minister told GEO TV that the security operation was complicated because of the remote location of the train and concerns about hostage safety. The militants are wearing vests loaded with explosives and are sitting next to the passengers.

The BLA derailed the train in a tunnel in Bolan in Pakistan's Balochistan province on Tuesday. Its spokesman Jeeyand Baloch has asked Pakistan to release jailed militants in exchange for the passengers.

30 militants had been killed on Tuesday, and around 190 passengers of the total 450 were rescued. Helicopters were backing up Pakistani forces in the rugged region. Rescued passengers were being sent to their hometowns and the injured were being treated at hospitals in the Mach district.

Muhammad Ashraf, who was on the train, said some of the passengers died in the attack, including the train driver.

BLA militants with bombs strapped to their bodies were sitting next to other passengers, a security source told Reuters.

""The militants have made some suicide bombers sit right next to some hostage passengers,"" he added.

The group has said it will execute the hostages if Pakistan doesn't release prisoners.

""Comrades are shedding their blood for you, for this motherland,"" one of its fighters on the train said in a Telegram message that urged people in mineral-rich Balochistan to join the group's fight against Pakistan's government.

A Reuters journalist, meanwhile, saw nearly 100 vacant coffins at Quetta railway station, where more of those aboard the Jaffer Express were expected to arrive.

""So far, 190 passengers have been rescued, and 30 terrorists have been killed. Due to the presence of women and children with suicide bombers, extreme caution is being exercised,"" security sources told AFP.

Several passengers told AFP that gunmen checked their IDs and killed security personnel.

NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Barry “Butch” Wilmore, who have been stranded in space for more than nine months, are scheduled to return to Earth in mid-March. 

After their spacecraft experienced significant technical issues upon arriving at the International Space Station (ISS), a space mission that was originally planned to last only seven days was extended indefinitely. The most recent information indicates that NASA astronauts should return to Earth's gravity by March 16.

Astronauts are subjected to unusual and harsh circumstances while in space, such as radiation, microgravity, and emotional distress, all of which can have long-term consequences for the wellness of individuals. 

Williams' prolonged stay at the ISS has exposed her to some significant health issues. According to scientists, exposure to hazardous space radiation is one of the most serious health dangers that Williams could encounter, TheHealthSite reported.

Space has a far harsher environment than Earth, particularly with regard to the human body. In contrast to space, the environment of the Earth and magnetic field shield the bodies of humans from dangerous solar and cosmic radiation.

Radiation exposure is a proven carcinogen that raises the risk of developing cancer. Cancer is more likely to strike astronauts who spend extended periods of time at the International Space Station (ISS). The solar radiation and extremely dangerous cosmic rays found in space cause serious alterations that can cause cancer in addition to damaging DNA.

According to NASA, ISS astronauts are exposed to roughly 20 times as much radiation as a person on Earth.

Exposure over time can increase the risk of tumors that are solid and malignancies like leukemia, as per TheHealthSite. According to experts, Williams may face lifelong cancer risk due to her extended exposure to such radiation.

In order to reduce these hazards, NASA closely monitors the radiation exposure of astronauts and caps the total dosage throughout the course of their careers.

Another major worry for astronauts who spend a lot of time in space is the impact of microgravity on the brain. Body fluids flow upward toward the head when gravity is absent, increasing the pressure within the skull.

This phenomena may cause headaches, abnormalities in vision, and possibly long-term structural changes in the brain.

Previous studies have shown that brain volume and structure of astronauts' brains change after their prolonged stay on the ISS, according to studies. Moreover, extended exposure to microgravity causes the condition, called Spaceflight-Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS), which includes alterations in brain morphology and swelling of the optic nerves.

Additionally, scientists have seen decline in white matter, which facilitates interaction between the brain's multiple parts. This may cause cognitive deficits, memory problems, and information processing challenges. Some astronauts suffer from vestibular disorders, which impair spatial orientation and balance.

Despite being a seasoned astronaut with over 322 days of space experience under her belt, Williams may be more susceptible to long-term neurological repercussions from her prolonged exposure on the ISS. While long-term research is still being conducted, it's crucial to remember that a majority of astronauts recover from these alterations after returning to Earth.

Security forces in Pakistan have rescued 190 train passengers who were taken hostage by separatist militants in the country's southwestern Balochistan province, reports news agency AFP. The rescue operation, which entered its second day, was hampered by the presence of suicide bombers among the militants, forcing authorities to exercise extreme caution.

""Due to the presence of women and children with suicide bombers, extreme caution is being exercised,"" the sources told AFP, adding that 30 militants have been killed.

The militant group responsible for the attack, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), hijacked the train on Tuesday as it entered a tunnel in Bolan district.

The group, known for its insurgency against the Pakistani state, surrounded the hostages with suicide bombers and demanded the release of jailed militants in exchange for the passengers. Government officials have not responded to the demand, adhering to their longstanding policy of rejecting negotiations with militant groups.

Pakistani security forces engaged in intense battles with the heavily armed insurgents, killing at least 30 militants so far. Helicopters were deployed to assist ground troops in the rugged terrain, while officials described the incident as an act of terrorism. In total, over 190 of the estimated 450 passengers have been rescued so far, with operations ongoing.

The attack marks the first known instance of the BLA successfully hijacking a train. The group has previously targeted security forces and infrastructure but has also attacked civilians, including Chinese nationals involved in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). China has condemned the attack, with foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning reaffirming Beijing's support for Pakistan's counter-terrorism efforts.

The train was immobilized when militants detonated explosives on the tracks, damaging the engine and its nine coaches, say security officials. The driver was critically wounded by gunfire, and the security guards onboard were attacked.

The rescued passengers, including women and children, have been transported to their home towns or hospitals in Mach district and Quetta, located 100 kilometers away. The train had been traveling from Quetta to Peshawar when it was seized.

Balochistan, a resource-rich yet restive province, has long been a hub of separatist movements demanding greater autonomy and a larger share of its natural resources. The BLA, one of the key insurgent groups in the region, has waged a prolonged campaign against Pakistani forces, often targeting infrastructure projects linked to China's Belt and Road Initiative.

Freed hostages from a train hijack in southwestern Pakistan on Tuesday recounted walking for hours through tough mountain terrain to escape, leaving behind separated relatives.

The ordeal began when militants, fighting for Balochistan's independence, blew up a railway track in a remote part of the region, halting the train and taking over 450 passengers hostage.

“I can't find the words to describe how we managed to escape. It was terrifying,” AFP quoted Muhammad Bilal as saying.

Bilal was on the Jafar Express with his mother when the train was caught in an explosive attack, leaving at least three people dead.

More than 100 hostages have been released, but the train is still under the control of militants.

“I heard an explosion, followed by gunshots, as militants stormed the train,” Allahditta, a passenger, told AFP at the Mach train station, which has been converted into a makeshift hospital to treat the injured.

“People began hiding under the seats in panic. The militants separated the men from the women. They allowed me and my family to go because I told them I'm a heart patient,” the 49-year-old added.

“We walked for a long time through the mountains to reach the nearest station. I haven't eaten since I began fasting this morning, but I still can't bring myself to eat,” Allahditta added, in reference to the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

A passenger recounted how gunmen went through identity cards to identify those from outside the province, resembling recent attacks by the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), which has taken responsibility for the siege.

“They came and checked IDs and service cards and shot two soldiers in front of me and took the other four to, I don't know where,” said one passenger who asked not to be named, after walking four hours to the nearest train station.

“They checked IDs, and those who were Punjabis were taken away by the terrorists,” he added.

The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) alleges that the region's natural resources are being exploited by outsiders and has escalated attacks on Pakistanis from other regions in response.

Survivors made their way through rugged terrain on Tuesday night to reach the nearest train station, eventually travelling to Mach, roughly 200 kilometres (124 miles) from the Iran border.

The first trains carrying the survivors arrived later in the evening, greeted by paramilitary forces and medical personnel.

“I am treating two (police) officers; one was shot five times, while the other was wounded in his knee,” said paramedic Qazim Farooq.

The Trump administration has terminated $800 million in grants to Johns Hopkins University, spurring the nation's top spender on research and development to plan layoffs and cancel health projects, from breast-feeding support efforts in Baltimore to mosquito-net programs in Mozambique.

 The cuts, which are in addition to threatened trims to National Institutes of Health grants, are related to the university's work with the U.S. Agency for International Development. The school is preparing to shrink its Baltimore-based affiliated nonprofit, JHPIEGO, that since the 1970s has worked closely with the USAID and has already stopped work on a number of international health projects.  The economy in Baltimore city, where the university anchors the innovation sector and is the area's largest private employer, is likely to see more ripple effects as a result, according to local groups. It is a preview of what university administrators across the country expect at their campuses if the Trump administration prevails in court challenges and continues to target institutions of higher education through cuts to federal grants. The administration already canceled $400 million in grants and contracts to Columbia University last week over the university's handling of pro-Palestinian demonstrations, part of a series of recent moves aimed at institutions. “Johns Hopkins has bet very heavily on a century and a quarter of partnership with the federal government,” said Dr. Theodore Iwashyna, a critical-care physician at Johns Hopkins who is currently overseeing an NIH grant to study how best to send pneumonia patients home so they don't end up re-hospitalized. “If the federal government decides it doesn't want to know things anymore, that would be bad for Johns Hopkins and devastating for Maryland.” The White House didn't respond to requests for comment. Johns Hopkins's work received scrutiny from Department of Government Efficiency leader Elon Musk on his X platform last month, when he remarked on the closure of a transgender health clinic in India that the school helped run. “That's what American tax dollars were funding,” he wrote. Universities are already challenging some of the Trump administration's cuts to institutions. In February, 13 schools including Johns Hopkins sued health agencies over a plan to severely cut how NIH support dollars for research, known as “indirect costs,” are awarded. The university stands to lose another $200 million if the cuts go through, a university administrator estimated in court filings. The NIH cuts are on pause while the legal challenge, from various universities, medical centers, and multiple state attorneys general, plays out. Johns Hopkins was founded in 1876 “to foster independent and original research” and now spends more than $3 billion annually on that effort—more than any other U.S. school, according to data from the National Science Foundation. Scientists at the school invented cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR, confirmed the authenticity of the Dead Sea Scrolls, introduced the rubber glove to surgery and landed the first spacecraft on an asteroid. Twenty-nine people with links to the institution have won Nobel Prizes. Now the sprawling institution is among big U.S. research centers bracing for wide-ranging changes. Nearly half of the school's incoming funds last year were from research done on behalf of the federal government, said Johns Hopkins President Ronald Daniels said in a March 4 letter. “The breadth and depth of this historic relationship means that cuts to federal research will affect research faculty, students, and staff and will ripple through our university,” he wrote. Protesters at the USAID building last month. The nonprofit JHPIEGO worked to improve health in more than 20 countries in Africa, nine countries in Asia and Ecuador and Guatemala. A long list of Johns Hopkins' USAID-funded projects have already been halted, including a nearly complete eight-year effort with half a billion dollars in funding to convince people in more than 50 countries to adopt behaviors such as sleeping under mosquito nets in Mozambique, breast-feeding in Baltimore and using contraception in Nigeria. Another project halted: An effort to provide chlorine tablets and soapy water and messages about good hygiene to help prevent diarrhea deaths in Bangladesh. “A lot of what has been broken in the last six to eight weeks is not repairable,” said Dr. Judd Walson, who chairs the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health's department of international health, which oversaw the Bangladesh hygiene project. “It's going to look very very different structurally, and it's going to look very different in terms of our financial model.” The local impact would reach far and wide: In 2022, Johns Hopkins affiliates accounted for over 93,600 jobs and over $15 billion in economic output in Maryland, according to the figures in the institution's latest economic impact report. Cuts to research “would be devastating for the commercial ecosystem and the innovation ecosystem in Baltimore,” said Mike Rosenbaum, a university trustee and founder and CEO of Arena Analytics, a company based in Baltimore that applies AI to the healthcare job market. “The kind of work that other companies like us in Baltimore do are heavily reliant on the kinds of innovation that comes out of universities like Hopkins, and the relationship between Hopkins and the federal government.” Write to Liz Essley Whyte at liz.whyte@wsj.com and Nidhi Subbaraman at nidhi.subbaraman@wsj.com 

The cuts, which are in addition to threatened trims to National Institutes of Health grants, are related to the university's work with the U.S. Agency for International Development. The school is preparing to shrink its Baltimore-based affiliated nonprofit, JHPIEGO, that since the 1970s has worked closely with the USAID and has already stopped work on a number of international health projects.

The economy in Baltimore city, where the university anchors the innovation sector and is the area's largest private employer, is likely to see more ripple effects as a result, according to local groups.

It is a preview of what university administrators across the country expect at their campuses if the Trump administration prevails in court challenges and continues to target institutions of higher education through cuts to federal grants. The administration already canceled $400 million in grants and contracts to Columbia University last week over the university's handling of pro-Palestinian demonstrations, part of a series of recent moves aimed at institutions.

“Johns Hopkins has bet very heavily on a century and a quarter of partnership with the federal government,” said Dr. Theodore Iwashyna, a critical-care physician at Johns Hopkins who is currently overseeing an NIH grant to study how best to send pneumonia patients home so they don't end up re-hospitalized. “If the federal government decides it doesn't want to know things anymore, that would be bad for Johns Hopkins and devastating for Maryland.”

The White House didn't respond to requests for comment. Johns Hopkins's work received scrutiny from Department of Government Efficiency leader Elon Musk on his X platform last month, when he remarked on the closure of a transgender health clinic in India that the school helped run. “That's what American tax dollars were funding,” he wrote.

Universities are already challenging some of the Trump administration's cuts to institutions. In February, 13 schools including Johns Hopkins sued health agencies over a plan to severely cut how NIH support dollars for research, known as “indirect costs,” are awarded. The university stands to lose another $200 million if the cuts go through, a university administrator estimated in court filings. The NIH cuts are on pause while the legal challenge, from various universities, medical centers, and multiple state attorneys general, plays out.

Johns Hopkins was founded in 1876 “to foster independent and original research” and now spends more than $3 billion annually on that effort—more than any other U.S. school, according to data from the National Science Foundation. Scientists at the school invented cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR, confirmed the authenticity of the Dead Sea Scrolls, introduced the rubber glove to surgery and landed the first spacecraft on an asteroid. Twenty-nine people with links to the institution have won Nobel Prizes.

Now the sprawling institution is among big U.S. research centers bracing for wide-ranging changes.

Nearly half of the school's incoming funds last year were from research done on behalf of the federal government, said Johns Hopkins President Ronald Daniels said in a March 4 letter.

“The breadth and depth of this historic relationship means that cuts to federal research will affect research faculty, students, and staff and will ripple through our university,” he wrote.

The nonprofit JHPIEGO worked to improve health in more than 20 countries in Africa, nine countries in Asia and Ecuador and Guatemala.

A long list of Johns Hopkins' USAID-funded projects have already been halted, including a nearly complete eight-year effort with half a billion dollars in funding to convince people in more than 50 countries to adopt behaviors such as sleeping under mosquito nets in Mozambique, breast-feeding in Baltimore and using contraception in Nigeria.

Another project halted: An effort to provide chlorine tablets and soapy water and messages about good hygiene to help prevent diarrhea deaths in Bangladesh.

“A lot of what has been broken in the last six to eight weeks is not repairable,” said Dr. Judd Walson, who chairs the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health's department of international health, which oversaw the Bangladesh hygiene project. “It's going to look very very different structurally, and it's going to look very different in terms of our financial model.”

The local impact would reach far and wide: In 2022, Johns Hopkins affiliates accounted for over 93,600 jobs and over $15 billion in economic output in Maryland, according to the figures in the institution's latest economic impact report.

Cuts to research “would be devastating for the commercial ecosystem and the innovation ecosystem in Baltimore,” said Mike Rosenbaum, a university trustee and founder and CEO of Arena Analytics, a company based in Baltimore that applies AI to the healthcare job market.

“The kind of work that other companies like us in Baltimore do are heavily reliant on the kinds of innovation that comes out of universities like Hopkins, and the relationship between Hopkins and the federal government.”

The American Dad! star thanked Irish people in the TikTok video, expressing her gratitude to them. Rosie also revealed that one of the main reason behind her move is that her grandparents have been the residents of Ireland and she is expected to complete the citizenship process. She went on to say that she will consider coming back to the US when it will be safe for all citizens to have equal rights.

“You know, I'm happy. Clay is happy. I miss my other kids. I miss my friends. I miss many things about life there at home and I'm trying to find a home here in this beautiful country and when it is safe for all citizens to have equal rights there in America, that's when we will consider coming back.”

Rosie reportedly voiced her displeasure with the developments that occurred in the US this year following Donald Trump's election triumph in 2024. She claimed that she is unable to observe what is “happening politically.”

The European Union on Wednesday announced retaliatory tariffs on imports from the US after Donald Trump's proposed 25 per cent tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports went into effect.

The EU slapped duties on industrial and agricultural products, with those measures going into effect on April 1.

The EU measures will cover goods from the United States worth some 26 billion euros ($28 billion) These imports include steel and aluminum products, along with textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods.

As the US are applying tariffs worth 28 billion dollars, we are responding with countermeasures worth 26 billion euros),” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement, the Associated Press reported.

The commission manages trade and commercial conflicts on behalf of the 27 member countries.

“We will always remain open to negotiation. We firmly believe that in a world fraught with geopolitical and economic uncertainties, it is not in our common interest to burden our economies with tariffs,” von der Leyen said.

The commission also said that steel and aluminum products would be hit in return, but also textiles, leather goods, home appliances, household tools, plastics and wood. Agricultural products will also be impacted — including poultry, beef, some seafood, nuts, eggs, sugar and vegetables.

The world's biggest trading bloc was expecting the US tariffs and prepared in advance, but the measures still place great strain on already tense transatlantic relations. Only last month, Washington warned Europe that it would have to take care of its security in the future.

While US President Donald Trump said his taxes would help create factory jobs in his own country, Ursula von der Leyen said jobs were at stake and the prices would go up, both in Europe and in the United States.”

“We deeply regret this measure. Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business, and even worse for consumers. These tariffs are disrupting supply chains. They bring uncertainty for the economy,” she said.

Trump slapped similar tariffs on EU steel and aluminum during his first term, which enraged Europe and other allies. The EU also imposed countermeasures in retaliation at the time, raising tariffs on US-made motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans, among other items.

The EU estimates that annual trade volume between both sides stands at about $1.5 trillion, representing some 30% of global trade. While the bloc has a substantial export surplus in goods, it says that is partly offset by the US surplus in the trade of services.

The commission says that trade in goods reached 851 billion euros ($878 billion) in 2023, with a trade surplus of 156 billion euros ($161 billion) for the EU. Trade in services was worth 688 billion euros ($710 billion) with a trade deficit of 104 billion euros ($107 billion) for the EU.

A video showing how the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) militants attacked the Peshawar-bound Jaffar Express train in Pakistan's Bolan and hijacked more than 450 passengers has surfaced online.

HT could not independently verify the authenticity of the video, which AFP reported was released by the militants.

Pakistani security forces have rescued 190 hostages held by the gunmen and have killed 30 attackers, AFP reported, citing security sources. Officials said that rescue operations were complicated as suicide bombers wearing explosive-laden vests were positioned near the hostages.

BLA militants blew up a railway track and opened fire on the train on Tuesday. After coming under fire, the militants took control of the train after exchanging fire with security personnel. The driver was wounded in the firing.

The video shows a similar sequence of events. The train can be seen hit by an explosion and coming to a halt as armed militants positioned in the surrounding mountains aim the express. Moments later, passengers are seen getting paraded by the militants who take them under their custody.

Full-scale operation launchedPakistan security forces have launched a “full-scale” operation to rescue the remaining hostages despite threats from the BLA to assassinate them if the government takes any such measures. A security official said that the operation continues to eliminate the remaining militants. “Information suggests that some militants have fled, taking an unknown number of hostages into the local mountainous areas,” he said.

The Pakistan Army on Wednesday said that the hijack of the Jaffar Express had ended, with 21 passengers and four paramilitary Frontier Corps soldiers killed by Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) militants who had taken control of the train. 

Army spokesperson Lieutenant General Ahmad Sharif told Pakistani media outlet Dunya News TV that all 33 militants present at the attack site had been killed. 

""The armed forces successfully concluded the operation in the (Wednesday) evening by killing all terrorists and rescuing all passengers safely,” Sharif said.

""346 hostages were freed and over 30 terrorists were killed during the operation,"" an army official told AFP, adding that 27 off-duty soldiers who were passengers on the train were killed by militants, and one soldier killed during the operation,"" the official said.

Pakistan prime minister Shehbaz Sharif posted on X,""Spoke with Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti who briefed me on the latest developments in the heinous terrorist attack on Jaffar Express. The entire nation is deeply shocked by this dastardly act and saddened by the loss of innocent lives—such cowardly acts will not shake Pakistan's resolve for peace.""

“I offer my heartfelt condolences to the families of the martyrs. May Allah grant them the highest ranks in Jannah and bless those injured with a swift recovery. Dozens of the terrorists have been sent to hell,” Sharif added.

This is the first time the BLA or any insurgent group in the Balochistan province have resorted to hijacking a passenger train, although since last year, they have stepped up their attacks on security forces, installations and foreigners in different parts of the province.

In the past, the railway tracks in this area have been attacked by Baloch militants using rockets or remote-controlled bombs, and the BLA claimed responsibility for most of the attacks.

A teacher quit after he admitted to “unintentionally” watching X-rated videos inside the classroom with his laptop connected to a projector. According to Dailymail, the 14 and 13 years olds attending his physics lesson could see the porn in full view, while the teacher from Russia remained unaware of it being played on the display.

According to Dailymail, the incident took place at a school in Tashkinovo village, near the Russian city of Neftekamsk. Razif Nurgaliev was setting up for his co-ed class and had forgotten that his laptop was connected to the class projector. A video of the incident also made its way to social media after a student secretly recorded the teacher watching porn.

According to the Sun, the school initially denied that the teacher watched porn in class. Instead, they tried blaming the teen students for playing a prank on the veteran teacher, who has been in this profession for nearly 40 years. Even the school's headteacher, Rudania Burkhanova, who saw the student's video, described Nurgaliev's reaction as being shocked.

Reportedly, prior to this incident, he had an ""exemplary"" record as an educator. The school added that he is “valued and respected at the school”, emphasizing that him watching an adult video was “accidental”.

However, the incident soon sparked fury among parents who wanted Nurgaliev removed. Amid the controversy, the 62-year-old quit with immediate effect. However, the school had reportedly wanted him to stay and continue teaching.

Following the outrage, Nurgaliev admitted to watching adult content but claimed it was unintentional. He continued that he played the video unknowingly. “I clicked on something, and some website opened,” the teacher said.

NASA's chief scientist Katherine Calvin is among the 23 people laid off from the US space agency as part of President Donald Trump's administrative actions.

More job cuts are expected to happen, news agency AFP reported, citing a NASA spokesperson.

The NASA layoffs may signal a shift away from research and toward exploration since both Trump and SpaceX founder Elon Musk support a human mission to Mars, with Trump declaring in his State of the Union address last week that the US would “plant the American flag on the planet Mars and even far beyond"".

Calvin is also a renowned climatologist who has contributed to key UN climate reports.

However, she as well as other US delegates were barred from attending a major climate science meeting in China last month, as part of the Trump administration's actions to undermining climate change research, according to the report.

This is because NASA plays a crucial role in climate research, since it operates a fleet of Earth-monitoring satellites, conducts airborne and ground-based studies, develops sophisticated climate models, and provides open-source data to researchers and the public.

Trump, meanwhile, had called climate change a ""scam,"" expressing disdain for the UN and climate science. He also has pulled the US out of the Paris Agreement for a second time.

Apart from the layoffs, NASA's Office of Technology, Policy, and Strategy and the Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility Branch of the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion got eliminated altogether.

“A small number of individuals received notification March 10 they are a part of NASA's RIF,” the report quoted NASA spokeswoman Cheryl Warner as saying. ""If they're eligible, those employees may opt to participate in the Voluntary Early Retirement Authority, or VERA, or complete the RIF process.""

The NASA job cuts were so far, avoided due to last minute intervention by Jared Isaacman, Trump's nominee for NASA chief who is also an e-payments billionaire and SpaceX customer.

He is also seen as being close to Elon Musk who heads the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) which is responsible for federal cost-cutting.

The cuts were actually supposed to happen in February, including those for a thousand probationary employees, but Isaacman had asked for it to be put on hold, according to the report.

A spectacular and rare celestial event is set to take place on March 14, 2025, as a total lunar eclipse will grace the skies across the entire Western Hemisphere, including the United States. 

The eclipse occurs as the Earth moves directly between the sun and the moon in the early morning hours of March 13 and 14, 2025. Unlike previous eclipses, this one will be visible in some form from every state in the US, all of North and South America, and parts of Europe and Africa, as reported by MSN. 

Also read: March Lunar Eclipse: Why do experts advise against manifesting during eclipse season?

For the first time in years, every US state will have the opportunity to witness at least part of the total lunar eclipse. While Hawaii and parts of Alaska will enjoy the spectacle, they will miss the start of the first penumbral phase of the eclipse.

Up to 39% of the world's population will be able to see at least a portion of the penumbral phase, with approximately 863 million people—10.5% of the global population—having a front-row view of the entire event, from beginning to end.

The total lunar eclipse will span six hours and three minutes, with the peak of the event—known as totality—occurring at 2:26 am EDT on March 14, 2025. It is at this moment that the moon will take on its iconic crimson hue, giving rise to the ""blood moon"" effect.

The best times to observe the eclipse in the United States vary by time zone:

Eastern Time (ET): 2:26-3:32 am EDT on Friday

Central Time (CT): 1:26-2:32 am CDT on Friday

Mountain Time (MT): 12:26-1:32 am MDT on Friday

Pacific Time (PT): 11:26 pm on Thursday, into 12:32 am PDT on Friday,

Alaska Time (AKDT): 10:26-11:32 pm AKDT on Thursday

Hawaii-Aleutian Time (HST): 8:26-9:32 pm HST on Thursday

For those in the US who want to catch the earliest stages of the eclipse, the penumbral phase—the moment when the moon enters Earth's outer shadow—will begin around 11:57 pm EDT on 13 March, according to NASA.

A total lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes through Earth's shadow, with the Earth, sun, and moon perfectly aligned. Unlike partial lunar eclipses, where only part of the moon is obscured by Earth's shadow, a total lunar eclipse sees the entire moon move into the umbra, the darkest part of Earth's shadow, completely blocking sunlight.

As the Earth's shadow casts a deep red or reddish-orange hue over the moon, it earns the nickname ""blood moon."" This mesmerizing phenomenon happens when the Earth positions itself directly between the sun and the moon, casting a shadow that gives the moon its unique color.

Amidst Donald Trump's promise to seize control of Greenland, the centre-right opposition party of the semi-autonomous state has emerged victorious in the nation's general election.

Greenland, the biggest island in the world, is a Danish dependent region that is autonomous and has its own parliament and self-government.

The Demokraatit party received 29.9% of the vote, overthrowing the ruling coalition's majority, according to official data.

In response to Trump's statements, the party has argued that Greenlanders should make decisions about the territory's future.

During Tuesday's election, Greenlanders got an opportunity to respond to Trump, who has been vocal about his intention to seize control of Greenland. Addressing a joint session of Congress last week, Trump said that he believed the United States will win “one way or the other.”

Greenlanders could, Trump said, become “a part of the greatest nation anywhere in the world”. In a Truth Social post, he stated that he was prepared to invest billions “and make you rich”.

Speaking to Sky New, Demokraatit leader Jens-Friederik Nielsen declared that the outcome of the election should make it abundantly evident to Trump that “Greenland is not for sale.”

“We don't want to be Americans. No, we don't want to be Danes. We want to be Greenlanders. And we want our own independence in the future. And we want to build our own country by ourselves, not with his hope,” he said.

Nielsen has been poised to have a significant impact on Greenland's future. He has been a vocal opponent of foreign meddling, especially after Trump proposed that the US buy the Arctic island.

Support for the pro-business party, which advocates for a gradual separation from Denmark, increased significantly from 9.1% in the last election. It did better than the opposition party Naleraq, which called for an immediate exit from Denmark.

Nielsen claimed that Trump's remarks are “a threat to our political independence”. His reaction came in response to are cent bill prohibiting foreign donations to political parties.

According to the Danish daily Berlingske, Nielsen and Denmark's Liberal Alliance inked a political cooperation agreement in January. “We are in the midst of an exciting and crucial time in the relationship between Greenland and Denmark”, it reported.

He will now engage in discussions with other parties in a bid to create a ruling coalition.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Mute Egede, who belongs to Inuit Ataqatigiit party, said in a Facebook post: “We respect the election outcome,” adding that he would consider any suggestions made during future coalition negotiations.

According to Danish network DR, Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen extended best wishes to the Demokraatit party and stated that the next Greenlandic administration would probably have to “deal with massive pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump.”

“It's not the case that you can just take part of the Danish Realm — the future of Greenland is based on what the Greenlandic people and government want,” Poulsen wrote.

Taking to X, American political blogger Seth Abramson wrote: “Trump and Musk lost the election in Greenland as hard as you can lose an election in a country you have virtually nothing to do with and never will.”

With only 57,000 residents, the enormous island has become embroiled in a geopolitical struggle for supremacy in the Arctic, where the melting ice caps are paving up new shipping lanes and increasing access to its resources. China and Russia have both increased their military presence in the area.

A new surveillance camera shot showed missing University of Pittsburgh student Sudiksha Konanki cuddling up to a man before she disappeared. Konanki, 20, an Indian-origin woman, vanished while on a spring break holiday in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. She was last seen at the Riu Republica Resort beach on March 6 around 4:50 am.

According to Noticias SIN, the image is the last known photo of Konanki. The picture shows her walking down a path at the Riu Republic Resort with friends. The photo emerged after local authorities announced that the FBI was joining the search for the missing student.

Konanki and the unidentified man had their arms around each other's backs as they walked down the road with a group of friends. It is unclear what time the photo was captured. However, according to authorities, the group was partying at a disco around 3 am before later heading to the beach. Konanki was seen swimming with a “young man” before she disappeared.

A 24-year-old tourist from Iowa was the last person to see Konanki alive. Joshua Stevem Ribe, a fellow guest at the Caribbean resort from tiny Rock Rapids, suggested that he passed out drunk on the beach, and when he woke up, Konanki was missing. Ribe gave three versions to cops of the incidents leading up to Konanki's disappearance. He is now cooperating with authorities, who have not said if they suspect foul play.

Officials have said that the investigation is now being led by a “high-level commission” of local and US agencies, as reported by the New York Post. “As part of international cooperating protocols, the FBI and the US Embassy Liaison have increased their involvement, in accordance with established memorandums of understanding,” the Dominican Republic National Police said in a statement.

The statement added, “The investigation confirms that the disappearance occurred after 4:15 a.m. on March 6, 2025, at which time the missing woman and her foreign companions were captured on surveillance cameras just meters away from entering the beach area.”

Dominican President Luis Abinader said Ribe's accounts have been worrying authorities. “We are concerned,” he said Monday, March 10, during his weekly meeting with the press. “All government agencies are searching … because the latest information we have from one of them, from the last person who was with the young woman, what he says according to the reports is that a wave, while on the beach, crashed into them.”

The Virginia track runner accused of hitting her opponent with a baton during a 4x200 metre relay race yelled at the younger athlete, according to a lip reader. Alaila Everett, a senior at I.C. Norcom High School, recently sparked outrage for allegedly attacking Kaelen Tucker, a Brookville High School junior, during the VHSL Class 3 State Indoor Championships at Liberty University on March 7. 

LipReader founder Nicola Hickling told Daily Mail that Everett yelled “get off” and “hey oh” as she struck Tucker's head with the baton. At the time of the alleged attack, the two athletes were racing to secure the second place. However, when the junior runner attempted to get in front of the senior, they rubbed elbows while cutting into lane one. 

Footage of the incident quickly went viral on social media, with netizens criticising Everett for striking her opponent in the head. In a medical examination after the relay race, Tucker was diagnosed with concussion and a “possible skull fracture,” New York Post reported. 

Reflecting on the attack, the victim told WSET ABC 13, “As we were coming up in the middle of the curve, we were bumping arms a lot. So, I got a little more on the outside of the curve to go around her.” “When I finally pushed through to get in front of her, that's when she hit me in the head with the baton,” Tucker added.

However, Everett denied the allegations, claiming that she lost her balance, causing her to accidentally hit Tucker. “I know my intentions, and I would never hit someone on purpose,” she said in a tearful interview with WAVY.com. “My baton got stuck behind her back … and it rolled up her back. I lost my balance when I pumped my arms again. She got hit,” the senior claimed.

While the I.C. Norcom High School team was disqualified from the championship, Tucker's parents sought an apology from Everett and served her family court papers for a protective order against their daughter. The high school junior's mother expressed fury over the incident. “My child was hurt and nobody came to check on her,” Tamarrow told WSET ABC 13.

Michelle Obama jokingly chastised her husband, Barack Obama, on her new podcast with her elder brother, Craig Robinson.

Higher Ground, the media group founder by former President Obama and his wife, on Monday, launched “IMO with Michelle Obama & Craig Robinson”. Wednesday saw the release of the first two episodes, which included an introduction and an interview with actress Issa Rae.

In her first episode, Michelle, 61, complained that Barack Obama, 63, had a terrible habit of arriving late.

“I got this husband who's like, when it's time to leave, it's three o'clock, he's getting up and going to the bathroom!” the author of Becoming stated, as per Newsweek. “And I was like, 'Dude, dude, like three o'clock departure means you've done all that,' you know? It's like, don't start looking for your glasses, you know, at the three o'clock departure.”

She further noted that Obama has “improved” over 30 years of their marriage.

The mother of two, who is parent to Malia and Sasha, said she taught her girls to be on time.

“If they're doing anything with me, they are early, so they've learned how to snap to it.”

The former First Lady has hosted Michelle Obama Podcast before. According to her website bio, it “was the most successful original in Spotify history, bringing in more women listeners over 40 than any other podcast” when it was first released in 2020.

Taking to Instagram, Michelle shared her reasons for wanting to launch a podcast in 2025.

Stressing that a lot is happening in the world at the moment, she told her 56.8 million followers, “We're living through some really complicated and confusing times, and on top of that, folks are trying to juggle family life, work dynamics, relationships, aging parents, and more.”

She hailed Craig as one of the individuals who never fails to provide her with the comedy, knowledge, and insights that she needs to get through any situation. “Together, we'll share our perspectives about some of your questions. And we won't be doing it alone. We'll be joined by special guests, friends, and experts along the way.”

She further ensured that she will tell truth and discuss a wide range of perspectives. “A lot of learning. And plenty of laughs. We all need some moments of light right now.”

New episodes of IMO featuring Michelle Obama and Craig Robinson will be made accessible every week on Spotify, YouTube and Apple Podcasts.

US President Donald Trump's decision to impose tariffs and suggestions that Canada should be annexed have angered Canadians, who are expressing their anger in different ways. New travel bookings to the neighbouring country have declined by 20% since February 1.

United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said that the carrier has adjusted its capacity after seeing a big drop in passenger arrivals from Canada.

Allyson C, a Vancouver resident who cancelled her family's summer vacation to Washington, said the family has lost a lot of interest in going to the States in general. He cited the frequent tariff disputes with the Trump administration and fluctuations in the US exchange rate as reasons, reported Reuters.

The US Travel Association estimated that a 10% drop in Canadian travellers could cost $2.1 billion in consumer spending in the US. The States recorded 20.4 million visits in 2024. Arrivals were already at 90% of pre-pandemic levels and a drop further worries the local travel industry.

Jan Freitag, director of U.S. hospitality at CoStar, said the language of the Trump administration, the weather and the exchange rate will affect cross-border travel in 2024. “The thing that is different this year is the rhetoric from the administration that has a lot of Canadians thinking twice about coming across the border,” he said.

The actions and words of the Trump administration have also affected Canada's attitude towards the US. Corey Fram, director of a tourism marketing firm said the US president's “continuous disparagement of Canada is taking a toll.”

The firm also had to adjust its messaging about US destinations to the Canadian audience. “We've been very careful not to broadcast and demonstrate U.S. assets to Canadian audiences and Canadian assets to U.S. audiences because when we have, we found that has drawn out a lot of negative sentiment,” Fram said.

Travelers from Canada aren't the only ones avoiding the US Bookings from Denmark and Germany, which dropped by 27% and 15% compared to last year, according to Forward Keys. However, overall demand from Europe only fell by 1%. The Trump administration has announced that from April 11, all foreign visitors over age 14 must register and provide fingerprints if they stay in the US for more than 30 days. Canadians are not exempt, even though they are usually allowed to visit for up to six months without a visa.

A private eye who worked for slain Natalee Holloway's family has reportedly offered to help in the case of University of Pittsburgh student Sudiksha Konanki, a 20-year-old Indian-origin woman who vanished while on a spring break holiday in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. She was last spotted at the Riu Republica Resort beach on March 6 around 4:50 am.

TJ Ward, who helped Holloway's parents when she went missing in Aruba 20 years ago, has “made contact with the [Konanki] family” to “try to help them locate their daughter” in the Dominican Republic, he told NewsNation. Ward does not think Konanki drowned, and agrees with the missing student's family that something more sinister has happened.

“I don't think that she drowned in the ocean,” Ward told Fox News, noting that “drowning would be one of the last things I think of right now.”

“I totally believe that somebody knows something, where she is, or somebody took her away, or somebody's holding her somewhere,” he added.

While authorities suggested Konanki may have drowned, her family believes she may have been kidnapped. Echoing what Konanki's father previously said, Ward stated, “If she had gone into the water [and drowned], she would've washed up somewhere with a tide the way that comes into the island.”

Konanki and Holloway's case have some similarities, including the fact that both of them travelled to a Caribbean beach resort with classmates. Both women disappeared on the beach at night after staying out late with pals. Last year, the prime suspect in Holloway's disappearance, Joran van der Sloot, appeared in an Alabama court, where prosecutors said he confessed that he killed Holloway for refusing his sexual advances.

Ward said that while youngsters are attracted to vacations on Caribbean islands, they “don't understand travel in these other countries.” “There's problems there with assaults, kidnappings and so on and so forth,” he added.

“There's bad people out in the middle of the night, and I don't know why she was out at 4:30 in the morning, or where her friends were, but you can't be by yourself like that, walking in a country that you know nothing about,” Ward said. “You need to stay in groups and where you're not going to be a target.”

Last year, a woman named Jada Bell claiming to be the cousin of former NFL running back Le'Veon Bell accused him of having nonconsensual incestual relations with her from a young age. According to the civil lawsuit she filed in Franklin County, Ohio, Bell's allegedly started subjecting her to sexual abuse when she was just six years old, continuing “ through at least 2017.” Jada alleged that his misconduct only came to an end once she turned 18.

Le'Veon Bell has now denied claims of the years-long assault and sexual abuse. His vehement denial comes after an Ohio jury awarded her a $25 million verdict ($20m in compensatory damages + $5m in punitive damages), per The New York Post. The Jets star's brother, La'Vonte, was also found to owe the woman more than $11 million in damages at the Feb 26 hearing.

As per the documents obtained by The Post, the lawsuit alleges that the former NFL athlete, who is eight years older than the alleged victim would engage in sexual encounters “throughout the plaintiff's minority, including during his frequent returns to Central Ohio during his college years and beyond, and that Le'Veon Bell had used “slang terms” to direct the woman on which acts he wanted her to perform, citing one such instance where he “termed oral sex ‘fire.'”

Bell played for the Pittsburgh Steelers before joining the New York Jets in free agency in 2019. He also played for the Kansas City Chiefs, Baltimore Ravens and Tampa Bay Buccaneers before nine-year NFL career came to an end. Bell has remained an avid Donald Trump supporter for a while now. He even made an appearance at a campaign event in October. Throwing support behind the MAGA leader, he proclaimed, “""Let's vote for Trump! Let's make some noise for the president!""

Once his alleged victim was awarded the $25 million verdict, he took to his social media, insinuating that he was being targeted for being a Trump supporter. “Being a black man and a trump supporter at the same time, so many ppl wanna attack me .. lol like why tho??? I just don't get it .. it don't matter tho, we STILL GOIN UP,” he wrote online.

Bell's attorney Thomas W Shaffer has since issued a statement via TMZ: “My client adamantly denies any and all allegations that have been lodged against him. Further, he was never served with a civil complaint or any documents.”

He added, “The default judgment granted was based upon violations of his Fifth Amendment rights of due process for failing to be served. My client is in the process of filing a motion to open and reverse the default judgment because the narratives of the case have never been litigated.”

The hometown sheriff's department of Sudiksha Konanki, a University of Pittsburgh student who went missing while on a spring break holiday in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, has named a person of interest in her disappearance. Loudoun County, Virginia Sheriff's Office spokesperson Thomas Julia told Fox News Digital that 24-year-old Joshua Ribe is a “person of interest” in Konanki's disappearance.

Julia said that Riibe “has been interviewed at length,” but added it's “still a missing person case, not a criminal case.” Ribe has not been accused of any crime at this time.

“Sheriff [Michael] Chapman wants to make sure the investigation is comprehensive and includes all possible assets and techniques,” Julia said. “We are working closely with the FBI on all of this, and they are working with the Dominican National Police.”

Ribe, a tourist from Iowa, was reportedly the last person to see Konanki alive. Konanki was last spotted at the Riu Republica Resort beach on March 6 around 4:50 am.

A fellow guest at the Caribbean resort from tiny Rock Rapids, Ribe gave three versions to the police of what led to Konanki's disappearance. He suggested that he passed out drunk on the beach, and when he woke up, Konanki had vanished.

Ribe first told police that he threw up from the rough surf and went back to shore, but also asked Konanki if she was ok. He said in the second version that he felt sick to his stomach and left the water, and last saw Konanki in knee-deep water in the surf before he passed out. In the final version, he said he saw Konanki walking along the shore before he fell asleep.

Ribe is cooperating with authorities, police said. Dominican President Luis Abinader said Ribe's accounts have been worrying authorities. “We are concerned,” he said Monday, March 10, during his weekly meeting with the press. “All government agencies are searching … because the latest information we have from one of them, from the last person who was with the young woman, what he says according to the reports is that a wave, while on the beach, crashed into them.”

Meanwhile, Sheriff Mike Chapman of Konanki's hometown in Loudoun County, Virginia, told NewsNation on Monday, March 10, it is “way too premature” to assume the missing student drowned. “There was some speculation that she may have drowned. I think it's way too premature to make an assumption like that,” Chapman said.

Of Ribe's varying statements, Chapman said, “We're trying to get some consistency with the statements here … if you give inconsistent statements, that means you're not telling the truth. What we gotta do is get the facts here.”

At the time Konanki disappeared, she was likely on the beach because of a power outage at her Dominican Republic resort. The outage may have disabled some security systems and cameras, as per reports. Dominican Today reported that the power at Riu República Hotel went out in the early hours of March 6. Each area being off-limits at night, it would often be left unsupervised. The power outage disrupted lighting, security systems and surveillance cameras.

Comedian Bill Burr slammed Elon Musk as an “idiot,” and called him an “evident Nazi.” The 56-year-old made the comments during his appearance on the latest episode of NPR's Fresh Air podcast, where he promoted his new Hulu comedy special, Drop Dead Years. Burr said his latest stand-up material is aimed at waking people up to the realities of the present political atmosphere.

“I'm trying to get regular people to stop yelling at each other and realize that it's a select few group of nerds eating raw almonds and doing their stupid workouts and competing with each other to have the biggest infinity pool, and the rest of us are getting pushed down,” Burr said. “They've politicized the whole stupid thing and we're falling for it.”

On being asked to clarify what nerds he was referencing, Burr replied, “That idiot Elon Musk, who evidently is a Nazi.”

“I just refuse to believe it was an accidental two-time Sieg Heil [by Musk], and he does it at a presidential inauguration!” Burr added, referring to the SpaceX CEO's controversial hand gesture at an Inauguration Day event, which many thought looked like a Nazi salute.

“This is why I hate liberals,” Burr said. “Liberals have no teeth whatsoever. They just go, ‘Oh my God, can you believe this? I'm getting out of the country!'”

He added, “I'm just like, you're gonna leave the country because of one guy with dyed hair plugs and a laminated face? Who makes a bad car and has an obsolete social media platform? Why doesn't he leave? Why are we so afraid of this guy who can't fight his way out of a wet paper bag?”

Musk became an integral part of Donald Trump's administration since the latter was re-elected. The tech tycoon has been making headlines ever since, and is very often seen around Trump.

Earlier this year, comedian and TV host Chelsea Handler said during a panel at the SXSW film festival, “Did anyone vote for Elon Musk to be the president? I mean, can't we come together — Republicans and Democrats — and say we don't want that? Can't we agree on that at least?”

Hostages freed from a train siege in southwestern Pakistan on Tuesday said they walked for hours through mountainous terrain to reach safety, forced to leave behind relatives from whom they were separated.

Rebels waging a war of independence against the Pakistani state set off explosions on the railway track in a remote area of Balochistan, forcing the train to a halt and taking more than 450 passengers hostage.

""I can't find the words to describe how we managed to escape. It was terrifying,"" Muhammad Bilal told AFP.

Bilal had been traveling with his mother on the Jafar Express train when it was caught in the explosive crossfire, leaving at least three dead, according to a railway official.

More than 100 hostages have been freed from the train, which remains held up by rebel forces.

""I heard an explosion followed by gunfire as rebels boarded the train,"" passenger Allahditta told AFP at the train station in Mach, where the waiting area has been transformed into a makeshift hospital to treat the wounded. 

""People began hiding under the seats in panic. They separated the men from the women. They allowed me and my family to go because I told them I'm a heart patient,"" the 49-year-old said.

""We walked for a long time through the mountains to reach the nearest station. I haven't eaten since I began fasting this morning, but I still can't bring myself to eat,"" Allahditta added, in reference to the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

One passenger described gunmen sorting through identity cards to confirm who was from outside of the province, similar to a spate of recent attacks carried out by the Baloch Liberation Army, which has claimed credit for the seige. 

""They came and checked IDs and service cards and shot two soldiers in front of me and took the other four to, I don't know where,"" said one passenger who asked not to be named, after walking four hours to the nearest train station.

""They checked IDs and those who were Punjabis were taken away by the terrorists,"" he added. 

The BLA claim the region's natural resources are being exploited by outsiders and has increased attacks targeting Pakistanis from other regions.

Late on Tuesday, survivors walked through rugged terrain to the nearest train station and travelled to Mach, about 200 kilometres (124 miles) from the Iran border. 

The first trains carrying survivors arrived late on Tuesday evening to be met by paramilitary forces and doctors. 

""I am treating two (police) officers, one was shot five times, while the other was wounded in his knee,"" said paramedic Qazim Farooq.

The video shows Sudiksha Konanki wearing a white t-shirt and shorts.

Sudiksha Konanki, the Indian student who went missing from the Dominican Republic, was last seen walking with friends hours before she mysteriously vanished from a beach on the Caribbean island.

Newly released surveillance footage, first reported by Dominican news outlet Noticias SIN, captures the 20-year-old University of Pittsburgh student's final moments before her disappearance. The timestamp on the video reads ""Thursday 5:16,"" - the day she disappeared. It remains unclear whether it refers to the morning or evening.

In the clip, Ms Konanki is seen walking with an unidentified man, their arms around each other's backs, as they stroll along a resort pathway at the Riu Republica Resort in Punta Cana, accompanied by other friends. The video shows the student wearing a white t-shirt and shorts and her hair tied in a ponytail. 



Ms Konanki travelled to the Dominican Republic with five friends for a vacation. On Thursday, the night of her disappearance, the group partied at a resort disco until 3 am before heading to the beach an hour later. By 5:50 am, most of her friends had left, leaving her alone with Joshua Steven Ribe, a 24-year-old tourist from Iowa, who is believed to be the last person to see her.

Mr Ribe, now a key witness, has changed his statement thrice. In one account, he claimed he vomited from rough waves, left the water, and checked if Ms Konanki was okay. In another, he said he felt sick, exited the surf, and last saw her in knee-deep water before passing out. In a third version, he said he saw her walking along the shore before falling asleep.

By the time Mr Ribe woke up, Ms Konanki had vanished. Local reports suggest she was last seen swimming in the ocean wearing a brown bikini, with her clothes left on a beachside chaise lounge. 

As the search for the 20-year-old enters its sixth day, authorities suspect she may have drowned, but her family suspects she was kidnapped.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Telecom operator Bharti Airtel on Tuesday said it has signed an agreement with billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX to bring Starlink's satellite internet service to India. The announcement was made nearly a month after Musk met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington and discussed strengthening collaboration in space, mobility, technology and innovation.

""Airtel and SpaceX will explore offering Starlink equipment in Airtel's retail stores, Starlink services via Airtel to business customers, opportunities to connect communities, schools, and health centers, among many others, in even the most rural parts of India,"" the company said in a statement.

SpaceX's chief operating officer, Gwynne Shotwell, said the company was ""excited"" to work with Airtel"" and unlock the ""transformative impact"" Starlink can bring to the people of India.

The announcement also follows Musk's signing a deal for the first Tesla showroom in India to sell imported electric cars.

The collaboration between Airtel and Starlink - which has been trying to push into the Indian market since 2021 - will help the two companies bring high-speed broadband to the most remote parts of India, which is one of the world's biggest telecom markets and has nearly 100 crore users.

Many remote regions in the country lack reliable internet due to the high cost and logistical challenges of laying fiber-optic cables or building mobile towers.

Starlink's satellite-based system, however, could help bridge the gap and offer high-speed internet, about 25-220 Mbps, to these areas.

Currently, out of 6,44,131 villages in the country, 6,15,836 have 4G mobile connectivity.

Elon Musk's Starlink has so far not announced pricing in India, where Internet data prices are currently among the cheapest in the world. However, in 2022, the then Starlink India Country Director, Sanjay Bhargava, said it could cost Rs 1,58,000 for the first year.

From the second year, it could cost Rs 1,15,000, Mr Bhargava had said.



None of the Indian neighbours, except Bhutan, have access to Starlink.

In Bhutan, Starlink's 'Residential Lite Plan' costs about Rs 3,000 per month and offers speeds from 23 Mbps to 100 Mbps. The 'Standard Residential Plan' costs about Rs 4,200 per month and offers speeds from 25 Mbps to 110 Mbps.

Starlink is currently available in over 100 countries. In Kenya, it is priced at $10 per month, while at $120 in the US.

Internet connectivity in India - the world's most populous country - has risen rapidly in recent years. According to the data provided by the government, Internet connections have jumped from about 25 crore in 2014 to over 96 crore in 2024, a growth of 285.53%.

Broadband connections, on the other hand, have increased by 1,452% - from about 6 crore in 2014 to 94 crore in 2024.

Average monthly data consumption per wireless data subscriber has increased by 353 times - from 61.66 MB in 2014 to 21.30 GB in 2024.

The country has also seen the fastest rollout of 5G services in the world, with over 4.62 lakh BTS (Base Transceiver Station) deployed across 779 districts, the government data has shown.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

US President Donald Trump bought a shiny red Tesla with the company's CEO Elon Musk by his side, who helped the Republican leader pick the car on the White House driveway on Tuesday. The car was bought in a show of support for Musk's electric vehicle company, which is facing a blowback because of the Tesla CEO's work to advance the President's political agenda.

""Wow, that's beautiful,"" Trump said as he eased his way into the driver's seat of a Model X.

Musk, who got in on the passenger seat, joked about ""giving the Secret Service a heart attack"" as they talked about how to start a vehicle that can reach 95 kilometres per hour in a few seconds. However, Trump did not test drive the car since he is not permitted to drive, but said that he will leave it at the White House so his staff can drive it.

According to the US President, he bought the car - worth around $80,000 - at the full price, without any discount.

""Musk would give me a discount, but if I do a discount, they're gonna say, Oh, I got benefits,"" he said.

The US President cited two key reasons for buying Tesla - one, it's a great product, and another, ""Elon Musk has devoted his energy and his life to doing this and I think he has been treated very unfairly"".

Number one, it's a great product, as good as it gets—and number two, because @ElonMusk has devoted his energy and his life to doing this and I think he has been treated very unfairly… pic.twitter.com/6qrfwrbT0f

""When I saw what was happening, I said that I want to buy a Tesla, and we just went to the front. He (Elon Musk) had four beautiful cars there, and I bought one in front of the press. It was a very public purchase, and they're beautiful and do a great job,"" he said.

Calling Musk a ""patriot"", Trump said, ""He's done a great job...It's not that he's a Republican... Sometimes, I'm not even sure what he is in terms of his philosophy, but he's a great guy.""

The Tesla shares have been witnessing a sharp slump since Musk's role in the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Recently, anti-DOGE protesters gathered outside Tesla stores across the US to protest the automaker's billionaire CEO and his push to slash government spending on behalf of the President, with many holding banners that read ""Elon must go away"" and ""honk if Elon Musk should be fired"". A few protests even turned violent.

In the last month, the shares have dropped by over 30 per cent. While on Monday, the shares dropped by 15 per cent, it went up a day later nearly 5 per cent - making back a small fraction of what it lost amid an extended sell-off since January.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

An official at the US Agency for International Development has ordered employees to shred a large volume of records, according to a court filing on Tuesday by government employee unions asking a judge to block the move.

In a motion filed in Washington, DC, federal court, the unions cited an email from USAID's acting executive secretary Erica Carr instructing employees to come to the agency's office on Tuesday for ""clearing classified safes and personnel documents.""

""Shred as many documents first, and reserve the burn bags for when the shredder becomes unavailable or needs a break,"" Carr wrote in the email, which was included in the filing. The email did not give details about what documents were to be shredded.

The unions said the directive ""suggests a rapid destruction of agency records on a large scale"" that both violates federal record-keeping law and could destroy evidence in their case, which seeks to undo the dismantling of USAID under President Donald Trump.

White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly on X called reports of the shredding ""fake news hysteria"" and wrote that the documents were ""old, mostly courtesy content (content from other agencies), and the originals still exist on classified computer systems.""

Kelly also wrote that the USAID building would soon be occupied by US Customs and Border Protection.

The lawsuit was brought by the American Federation of Government Employees and American Foreign Service Association, which represent government employees, as well as by anti-poverty organization Oxfam America. They allege that Trump overstepped his authority in largely shuttering an independent agency established by Congress by firing or putting on leave its employees and cancelling its agreements with third-party partners.

The plaintiffs on Tuesday asked US District Judge Carl Nichols for a temporary restraining order blocking the destruction of records. They said that if they eventually prevail in the case, the loss of vital personnel or other records could prevent USAID from resuming its operations.

In response to Tuesday's motion, the judge ordered both sides to submit a status report by Wednesday morning proposing a schedule for briefs on the motion and noting any disagreements between them.

Nichols, a Trump appointee, last month allowed the administration to go forward with its plan to put more than 2,000 USAID employees on leave. Under Trump, the foreign aid agency has scrapped more than 80% of its programs and fired much of its staff.

In a separate lawsuit brought by USAID contractors and grant recipients, a federal judge on Monday ruled that the Trump administration cannot refuse to spend foreign aid money appropriated by Congress, although the judge stopped short of restoring canceled contracts. In that case, the Trump administration has repeatedly resisted complying with court orders to release frozen funds.

US President Donald Trump said Wednesday that negotiators were headed to Russia ""right now"" for talks on a possible ceasefire with Ukraine, after Kyiv agreed to a 30-day truce.

Trump did not give further details on the negotiating team.

""People are going to Russia right now as we speak. And hopefully we can get a ceasefire from Russia,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office during a meeting with Ireland's prime minister.

""And if we do, I think that would be 80 percent of the way to getting this horrible bloodbath finished.""

Vice President JD Vance, who was also in the meeting, added that there were ""conversations that are happening on the phone and in person with some of our representatives over the next couple of days.""

Trump would not say when he would next speak to his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, but added that ""I hope he's going to have a ceasefire"" and that there had been ""positive messages"" from Moscow.

""It's up to Russia now,"" said Trump.

Trump was coy about pressuring Moscow to agree to a truce, saying he could slap it with ""devastating"" sanctions but adding that ""I hope that's not going to be necessary.""

""I can do things financially that would be very bad for Russia. I don't want to do that because I want to get peace,"" Trump added.

His comments come less than two weeks after an explosive row between Trump, Vance and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office in front of television cameras.

Trump halted military aid after the argument to pressure Kyiv, which agreed to a US-proposed plan for a 30-day ceasefire at talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday.

The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) has intensified its violent campaign in Pakistan's southwest Balochistan province over the past year, posing a significant threat to the state. As the most active group fighting for independence in the mineral-rich region, the BLA has been responsible for numerous attacks targeting foreign interests, security forces, and Pakistani labourers from other regions, particularly Punjab.

The BLA's struggle for independence is deeply rooted in the region's history and economic landscape. Balochistan is rich in hydrocarbons and minerals, yet 70% of its 15 million inhabitants live below the poverty line. The BLA claims that the Pakistani military and Punjabi elite are exploiting the region's resources for their own benefit, leaving the local population impoverished and marginalised.

In a recent statement, the BLA emphasised its determination to protect the region's resources, stating, ""The valuable natural resources in Balochistan belong to the Baloch nation. Pakistani military generals and their Punjabi elite are looting these resources for their own luxury.""

The past year has seen a surge in violence, with attacks increasing by 90% compared to 2023, according to the Islamabad-based Center for Research and Security Studies. The military's heavy-handed response to the insurgency has been criticised by human rights groups, who allege widespread enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings.

The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has expressed concern over the impunity enjoyed by perpetrators and the government's indifference to the plight of the Baloch people. Rights activists regularly hold protests in the province, accusing the authorities of abuses and demanding justice for missing persons.

The group's membership is estimated to be around 5,000, with a growing number of women, including law students and medicine graduates, participating in its activities.

According to Abdul Basit, a researcher at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, the BLA has been able to tap into the frustrations of the local population, who feel that their voices are not being heard. The BLA ""has been able to exploit legitimate local grievances"", he said.

The BLA's tactics have become increasingly sophisticated, with the group using women suicide bombers and carrying out meticulously planned attacks, such as the recent train siege. The government's ability to protect foreign investment and infrastructure projects, particularly those related to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), is a major concern.

China has poured billions of dollars into Pakistan, including the deep-water port of Gwadar, the flagship project of the CPEC. The Pakistani government has repeatedly vowed to protect Chinese citizens and infrastructure projects, many of which run through Balochistan.

In response to the growing threat, Pakistan has accused Kabul of failing to root out militants sheltering on its side of the border. However, Basit believes that the real issue lies within Balochistan itself, where the BLA has been able to tap into deep-seated grievances and frustrations among the local population.

""The real fault lines are in Balochistan,"" Basit said. ","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

As Donald Trump took the oath of office on Jan. 20, he was flanked by some of the world's wealthiest people. The billionaires present that day - including Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg - had never been richer, flush with big gains from frothy stock markets.

Seven weeks later, it's a different story. The start of Trump's second term has delivered a stunning reversal for many of those billionaires sitting behind Trump in the Capitol Rotunda, with five having lost a combined $209 billion in wealth, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

The period between Trump's election and his inauguration was a boon for the world's wealthiest, with the S&P 500 Index hitting several all-time highs. Investors piled into equity and crypto markets, expecting that Trump's policies would be advantageous to business.

Musk's Tesla Inc. gained 98% in the weeks after the election, hitting a record high. Arnault's LVMH added 7% in the week before Inauguration Day, making the French magnate $12 billion richer. Even Zuckerberg's Meta Platforms Inc., which banned Trump from the social-media platform in 2021, gained 9% before the beginning of the new term and an additional 20% in his first four weeks in office.

But any expectations that the start of Trump's new term would continue to fuel market returns have been upended. The S&P 500 has lost 6.4% since he took office, as mass layoffs of government employees and the president's back-and-forth on tariffs have roiled equities, with the benchmark index tumbling 2.7% on Monday.  

The companies behind the inauguration attendees' fortunes have been some of the biggest losers, dropping a combined $1.39 trillion in market value since Jan. 17, the last trading day before the inauguration. Here's a look at some of those fortunes:

Elon Musk (down $148 billion)

The 53-year-old Tesla chief executive officer's net worth peaked at $486 billion on Dec. 17, the largest fortune ever recorded on Bloomberg's wealth index. Most of his gains came from Tesla, whose stock nearly doubled after the election. Since then, the electric carmaker has given up all of those gains. Consumers in Europe have soured on Musk's support for far-right politicians, with Tesla sales in Germany falling by more than 70% in the first two months of the year. Chinese shipments also fell by 49% last month to levels not seen since July 2022.

Jeff Bezos (down $29 billion)

Bezos, 61, who clashed with Trump over the postal service and his ownership of the Washington Post during the president's first term, congratulated Trump the day after the election on Musk's X social-media platform. Amazon donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund in December, and Bezos dined with the president last month, the same day that Bezos announced that his newspaper will prioritize personal liberties and free markets in its opinion section. Amazon shares have fallen 14% since Jan. 17.

Sergey Brin (down $22 billion)

Brin, 51, who co-founded the company then known as Google with Larry Page and still retains a 6% stake, joined a protest against the Trump administration's immigration policy at the San Francisco airport in 2017. After Trump was re-elected in November, Brin dined with him at Mar-a-Lago the following month. Alphabet Inc.'s shares tumbled more than 7% in early February after it missed quarterly revenue estimates. Representatives from Alphabet, which is currently facing pressure from the Justice Department to break up its search engine company, last week met with the government and asked it to take a less aggressive stance.

Mark Zuckerberg (down $5 billion)

Meta was the standout winner among the Magnificent Seven tech stocks at the beginning of this year. Even as the group of companies that has powered much of the S&P 500's gains over the past few years were flatlining, Meta rose 19% from mid-January to mid-February. Since then, though, the stock has lost all those gains. The Magnificent Seven index is down 20% since its mid-December high.

Bernard Arnault (down $5 billion)

Arnault, 76, whose family owns the luxury conglomerate behind brands including Louis Vuitton and Bulgari, has been a friend of Trump's for decades, speaking with the then-candidate the day after the Pennsylvania assassination attempt in July. After declining through most of 2024, LVMH jumped more than 20% from the election through late January. It's since given up most of those gains. Morningstar analysts said last month that a 10% to 20% tariff on European luxury goods could depress sales, which have already been struggling.

Passengers onboard the Jaffar Express in Pakistan's Balochistan, have spoken of ""doomsday scenes"". ""We held our breath throughout the firing, not knowing what would happen next,"" Ishaq Noor, who was on board during the hijack, told the BBC.

400 passengers were travelling from Quetta to Peshawar on Tuesday when the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) attacked the train and took some as hostages. 

Per the military, 190 passengers have been freed and 27 militants killed. The rescue operations are ongoing. However, the BLA has warned of ""severe consequences"" if any attempt is made to rescue the remaining hostages.

According to reports, security officials have said that some militants have taken a few passengers up the mountainous area.

Muhammad Ashraf who was travelling to visit family from Quetta to Lahore said, ""There was a lot of fear among the passengers. It was a scene of doomsday,"" he said. He and his wife tried to protect their child by shielding amidst gunfire. ""If a bullet comes our way, it will hit us and not the children,"" he said.

""The attackers were talking to each other in Balochi, and their leader repeatedly told them to 'keep an eye' particularly on the security personnel to make sure that [the attackers] do not lose them,"" Mushtaq Muhammad, a passenger in the train's their carriage said, and called the attack ""unforgettable"".

Starting Tuesday evening, the militants started releasing some Balochistan residents, women, children and elderly passengers.

On Wednesday, the BBC saw wooden coffins being loaded at the Quetta railway station. An official said they were being carried for possible casualties.

The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said it is ""gravely concerned"" by the train hijack.

""We strongly urge all relevant stakeholders to forge an urgent rights-based, pro-people consensus on the issues faced by citizens in Balochistan and to find a peaceful, political solution,"" it said in a statement on X. ","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Xavier Musk, the daughter of Tesla CEO Elon Musk (who changed her name to Vivian Jenna Wilson), made an unexpected revelation about her father's use of sex-selective IVF (in vitro fertilisation). Vivian Jenna Wilson has implied that her estranged father, Elon Musk, used sex-selective in vitro fertilisation (IVF) when she was conceived, alleging that Musk perceived her transness as ""going against the product that was sold.""

""My assigned sex at birth was a commodity that was bought and paid for. So when I was feminine as a child and then turned out to be transgender, I was going against the product that was sold,"" the 20-year-old wrote in a post to Threads on Monday.

""That expectation of masculinity that I had to rebel against all my life was a monetary transaction. A monetary transaction. A MONETARY TRANSACTION.""

In a follow-up post, Wilson asked, ""How the F**K is this legal?""

Page Six has reached out to Musk for comment but did not immediately hear back. Wilson came out as transgender in June 2022 when she filed a request to change her first name and take the last name of her mom, Justine Wilson.

The filing listed the reason as ""gender identity and the fact that I no longer live with or wish to be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form.""

Two years later, Musk, 53, claimed he had been deceived into allowing Vivian's medical gender reassignment.

""I was essentially tricked into signing documents for one of my older boys, Xavier,"" the Tesla CEO told psychologist Dr Jordan Peterson in a Daily Wire interview at the time, using Vivian's deadname.

""This is before I had any understanding of what was going on. COVID was going on, so there was a lot of confusion, and I was told Xavier might commit suicide if he doesn't [make the change].""

Musk said he essentially ""lost"" his child and reiterated that he had been ""tricked.""

In a significant development, Jio Platforms has announced a collaboration with Elon Musk's SpaceX to offer Starlink internet services in India. However, this partnership is contingent upon SpaceX obtaining the necessary approvals from the Indian government before commencing operations in the country.

Starlink had been trying to find a way into the Indian market since October 2022.

The journey to this collaboration has been marked by initial resistance from both Jio and Airtel, who opposed Starlink's entry into the Indian market. The two telecom giants, along with Starlink, were poised to launch satellite broadband services in India following the government's decision to allocate spectrum administratively. Jio had advocated for an auction-based approach, while the government preferred to follow global practices and allocate spectrum administratively.

During the India Mobile Congress (IMC) 2024, Sunil Mittal, the chairman of Bharti Airtel, emphasised the need for a level playing field, stating that satellite companies should be required to purchase spectrum and pay license fees, just like traditional telecom companies. Mittal's stance was echoed by Jio, which had also called for satellite firms to be treated on par with telecom companies.

Elon Musk responded to Jio's comments, characterising the demand for an auction-based approach as ""unprecedented."" Following Mittal's speech at the IMC, Musk expressed frustration, asking if it was ""too much trouble"" for Starlink to obtain permission to operate in India.

Despite initial reservations, both Jio and Airtel have now partnered with Starlink. Jio's announcement comes on the heels of Bharti Airtel's similar deal with SpaceX. This development sets the stage for intense competition between the two telecom giants, not only in traditional broadband but also in the satellite internet space.

The agreement between Jio and SpaceX enables the companies to explore synergies and deliver reliable broadband services across India, including rural and remote areas. Jio's position as the world's largest mobile operator in terms of data traffic, combined with Starlink's expertise in low Earth orbit satellite constellation operations, is expected to enhance the country's digital ecosystem.

Bharti Airtel's Managing Director and Vice Chairman, Gopal Vittal, hailed the partnership with SpaceX as a significant milestone, demonstrating the company's commitment to next-generation satellite connectivity. The agreement is expected to enable Airtel and SpaceX to explore opportunities for collaboration and expand their offerings in the Indian market.

""The agreement will enable Airtel and SpaceX to further explore how Starlink can complement and expand Airtel's offerings, and how Airtel's expertise in the Indian market could complement SpaceX's direct offerings to consumers and businesses,"" Airtel said in a statement on Tuesday.

These developments follow Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the US and his meeting with Elon Musk. ","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Astronomers have revealed new evidence that there are not just one but four tiny planets circling around Barnard's Star, the second-nearest star system to Earth.

The four planets, each only about 20 to 30% the mass of Earth, are so close to their home star that they zip around the entire star in a matter of days. That probably means they are too hot to be habitable, but the find is a new benchmark for discovering smaller planets around nearby stars.

""It's a really exciting find -- Barnard's Star is our cosmic neighbor, and yet we know so little about it,"" said Ritvik Basant, Ph.D student at the University of Chicago and first author on the study. ""It's signaling a breakthrough with the precision of these new instruments from previous generations.""

The finding adds weight to a November study by a team using a different telescope, which had found strong evidence for one planet around Barnard's Star and hints at others.

The new study, which included scientists with the Gemini Observatory/National Science Foundation NOIRLab, Heidelberg University, and the University of Amsterdam, is published March 11 in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.

For a century, astronomers have been studying Barnard's Star in hopes of finding planets around it. First discovered by E. E. Barnard at Yerkes Observatory in 1916, it is the nearest system that has the same configuration we do -- i.e., with only one star. (The absolute nearest star system to us, Proxima Centauri, has three stars circling each other, which changes the dynamics of planet formation and orbits).

Barnard's Star is a type called an M dwarf star, which we now know are extremely numerous in the universe. Scientists, therefore, would like to know more about what kinds of planets they host.

The trouble is that these faraway planets are far too tiny to be seen next to the brilliance of their stars, even with our most powerful telescopes. That means scientists have had to get creative to search for them.

One such effort was led by UChicago Prof. Jacob Bean, whose team created and installed an instrument called MAROON-X, which is attached to the Gemini Telescope on a Hawaiian mountaintop and designed specifically to search for distant planets.

Because stars are so much brighter than their planets, it's easier to look for effects that planets have on their stars -- like monitoring the wind by watching how a flag moves.

MAROON-X looks for one such effect; the gravity of each planet tugs slightly on the star's position, meaning the star seems to wobble back and forth. MAROON-X measures the color of the light so precisely that it can pick up these minor shifts, and even tease apart the number and masses of the planets that must be circling the star to have this effect.

Canadian government says it will follow ‘dollar-by-dollar' approach and institute 25% tariffs on US imports

Canada announced retaliatory tariffs on nearly $30bn worth of American imports after US tariffs on steel and aluminum imports went into effect on Wednesday.

The Canadian government said it will be following a “dollar-by-dollar” approach and institute 25% tariffs on American imports, including steel, computers and sports equipment.

Donald Trump first announced the tariff on all steel and aluminum imports in February and scheduled them to go into effect on Wednesday. The tariffs going into effect has started a chain reaction of retaliatory tariffs as countries around the world decide how to respond to Trump's policy.

Canada's announcement comes after the EU announced its own tariffs on American imports, including products such as motorcycles and whiskey, totaling $28bn.

Trump had doubled the steel and aluminum tariffs against Canada, in retaliation for Canada raising the prices on electricity exports to the US, to 50%. But the White House dropped the measure after Canada said it will hold off on its electricity tariff.

Meanwhile, the Mexican president, Claudia Sheinbaum, said the country would wait until 2 April to determine whether it will respond to the steel and aluminum tariffs.

Canadian and EU leaders voiced regret over the impact the tariffs will have on domestic businesses, but argued countries need to respond appropriately to Trump's actions

Mélanie Joly, the country's minister of foreign affairs, said in a press conference on Wednesday that the country will “not back down and we will not give into this coercion”, denouncing the chaos Trump has ensued on the global economy.

“The only constant in this unjustified and unjustifiable trade war seems to be President Trump's talks of annexing our country's through economic coercion,” Joly told a press conference.

Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said that the steel and aluminum tariffs were “unjustified trade restrictions”. “Tariffs are taxes, they are bad for business and worse for consumers. They are disrupting supply chains. They bring uncertainty for the economy,” she said.

Despite the criticism from global leaders, Trump defended the tariffs after meeting with the Business Roundtable, a group of key US business leaders on Tuesday. “Markets are going to go up and they're going to go down, but you know what? We have to rebuild our country,” Trump said on Tuesday.

After a week-long slump, US markets started making small gains on Tuesday morning after inflation figures that were better than projected.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Heated exchange after subcommittee chair Keith Self calls first out trans representative Sarah McBride ‘Mr McBride'

The Republican chair of a US House subcommittee adjourned a hearing after he was challenged for misgendering Sarah McBride, the first openly transgender member of Congress.

McBride, a first-term Democratic congresswoman from Delaware, elected last November, shot back at the chair and a senior Democrat on the committee also spoke up to challenge the insult.

In Tuesday's foreign affairs hearing, panel chair Keith Self of Texas introduced the Delaware member when it was her turn to speak by saying: “I now recognize the representative from Delaware, Mr McBride.”

McBride responded satirically: “Thank you, Madam Chair.”

Bill Keating, a Massachusetts Democrat, defended his colleague.

“This is not decent,” Keating told Self.

Under Donald Trump, Republicans have made attacks on transgender rights a central part of their party platform, especially targeting healthcare for trans youth, transgender troops and official recognition of gender, with the US president declaring during his inauguration speech that his government would only recognise two genders, male and female, following it up with an executive order.

McBride has been repeatedly misgendered on the House floor by Republicans and even targeted with a bill, introduced by Nancy Mace of South Carolina, to ban transgender women from using women's bathrooms on Capitol Hill. Such a ban was imposed in November.

On Tuesday, after her “Madam Chair” riposte, McBride began speaking but Keating, the ranking Democrat on the panel, interjected to admonish Self: “Mr Chairman, could you repeat your instruction again, please?”

Self said: “Yes. We have set the standard on the floor of the House. And I'm simply –”

Keating interjected again, rapping the dais: “What is that standard, Mr Chairman? Would you repeat what you just said, when you introduced the duly elected representative from the United States of America. Please!”

“I will,” said Self. “The representative from Delaware, Mr McBride.”

Keating said: “Mr Chairman, you are out of order. Mr Chairman, have you no decency? I mean, I've come to know you a little bit, but this is not decent.”

Self said: “We will continue this hearing.”

His voice rising, and gesturing towards McBride, Keating said: “You will not continue it with me, unless you introduce a duly elected representative the right way.”

Self banged the gavel and said: “This hearing is adjourned.”

Keating closed his binder of notes with a clap, and the committee left the room.

At a time of increased concern over the Trump administration's treatment of European allies, and its talks with Russia meant to end the war in Ukraine, the hearing was supposed to cover “arms control, national security, and US aAssistance to Europe: review and reforms for the state department”.

On Tuesday night, McBride released a statement.

“I was disappointed that the chair decided to end a committee hearing early,” she said. “I was prepared to move forward with my questions for the subcommittee on nuclear nonproliferation and US support for democratic allies in Europe.”

Keating did not comment further.

Self posted video of the confrontation and echoed an executive order signed by Trump in January, writing: “It is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female.”

McBride has said she intends to “pick her battles” and avoid rising to Republicans' bait, because attacks on her are meant as distractions from policies which hurt ordinary Americans.

“I think we are all united that attempts to attack a vulnerable community are not only mean-spirited but really an attempt to misdirect,” she told CBS. “Because every single time we hear the incoming administration or Republicans in Congress talk about any vulnerable group in this country, we have to be clear that it is an attempt to distract.

“Every single time we hear them say the word ‘trans', look at what they're doing with their right hand. Look at what they're doing to pick the pocket of American workers, to fleece seniors by privatizing social security and Medicare. Look at what they're doing, undermining workers.”

Speaking to the New York Times, McBride said that behind the scenes some Republicans have been “warm and welcoming”, though they have not defended her in public.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Police responded to a fistfight and shooting in which a 25-year-old man was injured

A man was shot outside a passenger terminal at a Chicago's O'Hare international airport, one of the busiest in the US, in the early hours of Wednesday, police said.

The incident followed an altercation among multiple people, according to law enforcement

The 25-year-old suffered two gunshot wounds to the lower body, according to the Chicago police department. He was taken to a hospital, where he was listed in stable condition. Another person was being interviewed, police added.

The incident followed a fistfight that broke out shortly after midnight, according to media reports, and ended with the man being shot during the brawl.

The police did not discuss publicly any possible motives for the altercation or the shooting or whether those involved knew each other. Dozens of shell casings were seen on the ground and ABC reported that the police were investigating a white BMW that was parked outside nearby Terminal 1.

The shooting happened on a street outside Terminal 2, a police news release said. Local television reports showed what appeared to be a shattered window near the baggage claim area.

Arrival lanes at all terminals were fully open by 5.15am, O'Hare said in a statement. Airlines that use Terminal 2 include JetBlue, Air Canada and Alaska Airlines.

Raquel Barajas told local station WPIV-TV that a bullet hit her window, waking her up.

“I was terrified, so I honestly, these ear plugs saved my life,” she added. “Getting up would have made me more scared and put me in a worse scenario, so I'm just really grateful to be alive right now.”

Another person staying at a nearby hotel told Fox 32 that he heard “a bunch of single shots”.

Ukraine's agreement to support a US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in its war against Russia's invasion has focused attention on what Moscow may or may not agree to, and what pressure can be brought to bear on Vladimir Putin by the Trump administration.

While the question has frequently been asked over the last few years as to what leverage Putin might have over Trump, the question here is what leverage Trump might have to persuade Putin.

On Wednesday the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said the US expected to have contact with Russia later in the day, suggesting Washington hoped for a “positive answer”.

For its part, Moscow has said it needs to be briefed by Washington before replying, with the Kremlin press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, cautioning media against “getting ahead” of themselves, while suggesting Putin and Trump could speak in person.

By Wednesday it was clear that despite Rubio's optimism, Putin intended to secure maximum advantage from talks over a ceasefire, even a preliminary and brief one.

“It is difficult for Putin to agree to this in its current form,” a senior Kremlin source told Reuters, adding: “Putin has a strong position because Russia is advancing.

“So yes, we are in favour of a truce with both hands, but we need at least framework guarantees and at least from the United States,” the source said.

The reality is that despite Russia's heavy combat losses, damage to its economy, and diplomatic isolation, it believes it is winning the war.

It sees a ceasefire as benefiting Ukraine, even as the Russian military continues to make glacial progress at a large cost, and believes that view should be reflected in negotiations.

With Rubio admitting that territorial concessions had already been raised in talks with the Ukrainian delegation in Jeddah earlier this week, what Trump has to offer Putin appears more in the way of carrots than sticks – some of which would be hard for Ukraine to accept.

Wider US sanctions and tariffs against Russia – which Trump said he was considering in recent days – to persuade Moscow to agree to the ceasefire and negotiations are unlikely to have much impact.

As Alexander Kolyandr of the Center for European Policy Analysis said: “Russian exports to the US dropped by more than 80% last year, compared to the prewar period, to about $3bn, the lowest since 1992. The only damaging banking sanctions the US can swiftly impose would be the end of an exception from the existing measures, which allows some Russian banks to receive payments for energy exports.”

The alternative is what Trump could give Putin.

The US administration's dealings with Moscow have already broken one taboo from the Biden era – deflating the widespread US-European unanimity that Russia should be diplomatically isolated.

It is in the economic sphere, however, that Russia remains most vulnerable. While the cost of war and international sanctions have not collapsed the economy in the way some suggested it might, high interest rates and low growth are slowly crippling Russia.

As an incentive, the US could offer an end to its banking sanctions and its prohibition on access to western technology, bearing in mind many non-US sanctions are likely to remain in place from countries allied with Ukraine.

Beyond that, issues become more complicated. Putin's long-term demands have not shifted: the demilitarisation of Ukraine, a commitment that Ukraine will not join Nato in the future, and his desire to hold on to annexed territory – not least the Crimean peninsula.

None of which are likely to fly with Ukraine's European allies.

Trump's one-sided pressure on Ukraine – including the recent meeting with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in the White House – may have persuaded Putin of the relative weakness of Trump's leverage with Russia.

As John Lough, an associate fellow at Chatham House, wrote presciently last year, “Trump is likely to find that Putin believes he now has the upper hand in relations with the US because of his sense that the west has lost its dominance in global affairs.”

All of which leaves one meaningful lever: increasing US military support to Ukraine.

It will be lost on no one, however – particularly after the temporary suspension of such aid to Kyiv – that this is likely to be Trump's least favoured approach.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Mahmoud Khalil was detained by Ice agents on Saturday, part of Trump's crackdown on pro-Palestinian campus protesters

Mahmoud Khalil's wife, who is now eight months pregnant, issued a statement on Tuesday night after the Columbia University graduate student and activist was arrested in New York by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) as part of the Trump administration's attempt to revoke his green card and have him deported.

“I am pleading with the world to continue to speak up against his unjust and horrific detention by the Trump administration,” Khalil's wife, who is a US citizen, said in her statement, remaining anonymous for fear of harassment.

She spoke out about the dramatic incident after Khalil was taken away in handcuffs in front of her on Saturday night, when law enforcement intercepted them as they were about to enter their residence in university housing. He was taken downtown, then to New Jersey and then flown to Ice detention in Louisiana. A court hearing on his case is due in Manhattan on Wednesday.

Khalil was the lead negotiator between protesters and Columbia University officials last spring for the Gaza solidarity encampment set up on campus in Manhattan by pro-Palestinian activists and allies.

Donald Trump called Khalil's arrest “the first of many to come” aimed at protesters of Israel's war in Gaza and claimed, without evidence, that many similar activists are “paid agitators”.

Khalil completed his graduate studies at Columbia this past December and is due to graduate from his master's program this May.

The attempt to revoke Khalil's green card, which allows him permanent residency in the US, and his arrest by the authorities, citing support for terrorism, has incited outrage and protests. Free speech organizations have called the arrest an extreme attack on his first amendment rights that “reeks” of McCarthyism.

Khalil's wife said in her statement: “On March 8, at around 8.30pm, as we were returning home from an Iftar dinner, an Ice officer followed us into our building and asked, ‘Are you Mahmoud Khalil?' Mahmoud stated Yes.” Iftar is the meal eaten at sunset when Muslims break their daily fast during Ramadan.

She continued: “The officer then proceeded to say ‘We are with the police, you have to come with us.' The officer told Mahmoud to give me the apartment keys and that I could go upstairs. When I refused, afraid to leave my husband, the officer stated ‘I will arrest you, too.' The officers later barricaded Mahmoud from me.”

She said they were not shown any warrant “and the Ice officers hung up the phone on our lawyer”. She said they cooperated fully and her husband remained calm, even though it was terrifying and traumatizing.

“Within minutes, they had handcuffed Mahmoud, took him out into the street and forced him into an unmarked car,” she said.

Khalil's wife said that the lead-up to the arrest had also been “a nightmare”.

“Six days ago, an intense and targeted doxing campaign against Mahmoud began. Anti-Palestinian organizations were spreading false claims about my husband that were simply not based in reality. They were making threats against Mahmoud and he was so concerned about his safety that he emailed Columbia University on March 7,” she said.

She addded: “In his email, he begged the university for legal support, ‘I haven't been able to sleep, fearing that Ice or a dangerous individual might come to my home. I urgently need legal support and I urge you to intervene,' he said in his email. Columbia University never responded to that email.”

A request for comment has been sent to the university.

Khalil was among several students at the elite private Ivy League college being investigated by a newly created university committee looking into students who have been critical of Israel, amid accusations of antisemitism on campus. The accusations were made during protests against Israel's military response to the attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023 led by Hamas from Gaza, the Palestinian territory it controls.

“I have around 13 allegations against me, most of them are social media posts that I had nothing to do with,” Khalil said last week.

His wife said on Tuesday: “Instead of putting together our nursery and washing baby clothes in anticipation of our first child, I am left sitting in our apartment, wondering when Mahmoud will get a chance to call me from a detention center. I demand the US government release him, reinstate his green card, and bring him home.”

She added: “I was born and raised in the midwest. My parents came here from Syria, carrying their stories of the oppressive regime there that made life unlivable. They believed living in the US would bring a sense of safety and stability. But here I am, 40 years after my parents immigrated here, and just weeks before I'm due to give birth to our first child, and I feel more unsafe and unstable than I have in my entire life. US immigration ripped my soul from me when they handcuffed my husband and forced him into an unmarked vehicle.”

Federal judge Jesse Furman on Monday blocked Khalil's deportation and scheduled a hearing for 11.30am on Wednesday. His lawyers hope to secure his release.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Two people have died in outbreak in Gaines county, and doctors fear the spread of the extremely contagious disease

Texas doctors say they are worried about measles spreading to population centers in an outbreak the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) expects to “expand rapidly”.

Two people have died, including a child, and at least 208 people have been sickened across west Texas and New Mexico after an outbreak of the vaccine-preventable disease took hold in rural Gaines county.

“It is worrisome,” said Dr Ron Cook, a family medicine specialist in Lubbock who serves as the county's health authority. “Lubbock is the largest medical center, shopping center, etcetera between Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Dallas-Fort Worth”, and a place many from west Texas visit.

Residents of west Texas “come here to shop at the big box stores – Walmart, Costco, Sam's and so forth,” said Cook, adding that Lubbock hospitals have already treated 38 measles patients from the outbreak.

The deaths are the first from measles in nearly a decade – and come as a test for the Trump administration's new health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, a longtime critic of vaccines.

Cook described an outbreak curve, familiar to those who watched infections rise and fall during the Covid-19 pandemic, that is still on the “incline”.

His concerns are shared by other local physicians, such as Dr Philip Huang, director of the Dallas county's department of health and human services, who told local CBS news affiliate: “There's concern that some of the people in west Texas are going to spread across the country. It's not slowing down. This is not over, and there will be more cases.”

Cook said people also travel for maternity and pediatric care. He worries that the immunocompromised and babies could be exposed to measles in doctor's waiting rooms.

“I personally don't think I anticipated this, although I'm not surprised,” said Dr Tammy Camp, pediatric residency coordinator with Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, also in Lubbock. When fewer people vaccinate, she said, “you always know you're ripe for the possibility of an outbreak”.

Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known to medicine. Doctors often use the example of a room full of people to illustrate this: if 10 unvaccinated individuals enter and one has measles, nine leave infected.

The CDC expects the outbreak to continue spreading and potentially worsen with the upcoming spring and summer travel season. Although measles was once a common childhood disease, it is not without risks and general misery.

The most common symptoms include a characteristic top-down rash, fever, runny nose and red, watery eyes. Severe symptoms are less common but can be devastating: about one in a thousand infected children suffer severe brain swelling, called encephalitis, a condition that can lead to seizures, deafness and intellectual disability. Between one and three out of a thousand will die.

Additionally, scientists believe that measles infection can make people more vulnerable to secondary infections for months because it suppresses the immune system. Very rare conditions can also strike: about one in 25,000 children, or the equivalent of about four each year, suffer a degenerative neurological condition called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. The disease presents years after infection with dementia-like symptoms that are eventually fatal.

The measles vaccine is 97% effective at preventing the disease. The vaccine's side effects, while uncomfortable, are typically transient, and include fever and rash. Rarer side effects, such as febrile seizure, are nearly 10 times less common than children dying from measles infection, according to studies cited by the CDC.

“Any child dying for a pediatrician is difficult, it's tough,” said Camp, about how her residents have reacted to treating children with a largely avoidable disease. “Watching them have difficulty breathing, watching them have a rash, seeing them feel very irritable and fussy – and knowing it could be prevented – is hard and disheartening.”

The overwhelming majority of Americans still vaccinate their children, and many are calling Camp to vaccinate early, she said. The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is recommended for children ages 12 to 15 months old. However, measles is so infectious that vaccination coverage lower than 95% can allow its spread. That can make a place like Lubbock vulnerable, even when it is not the center of the outbreak.

The risk has been particularly acute since the pandemic, when more children missed routine vaccinations due to clinic and school closures, and anti-vaccine activists have gained significant political power, enjoying more donations during the pandemic.

RFK Jr, once the nation's foremost vaccine critic, has responded to the Texas measles outbreak by downplaying the virus's dangers and the vaccine's efficacy, framing vaccination as a personal choice, and recommending good nutrition and vitamins.

“Then there's the rhetoric about vitamin A and cod liver oil,” said Cook, who argues that it's unhelpful to compare alternative treatments not tested in the US with a vaccine so effective it once helped eliminate measles in the US.

Camp noted that, to some degree, “vaccines are the victim of their own success”.

“When you have people who have never seen the disease,” she said, “it becomes easier to become fearful of the vaccine.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Break in talks comes as Trump escalates trade war with Canada and threatens its sovereignty

The United States has paused negotiations with Canada on a key water-sharing treaty as Donald Trump continues both his threats to annex his northern neighbour and to upend major agreements governing relations between the two counties.

British Columbia's energy ministry said officials south of the border were “conducting a broad review” of the Columbia River Treaty, the 61-year-old pact that governs transnational flood control, power generation and water supply.

The sprawling Columbia River, which originates in south-eastern British Columbia and terminates in the Pacific Ocean on the Oregon-Washington border, is one of the largest watersheds on the continent. The immense volume of water that moves along its 1,200-mile (1,900km) route produces roughly 40% of US hydroelectric power and nearly half the hydropower in BC.

The treaty first came into effect in 1964, after devastating floods nearly two decades before that destroyed Oregon's second-largest city and swaths of southern British Columbia.

Under the terms of the agreement, Canada must control the flow of the Columbia River through its network of dams to ensure US hydropower generators receive enough water and to prevent flooding. Those benefits are worth roughly $200m (C$288m) annually for the province.

For its part, the US must also give Canada half the additional potential hydroelectric power produced by dams, which it sells at market rate.

Under former president Joe Biden, the two countries reached an in-principle deal on a new version of the decades-old treaty in July, ahead of the September expiration deadline of the treaty.

Despite a concerted push on both sides to finalize a deal before Trump took office, however, the final details of the treaty remain unfinished, with only a three-year interim agreement in place.

In recent weeks, Trump has taken an increasingly combative stance towards Canada, calling its border “imaginary”, musing about inflicting “historic financial devastation” on a longtime ally and threatening to tear up the myriad treaties between the two countries.

Last year, then candidate Donald Trump referred to the “large faucet” in British Columbia that could be turned on to help a parched California – an idea widely interpreted to refer to the Columbia River.

Indigenous peoples were denied a seat at the table when the agreement was first made, despite the river passing through vast tracts of unceded territory. There were hopes that the multi-year renegotiation of the pact would finally see Indigenous rights recognized in Canada and work to restore critical habitats for endangered salmon.

While the future of the pact looks uncertain, either nation must give a 10-year notice before abandoning the deal.

On Tuesday, British Columbia's energy minister, Adrian Dix, said his government would hold information sessions later this month to help residents understand the implications of the pause.

He pledged that “we're going to fight … everywhere, including in these negotiations” amid hostility from the White House.

The US president is making energy deals with Japan and Ukraine, and in Africa has even touted resurrecting coal

Donald Trump's repeated mantra of “drill, baby, drill” demands that more oil and gas be extracted in the United States, but the president has set his sights on an even broader goal: keeping the world hooked on planet-heating fossil fuels for as long as possible.

In deals being formulated with countries such as Japan and Ukraine, Trump is using US leverage in tariffs and military aid to bolster the flow of oil and gas around the world. In Africa, his administration has even touted the resurrection of coal, the dirtiest of all fossil fuels, to bring energy to the continent.

“We've had years of western countries shamelessly saying: ‘Don't develop coal, coal is bad,'” said Chris Wright, the US energy secretary, last week. Such an attitude has been “paternalistic” and counterproductive for Africa, he added. “That's just nonsense, 100% nonsense,” Wright said. “Coal transformed our world and made it better.”

Wright built on this theme on Monday at the CeraWeek oil industry conference in Houston, Texas, where he said the world needed more, rather than less, fossil fuels. He also attacked Joe Biden for “irrational, quasi-religious policies on climate change” and claimed “there is no physical way” renewables such as solar and wind could replace fossil fuels – a view disputed by experts.

This vision of a world wedded long-term to fossil fuels could spur greater US backing for drilling in Africa, delighting business interests that claim oil and gas are the answer to bringing power to the 600 million people on the continent who lack electricity.

“With President Trump's rollbacks of restrictions, there will be new opportunities for US investors to engage with Africa's oil and gas sector,” said Robert Stryk, chair of Stryk Global Diplomacy, a consultancy helping the African Energy Chamber facilitate US-funded oil and gas projects in Africa. “It has the potential to unlock real benefits for African nations. Secretary Wright made a powerful statement. It was a genius move.”

Stryk said it was “hypocritical” for western countries to demand Africa forgo fossil fuels after powering their own economies on coal, oil and gas. “Let Africa choose its own destiny,” he said. “People talk about renewables, but it's hollow. It just keeps people where they are there, which is in poverty.”

Scientists have made clear that the climate crisis, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, poses catastrophic risks around the world, particularly in poorer African countries that have emitted a small fraction of planet-heating pollution. Africa is heating up faster than the global average and is already suffering from worsening floods, heatwaves and droughts, with countries there losing up to 5% of their gross domestic product (GDP) responding to climate extremes.

“One of the transformations caused by American fossil fuels was destroying our previously well-balanced climate and plunging some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in Africa into a life dealing with extreme weather and lost homes and livelihoods,” said Mohamed Adow, founder and director of Power Shift Africa.

“It's a sign of huge ignorance that the US energy secretary is talking up coal, but it's also obvious lobbying on behalf of the US fossil fuel companies which backs Republican politicians.”

Adow said Africa does require assistance from wealthy countries such as the US to build out renewable energy. However, richer nations have long lagged in providing the required finance and Trump has imposed further cuts, axing an initiative to help shift developing countries to clean energy, halting American aid to countries vulnerable to extreme weather and pulling the US from the Paris climate agreement.

“So they have no moral authority to dictate to Africa on the development approach to pursue,” Adow said of the US. “African leaders must choose a path that helps secure energy access and the economic wellbeing of their people. Exacerbating the climate crisis that their people are suffering from would be the opposite of this and undo the development gains of recent years.”

While the world is shifting towards cleaner forms of power, albeit too slowly to stave off worsening climate impacts, Trump has sought to entrench the status quo of fossil fuels. The president lifted a Biden-era pause on exports of American gas, and Japan and South Korea have expressed interest in investing in an Alaska gas project, in part to avoid the threat of tariffs from Trump.

“Japan will soon begin importing historic new shipments of clean American liquefied natural gas (LNG) in record numbers,” the president said last month. “It'll be record numbers.”

Last month, Shigeru Ishiba, the Japanese prime minister, met with Trump at the White House and announced plans for Japan to import more LNG from Freeport, Texas. Manning Rollerson, an environmental justice activist from Freeport, said the US exporting LNG abroad harms communities like his.

“People are being poisoned,” Rollerson said at a protest outside CeraWeek on Monday. “We got babies being born sick, and our economy is in the tank.”

In 2022, a major explosion and fire occurred at the Freeport LNG natural gas export terminal, causing a temporary shutdown and sending pollutants into the air. This highlighted the dangers of the fuel, Rollerson said.

Before the meeting between Ishiba and Trump, Rollerson travelled to Japan to meet with officials and encourage them not to make a “deal with the devil”.

“I invited the Japanese government to come look at Freeport and see what 57 years of industrial build-out … has done for this city,” he said. “It's not pretty.”

Meanwhile, a deal under negotiation with Ukraine would give the US access to the country's store of minerals, which includes oil and gas but also materials such as graphite, used in batteries. The deal could help reverse a pause Trump has placed on US military support to Ukraine, which has been fighting an invading Russian army since 2022.

Ukraine has, even under Russian bombardment, sought to ramp up its clean energy infrastructure. But the new deal could “reverse these advances, potentially forcing our nation back into fossil fuel dependency and external energy control – a devastating setback for a country that has sacrificed so much for its independence”, said Svitlana Romanko, a Ukrainian environmental lawyer and executive director of Razom We Stand.

“Trump's neocolonial mineral grab would make Ukraine a vassal state and accelerate the climate crisis while doing nothing to protect our sovereignty,” Romanko added. “The only people who win from this proposal are the shareholders of American companies and [Russian president Vladimir] Putin.”

Countries and businesses will continue to recognize the threats posed by the climate crisis, but Trump's slashing of support for renewable energy domestically and immolation of USAid and other internationally focused bodies will hinder efforts to reduce emissions, according to Jonathan Elkind, a global energy expert at Columbia University.

“To a much greater extent than ever before, this Trump team is saying that they have no problems with fossil fuels being a part of the energy mix indefinitely,” Elkind said.

“People around the world need climate solutions, not only people in very poor economies but also in the US. But Donald Trump has made clear he's not going to address this problem on his watch.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Actor Susan Sarandon among demonstrators calling for pro-Palestinian activist's release outside New York courthouse

Addressing protesters outside the courthouse where Mahmoud Khalil's detention is being considered, his attorney warned that the pro-Palestinian activist's case is a sign that Donald Trump's administration plans to crack down on speech it disagrees with.

“Speaking out against what the Trump administration is doing does not give them the right to disappear our people,” said Diala Shamas, a lawyer with the progressive legal advocacy group Center for Constitutional Rights.

“We need to fight as hard as we can for Mahmoud because of what this portends: the invocation of these draconian provisions in the law that say simply ‘we will deport somebody because we disagree with their opinions, that their opinions that do not align with our foreign policy views' is terrifying. It should scare us all.”

Shamas said she believed hostility to Palestinian activism transcends administrations, and accused Joe Biden for setting the stage for Khalil's arrest:

To be clear, this starts with speaking out for Palestinian rights but we know Palestine is and functions as a canary in a coalmine. It is because of the previous administration and longstanding anti-Palestinian bipartisan support that we find ourselves here today.

Baher Azmy, director of Center for Constitutional Rights, said that the Trump administration aimed to retaliate against Mahmoud Khalil for activism that is protected by the constitution.

“Mr. Khalil's detention has nothing to do with security. It is only about repression,” Azmy said.

“The United States government has taken the position that it can arrest, detain, and seek to deport a lawful permanent resident exclusively because of his peaceful constitutionally protected activism, in this case activism in support of Palestinian human rights and an end to the genocide in Gaza. “

Protesters call for Mahmoud Khalil's release outside court in New York – in pictures:

Lawyers for Mahmoud Khalil spoke to the press outside the courthouse in downtown Manhattan.

One lawyer spoke about the legal justification the Trump administration and federal government tried to use to detain and deport Khalil.

He said: “The government, as far as we understand it, are relying on a rarely used provision that determines a noncitizen's presence or activities in this country poses a serious risk of adverse foreign policy conflict.

“Of course, that provision is not only rarely used, it is certainly not intended by Congress to silence dissent.”

He added: “For that reason, we believe this case is not going to set the precedent that the government wants it to set, whether it's in federal court or immigration court.”

Actor and activist Susan Sarandon spoke to the Guardian outside the courthouse in downtown Manhattan.

She said: “No matter where you stand on the genocide, freedom of speech affects everyone and this is a turning point in our history.”

Hundreds of protesters gathered at Foley Square on Wednesday, just outside the Manhattan federal court holding the hearing for Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University student who was arrested by immigration officials on Saturday over his role in the college's encampment protests of Israel's war on Gaza.

Khalil, who is a legal permanent US resident and green card holder, sits in Ice detention in Louisiana. Free speech advocates have expressed outrage at his arrest. His lawyers hope to secure his release.

Margaret Jay Finch, a protester, told the Guardian she is “so upset that Mahmoud is in the darkness in Louisiana. I can't tell you.”

“I feel so bad for his wife. I am so worried that this is against the first amendment and we're going to lose our rights,” Finch, 83, said. “This is such a dictatorship.”

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has maxed out its ability to hold suspected undocumented migrants, and will seek out bed space from other federal agencies, Reuters reports.

A senior Ice official speaking on condition of anonymity said the agency has 47,600 people in custody, but is funded to hold an average of 41,500. Ice has asked for help expanding its capacity from the defense department, the US Marshalls Service and the Bureau of Prisons.

Republicans in Congress have vowed to soon pass legislation that will pay for Donald Trump's plan to remove the United States of undocumented immigrants through mass deportations.

It's another day of trade turmoil, with the United States imposing tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum and Canada and the European Union retaliating with levies of their own. Canada's reaction has been particularly forceful, considering how close of an ally it usually is to the US and how Donald Trump has mused about taking it over. At a press conference, foreign minister Mélanie Joly called the US trade war “unjustified and unjustifiable”, and said she would protest to secretary of state Marco Rubio at a summit of top G7 diplomats. Meanwhile, Trump has welcomed Micheál Martin, the taoiseach of Ireland, to the White House. In an Oval Office meeting, Trump complained about Dublin's tax policies and defended gutting the education department.

Here's what else has been happening:

Jeanne Shaheen, a Democratic senator from New Hampshire, will not seek re-election next year, further complicating her party's chances of retaking the chamber's majority.

Inflation data showed that prices remained stable last month, with no signs of Trump's trade wars driving them higher – yet.

Senate Democrats are in a bind after the House yesterday voted to pass a government funding bill that will cut their party's priorities.

With taoiseach Micheál Martin sitting right next to him in the Oval Office, Donald Trump criticized Ireland's position as a tax haven.

The island has attracted American companies in sectors like tech and pharmaceuticals who are looking to cut down on their tax burden. Trump said allowing that to happen was the fault of previous administrations.

“This beautiful island … of 5 million people, it's got the entire US pharmaceutical industry in its grasp,” he said. “I'd like to see the United States not have been so stupid for so many years, not just with Ireland, with everybody.”

He then said he would have used tariffs to stop US companies from basing themselves in Ireland to avoid taxes:

Who would have been so stupid to let these deals happen? For instance, when the pharmaceutical company started to go to Ireland, I would have said, that's okay, if you want to go to Ireland, I think it's great, but if you want to sell anything into the United States, I'm going to put a 200% tariff on you so you're never going to be able to sell anything into the United States. You know what they would have done? They would have stayed here.

Take away the threat of tariffs, and he sounds a little bit like Joe Biden:

As his administration moves to gut the Department of Education, Donald Trump levied an attack on employees at federal agency, accusing them of being lazy and saying education should be handled by the states.

“Many of them don't work at all. Many of them never showed up to work,” the president said in the Oval Office, where he was meeting with Ireland's taoiseach, Micheál Martin.

His administration yesterday ordered a mass dismissal of employees that amounted to essentially cutting its staff in half, but Trump said the education secretary, Linda McMahon, intended to dismiss only those who were underperforming:

We want to cut, but we want to cut the people that aren't working or not doing a good job. We're keeping the best people.

He went on to say that his goal was “to move education into the states”.

The idea of abolishing the department education has long circulated among conservatives, and Trump appears to be making good on it. Here's more on the mass firings:

Donald Trump's barrage of tariffs on major trading partners over various slights has spurred a growing campaign to boycott traveling to, or buying from, the United States. The Guardian's Peter Beaumont has more:

The renowned German classical violinist Christian Tetzlaff was blunt in explaining why he and his quartet have cancelled a summer tour of the US.

“There seems to be a quietness or denial about what's going on,” Tetzlaff said, describing his horror at the authoritarian polices of Donald Trump and the response of US elites to the country's growing democratic crisis.

“I feel utter anger. I cannot go on with this feeling inside. I cannot just go and play a tour of beautiful concerts.”

Tetzlaff is not alone in acting on his disquiet. A growing international move to boycott the US is spreading from Scandinavia to Canada to the UK and beyond as consumers turn against US goods.

Most prominent so far has been the rejection by European car buyers of the Teslas produced by Elon Musk, now a prominent figure in Trump's administration as the head of the “department of government efficiency”, a special group created by Trump that has contributed to the precipitous declines in Tesla's share price. About 15% of its value was wiped out on Monday alone.

The fall in Tesla sales in Europe has been well documented, as has a Canadian consumer boycott in response to trade tariffs and Trump's calls for Canada to become the 51st US state, but the past week has seen daily reports of cultural and other forms of boycotts and disinvestment.

Ireland's taoiseach, Micheál Martin, has arrived at the White House, where he was greeted by Donald Trump.

The two leaders turned to the press briefly, and the US president was asked about today's inflation data. “Very good news,” Trump yelled, before heading inside.

While Canada and the European Union moved swiftly to retaliate for Donald Trump's imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, one major US trading partner is holding off, for now.

Reuters reports that Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum, said her government will attempt to negotiate an end to the tariffs, particularly with Trump vowing “reciprocal” tariffs starting next month.

“We will wait until 2 April and from then we will see whether our definition of reciprocal tariffs will be applied too,” Sheinbaum said today.

Trade tensions are also flaring across the Atlantic, after the United States today imposed 25% levies on imports of steel and aluminum and the European Union responded with retaliatory tariffs.

In response, US trade representative Jamieson Greer accused the EU of interfering with attempts by the United States to rebuild its manufacturing sector:

For years, the European Union has opposed the United States' efforts to reindustrialize. The EU has rejected attempts under successive US administrations to cooperate effectively on dealing with global excess capacity on steel, aluminum and other sectors, employing measures that are too little and too late.

If the EU acted as quickly to address global excess capacity as it does to punish the United States, we likely would be in a different situation today. The EU's punitive action completely disregards the national security imperatives of the United States – and indeed international security – and is yet another indicator that the EU's trade and economic policies are out of step with reality.

Here's the latest on the squabble:

Foreign ministers from G7 countries, including Canada and the United States, are meeting in Quebec's Charlevoix region starting today.

It's impeccable timing, as the group of countries – Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States – are newly at loggerheads over Donald Trump's imposition of tariffs on a range of allies.

The Canadian foreign minister, Mélanie Joly, said she'll raise the issue when she meets with the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio:

In every single meeting, I will raise the issue of tariffs to coordinate a response with the Europeans and to put pressure on the Americans. This is much more than about our economy. It is about the future of our country. Canadian sovereignty and identity are non-negotiable. Canadians have had enough, and we are a strong country who will defend our sovereignty, will defend our jobs and will defend our way of living, and we will do so altogether, every single day and one day at a time.

Earlier in the day, Reuters reports that Rubio told reporters he will not bring up at the meeting Trump's plan to make Canada the 51st US state.

Canada's minister of foreign affairs, Mélanie Joly, asked Americans to tell their elected representatives that they do not want Donald Trump to pursue a trade war against their northern neighbor.

“The only constant in this unjustified and unjustifiable trade war seems to be President Trump's talks of annexing our country's through economic coercion,” Joly told a press conference. “Yesterday, he called our border a fictional line and repeated his disrespectful 51st state rhetoric. Well, Canadians have made it very clear that we will not back down and we will not give in to this coercion.”

Joly spoke directly to Americans, and asked that they make their objections known:

To our American friends, I want you to remember this, Canada is your best friend, best neighbor and best ally. Many of us have family on both sides of the border. Canada is also America's best and biggest customer. We buy more American goods than the UK, France, China and Japan altogether. Together, we have spent generations building a relationship between our countries that is the envy of the world. Canada is not the one driving up the cost of your groceries or of your gasoline or any of your construction. Canada is not the one putting your jobs at risk. Canada is not the one that is ultimately starting this war. President Trump's tariffs against you are causing that and there are no winners in a trade war.

American friends, help us help you. Please, help us end these tariffs as quickly as possible, and please talk to your elected representatives at the federal at the state and municipal level, please talk to your governors, to your senators, to your House representatives and to your mayors. Send a message to the White House.

In response to 25% tariffs imposed by Donald Trump on steel and aluminum imports, Canada's finance minister, Dominic LeBlanc, says his country will tomorrow retaliate with levies of the same amount on almost $30bn in imports from the United States.

“I am announcing that the government of Canada, following a dollar for dollar approach, will be imposing, as of 12.01am, tomorrow, March 13, 2025, 25% reciprocal tariffs on an additional $29.8bn of imports from the United States,” LeBlanc said at a press conference.

“This includes steel products worth $12.6bn and aluminum products worth $3bn, as well as additional imported US goods worth $14.2bn for a total of $29.8bn. The list of additional products affected by counter-tariffs includes computers, sports equipment and cast iron products, as examples.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Testimony comes during combative day of cross-examination which also highlighted messages involving Prince Andrew

The former chief executive of Barclays, Jes Staley, has admitted to having sex with a member of Jeffery Epstein's staff in an apartment owned by the child sex offender's brother in New York, a court has heard.

Staley made the admission at the end of a testy day of cross-examination at the upper tribunal, but maintained that his friendship with Epstein was not personal, and had always been based on business.

The former Barclays boss, who resigned in 2021, is trying to overturn the regulator's decision to ban him from taking any senior roles in the UK financial sector for allegedly lying about the depth of his relationship with Epstein. Barclays declared to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in a letter in 2019 that the two men “did not have a close relationship”.

The FCA's lawyer Leigh-Ann Mulcahy KC handed documents to Staley and tribunal judges without presenting them to the public, before asking Staley: “Do you accept that you had sexual intercourse with a woman at Mr Epstein's brother's apartment?”

“Yes,” Staley said. The former CEO, who is married and has two daughters, acknowledged he met the woman through Epstein, but while he told the court “she was part of his staff”, he claimed Epstein did not know they had sex.

“How did it come about that you had sexual intercourse with a woman who worked for him at an apartment, owned by his brother, without him knowing?” Mulcahy asked.

Staley explained that, “oftentimes I would go to Epstein's apartment and he would be late, and she and I got the chance to know each other.” This led to sexual intercourse, he said, “much to my embarrassment today”.

The ex-banker agreed with Mulcahy that he would describe the intercourse as “consensual”. The date of the encounter and the age of the woman were not disclosed in court. The FCA stated that the property was owned by Epstein's brother.

Mulcahy also put to Staley that the staff member “appeared to have carved you out of a settlement with the Epstein estate”. Staley replied he was “not aware of that”.

The ex-Barclays boss also maintained that he did not remember the context for a separate, and now notorious, exchange with Epstein in 2010 referring to Disney princesses.

The set of emails, the FCA said, included Staley saying “maybe they're tracking you,” later followed by another email to Epstein, saying: “That was fun. Say hi to Snow White.” “What character would you like next?” Epstein asks, to which Staley replies: “Beauty and the Beast.” Epstein responded: “well one side is availble [sic].

Mulcahy noted that Staley had failed to provide any explanation for the emails in two interviews by the FCA, as well as a US deposition. “You've had a lot of time to consider this email … are you able now to explain?” “No,” Staley said.

It rounded off a combative day of at the tribunal, which marked Staley's third day in the witness box. It involved discussions about how Epstein supported Staley's daughter's academic career, as well as how the late financier described Staley as “like family” to high-profile contacts, including Prince Andrew.

One message, sent by Epstein to Prince Andrew in May 2010, said: “I know you are seeing Jes Staley this morning, he is like family and can be trusted 100%.” Andrew has faced fierce criticism over his ties to Epstein, who died in August 2019 while awaiting trial over charges on trafficking underage girls for sex.

Mulcahy put to Staley that it was unrealistic that Epstein “would tell multiple people that you were a close friend and like a brother if you weren't that close”. However, Staley denied this, saying that he believed Epstein “would willingly mislead and lie about our relationship”.

Weeks later, in June 2010, Staley emailed Epstein to say: “Andrew just sat next to me at dinner. Any word on M? This is fun.” Staley speculated in the hearing that this was likely another reference to the prince, and that “M” likely referred to the former business secretary Lord Mandelson.

Staley went on to ask Epstein that same day: “is she free tonight?” Staley told the court he did not remember who “she” might be.

Mulcahy said Staley's “lack of recollection seems surprising”.

Staley appeared angry and agitated as attention turned to Epstein's relationship with Staley's daughter, particularly after the FCA showed emails suggesting the financier had been “pulling strings” to support her through her academic career and PhD.

Staley twice asked the judge for a break – though retracted the first of those requests – and said that the FCA's line of questioning was “completely unnecessary”, adding that his daughter “accomplished what she did … on the back of her own skill”.

Mulcahy said: “You're the one that said your relationship was professional and based on the assistance to your daughter … I need to explore it to get to the connection of you and Mr Epstein.”

The former Barclays boss will continue giving evidence until the end of the hearing, which is scheduled to last until Friday.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Secretary of state's visit has backdrop of trade war between US and allies and Trump's threats to take over Canada

Marco Rubio has said he is not planning to discuss Donald Trump's threat to “take over Canada” during a visit to Quebec, as Washington's top diplomat arrives to the backdrop of a raging diplomatic crisis and trade war.

The US secretary of state is flying on Wednesday for a two-day summit with other foreign ministers from allied G7 countries at the river resort of La Malbaie, the first such gathering since Trump retook power with his “America first” agenda.

When asked en route by reporters about Trump's repeated comments on making Canada the 51st US state, Rubio said Washington was working on a number of issues, including defence and Ukraine.

“We're going to be focused in G7 on all of those things. That's what the meeting is about,” he said. “It is not a meeting about how we're going to take over Canada.”

The G7, which includes France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the UK, was set up to coordinate responses from powerful democracies on global issues. On the official agenda was Ukraine, Sudan and the Middle East, as well as the Indo-Pacific region, where China has been vying for influence.

Rubio says he wants the G7 to be “constructive” but Trump's unpredictable foreign policy has left Washington's longtime allies scrambling. European countries descended further into a tit-for-tat trade war with the US on Wednesday after Trump's tariffs on all US steel and aluminium imports took effect.

Relations with Canada have reached a particular low, and Canada announced billions of dollars more in retaliatory tariffs on Wednesday.

Rubio will be arriving in a country that has united around opposition to Trump and his hyper-nationalist US ideology. At recent hockey matches with US teams, the US national anthem has been booed, while US-made bourbon whiskeys are being removed from shop shelves.

The outgoing prime minister, Justin Trudeau, whom Trump has mocked as a “governor”, has called the US tariffs “dumb” and gone on the offensive with a “Team Canada” approach to the southern threat.

The US state department has said that the secretary of state is heading to the G7 meeting to “advance President Trump's ‘America first' foreign policy agenda”. Trump, meanwhile, repeated on Tuesday his desire to annex Canada. “The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished Fifty First State,” he wrote online.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Former president was surrendered to The Hague amid a row between his family and that of the current president

Few expected things to move so quickly. Supporters of the Philippines' former president Rodrigo Duterte barely had time to protest before he was jetted off to The Hague to face charges of crimes against humanity in relation to his country's so-called “war on drugs”. According to activists, this bloody crackdown has seen as many as 30,000 people killed since 2016.

The charges brought against the former leader are the culmination of years of work by activists, lawyers and victims, who documented abuses committed under his government, often at great personal risk. But Duterte arguably would not have been surrendered to The Hague if it weren't for his family's dramatic feud with that of Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the current president.

The two families were once allies. Marcos Jr ran on a joint ticket with Duterte's eldest daughter – Sara Duterte, now the vice-president – in the 2022 election, winning a landslide victory. At the time, Marcos Jr, who capitalised on the popularity of the Duterte name, was careful not to criticise Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs, and promised not to cooperate with the international criminal court's continuing investigation.

But the Duterte-Marcos marriage of convenience descended into a bitter dispute, with Sara Duterte launching scathing attacks on the president, even threatening to dig up the remains of his late father, the dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr, and throw them into the sea.
  It was inevitable that the families' alliance would collapse, according to Prof Maria Ela L Atienza, of the University of the Philippines. Both sides want their candidate to be elected president in 2028, so, she said: “It's a fight for the survival of their political families, their dynasties.”

Marcos Jr's public comments about the ICC shifted as tension grew. His government has continued to maintain that it would not assist the court, of which the Philippines is no longer a member, but explained that it would cooperate with any arrest warrant issued via Interpol.

Shortly after the plane carrying Duterte took off on Tuesday night, Marcos Jr told reporters: “The arrest that we did today was in compliance with our commitments to Interpol. It just so happened that that came from ICC.”

According to Tony La Viña, a lawyer and former dean of the Ateneo de Manila University school of government, the arrest was a “perfect execution” by Marcos Jr's administration.

When the warrant came, “they executed it and within the day they sent Duterte to The Hague, giving no chance for the supreme court to issue a TRO [a temporary restraining order against his arrest]”, he said.

The Dutertes may now struggle to recover their power. Rodrigo, who has the most political clout, is now outside the Philippines, just as the country gears up for crucial midterm elections in May.

Rodrigo Duterte is running to become mayor in the family's stronghold, Davao, but faces a challenge from an upstart dynasty, which analysts say marks the most significant threat to the Dutertes' power there in two decades. The former president is still thought likely to win, but it is unclear how he would be able to perform his mayoral duties from The Hague.

The mid-term elections are also important because Sara Duterte is due to face an impeachment trial soon after the vote. The family needs its allies to be elected to the senate if she is to avoid being removed as vice-president and prevented from running for president in 2028.

Rodrigo Duterte's supporters have portrayed him as a victim who was denied due process by the vengeful Marcos family, and who has been wrongly handed over to foreigners. The irony of the first claim is not lost on the victims of the war on drugs, many of whom were never given a day in court, but instead gunned down in the streets.

“Suddenly they are now using terms that they were laughing at [before],” said Atienza. “They are now calling for people power, they are using terms like rule of law, human rights. It's really hard to sell.”

The battle between the families, and online messaging from both sides, is likely only to intensify. Cleve V Arguelles, the CEO of the public opinion research firm WR Numero Research, said: “It will really be crucial in the coming weeks what kinds of narratives will be offered to the public and how the public will respond.”
 He added that the Dutertes were fighting to protect their power at a national level and on their home turf. “It's all at stake now,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Ukraine president describes talks with US delegation as positive as countries attempt to repair relations

Ukraine's president has said he hopes the US will take “strong steps” against Russia if Moscow fails to support a 30-day ceasefire, agreed at a meeting between Ukrainian and US delegations in Saudi Arabia.

“I understand that we could count on strong steps. I don't know the details yet, but we are talking about sanctions and about strengthening Ukraine,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Tuesday.

Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he had got “positive messages” regarding the ceasefire, but “a positive message means nothing”. US envoys were currently en route to Russia, he added.

“It's up to Russia now,” Trump said from the White House. “Our people are going to Russia right now as we speak. And hopefully we can get a ceasefire from Russia.”

Trump did not directly promise to target Russia with sanctions if Vladimir Putin does not sign the deal, but said he could “do things financially that would be very bad for Russia”.

He added, however: “I don't want to do that, because I want to get peace.”

Asked whether he believed Putin would hold to a ceasefire, given he had broken them in the past, Trump said: “We haven't spoken to him yet with substance, because we just found out. We're going to know very soon. I've gotten some positive messages, but a positive message means nothing. This is a very serious situation. This is a situation that could lead to world war three.”

Zelenskyy described Tuesday's marathon negotiations in Jeddah, between a US delegation led by the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and a Ukrainian delegation made up of his chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, and the country's foreign and defence ministers, as “very positive”.

The talks were an attempt to repair relations after a disastrous White House meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump two weeks ago.

In Moscow, the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Russia was awaiting detailed information from Washington about what was discussed in Jeddah and that Putin must first be briefed by the US before deciding whether the proposal would be acceptable to Russia.

He added that the Kremlin could organise a call between Putin and Trump at short notice if needed.

Rubio confirmed the US would have contact with Russia on Wednesday about the ceasefire agreement reached with Ukraine, though stopped short of spelling out what consequences Russia might face if it did not agree.

“We all eagerly await the Russian response and urge them strongly to consider ending all hostilities,” Rubio said during a stop in Ireland. “If they say no, then obviously we'll have to examine everything and sort of figure out where we stand in the world and what their true intentions are.”

The White House Middle East envoy and close Trump ally, Steve Witkoff, is expected to travel to Moscow this week for a meeting with the Russian leader, though the Kremlin has yet to confirm this.

Zelenskyy said the Ukrainians had come to the table in Saudi Arabia with a suggestion for a 30-day ceasefire in the air and at sea, during which details of a more lasting settlement could be discussed. However, the Americans proposed a full ceasefire, which was agreed after calls made by the two delegations to their respective presidents.

He said that while monitoring sea and air ceasefires would be easy, he hoped Ukraine's western partners would provide a plan for how to monitor a ceasefire along the frontline, “given who we are dealing with and given our experience of the past years”.

Some Russian officials indicated scepticism about the prospect of a ceasefire, saying Moscow was unwilling to stop the fighting as its forces this week made rapid gains in reclaiming territory in Russia's Kursk region, where Ukraine launched a surprise incursion last year. On Wednesday, Russian forces entered the central square of Sudzha, the largest Russian settlement controlled by Ukraine.

“Russia is advancing [on the battlefield] … Any agreements must be on our terms, not American ones … Washington should understand this as well,” the senior Russian senator Konstantin Kosachev wrote on Telegram.

Ruslan Leviev, the founder of the Conflict Intelligence Team, an open-source investigation unit, said Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region appeared to be conducting a controlled withdrawal, ceding their positions without resistance.

after newsletter promotion

Leviev said: “All areas gradually coming under the control of Russian forces [and] have been taken with little to no resistance. It can already be said that the entire city of Sudzha is now under Russian control.”

Zelenskyy also appeared to hint at an organised withdrawal in his comments on Wednesday. “The military command is doing what it should do – saving the maximum number of lives of our soldiers,” he said.

Last month, in an interview with the Guardian, Zelenskyy said Ukraine hoped to swap the territory it held in Kursk region for areas of Ukraine occupied by Russia.

Putin has repeatedly rejected the possibility of a temporary ceasefire, saying he was focused on addressing the “root causes” of the conflict. Earlier this year, he told Russia's security council there “should not be a short truce, not some kind of respite for regrouping forces and rearmament with the aim of subsequently continuing the conflict, but a long-term peace”.

Instead, the Russian leader has set out a list of maximalist demands to end his invasion, including Ukraine forgoing Nato membership, undergoing partial demilitarisation and ceding full control of the four Ukrainian regions Putin claimed in 2022.

On Wednesday, Fyodor Lukyanov, a prominent Russian foreign policy analyst who heads a council that advises the Kremlin, wrote that a ceasefire agreement “contradicts” Moscow's repeatedly stated position that no truce will take place until the foundations of lasting peace are determined.

“In other words, we fight until a comprehensive settlement framework is developed,” Lukyanov concluded.

Still, an outright rejection of the ceasefire by Putin would risk angering Trump and undermining their warm relationship, which has led the US administration to adopt a fundamentally different approach to Moscow compared with Europe.

Reacting to the change in US policy, European leaders have rushed to come up with possible mechanisms to support Ukraine after a potential ceasefire, with efforts to put together a peacekeeping force led by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer.

However, details of how a peacekeeping mission might look and what its rules of engagement would be are still up in the air, and there is no sign that Russia would sign up to any deal that involved the deployment of such troops to Ukraine.

Russia's longtime foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, in an interview this week with a group of far-right bloggers from the US, reiterated that Moscow would not accept western peacekeepers in Ukraine as security guarantees “under any conditions”.

Ukraine has said it will need some kind of security guarantee in order to sign a lasting ceasefire deal, and the US has so far declared it is unwilling to provide one.

On Wednesday, Zelenskyy said discussions on the topic would continue. “We will talk in more detail about security guarantees if the ceasefire holds for 30 days,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Daniel Noboa, who is seeking re-election, announced the partnership with Erik Prince, a supporter of Donald Trump

Ecuador's president, Daniel Noboa, has announced a “strategic alliance” with the Donald Trump-supporting founder of the private military firm Blackwater to supposedly reinforce his controversial “war” on crime.

Noboa, the rightwing heir to a South American banana empire, announced the partnership with Erik Prince on social media on Tuesday night.

“We [have] established a strategic alliance to strengthen our capabilities in the fight against narco-terrorism and to protect our waters from illegal fishing,” Noboa tweeted alongside a photograph of the two men sitting together.

“Organized crime has sown fear and believed it can operate with impunity. Their time is running out. International aid is beginning to flow to Ecuador,” added the president, who is seeking re-election in the second round of the country's presidential election next month.

Ecuador's president offered no further details of the partnership between his government and Prince, a Navy Seal turned multimillionaire security contractor with close ties to the Trump administration.

The announcement appeared designed to bolster Noboa's attempt to portray himself as an iron-fisted anti-crime crusader ahead of the 13 April run-off against his leftwing rival Luisa González. Noboa's administration announced on Sunday a $1m reward for the capture of one of Ecuador's most notorious drug bosses, José Adolfo Macías Villamar, who is known by the nickname “Fito”.

Noboa launched in January 2024 a hardline crackdown on the domestic gangs and foreign cartels that have brought chaos and carnage to what until recently was one of South America's safest countries.

Ecuador's highly strategic location between two of the world's top cocaine producers – Peru and Colombia – and its Pacific ports have turned the country into a what experts call a drug “superhighway” ferrying vast quantities of the illegal substance to the US and Europe.

“We are at war and we are fighting against people who are heavily armed, organised, with domestic and international financial backing and a structure of terror and criminality that reaches far beyond Ecuador's borders,” Noboa said at the time.

But Noboa's crackdown has failed to halt the bloodshed and has been plagued with accusations of human rights abuses, including torture and arbitrary arrests.

The news that Blackwater's former CEO would join Noboa's campaign prompted outrage and trepidation given the military contractor's track record of involvement in abuses, including the killing of 14 Iraqi civilians in 2007, after the US invasion.

“Does he intend to do the same here?” Ecuadorian lawyer Marlon Martínez Molina asked on X, accusing Noboa of planning to introduce paramilitarism to the South American country by importing foreign mercenaries.

“Noboa is the death of Ecuador … there's no end to the terror in this country,” tweeted the Ecuadorian author Cristina Burneo.

Activist Soledad Angus Freré also voiced despair, warning: “We're going straight off the cliff.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Over 11 days of breakneck diplomacy, Kyiv was convinced of need to pacify Trump, but reconciliation may be all too brief

The 11 days of whiplash-inducing talks British and French officials endured to repair shattered relations between Washington and Kyiv, and for the first time put Donald Trump's trust in Vladimir Putin to the test, could go down as one of the great feats of diplomatic escapology.

The dogged fence-mending may yet unravel as hurdles remain, principally the outstanding question of Ukraine's security guarantees, but for the first time, in the words of Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, the ball is in Russia's court. Putin, by instinct cautious, has preferred watching from the sidelines, suppressing his delight as Trump denounced Volodymyr Zelenskyy to his face in the White House and wreaked subsequent vengeance by stopping all military aid and then pulling some US intelligence.

One European diplomat said: “Ever since the Oval Office catastrophe, the aim has been to put Putin in the spotlight, and to make Trump realise Putin is not his ally, but instead is who we say he is.”

The diplomat admitted the manoeuvre had been difficult to pull off with emotions running so high, not just in Kyiv, but in the capitals of Europe where many regarded the Oval Office confrontation of 28 February as a well-planned plot to humiliate Zelenskyy and then cut him loose, and not a meeting that inadvertently spiralled out of control in front of the world's media. Figures as senior as the German chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, accused Trump of “a manufactured escalation”.

The differing interpretations of the meeting's spectacular breakdown in part reflected wider instinctive divisions in Europe about whether the whole transatlantic alliance was salvageable, or could be jettisoned in the midst of this crisis.

Those that argued that the Kyiv-Washington relationship had to be repaired, even at the cost of concessions by Ukraine, in essence agreed with Trump's warning to Zelenskyy when he said: “You are not in a good position. You don't have the cards right now. With us you start to have cards. You are gambling with the lives of millions of people.”

Recognition of that fact started at the Lancaster House summit on 2 March, originally called by Starmer and Emmanuel Macron to report back to a small group of countries on their respective visits to Washington. But it morphed into a crisis strategy meeting to which every self-respecting European leader demanded an invitation.
  While in public Starmer embraced Zelenskyy on the steps of Downing Street, and King Charles posed for pictures with the Ukrainian leader, the heavy lifting was already under way privately to persuade him that relations had to be repaired, and gratitude to the US shown.

One reason was purely pragmatic. The big European military powers – Germany, France, UK and Poland – all thought a European reassurance force inside Ukraine would be a highly perilous operation, and probably impossible, without an American backstop.

At the summit it was agreed that the deal the US was seeking to acquire Ukraine's valuable mineral wealth – regarded as a necessary bauble for Trump – was not the true source of the breakdown in relations, it was the president's broader demand that Zelenskyy show he is serious about peace.

At Lancaster House, Macron proposed that Zelenskyy take the diplomatic initiative by offering a one-month ceasefire, a plan the French leader had outlined on the way to London in interviews with Le Figaro. In gestation for some time, it had been squared with London.
 Macron said the ceasefire would not cover ground forces fighting along the frontline in the east. “In the event of a ceasefire, it would be very difficult to verify [a truce] along the front was being respected”, he said.

In a separate interview, the French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, for the first time laid out the strategic thinking: “Such a truce on air, sea and energy infrastructure would allow us to determine whether Vladimir Putin is acting in good faith when he commits to a truce. And that's when real peace negotiations could start.”

The ball was indeed to be placed in Moscow's court.

Britain's ambassador in Washington, Peter Mandelson, lent his weight to the proposal in an interview with ABC News when he called for an unfolding plan that would require a radical reset. He said: “After what happened [in the Oval Office] it is clear we need to bring the US and Ukraine back together again. The first thing Zelenskyy needs to do is give his unequivocal backing to the initiative President Trump is taking to end the war and bring a just and lasting peace to Ukraine, and the Europeans too need to back the call for a ceasefire.”

Critically he said “Ukraine should be first to commit to a ceasefire and defy the Russians to follow” and that this “was the only show in town”.

But fury towards Kyiv remained rife in Washington, with Republicans demanding Zelenskyy appear on US TV to apologise to Trump. The national security adviser, Mike Waltz, said of the Oval Office showdown: “This was the wrong approach, wrong time in history, and definitely the wrong president to try to do this. What we need to hear from President Zelenskyy is that he regrets what happened, that he's ready to sign this minerals deal, and that he's ready to engage in peace talks.”

On 4 March, Trump suspended military aid to Ukraine, and by the following day had halted the sharing of US offensive intelligence, prompting European outrage. Through the week, as much of the EU focused on ways to evade fiscal debt rules to boost European defence spending, messages were sent to Washington that Ukraine would collapse if Trump's decision was not reversed.

The British chief of the defence staff, Adm Sir Tony Radakin, was one of the many persuasive voices to travel to Washington to argue Ukraine could not simply be abandoned. The European lobbying about the impact of the withdrawal of aid began to have some effect in that for the first time Trump started talking about potential consequences for Russia if it did not cooperate. Zelenskyy's chief of staff was also assuring Washington that Kyiv wanted a deal.

By 6 March, the US was briefing that Zelenskyy would meet US officials in Saudi Arabia to agree to a ceasefire, a clear sign that Washington had been convinced the Ukrainian leader had learned his lesson.

Trump was still blowing hot and cold on Sunday, telling Fox News that Zelenskyy “is a smart guy, and he's a tough guy. And he took money out of this country, under Biden, like candy from a baby. It was so easy. With that same attitude. And I just don't think he's grateful.”

At the weekend Starmer spoke again with Macron and the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, about the need to resume intelligence-sharing with Kyiv. Starmer remained convinced that the withdrawal of aid and intelligence sharing, while hugely damaging and potentially fatal to Ukraine's cause, was a Trump negotiating tactic to get Zelenskyy to agree to a ceasefire, and not part of a sinister conspiracy to help Russia take Ukraine.

Starmer's national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, also tested this proposition in a conversation with Waltz, his US counterpart. The key meeting last weekend was when Powell travelled to Kyiv to discuss the handling of talks in Jeddah being hosted by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman; it was in the Ukrainian capital that details of a broader ceasefire covering land forces, the role of Europe in talks, and confidence-building measures were discussed.

Powell, steeped in mediation with non-state actors throughout his political career, primarily with the IRA in Northern Ireland, is ideally placed to understand the art of negotiation. It appears he pressed Ukraine into accepting a ceasefire without clear security guarantees, arguing the issue could be addressed if and when the talks started.

In a sense, Britain and France are putting Trump's judgment and tactics to the test. The US president says all his soft-pedalling around Moscow has been to draw Putin to the negotiating table. In the Oval Office, he said: “You want me to say really terrible things about Putin and then say: ‘Hi, Vladimir. How are we doing on the deal?' That doesn't work that way. I'm not aligned with Putin. I'm not aligned with anybody. I'm aligned with the United States of America, and for the good of the world, I'm aligned with the world, and I want to get this thing over with. You see, the hatred he's [Zelenskyy] got for Putin, it's very tough for me to make a deal with that kind of hate. He's got tremendous hatred, and I understand that, but I can tell you the other side is not exactly in love with him either. So it's not a question of alignment.”

But he also spelled out his trust in Putin, in an assessment of the man's character that few in western Europe agree with: “All I can say is this: he might have broken deals with Obama and Bush, and he might have broken them with Biden … but he didn‘t break them with me,” Trump said, adding: “He wants to make a deal.”

Now the world is going to find out if the American president has assessed Putin and Russia's intentions correctly.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Security services claim to have rescued about 190 people being held by Baloch Liberation Army in remote area

An operation to rescue hundreds of people taken hostage when a train was hijacked by a separatist militant group in remote south-west Pakistan has ended with dozens killed in the onslaught, a spokesperson for the army has said.

Pakistan's security services claimed late on Wednesday to have rescued about 190 people who were being held captive after militants from the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) blew up a railway line and launched an attack on the Jaffar Express train.

The hijacking took place as the train, which was carrying about 450 passengers, was travelling through a tunnel in the rugged mountains of Balochistan province on Tuesday afternoon.

Officials said 33 militants and 21 hostages were killed, after military and security personnel launched an air and land offensive to take back control. The efforts had been hindered by the remote, treacherous terrain, which has made communication and mobilisation difficult.

The BLA had threatened to start executing hostages unless authorities met its 48-hour deadline for the release of Baloch political prisoners, activists and missing people it says had been abducted by the military.

On Wednesday night, the group claimed in a statement it had executed 50 of the hostages over Pakistan's “failure to engage in a serious prisoner exchange”.

According to local media reports, the BLA had stationed suicide bombers in explosive vests close to some of the hostages, further complicating their rescue. “The terrorists are using innocent people as human shields,” an official told Radio Pakistan.

Yousaf Bashir was among the passengers who were allowed to leave the train. Describing the moment that the train was held up by the militants, he said: “There was a huge blast. Everyone was scared and people were screaming and crying loudly. We laid down during the blasts. Everyone laid down in the train as there was firing too.”

He said militants had come over after the firing stopped and demanded all the passengers get off the train or be killed. “They freed my children, my wife and me too. They warned us not to look back and kept walking. I did not see how many people there were left behind,” said Bashir.

Those the BLA allowed to leave the train described walking overnight to safety through the rugged mountain terrain for more than seven hours.

In a written statement sent to the Guardian, the BLA said the hijacking was “a direct response to Pakistan's decades-long colonial occupation of Balochistan and the relentless war crimes committed against the Baloch people”.

Balochistan, a vast and underdeveloped region bordering Iran and Afghanistan, has for decades been home to a separatist insurgency fighting against the Pakistani state and military, which it has accused of neglecting and exploiting the region.

“The Bolan operation is a tactical response to these atrocities, intended to demonstrate that the occupying forces are not invincible and that their continued presence in Balochistan will be met with unwavering resistance,” the BLA statement said.

The BLA has recently ramped up its operations in Balochistan and has been behind some of the worst terrorist attacks in Pakistan in the past few years.

Zahid Hussain, a security analyst, said the train hijacking was “unprecedented”. He added: “This attack shows the situation in Balochistan has become very challenging for the military. They have failed to contain the insurgency and militants are recruiting large numbers to carry out such attacks.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Tesla sales are falling and apps and online groups are springing up to help consumers choose non-US items 

The renowned German classical violinist Christian Tetzlaff was blunt in explaining why he and his quartet have cancelled a summer tour of the US.

“There seems to be a quietness or denial about what's going on,” Tetzlaff said, describing his horror at the authoritarian polices of Donald Trump and the response of US elites to the country's growing democratic crisis.

“I feel utter anger. I cannot go on with this feeling inside. I cannot just go and play a tour of beautiful concerts.”

Tetzlaff is not alone in acting on his disquiet. A growing international move to boycott the US is spreading from Scandinavia to Canada to the UK and beyond as consumers turn against US goods.

Most prominent so far has been the rejection by European car buyers of the Teslas produced by Elon Musk, now a prominent figure in Trump's administration as the head of the “department of government efficiency” a special group created by Trump that has contributed to the precipitous declines in Tesla's share price. About 15% of its value was wiped out on Monday alone.

The fall in Tesla sales in Europe has been well documented, as has a Canadian consumer boycott in response to trade tariffs and Trump's calls for Canada to become America's 51st state, but the past week has seen daily reports of cultural and other forms of boycotts and disinvestment.

In Canada, where the American national anthem has been booed during hockey matches with US teams, a slew of apps has emerged with names such as “buy beaver”, “maple scan” and “is this Canadian” to allow shoppers to scan QR barcodes and reject US produce from alcohol to pizza toppings.

Figures released this week suggested the number of Canadians taking road trips to the US – representing the majority of Canadians who normally visit – had dropped by 23% compared with February 2024, according to Statistics Canada.

While Canada and Mexico have been at the frontline of Trump's trade war, the boycott movement is visible far beyond countries whose economies have been targeted.

In Sweden, more than 70,000 users have joined a Facebook group calling for a boycott of US companies – ironically including Facebook itself – which features alternatives to US consumer products.

“I'll replace as many American goods as I can and if many do so, it will clearly affect the supply in stores,” wrote one member of the group.

In Denmark, where there has been widespread anger over Trump's threat to bring the autonomous territory of Greenland under US control, the largest grocery company, the Salling group, has said it will tag European-made goods with a black star to allow consumers to choose them over products made in the US.

“We are making it easier to shop for European brands,” its chief executive, Anders Hagh, wrote on LinkedIn, although he said the company would still stock US products.

More striking, perhaps, is the decision by companies to cut ties with the US. Norway's largest oil bunkering operation, the privately owned Haltbakk, recently announced a boycott of its occasional supplying of fuel to US navy ships.

Referring to the fiery meeting in the White House between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Trump last month, the company posted on Facebook: “We have today been witnesses to the biggest shit show ever presented “live on TV” by the current American president and his vice-president.

“Huge credit to the president of Ukraine restraining himself and for keeping calm even though USA put on a backstabbing TV show. It made us sick.

“As a result, we have decided to [immediately] STOP as fuel provider to American forces in Norway and their ships calling Norwegian ports … We encourage all Norwegians and Europeans to follow our example.”

While boycotts have been a familiar tactic in the past – targeting apartheid South Africa and the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories – what is striking is how quickly the second Trump administration has become a target for both consumer anger and ethically minded companies.

Trump this week has commented on the issue for the first time, bemoaning the impact of the Tesla customer boycott and demonstrations.

He wrote on social media: “To Republicans, Conservatives, and all great Americans, Elon Musk is putting it ‘on the line' in order to help our Nation, and he is doing a FANTASTIC JOB!” But the Radical Left Lunatics, as they so often do, are trying to illegally and collusively [sic] boycott Tesla, one of the World's great automakers and Elon's baby.”

Elisabeth Braw, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, wrote for the Centre for European Policy Analysis this week: “Nobody – nobody – would have thought that western businesses or consumers would use such tools against America.

“The United States is, after all, the leader of the free world. Or was: its vote with Russia, against Ukraine, at the United Nations last month, combined with Trump's and Vance's verbal attack on Zelenskyy, along with Trump's denunciation of Zelenskyy as a dictator and a refusal to use similar language about the Russian despot, suggests to many that America is no longer an instinctive member of what we term the west.”

For some, the backlash was entirely predictable.

When Trump first threatened to impose sweeping tariffs this year, Takeshi Niinami, the chief executive of the Japanese multinational brewing and distilling group Suntory Holdings, which owns several major US brands, told the Financial Times international consumers were likely to shun American brands in the event of a trade war.

“We laid out the strategic and budget plan for 2025 expecting that American products, including American whiskey, will be less accepted by those countries outside of the US because of first, tariffs and, second, emotion,” Niinami said.

And it is likely to spread further still. Zoe Gardner, an organiser of the Stop Trump Coalition in the UK, is seeing rapidly increasing interest in the issue.

“A lot of what we are seeing is coming about organically, people putting stuff on TikTok. People are so furious, and this is about taking back power. Already across Europe we are seeing sales of Tesla falling of a cliff because Musk encapsulates so much of the problem with the Trump administration, both its culture of horrible racism and the economic side.”

US goods due to be affected from 1 April include bourbon whiskey, jeans and Harley-Davidson motorbikes

The EU has announced it will impose trade “countermeasures” on up to €26bn (£22bn) worth of US goods in retaliation to Donald Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, escalating a global trade war.

The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, called the 25% US levies on global imports of the metals “unjustified trade restrictions”, after they came into force at 4am GMT on Wednesday.

“We deeply regret this measure,” von der Leyen said in a statement, where she announced “strong, but proportionate” countermeasures would come into force from 1 April. “Tariffs are taxes, they are bad for business and worse for consumers. They are disrupting supply chains. They bring uncertainty for the economy,” she said.

The retaliatory measures include Brussels reimposing tariffs on US goods including bourbon whiskey, jeans and Harley-Davidson motorbikes, which it introduced during the first Trump term and later suspended after talks with his successor, Joe Biden.

These tariffs, which target notable US goods worth €4.5bn, often from Republican states, will snap back on 1 April. The list was worth €6.3bn in 2018 but has shrunk because of Brexit and declining US exports.

Separately, the commission plans further retaliation targeting goods worth €18bn, including a wide range of steel and aluminium products, as well as agricultural produce, such as poultry, beef, seafood and nuts. These tariffs would be imposed from mid-April, after a vote by EU member states and consultations with industry in an attempt to minimise damage to the European economy.

“We try to hit … where it hurts,” said a senior EU official, who said the bloc was targeting soya beans, which are grown in Louisiana, the state of the US speaker of the House, Mike Johnson. “We love soybeans, but we're happy to buy them from Brazil or from Argentina or from anywhere else.”

While the commission announced that its measures would total €26bn, EU officials later said they would probably target €22.5bn of US goods, as some products were likely to be filtered out after talks with businesses and member states.

However, further steps have not been ruled out. France's European affairs minister, Benjamin Haddad, said on Wednesday that the EU could “go further” in its response to the US tariffs. The measures “are proportionate”, Haddad told TF1 television. “If it came to a situation where we had to go further, digital services or intellectual property could be included,” he said.

EU officials hope that pressure on Republican states and US business will help bring about a deal.“We will always remain open to negotiation,” von der Leyen said. “We firmly believe that in a world fraught with geopolitical and economic uncertainties, it is not in our common interest to burden our economies with tariffs.”

While the UK did not announce retaliatory measures, Keir Starmer did not rule them out in future. The prime minister told MPs on Wednesday he was “disappointed” by the tariffs, but would “take a pragmatic approach”.

He said Britain was “negotiating an economic deal which covers and will include tariffs if we succeed. But we will keep all options on the table”.

Starmer, who had previously said that the UK did not need to choose between the EU and the US, had already announced on Tuesday that Britain would not respond with its own counter-tariffs, after last-ditch efforts to persuade Trump to spare British industry from his global tariffs failed.

EU officials said they were talking to counterparts in other countries, including the UK, Switzerland, Norway, Canada and Japan, but there had not been any coordination over responses.

Officials also indicated they had not ruled out imposing “safeguard measures” – tariffs or quotas on steel and aluminium from other countries – if US trade barriers resulted in a flood of imports into Europe. In 2019, Switzerland, one of the EU's closest trading partners, complained when it was affected by EU restrictions on steel imports designed to protect EU industry.

The UK steel industry warned that Trump's tariffs would have “hugely damaging consequences for UK suppliers and their customers in the US”.

Gareth Stace, the director general of the trade association UK Steel, said: “President Trump must surely recognise that the UK is an ally, not a foe. Our steel sector is not a threat to the US but a partner to key customers, sharing the same values and objectives in addressing global overcapacity and tackling unfair trade.
 “These tariffs couldn't come at a worse time for the UK steel industry, as we battle with high energy costs and subdued demand at home, against an oversupplied and increasingly protectionist global landscape.”

Bernd Lange, the German Social Democratic MEP who chairs the European parliament's trade committee, described the tariffs as “another dose of self-inflicted tariff pain by the Trump administration”.

He said the latest tariffs were “particularly bad” because “they target US trade partners, they are set arbitrarily, without legal and economic justifications, and they fail to address non-market overcapacity – the main issue steel and aluminium industry across the Atlantic is confronted with”.

The introduction of EU measures came after a day of drama on Tuesday, when Trump threatened to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium in response to Canadian threats to increase electricity prices for US customers.

The US president backed off from those plans after the Ontario premier, Doug Ford, agreed to suspend his province's decision to impose a 25% surcharge on electricity exports to the states of Minnesota, Michigan and New York.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Travellers from country now need visas with decision reportedly made in response to rising asylum claims

Trinidad and Tobago has described Britain's new visa requirement for tourists from the twin island state as a disproportionate and disappointing response to the issue of false asylum applications.

Trinidad and Tobago nationals previously could visit the UK without a visa, only requiring the electronic travel authorisation (ETA), which was introduced in January for all visa-exempt nations.

But on Wednesday the Home Office announced that people from Trinidad and Tobago were joining nationals of just two other Commonwealth Caribbean countries – Jamaica and Dominica – in requiring visas to visit the UK as tourists.

The decision was reportedly made after a nine-fold increase in asylum applications from Trinidad and Tobago nationals, with claims rising from an average of 49 a year between 2015 and 2019 to 439 last year.

Trinidad and Tobago's minister of foreign and Caricom affairs, Dr Amery Browne, told local media the UK's actions were disproportionate. He said: “This move is within their rights as a sovereign nation, but we do not see it as a proportionate response to what UK authorities conveyed to us, which was their observation that a relatively small number of Trinidad and Tobago nationals were misusing the UK immigration system by being processed for an ETA in the normal existing process and then suddenly applying for asylum after arrival.”

He added: “We have indicated our disappointment with the new visa requirement and will continue our consistent engagement with our UK counterparts. We are not of the view that regular travellers to the UK should be negatively affected by a relatively small number of persons who have been trying to abuse the British immigration system.”

A statement from the British high commission in Trinidad and Tobago confirmed that the changes would come into effect immediately, though there would be a six-week transition period lasting until 23 April “during which time visitors who booked their travel and obtained an ETA before the changes can still enter the UK without a visa”.

The statement said that the relationship between Trinidad and Tobago remained a “strong and friendly one”.

The British high commissioner to Trinidad and Tobago, Jon Dean, said: “The changes announced today align Trinidad and Tobago with many other visa national countries with which the UK shares close and friendly ties. We understand that travel is important for families, businesses and cultural connections. The introduction of visitor visas is designed to support safe and secure travel while ensuring the UK's borders remain protected.

“The British high commission in Port of Spain has worked closely with the UK government to put in place arrangements that allow Trinidad and Tobago nationals to apply for their visitor visas right here at home. We remain committed to welcoming visitors and look forward to continuing the strong ties between our people. As a valued Commonwealth partner, Trinidad and Tobago remains an important part of the UK's global community.”

Rodney Charles, an opposition MP and former permanent representative of Trinidad and Tobago to the UN, said Wednesday's announcement sent a message that the country “must be more nimble, intentional, nuanced and sophisticated to navigate the turbulent, ‘might is right' season of Trump-era geopolitics”.

He added: “If, as reported, almost 800 [Trinidad and Tobago] citizens in the last two years attempted to ‘abuse' the immigration system in the UK, then they have affected the immigration status of the remaining 1.4 million of us. In the unforgiving geopolitics of the Trump era, we must all be mindful of the fact that even individual actions can have national consequences.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

As investigators look into how two modern ships collided in seemingly calm weather, this is what we know so far

The collision between two large shipping vessels in the North Sea raises questions about how such an event could occur – and what its effect might be. Here we set out what we know so far.

A US-chartered oil tanker, Stena Immaculate, was anchored in the North Sea about 13 miles off the coast of Yorkshire, when it was struck by a container ship, the Solong, just before 10am UK time on Monday.

The Solong was travelling at a speed of 16 knots (18mph) when it collided with the tanker, causing a “massive fireball” as there was a scramble to evacuate both vessels.

The Stena Immaculate was carrying 220,000 barrels of jet fuel in 16 segregated cargo tanks, according to the US maritime firm Crowley, which manages the tanker. At least one cargo tank carrying Jet A-1 fuel was ruptured and leaked into the North Sea, it said.

The Solong was initially reported to have been carrying containers of the highly toxic chemical sodium cyanide, but the vessel's owner, the German firm Ernst Russ, later said none of the toxin was onboard.

The Solong's master, a 59-year-old Russian national, was arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter, as Humberside police began a criminal investigation. His nationality was confirmed by Ernst Russ, which said the Solong's crew were a mix of Russians and Filipinos.

The main focus of the investigations is how two modern ships, fitted with advanced radar technology, could collide in seemingly calm weather conditions.

A White House official reportedly told a US news outlet that they were unable to rule out foul play, amplifying speculation that the Stena Immaculate may have been targeted deliberately as it was carrying cargo for the US military.

The UK played down this theory on Tuesday, as initial investigations have found no evidence to suggest such a motive. The UK transport minister Mike Kane told MPs it was clear “something did go terribly wrong” but added: “Whether there was a foul play I think is speculation. There is no evidence to suggest that at the moment.”

Maritime traffic data showed the Solong travelling directly towards the Stena Immaculate without changing course before the vessels collided.

Andy Teasdale, a marine safety adviser to the Institute of Marine Engineering, Science and Technology, said the tracking data showed “something was potentially amiss” on the Solong, which was sailing under a Portuguese flag.

Central to understanding this would be recovering the voyage data recorders (VDRs) from both vessels. Often referred to as the shipping equivalent of a plane's “black box”, a VDR holds data on a vessel's speed, depth under keel, radio communications, bridge audio and radar data.

Teasdale said all those rescued would be interviewed and given precautionary drug and alcohol tests.

Dr Seyedvahid Vakili, of the University of Southampton, said at this stage it was “difficult to determine the main cause of the collision” but that in most cases “human factors play a significant role”.

Jin Wang, a professor of marine technology at Liverpool John Moores University, said human error was likely to have “played a significant role”, adding: “It seems improbable that all of the factors leading to the collision of this nature could have occurred simultaneously without human error.”

One theory is that the Stena Immaculate may have been “radar silent” at the time, for security reasons given its sensitive cargo, said Tiago Alves, a professor at Cardiff University's school of earth and environmental sciences.

This would have made it undetectable on the screens of nearby vessels, which may not have triggered the appropriate alarms on the Solong. However, it would have been visible to the naked eye from a distance.

Alves said: “The oil tanker was seemingly under a military mission and might have been found, unexpectedly, anchored in an area that is not common for ships to moor. The tanker is now visible on vesselfinder.com [a ship tracking website], but it may have also been radar silent at the time of the collision for security reasons. Only a thorough investigation will reach a final conclusion on what happened.”

However, other experts downplayed this theory, pointing out that the Stena Immaculate appeared to have its automatic identification system (AIS) switched on at the time of the collision. This would have allowed it to be seen by other nearby vessels.

Another line of thought is that the Solong's autopilot function failed. Martyn Boyers, the chief executive of the port of Grimsby East, near the site of the collision, said he suspected the Solong had been on autopilot: “If it's been put on autopilot and there's no one on the bridge, which could happen, then it'd just go straight on.”

The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said jet fuels were toxic to marine life: “Aquatic organisms that come in direct contact with naturally dispersed and entrained jet fuel in the water column may be killed.”

However, experts were optimistic that the highly volatile fuel spilled on Monday would have burned or evaporated quickly. Bacteria may also degrade the relatively small hydrocarbons found in the fuel, according to Mark Sephton, professor of organic geochemistry at Imperial College London.

The thicker bunker oil used to power the ships could be more problematic. Persistent oils such as marine diesel could smother marine habitats, affecting the ability of wildlife to regulate their body temperature, which could kill them, said Dr Alex Lukyanov of the University of Reading.

The ships collided just east of the Yorkshire coast and Humber estuary, an ecosystem of “immense biological, cultural and economic importance” said Dr Tom Webb, a lecturer in marine ecology at the University of Sheffield.

“Wading birds and waterfowl gather in large numbers as they move between wintering and breeding grounds, while soon Yorkshire's iconic seabirds will be coming inshore to breed at sites like the world famous Brampton cliffs,” Webb said.

Marine protected areas on the coast close to the collision site include Flamborough Head and Holderness offshore marine conservation zone – rich habitats supporting marine wildlife, including fish, bivalves, crabs and birds. Farther out to sea is the Southern North Sea special area of conservation, important for harbour porpoises.

Dr Leslie Mabon, a senior lecturer in environmental systems at the Open University, said: “It's close to nesting season, so puffins, gannets, kittiwakes among others could be flying around the area and could be exposed to oil or petrol. Similarly, there are dolphins and seals.

“This is also a rich fishing environment, with the Grimsby fishing port nearby, and there could be economic consequences if fishing has to be stopped or scaled back.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Tuesday's election, in which the Democrats replaced Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA), the party of the outgoing prime minister, Múte B Egede, as the biggest party in Inatsisartut, the Greenlandic parliament, also led to a doubling of seats for Naleraq – the party most open to US collaboration and which supports a snap vote on independence – making it the second-biggest party.

Ukraine president says Kyiv will not ‘recognise any territory occupied by Russians'

During his meeting with Irish prime minister, Donald Trump was repeatedly asked about the progress on Ukraine, as he played up the prospect of a ceasefire and his role in stopping the war.
 He said that the US has “people going to Russia right now, as we speak,” as he said “hopefully we can get a ceasefire from Russia.”
 The US president stressed the scale of devastation and killing as a result of Russian invasion of Ukraine, explaining why the war needs to be stopped.
 Pressed further on what the US could do to pressure Russia into the ceasefire, he said he hoped “it is not going to be necessary” as he criticised previous presidents for their record of dealing with Moscow. “What I did to Russia was very tough, the toughest ever,” he said, explaining his criticism of the Nord Stream pipeline.
 “They never took anything from me. They took them from Obama and Bush, and they took from sleepy Joe Biden. With Biden, they wanted to take the whole country, but I think I've stopped that, but we'll see,” he said.
 But Trump said that if needed, “there are things you can do that wouldn't be pleasant in a financial sense,” and would be “very bad for Russia.”
 “We could do things very bad for Russia. Would be devastating for Russia. But I don't want to do that because I want to see peace,” he said.

Britain's defence secretary John Healey has called on Russian president Vladimir Putin to “accept the ceasefire, start negotiations and end the war.”

Healey, at a joint press conference with his French, German, Italian and Polish counterparts in Paris, said:

I say to President Putin, over to you now. You say you want to talk. Prove it. Accept the ceasefire, start negotiations and end the war.

“Make no mistake, the pressure is now on Putin,” he added.

The defence ministers of France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the UK have been speaking at a news conference following a meeting in Paris on support for Ukraine.

France's Sébastien Lecornu said about 15 countries had expressed interest in discussing a new security architecture for Ukraine.

Germany's Boris Pistorius said Europe needs a much more unified approach regarding the procurement of military equipment.

“We don't have that time, it's superfluous and costly,” Pistorius said.

As journalists filtered out of the presidential administration in central Kyiv on Wednesday afternoon after a 30-minute press conference with president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the general consensus was that he had not said anything that would immediately make for a dramatic headline.

That, it seems, was the point. Eager to show the White House that Ukraine is onboard for negotiations and not an obstacle to Donald Trump's desire to bring peace, Zelenskyy seems to be trying to erase the memories of the nightmare meeting in the White House two weeks ago.

Then, he rose to the bait of the US vice-president, JD Vance, and ended up in an argument with him and Trump. Now, the Ukrainian president is making a concerted effort to retain an air of diplomatic zen.

For three years of war, Zelenskyy's natural ability to communicate – through the media and his nightly videos – and his personal charm when in the room with other world leaders, has largely been an asset. In the White House, though, it became very clear that when dealing with Trump and his entourage, a change of strategy was required.

Poland's prime minister Donald Tusk, at the joint news conference with Turkey's leader Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said he hoped Ankara would play an important role in promoting peace in Ukraine. Tusk said:

I made a clear proposal to President Erdoğan: that Turkey assumes the greatest possible responsibility in the peace process, in ensuring stability and security throughout our region.

He added that it was “very important that Nato and European countries simultaneously and effectively guarantee the stability... of the Russian-Ukraine border” after any truce was signed.

“Turkey's role could be crucial in this respect,” he added.

Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has described the news that Ukraine accepted a 30-day ceasefire with Russia as “positive and important”, adding that he hopes Moscow will respond “constructively”.

Erdoğan, at a joint news conference with visiting Polish prime minister Donald Tusk, said:

Turkey's attitude towards this war has been very clear since the first day. We do not want any more bloodshed and we hope that our two neighbours end the war by a just peace.

He reiterated Turkey's proposal to host any peace talks “if the latest developments bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table”.

And on that note, it's all from me, Jakub Krupa in London, and it's over to Leonie Chao-Fong in Washington who will guide you through the evening, including the upcoming press conference of E5 defence ministers in Paris.

Donald Trump also accused the EU of treating Apple badly over last year's lawsuit over €14bn ($16bn) back taxes due in Ireland.

Ireland fought and lost the case at the European court of justice last year and is now considering what to do with the windfall.

“Apple has been treated very badly. Apple had tremendously bad luck. I thought they had a very good lawsuit but they lost $16bn... See that is unfair,” he said in his Oval Office meeting with the Irish premier Micheál Martin.

Turning to Martin, Trump said: “I'm not blaming you. I'm blaming the European Union. The European Union's gone after our companies,” he added before launching a broadside against the bloc.

“We have a problem with the European Union. They don't take our farm products. They don't take our cars. We take millions of cars, BMWs and Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagens and everything. We take millions of cars,” he said.

Referring to the former German chancellor Angela Merkel, he added:

I said to Angela Merkel at the time, I said, Angela, how many Chevrolets do we have in the middle of Munich? … None [she said] ... You're right. We have none. That's the way it is. We have none. No, I'm not happy with the European Union.

“We have the greatest farmers in the world. They don't accept our farm products, so you know things are going to change,” he said.

Donald Trump has seesawed on Ireland in the space of half an hour.

He started off his meeting with taoiseach Micheál Martin claiming Ireland has stolen US pharmaceutical companies and tax.

But within half an hour he was love-bombing Martin.

I think the Irish love Trump. We won the Irish with a tremendous amount of vote I want to thank you very much.

“I've been there many times, as you know, and we don't want to do anything to hurt Ireland,” he said adding that maybe if he “drained” Ireland of all the pharmaceutical companies he would lose the Irish vote.

Micheál Martin has tried to redress Donald Trump's claims that Ireland has stolen US business and tax in a lively meeting in the Oval Office in which the US president repeatedly took aim at Ireland and the high presence of American pharmaceutical companies.

He told Trump that Irish firms Ryanair and Aercap, the world's biggest aircraft leasing company, are the biggest purchasers of Boeing aircraft.

“It is a little known fact. It doesn't turn up on different statistics,” he said adding about 700 Irish companies based in the US create “thousands of jobs” for Americans.

Trump told Martin: “I'm not upset with you. I think I respect what you've done.”

Donald Trump has accused Ireland of stealing its pharmaceutical industry and the taxes they should have paid in the US in a meeting with the Irish taoiseach Micheál Martin.

“The Irish are smart, yes, smart people. And you took our pharmaceutical companies and other companies. … proper taxation, and they made it very, very good for companies,” he said.

“And this, this beautiful island of its island of 5 million people, it's got the entire US pharmaceutical industry,” he said.

Trump's broadside dashes hopes of a superficial love in at the Oval House to celebrate St Patrick's Day.

Ireland's trade surplus with the US is largely driven by pharmaceutical companies including Pfizer, Boston Scientific and Lilly all manufacturing in the Ireland.

Trump told reporters in the Oval Office he was “going to take back” the country's rightful “wealth”.

He said he would have said “fine” to pharmaceutical companies that wanted to set up in Ireland decades ago, but he would have made it unviable.

“When the pharmaceutical company started to go to Ireland, I would have said that's OK. If you want to go to Ireland, I think it's great, but if you want to sell anything into the United States, I'm going to put a 200% tariff on you so you're never going to be able to sell anything into the United States.”

Trump has also said the “EU was set up in order to take advantage of the US” during his meeting in the Oval Office.

He said Ireland was no exception.

Asked if Ireland was also taking advantage by an Irish reporter, he replied:

Of course, they are… I have great respect for Ireland or what they did, and they should have done just what they did, but the United States shouldn't have let it happen. 

We had stupid leaders.

American pharmaceutical companies manufacturing packaged medication in Ireland and selling back to the US pay taxes on profits in Ireland, not the US, something that has enraged Trump and his commerce secretary Howard Lutnick.

First such study finds laws on abortion, debt and dress help increase rate of women being jailed twice as fast as for men

Poverty, abuse and discriminatory laws are driving a huge rise in the number of women in prison globally, according to a new report.

With the rise of the far right and an international backlash against women's rights, the research said there was a risk that laws would increasingly be used to target women, forcing more behind bars.

More than 733,000 women are in prisons around the world and the number is growing much faster than rates of incarcerated men. Since 2000, the number of women and girls in prison has grown by 57%, compared with a 22% increase in the male prison population.

The first global report of its kind, to which the Guardian was given exclusive access before its launch on 17 March, examined how laws criminalised acts of survival. Women were disproportionately jailed for petty theft, such as stealing food for babies and children, for begging and for working in the informal economy.

They were also frequently detained for debt, in violation of international law, said the report by Penal Reform International and Women Beyond Walls.

Sabrina Mahtani, from Women Beyond Walls, said: “Prison is not a safe space for women or their children. Yet, rather than investing in support services and community solutions, countries continue to criminalise those who are marginalised and vulnerable.”

Sia Fatmata Deen, a former police officer and president of the Freetown chapter of Go Bifo (Moving Forward) in Sierra Leone, a network of women who have spent time in prison, was detained in 2013 for more than a year after a misunderstanding at work. A bike that had been reported stolen was being held at the police station overnight and went missing. Deen was held liable and asked to pay 5.5m leone (£186). When she was unable to pay, she was imprisoned until she could get the money.

Many women Deen has met have been arrested, detained and labelled as criminals for acts stemming from poverty. The two most common offences women are charged with in the country are “fraudulent conversion” (using someone else's money or property for illegal purposes) and “obtaining goods or money by false pretence” – both fall under the colonial-era Larceny Act.

Civil society organisations said the offences were misunderstood and the colonial-era law was being used to criminalise almost any instance of debt. Other women who were imprisoned under the act included victims of domestic abuse and those who had resorted to sex work or selling drugs to provide for their families.

Deen said: “More women are going to prison because of poverty. If you have money, you will not go and sell drugs. If you have money, you will not go and borrow microfinance loans.

“Women are the ones that have needs to take care of, and if we don't have the money to do so, we'll do extraordinary things. And then we'll have conflict with the law,” she said. “There is a poor justice system in Sierra Leone.”

Women around the world continue to be arrested under colonial-era laws, including those criminalising abortion, suicide attempts and same-sex relations.

Although many of these laws appear gender-neutral, they disproportionately impact women due to patriarchal norms and systemic gender discrimination.

In several countries, laws criminalising witchcraft mostly affected women who do not conform to gender stereotypes, said the report, with unmarried women, widows, divorcees or those without children – particularly older and poorer individuals – particularly targeted.

Women's choices about their dress and appearance were also frequently restricted by laws.

In May 2022, a Zambian businesswoman and social media influencer, Iris Kaingu, was arrested and charged with “indecent dressing”, after attending a fashion event wearing a see-through black dress.

In Iran, not wearing a hijab was already a criminal offence under the Islamic penal code, but new morality laws introduced last year allowed significant fines and longer prison sentences of up to 15 years or even the death penalty for “promoting nudity, indecency, unveiling or improper dressing”.

The report warned that the female prison population could soon exceed one million, and called for wider collection of data on the topic, more alternatives to prison and decriminalising laws that violate human rights standards and international law.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Swedish firm unable to ‘secure the necessary financial conditions to continue in its current form'

Northvolt, the Swedish electric vehicle battery startup, has filed for bankruptcy in Sweden, marking the end of a company once seen as Europe's best hope of challenging the dominant Asian battery industry.

The company said in a statement it had been unable to “secure the necessary financial conditions to continue in its current form” in Sweden.

After the bankruptcy filing, a court-appointed trustee will oversee the sale of Northvolt's business and assets while settling its outstanding debts.

The company's 5,000 employees now face an uncertain future, and Northvolt said it would work closely with authorities and trade unions to give workers support and information.

The Swedish bankruptcy filing follows months of crisis at the company, as cash ran dry and it filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US in November, followed shortly after by the departure of its chief executive, Peter Carlsson. He said at the time that Northvolt needed to raise between $1bn (£800m) and $1.2bn to restore its business.

The company, whose slogan was “make oil history”, received more than $10bn in equity, debt and public financing since it was founded in 2016, and it counted the carmaker Volkswagen and the investment bank Goldman Sachs as its biggest owners.

“This is an incredibly difficult day for everyone at Northvolt,” said Tom Johnstone, Northvolt's interim chair. “We set out to build something groundbreaking – to drive real change in the battery, EV [electric vehicle] and wider European industry and accelerate the transition to a green and sustainable future.”

Northvolt was widely regarded as a leading player in European efforts to build an electric vehicle battery industry.

The company built a factory in northern Sweden, where it was hoping to use green energy to produce hundreds of thousands of EV batteries each year, but it ran into difficulties getting the facility up and running. Last year it also suspended the expansion of the plant, Europe's first homegrown battery gigafactory.

Northvolt said on Wednesday it had been forced to file for bankruptcy in Sweden after “an exhaustive effort to explore all available means to secure a viable financial and operational future for the company”.

It blamed “a series of compounding challenges” in recent months that had hit its finances, “including rising capital costs, geopolitical instability, subsequent supply chain disruptions, and shifts in market demand”.

Northvolt added that it had faced “significant internal challenges” during the increase of battery production in what it called a “highly complex industry”. The startup had previously faced criticism for trying to build several factories at the same time in Sweden, Germany and the US.

In its attempt to save the company last year, Northvolt had already sought to cut costs and announced 1,600 job cuts, and had planned to complete restructuring the business by the end of March.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Opposition centre-right party gains most votes ahead of Naleraq party, with coalition talks expected to begin

Greenland has voted for a complete overhaul of its government in a shock result in which the centre-right Democrat party more than tripled its seats after a dramatic election campaign fought against the backdrop of Donald Trump's threats to acquire the Arctic island.

Tuesday's election, in which the Democrats replaced Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA), the party of the former prime minister Múte B Egede, as the biggest party in the Inatsisartut, the Greenlandic parliament, also led to a doubling of seats for Naleraq – the party most open to US collaboration and which supports a snap vote on independence – making it the second-biggest party.

The Democrats and Naleraq each favour independence from Denmark but differ on the pace of change, with Naleraq favouring a faster pace than the Democrats (known as Demokraatit in Greenland).

The result – an earthquake in Greenlandic politics – surprised even the Democrat leader, Jens-Frederik Nielsen. The party has never before secured so many seats – it won 10 seats, an increase of seven on the last election and three more than its previous record of seven in 2005 – and was not considered one of the key players, with most attention on IA, Naleraq and Siumut, IA's coalition partner.

While the Democrats have been involved in several coalitions, they have never led a government, as they are expected to after coalition talks.

There are a total of 31 seats in the Greenlandic parliament, with 16 seats needed for a majority.

IA lost almost half its seats – going from 12 to seven – making it the third-biggest party. With no party having won a majority of the 31 seats, leaders will next head into coalition talks to negotiate the formation of the next government.

The Democrats describe themselves as being “social liberal” and have called for independence but in the longer term. Nielsen said: “We didn't expect the election to have this outcome. We're very happy.”

The 33-year-old former badminton champion said: “The Democrats are open to talks with all parties and are seeking unity. Especially with what is going on in the world.”

With 90% of the vote counted, the Democrats held a 29.9% share of the vote, an insurmountable lead, according to Greenland's public broadcaster KNR. Naleraq's share of the vote stood at 24.5%.

The Naleraq leader, Pele Broberg, said the election day would be remembered and congratulated Nielsen. He thanked voters and said: “We will work with the people of the country to honour the power they have given us. Without exception, thank you all for the day.”

Egede, who on Tuesday said it had been a campaign “burdened by geopolitical tensions”, said: “We respect the election. I'm so glad so many people came out to vote.” The party took a 21.4% vote share.

The leader of the Siumut party, IA's coalition partner, conceded defeat.

The future government is expected to map out a timeline for independence, which is backed by a large majority of Greenland's 57,000 inhabitants. The longstanding movement has gained significant traction in recent years after a series of scandals highlighting Denmark's racist treatment of Greenlanders – including the IUD scandal, in which up to 4,500 women and girls were allegedly fitted with the contraceptive device without their knowledge, and “parenting competency” tests that have separated many Inuit children from their parents.

Amid worldwide attention largely spurred by Trump, who last week told Congress he would acquire Greenland “one way or the other” and has promised to make Greenlanders rich, turnout in Tuesday's election was higher than usual, election officials said.

The election was also watched closely in Denmark, which ruled Greenland as a colony until 1953 and continues to control its foreign and security policy. Greenland, along with the Faroe Islands, is part of the kingdom of Denmark.

The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said Tuesday had been “a joyful day and a celebration of democracy”. She added: “I would like to congratulate Demokraatit on a very good election. The Danish government will await the results of the negotiations that will now take place in Greenland. But we look forward to working with Greenland's future Naalakkersuisut [the Greenlandic government].”

Kuno Fencker, a member of parliament for Naleraq, which increased its seats from four to eight, said the party immediately got to work with a four-hour meeting after a jubilant victory event in Nuuk, Greenland's capital.

This election was a “gamechanger” for Greenlandic politics, Fencker said. “Before, people voted mostly Siumut – it was like a football club that they never left. But people have had enough and voted very differently this time,” he said.

Despite all the international attention, Fencker said the election was won on domestic issues such as business, fisheries, pensions, people's livelihoods and healthcare.

He hopes that Naleraq will be able to form a coalition with the Democrats as the ruling party, as both parties want reforms on business, fisheries, tax and pensions, and Fencker believes they could agree on a path to Greenland becoming a sovereign country.

Fencker, who travelled to Washington DC for Trump's election and has been described as “Greenland's most pro-Trump politician”, said that although relations between Greenland and Denmark had been improving under Frederiksen, he wishes she would mirror some of Trump's most recent rhetoric on Greenland, but that he is strongly opposed to any form of US ownership.

He said: “I just hope that Mette Frederiksen, the prime minister of Denmark, would say the same thing as Donald Trump: that she respects our right to becoming a state and if we want to join Denmark we are absolutely open to join Denmark after sovereignty of Greenland, and that Denmark wants to invest a lot of billions of kroner in Greenland.”

Fencker said the “optimal” solution for Greenland, in terms of independence, would either be a free association agreement with Denmark or a new agreement within the Danish commonwealth.

Nielsen, however, said they must not get ahead of themselves. “We must have a calm course in relation to the USA. In relation to state formation, we must first build the foundation. We must not build the house from the chimney down,” he told KNR.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Former Philippine president expected in court within days as daughter accuses Manila government of ‘kidnapping'

Rodrigo Duterte has landed in the Netherlands and been taken into the custody of the international criminal court (ICC) on allegations of overseeing death squads in his bloody “war on drugs”.

The former president of the Philippines was arrested in Manila on Tuesday and placed on a private jet to Rotterdam by police. The plane landed on Wednesday afternoon and taxied into a hangar. An ambulance dropped medics nearby before they wheeled a gurney inside the aircraft.

The ICC later released a statement saying Duterte had been “surrendered to the custody” of the court. It added that “as a precautionary measure, medical assistance” was made available for him at the airport, in line with standard procedures when a suspect arrives.

Nicknamed “the Punisher” in the Philippines for his lethal approach to policing, Duterte, 79, is expected to be taken to an ICC detention unit and then brought before a judge for his initial court appearance in the coming days.

During his years in office, Duterte oversaw a crackdown on accused drug dealers and drug addicts in which as many as 30,000 civilians were killed, usually by police and vigilantes. He is the first former leader of an Asian country to be served an arrest warrant filed by the ICC.

Lawyers for Duterte filed a petition on behalf of his youngest daughter, Veronica, accusing the government of “kidnapping” him, and demanding it bring him back.

Duterte's eldest daughter, Sara, the country's vice-president, left for Amsterdam on Wednesday morning to help with his legal preparations.

Carlos Conde, a senior researcher at the Asia division of Human Rights Watch, said the developments were historic, and that it would be an understatement to say that victims felt ecstatic at his arrest. “This is something that's totally unprecedented in the history of this country … not just in this country, [but] for south-east Asia and even Asia,” he said.

“[Victims'] spirits are buoyed. They're very, very optimistic that this is something that can move along expeditiously in The Hague,” Conde said. “The victims here in the Philippines have pretty much lost faith in the domestic justice system, which has done so very little in terms of addressing their quest for justice. This is why they pinned their hopes on the ICC.”

Building the case had been a “very painstaking process” for victims, the families of victims and domestic human rights groups, Conde added.

The timeline for a trial is unclear, but campaigners have called for proceedings to begin swiftly.

The National Union of Peoples' Lawyers, which has represented the families of victims of the killings, said “victims' pain from loss” had been, for the day, “eclipsed by joy and hope”.

Duterte's arrest was symbolic of “a victory of the poor and marginalised, akin to that of David versus Goliath,” the lawyers' group said, adding: “We still have to press on and work for his eventual conviction.”

“There's a feeling of simple joy at what is happening, and relief,” said Brother Jun Santiago, who set up Silingan Coffee, a small coffee shop, to help give jobs to the families of victims of extrajudicial killings, and to provide a space to memorialise their stories.

On Tuesday, the cafe offered discounted drinks to customers to encourage people to visit and learn about the abuses that were committed under Duterte's government. Santiago described the arrest as a “first step to justice”.

Duterte's arrest was widely celebrated among human rights groups, with the Philippine rights alliance Karapatan describing the development as “long overdue”.

Duterte's supporters have argued that, as the Philippines withdrew from the Rome statute in 2019, the ICC no longer has jurisdiction. However, the court has previously said it retains jurisdiction for alleged crimes that occurred in the country before its withdrawal.

The official Facebook page of the vice-president's office shared an image of a red ribbon with the text “BRING PRRD HOME” – referring to President Rodrigo Roa Duterte.

The country's president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, told reporters on Tuesday night that he was confident “the arrest was proper, correct and followed all necessary legal procedures”. He added: “We did not help the international criminal court in any way. The arrest was made in compliance with Interpol.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Complaints upheld against some former South Yorkshire and West Midlands officers but none will face proceedings

Dozens of allegations of misconduct against police officers relating to the 1989 Hillsborough disaster have been upheld by the police standards watchdog, bereaved families have been told.

However, none will face disciplinary proceedings because they have all left the police service.

The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said it had upheld complaints against some former South Yorkshire police officers, and some who were serving at the West Midlands force, for misconduct during its original investigation into the disaster.

In letters sent to bereaved family members this week, the IOPC deputy director general Kathie Cashell said almost 100 people had made a total of 354 complaints of misconduct, the investigations into some of which were still being finalised – which meant it could not yet confirm the full number upheld.

“However, to date just over half of complainants have had at least one complaint upheld, or in our opinion there would have been a case to answer for misconduct for one or more officers, had they remained serving,” she wrote. “I understand that for many it will be disappointing that this number is not higher.”

On 15 April 1989, 97 men, women and children, aged from 10 to 67, were killed in the lethal crush at Sheffield Wednesday's Hillsborough stadium at an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.

Even as people were dying, South Yorkshire police mounted a false narrative that the disaster had been caused by Liverpool supporters arriving in large numbers late, drunk and without tickets. Bereaved families, survivors, supporters and campaigners relentlessly fought the case, accusing the force of lying to cover up its responsibility.

Many survivors, including some who were under 18 at the time, have complained about how West Midlands police officers questioned them, and the IOPC said it had upheld some of those complaints.

In April 2016, the jury at new inquests – held after a 1991 inquest verdict of accidental death was quashed in 2012 – determined that those who died had been unlawfully killed due to gross negligence manslaughter by Ch Supt David Duckenfield, the officer in charge of match safety.

The jury also determined that no behaviour of Liverpool supporters contributed to the disaster. Families have long protested that no police officer faced disciplinary proceedings for the mismanagement that caused the disaster or the false narrative. Duckenfield was prosecuted for gross negligence manslaughter and acquitted in 2019.

Cashell informed complainants that the IOPC's investigations had reached the same conclusions as the jury at the new inquests. She said complaints had been upheld against senior South Yorkshire officers for the policing of the match and against a number of other officers for being abusive of supporters at the match and some for “excessive use of force”.

However, she said most complaints against police officers for seeking “to deflect the blame” had not been upheld because there was no legal duty at the time for the police to be candid.

Bereaved families and their lawyers have campaigned for a “Hillsborough law” that would impose a statutory duty of candour on police and public officials. The government has promised to introduce it in some form by next month, the 36th anniversary of the disaster.

Cashell wrote: “Like the HIP [Hillsborough independent panel] report, our investigations did find evidence to support allegations that in the aftermath of the disaster, South Yorkshire police sought to deflect the blame from themselves. We found no evidence to support claims that the behaviour of supporters was a contributing factor.

“In the majority of cases, we were unable to find the officers had a case to answer for misconduct because the professional standards for policing at the time did not include a specific duty of candour. Despite the wider public interest to gain answers about what happened, South Yorkshire police was entitled, within the law at the time, to present its ‘best case' and be selective with the evidence it presented.”

Cashell said the IOPC would inform complainants, who include bereaved families and survivors of the disaster, of the findings regarding individual complaints by 28 March.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

FCA and Bank of England's PRA join retreat from efforts to help underrepresented groups, citing ‘regulatory burdens'

The City's top two regulators have said they will not bring in new diversity and inclusion rules for financial firms because they want to avoid imposing extra “regulatory burdens” and costs, in the latest sign of a retreat from efforts to help underrepresented groups.

The Bank of England's regulatory arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said they would instead support “voluntary industry initiatives” aimed at boosting diversity and inclusion in the financial sector.

The announcement coincides with a rollback in the US of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies that has accelerated under Donald Trump, and with a push by the UK government to reduce regulation to help stimulate economic growth.

Sam Woods, a deputy governor at the Bank who leads the PRA, wrote in a letter to Meg Hillier, the chair of parliament's Treasury committee, and the FCA's chief executive, Nikhil Rathi, were choosing to “remain alert to the risks of groupthink” within its existing supervisory framework rather than asking companies to report what measures they were taking to improve representation of women and minorities in their organisations.

The move comes after an inquiry into sexism and misogyny in the City, by the influential Treasury committee, which examined barriers faced by women in financial services, and looked into whether progress had been made on the gender pay gap, stigma against working mothers, and the sector's “alpha male” culture.

The committee renewed a 2018 inquiry into gender inequality in financial services, after a spate of sexual harassment allegations that rocked the business world, and explored what role regulators, including the FCA, should play in “combating sexual harassment and misogyny”.

However, a March 2024 report found that “not much” had changed in the intervening period, and it welcomed proposals by the PRA and the FCA to strengthen their non-financial misconduct rules and improve their ability to take action against perpetrators of sexual harassment.

In the letter, Woods wrote that the PRA and FCA – which also scrapped a plan to ‘name and shame' UK firms under investigation on Wednesday – believed diversity and inclusion initiatives could benefit firms.

“We continue to think that an appropriate focus on diversity and inclusion in the culture of the firms we regulate can deliver improved internal governance, decision-making and risk management,” Woods wrote.

He added that such focus “can support both safety and soundness – through reduced risk of groupthink – and the competitiveness of UK financial services over the medium to long term”.

However, after consultations with the companies it regulates, and with the Treasury committee, Woods said that financial firms did not want regulators to introduce new rules including gender and ethnicity pay gap reporting, at a time when the government was planning to bring in new legal reporting requirements for companies.

“Many of those who responded to our consultation wanted us to align our regulatory approach with related initiatives, to avoid duplication and unnecessary costs,” he wrote, in a move that could be interpreted as a response to the government's call for UK regulators to do more to support growth.

Woods added: “There is also a growing emphasis in our work on reducing regulatory burdens on firms while still delivering our objectives, and adding significant new requirements in this area could be seen as in tension with that approach.”

The Treasury committee has previously expressed its concerns that City regulators could require financial firms to collect and report diversity and inclusion data, and set targets, which it said “well-run firms” should already be doing.

“We do not currently plan to publish new rules on diversity and inclusion, and do not intend to return to this question until after the substantive implementation of any new legislation in this area,” Woods wrote.

Donald Trump has prompted a rollback of DEI programmes in the US, after he signed a series of executive orders overturning such measures. Several large US corporations, including Walmart, McDonald's, Ford and Amazon, followed suit in either scrapping or scaling back their DEI schemes, while the Facebook owner, Meta, overhauled its content moderation to remove restrictions on topics such as gender and immigration.

Separately on Wednesday, it emerged the Bank of England has offered staff a 3% pay rise in 2025-26, a deal which may disappoint some staff as it only matches the UK's current level of inflation, as the central bank's own forecasters have predicted prices will start rising again this year.

The pay rise, reported by Bloomberg, is lower than the previous year, as a result of “budget constraints” according to a Bank spokesperson, although it added that the majority of Unite union members have voted in favour of the deal.

It highlights the pressures on the central bank to retain staff and attract new employees in the race for talent, at the same time as keeping its budget under control, and after its governor, Andrew Bailey, was criticised for suggesting workers should avoid asking for big pay rises in order to help control inflation.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Remains brought to Britain as part of colonialism, such as Egyptian mummies, should be repatriated, a report says

The public display of human remains in the UK, including the ancient Egyptian mummies in the British Museum, is offensive and should be stopped, according to a group of MPs.

A report by the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Afrikan Reparations (APPG-AR) said it should become an offence to sell ancestral remains or publicly display them without consent.

The report, Laying Ancestors to Rest, which is primarily concerned with African ancestral remains, said the possession by museums and universities of body parts brought to the UK as a result of enslavement and colonialism caused profound distress to their descendants, diaspora communities and countries of origin.

It calls for human remains, which include bones, skeletons, skin, hair and tissue incorporated into cultural artefacts, to be repatriated to their countries of origin wherever possible. The law should be changed to allow national museums, such as the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Science Museum and the Natural History Museum, to remove, or “deaccession”, remains in their permanent collections.

MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy, the chair of the APPG-AR, said the report's recommendations would help address the racial injustice wrought by the colonial trade in human remains.

“Putting human remains on display is unethical, especially when no consent has been given,” she added. “I think removing the display of these items ultimately changes the culture, goes some way to look at them with some form of respect.”

There has been growing ethical debate in recent years over the display of Egyptian pharaoh's mummies, with many in the museum sector now referring to them as mummified persons as a mark of respect, although they remain popular attractions.

Ribeiro-Addy said: “I would like people to imagine taking the remains of our monarchs to another country and putting them on display. Even if they kept them in their coffins, would we think that was acceptable?”

Currently, anyone can possess, buy and sell human body parts as long as they were not acquired illegally, and they are not used for transplants, only for decoration. But the APPG-AR proposes that the sale of human remains should be outlawed on the grounds that they are not commercial objects but human beings.

“We've seen foetus earrings, we've seen foetuses in jars, the spine of a six-year-old being used as a handbag, the thigh bone of someone being fashioned into a cane, and all of these things are allowed to happen because they've altered them for art,” said Ribeiro-Addy.

The report calls on the government to amend the Human Tissue Act 2004, which regulates the acquisition, storage, use and disposal of bodies, organs and tissue, to cover remains more than 100 years old.

Iben Bo, the author of the policy brief, said the act currently failed to take into account that ancestral remains held in the UK were looted from Africa. For example, she said Egyptian mummified persons were excavated and brought back to Britain, for racist pseudoscientific research.

“African diaspora communities expressed disgust with ancestral remains [being] on display because the museum space is not constructed as a cemetery where you go to pay your respects. There's noise and children running around,” said Bo, the lead research consultant of the African Ancestral Remains project.

Zaki El-Salahi, a member of the Sudanese community in Edinburgh, said he was shocked when he first saw body parts of his ancestors in the Anatomical Museum in the University of Edinburgh and is now part of an academic group seeking to address the institution's links to slavery and colonialism. The remains were taken by British colonisers after the Battle of Omdurman in 1898, in which British commanders used early machine guns and artillery to inflict thousands of casualties on lightly armed enemies.

He said: “It was very much that kind of deep human threat response, which was for me, fight and freeze. It was that there was something deeply wrong here, a huge injustice, connecting the city that I've lived in for 18 years to my family's home town.”

Under the APPG-AR's proposals, museums, universities and other institutions would require a licence to store ancestral remains, and could not display them except for religious purposes or unless they obtained appropriate consent.

The report also suggests creating a memorial or burial site in the UK for ancestral remains which cannot be returned because their exact origins have been destroyed owing to colonial violence.

A British Museum spokesperson said: “The museum is mindful of ethical obligations and closely follows the guidance set out by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport and the Human Tissue Act 2004, which ensures that human remains held in its care are always treated and displayed with respect and dignity.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Created by a South Korean artist suffering burnout, the serious but absurd contest is just one of 65 events coming to Melbourne's Rising festival

 Get our weekend culture and lifestyle email

Are you good at doing nothing? If you are in Melbourne later this year, you'll be able to put your skills to the test in a “Space-out competition” – in which participants compete to see who can zone out the most over 90 minutes.

The Space-out competition was started by the South Korean artist Woopsyang after she experienced burnout while working a stressful advertising job. Posed as a challenge to hustle culture, the competition has been held in busy parts of Seoul, Hong Kong and Tokyo, and will be held in Melbourne's bustling QV mall this June, as part of Rising festival, the city's annual winter arts festival.

Participants are disqualified if they laugh, check their phones or fall asleep, and are encouraged to come in their work clothes or uniform. Two winners are chosen at each competition: the contestant with the most stable heart rate and the crowd favourite, with an overall winner selected from the two.

The Rising festival co-curator Hannah Fox watched the Space-out competition held in Tokyo last year and found herself “fascinated in a particular kind of civic participatory performance that is quite popular in Seoul”.

“There was a running commentary for the entire competition, but it was being whispered, which I really enjoyed,” she laughs. “It was taken so seriously, like a proper Olympic competition.

“It is tied into themes of the resilience of artists who often work really intense jobs as well as have a practice. It is serious but it's also got a whole level of total absurdity to it – who can do the most nothing the best?”

The Space-out competition is one of 65 events involving 327 artists at this year's Rising festival, now a staple of Melbourne's arts scene in winter, which will run 4-15 June this year.

As in previous years, Rising will again take over venues and areas around the city. Federation Square will be transformed for Blockbuster, an all-day celebration of culture, art and food from Pakistan and Punjab, while the Japanese artist Shohei Fujimoto will stage a huge light show in the historic Capitol theatre, which will be free to the public.

In Melbourne's City Baths, the local sound artist Sara Retallick will stage Saturate, an audio artwork that can only be heard underwater in the historic bathhouse. And the Flinders Street Station Ballroom will house Swingers, a playable mini-golf course celebrating the sport's feminist history with each hole created by a different female artist, including the US artist Miranda July, Yankunytjatjara artist Kaylene Whiskey and Australian duo Soda Jerk.

Musical acts performing at Rising this year include Portishead's Beth Gibbons, who will perform her debut solo album Lives Outgrown in Hamer Hall; English singer Suki Waterhouse; US indie pop band Japanese Breakfast; New Zealand singer Marlon Williams; Kaytetye DJ Rona; US singer Soccer Mommy; and Pete & Bas, the London septuagenarian rap duo and TikTok favourites, who will be performing in Australia for the first time.

Australian theatre coming to Rising includes POV, which sees an 11-year-old girl bring two new actors on stage with her each night to play her parents. None of the actors will see the script before going on stage, but will be given one instruction each: come up with an explanation for bipolar disorder that a child can understand, and practice a Werner Herzog accent. “We are looking at a family break-up through the eyes of a child, which is something that we don't often see,” the Rising co-curator Gideon Obarzanek said.

There is also the new staging of Hedwig and the Angry Inch, which received five stars from Guardian Australia at Adelaide festival; the famous queer musical will head to the Athenaeum with Filipino-Australian singer Seann Miley Moore in the titular role.

The playwright S Shakthidharan, creator of the internationally acclaimed Counting and Cracking, will stage his new play The Wrong Gods, while the Prima Facie actor Sheridan Harbridge will star as the Divinyls frontwoman Chrissy Amphlett in cabaret show Amplified: The Exquisite Rock and Rage of Chrissy Amphlett.

International shows include Blkdog, by the acclaimed London choreographer Botis Seva; Kill Me, a dance show by the Argentinian choreographer Marina Otero, who has made a lifelong commitment to document her life via performance; and British show Complete Works: Table Top Shakespeare, in which Shakespeare plays are condensed into something that can be performed with objects on a table.

Another Shakespeare-adjacent play is Hamlet – but this is performed by eight actors with Down syndrome, from Peruvian theatre company Teatro La Plaza. “They're not really talking about a lone, depressed Danish prince – they are really talking about their community,” Obarzanek said. “It's really incredible – one of the most moving, powerful shows I've ever seen.”

Rising has built a reputation on mass events that encourage participation, which Fox said she hoped went deeper than simply “immersive”.

“Things like Space-out, even 10,000 Kazoos, ask the audience to become a part of making something,” she said. “That is a real point of distinction, but also so needed – the loneliness epidemic is real. This is about bringing people together into something greater than themselves.”

Ministers must cover full costs of championing western values abroad, senior BBC figures to argue

Ministers must take on the full costs of the BBC's World Service to counter an “aggressive” disinformation drive by Russia around the globe, BBC bosses are preparing to argue.

Amid concerns about the scale of state-backed content after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, senior BBC figures believe it is “undeniable” that the government should shoulder the costs of championing “western values” via the financially strained World Service.

There have been concerns from within the BBC that Russian and Chinese state media are spending an “eyewatering” £8bn a year, compared with the World Service's £400m budget.

“They're doing it for a reason,” said a BBC source. “The views and opinions of nations around the world strategically matter. It's only the BBC that has the global reach to actually do something about this. We believe in western values and they are under attack.”

There is also evidence that Russia has been targeting former World Service audiences where budget cuts have forced the BBC to retreat. When the BBC's Arabic radio service withdrew from Lebanon, its radio frequency was taken over by the state-owned Russian Sputnik Radio.

Figures inside the BBC also think it is unfair that licence fee-payers in the UK pay for content delivered to audiences overseas.

The push to hand the costs of the World Service back to the government is an early skirmish in what are set to be lengthy negotiations over its remit and funding as part of the corporation's charter renewal process. Those talks are scheduled to run until 2027.

Jonathan Munro, the global director of BBC News, said: “The BBC World Service is a uniquely valuable asset that provides trusted independent and impartial news to audiences around the world.

“As press freedom drastically reduces, disinformation thrives and state-backed media advance aggressively, its role is increasingly important. We need a sustainable, long term funding solution that enables the World Service to meet these global challenges and invest in services for the future.”

Before 2014, the government held sole responsibility for funding the World Service, an international news service available on radio, television and online that provides news and analysis around the world in more than 40 languages. However, as part of the cost-cutting measures pursued by the coalition government from 2010, the costs of providing the service were loaded on to the corporation itself.

Under the latest funding settlement, about two-thirds of the costs of the World Service come from the licence fee, with the rest made up from government grants.

Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, said recently that she believed the World Service's funding model was unsustainable. She said that with the “challenges in the world being so great”, successive governments have had to step in with additional funding to safeguard it.

The World Service has already had to make cuts this year as the BBC struggles with the two-year freeze in the licence fee. It was announced in January that 130 jobs would go as part of plans to save about £6m. It included cuts to BBC Monitoring, which analyses news from media around the world.

While BBC bosses think they have a strong case, persuading the Treasury to find the extra money is a tall order. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has left herself little room for manoeuvre after ruling out any more large tax increases and her self-imposed fiscal rules significantly restrict her spending options.

Meanwhile, she has already had to accommodate Keir Starmer's decision to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027 – worth an additional £6bn a year – by slashing international aid. The prime minister announced the move before his meeting with Donald Trump in Washington last month.

Government sources said that all issues relating to the BBC's funding would be examined as part of the charter renewal process. They also said the last spending review included 31% increase in the World Service's government funding for 2025-26, to £137m. The figure was £20m less than the BBC had asked for during negotiations.

A spokesperson for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: “The government highly values the BBC World Service, which reaches a global audience of 320 million, and remains the world's most trusted international news service.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Swings between drought and floods striking from Dallas to Shanghai, while Madrid and Cairo are among cities whose climate has flipped

Climate whiplash is already hitting major cities around the world, bringing deadly swings between extreme wet and dry weather as the climate crisis intensifies, a report has revealed.

Dozens more cities, including Lucknow, Madrid and Riyadh have suffered a climate “flip” in the last 20 years, switching from dry to wet extremes, or vice versa. The report analysed the 100 most populous cities, plus 12 selected ones, and found that 95% of them showed a distinct trend towards wetter or drier weather.

The changing climate of cities can hit citizens with worsened floods and droughts, destroy access to clean water, sanitation and food, displace communities and spread disease. Cities where the water infrastructure is already poor, such as Karachi and Khartoum, suffer the most.

Cities across the world are affected but the data shows some regional trends, with drying hitting Europe, the already-parched Arabian peninsula and much of the US, while cities in south and south-east Asia are experiencing bigger downpours.

The analysis illustrates the climate chaos being brought to urban areas by human-caused global heating. Too little or too much water is the cause of 90% of climate disasters. More than 4.4 billion people live in cities and the climate crisis was already known to be supercharging individual extreme weather disasters across the planet.

Rising temperatures, driven by fossil fuel pollution, can exacerbate both floods and droughts because warmer air can take up more water vapour. This means the air can suck more water from the ground during hot, dry periods but also release more intense downpours when the rains come.

“Our study shows that climate change is dramatically different around the world,” said Prof Katerina Michaelides, at the University of Bristol, UK. Her co-author, Prof Michael Singer at Cardiff University, described the pattern as “global weirding”.

“Most places we looked at are changing in some way, but in ways that are not always predictable,” Singer said. “And given that we're looking at the world's largest cities, there are really significant numbers of people involved.”

Coping with climate whiplash and flips in cities is extremely hard, said Michaelides. Many cities already face water supply, sewage and flood protection problems as their populations rapidly swell. But global heating supercharges this, with the often ageing infrastructure in rich nations designed for a climate that no longer exists, and more climate extremes making the establishment of much-needed infrastructure even harder in low income nations.

The researchers have worked in Nairobi, Kenya, one of the cities suffering climate whiplash. “People were struggling with no water, failed crops, dead livestock, with drought really impacting their livelihoods and lives for multiple years,” Michaelides said. “Then the next thing that happens is too much rain, and everything's flooded, they lose more livestock, the city infrastructure gets overwhelmed, water gets contaminated, and then people get sick.”

Sol Oyuela, executive director at NGO WaterAid, which commissioned the analysis, said: “The threat of a global ‘day zero' looms large – what happens when the 4 billion people already facing water scarcity reach that breaking point, and the food, health, energy, nature, economies, and security that depend on water are pushed to the brink?”

“Now is the time for urgent collective action, so communities can recover from disasters and be ready for whatever the future holds. This will make the world a safer place for all,” Oyuela said.

The savage wildfires in Los Angeles in January were an example of a single whiplash event, with a wet period spurring vegetation growth, which then fuelled the fires when hot and dry weather followed. Such events are increasing due to human-caused global heating.

The new analysis by Michaelides and Singer was much broader and examined the changes in wet and dry extremes over the past four decades in 112 major cities.

It found that 17 cities across the globe have been hit by climate whiplash, suffering more frequent extremes of both wet and dry conditions. The biggest whiplashes were seen in Hangzhou in China, the Indonesian megacity of Jakarta, and Dallas in Texas. Other whiplash cities include Baghdad, Bangkok, Melbourne and Nairobi. The rapid shift between wet and dry extremes makes it difficult for cities to prepare and recover, damaging lives and livelihoods.

The analysis also found that 24 cities have seen dramatic climate flips this century. The sharpest switches from wet to dry conditions have been in Cairo, Madrid and Riyadh, with Hong Kong and San Jose in California also in the top 10. Prolonged droughts can lead to water shortages, disrupted food supplies and electricity blackouts where hydropower is relied upon.

The sharpest switches from dry to wet conditions were in Lucknow and Surat in India and in Nigeria's second city, Kano. Other cities with wet flips were Bogotá, Hong Kong and Tehran. Intense rains can cause flash floods, destroying homes and roads and spreading deadly waterborne diseases like cholera and dysentery when sanitation systems are overwhelmed.

The researchers also assessed the level of social vulnerability and quality of infrastructure in the cities. The cities with the biggest increases in climate hazards combined with the highest vulnerability – and therefore the places facing the greatest dangers – were Khartoum in Sudan, Faisalabad in Pakistan, and Amman in Jordan.

Karachi, also in Pakistan, ranked highly for vulnerability as well and is experiencing more wet extremes. Torrential rains in 2022 destroyed the family home of fisher Mohammad Yunis in Ibrahim Hyderi, a waterfront district in the city.

“We have spent many days and nights completely drenched in rain because we had no shelter,” he said. “The weather affects everything. When it rains heavily, our children fall sick. But we don't have sufficient [clean] water. Our localities are breaking down. Houses near the drainage systems collapse due to floods. When floods come, walls fall apart. If we had enough money, we would not be living here.”

Even in the cities where the changes in climate were less stark, clear trends were seen in almost all of them. The places getting drier over the last 40 years included Paris, Los Angeles, Cape Town, and Rio de Janeiro. Many of those getting wetter are in south Asia, such as Mumbai, Lahore and Kabul.

The researchers also found 11 cities where the number of extreme wet or dry months had fallen in the last 20 years, including Nagoya in Japan, Lusaka in Zambia, and Guangzhou in China.

The overall results of the new study are consistent with the most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which found there were both regions with increases in heavy rains and others with increases in drought, as well as some regions with increases in both, said Prof Sonia Seneviratne, at ETH Zurich in Switzerland, coordinating lead author of the IPCC chapter on weather and climate extreme events.

“A few tenths of a degree warmer and the life we know becomes increasingly at risk due to climate extremes such as heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall,” she said.

Singer said: “We hope our report can galvanise global attention on the challenges of climate change with respect to water. Perhaps it will lead to a more realistic conversation about supporting adaptation to climate change, with a sense of compassion and understanding of the challenges people are facing, rather than just saying, well, we can't afford it.”

Methodology

The researchers analysed the changing climate of cities using a standard index (SPEI) that combined precipitation with evaporation each month from 1983 to 2023. Index values above a widely-used threshold were categorised as extreme.

To assess changes over the four decades, the data was split into two 21-year periods. The cities that experienced at least 12 months more of one type of extreme climate (wet or dry) and at least 12 months less of the other type of extreme climate in the second 21-year period were classed as having a climate flip. The cities that had at least five months more of both extreme wet and extreme dry in the second period were classed as having developed climate whiplash. The overall wetting or drying trends were determined from all 42 years of data.

The population data used to determine the 100 most populous cities was based on population density, not the administrative boundaries of the city, and therefore are a truer reflection of the city's size. Social vulnerability was measured using the standard Human Development Index and the water and waste infrastructure data was taken from a global dataset published in 2022.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Rodrigo Duterte arrived at The Hague on Wednesday. In photos and videos, here's how he went from president of the Philippines to defendant before the ICC.

More than eight years after launching a blood-drenched war on drugs as president of the Philippines, elected on a platform that boiled down to shoot first and ask questions later, Rodrigo Duterte, 79, arrived in The Hague on Wednesday. He was arrested the day before under a warrant issued by the International Criminal Court, after years of taunting the international community to hold him accountable.

He landed in the Netherlands around 5 p.m. local time Wednesday, after a long flight from Manila that included a several-hour stopover in Dubai. His initial appearance as a suspect — during which the court confirms his identity and ensures he understands the charges and his rights — should take place within days of his arrival, ICC spokesperson Fadi El Abdallah said.

It was a moment of reckoning for the Philippines, where thousands were killed in a sweeping crackdown under Duterte's rule.

Duterte's push to stamp out drugs nationally began immediately after his 2016 election victory — under a promise to continue with the approach that he used to make a name for himself in seven terms as the mayor of Davao City on the southern island of Mindanao, the country's third-most-populous city.

“Forget the laws on human rights. If I make it to the presidential palace, I will do just what I did as mayor,” he said at his final campaign rally. “You drug pushers, holdup men and do-nothings, you better get out because I'll kill you.”

“I'll dump all of you into Manila Bay and fatten all the fish there.”

He soon made good on his word.

Summary executions left victims on the street with bound limbs and taped faces, next to cardboard signs reading: “I am a drug addict.” Others were dumped in the water, sometimes loaded down with concrete.

For years, Duterte encouraged the killings in explicit terms, while denying direct state links and pointing instead to “vigilante killers” and gangland justice out of his control.

Many killings happened in murky police encounters: drug users shot in the back of the head, drug packets seemingly planted at crime scenes, the same guns found on different victims, according to reports from rights groups including Human Rights Watch. Police reports often alleged self-defense, using the Filipino stock phrase “nanlaban,” or “they fought back.”

Even as calls grew to investigate accusations of systematic, state-sanctioned killings by police, Duterte remained popular. A national survey in 2019 found that around 80 percent of Filipinos polled were “satisfied” with the administration's campaign.

The Philippine government in June 2022 reported that at least 6,252 people had died “during antidrug operations” since July 2016.

Some rights groups have said as many as 30,000 people died in the war on drugs.

Victims' families have been left for years without justice or satisfying answers.

For years, Duterte seemed to enjoy the same impunity that he appeared to extend to those who carried out killings during the drug war.

The ICC is responsible for trying individuals charged with some of the most serious crimes under international law, including genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Many such charges are largely symbolic, as the ICC does not try people in absentia. If tried, Duterte would join a small list of less than two dozen people who have been held in the ICC detention center and appeared before the court. His lawyers have demanded his return to the Philippines.

The ICC's Abdallah said that after the suspect's initial appearance, the court sets a date to begin a confirmation-of-charges hearing, at which the prosecution must present “sufficient” evidence for the case to go to trial. The suspect's defense lawyer can also present evidence. In a previous 2022 case, the confirmation-of-charges hearing came eight months after a suspect's arrival in The Hague.

Duterte has often railed against international law and compared himself to its opponents.

“Hitler massacred 3 million Jews. Now, there is 3 million drug addicts. … I'd be happy to slaughter them,” he said in public remarks in 2016. (More than 6 million Jewish people were killed in the Holocaust.)

As international scrutiny increased and cases began piling up, Duterte dared the international community to arrest him. He mocked the concept of human rights.

“Your concern is human rights, mine is human lives,” he said in his 2018 State of the Nation address, meaning lives lost to drug addiction.

Before a regional summit in September 2016, he said: “The campaign against drugs will continue. … Plenty will be killed until the last pusher is out of the streets. … And I don't give a s--- about anybody observing my behavior.”

He warned that “nobody has the right to lecture” him about human rights and extrajudicial killings.

“I am the president of a sovereign state. And we have long ceased to be a colony. I do not have any master except the Filipino people,” he said. He was expected to meet with then-President Barack Obama, who called the meeting off after Duterte in that briefing used a Tagalog expression literally meaning “son of a whore” in threatening to curse Obama if he raised the subject of extrajudicial killings.

The ICC began investigating Duterte in 2018, and three years later it formally authorized an investigation on accusations of extrajudicial killings amounting to a crime against humanity.

All the while, even up until his arrest, Duterte continued to dare the international community to act.

He repeatedly said he was willing to “rot in jail” to rid the Philippines of drugs.

Addressing the United Nations, United States and European Union directly in a 2016 speech, he taunted: “Come here, investigate me. … I will play with you in public.”

In December 2020, he said that “all addicts have guns. If there's even a hint of wrongdoing, any overt act, even if you don't see a gun, just go ahead and shoot him.”

“Human rights, you are preoccupied with the lives of the criminals and drug pushers,” he continued, the Philippine Star newspaper reported. “The game is killing. … I say to the human rights, I don't give a s--- with you. My order is still the same.”

After Iceland led a U.N. resolution calling for an investigation of Duterte's drug war in 2019, Duterte went on a rambling rant decrying the country's abundance of ice.

“Iceland. That's your problem. You have too much ice, and there is no clear day or night there,” he said. “So you can understand no crime. There is no policeman, either, and they just go about eating ice.”

“Please don't f--- with me. I will really kill you,” he said. “So what's wrong? I am asking the human rights people. Is it wrong to say if you destroy my country I will kill you? Is that a crime for a president, mayor or a governor to say that in public?”

At a Philippine congressional hearing in November, Duterte said, “I'm asking the ICC to hurry up,” noting that the issue has been left hanging. “And if I am found guilty, I will go to prison and rot there for all time.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Duterte is accused of presiding over thousands of extrajudicial killings during his war on drugs. He was arrested in Manila and “forcibly” taken to The Hague, his daughter said.

Rodrigo Duterte, the former Philippine president who has been accused of crimes against humanity and the extrajudicial killings of thousands of people during his “war on drugs,” was arrested Tuesday in Manila under a warrant issued by the International Criminal Court, the government reported.

Duterte is on the way to The Hague, where the ICC is headquartered, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said in a late-night news briefing.

Duterte, 79, was detained by Philippine police shortly after flying into the country from Hong Kong at about 9:20 a.m. Video showed him walking with a cane and accompanied by officials inside Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila.

“What is the law and what is the crime that I committed?” he said in a separate video posted to Instagram by his daughter Veronica Duterte. “Show to me now the legal basis for my being here.”

Duterte's other daughter, Sara Duterte, who is vice president of the Philippines, said in a statement Tuesday night that her father was being “forcibly taken to The Hague.” Unverified footage from a retired Philippine general that was published Tuesday night and shared widely by local media showed the elder Duterte boarding a chartered jet.

Hours before he arrived, Interpol Manila received an official copy of the ICC warrant, prompting the Justice Department to serve it, Marcos Jr. said. “Interpol asked for help and we obliged, because we have commitments,” he said.

ICC spokesperson Fadi El Abdallah confirmed that the court's pretrial chamber issued an arrest warrant for “the crime of murder as a crime against humanity allegedly committed in the Philippines” between November 2011 and March 2019. Abdallah said that once a suspect is in ICC custody, the court schedules an initial appearance hearing.

Also Tuesday, the Philippine National Police deployed extra personnel to the Ninoy Aquino International Airport and, in a statement, warned against the spread of misinformation, advising the “public to rely only on official government sources for accurate information.”

While in Hong Kong this week, Duterte said he would accept his arrest and portrayed his actions as a way to bring peace to the Philippines, according to Reuters.

But his allies and family condemned his arrest Tuesday. “Today, our own government has surrendered a Filipino citizen — even a former President at that — to foreign powers,” Sara Duterte said. She called the arrest a “blatant affront to our sovereignty,” as well as “oppression and persecution.”

Salvador Panelo, Duterte's former chief legal counsel and presidential spokesman, called the arrest “unlawful.” The ICC has “no jurisdiction in the Philippines,” he said in a statement on social media.

Duterte, a former lawyer turned populist leader, was president between 2016 and 2022, a period in which he advocated for executing alleged criminals and is alleged to have overseen the killings of thousands of people in what authorities portrayed as drug-related cases.

On the campaign trail and in office, Duterte styled himself as a strongman who would prevent the Philippines from further cascading into a purported narco state. In 2016, he said he would be “happy to slaughter” drug addicts for the sake of his country, drawing a comparison to Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler.

It's unclear how many people were killed during Duterte's war on drugs, but Human Rights Watch estimated in 2018 that about 12,000 Filipinos had died since he took office less than two years before. The group attributed at least 2,555 killings directly to the Philippine National Police. Some estimates put the number at as many as 20,000 to 30,000 victims during the six-year war on drugs.

In June 2022, the country's government reported that at least 6,252 people had died “during antidrug operations” since July 2016.

Duterte's war on drugs drew fierce condemnation from human rights groups, world leaders and several U.N. agencies. A case against Duterte was filed in the International Criminal Court in 2018, alleging mass murder and crimes against humanity. He repeatedly denied the charges and responded by vowing to withdraw the Philippines from the ICC, a promise he carried out in 2019. The ICC formally authorized an investigation in 2021 into his drug crackdown.

The ICC is responsible for investigating and trying those charged with some of the most serious crimes, including genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and crimes of aggression.

It has issued arrest warrants in recent years for high-ranking officials accused of crimes during the Ukraine and Gaza wars, including Russian President Vladimir Putin; Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu; Israel's former defense minister Yoav Gallant; and Hamas leader Mohammed Deif, whom Israel's military said was killed in a strike in July. Those warrants were largely symbolic, as the ICC does not try people in absentia, and neither Russia, Israel nor the United States is a member of the court. So far, the court has issued 60 arrest warrants. Twenty-one people have been detained in the ICC's detention center and have appeared before the court.

The ICC does not have a police force and depends on its 125 member states to carry out arrest warrants, although there have been instances of members ignoring the warrants.

The Philippine government previously indicated it would comply with requests from Interpol — through which the ICC can issue arrest warrants — including those related to the ICC investigation.

However, last year, Marcos Jr. — Duterte's successor and the son of a disgraced Philippine dictator — said the government “will not lift a finger to help any investigation that the ICC conducts,” claiming it has no jurisdiction over the country.

Although Duterte withdrew the Philippines from the court's statute in 2019, the ICC argues that the court “retains jurisdiction” for alleged crimes that took place while the country was still a member.

The arrest comes amid a schism between the Marcos and Duterte political dynasties. Marcos Jr. and  Sara Duterte ran on a joint ticket, dubbing themselves the “UniTeam” in the 2022 elections, and their association was thought to be a strong source of political cover for the former president.

But the alliance has come apart: After political disagreements, hostilities between the president and vice president reached a tipping point in November, when Sara Duterte claimed in an online news conference that she had contracted someone to kill president Marcos Jr. if she were ever assassinated. In early February, Sara Duterte was impeached by the country's House of Representatives over that threat and corruption allegations. She faces a Senate trial.

In his news briefing after Duterte's Tuesday arrest, Marcos Jr. said he was confident that the arrest was “proper and correct.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

The resumption of U.S. military and intelligence aid for Ukraine follows a contentious White House meeting between the American and Ukrainian leaders, but Moscow is unlikely to agree to the proposed ceasefire.

KYIV — The resumption of U.S. aid and intelligence sharing following peace talks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, has reignited hope in Kyiv that Washington is willing to be a partner in ending the war with Moscow, even as resistance to a ceasefire mounted in Russia and the Kremlin declined to immediately endorse the proposal.

Pro-Kremlin Russian analysts, politicians and nationalist military bloggers said Russia would probably reject the ceasefire as a trap that would harm Russian interests and benefit Ukraine.

President Donald Trump said Wednesday that envoys were headed to Moscow with the proposal. “It's up to Russia now,” he said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky — whom the Trump administration had accused of being unready for peace after last month's contentious White House visit — described the meeting in a news conference Wednesday as “positive” and “constructive” and said it gave Ukraine a chance to signal to the United States its willingness for peace.

“We're not planning on playing with the narrative that ‘we don't want to end the war' that Russia is spreading all over the world. For me, it's important to end the war,” he said. “I want the president of the U.S. to see this, for Americans to see this and to feel this.”

He said that discussions included talk of returning prisoners and children and that the ceasefire would be a chance to work on a more comprehensive peace deal. Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022.

The agreement would temporarily freeze more than 1,800 miles of front lines in their current position — where Russian forces appear to hold the upper hand.

President Vladimir Putin has consistently stated that a temporary ceasefire would be unacceptable to Moscow. On Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said only that Russia would not be “getting ahead of ourselves” and would scrutinize the ceasefire proposal and review the joint statement.

The bilateral talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday between Washington and Kyiv marked an improvement in the relationship between Ukraine and its most important backer, which had chilled in the aftermath of the disastrous Oval Office meeting. In a joint statement, the United States and Kyiv vowed to “immediately begin negotiations toward an enduring peace that provides for Ukraine's long-term security.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who led the talks in Jeddah, said Wednesday: “We all eagerly await the Russian response, and we urge them strongly to consider ending all hostilities.”

He said if Russia answered positively, “then we know we've made real progress, and there's a real chance of peace. If their response is no, it would be highly unfortunate, and it'll make their intentions clear.”

“The ball is truly in their court,” Rubio added, as he traveled to a meeting of Group of Seven foreign ministers in Quebec.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina), a close ally of Trump, said that Zelensky had proved support for peace and that he was skeptical that Russia would accept the ceasefire.

“It is now up to Putin to show his cards. In order to move toward peace, I will be introducing bone-breaking sanctions and tariffs against Russia before the end of the week. If they do not pursue the ceasefire with the same vigor as Ukraine, there will be hell to pay,” he posted on X.

Putin ruled out a truce or temporary ceasefire in July, while insisting that “Russia stands for a complete and final end to the conflict,” which according to his conditions for peace would involve Ukraine's demilitarization, neutrality and surrender of large chunks of territory. He maintained that a “truce or temporary ceasefire, or some kind of pause” would be used by Kyiv “to recover losses, regroup and rearm.”

Russian politicians, nationalists and military bloggers have expressed their opposition to a ceasefire. Even before the proposal was announced, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov spoke against it on Tuesday.

Russian far-right ideologue Alexander Dugin, whose revanchist ideas are believed to influence Putin, said that Moscow would certainly reject the ceasefire proposal. He argued Wednesday on X that it would be contrary to what he sees as Trump's ideology of a world in which great powers carve up the globe into spheres of influence.

“The present stand on ceasefire is inconsistent in face of the Great Powers World Order he himself advocates,” Dugin wrote, referring to Trump. “Knowing that a Russian answer to so-called ‘ceasefire' will be decisive NO, warmongers from the International Deep State repeat this mantra that ‘the ball is on Russia's side.' That serves to justify the war. Another tricky trap for MAGA. Think better,” he wrote in another post.

In Kyiv, however, the atmosphere Tuesday was cautiously jubilant, despite air sirens echoing in the night — probably in retaliation for Ukraine's massive drone attack on Moscow earlier in the week. In the city's historic Independence Square, known as the Maidan, a few people walked past a makeshift memorial to fallen soldiers, some stopping to pay their respects. Sisters-in-law Karina and Oksana Harei wrote messages on small Ukrainian flags to add to the thousands speared in the damp spring soil.

“We are writing the names of our defenders,” Karina said. “Our friends, just people we know who defended us.” The war had been terrible, with too many people dying — including children — and she hoped it would end soon.

Nearby, Daryna Smilyanets also stopped in the square. “I'm trying to hold on, to believe in the best,” she said. “I want all this to be worthwhile and for it to end, for everyone to return, for those who are in captivity, for those who are fighting, for everyone to come home alive.”

Russian attacks on Ukraine continued overnight, killing five people — four in Odessa and one in Kryvyi Rih.

There has also been fierce fighting in Russia's Kursk region, where Ukraine has been holding a steadily diminishing sliver of land that it hoped to use as a bargaining chip in negotiations. Russian state agencies posted a video of a Russian flag in Sudzha's city center, an indication that the town might have fallen.

The Ukrainian military declined to answer questions about the situation in Sudzha, but in his briefing, Zelensky said the military in Kursk is “executing its tasks; the Russians are trying to push out our military as much as possible.”

On Tuesday, the deputy commander of a Ukrainian brigade that has been fighting in the Kursk region since January said the situation has rapidly deteriorated, that the Russians have “massed their forces very seriously” along the front line and “memorized all of our logistical routes.” The commander, who declined to provide his name or call signal because of security concerns, said it has become impossible for troops “to drive in or out from the territory of Kursk oblast to the territory of Ukraine” to resupply.

“Honestly,” he said, “slowly and slowly they pushed us to the point that we couldn't put up a fight there any longer.” It was unclear, however, how many Ukrainian troops remain in the enclave.

Russia's successes there and slow advances elsewhere along the front are why Moscow should not agree to the proposed ceasefire, said Sen. Konstantin Kosachyov, deputy speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament.

“Russia is on the offensive, so things will be different with Russia. Any agreements, with understanding for the need for compromises, will be reached on our terms, not American. This is not boasting, but an understanding that real agreements are still being written there, at the front. Washington also needs to realize that,” he wrote on Telegram.

Konstantin Malofeev, a conservative tycoon with ties to the Kremlin, claimed on Telegram that Russian fighters had “unfurled the Imperial flag in the center of Sudzha.”

“They unfurled it calmly, confidently, in the middle of the square. That's all you need to know about ‘30-day truces,' ‘freezing the conflict,' ‘NATO peacekeeping forces.' Only Russia can end the war and only on its own terms,” he wrote.

In Kyiv, though, the troubles on the front were largely eclipsed by the outcome of the Jeddah meeting, which “exceeded the most optimistic expectations,” Ukrainian political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko wrote on Facebook, positing that Trump was aiming for a ceasefire by Easter. The question, he said, was how the Kremlin would respond.

“For Putin, there is a difficult dilemma — Ukraine or Trump,” Fesenko said. “Just yesterday, he must have hoped to get both, with Trump's help to bend Ukraine to surrender, eventually restore control of Ukraine, and in parallel agree with Trump on various tactical and possibly strategic issues. And now he will have to choose.”

The president says the United States needs to “get” Greenland “one way or the other.” The territory has banned political contributions from overseas.

Greenlanders went to the polls on Tuesday to elect a new government — before a world that's taking unusual notice.

In the past, few outsiders would care much how the semiautonomous territory of the kingdom of Denmark voted. But these are different times. Now there's intense, global focus on the Arctic region, with China, Russia and the United States all seeking more control of this new melting world.

In a surprise result, the opposition Demokraatit party won the most votes, according to the official tally. With around 30 percent of the ballot, the pro-business party came in ahead of the incumbents — democratic socialist party Inuit Ataqatigiit and its coalition partner, the social democratic Siumut party — which had been expected to win enough votes to remain in leadership.

Demokraatit — which favors a moderate pace of independence from Denmark, according to the Associated Press — held three of the 31 parliamentary seats before this week's vote.

Party leader Jens Frederik Nielsen received more than 4,400 personal votes, the highest number for a single candidate in this election, according to the state broadcaster.

President Donald Trump told Congress last week that “one way or the other,” the United States needed to “get” Greenland. A new treaty? The 52nd state, after the United States snags Canada? Trump has not elaborated. (He's made similar claims for the Panama Canal and Gaza.)","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

The ruling also said the State Department and USAID would have to spend $58 million appropriated by Congress at some point.

A U.S. district judge has ruled that the Trump administration must quickly pay nearly $2 billion in foreign assistance owed to its humanitarian partners around the world, saying the administration probably violated the Constitution by blocking money allocated by Congress.

U.S. District Judge Amir H. Ali gave the Trump administration until Friday to provide a status report on payment of thousands of invoices owed to relief groups for work performed before Feb. 13.

But Ali also found that the State Department's review and termination of thousands of contracts with aid groups for work after that date could stand. He said the government would have to spend $58 billion in foreign aid appropriated by Congress at some point, but could legally cancel most of its U.S. Agency for International Development and State Department contracts for future assistance as part of a plan to radically reduce foreign aid.

Countries around the globe have relied on that funding for decades for food, medicine, vaccines and more. Aid groups warn the cuts will result in humanitarian disasters.

In his ruling late Monday, Ali, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, offered a forceful rebuke of President Donald Trump's sweeping and controversial assertion that he has the power to determine whether funds allocated by Congress are spent.

“The Executive not only claims his constitutional authority to determine how to spend appropriated funds, but usurps Congress's exclusive authority to dictate whether the funds should be spent in the first place,” Ali wrote. “In advancing this position, Defendants offer an unbridled view of Executive power that the Supreme Court has consistently rejected — a view that flouts multiple statutes whose constitutionality is not in question.”

It is the third time he has ordered payment for work completed by mid-February. The government had made some progress in paying for the work but had not substantially complied with a Monday deadline to release hundreds of millions in payments, according to an attorney working on the case who was not authorized to speak on the record.

Ali's ruling made clear that he could not dictate how the Trump administration spends congressionally allocated funds going forward. In recent days, the State Department canceled about 9,900 of 13,100 USAID and State Department grants, according to Ali's ruling.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Monday in a post on X that the agency had done a six-week analysis and was officially canceling “83% of the programs at USAID” — 5,200 contracts that “spent tens of billions of dollars in ways that did not serve, (and in some cases even harmed), the core national interests of the United States.”

Two global health groups that sued the government had asked Ali to find that it was implausible that officials could meaningfully review so many contracts so quickly. They accused the Trump administration of using the review as a pretext to carry out a policy initiative — the canceling of foreign aid — that had been blocked by the courts. Ali found the plaintiffs hadn't proved that contention but didn't make a ruling on it.

“The Court finds Plaintiffs have not made an adequate showing that the large-scale terminations resulted from the same agency action they challenge in their complaints,” he wrote.

The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday, but the global health groups — the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and the Global Health Council — called the ruling a partial victory.

“Today's decision affirms a basic principle of our Constitution: the president is not a king,” Lauren Bateman, an attorney with Public Citizen who is representing the plaintiffs, said in a statement. “But we are painfully aware that, without unwinding the mass termination of foreign assistance awards, winning on the constitutional issues does not avert the humanitarian disaster caused by the Trump Administration's freeze on foreign assistance.”

The health groups and other partners had sued the Trump administration after the president issued his pause on foreign aid shortly after his inauguration, touching off a heated legal battle.

Ali quickly issued a temporary restraining order requiring all the funding to be restarted. The aid groups accused the administration of flouting that order, and Ali eventually set a Feb. 26 deadline to restart some of the payments.

The administration asked the Supreme Court to block the deadline. In a sharply divided decision last week, a majority found that Ali could enforce his order.

As is customary in emergency orders, the majority did not detail its reasoning. But the dissent from four of the court's conservatives was furious.

“Does a single district-court judge who likely lacks jurisdiction have the unchecked power to compel the Government of the United States to pay out (and probably lose forever) 2 billion taxpayer dollars? The answer to that question should be an emphatic ‘No,' but a majority of this Court apparently thinks otherwise. I am stunned,” wrote Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh.

Lawyers for the government told Ali on Thursday that health organizations had been paid $70 million overnight. But the USAID payment system has been largely offline for weeks, according to the groups' lawsuit, after associates of Trump adviser Elon Musk allegedly ordered widespread staff cuts.

Without the funds they were expecting, aid groups' work has ground to a halt in places such as Ethiopia and Sudan, with medicine and food stranded in warehouses. A USAID official was fired after he found that the cuts would create a humanitarian catastrophe, leading to large increases in malaria and a lack of treatment for pregnant women, among other issues.

Ali wrote in his Monday order that the freeze had caused “immense irreparable harm to businesses and organizations across the country, which has, at least to date, gone unrebutted by Defendants.”

Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which is tasked with confirming the president's nominees to fill the top positions in the State Department, are pushing to stall the process to fill key roles unless Rubio agrees to testify about the administration's cancellation of U.S. foreign assistance programs.

“We should not confirm any additional nominees for State Department positions until Secretary Rubio appears before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and fully explains the dismantling of USAID, the firing of dedicated public servants, and the unilateral cancellation of contracts without the consultation with Congress,” Democratic Sens. Chris Murphy (Connecticut), Chris Van Hollen (Maryland) and Jeff Merkley (Oregon) wrote Monday in a letter to the committee's leadership.

The committee's chairman, Sen. James E. Risch (R-Idaho), appeared to agree to delay Tuesday's planned committee meeting, after the Democrats requested a “holdover” on “business as usual” until Rubio testifies.

Jenny Breen, an associate professor of law at Syracuse University, said Ali's ruling was notable for its pushback on Trump's assertion of broad power over funding decisions.

“The opinion forcefully rejects the government's assertions of unconstrained executive power by reminding it of Congress's constitutionally mandated lead role in spending and partnership role in foreign affairs,” Breen said.

The agreement followed an expansive meeting in Saudi Arabia. It is unclear whether Moscow will accept the ceasefire terms.

JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia — The Trump administration lifted its pause on military and intelligence support for Ukraine on Tuesday after Kyiv endorsed an ambitious U.S. ceasefire proposal aimed at initiating an end to the three-year war.

The agreement, resulting from more than eight hours of meetings between U.S. and Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia, dramatically improves Kyiv's war footing and lessens a transatlantic divide between U.S. and European allies that had plunged to new lows.

“The Ukrainian delegation today made something very clear, that they share President Trump's vision for peace, they share his determination to end the fighting, to end the killing, to end the tragic meat grinder of people,” White House national security adviser Michael Waltz said after the meetings.

The mere fact that U.S. and Ukrainian officials were able to agree on a joint statement, much less one of substance, marked a significant improvement in relations after the row between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office and the abrupt suspension of U.S. support for Kyiv.

Ukrainian officials came to the meeting offering a limited ceasefire that would ban Kyiv and Moscow from launching aerial and sea-based long-range attacks. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who led the talks, made clear that the U.S. proposal for a 30-day ceasefire governed the entire conflict, including the front lines, where the vast majority of fatalities have occurred.

“You have to stop shooting at each other, and that's what the president has wanted to see, and that's the commitment we got today from the Ukrainian side,” Rubio said.

“We'll take this offer now to the Russians. We hope the Russians will reciprocate,” Rubio added.

It is far from clear whether Moscow will accept the proposal, but analysts called the agreement a savvy move by Zelensky, whose position of strength had been greatly diminished by the public chasm between Ukraine and its most powerful backer, the United States.

“It effectively puts the onus on Russia to accept an arrangement they otherwise would have rejected out of hand or risk Trump's ire,” said Sam Charap, a senior political scientist at Rand, a think tank.

Once implemented, the ceasefire can be extended “by mutual agreement of the parties,” said the joint statement issued by Ukraine and the United States.

The statement also said the two countries agreed to conclude as soon as possible a “comprehensive agreement for developing Ukraine's critical mineral resources to expand Ukraine's economy and guarantee Ukraine's long-term prosperity and security.”

Absent from the statement is the type of security guarantee Ukrainians say is necessary to deter Russia from invading following a cessation of hostilities.

The Trump administration has ruled out allowing Ukraine into NATO, viewing that as placing new burdens on the United States and obviating a path to peace with Moscow.

The agreement Tuesday was immediately praised by U.S. allies in Europe, including the leaders of the European Commission and the European Council.

“This is a positive development that can be a step towards a comprehensive, just and lasting peace for Ukraine,” the leaders said in a joint statement. “The ball is now in Russia's court.”

Many challenges to concluding a deal remain, as evidenced by the uptick in fighting between the two sides.

Hours after the joint statement was released, Ukrainian officials reported strikes. In posts on Telegram early Wednesday local time, municipal officials in Kyiv urged residents to seek shelter as air raid sirens sounded, while the head of the Dnipropetrovsk regional military administration, Serhiy Lysak, said Russian drones had damaged 10 homes in the area.

Russian authorities said Ukraine targeted Moscow and other cities with a massive drone attack Tuesday, killing three people. Russia's Defense Ministry claimed to have shot down 343  Ukrainian drones over Russian regions. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said it was the largest drone attack on the city during the war.

The attack came days after intensive Russian missile and drone strikes that killed 20 Ukrainians and injured dozens more.

Elsewhere on the battlefield, Russia's Defense Ministry claimed to have retaken more than 38 square miles from Ukrainian forces in Kursk, in southwestern Russia, an area seized by Kyiv in August as a possible bargaining chip in any peace talks.

A critically important aspect of Tuesday's agreement is the resumption of weapons deliveries to Ukraine. The United States had stopped the transfer of any of the $3.85 billion in remaining military equipment available for Ukraine and halted delivery of weapons already in transit that had been approved by the Biden administration. Waltz said that aid will now “proceed to the Ukrainians.”

Also crucial to the deal is the perception that the United States still backs Ukraine after Trump and Vice President JD Vance derided Zelensky as an obstacle to peace.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha hailed the agreement as a “step that proves Ukraine is ready to move forward on the path to a just end to the war. Ukraine is not an obstacle to peace; it is a partner in its restoration.”

Charap, at Rand, said the agreement “goes a long way toward repairing the U.S.-Ukraine relationship given that Kyiv and Washington are now on the same page on the war.”

The Trump administration's 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are now in effect but South Korea, Japan and Australia remain hopeful of exemptions.

SEOUL — Washington's closest security allies in the Asia-Pacific region are still holding out hope for exemptions to President Donald Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which went into effect Wednesday.

The tariffs kicked in as Seoul, Tokyo and Canberra — three of the allied governments friendliest to the United States — grapple with Trump's more combative second-term approach to trade and his shifting positions on alliances.

“Friends need to act in a way that reinforces, to our respective populations, the fact that we are friends,” Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Wednesday. “This is not a friendly act.”

The United States imposed 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, with Trump saying the duties are critical for promoting greater domestic steel industry production and employment, and “making America rich again.”

Trump's anger has so far been aimed at Canada, the biggest supplier of steel and aluminum to the United States. Trump even threatened to hike the tariffs on Canada to 50 percent — although he backtracked on that Tuesday, keeping them at 25 percent.

But his approach has also alarmed policymakers and industry leaders in South Korea, Japan and Australia, all of whom had been granted carve-outs from the tariffs in 2018, during Trump's first term in office. Trump has vowed that this time around, there will be no exclusions or exemptions for any country, no matter how friendly.

“The arrow of the Trump's ‘America First' policy has begun to zero in on South Korea,” Choi Sang-mok, the nation's acting president, said on Tuesday.

South Korea is among the top five importers of steel and aluminum to the United States, selling it $4.8 billion in steel and steel products in 2024, according to the Korea International Trade Association. It also exported $1 billion in aluminum products to the United States last year, according to the association.

During his address to Congress last week, Trump claimed that Seoul levies tariffs four times higher than those of the United States. But under a free-trade agreement, South Korea's effective tariff rate for goods imported from the United States was 0.79 percent in 2024, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said last week.

Still, the United States' trade deficit with South Korea has ballooned since the free-trade agreement went into effect in 2012, hitting $66 billion in 2024, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, and attracting repeated criticism from Trump.

Choi said he had directed officials to “actively explain” to Washington “misunderstandings” about the trade imbalance, adding this week that he hoped to work out a deal with the Trump administration.

But the nation's deep political crisis is hampering its ability to make a strong case, analysts say. South Korea's president and prime minister have both been impeached and suspended, and there may not be a permanent head of state until sometime in the summer.

“Because of the leadership vacuum, South Korea is not really in a position to move fast and try to get some sort of exemption,” said Yeo Han-koo, former trade minister who negotiated tariff carve-outs in the first Trump term.

While the tariffs pose a challenge to the domestic steel industry, it could also create opportunities for companies to become more nimble because South Korea's steel exports were previously capped under a quota system in exchange for the exemption, Yeo said.

Japan's efforts to secure a carve-out have also been unsuccessful.

Japanese Trade Minister Yoji Muto on Monday met with Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett in Washington to press Tokyo's case.

Muto told reporters after the meeting that he touted the fact that Japanese companies have invested heavily into the United States, and that these investments have helped create American jobs.

But in the end, he failed to win any assurances from the U.S. officials. “We agreed to continue close consultations with the U.S. government and to hold discussions at the working level as soon as possible,” Muto said Monday.

Japan exported $2 billion in steel products to the United States in 2024, according to its Finance Ministry. Its aluminum exports were far lower, at about $178 million.

Last week, Trump questioned the economic and security relationship between the two allies, calling the decades-old defense pact nonreciprocal and saying Japan makes “a fortune with us economically.”

Top Japanese officials, including Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, immediately rejected Trump's characterizations that Washington unilaterally protects Japan. Japan hosts U.S. bases and has ramped up its defense spending in recent years, which are both important to U.S. efforts to counter China and North Korea, officials said.

In Australia, which secured an exemption to similar levies in 2018, Albanese vowed to continue pressing his country's case, even as he expressed disappointment and almost befuddlement over the “entirely unjustified” tariffs.

“This is against the spirit of our two nations' enduring friendship, and fundamentally at odds with the benefits that our economic partnership has delivered over more than 70 years,” he said during a news conference in Sydney.

Australia sent about $500 million of aluminum and steel to the United States last year, according to its Department of Resources. That amounted to roughly 6 percent of its aluminum exports and 35 percent of its steel exports.

Albanese ruled out reciprocal tariffs, which he said would only hurt Australian consumers.

The two countries have had a free-trade agreement since 2005, and the United States has long had a trade surplus with Australia — something Australian officials have repeated in their quest for an exemption.

Albanese  said he does not consider the tariffs decision final, noting that it took months for Australia to secure an exemption to similar tariffs during Trump's first term.

“We will continue to engage constructively with the United States and to make the case for Australian trade and the benefits that it gives to people in the United States of America,” he said,

The tariffs nonetheless have ruffled feathers in Australia, which has deepened defense ties with the United States in recent years in response to China's growing military assertiveness. Just last month, Canberra made its first $500 million payment to Washington under the AUKUS nuclear submarine deal.

“The special friendship is over,” ran a headline in the Sydney Morning Herald. “Trump doesn't care about Australia.”

Former Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, who secured the tariff exemption from Trump in 2018, said the tariffs are part of a bigger U.S. shift that should ring alarm bells in Canberra.

“We can no longer say that our ally shares our values,” he said in an interview. “How do we pursue our national interests in an age where our principal ally believes that might is right and is no longer committed to the international rules based order?”

Hayley Channer from the United States Studies Centre, a Sydney think tank, cautioned against reading too much into the tariffs, but agreed Trump's actions were sparking broader fears.

“U. S. reliability and credibility is under question,” she said. “And the biggest fear in Australia is that Trump could seek to renegotiate Australia's financial contribution to AUKUS.”

The striking growth of China's shipbuilding industry — commercial and military — poses national security concerns for the United States, analysts say.

A single Chinese state-owned shipbuilder produced more commercial vessels by tonnage in 2024 than the entire U.S. shipbuilding industry has since World War II, according to a report that underscores how China has come to dominate the sector.

Foreign companies may be inadvertently fueling the expansion of the Chinese navy, according to the report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, posing a national security threat to the United States and its allies.

“China's shipbuilding sector has undergone a striking metamorphosis. Twenty years ago, the country was a peripheral player in the global shipyard business. Today, it dominates the industry,” the report said.

President Donald Trump has Chinese ship manufacturing in his crosshairs — his administration has proposed charging Chinese-built vessels up to $1.5 million in fees to dock at any U.S. port — as part of his pledge to resurrect American shipbuilding.

China has said it would “take necessary measures” to defend itself against any such fees. Imposing fees on Chinese ships “will ultimately fail to revitalize the U.S. shipbuilding industry,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said Monday.

The CSIS report illustrates the challenge: China has gone from producing less than 5 percent of the world's commercial ships in 2000 to accounting for more than half of global production last year. The United States, meanwhile, accounted for 0.1 percent, according to the think tank's analysis.

China's emergence as a shipbuilding giant began in the early 2000s with aggressive state support. The industry has become even more important under Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who aims to turn his country into a maritime power to rival the United States. The Chinese navy — officially known as the People's Liberation Army Navy, or PLAN — is now the world's largest, overtaking the U.S. Navy in its number of warships.

The China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) — the largest such group in the world, which is directly overseen by China's top political and military leadership — is at the center of those ambitions.

The state-owned firm is a major defense contractor that supplies the Chinese military but also has commercial operations — just as American companies such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin have both commercial and military divisions.

But in China, the line between the CSSC's commercial and military operations is deliberately blurred as part of Xi's national strategy to leverage the private sector to boost the military.

Container ships, bulk carriers and other commercial vessels ordered by customers in Europe and elsewhere in Asia are built in dual-use shipyards that also make aircraft carriers, nuclear-powered submarines and surface combatants, according to CSIS's analysis of satellite imagery.

The report found that more than 75 percent of ships produced at the CSSC shipyards with the closest ties to the military were destined for foreign firms, including those in countries with close security relationships with the United States, among them Denmark, France, Greece, Japan, Singapore and South Korea.

“By purchasing vessels from these yards, foreign firms have funneled billions of dollars of revenue into entities that are central to China's naval modernization,” the report concluded.

These dual-use shipyards are helping China scale up the PLAN. A CSIS analysis last year found that China's navy commanded 234 warships compared with the U.S. naval fleet of 219.

The PLAN's fleet is on track to reach 425 ships by 2030, “sustained by an industrial base capable of replacing and repairing vessels far faster than U.S. yards,” the report concluded.

The close links between China's commercial and military sectors have helped turn the country into a giant in the industry. While shipyards in South Korea, Japan and the United States have had to shutter during economic downturns, Chinese shipbuilders were sustained by orders from the Chinese navy as well as through state subsidies.

South Korea and Japan, the world's second- and third-largest ship producers, have quickly lost market share. European companies also face growing competition as China starts to make cruise ships.

Between 2019 and 2023, four CSSC-owned shipyards — from Dalian in the north to Guangzhou in the south — launched at least 39 warships, a fleet greater in tonnage than Britain's entire Royal Navy.

Over the same period, those shipyards produced 19 million gross tons of commercial vessels, the report found. That's almost the total annual output of South Korea's entire shipbuilding industry.

According to Matthew Funaiole, one of the authors of the report, that means foreign firms are probably inadvertently offsetting the costs of expanding and modernizing the facilities that aid China's military expansion.

“They are buying ships from China because China makes most of the ships in the world. It makes them quickly, and it makes them well,” he said. “When you are buying a ship from a shipyard in China, you don't know what the profit is on the Chinese side and how those profits might be getting used to augment or subsidize military production.”

One particularly striking example involves Taiwan, the self-governing democracy that Beijing considers a breakaway province and that Xi has pledged to “reunify” with China — even though the island has never been ruled by the Chinese Communist Party.

The Taiwanese shipping company Evergreen Marine Corp. has placed several orders with the CSSC.

CSIS calculated that 15 percent of the company's current fleet was built at the same Chinese shipyards that produce warships specifically designed to assist an assault across the Taiwan Strait.

“The symbolism of Evergreen's distinctive green hulls built just beside the PLAN's Fujian aircraft carrier — named for the province from which China would launch an invasion of Taiwan — is eye-catching,” the report said.

Evergreen did not respond to request for comment.

In response to questions about whether China's dual-use shipyards contributed to its dominance in the sector, China's Foreign Ministry said the shipbuilding industry's development was “the result of technological innovation and active participation in market competition.”

“China has always been a builder of world peace,” it said.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

As President Donald Trump's global steel and aluminum tariffs take effect, the E.U. and Canada are responding with their own levies, including on bourbon and motorcycles.

BRUSSELS — The European Union and Canada hit back Wednesday at President Donald Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs with their own levies, announcing tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of U.S. products, including bourbon and motorcycles, while warning of further retaliation.

The 27-nation E.U. said its two-stage response would target roughly $28 billion in U.S. exports, while Canada announced 25 percent retaliatory tariffs on roughly $20.7 billion ($29.8 billion Canadian dollars) worth of American goods.

The announcement of the European measures came at the same time that Trump's tariffs took effect Wednesday. Canada's announcement came several hours later Wednesday morning.

The U.S. decision to raise tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25 percent is the latest salvo in Trump's campaign to reshape America's trading relationship with the world. European leaders have for months planned to swiftly retaliate, even as they have emphasized that a trade war would hurt both sides and tried to negotiate an off-ramp with the Trump administration.

With a deal still elusive, the E.U. executive branch, the European Commission, said that starting April 1, the bloc will reimpose tariffs dating to Trump's first term. It will then place extra measures targeting more than $19 billion in products by mid-April after consulting with E.U. member states.

“We deeply regret this measure,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement Wednesday, as she and other European officials indicated that they were still ready to negotiate. “Jobs are at stake, prices up, nobody needs that.”

Canadian Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc said the government is following a “dollar for dollar” approach in response to Trump's increased tariffs on steel and aluminum, which could cost Canada significant U.S. sales.

The Canadian tariffs, set to start at 12:01 a.m. Thursday, will hit steel products worth roughly $8.7 billion ($12.6 billion CAD), aluminum products worth $2.08 billion ($3 billion CAD) and $9.85 billion ($14.2 billion CAD) of additional U.S. imports.

LeBlanc said the U.S. tariffs were “inserting disruption and disorder” for consumers in both countries and unfairly targeting Canada's steel and aluminum industry.

During Trump's first term, the E.U. had raised tariffs on a variety of products in response to U.S. measures, which were suspended after negotiations with the Biden administration. The pause will now be allowed to expire April 1, with the higher E.U. levies reinstated.

In Trump's previous term, the E.U. chose tariffs designed for maximum political impact, targeting industries based in the home states of Republican leaders, including bourbon from Kentucky, the state represented by then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The bloc also targeted Harley-Davidson motorcycles and Levi's jeans.

The E.U. said the new U.S. tariffs — which affect products that contain steel and aluminum, such as cookware and window frames — would impact about $28 billion of the bloc's own exports, and that it intended to retaliate proportionately.

Along with reimposing the past tariffs, the E.U. said it would impose levies on more than $19 billion worth of other products. E.U. officials will consult for two weeks to finalize the list, with the aim of imposing the new tariffs by mid-April on proposed goods that included home appliances, beef and poultry.

“We're trying to hit the U.S. in important sectors for them, where it does not cost us much,” said a senior E.U. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to share internal deliberations. Another goal was to prompt American businesses to convey to the Trump administration that “this is a bad idea,” he said.

European leaders have long made clear that they would prefer to negotiate and persuade Trump to forgo tariffs. On Wednesday, officials suggested the new E.U. measures could spur an agreement.

E.U. Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic said Wednesday that disruption from tariffs was “avoidable if the U.S. administration accepts our extended hand and works with us to strike a deal.”

The tariffs come at a difficult time for economies in the E.U., which counts the United States as its largest export market. With key E.U. countries facing sluggish growth, businesses are bracing for the prospect of a protracted trade war. Germany, the leading exporter to the United States, would be particularly vulnerable, with some of the biggest anticipated effects on the car and pharmaceutical industries.

The E.U. has not been completely caught off guard, though. At E.U. headquarters, a group informally dubbed the “Trump task force” has been strategizing for Trump's return since last year and focusing on preparing for trade scenarios.

But E.U. officials have faced difficulties arranging meetings with some of their U.S. counterparts or determining whom to lobby in the administration, given uncertainty about how U.S. decisions are made, diplomats say.

Sefcovic, who recently visited Washington, said this week that the Trump administration “did not seem to be engaging” on offers to negotiate a deal.

“We jointly identified the few areas that would allow us to move forward by fostering a mutual benefit,” Sefcovic told reporters in Brussels. “But in the end, one hand cannot clap.”

The tariffs have also disturbed U.S. trade relations with other countries.

In Brazil, officials reacted with anger at the news of the steel tariffs. The United States is the Brazilian steel sector's largest foreign market. Brazil's steel exports reached 3.4 million tons of slabs in 2024, according to the Brazil Steel Institute.

Speaking at a car factory in southeastern Brazil, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said he wouldn't be intimidated by Trump.

“It doesn't matter if Trump keeps yelling, because I've learned not to be frightened of an ugly face,” Lula said. “Speak calmly with me, speak with respect to me, because I've learned to respect others and want to be respected.”

But on Wednesday, Brazilian Finance Minister Fernando Haddad said his  country was not yet ready to retaliate with its own tariffs. Haddad said that the Brazilian steel sector does not compete with the American steel industry but collaborates with it and that Brazil will try to negotiate a way out of the impasse.

Haddad said Lula asked for officials to keep a cool head and not overreact.

The Pakistani government, facing a widening security crisis in the country's restive southwest, has given little indication it intends to negotiate with the militants.

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — A battle between separatist militants and Pakistani soldiers over a hijacked passenger train entered its second day on Wednesday, with dozens of people killed in clashes and an unknown number of passengers still believed to be held hostage by the militants.

Militants belonging to a Baluch separatist group, the Baluchistan Liberation Army, or BLA, stopped and boarded the train, the Jaffar Express, in a mountainous part of Baluchistan province on Tuesday. More than 350 people were believed to be onboard when the train was seized, including about 150 members of the security forces, Pakistani railway officials said.

The BLA initially claimed to have taken about 180 hostages, threatening to kill them if a rescue operation was attempted, while urging Pakistani officials to instead negotiate a prisoner exchange. The group gave the Pakistani government 48 hours to respond; the deadline expires about midday Thursday.

In a statement Wednesday, the group threatened that “with every passing hour after the ultimatum expires, five hostages will be punished” — a phrase widely understood to mean they would be executed. Local Pakistani officials confirmed the group had taken hostages but put their numbers in the low dozens.

After intense clashes overnight, Pakistani officials said Wednesday that 190 people had been freed and 30 militants killed but that the hostage situation remained unresolved.

The Pakistani government, facing a widening security crisis in the country's restive southwest, has taken a hard line and given little public indication it will negotiate. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said Tuesday that the “cowardly terrorists, who carried out this despicable attack, are not deserving of any leniency,” according to the Express Tribune.

Pakistani officials on Wednesday accused the militants of using women and children as human shields on the hijacked train — a claim that the group denied.

Mohammad Ashraf, a passenger who was released, said the militants allowed some of them to leave after separating him, other elderly people, and women and children from the remaining passengers. “It was so quiet — everyone was in fear,” he told Pakistani television crews.

The Jaffar Express left Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan, at about 9 a.m. and was expected to traverse much of Punjab province before arriving in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, more than 30 hours later. It was attacked roughly three to four hours into the trip. Some passengers may have taken the train because, after months of worsening security incidents along Baluchistan's highways, it was seen as the last safe method of transportation.

The train hijacking is a major blow to Pakistan's military and civilian leadership, which are struggling to realize their plans to integrate the volatile southwestern province into Pakistan's trade corridor with China. The deepwater Gwadar port in southern Baluchistan is a key component of that plan.

Militant attacks in that part of Pakistan surged by more than 80 percent last year, killing more than 320 people, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies. Most attacks have been claimed by the BLA and its ideological ally, the Baluchistan Liberation Front.

Their attacks have made parts of the province “ungovernable,” Pakistani security analyst Hasan Askari Rizvi said, adding that Tuesday's train hijacking signals “a grave security challenge for Pakistan.”

Dozens of people were killed in a BLA suicide attack at a Quetta railway station in November, which targeted a group of soldiers.

There are also Baluch communities in neighboring Iran and Afghanistan, and Pakistani officials have frequently accused the BLA and other groups of exploiting porous borders to evade capture and sustain their insurgency.

Analysts warn that Baluchistan's militancy is at least in part fueled by broader and more widely felt grievances over rampant poverty and neglect. The government and its foreign partners are seen by separatists as exploiting the region's vast natural resources with little benefit to local communities.

“A large share of Baluchistan's youths feel alienated, marginalized and excluded from their fair share of the province's economic development,” Rizvi said. “There should be a dialogue to win these people back.”

The BLA has claimed at least 10 attacks on Chinese targets since 2017, including a blast in Karachi in October that killed two Chinese workers.

Baluch militants have also targeted ethnic Punjabi civilians, whom they view as complicit in the government's plans for the region. Officials documented at least 15 attacks against non-Baluch workers, travelers or settlers last year.

Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has been turned over to the custody of the International Criminal Court

THE HAGUE, Netherlands — Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was turned over Wednesday to the custody of the International Criminal Court, following his arrest on a warrant accusing him of crimes against humanity over deadly anti-drugs crackdowns he oversaw while in office.

The 79-year-old former president arrived at Rotterdam The Hague Airport in the Netherlands earlier Wednesday on a flight from Manila, following his arrest there on an ICC request on Tuesday.

Rights groups and families of victims hailed Duterte's arrest, and the court's chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, called it “a crucial step in our continuous work to ensure accountability for the victims of the most serious crimes under ICC jurisdiction.”

Supporters of Duterte criticized the administration of current Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, Duterte's political rival, for arresting and surrendering the former leader to a court whose jurisdiction his supporters dispute.

The Dutch-based court said in a statement that medical assistance was made available ‘'as a precautionary measure'' at the airport for Duterte, in line with standard procedures when a suspect arrives. The court did not comment on his state of health.

An ambulance drove to the hangar where his plane was taken, and medics wheeled a gurney inside. A police helicopter hovered close to the airport, and later a black SUV was seen leaving the airport accompanied by police. Its destination was not immediately clear. Crowds gathered outside the detention center for ICC suspects.

Within days, Duterte will face an initial appearance where the court will confirm his identity, check that he understands the charges against him and set a date for a hearing to assess if prosecutors have sufficient evidence to send him to a full trial.

If his case goes to trial and he is convicted, Duterte could face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.

“This is a monumental and long-overdue step for justice for thousands of victims and their families,” said Jerrie Abella of Amnesty International.

“It is therefore a hopeful sign for them, as well, in the Philippines and beyond, as it shows that suspected perpetrators of the worst crimes, including government leaders, will face justice wherever they are in the world,” Abella added.

Emily Soriano, the mother of a victim of the crackdowns , said she wanted more officials to face justice.

“Duterte is lucky he has due process, but our children who were killed did not have due process,” she said.

While Duterte's plane was in the air, grieving relatives gathered in the Philippines to mourn his alleged victims, carrying the urns of their loved ones. “We are happy and we feel relieved,” said 55-year-old Melinda Abion Lafuente, mother of 22-year-old Angelo Lafuente, who she says was tortured and killed in 2016.

Duterte's supporters, however, criticized his arrest as illegal and sought to have him returned home. Small groups of Duterte supporters and people who backed his arrest demonstrated on Wednesday outside the court before his arrival.

The ICC opened an inquiry in 2021 into mass killings linked to the so-called war on drugs overseen by Duterte when he served as mayor of the southern Philippine city of Davao and later as president.

Estimates of the death toll during Duterte's presidential term vary, from the more than 6,000 that the national police have reported and up to 30,000 claimed by human rights groups.

ICC judges who looked at prosecution evidence supporting their request for his arrest found “reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. Duterte is individually responsible for the crime against humanity of murder” as an “indirect co-perpetrator for having allegedly overseen the killings when he was mayor of Davao and later president of the Philippines,” according to his warrant.

In its statement Wednesday, the ICC outlined the technical stages of the upcoming hearing, without setting a specific date, and thanked Philippine authorities ‘'for their commitment to upholding international accountability mechanisms.''

Duterte could challenge the court's jurisdiction and the admissibility of the case. While the Philippines is no longer a member of the ICC, the alleged crimes happened before Manila withdrew from the court.

That process will likely take months and if the case progresses to trial it could take years. Duterte will be able to apply for provisional release from the court's detention center while he waits, though it's up to judges to decide whether to grant such a request.

Philippines-based GMA Integrated News posted a video Wednesday of Duterte that it said was taken while he was on the plane. “To my countrymen, just to give you the current situation,″ he said in a statement combining English and Tagalog. “This will be a long legal proceedings. I say to you, I will continue to serve you.″

Duterte's legal counsel, Salvador Panelo, told reporters in Manila that the Philippine Supreme Court “can compel the government to bring back the person arrested and detained without probable cause and compel the government bring him before the court and to explain to them why they (government) did what they did.”

Marcos said Tuesday that Duterte's arrest was “proper and correct” and not an act of political persecution.

Duterte's daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte, criticized the Marcos administration for surrendering her father to a foreign court, which she said currently has no jurisdiction in the Philippines.

She left the Philippines on Wednesday to arrange a meeting in The Hague with her detained father and talk to his lawyers, her office told reporters in Manila.

Duterte withdrew the Philippines in 2019 from the ICC, in a move human rights activists say was aimed at escaping accountability.

The Duterte administration moved to suspend the global court's investigation in late 2021 by arguing that Philippine authorities were already looking into the same allegations , arguing that the ICC — a court of last resort — therefore didn't have jurisdiction.

Appeals judges at the ICC rejected those arguments and ruled in 2023 that the investigation could resume.

The ICC judges who issued the warrant also said that the alleged crimes fall within the court's jurisdiction. They said Duterte's arrest was necessary because of what they called the “risk of interference with the investigations and the security of witnesses and victims.”

            Nearly one week after she was last seen, there are few concrete clues about what might have happened to her.

            The Dominican Republic National Police formed a “high-level commission” to work on the investigation, alongside the general prosecutor's office, the FBI and the international liaison of the US Embassy, the national police said this week.
    


            Authorities are investigating Konanki's disappearance as an “accident” and conducting a “special search operation in the ocean,” Dominican Republic President Luis Abinader said in a news conference this week.
    


            “We are concerned,” he said. “All government agencies are searching.”
    


            Abinader said the Dominican Republic receives more than 11 million visitors per year and prides itself on being a safe place for tourists. “We are one of the safest countries, not just in Latin America, but in the world in every aspect,” he said.
    


            Konanki's disappearance – and authorities' search for her in the water and on land – comes nearly two months after four tourists died after being swept away by strong currents off the coast near Punta Cana, according to the Dominican Republic's civil defense agency.
    


            The four tourists' bodies were recovered in January after they were swept away off the Arena Gorda beach in Bávaro, an area of resorts in Punta Cana, the civil defense agency said in a social media post. The four had drowned on January 18, The Associated Press reported.  Two other people also were swept away with the four, but survived, the civil defense agency said.
    


            At the time of the January drownings, a red flag was flying at the beach to warn of dangerous ocean conditions, such as strong currents and rough seas, the AP reported.
    


            The sheriff's office in Virginia's Loudoun County, where Konanki's family lives, told CNN it was advised the water was rough in Punta Cana on the night Konanki went missing last week, but could not confirm whether any warnings were in place.
    


            CNN has sought comment from Dominican Republic authorities about the conditions on March 6.
    


            Konanki traveled to the Dominican Republic with five other female students from the University of Pittsburgh on March 3, according to the sheriff's office in Virginia's Loudoun County.
    


            On March 6 around 4:15 a.m., surveillance cameras captured a group of people – Konanki, five other women and two men - entering the beach, the Dominican Republic National Police said in a release. Before heading to the beach, the group had been drinking in the hotel's lobby around an hour earlier, a source with the national police told CNN.
    


            Cameras later captured five women and one man leaving the beach around 4:55 a.m. – but not Konanki, two sources close to the investigation told CNN.
    


            Konanki appears to have stayed behind with a man in his 20s, according to a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation. Surveillance video showed the man leaving the beach area just before 9 a.m. local time Thursday without Konanki, the two sources close to the investigation said.
    


            Authorities have been interviewing the man, though he is not considered to be a suspect at this time, the law enforcement source said. He was being kept in a hotel room under police watch as the probe continues, but he is not officially detained, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN.
    


            He told authorities they both went into the ocean but he felt sick, got out of the water and fell asleep on a lounge chair, according to the source.
    


            Another law enforcement source briefed on the investigation said the man was interviewed by police several times and provided different details but there were no significant inconsistencies in his recounting of the events that night. The source said translation issues may have been a reason for the differences.
    


            When Konanki didn't come back to her room, her companions searched for her, according to the law enforcement source. The group reported her missing to hotel staff around 4 p.m. Thursday, the Riu hotel chain said in a release.
    


            Konanki's sarong-style cover-up was found on a lounge chair on the beach, but there were no signs of violence, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN.
    


            The hotel said Konanki's disappearance also coincided with a power outage that prompted multiple guests to head to the beach, The Associated Press reported.
    


            In the days since, a massive search effort involving dogs, drones and helicopters does not appear to have produced any solid leads about Konanki's whereabouts.
    


            Konanki's father, Subbarayudu Konanki, said his daughter is a “very nice girl” and “wanted to pursue a career in medicine.”
    


            She was visiting Punta Cana for spring break ahead of premed studies, her father said.
    


            Originally from India, the Konanki family has been in the US since 2006 and are permanent residents living in Virginia.
    


            Those in her hometown are praying for her safe return.
    


            “It's already four days and everybody's so worried,” family friend Shekar Pendem, who has known Konanki since she was 3, said in an interview with CNN affiliate WUSA Monday.
    


            On Monday, Dominican police said they were re-interviewing people who had been with Konanki and employees of the hotel where they were staying.
    


            As of early Tuesday, more than 300 officers, specialists, tactical units and aquatic search teams were searching the surrounding area of the hotel for any information about the woman's whereabouts, according to a post on social media by Dominican Republic National Police.
    


            The government has made available “all the necessary resources” to find Konanki, police said, including teams of forensic technicians who are analyzing images from video surveillance cameras in the area.
    


            Subbarayudu Konanki and his wife Sreedevi flew to Punta Cana with two family friends, according to The Associated Press. He has asked authorities to widen the investigation.
    


            The formal request notes that the student's belongings, including her phone and wallet, were left with her friends, “which is unusual because she always carried her phone with her,” he wrote in the report, according to ﻿radio station WTOP, as reported by the AP. It's unclear where this information came from.
    


            Konanki's father told CNN earlier he wants local authorities “to also investigate other possibilities including whether this is a case of kidnapping or human trafficking.”
    


            Civil Defense spokesperson Jensen Sánchez told the AP that the search “is underway at sea because it's presumed she drowned.”
    


            He noted it can take more than a week for a body to surface in warm waters, the AP reported.
    


            Loudoun County Sheriff Mike Chapman told NewsNation on Monday it was too early to speculate that Konanki had drowned.
    


            “It's way too premature to make an assumption like that,” Chapman said.
    


            Detectives with the sheriff's office have traveled to the Dominican Republic and have met with Konanki's family, Chapman told NBC on Tuesday.
    


            “We decided to send our own detectives down there with them (FBI) so that we're not missing anything. We want to make sure … we're getting the information firsthand,” Chapman said in the interview with NBC. “Some of the information that we've gotten so far – it has been a little disjointed, inconsistent, and we want to get it firsthand.”
    


            “We don't think she would be able to survive for more than three days in the water,” Subbarayudu told CNN Sunday. “I think something else might've happened to her.”

Follow:


            An elected leader once dubbed “The Punisher” is on his way to The Hague to face trial for crimes against humanity during a brutal war on drugs, in a breathtaking reversal of fortune for a politician who once openly boasted about killing people and placing opponents on hit lists.
    


            Rodrigo Duterte ran the Philippines for six turbulent years, during which he oversaw a brutal crackdown on drugs, openly threatened critics with death and tongue-lashed a host of global leaders from the Pope to former US President Barack Obama.
    


            A former prosecutor, congressman and mayor, Duterte built his no-holds-bared reputation in the southern Philippine city of Davao. He swept to the presidency in 2016 on a populist – and popular – promise to replicate the hardline tactics of his hometown and wage war against drugs and drug pushers across the Southeast Asian nation.
    


            “All of you who are into drugs, you sons of b**ches, I will really kill you,” he told a huge crowd in one of his many characteristically profane-laced 2016 campaign speeches. “I have no patience, I have no middle ground. Either you kill me or I will kill you idiots.”
    


            Once in power he unleashed what rights groups called “death squads” to eradicate drug pushers – many of the victims young men from impoverished shanty towns, shot by police and rogue gunmen as part of a campaign to target dealers.
    


            Police data said 6,000 people were killed. Some rights groups say the death toll could be as high as 30,000 with innocents and bystanders often caught in the crossfire.
    


            Duterte's blood-soaked presidency ended in 2022. Three years later, only 8 policemen had been convicted for 5 of the victims killed in the war on drugs, according to court documents.
    

In video posted by his daughter, Rodrigo Duterte questions his detainment. The former Philippine president was taken into custody on March 11 after the country's government said it received an International Criminal Court warrant for his arrest for alleged crimes against humanity.

            The ICC launched an investigation into allegations of “crimes against humanity” committed by Duterte during both his time as national leader and mayor of Davao.
    


            Duterte has long denied the accusations of human rights abuses and contends the drug issue is one for domestic law enforcement. He has repeatedly said he will not kowtow to foreign jurisdiction and taunted the ICC, urging prosecutors to “hurry up” and move on him.
    


            Two days before his arrest, he slammed the ICC in a typically fiery speech to supporters in Hong Kong.
    


            “From my own news, I have a warrant…from the ICC or something… these motherf***ers have been chasing me for a long time. What did I do wrong ?” he said.
    


            But the tide had suddenly turned. Authorities were waiting for Duterte to return from Hong Kong, and arrested him at the main airport in Manila, sparking chaotic scenes.
    


            As the news filtered out, many were left in shock.
    


            Some flocked to churches in the majority Catholic country to attend impromptu mass to commemorate the thousands of victims of his drug war, seeing the move as a first step towards overdue justice.
    


            And just before midnight, Duterte was back on a plane – this time bound for the Netherlands in what appeared to be a stunning end to a stormy and violent stint at the top of Philippine politics.
    


            The arrest likely owes more to Duterte being on the wrong side of a feud between two of the Philippine's most high-profile families than the might of the ICC, which cannot carry out arrests on its own and relies on the cooperation of national governments to execute warrants
    


            Duterte's clan was previously in an alliance with the famed Marcos political dynasty, with his daughter Sara Duterte-Carpio serving as deputy to current President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.
    


            But in recent months the alliance collapsed, descending into public tirades and name-calling.
    


            In October, Duterte-Carpio aired a litany of grievances against the president in a two-hour livestreamed press conference, saying she “wanted to chop his head off.”
    


            Then she said in an online news conference on November 23 that she had contracted an assassin to kill Marcos, his wife and House Speak Martin Romualdez if she were killed, a threat she warned wasn't a joke.
    


            Marcos had said the Philippines will “disengage” from any contact with the ICC, as Manila does not recognize its authority over matters of national sovereignty.
    


            That's because Duterte withdrew the Philippines from the court in 2019.
    


            But under the ICC's withdrawal mechanism, the court keeps jurisdiction over crimes committed during the membership period of a state.
    


            President Marcos said he was obliged to follow Interpol's request to arrest Duterte.
    


            “Interpol asked for help, and we obliged because we have commitments to the Interpol, which we have to fulfil. If we don't do that, they will not, they will no longer help us with other cases involving Filipino fugitives abroad,” Marcos said in a late-night presser after the plane carrying Duterte took off.
    


            Carlos Conde, a Philippines researcher for Human Rights Watch (HRW) Conde said Duterte's swift arrest and removal was a “pleasant surprise” that caught also a lot of people off guard.
    


            “The victims of the drug war – thousands of victims – have pretty much lost faith in the domestic accountability mechanisms in the Philippines. So, they were pinning their hopes on the ICC,” he told CNN.
    


            Nobel laureate Maria Ressa told CNN Duterte's arrest marks a major moment for the country and signals that years of impunity can be ended.
    


            “It's historic for the Philippines, it's the first time a Philippine president has been arrested for crimes against humanity. That an Interpol-led arrest actually ended this impunity under president Duterte that now has him going to The Hague,” said Ressa, former CNN Manila bureau chief and CEO and founder of news site Rappler.
    


            Human rights campaigner Aurora Parong told CNN many advocates and drug war victims' family members were elated with a momentary sense of relief after hearing Duterte had indeed been arrested.

            “But there is this mixed feeling of joy and hope and anxiety because we do not exactly know where this will end up to what will be the outcome. Will there really be accountability?” said Parong, who is also co-chair of the Philippine Coalition for the ICC (PCICC).
    


            But she cautioned it would be an excruciatingly long road to justice.
    


            “It is time consuming. It will take years before there will be a conviction at the International Criminal Court. The waiting is really difficult for the victims and the families of the victims of the bloody war on drugs.”
    


            Located in The Hague in the Netherlands, the ICC investigates and prosecutes individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and crimes of aggression against the territory of its member states, of which there are 125.
    


            Duterte's arrest and transfer is a significant victory for the body. The court cannot carry out arrests on its own and relies on the cooperation of national governments to execute warrants – which often rests on domestic politics and political will on whether to follow through.
    


            Many of those on its wanted list remain at large, unruffled by the serious charges laid against them.
    


            The court has been rounded on by the United States for seeking the arrests of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity for Israel's military actions in Gaza following Hamas' October 7, 2023, attack.
    


            The ICC simultaneously sought the arrests of top Hamas leaders, including Yahya Sinwar, who was later killed.
    


            Neither the US nor Israel are members of the ICC.
    


            The court has also issued a warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin for his invasion of Ukraine, although it is unlikely the warrant will be served any time soon. Putin travelled to ICC member Mongolia last year, but was not arrested.

          / CBS News
        

The U.S. Department of Education is headed for some major changes, with the department cutting its workforce by nearly 50% as the Trump administration proceeds with its plans to dismantle the agency.

President Trump has been expected to issue an executive order directing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to start the process of dissolving the agency, although the timing of such a move is unclear. According to the Education Department, the agency's workforce is being slashed from 4,133 workers to about 2,183. 

The Education Department's workforce cuts are raising questions for millions of parents, students and taxpayers about the future of the agency and how the services it provides will be handled if the agency is dismantled. 

In 1979, President Jimmy Carter signed a bill creating the Department of Education. The agency's key functions include:

The Department of Education is ""primarily about ensuring who can access the classroom — it's not so much about what is being talked about in the classroom,"" Peter Granville, a fellow at The Century Foundation and expert on higher education, told CBS MoneyWatch.

One major misconception held by many Americans is that the Education Department oversees school curriculums and learning, which are instead overseen by states and local school districts. Rather than setting public school curriculums, the Education Department's role is primarily financial, distributing billions in government money to colleges and schools and managing the federal student loan portfolio. 

""Curriculum is handled by states and local governance — the Department of Education has historically had no role in setting curriculum,"" Granville said. ""The primary role of the Department of Education has been as a grant maker and a loan lender.""

For instance, the Education Department operates the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, which is used by about 17 million students each year to apply for federal loans, grants and scholarships to attend college or vocational programs. The agency also manages $1.5 trillion in student loans, including repayment programs. 

Additionally, the Education Department handles Title I funding for low-income schools as well as for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Here's what to know about the agency.

Mr. Trump is a vocal critic of the Education Department, describing it last month as ""a big con job"" and falsely claiming the U.S. is ranked 40th in education internationally but spends the most per pupil. (Spending on K-12 education is largely determined by local school boards and funded by property taxes.)

One of the president's executive orders, signed Jan. 30, directed the Education Department to investigate ""school choice programs,"" saying that parents need ""opportunities for students to attend the school that best fits their needs."" Vouchers that allow families to pay for private K-12 schools are a priority of conservatives, as such programs allow parents to use tax credits to pay for private schools, including Christian-based institutions.

In an email earlier this month to the agency's staff entitled ""Our Department's Final Mission,"" McMahon wrote that her goal is to ""restore the rightful role of state oversight in education and to end the overreach from Washington."" That echoes language from Project 2025, the blueprint for a conservative administration written by the Heritage Foundation. 

""Federal money is inevitably accompanied by rules and regulations that keep the influx of funds from having much, if any, impact on student outcomes,"" Project 2025's section on the Education Department claims. ""Eventually, policymaking and funding should take place at the state and local level, closest to the affected families.""

Complete elimination of the Education Department would need congressional approval and 60 votes in the Senate, which is unlikely given the current makeup. 

However, the Trump administration could make changes to the agency, such as by cutting staff, without closing the entire department. The Trump administration is currently making massive employment cuts at several other federal agencies, such as the Social Security Administration and Veterans Affairs Department, describing the efforts as a way to reduce federal waste. 

The Trump administration could change some of the department's oversight duties, such as those carried out by its Office for Civil Rights, which issues guidance on how civil rights laws should be applied. Trump has suggested a different interpretation of the office's civil rights role. 

Under his administration, the department has instructed the office to prioritize complaints of antisemitism, and has opened investigations into colleges and school sports leagues for allowing transgender athletes to compete on women's teams, according to the Associated Press.

The Trump administration isn't expected to defend the Biden administration's student loan forgiveness and repayment programs, which have been tied up in court cases, experts say. Last month, the Education Department removed the online application for income-driven repayment plans, according to Business Insider. 

The Education Department manages $1.5 trillion in student loan debt for more than 40 million borrowers. Although the Trump administration hasn't outlined how it might want to reallocate the Education Department's responsibilities, student loans could be moved to the Treasury Department, Granville noted. 

""If this is going to be a smooth handoff, some other agency has to pick up what the Education Department is setting down,"" he said. ""The most logical destination is the Treasury, but I worry about the risk of disruption from any handoff.""

Project 2025 posits that student loans should be handled by a ""new government corporation with professional governance and management."" The blueprint calls for federal loans ""to be assigned directly to the Treasury Department, which would manage collections.""

Project 2025 also favors phasing out income-based repayment plans, which help borrowers lower their monthly loan payments by making them proportional to their wages and salaries, and creating a new repayment plan that would require people earning above poverty wages to pay 10% of their income toward their loans. 

""[T]here should be no loan forgiveness,"" Project 2025 states. 

The Education Department required by law to release the FAFSA on or close to Oct. 1, allowing students and their families to apply for loans and other student aid during the college application season. Families must complete the FAFSA each year a student is enrolled in a college program if they wish to qualify for loans or other aid. 

""Congress passed a law that created the FAFSA, and unless Congress creates a new law, the FAFSA has to continue,"" Granville said.

Still, it's unclear which agency would handle the FAFSA if the Department of Education is dismantled, he added. 

Much of the Education Department's money for K-12 schools is funneled through large federal programs, such as Title I for low-income schools and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Those programs support services for students with disabilities, smaller class sizes with additional teaching positions, and pay for social workers and other non-teaching roles in schools.

During his campaign, Mr. Trump called for shifting those functions to the states. He has not offered details on how the agency's core functions of sending federal money to local districts and schools would be handled.

Project 2025 suggests sending oversight of programs for kids with disabilities and low-income children first to the Department of Health and Human Services, before eventually phasing out the funding and converting it to no-strings-attached grants to states.

There's concern that making massive changes to the Education Department could impact millions of families and students who rely on the agency for loans, grants and other support, experts say. 

Moving some of those tasks to states and local governments could drive up costs for many families, said Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont. 

""That will mean higher local and state taxes to fill the void,"" Sanders said at a Thursday press conference organized by the Senate Democrats about the potential dismantling of the Education Department. ""In other words, shutting down the Department of Education would be a disaster for low income and working class families in every state of our country.""

The American Federation of Teachers, a union that represents 1.8 million K-12 teachers, said that it planned to fight the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle the agency. 

""The directive to 'return decision-making to the states' fails the smell test,"" said AFT President Randi Weingarten in a statement. ""States and districts already govern schools through locally elected school boards, as they should. They put up most of the money and control most of the decisions—from approving curriculum to deciding who graduates.""

She added, ""The Department of Education, and the laws it is supposed to execute, has one major purpose: to level the playing field and fill opportunity gaps to help every child in America succeed.""

Federal investigators looking for the cause of the January collision between a passenger jet and an Army helicopter near Washington, D.C., that killed 67 people recommended a ban on some helicopter flights Tuesday to improve safety, saying the current setup “poses an intolerable risk.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal investigators looking into the cause of the January collision between a passenger jet and an Army helicopter near Washington, D.C., that killed 67 people recommended a ban on some helicopter flights Tuesday, saying the current setup “poses an intolerable risk.”

National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy laid out frightening statistics about near misses to underscore the danger that has existed for years near Ronald Reagan National Airport and expressed anger that it took a midair collision for it to come to light.

In just over three years, she said, there were 85 close calls when a few feet (meters) in the wrong direction could have resulted in the same kind of accident that happened Jan. 29 when the military helicopter collided with an American Airlines jet over the Potomac River as the plane was approaching the airport.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said he'll adopt the NTSB's recommendations for the route where the midair collision occurred. He noted there will be some modifications in the guidelines to be released Wednesday, including allowing presidential flights and lifesaving missions.

Helicopters no longer will be “threading the needle” flying under landing planes, he said.

The National Transportation Safety Board is recommending a ban on some helicopter flights in the area where a military chopper and a passenger jet collided near Washington, D.C. AP correspondent Donna Warder reports.

The Federal Aviation Administration also will use artificial intelligence to analyze data from every airport to make sure there aren't similar dangers elsewhere, he said, adding that there are other airports with cross-traffic.




Homendy and Duffy both said the hazards at Reagan airport should have been recognized earlier by the FAA.

“The data was there. It wasn't effectively analyzed to see we had this risk,” Duffy said.

The NTSB determined that the existing separation distance between planes and helicopters at Reagan airport is “insufficient and poses an intolerable risk to aviation safety,” Homendy said. 

She said she was devastated for families that are grieving because they lost loved ones. Among the victims were 28 members of the figure skating community.

“It shouldn't take tragedy to require immediate action,” she said.

Members of several families who lost loved ones said in a statement that the NTSB's preliminary report showed this was not an isolated incident.

“It also reinforces what we, as the families of the victims, already suspected: serious, systemic failures in air travel safety cost our loved ones their lives and continues to threaten public safety,” the statement said.

Aviation lawyer Robert Clifford, who represents at least six families, said the airline had a responsibility to address known problems.

“Those charged in transportation with the highest duty of care can't run yellow lights, and they've been running flashing red lights for years, it sounds like, and it's just pathetic,” he said.

Under current practice helicopters and planes can be as close as 75 feet (23 meters) apart from each other during landing, Homendy said. Investigators have identified 15,000 instances of planes getting alerts about helicopters being in close proximity between October 2021 and December 2024, she said.

Investigators determined that planes got serious alerts to take evasive action because they were too close to a helicopter at least once a month between October 2011 and December 2024, Homendy said. In over half those instances, the helicopter may have been above its established altitude restriction for the route.

Safety advocate Mary Schiavo, a former Inspector General of the U.S. Transportation Department, called it a “shocking dereliction of duty” for the FAA to have failed to act on data the NTSB gathered in just a few weeks since the crash. She noted that the FAA had pledged to warn pilots about places with higher collision risk.

“They were going to really be proactive to warn pilots about these hotspots. I mean, this is beyond a hotspot,” Schiavo said. “This is absolutely radioactive, to have 15,214 close proximity events in three years, it's unbelievable.”

Following the midair collision, the FAA took steps to restrict helicopter flights around the airport to ensure that planes and helicopters are no longer sharing the same airspace. Now flights are put on hold temporarily when helicopters need to pass by.

The NTSB's proposal would close a vital route for law enforcement, Coast Guard patrols and government operations flights at times, but only when the runways in question are in use, and they account for only about 5% of flights at Reagan.

Homendy said the NTSB is recommending that the FAA find a “permanent solution” for alternate routes farther away for helicopter traffic.

Investigators have said the helicopter may have had inaccurate altitude readings in the moments before the crash, and the crew may not have heard key instructions from air traffic controllers. The radio altitude of the helicopter was 278 feet (85 meters), which would put it above its 200-foot (61-meter) limit for the location. 

The helicopter pilots may have also missed part of another communication, when the tower said the jet was turning toward a different runway, Homendy said last month. And the crew was wearing night-vision goggles that would have limited their peripheral vision.

The Black Hawk crew was made up of an instructor pilot with 968 hours of flight experience, a pilot with about 450 and a crew chief with nearly 1,150. Army officials have said the crew was familiar with the crowded skies around Washington.

The NTSB in its ongoing investigation will look at the amount of traffic at Reagan and the staffing in the control tower to determine if either of those factors played a role. It will take more than a year to get the final NTSB report.

Aviation safety expert John Cox said he piloted in and out of Reagan in all different kinds of planes since the late 1970s and sometimes received collision alerts about helicopters, but it was usually easy to see that they were going to pass behind him.

“That's just something that occurred going in and out of there, and it worked successfully for decades,” said Cox, who is CEO of aviation safety consulting firm Safety Operating Systems in St. Petersburg, Florida.

Multiple things had to go wrong for this collision to happen, he added.

Within just a month's time earlier this year, there were four major aviation disasters in North America, most recently in mid-February when a Delta flight flipped and landed on its roof at Toronto's Pearson Airport, injuring 21 people. 

Those accidents and close calls left some worried about the safety of flying, though fatal crashes are rare and U.S. airlines' track record is remarkably sound.

President Donald Trump blamed the midair collision on what he called an “obsolete” air traffic control system and promised to replace it. He also faulted the helicopter for flying too high. 

Federal officials have been raising concerns about an overtaxed and understaffed air traffic control system for years, especially after a series of close calls at airports. 

Doug Lane, whose wife Christine Conrad Lane, and their 16-year-old son Spencer, died in the crash, said Tuesday he hopes the way the near-misses are reported gets a closer look and that NTSB recommendations will be implemented.

“If we're going to invest in an organization like this, it needs to be outfitted with state of the art technology and given staffing at a level that's going to set them up for success,” Lane said.

Duffy said Tuesday that he will present an expensive plan to Congress within the next few weeks to overhaul the system with new technology. He hopes to complete it within four years.

House Republicans passed a stopgap bill to keep government funding at current levels until September. Now the measure heads to the Senate, where its fate is uncertain.

What's in the Stopgap Funding Bill?

Julia Demaree Nikhinson|AP

House Speaker Mike Johnson of La., holds the gavel before President Donald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress in the House chamber at the U.S. Capitol, March 4, 2025, in Washington, D.C.

House Republicans narrowly passed their stopgap funding bill Tuesday despite a nearly-united “no” vote from Democrats and one Republican.

The measure, a 99-page “clean” continuing resolution that will largely keep government funding at current levels in most areas through September while offering some steep spending cuts in a handful of other places, passed 217-213, with all Republicans except Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky voting for it. Rep. Jared Golden of California was the only Democrat to vote for it.

The bill is now headed to the Senate, where its fate is uncertain. Given the GOP's 53-seat majority and already one no vote from the caucus, at least eight Democrats will have to come out in support. But Democrats in the chamber have already blasted the bill and are offering a shorter-term version.

Lawmakers have until Friday to handle the matter or risk another potential government shutdown this week.

While the largest fight facing the chambers is the funding bill, they're also grappling with the budget process on a separate track. Both chambers have passed frameworks, and Republicans in the House and Senate are working together to merge them. The finished product, which has to be adopted by both chambers, seeks to enact larger parts of President Donald Trump's sweeping agenda. While that blueprint is proceeding parallel to the spending bill, some of the disputes involved have bled over to harden divisions between the parties as they attempt to pass the stopgap bill.

Aneeta Mathur-Ashton March 10, 2025



Here's what's in the stopgap bill and what could tank it.

The bill will keep funding the government at the current levels set last year by former President Joe Biden until September, which is a major concession for House Republicans. It will also notably bypass the yearly appropriations process in which Congress directs how to allocate the funds, allowing the Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency wide leeway in deciding how money is spent.

House Republicans plan to cut $13 billion in discretionary spending on areas other than defense and increase defense spending by $6 billion. An additional $6 billion for veterans' health care is included.

Disaster relief for California was not included, and several programs – including international peacekeeping and National Institutes of Health research – will be hit. Add-ons include a $20 billion cut to IRS enforcement and an increase for Immigration and Customs Enforcement's deportation operation.

Most importantly, though, the cuts in spending do not touch key programs like Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare, which notably drew the ire of Republican voters when cuts to Medicaid were included in the budget blueprint.

Proposed cuts to DOGE were also left out, with Johnson saying they can be addressed in next year's spending talks.

DECISION POINTS: 



The bill will also affect Washington, D.C., the local budget of which is overseen by Congress.

The spending bill would effectively undo the District's 2025 budget, doling out an estimated $1 billion in cuts and forcing it to go back to its 2024 budget until Oct. 1. Such a move would likely affect everything from law enforcement to schools.

D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser's administration warned over the weekend that the proposed budget could result in layoffs and furloughs for teachers and other front-line workers as an estimated 16% of the remaining budget would need to be trimmed to comply.

The stopgap bill would cut funding mid-way through the fiscal year, when the District is already spending at its ostensibly congressionally approved fiscal 2025 levels, a memo from her office on Saturday said.

“This means a nearly $945 million cut for the District, impacting teachers, firefighters, and law enforcement,” it added.

Hours before Tuesday's successful vote, Johnson announced House votes scheduled for the rest of the week would be canceled and that the chamber would be in recess – a move that puts more pressure on the Senate to pass the measure because the House won't be free to renegotiate a deal if the bill fails before the shutdown deadline. That decision has now placed Democrats in the chamber between a rock and a hard place.

""There are really only two options,” Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine said after Tuesday's vote. “Vote for a pretty bad CR. Or … vote for a potentially even worse shutdown.""

Democrats in the upper chamber met for two hours on Tuesday with no clear consensus on how to proceed. Lawmakers coming out of the meeting remained tight-lipped about what they discussed and what they will do.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer declined to comment on the matter, opting to instead joke about the food served at the meeting. He also avoided talking about it on the Senate floor on Tuesday.

Some senators, like Democratic Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, are saying voting against the bill isn't worth delivering such a catastrophic blow to the government even if the measure isn't ideal. But others are leaning toward casting a vote for a shutdown.

In a floor speech Tuesday night Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts blasted the measure as a “shutdown bill” for which Republicans are responsible.

""This proposal makes crystal clear where Republicans' values lie. After months of bipartisan talks, they're walking away from the negotiating table and offering a non-starter House bill that forces us to the brink of a full government shutdown,” she said. “The Republican shutdown playbook is dangerous, and it will hurt working families.""

Warren notably stopped short of revealing how she plans to vote but said House Democrats were right to oppose it and that the Senate should do the same.

But Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota offered harsh words for Democrats Tuesday, saying they will bear full responsibility for a shut down if they block the House-passed bill.

“Without action from Congress, the government will run out of funding come Friday,” he said, adding that a shutdown would be “entirely of the Democrats' making.”

The Federal Trade Commission asked a judge in Seattle to delay the start of its trial accusing Amazon of duping consumers into signing up for its Prime program, citing resource constraints.

Attorneys for the FTC made the request during a status hearing on Wednesday before Judge John Chun in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. Chun had set a Sept. 22 start date for the trial.

Jonathan Cohen, an attorney for the FTC, asked Chun for a two-month continuance on the case due to staffing and budgetary shortfalls.

The FTC's request comes amid a push by the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency to reduce spending. DOGE, which is led by tech baron Elon Musk, has slashed the federal government's workforce by more than 62,000 workers in February alone.

""We have lost employees in the agency, in our division and on our case team,"" Cohen said.

Chun asked Cohen how the FTC's situation ""will be different in two months"" if the agency is ""in crisis now, as far as resources."" Cohen responded by saying that he ""cannot guarantee if things won't be even worse."" He pointed to the possibility that the FTC may have to move to another office ""unexpectedly,"" which could hamper its ability to prepare for the trial.

""But there's a lot of reason to believe ... we may have been through the brunt of it, at least for a little while,"" Cohen said.

John Hueston, an attorney for Amazon, disputed Cohen's request to push back the trial date.

""There has been no showing on this call that the government does not have the resources to proceed to trial with the trial date as presently set,"" Hueston said. ""What I heard is that they've got the whole trial team still intact. Maybe there's going to be an office move. And by the way, both in government and private sector, I've never heard of an office move being more than a few days disruptive.""

The FTC sued Amazon in June 2023, alleging that the online retailer was deceiving millions of customers into signing up for its Prime program and sabotaging their attempts to cancel it. Amazon has denied any wrongdoing, calling the FTC's claims ""wrong on the facts and the law.""

""Amazon tricked and trapped people into recurring subscriptions without their consent, not only frustrating users but also costing them significant money,"" former FTC Chair Lina Khan said at the time.

The FTC brought a separate case against Amazon in September 2023 accusing it of wielding an illegal monopoly. The agency alleged that Amazon prevents sellers from offering cheaper prices elsewhere through its anti-discounting measures. That case is set to go to trial in October 2026.

In the time since the FTC filed its cases, Khan has been replaced as the head of the FTC by Trump appointee Andrew Ferguson. Tech companies, which are the target of several regulatory agencies, have sought to curry favor with Trump, including Amazon founder and executive chairman Jeff Bezos. He attended President Donald Trump's inauguration in January, and Amazon was among several tech companies to donate $1 million to Trump's inauguration committee.

More than eight out of every 10 respondents to a Morgan Stanley survey believe Tesla CEO Elon Musk's controversial political activities are hurting his business.

In total, 85% of the 245 participants polled by the firm believe Musk's foray into politics has either had a ""negative"" or ""extremely negative"" impact on business fundamentals. The majority of respondents also expect Tesla deliveries to fall this year, according to the survey.

While a small sampling, these results offer the latest sign of mounting frustration with the billionaire entrepreneur as he's become a rising figure in international and American politics. It also comes at a pivotal point for Tesla's stock, with shares plunging nearly 40% this year.

When asked about Musk's efforts with U.S. government efficiency and other political activities, 45% of respondents said these actions had a ""negative"" effect on the company. Another 40% said they were having an ""extremely negative"" impact.

On the other hand, 3% said they were ""positive"" for the business. Meanwhile, 12% called them ""insignificant.""

To be sure, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas reported that his survey respondents are drawn from his email distribution list and should not be taken as a random representative sample. He also noted that the respondents are not necessarily owners of Tesla stock. The survey was taken over a 17-hour period, starting on Tuesday afternoon.

Jonas also asked about expectations for the company's performance. In a separate question, 59% said they anticipated Tesla would deliver fewer cars to customers in 2025 compared with the prior year. What's more, 21% of total respondents said they expected a decline of more than 10%. That comes as some analysts have raised alarm that recent reports of vandalism could spook potential customers.

Just 19% of responders said they forecasted deliveries to rise in 2025, while another 23% said they would be flat between the two years.

Musk's political profile has grown after his public support of President Donald Trump in the runup up to last year's election and his subsequent role leading the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The Tesla executive's efforts to slash the federal government's spending and workforce has drawn the ire of critics who see his team as working too quickly and haphazardly.

Musk acknowledged in an interview with Fox Business on Monday that his high-profile role in Trump's administration meant he was running his businesses, which also include X and SpaceX, ""with great difficulty."" That day, Tesla shares tumbled more than 15% for their worst session since 2020.

Despite the recent nosedive, 45% of respondents said they anticipate Tesla shares will be at least 11% higher by the end of the calendar year. Around 36% expect the stock to tumble another 11% or further by year-end, while 19% see the stock staying within 10% of its price around $220.

After a New York Times report last week unearthed criticisms of Musk's team from members of Trump's cabinet, the president offered a vote of confidence on Tuesday. Trump evaluated five Tesla vehicles parked at the White House after the president said on social media that he would buy one as a symbol of support.

Trump also said he would declare violence at Tesla dealerships to be acts of domestic terrorism.

Intel (INTC) stock climbed higher Wednesday on a report that rival Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is in talks with a group of chipmakers, including Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD), that would run Intel's chip manufacturing business.

According to Reuters, the consortium, which would also include Broadcom (AVGO), would take over Intel's foundry business, which is responsible for building chips for both Intel and third-party contractors. Intel reported a net loss of $18.8 billion in 2024; the foundry segment saw a total operating income loss of $11.6 billion on the year.

Shares of Intel were up roughly 3% in afternoon trading following the report and are up 1.6% year to date. Zoom out further, however, and Intel's stock price is down 54% over the past 12 months.

AI chip giant Nvidia's stock price is off 14% year to date on concerns that the AI trade has run its course and that tariffs and export controls will handicap the company's sales moving forward. Still, Nvidia shares are up 24% over the past year.

Shares of TSMC, Broadcom, and Nvidia rose on the news.

Intel had no comment on the report.

The moves come as the Trump administration works to guarantee the future of Intel's chip-building business in the US. While Intel is the country's largest chip manufacturer, the US accounts for only 12% of the world's chip production, down from 37% in 1990.

Those declines came into stark relief during the COVID-19 pandemic, when chip shortages impacted everything from consumer electronics to automotive sales. US officials have also raised concerns about the potential for geopolitical conflict, including fears that China could invade Taiwan, and natural disasters disrupting chip shipments to the US, which could dramatically impact large swaths of the economy.

The Trump administration has previously pushed for TSMC to buy up part of Intel's business in the hopes of propping it up over the long term.

Former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger tried to spin up the company's foundry segment into a third-party chip manufacturer to rival TSMC's own semiconductor fabrication business.

But the effort has been slow going so far, and Intel's board ousted Gelsinger last year. Co-CEOs David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus are currently steering the ship until the board finds Gelsinger's permanent replacement.

Both Intel and TSMC have received billions of dollars via the CHIPS Act to help them pay for new manufacturing facilities in the US. On March 3, TSMC said it would invest $100 billion to build new plants in Arizona in addition to the $65 billion it already earmarked for the region.

Intel is also constructing new plants in the US, including a massive campus in Ohio, but recently announced that part of the project is delayed and won't be completed until 2030. It was initially slated to open in 2025.

Uncertainty about the global economy and Trump's tariff plans have triggered a sell-off in the US stock market.

And with this volatility in markets, strategists at BNP Paribas expect gold to be a beneficiary amid what it calls ""Trump tariff chaos and geopolitical shifts.""

In a note to clients on Wednesday, BNP senior commodity strategist David Wilson said the firm expects gold prices to breach $3,000 per ounce for the first time and ultimately reach $3,100 in the coming months.

""The Trump administration issuing a slew of tariff threats and the realigning of international relationships have added a new layer of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, providing a significant boost to gold,"" Wilson wrote in a note on Wednesday.

BNP's strategists raised their average 2025 forecast average by 8%, with prices expected to push above $3,100 per ounce during the second quarter of 2025, noting tariff fears have ""dramatically"" tightened the physical gold market.

On Wednesday, gold futures (GC=F) rose above $2,940 per ounce as US tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from all countries took effect. Canada and the EU have responded with reciprocal tariffs.

""Physical tightness due to the surge in demand for moving gold into the US ahead of tariffs, a pick-up in central bank buying and an acceleration in physically-backed ETF gold demand have been key YTD gold price supportive factors, and we expect this to continue through 2025,"" Wilson wrote.

However, Wilson forecasts that in the second half of 2025, ""the gold market will price in or normalize"" Trump-driven trade risks.

The strategist argues that without an ongoing escalation in trade tensions, gold prices will struggle to maintain further upside momentum in the second half of the year.

Gold futures have rallied more than 12% year to date, hitting multiple record highs since January.

Wall Street has attributed much of these gains to continued central bank buying and tariff uncertainty, including the possibility that even imports of the precious metal into the US won't be spared.

Institutional investors have shipped elevated amounts of physical gold bars to vaults in New York in a move to front-run tariffs and take advantage of a price disparity between London and New York.

Last month, Goldman Sachs analysts raised their year-end gold price forecast to $3,100 per ounce, up from their prior projection of $2,890.

Over the past year, the safe-haven asset has handily outperformed the US stock market, with the price of an ounce of gold rising more than 35% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) has gained just over 8% in that period.

Oops, something went wrong

Elon Musk made good on his promise to appeal a controversial decision by a Delaware judge who wiped out his $56 billion performance-based compensation plan as the Tesla (TSLA) CEO leads a revolt that is roiling that state's politics.

The billionaire, along with current and former Tesla directors, argued in an appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court on Tuesday that a refusal by Delaware Chancery Court judge Kathaleen McCormick to reinstate Musk's pay despite approvals from Tesla shareholders contained multiple errors that should lead to the ruling's reversal.

""Yes, Tesla has a chance"" to succeed with its new appeal, said Tulane University law professor Ann Lipton. But “the situation is complicated by the fact that the entire decision has turned into a political football.""

McCormick initially voided the pay pact in January 2024 and did so for a second time last December based on the claims of a single shareholder who alleged in a purported class-action lawsuit that Musk's influence over Tesla made him a de facto controller of Tesla.

McCormick concluded that ""extensive ties"" between Musk and the people negotiating the pay package and a lack of public disclosure about Musk's relationships with those who approved the deal made it invalid under Delaware's corporate laws.

Musk responded by pledging to pull the incorporations of his many companies, including Tesla, out of Delaware.

These so-called ""Dexits"" were followed by decisions from executives at other companies to reincorporate elsewhere, including Bill Ackman's hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, as some aired their frustrations with Delaware's powerful Chancery Court.

The recent high-profile departures are roiling a state that, for roughly the past century, has been the dominant place to incorporate because of its so-called corporate-friendly laws, specialized business courts, and ease of filing company documents.

The state's newly elected governor, Matt Meyer, launched a working group to study mounting complaints, and lawmakers are trying to push through a bill that would limit investor lawsuits by allowing corporate boards to further insulate their directors, officers, and controlling shareholders from liability.

The measure is not retroactive and, therefore, wouldn't absolve Musk or other litigants from past determinations.

Semafor reported last week that the legislation was prompted by warnings from key corporate attorneys that big-name companies, including Walmart (WMT), might move out of the state.

The political drama in Delaware could play a role in what the state's highest court decides to do about Musk's pay.

Lipton, the Tulane professor, cited the many complications: ""Musk attacking the Delaware courts, his allies threatening to leave the state, and the state legislature on the verge of passing a new statute that reads like a direct rebuke to the Delaware courts.”

“It's not clear to me whether that's likely to influence the Delaware Supreme Court — in either direction,” she added.

What Musk and the Tesla directors are arguing in their appeal is that the lower court applied the wrong, heightened legal test to evaluate actions taken by Tesla's board around the compensation plan.

They said McCormick incorrectly subjected the board's actions to the “entire fairness” standard, then misapplied it. That standard is applied to protect shareholders when a controlling shareholder negotiates a self-interested deal with the board.

Musk's status as a limited minority stockholder at the time of the negotiations, they said, should not have led to his designation as a controlling shareholder.

New York University School of Law professor Marcel Kahan said the Supreme Court will decide what particular issues to address in the case and he suspects that it will want to clarify the definition of ""controlling shareholder.""

That matter is now the subject of the controversial proposed legislation in Delaware to amend the state's corporate law. The proposed changes would exempt shareholders with less than 33.3% ownership.

""My guess is the court will want to put its five cents in on 'controller creep,'"" Kahan said, referring to the court's expansion of circumstances that can subject a shareholder to ""controller"" status.

""I would not at all be surprised if the court comes to a different finding on whether Musk is a controlling shareholder than the Chancery court,"" Kahan added.

Musk and the Tesla directors are also arguing that McCormick's invalidation of a second Tesla shareholder vote about Musk's compensation constituted yet another error because the vote showed that the electric vehicle company's shareholders “resoundingly rejected” her initial finding that Musk was overpaid.

The fact that Tesla stockholders have since received a return of more than $700 billion on their investment in Musk, they said, shows the compensation plan exemplified alignment between executive and stockholder interests.

With McCormick's decision, shareholders ""have lost their say in compensating the company's once-in-a-generation CEO"" and ""lost certainty in the company they own.""

""The bottom line of the Court of Chancery's decisions is that a compensation plan resulting in spectacular growth should be revoked because it was somehow unfair to the very stockholders who benefited from that growth and overwhelmingly approved the plan — twice.""

For Musk to keep his $56 billion, said Kahan of New York University, the court would have to reverse both McCormick's finding that Musk was a controlling shareholder at the time he negotiated his pay deal with Tesla's board and her finding that the shareholder revote failed to “cleanse” — take steps to legally validate — the flawed transaction.

As for cleansing, he said, ""I can see the court saying, 'You were a little too tough here.'"" Cleansing solely shifts the burden of proving whether $56 billion was fair from the defendants to the plaintiffs.

""If $56 billion is too high, it doesn't follow that zero is the right amount, right? Zero may be too low.""

In that case, the court could send the case back to the lower court and instruct it to pick an amount of fair compensation.

Apple's (AAPL) artificial intelligence efforts are in trouble. The company, which debuted its Apple Intelligence platform during its WWDC developer conference last year, was banking on the software to help boost sales of its iPhone and other products. But so far, the gambit has fallen flat, with iPhone sales declining year over year during its most recent quarter.

And now the tech giant says it's delaying the release of a planned smarter version of Siri, one of the more anticipated aspects of its AI strategy. According to Apple, the new Siri is taking longer than the company expected and should come out later this year.

On top of that, Apple is still working to get Apple Intelligence up and running in China, one of its most important markets. AI is a major selling point for smartphone shoppers in the region, according to market research firm Canalys, and local players like Honor and Xiaomi are quickly filling the void.

Apple's stock price, meanwhile, continues to get hammered along with the rest of its Big Tech cohort. Shares are down 11% year to date, joining Nvidia (NVDA), which is off 17%, and Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), which have both fallen 9%.

On Wednesday, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring lowered his price target on Apple from $275 to $252 on concerns that the Siri delays will impact iPhone upgrade cycles throughout 2025 and 2026. According to Woodring, roughly 50% of iPhone owners who didn't upgrade to the iPhone 16, said they held onto their older phones due to Apple Intelligence delays.

""It kind of shocks the system a little bit for Apple to have a delay of about a year,"" Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance.

""And I think it just speaks to everything that's gone on below the surface. Above the surface, the message is Apple intelligence is ... going to be great. And below the surface there, they've got a lot of work to do,"" he added.

If Apple is going to turn around its AI plans, it'll have to do so sooner than later or risk falling further behind its rivals both in the US and abroad.

Apple Intelligence was supposed to be one of the biggest reasons for consumers to upgrade to the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro. But the company didn't launch its software platform until October last year, well over a month after it released its latest smartphone lineup.

What's more, despite showing off a number of Apple Intelligence capabilities during WWDC 2024, the company said it would slowly roll out the service's features throughout the remainder of 2024 and 2025. That made upgrading to the latest iPhone less appealing since users wouldn't get the full set of its most important features for several months.

And while the company has released capabilities like writing tools, notification summaries, and photo editing tools, those aren't the kind of features that will get customers to line up in droves for new iPhones.

""This has been a debacle ever since [Apple] released Apple Intelligence,"" said Zeus Kerravala, founder and principal analyst of ZK Research. ""If you think about it, even from the initial launch, it really wasn't very clear what Apple intelligence was.""

It doesn't help that Apple initially advertised Apple Intelligence with an ad featuring actor Bella Ramsey seemingly using a full version of the software even though a number of functions still weren't available.

""I really think they reacted to the AI hype,"" Kerravala said. ""They weren't really ready to even understand how they were going to use it. And they came out with something that was half-baked, which I think in a lot of ways shows the pressure that Apple's under.""

Meanwhile, Apple competitors Samsung (005930.KS) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), both of which use Google's Gemini AI platform, continue to add more AI functionality to their devices, including agentic AI features similar to those promised as part of the reimagined Siri.

The fact that the botched Apple Intelligence launch comes after the company's Vision Pro headset failed to gain traction among consumers compounds the appearance that Apple can't quite innovate like it once could.

Still, while Apple's AI era is off to a disappointing start, the company has plenty of runway to gain steam in the AI wars. Other past Apple products have landed with a thud only to take off later with consumers later, including the Apple Watch and AirPods.

""I think they're going to figure it out,” Munster said. ""I think it's darkest before dawn. They've got an incredibly loyal base that trusts them.""

But it could still take time for Apple to not only launch its AI features but also get them right.

""I don't think there are any short-term fixes here,” said Moor Insights & Strategy founder and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead. ""Even in 2026, I'll be surprised if all the capabilities are there.""

If there are any blunt reminders for investors enduring a portfolio battering right now, it's to brace for several more years of volatility under the Trump administration.

Expect the expected, as financial services veteran Penny Pennington says.

""We've had a couple of pretty sanguine years and years where we didn't see the usual two or three pullbacks of 5% to 15%. That's a very typical thing to happen. And so, in a moment where we've got uncertainty from policy and tariffs and things like that, the markets are reacting. It was to be expected. And so investors are reacting,"" the Edward Jones CEO told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in below).

""One of the things that we would be saying [to clients] is, we told you this was probably going happen at some point. We didn't wanna believe it,"" she added.

Suffice it to say that investors have been caught asleep at the wheel by Trump's chaotic approach to tariffs and DOGE-driven government cutbacks. Their convergence has stoked recession fears this month and put stocks further into the tank in 2025.

Fresh economic data for consumer confidence from the Dallas Fed survey has painted a picture of increasingly cautious consumers and businesses. Mighty retailer Walmart (WMT) is seeing its lower-income shopper fret once again about inflation, new research reveals.

Watch: Gap CEO is monitoring tariffs every hour

And the market is moving violently to price in a potential growth slowdown.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), S&P 500 (^GSPC), and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) are down about 5% on average in March alone. Led by plunges in large-cap tech names such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA), the Nasdaq is down the most in March, with a 6% drop as investors sell off risk.

On the year, the Nasdaq is down by nearly 10%, the S&P 500 is off by 6%, and the Dow 3%.

The recent market setback is serving to reset high investor expectations, wrote Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner.

 

In turn, investors have flocked to perceived safe-haven areas of the market in consumer staples and healthcare. European stocks also caught a bid on the view that those countries' economic growth will outperform the US this year.

Pennington joined Edward Jones as a financial adviser just before the tech bubble burst in 2000. While she doesn't think markets are on the cusp of a similar bubble burst, the pullback should make investors aware of the need to stay diversified.

That means owning other risk assets besides the ""Magnificent Seven.""

""Right now as it relates to investment management, we are being rewarded for diversification in this moment,"" Pennington said. ""Diversification really, really works. It works in the long term and it works in times of uncertainty. So when the market is broadening out and becoming more defensive, rotating very quickly from those Mag 7 names, the promise of diversification really plays out.""

Oops, something went wrong

A nearly 10% fall in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) has prompted Wall Street strategists to revaluate their bullish views headed into 2025.

And late Tuesday night, Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin became the first big name on the Street to lower their year-end price target for the S&P 500 following this drop, with Kostin cutting his year-end target to 6,200 from 6,500.

""We lower our 2025 year-end S&P 500 index target to 6200 (from 6500) to reflect a 4% reduction in our modeled fair-value forward P/E multiple (20.6x from 21.5x),"" Kostin and his team wrote.

""Our new index target suggests an 11% price gain during the balance of the year, similar to our return estimate at the start of the year but from a lower starting point.""

Earlier this week, the S&P 500 nearly entered correction territory — defined as a 10% drop from its most recent high — as fears about the health of the US economy and uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff policy shook investor confidence.

Goldman's own economics team recently revised down its 2025 GDP forecast to 1.7% from a prior projection of 2.2% as impacts from tariffs and political uncertainty have weighed on the outlook.

Kostin flagged the GDP downgrade in his note on Tuesday, saying this slower growth forecast prompted a downward revision in its estimate for S&P 500 earnings growth this year to 7% from 9%.

""Our revised estimates reflect the recently reduced GDP growth forecast of our US Economics team, a higher assumed tariff rate, and higher level of uncertainty that is typically associated with a greater equity risk premium,"" Kostin wrote.

""Weaker economic activity usually means weaker corporate earnings growth.""

Kostin noted a catalyst that improves the economic growth outlook, either evidenced by stronger economic data or a reduced tariff policy plan that could spur an upturn in stocks. On Wednesday, perhaps the first sign of better economic data emerged as a softer-than-expected inflation reading sent the major stock indexes higher at the market open.

And while Kostin may be the first strategist to outright lower their year-end target for the S&P, Kostin isn't the only strategist who has recently warned that the path forward for US stocks likely looks different than last year's forecasts.

""We have seen the US equity market on a rocky path higher through year-end, and have believed that our 6,600 can absorb a 5-10% drawdown,"" RBC Capital Markets head of US equity strategy Lori Calvasina wrote in a note to clients on Sunday.

""The risks of a drawdown of more than 10% have admittedly grown, however. If that occurs, we see a 'growth scare' of a 14-20% decline from peak as most likely, which could shift us into our bear case.""

Oops, something went wrong

Investors are trying to make sense of President Trump's willingness to shrug off market losses in recent days.

A review of the president's commentary suggests perhaps a simple answer: He just cares more about tariffs during his second go-around in the White House so far.

""Markets are going to go up, and they're going to go down, but you know what: We have to rebuild our country,"" he said Tuesday afternoon in a trade-focused refrain that the president has sharpened in recent days even as market pressure has mounted.

And the economic fallout is clearly in evidence with markets in correction territory, a trade war breaking out on multiple fronts, Wall Street increasingly worried about stagflation, and Trump being peppered with questions on the topic at nearly every public appearance in recent days.

Trump has pivoted on plenty of tariff specifics — including a proposed 50% tariff on Canadian steel and aluminum that lasted less than 8 hours on Tuesday — but the longtime ""tariff man"" has remained remarkably consistent about what he sees as his ultimate goal of significant long-term tariff revenues and a reorientation of the US trading system.

It's a tariff-first focus that is perhaps not surprising to observers of Trump who saw him prioritize tariffs above all else at nearly every campaign stop in 2024. But it clearly represents a whiplash for traders who expected the president to pivot quickly once in office in deference to the markets (as he often did during his first term).

Read more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet

This time around, Trump is clearly choosing tariffs so far, with markets repeatedly underestimating his pain tolerance.

In his first 50 or so days in office — in spite of what one observer quipped was ""Ross and Rachel"" levels of uncertainty — Trump has already enacted a tariff agenda that will dwarf the economic impact of his first term if it's simply left in place.

New blanket tariffs of 20% on China have been enacted on top of existing duties. The world's second-largest economy is now facing overall duties of about 30% with Trump 1.0 tariffs still in place.

Also in place are 25% duties on a range of goods from Mexico and Canada. And the new entrant this week is a 25% tariff on global imports of steel and aluminum that took effect Wednesday.

""The one fixed point for Donald Trump is he loves tariffs,"" Jason Furman of Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, said in a recent Yahoo Finance Live appearance in a common refrain of close Trump trade observers.

""That's the one thing that there's no whipsawing on,"" he added.

Indeed, it is the topic of markets that Trump is more likely to change his tune on.

Yahoo Finance once isolated five different stages of how Trump talked about markets while President Biden was in office, and his rhetoric changed dramatically depending on Wall Street's ups and downs.

Trump has also passed up opportunity after opportunity to soften the edges of his tariff rhetoric, even before wary business audiences that are clearly looking for some relief.

""It may go up higher,"" Trump even warned of duties on Tuesday evening before a group of CEOs assembled by the Business Roundtable.

He added that tariffs represent ""a big win, that's a lot of money"" while also telling the business leaders that ""the biggest win is if they move into our country and produce jobs.""

The president addressed the Business Roundtable — which calls itself ""the voice of America's leading CEOs in Washington"" — at the group's offices Tuesday evening.

About 230 of America's top CEOs are members of the group, with many prominent and perhaps tariff-wary names — from Google (GOOG) CEO Sundar Pichai, Verizon (VZ) CEO Hans Vestberg to JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon — in attendance Tuesday.

It comes after a flurry of CEO warnings about tariffs across a range of sectors.

One of the most colorful comments came from Ford (F) CEO Jim Farley, who has warned Trump tariffs threaten to ""blow a hole"" in the US auto industry.

The head of Rubbermaid added a warning of uncertainty and the head of Lego said he didn't want tariffs to blunt his company's momentum in recent interviews with Yahoo Finance.

White House officials and Trump himself have often countered that recent turbulence is part of an economic ""transition"" that will see the economy come out stronger in the end. They have also often touted reports of companies eyeing possible expansion in the United States to avoid the duties.

Indeed, the somewhat new ""no pain, no gain"" message from Trump has led to a wide array of euphemisms from the president and his allies to wave away market troubles — from a ""detox period"" to ""a little turbulence"" to ""growing pains"" — but with a single message that the president clearly thinks the current turbulence is a sort of medicine that's worth taking in the service of the higher calling of tariffs.

""I think our country had to do this,"" Trump added Tuesday.

Harvard University executive fellow Bill George noted Tuesday afternoon that one of the best things CEOs can do at the moment, given Trump's approach, ""is to stay below the radar.""

The president has suggested he is in for the long run with his tariff-focused approach but, Trump being Trump, he couldn't avoid a bit of market punditry this week suggesting people buy the dip.

""I have a lot of very smart people, friends of mine and great businessmen,"" he told reporters this week. ""They're now investing.""

What we're reading

Economic data releases and earnings

Red, ugly charts on our platform are capturing the unease of the moment. But economic growth is also on the chopping block.

In recent interviews, President Trump has expressed a stony, unmoving outlook toward the stock market, as if his goals for the American economy are more important than the whims of Wall Street. He and his economic advisers have advanced a long-term view, acknowledging supposed short-term pains through a variety of euphemisms and metaphors like ""detox,"" ""disturbance,"" and “transition.”

But if there is a method to the market madness, we won't see its fruits for some time. All the while, current measures and forecasts of the ""real"" economy are getting darker.

Economic teams have lowered their 2025 GDP expectations. Morgan Stanley now predicts 1.5% growth in 2025, down from 1.9%, while Goldman Sachs dropped its expectations from 2.4% to 1.7%.

To a certain extent, Trump's America First team has a point to make: Why should a select group of investment bankers and money managers dictate a nation's economic agenda? The stock market, in its worst light, is also a collection of trend chasers and buzzword vultures, a vortex of fickleness and insatiable cravings. (A more holistic reading of the market taking into account regular folks' retirement accounts is gently brushed to the side here.)

But it also expresses something that neither bully pulpit cajoling nor DOGE threats can touch: If most people actually believed Trump's decisions would lead to long-term growth, the stock market would move up, not down.

If GDP figures match the increasingly dismal forecasts, the president's aims may prove to be too ambitious to be worth the effort.

In the initial phase after the inauguration, a sympathetic view among strategists was that in exchange for the negative impacts of tariffs and public sector job losses, the economy overall would benefit from deregulation, lower energy prices, and a more business-favorable tax regime. But the market is catching up to the idea that the painful shocks will come first, while the anticipated benefits may only arrive later.

""The pain is worth the gain down the road ... That is the new narrative coming out of Washington,"" Mohamed El-Erian, president at Queens College, Cambridge, and former PIMCO CEO, told Yahoo Finance earlier this week.

But the journey may become too difficult for the destination, he said. If GDP growth slows to a ""stall speed"" of 1% or below, even the rosy outlook of a more efficient economy that operates in a fairer global trading environment doesn't look so good.

Adding to the rough sequence of events is the overarching challenge of inflation. Wednesday will bring February's Consumer Price Index (CPI), offering fresh insight into the impacts of tariffs and the threats of more to come. As uncomfortable as a market correction makes investors feel, the onset of stagflation would be much harder to wave off.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is nearly 10% off its most recent record high as fears over slowing economic growth have gripped investors and spawned a stock market sell-off.

Now, the pressing question for investors becomes: What has the market told us, and does this decline have further to go?

""The S&P is already down close to 9% since its highs, suggesting a shallow recession scenario is already reflected,"" HSBC head of equity strategy for the Americas Nicole Inui wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.

""Even taking the average of all recessions (including deep recessions) the sell-offs have been 11%-12%, again suggesting we may be near the bottom.""

With Tuesday's close, the S&P 500 is now down 9.3% from its record closing high of 6,144 on Feb. 19.

Economic data has largely come in weaker than expected to start 2025, prompting economists to downgrade their outlooks for economic growth this year.

The prevailing market fear is that President Trump's current economic policies — namely tariffs, federal job cuts, and strict immigration — could further slow economic growth. Still, few economists are actually calling for a recession in the US economy this year.

Read more: What is a recession, and how does it impact you?

And should forecasts for the US to avoid recession come to pass, a sell-off pricing in a ""shallow recession"" could ultimately serve as a buying opportunity.

In this case, HSBC's Inui sees opportunity in tech, after a large sell-off over the past month has lowered valuations, and financials, a top sector over the past year that has limited tariff exposure.

Still, some strategists tell Yahoo Finance that a traditional recession playbook might not work in the current market moment.

""It's not easy to price out how tariffs may influence the US economy, but it's possible,"" JPMorgan Asset Management global market strategist Jack Manley told Yahoo Finance.

""What becomes a lot more difficult is pricing in how Canada might respond to tariffs from the US and how those could lead to additional tariffs. It snowballs very, very quickly and makes pricing in anything extremely difficult.""

For instance, the current flow of tariff news is back and forth, to say the least.

Just take Tuesday's whipsaw market action — stocks fell on news Trump would double some tariffs on Canada; hours later, stocks recouped some losses after Trump said he'd consider scaling back some tariffs on Canada.

""It's hard to say that [the market] is pricing in slow growth or no growth because one of the things that makes this environment so difficult — if you talk to almost any company or listen to what they're saying— there's basically no visibility on the macro outlook or on their own outlooks, because of tariff and trade policy,"" Charles Schwab senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon told Yahoo Finance.

There's also little clarity on which of Trump's tariff proposals will stick, how long they'll last, or how other countries may retaliate.

Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz wrote in a note on Tuesday, ""[We're] unlikely to see a material recovery in equities until we see the start of fiscal policy uncertainty abating,"" noting that a recent surge in economic policy uncertainty measures have coincided with the market's recent slide.

""Of course, that can happen in more than one way,"" Kantrowitz added.

""We can either be more certain of tariff policies that will be implemented, or Trump can slow the pace or roll back some of his actions.""

Oops, something went wrong

Hopes for an IPO bonanza in the first year of the new Trump era are being put to the test.

Several tech companies — including Al cloud provider CoreWeave and the buy now, pay later app Klarna — are setting out to go public sometime over the second quarter.

But those plans could change if the stock market's recent whipsaw movements persist. Customer service software provider Gensys has already postponed its plans to go public in April or May, according to a report from the Information.

Some companies that have tested the public markets so far this year have experienced setbacks. One is Venture Global Inc. (VG), a liquefied natural gas exporter that watched its stock fall roughly 60% since a January listing.

""The early IPOs that we have seen ... haven't really given a vote of confidence for other companies to follow,"" Brianne Lynch, EquityZen head of market insight, told Yahoo Finance, citing the example of Venture Global.

""I think a lot of investors are hoping a Big Tech company like CoreWeave could be the one to reverse that trend because, certainly, we aren't seeing strong IPO traction yet.""

The good news for Wall Street is that, so far this year, the total value of US IPOs is up 62%, according to Dealogic, hitting $10 billion as of March 11. The number of deals has nearly doubled, to 63 from 33 during the same period in 2024.

But those results are still well short of 2021, the last boom year for dealmaking. The value of 2025's IPO deals so far is on track to underperform the average year of the past decade, while the number of deals so far is higher.

“Right now, our outlook is a little bit negative,” Avery Marquez, a portfolio manager for IPO-focused ETF provider Renaissance Capital, told Yahoo Finance. “We've got a little bit more caution than we did at the beginning of the year, but I think we're very heartened by the fact that we're still seeing companies filing.”

At the beginning of the year, bankers were wildly optimistic that the Trump administration's pro-growth agenda and deregulatory stance would unleash the market's animal spirits and spur a flurry of US deals handled by big Wall Street banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS).

But the uncertainty surrounding the administration's trade policies is roiling markets and raising new concerns about the direction of the US economy and inflation, likely making it tougher for bankers and executives to pull the trigger on a public listing.

""There were a lot of big expectations for the first quarter,” said David Konrad, a Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst who covers money center and investment banks. But now, he said, “it's very difficult to price an IPO when we're getting these swings in the market.”

Goldman CEO David Solomon told Fox Business on Wednesday that he still expects IPOs to rise this year.

""There is potential, especially if we got more specific actions on the regulatory front, to unleash more animal spirits,"" he said.

A major IPO to watch in the coming weeks or months is CoreWeave, a startup that provides data center infrastructure to the likes of Microsoft and Nvidia. It is proving to be integral to the booming needs created by tech companies' artificial intelligence efforts.

It filed for an IPO in late February and aims to raise about $4 billion at an expected target valuation of more than $35 billion, according to a Bloomberg report.

CoreWeave's IPO is being led by Morgan Stanley (MS), JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs, along with 11 other advisers.

Nvidia is both a big backer and client to the company. So is ChatGPT creator OpenAI. This week, CoreWeave struck a $11.9 billion contract with OpenAI that included CoreWeave's services, along with a private stake in the company.

One challenge ahead for a CoreWeave IPO is that investors are beginning to reset the big bets they've made on the future of AI growth.

Companies like CoreWeave seeking to go public are weighing their recent concerns of market volatility against how quickly their private capital and insider demands for payouts need to be replenished, according to Renaissance's Marquez.

“Normally, when you have a sell-off like the one that we've been having, in addition to just volatility and macro uncertainty, you're seeing headlines of companies pumping the brakes, killing their IPO plan,” he said.

But ""that just isn't the case right now,"" Marquez added.

However, Lynch of EquityZen expects that valuable startups considering their next move are content to grow in the private markets while they ""wait out the volatility.""

""It's questionable when these IPOs might happen,"" she added.

 “Tariff noise” will likely continue pressuring global and cryptocurrency markets until after April 2, limiting investor risk appetite, a Nansen analyst told Cointelegraph. 

The European Union's latest retaliatory tariffs have deepened macroeconomic uncertainty, prompting crypto analysts to forecast increased volatility for Bitcoin prices, which may drop below the critical $75,000 support level.

The EU will impose counter-tariffs on 26 billion euros ($28 billion) worth of US goods starting in April, the European Commission announced on March 12, responding to US President Donald Trump's recent move to impose 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.

This move is the latest retaliatory tariff announcement in response to US import tariffs, which may trigger renewed trade war concerns and market volatility in the near term.

“Counter tariffs aren't a positive signal as they suggest a potential bounce back from the other side again,” according to Marcin Kazmierczak, co-founder and chief operating officer of blockchain oracle solution firm, RedStone.

This may see Bitcoin (BTC) revisit $75,000, he told Cointelegraph, adding that “given stablecoins and RWAs [real world assets] remain at all-time-highs, it has the potential to rebound.”

“I don't believe that news will have a strong impact for now, but we'll observe the response on the US end,” he added.

Other analysts still eye a temporary Bitcoin retracement below $72,000 as part of a “macro correction” during the current bull market cycle before Bitcoin's next leg up.

Still, import tariffs are not the only factor influencing Bitcoin's price, Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, told Cointelegraph, adding:

Europe announced its retaliatory tariffs the same day Trump's increased 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports took effect. Europe's current suspension of tariffs on US goods will end on April 1, and its new tariffs will take full effect by April 13.

Traditional and cryptocurrency markets may be limited by tariff-related concerns until April 2, according to Aurelie Barthere, principal research analyst at Nansen.”

“That said, we observed tentative stabilization in the major US equity indexes and BTC yesterday, at the low of their respective RSI, which we are monitoring,” she added.

Trump threatened to “substantially increase” duties on cars entering the US from Canada, set to take effect on April 2, unless Canada decides to drop some of its trade tariffs.

 Bitcoin's bounce off $76,606 is facing selling near $85,000, but there are early signs that the selling pressure could be reducing, and a bottom may be nearby. 

Bitcoin (BTC) bounced from $76,606 on March 11, but the bulls could not sustain the price above $84,500 on March 12. 

Nansen principal research analyst Aurelie Barthere told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin is in a macro correction in a bull market, with the next crucial level being “$71,000-$72,000, top of the pre-election trading range.”

Glassnode also projected a similar target in its March 11 market report. The onchain analytics firm said the recent sell-off had been triggered by the short-term holders who may have purchased near the peak in January. Glassnode added that Bitcoin could bottom out near $70,000 if selling persists.

It is not only the crypto markets; even the US stock market has been under pressure in the past few days. However, a silver lining for the bulls is that the US Dollar Index (DXY) has corrected from its multi-year high above 110 to under 104. Bitcoin generally moves in inverse correlation with the dollar, suggesting that a bottom may be around the corner.

Could Bitcoin retest the support at $76,606 or rise above $85,000? What are the important support and resistance levels to watch out for in altcoins? Let's analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.

Bitcoin broke below the $78,258 level on March 10 and fell to $76,606 on March 11, but the bears could not sustain the lower levels. This suggests solid buying by the bulls.

The relief rally is facing selling near the 20-day exponential moving average ($87,262), but a minor positive in favor of the bulls is that the relative strength index (RSI) is showing a positive divergence. Buyers will have to drive the price above the 20-day EMA to suggest that the correction could be ending. The BTC/USDT pair may then ascend to the 50-day simple moving average ($94,654).

On the downside, the bulls are expected to defend the $73,777 level with all their might because a break below it may sink the pair to $67,000.

Ether (ETH) fell below the $1,993 support on March 9 and extended the decline, reaching $1,754 on March 11.

The bulls are trying to start a recovery, which is expected to face significant resistance at the breakdown level of $2,111. If the price turns down sharply from $2,111, it will signal that the bears have flipped the level into resistance. That heightens the risk of a break below $1,754. The ETH/USDT pair may then slump to $1,500.

Conversely, a break above the 20-day EMA ($2,235) suggests that the markets have rejected the break below $2,111. The pair may then climb to $2,800, where the bears are expected to step in.

XRP (XRP) fell below the $2 support on March 11, but the bears could not sustain the lower levels, as seen from the long tail on the candlestick.

The bears are trying to stall the recovery at the 20-day EMA ($2.35). If the price continues lower, the possibility of a break below $2 increases. If that happens, the XRP/USDT pair will complete a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern. There is minor support at $1.77, but if the level cracks, the decline could extend to $1.28.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price breaks above the 20-day EMA, the pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($2.58) and later to $3. 

BNB (BNB) turned up from $507 on March 11, indicating that the bulls are aggressively defending the $500 to $460 support zone.

The relief rally is expected to face selling at the 20-day EMA ($592). If the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, the bears will try to sink the BNB/USDT pair below $500. The pair may drop to $460 if they can pull it off.

Instead, if the price rises above the 20-day EMA, it will signal that the pair may remain inside the $460 to $745 range for a while longer. The bulls will be back in the driver's seat on a break and close above the 50-day SMA ($628).

Solana (SOL) turned up from $112 on March 11, signaling that the bulls are fiercely defending the $110 support.

The RSI shows early signs of forming a positive divergence, indicating that the bearish momentum could weaken. The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the 20-day EMA ($145). 

If the price turns down from the current level or the 20-day EMA, it suggests that every minor rally is being sold into. That increases the risk of a break below $110. The SOL/USDT pair could tumble to $98 and subsequently to $80.

Cardano (ADA) rebounded off the uptrend line on March 11, suggesting that the bulls are trying to stop the decline.

ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

The bears are unlikely to give up easily and are expected to sell at the moving averages. If the price turns down from the moving averages, it will signal selling on rallies. The bears will then try to strengthen their position by pulling the price below the uptrend line. If they do that, the ADA/USDT pair could drop to $0.60 and then to $0.50.

Contrary to this assumption, a break and close above the moving averages suggests that the bulls are back in the game. The pair may then rally to $1.02.

Dogecoin (DOGE) continued its slide and reached the $0.14 support on March 11. The bulls are trying to defend the level but may face selling at higher levels.

DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA ($0.20), it will suggest that the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on rallies. That increases the risk of a break below $0.14. The DOGE/USDT pair may descend to $0.10 if that happens.

On the contrary, a break and close above the 20-day EMA suggests that the bears are losing their grip. The pair could climb to the 50-day SMA ($0.25), which may pose a solid challenge again.

Pi (PI) is taking support at the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $1.20, indicating buying at lower levels.

PI/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

The relief rally is expected to face resistance at the 20-day EMA ($1.69) and then again at $2. If the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the PI/USDT pair could range between $2 and $1.20 for some time.

A break and close above $2 suggests that the correction may be over. The pair could rally to $2.40. Alternatively, a break and close below $1.20 could sink the pair to the 78.6% retracement level of $0.72.

UNUS SED LEO (LEO) has been consolidating just below the $10 level for several days, indicating that the bulls are holding on to their positions as they anticipate another leg higher.

LEO/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

The LEO/USD pair has formed an ascending triangle pattern, which will complete on a break and close above $10. If that happens, the pair could resume the uptrend toward the target objective of $12.04.

This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the uptrend line. That will negate the bullish setup, starting a drop to $8.84 and later to $8.30.

Hedera (HBAR) bounced off the $0.17 support on March 11, indicating that the bulls are aggressively defending the level.

HBAR/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

The recovery is facing selling at the 20-day EMA ($0.22), as seen from the long wick on the candlestick. If the price continues lower, the bears will make one more attempt to sink the HBAR/USDT pair below $0.17. If they succeed, the pair could plunge to $0.12.

Contrarily, a break above the 20-day EMA suggests that the selling pressure is reducing. The pair could rise to the downtrend line, which is an important level to watch out for. If buyers push the price above the downtrend line, the pair could rally to $0.29.

 Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said the SEC's decision delays on a slew of crypto ETFs are standard procedure and won't affect their likely approval. 

The US Securities and Exchange Commission has delayed its decision to approve several XRP, Solana, Litecoin and Dogecoin exchange-traded funds.

In a slew of filings on March 11, the agency said it has “designated a longer period”  to decide on the proposed rule changes that would allow the ETFs to proceed.

Among the affected ETFs are Grayscale's XRP (XRP) and Cboe BZX Exchange's spot Solana (SOL) ETF filings, with the decisions on them pushed until May.

Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said in a March 11 X post that while the SEC just “punted on a bunch of altcoin ETF filings,” he didn't see it as a cause for concern. “It's expected, as this is standard procedure.” 

He added that US President Donald Trump's pick to chair the SEC, Paul Atkins, “hasn't even been confirmed yet.”

“This doesn't change our (relatively high) odds of approval. Also note that the final deadlines aren't until October,” Seyffart said.

Fellow Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas also chimed in, saying that “everything [is] delayed,” including ETFs featuring Ether (ETH) staking and in-kind redemptions.

In early December, Trump picked pro-crypto businessman and former SEC Commissioner Atkins to be the agency's next chair. However, congressional confirmation hearings are yet to be scheduled.

This is not the first time the SEC has extended an ETF decision deadline. On Feb. 28, it extended the deadline for Cboe Exchange's request to list options tied to Ether (ETH) ETFs.

This followed the SEC receiving a raft of altcoin ETF filings in the wake of Trump's election and the resignation of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler.

Gensler's time at the SEC came with what the industry said was an aggressive regulatory stance toward crypto, with 100 crypto-related regulatory actions during his tenure from 2021 until his resignation on Jan. 20.

Since Gensler's departure, a growing number of firms facing legal action from the regulator have had their cases dismissed, including crypto exchange Gemini on Feb. 26 and crypto trading firm Cumberland DRW on March 4.

Meanwhile, acting SEC Chairman Mark Uyeda has also proposed abandoning part of a rule change that would have expanded regulation of alternative trading systems to include crypto firms.

 Bitcoin's “top buyers” are selling heavily, with onchain analytics firm Glassnode calling it a “moderate capitulation event.” 

Bitcoin buyers who purchased around when it hit a $109,000 all-time peak in January are now panic-selling as the cryptocurrency declines, says onchain analytics firm Glassnode, which isn't ruling out that Bitcoin could slide to $70,000.

Glassnode said in a March 11 markets report that a recent sell-off by top buyers has driven “intense loss realization and a moderate capitulation event.”

The surge in buyers paying higher prices for Bitcoin (BTC) in recent months is reflected in the short-term holder realized price — the average purchase price for those holding Bitcoin for less than 155 days.

In October, the short-term realized price was $62,000. At the time of publication, it's $91,362 — up about 47% in five months, according to Bitbo data.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin is trading at $81,930 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap. This leaves the average short-term holder with an unrealized loss of roughly 10.6%.

Glassnode said that short-term holders' realized price shows it is apparent that “market momentum and capital flows have turned negative, signaling a decline in demand strength.” 

“Investor uncertainty is affecting sentiment and confidence,” it added.

Glassnode said that short-term holders are “deeply underwater” between $71,300 and $91,900 and warns that Bitcoin could bottom out as low as $70,000 if selling persists.

“The probability of forming a temporary floor in this zone is meaningful, at least in the near term,” Glassnode said.

Market research firm 10x Research labeled it a “textbook correction” in a March 10 note, adding that with Bitcoin's dip below $80,000, “approximately 70% of all selling came from investors who bought within the last three months.”

On the same day, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said that Bitcoin may retest the $78,000 price level and, if that fails, may head to $75,000 next.

Glassnode explained that a similar sell-off Bitcoin pattern was seen in August when Bitcoin fell from $68,000 to around $49,000 amid fears of a recession, poor employment data in the United States, and sluggish growth among leading tech stocks.

However, Bitcoin has spiked 7.5% over the past 24 hours as the US market steaded on March 11 after plunging a day earlier after US President Donald Trump refused to rule out that a recession was on the cards.

 Bitcoin may get a price boost as the US debt suspension ends on March 14 and injects fresh liquidity into markets. Global trade tensions still pose potential risks. 

Bitcoin's next significant price catalyst may arrive Friday as the US debt suspension period comes to an end, potentially injecting fresh liquidity into markets and driving a price rebound.

The US Treasury hit its $36 trillion debt ceiling a day after President Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. A “debt issuance suspension period” began then and was set to last until March 14, according to a letter published on Jan. 17.

Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped 22% during the two-month debt suspension plan, from over $106,000 on Jan. 21 to $82,535 at the time of writing on March 12, TradingView data shows.

A resumption of government spending may bring a liquidity boost to catalyze Bitcoin's next rally, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research.

“With in-hand cash, the demand for financial assets such as stocks and crypto can increase, and there may be a relief from ongoing volatility,” the analyst told Cointelegraph. “In such periods, we can expect a boost in the overall momentum, although many other factors are important to note.”

Beyond global tariff uncertainty, “concerns such as inflation, interest rates and geopolitical issues remain unresolved,” Lee added.

Considering that the debt suspension will end just two weeks after the White House Crypto Summit, a portion of the new liquidity may flow into cryptocurrencies, according to Aleksei Ponomarev, co-founder and CEO of crypto index investing firm J'JO.

“Surges in liquidity have typically benefited Bitcoin and risk assets, and the end of the US debt suspension will be no different,” he told Cointelegraph, adding:

Bitcoin's right-hand side (RHS), which marks the lowest bid price for which someone is willing to sell the currency, may still face a potential correction to near $70,000 until the end of the debt suspension period on Friday, based on its correlation with the global liquidity index.

Still, the growing money supply could push Bitcoin price above $132,000 before the end of 2025, according to estimates from Jamie Coutts, chief crypto analyst at Real Vision.

While more global liquidity is an optimistic sign for Bitcoin, the world's first cryptocurrency remains limited by global trade tariff concerns, according to James Wo, the founder and CEO of venture capital firm DFG:

“Higher import costs and reduced corporate margins are likely to push inflation higher, forcing central banks to keep interest rates elevated for longer under a restrictive monetary policy,” he added.

This may also tighten liquidity conditions, making risk assets such as Bitcoin “less attractive in the short to medium term,” Wo said.

The European Union introduced retaliatory tariffs on March 12, threatening a Bitcoin correction below $75,000 in the short term. This may occur temporarily due to Europe accounting for over $1.5 trillion of annual US exports.

Despite the short-term correction concerns, most analysts remained optimistic about Bitcoin's price trajectory for late 2025, with price predictions ranging from $160,000 to above $180,000.

 All Ethereum holders across the network currently carry an average unrealized loss of 7% after ETH price fell below $2,000 for the first time since December 2023. 

Ethereum's native token, Ether (ETH), dropped below $2,000 on March 10, and the altcoin has struggled to regain a position above the psychological level. 

While Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP (XRP) exhibited minor recoveries over the past 24 hours, Ether prices failed to display bullish momentum in the charts. 

The altcoin plummeted to a multi-year low of $1,752 on March 11. However, onchain data and technical analysis indicate that the price could drop an additional 15% in the coming weeks. 

The current price deviation below $2,000 carried onchain implications for the altcoin. According to Glassnode, a data analytics platform, ETH dropped below its realized price of $2,054 for the first time since February 2023.

ETH realized price calculates the average price of each ETH last moved, representing the average cost basis of the total circulating supply. The current drop below the realized price indicates widespread unrealized loss for all ETH holders.  

The market value to realized value (MVRV) ratio also dropped to 0.93, indicating a 7% average loss for all ETH holders across the network. However, it is important to note that the realized price reflects the weighted average of all historical transactions. Hence, it encompasses the cost basis of every ETH holder, not a specific timeframe like 2023 to 2025.

Meanwhile, Ethereum's total value locked (TVL) dropped to a six-month low of $45.6 billion on March 12, down 41% from its peak of $77 billion on Dec. 17, 2024.

Additionally, the total fees users paid to use Ethereum fell to $46.28 million—the lowest level since July 2020—further signaling weakening network engagement.

In a recent X post, Glassnode explained how Ethereum's cost-basis distribution could be useful in identifying potential support levels for ETH. Based on a weekly outlook, Ether's recent drop below $1,880 led to an accumulation of 600,000-700,000 ETH around $1,900. The post states,

At the same time, anonymous analyst Ninja believes that the floor price for Ethereum remains between $1,600 and $1,900.

 Russia plans a three-year crypto trial for select investors under an experimental legal regime to regulate digital currencies and market transparency. 

The Russian central bank is considering a three-year experimental regime to authorize select Russian investors to trade cryptocurrencies.

On March 12, the Bank of Russia announced a proposal to allow a “limited circle of Russian investors” to buy and sell cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC).

“In accordance with the instructions of the President of Russia, the Bank of Russia has sent proposals to the government for discussion on regulating investments in cryptocurrencies,” the announcement stated.

While proposing to legalize crypto trading for investors with at least $1.1 million in securities and deposits, the Bank of Russia also suggested introducing penalties for violations of the experimental regime.

The central bank reiterated that other residents cannot settle payments using crypto.

The ban on using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for payments in Russia was part of the country's first crypto law, “On Digital Financial Assets,” which came into force in January 2021. In the new proposal, the central bank stated:

Despite banning residents from using crypto for payments in Russia, the Bank of Russia has been open about allowing cross-border settlements in crypto since at least 2022.

In December 2024, Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov confirmed that Russia has been actively experimenting with crypto in foreign trade in line with the country's legislation, referring to another experimental legal regime, which was enforced in September 2024.

The Bank of Russia's reasoning for introducing the new crypto program for limited investors came from efforts to increase the transparency of the local cryptocurrency market, the announcement noted.

According to the central bank, such a framework would introduce standards for crypto asset service providers in Russia and expand investment opportunities for experienced investors willing to take on increased risks.

“The Bank of Russia has repeatedly noted that private cryptocurrencies are not issued or guaranteed by any jurisdiction, based on mathematical algorithms and are subject to increased volatility,” the authority stated, adding:

In the announcement, the central bank said that it also proposed to allow qualified companies to become participants in the experiment.

“For financial institutions that want to invest in cryptocurrency, the Bank of Russia will establish regulatory requirements taking into account the level and nature of the risks of such an asset,” the authority stated.

By potentially allowing eligible Russian firms to invest in cryptocurrencies, the Bank of Russia may be paving the way for a “Russian MicroStrategy,” or a company that would be committed to buying large amounts of BTC following the lead of Michael Saylor's Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy.

A number of companies worldwide, including Elon Musk's Tesla, Japan's Metaplanet and Brazilian fintech unicorn Meliuz, have started purchasing BTC since Saylor's Strategy purchased its first coins in August 2020.

Outside the experimental regime, all qualified investors will be able to invest in derivative financial instruments — securities and digital financial assets that are tied to the value of cryptocurrency assets — the central bank said.

 Bitcoin is seeing a gradual return to buyer interest, but it is large-volume investors leading the way as others remain hesitant after weeks of downside. 

Bitcoin whales are back buying BTC while “panic” is keeping smaller investors away, according to new research.

Data from onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant shows sell-side pressure from Binance whales cooling.

Bitcoin (BTC) at $80,000 is proving attractive for large-volume investors, or at least a poor value selling proposition for those wishing to exit the market.

In a “Quicktake” blog post on March 12, CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost revealed that the proportion of the top 10 largest inflows to Binance attributed to whales has declined.

“Monitoring whale behavior has consistently provided valuable insights into potential market movements,” they summarized.

The exchange's whale ratio has, in fact, exhibited a broad downtrend since mid-January when BTC/USD hit its latest all-time highs.

“Currently, this ratio is declining, implying that Binance's whales are reducing their selling pressure,” the post continued. 

As Cointelegraph reported, both whales and larger entities holding at least 10 BTC have begun to accumulate coins this month, albeit at modest rates.

Overall appetite for BTC exposure nonetheless remains suppressed.

In the latest edition of its regular newsletter, “The Week Onchain,” analytics firm Glassnode pointed to lackluster demand at current prices.

It referenced capital flows by short-term holders (STHs) — speculative entities holding coins for up to six months. Within this cohort, buyers holding between one week and one month now have a lower cost basis than those holding for between one and three months.

“With Bitcoin prices dropping below $95k, this model also confirmed a transition into net capital outflows, as the 1w–1m cost basis fell below the 1m–3m cost basis,” the researchers explained.

 After rolling out US dollar payment support for institutional customers in the UK and Switzerland, Gemini plans to scale the feature across the EU and the EEA in coming weeks. 

Gemini crypto exchange, founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, is expanding its trading capabilities for institutional clients in Europe by introducing US dollar payment support

Gemini has partnered with Liechtenstein-based Bank Frick to enable US dollar payment rails for institutional customers in the United Kingdom and Switzerland, the firm said in an announcement shared with Cointelegraph on March 12.

“We plan to expand our rollout of USD rail support to our European Union institutional customers in the next few weeks,” said Gemini's head of Europe, Mark Jennings.

The new functionality will also be available to Gemini's institutional users in Gibraltar, Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man.

Gemini's new US dollar feature — also coming to some countries in the European Economic Area — will enable institutions to deposit and withdraw US dollars to and from their Gemini accounts with no fees.

The functionality will also enable institutions to access US dollar-to-crypto trading pairs and directly trade with US dollars on Gemini, rather than having to convert to the British pound or euros, removing friction, Jennings told Cointelegraph, adding:

For deposits, Gemini will utilize Bank Frick's instant transfer service called xPulse, which will provide a 24/7 fiat on-ramp for institutional customers who have a Bank Frick bank account, the firm noted.

According to Jennings, Gemini's new functionality will be available directly on the platform through its own entities that have received Electronic Money Institution (EMI) licenses.

“Unlike most CASPs [crypto asset service providers] that rely on partnerships for funding rails due to the lack of an EMI license, our regulatory-first approach allows us to provide seamless funding solutions directly through our own EMI-licensed entities,” the exec told Cointelegraph.

It is unclear how widespread US dollar trading support is among other European crypto exchanges and service providers.

Major crypto exchange Coinbase introduced US dollar trading pairs for European customers in 2019 for Coinbase Pro and Prime customers. The exchange halted its Pro service in 2023.

The news comes soon after Gemini reportedly submitted a confidential filing for an initial public offering (IPO) in the United States.

According to Bloomberg's sources, Gemini's IPO may be launched as soon as this year and would involve companies like Goldman Sachs and Citigroup.

Gemini has been working to go public since at least 2021 and reportedly considered a merger with the now-bankrupt venture capital firm Digital Currency Group.

 On March 11, Franklin Templeton became the ninth firm to file for an XRP ETF, though giants like BlackRock have yet to join the race. 

American asset manager Franklin Templeton has entered the growing XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) race, becoming the latest firm to file for a spot XRP ETF in the United States.

Franklin Templeton's XRP (XRP) ETF is designed to track the performance of the XRP price, with XRP holdings stored at Coinbase Custody Trust, according to an official filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on March 11.

On the same day, the SEC postponed decisions on multiple crypto ETF filings, including Grayscale's proposal to convert its XRP Trust into an ETF.

Despite the growing XRP ETF filing frenzy, BlackRock — issuer of the largest spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF — has yet to submit a filing for an XRP-based product.

As of March 12, nine companies have filed for XRP ETF products in the US, including major issuers like Bitwise, ProShares, 21Shares and others.

Bitwise, one of the world's largest crypto funds managers, was the first firm to submit a Form S-1 filing for an XRP ETF on Oct. 2, 2024.

Canary Capital subsequently followed, filing a Form S-1 for a similar product on Oct. 8, 2024.

Switzerland-based crypto investment firm 21Shares and US ETF provider WisdomTree also filed for XRP ETFs in late 2024, with filings coming in November and December, respectively.

Asset manager ProShares joined the XRP ETF race in 2025 by filing for several XRP ETF products with the SEC on Jan. 17, including the ProShares XRP ETF and three additional XRP investment products.

Another XRP ETF filing came from the European crypto investment firm CoinShares in January, with Grayscale proposing to convert its XRP Trust into an XRP ETF trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Jan. 30.

Volatility Shares, a Florida-based financial services firm founded in 2019, also filed three XRP ETF products on March 7, including the Volatility Shares XRP ETF, the Volatility Shares 2x XRP ETF and the Volatility Shares -1x XRP ETF.

Beyond dedicated XRP ETF filings, at least two asset managers have included XRP in broader crypto ETF products.

On Jan. 21, asset manager REX-Osprey filed for an “ETF Opportunities Trust,” which includes seven ETFs tracking assets including major coins such as XRP and Bitcoin, as well as memecoins like Bonk (BONK) and Official Trump (TRUMP).

Similarly, Tuttle Capital Management submitted an ETF opportunities trust filing, including 10 daily target ETFs, covering assets such as XRP and Melania (MELANIA).

 A bipartisan majority in the US House of Representatives voted to repeal the so-called IRS DeFi broker rule. 

The US House of Representatives has voted in favor of nullifying a rule that would have required decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to report to the Internal Revenue Service.

On March 11, the House of Representatives voted 292 for and 132 against a motion to repeal the so-called IRS DeFi broker rule that aimed to expand existing IRS reporting requirements to crypto.

All 132 votes to keep the rule were Democrats. However, 76 of those in the party joined the Republican vote to repeal it. 

This follows the US Senate's March 4 vote on the motion to repeal, which saw it pass with a vote of 70 to 27.

The rule would force DeFi platforms, such as decentralized exchanges, to disclose gross proceeds from crypto sales, including information regarding taxpayers involved in the transactions.

Speaking after the vote, Republican Representative Mike Carey, who submitted the repeal motion, said, “The DeFi broker rule invades the privacy of tens of millions of Americans, hinders the development of an important new industry in the United States and would overwhelm the IRS.”

House Financial Services Committee Chairman French Hill also applauded the overturning of the rule, calling it “a clear example of government overreach that threatens to push American digital asset development overseas.”

The resolution will need to pass another Senate vote before being sent to President Donald Trump, who has signaled he'd support it.

Those opposing the rule repeal included Democrat Representative Lloyd Doggett, who said getting a “special interest exemption” from IRS disclosures “makes tax evasion and money laundering so much easier for wealthy Republican donors who have been using these decentralized exchanges.”

He claimed killing the rule would create a “loophole that would be exploited by wealthy tax cheats, drug traffickers and terrorist financiers.”

In early March, White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks said the administration would support congressional efforts to rescind the DeFi broker rule.

At the time, officials from the Office of Management and Budget wrote, “This rule … would stifle American innovation and raise privacy concerns over the sharing of taxpayers' personal information while imposing an unprecedented compliance burden on American DeFi companies.”

 The US government has long relied on gold and oil as reserve assets, but with the growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin (BTC), its potential role as a strategic reserve has increased substantially. This possibility and potential of the Bitcoin strategic reserve have seen a major tailwind as the new administration took charge in the US in January 2025.While gold has historically backed monetary systems and oil remains a key economic and security asset, Bitcoin represents a new kind of digital reserve that challenges traditional financial paradigms. The United States holds substantial reserves in gold and oil, but its Bitcoin holdings are comparatively small and primarily acquired through asset seizures. As of the third quarter of 2024, the US holds approximately 8,133.46 metric tons of gold, valued at around $789. 87 billion (on March 8, 2025), making it the largest sovereign holder of gold reserves. These reserves have historically been used as a hedge against economic uncertainty and to back the dollar before the gold standard was abandoned in 1971.In the case of oil, the US maintains a Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), which, as of August 2024, holds around 372 million barrels. The SPR was established in the 1970s in response to the oil crisis and is valued at approximately $28 billion at current market prices. These reserves manage supply disruptions, control inflationary pressures, and stabilize energy markets during geopolitical crises.Bitcoin, unlike gold and oil, is not an official reserve asset, but the US government possesses a significant amount through confiscations.

 Gold, oil and Bitcoin each exhibit unique liquidity and market dynamics, with gold being the stablest, oil driven by geopolitical factors and Bitcoin characterized by high volatility and 24/7 accessibility.The depth of liquidity of an asset in a market is an extremely important indicator of the asset's health. Typically, the higher the liquidity, the better the options investors have around pricing and risk management. Let's understand how gold, oil and Bitcoin differ from each other in terms of liquidity and market dynamics:Gold: It remains one of the most liquid financial assets, with daily trading volumes exceeding $200 billion across futures markets, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and over-the-counter (OTC) trades. Its deep liquidity and universal recognition make it a preferred asset for central banks, institutional investors and governments looking to hedge against inflation and currency fluctuations. While gold's price varies, it has historically maintained lower volatility than most other assets.Oil: It is traded at immense volumes in both spot and futures markets, with daily future volumes reaching about 1 million barrels globally. Unlike gold, oil's liquidity is largely tied to its industrial demand and geopolitical developments. The price of oil is highly sensitive to supply chain disruptions, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) decisions and macroeconomic policies. Given its role in energy markets, oil volatility is much higher than gold, with price swings that can result from political instability, production cuts or major conflicts.Bitcoin: Bitcoin, despite being a relatively new asset, is highly liquid, with daily trading volumes often exceeding $30 billion–$50 billion across global exchanges. While BTC has gained legitimacy among institutional investors, it remains significantly more volatile than gold and oil due to speculative demand, regulatory uncertainty and market structure. Unlike gold and oil, Bitcoin operates on a 24/7 trading cycle, making it unique in terms of accessibility and global liquidity.

 Storage and security concerns are crucial for any reserve asset, with each asset presenting unique challenges and costs.Gold: It is typically stored in highly secure facilities such as Fort Knox, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and other vaults worldwide. The cost of storing gold varies, but large-scale sovereign reserves require substantial security infrastructure, transportation costs and insurance. Additionally, physical gold is vulnerable to theft and requires constant auditing to ensure authenticity and weight accuracy. Plus, custody fees for institutions storing gold in vaults range from 0.10% to 0.50% per year, depending on the storage provider.Oil: Unlike gold and Bitcoin, oil presents logistical challenges as it must be stored in underground salt caverns, refineries or tanker fleets. The cost of maintaining the Strategic Petroleum Reserve requires billions of dollars in infrastructure, maintenance and security. Moreover, oil storage is subject to depreciation due to environmental conditions, evaporation and contamination risks, making it more expensive to maintain than gold or Bitcoin.Bitcoin: Bitcoin storage differs fundamentally, as it is a digital asset. Governments and institutions typically use cold storage wallets and multisignature security to protect their holdings. While Bitcoin custody does not require physical storage facilities, cybersecurity risks such as hacking, private key mismanagement and regulatory oversight present major challenges. Institutional-grade custody solutions like BitGo, Fireblocks and Coinbase Custody charge anywhere from 0.05% to 0.25% per year, significantly lower than gold storage costs. However, the irreversibility of Bitcoin transactions increases the risks associated with mismanagement or unauthorized access. 

Storage and security concerns are crucial for any reserve asset, with each asset presenting unique challenges and costs.

 Gold, oil and Bitcoin each play strategic roles in global economics, with gold as a hedge, oil influencing geopolitical stability, and Bitcoin emerging as a decentralized asset for inflation protection.All of these assets have gained strategic and macroeconomic significance over time. Their narrative with relevance to the broader capital markets is perhaps what is needed to drive investors' interest. Gold: Gold's strategic role in the global economy dates back thousands of years, serving as a universal store of value and a medium of exchange. The US formally tied its currency to gold in the Bretton Woods system (1944–1971), which established the dollar as the world's reserve currency backed by gold. Even after the US abandoned the gold standard in 1971, gold remained a key strategic asset held by central banks worldwide as a hedge against currency devaluation and inflation.Oil: It has evolved into an indispensable economic and security asset, with its price fluctuations directly impacting inflation, consumer spending and geopolitical stability. The formation of OPEC in 1960 and the subsequent oil crises in the 1970s demonstrated oil's ability to drive inflation and shape economic policy. The petrodollar system, in which oil transactions are settled in US dollars, has further solidified oil's role in global finance, ensuring sustained demand for the dollar and influencing US foreign policy.Bitcoin: BTC's potential as a reserve asset lies in its decentralized nature, fixed supply (21 million BTC) and resistance to monetary debasement. Unlike gold and oil, which require extensive infrastructure, Bitcoin can be transferred globally in minutes and stored at near-zero cost. As institutional adoption grows, Bitcoin's strategic value as a hedge against inflation and government debt is increasingly recognized.

 Policy moves suggest that the establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve could position it alongside traditional assets like gold and oil in the future.In January 2025, President Donald Trump signed an executive order titled “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology,” establishing the Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets to explore the creation of a national digital asset stockpile. Building upon this initiative, on March 7, President Trump signed another executive order to create a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and a “US Digital Asset Stockpile,” aiming to position the US as a leader in the cryptocurrency space. These reserves will be funded exclusively through cryptocurrencies seized during law enforcement operations, ensuring no taxpayer funds are utilized.However, the reserve will be funded using cryptocurrencies already held by the government, primarily obtained through asset forfeitures rather than through new government purchases.This strategy has had mixed reactions. While some view it as a positive step toward embracing digital assets, others express concern over the lack of new investments and the potential implications of using forfeited assets. As of March 10, 2025, Bitcoin's value declined by more than 5% to approximately $79,515, reflecting market disappointment over the reserve's funding approach. Looking ahead, the US government's Bitcoin policy is likely to continue evolving. The Presidential Working Group is expected to provide recommendations by July 2025, which could influence future regulatory frameworks, investment strategies and the integration of digital assets into the broader financial system. As global interest in cryptocurrencies grows, the US may further refine its policies to balance innovation with security and economic stability alongside traditional assets such as gold and oil, which remain integral to the nation's financial strategy.

 A solo Bitcoin miner successfully mined Bitcoin block 887,212 using a pocket-sized Bitaxe machine and banked around $263,000. 

A solo Bitcoin miner using a relatively cheap, pocket-sized crypto mining rig has solved one of the blockchain's blocks and earned the full $263,000 reward.

The miner became the 297th solo miner to mine a Bitcoin block from the solo.ckpool Bitcoin (BTC) mining pool, its developer, Con Kolivas, said in a March 10 X post.

He added the miner used a 480-gigahash per second (GH/s) Bitaxe machine. For comparison, many big crypto-mining companies use machines that can operate at over 230,000 GH/s.

“A miner of this size has only less than a 1 in a million chance of finding a block per day, or put alternatively, would take 3,500 years to find a block on average,” Kolivas added.

The miner snared a total of 3.15 BTC for solving block 887,212, which was timestamped on March 10 at 7:22 pm UTC. That bounty includes the current 3.125 Bitcoin mining reward and another 0.025 Bitcoin from transaction fees, mempool.space data shows.

A 1,200 gigahash Bitaxe Gamma 601 machine, which is nearly three times more powerful than the one used by the solo miner, is priced at around $158, according to Bitcoin miner marketplace ASIC Miner Value.

ASIC Miner Value estimates that the Bitaxe Gamma 601 will make just over $20 a year while using around $18 worth of electricity, coming out to a yearly net profit of under $3.

It also states the odds of the Bitaxe Gamma 601 mining a solo block on any given day is one in 4.6 million, or one in 12,700 over a year.

Solo Bitcoin miners rarely solve blocks, let alone those with tiny mining rigs.

Most Bitcoin is mined from the larger pools such as Foundry USA — which obtains a large share of its hashrate from public Bitcoin miners like Cipher Mining, Bitfarms and Hut 8.

The largest public Bitcoin mining firm by market cap and hashrate, MARA Holdings, uses its own Bitcoin mining pool, MARA Pool.

While pocket-sized Bitcoin miners are hardly profitable, some of these micro miners are being built in an open-source manner to fight the “secrecy and exclusivity” of the Bitcoin mining industry, one of the builders of Bitaxe miners, “Skot,” told Cointelegraph in a September 2023 interview.

Most Bitcoin miners, such as those made by Bitmai,n are closed-sourced, which runs contrary to Bitcoin's ethos, Skot said.

 Centralized stablecoins feature all the hallmarks of a central bank digital currency, including the ability of the issuer to freeze tokens. 

The recent GENIUS stablecoin bill is merely a thinly veiled attempt to usher in central bank digital currency (CBDC) controls through privatized means, according to Jean Rausis, co-founder of the Smardex decentralized trading platform.

In a statement shared with Cointelegraph, Rausis said that the US government will punish stablecoin issuers that do not comply with the new regulatory framework, similar to the European Union Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations. The executive added:

“With stablecoins under the government's control, the result is the same, with the false veneer of decentralization added as a bonus,” the executive continued.

Decentralized alternatives to centralized stablecoins, such as algorithmic stablecoins and synthetic dollars, will prove to be a valuable bulwark against this creeping government control over crypto, Rausis concluded.

The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, introduced by Tennessee Senator Bill Hagerty on Feb. 4, proposed a comprehensive framework for overcollateralized stablecoins such as Tether's USDt (USDT) and Circle's USDC (USDC).

The bill was revamped to include stricter Anti-Money Laundering, reserve requirements, liquidity provisions and sanctions checks on March 13.

These additional provisions will presumably give US-based stablecoin issuers an edge over their offshore counterparts.

During the recent White House Crypto Summit, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the US would use stablecoins to ensure US dollar hegemony in payments and protect its role as the global reserve currency.

Centralized stablecoin issuers rely on US bank deposits and short-term cash equivalents such as US Treasury bills to back their digital fiat tokens, which drives up demand for the US dollar and US debt instruments.

Stablecoin issuers collectively hold over $120 billion in US debt — making them the 18th-largest buyer of US government debt in the world.

 A blockchain firm that makes NFT skins for watches is suing TAG Heuer for alleged patent infringement. 

A company selling smartwatch face designs through non-fungible tokens has sued LVMH, accusing the luxury fashion conglomerate of patent infringement.

In a March 10 complaint filed to a Texas federal court, Watch Skins Corporation alleged that LVMH misappropriated its “pioneering NFT display technology.”

Watch Skins claimed it developed a unique system that allows users to display verified NFT artworks on smartwatches and holds multiple patents related to the technology.

It claimed that a smartwatch from the LVMH-owned watch brand TAG Heuer and other products from the conglomerate's brands unlawfully used NFT display technology that was based on three patents that Watch Skins owned.

LVMH is a multinational holding company that owns dozens of well-known luxury goods brands, including Louis Vuitton, Givenchy, TAG Heuer, Tiffany, Christian Dior, Hennessy and the champagne brand Moët & Chandon.

Watch Skins said its first patent covers a system that verifies NFT ownership before allowing it to be displayed on a watch face, the second one covers a system where an NFT must be verified through a blockchain wallet before being displayed on a smartwatch, and the third focuses on the retrieval and display of customized watch faces based on NFT ownership.

It claimed TAG Heuer encouraged customers to infringe on the patents by providing instructions on how to use its NFT display features.

“The watch allows the NFT to be displayed if owned by the user's crypto wallet [and] connects to a user's crypto wallet to guarantee authenticity of works displayed,” the complaint explained.

Watch Skins requested a jury trial and compensation for lost profits and royalties due to infringement and a court order preventing LVMH from further use of the patented technology.

The company announced the launch of the world's first blockchain NFT watch face marketplace at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in 2020. 

The mobile app gives consumers “the ability to purchase authentic, licensed smartwatch faces from their favorite brands,” Watch Skins stated at the time.

Cointelegraph has contacted LVMH for comment.

 The deal is the first institutional investment in the crypto exchange's eight-year history. 

Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX has invested $2 billion in cryptocurrency exchange Binance, potentially marking one of the biggest funding deals in the industry's history.

In a March 12 announcement, Binance said the transaction was the first institutional investment in the cryptocurrency exchange. Once finalized, the deal will be funded entirely through stablecoins.

Binance declined Cointelegraph's request to disclose what stablecoin was used in the transaction.  

The deal marks MGX's first foray into the cryptocurrency sector. The investment company has carved out a niche in emerging technology, with a focus on data centers, clean energy and AI.

By investing in Binance, MGX wants to “enable innovation at the intersection of AI, blockchain technology and finance,” the announcement said.

Binance is the world's largest crypto exchange based on users and daily transaction volumes. The company claims to have more than 260 million registered users. 

According to CoinMarketCap, there are 466 cryptocurrencies currently available on Binance. As Cointelegraph recently reported, the exchange is considering quality control changes to its listing process following the explosion of altcoins over the past year.

2025 is shaping up to be a strong year for crypto venture capital deals. In February, 137 crypto companies raised a cumulative $1.11 billion in funding, according to data from The TIE. 

After raising a combined $13.6 billion in 2024, crypto firms are expected to raise more than $18 billion this year, according to PitchBook. 

Much of that growth is tied to positive regulatory developments in the United States and the anticipation of more favorable financing conditions. 

“As we enter into a supportive macro environment driven by stimulative US policies and the formalization of crypto regulatory frameworks, these macro tailwinds are set to drive more VC investments heading into 2025,” HashKey Capital CEO Deng Chao told Cointelegraph.

 Aleksej Bešciokov was reportedly vacationing with his family in the Indian state of Kerala when authorities arrested him. 

Officials with India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) announced the arrest of Lithuanian national Aleksej Bešciokov, who was alleged to have operated the cryptocurrency exchange Garantex. 

In a March 12 notice, the CBI said police in the Indian state of Kerala had coordinated with national authorities to arrest Bešciokov. The Lithuanian national was reportedly vacationing in India with his family and planning to leave the country. The arrest of the alleged Garantex founder was based on US charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business and conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.

According to an indictment filed on Feb. 27 in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Bešciokov, Aleksandr Mira Serda and others operated Garantex to “launder the proceeds of criminal activity, including ransomware, computer hacking, narcotics transactions, and sanctions violations, and profited from the laundering” between 2019 to the present. Bešciokov is expected to be transferred to US custody in accordance with India's Extradition Act of 1962.

The alleged Garantex founder's arrest followed Tether's freezing of $27 million worth of USDt (USDT) on the platform. The crypto exchange announced on March 6 that it had temporarily suspended all services, including withdrawals. US authorities also seized three website domain names “used to support Garantex's operations” as part of a judge's order in the criminal case.

The US Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control added Garantex to its list of sanctioned entities in April 2022 for “willfully disregard[ing] Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) obligations and allow[ing] their systems to be abused by illicit actors.” The European Union also imposed sanctions against the platform in February as part of sanctions on “Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine.”

Serda, a Russian national and Garantex's co-founder and chief commercial officer, was seemingly still at large at the time of Bešciokov's arrest. 

A Garantex spokesperson declined to comment. 

It's unclear what legal recourse Bešciokov could have in fighting US extradition from India should he choose to do so. Lawyers for Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon, who was arrested in Montenegro in March 2023 on unrelated charges, repeatedly appealed court decisions regarding US extradition before he was finally handed over to officials in December 2024. 

Former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who was in the Bahamas when crypto exchange FTX collapsed in November 2022, was extradited from the island nation to the US to face charges. He was later convicted of seven felony counts and sentenced to 25 years in prison but filed an appeal.

 Emmer called CBDCs a “threat to American values” and reintroduced the Anti-Surveillance State Act to block a federal digital dollar. 

US Representative Tom Emmer argued for prioritizing pro-stablecoin legislation in a March 11 House Financial Services Committee hearing, while calling central bank digital currencies (CBDC) a threat to American values.

On March 6, Emmer reintroduced the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act in the House of Representatives. Emmer renewed his call for Congress to pass the legislation at the March 11 hearing. The legislation aims to block future administrations from launching a US CBDC without explicit approval from Congress.

“CBDC technology is inherently un-American,” Emmer said at the hearing, warning that allowing unelected bureaucrats to issue a CBDC “could upend the American way of life.”

On Jan. 23, President Donald Trump signed an executive order prohibiting “the establishment, issuance, circulation, and use” of a CBDC in the US. Emmer said that the legislation he reintroduced could “prevent a future administration from creating such an obvious tool for financial surveillance against its own citizens” if signed into law, citing concerns about privacy and financial independence.

At the same hearing, Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla urged lawmakers to create consistent stablecoin regulations across jurisdictions to avoid regulatory arbitrage. Paxos, a significant issuer of stablecoins, recommended clear guidelines and reciprocal rules with global regulators:

Emmer, a Minnesota Republican, also criticized inherent privacy risks associated with CBDCs, saying that stablecoins could bring traditional finance onchain at a global scale while reserving privacy:

 As Nigeria navigates its burgeoning cryptocurrency landscape, the government seeks to balance innovation with necessary regulation, aiming to build a secure, inclusive digital economy that empowers its citizens. 

Opinion by: Mohammed Idris, Minister of Information of Nigeria

Nigeria has emerged as one of the most active and dynamic crypto markets in recent years. From bustling tech hubs in Lagos to grassroots communities in smaller cities, young Nigerians have turned to cryptocurrencies to address fundamental economic challenges, from hedging against inflation to accessing global markets in a way traditional finance often does not allow.

As minister of information, I have seen firsthand how digital innovation has become crucial to the Nigerian story. Cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology and other digital assets are no longer on the fringes of our economy; they are fast becoming central to how our people transact, create and build.

This rise in crypto adoption has not, however, come without challenges. Questions around regulation, consumer protection, security and misuse of digital assets have fueled debates in Nigeria and globally. I write to clarify Nigeria's position: We are committed to fostering an inclusive digital asset ecosystem that is both innovative and responsible.

According to several international reports, Nigeria consistently ranks among the top countries in terms of crypto adoption. Our population — over 200 million strong, with a median age under 20 — is naturally inclined toward new technologies. Crypto has become more than a speculative tool; it's a lifeline for freelancers, small businesses and families receiving remittances.

Yet despite the widespread use of cryptocurrencies, Nigeria has wrestled with how to regulate this sector effectively. Earlier approaches included restrictions on financial institutions from facilitating crypto transactions, which inadvertently pushed much of the activity underground, away from proper oversight.

Under the administration of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Nigeria is reassessing its approach. We are moving away from blanket restrictions toward thoughtful, balanced regulation that acknowledges both the risks and the transformative potential of crypto and blockchain technologies.

Our objective is to create a regulatory framework that fosters innovation, ensures market integrity and protects Nigerian consumers. This involves active engagement with stakeholders from crypto startups and blockchain developers to international partners and regulatory bodies.

Nigeria's stance is simple. We support innovation that benefits our people, but we will not allow misuse that harms them.

We recognize the legitimate use cases for cryptocurrencies, including:

Financial inclusion for the unbanked and underbanked.

Cross-border payments and remittances that avoid high fees.

Access to global markets for Nigerian entrepreneurs and freelancers.

New digital economies, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), offer opportunities for wealth creation.

At the same time, we are determined to address concerns around fraud, money laundering, terrorism financing and other illicit activities. Effective regulation, rather than prohibition, is the path forward.

Nigeria sees blockchain technology as more than just crypto trading. Blockchain can be a powerful governance, transparency and service delivery tool.

Already, conversations are underway on how blockchain can improve public systems, such as:

Land registries to reduce fraud and strengthen property rights.

Identity management systems to enhance financial inclusion.

Supply chain monitoring to improve food security and public procurement.

Nigeria is not navigating this journey alone. As we develop new policies and frameworks, we look to global best practices and seek collaboration with international platforms and regulators.

We invite crypto companies, investors, innovators and advocates to engage with us. We aim to create a transparent and predictable environment where businesses can thrive while ensuring Nigerian citizens are protected from undue risks.

Nigeria's approach to crypto is evolving, and with good reason. The potential for digital assets and blockchain to contribute to economic growth, job creation and financial empowerment is too significant to ignore.

To realize these benefits, we must build trust in the system through effective regulation, education and international cooperation.

To the global crypto community, I say this: Nigeria is open to innovation, but we are equally committed to ensuring that such innovation operates within a secure, transparent and inclusive framework.

We look forward to working together — for the benefit of Nigerians and the global advancement of responsible crypto adoption.

 The key to the long-term survival of memecoins lies in adopting decentralized governance and moving beyond pure speculation. 

Opinion by: Sasha Ivanov, founder of Waves and Units.Network

Not long ago, the idea that an internet joke could become a multibillion-dollar asset class seemed laughable. Today, memecoins are not just mainstream. They are reshaping entire market cycles. The US now has an official memecoin associated with the president. What started as a niche community experiment has become a financial force too big to ignore.

This isn't simply speculation. In November 2024, memecoins accounted for 65% of the total trading volume on the decentralized exchange Raydium, an all-time high. Once dismissed as internet gimmicks, these assets have become crypto's cultural engine. This phenomenon has been causing a slight identity crisis for believers and skeptics, who need to rethink their positions. 

Whether viewed as the next retail-driven market movement or an unsustainable mania, one thing is clear: Memecoins are no longer a joke.

At their core, memecoins thrive on community belief. Traditional financial assets derive value from utility, institutional adoption or revenue models. Memecoins, by contrast, are driven by social engagement, virality and the power of collective momentum.

That makes them one of the most effective onboarding tools for retail investors in crypto. Memecoins strip away the complexity of blockchain technology, making digital assets approachable, familiar and culturally relevant. For many, they are the first step into Web3, opening the door to decentralized trading, governance and finance.

What makes them accessible, however, also makes them volatile. The same market mechanics that send memecoins soaring to billion-dollar valuations overnight can just as easily cause them to collapse within days. While one trader might turn $66 into a $3 million profit, thousands of others end up holding worthless tokens when the hype fades.

The numbers tell the story. When Elon Musk changed his X username and profile picture, a memecoin linked to him skyrocketed to a $380 million market cap. Once Musk reversed the changes, the coin plunged to $100 million before plummeting even further.

Recent: ‘Memecoins are archetypes of the collective unconscious' 

This is not an exception. This is the memecoin market in action. It is unpredictable, profit-driven and fueled by speculation. While some traders thrive in this environment, most do not. The skeptics argue that memecoins are little more than a casino with a blockchain — a game where few win and most lose.

Dismissing memecoins outright ignores a larger reality. Memecoins aren't going away, regardless of the skepticism. They are shaping market trends. The real question is: Can memecoins transition from hype-driven speculation to a structured financial asset with governance and longevity?

If memecoins are to evolve beyond short-term trading cycles, governance must take center stage. Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) offer a model that allows holders to shape token supply, enforce transparency and influence project direction to give memecoins a real shot at sustainability.

This structure prevents centralized control by developers and whales, reducing the risk of insider manipulation, exit scams and pump-and-dump schemes. It also ensures that memecoins can integrate treasury management, staking incentives and token supply models that promote long-term viability rather than short-lived speculation.

A prime example is Floki Inu (FLOKI), a memecoin that successfully built a functional ecosystem beyond meme-driven trading. Rather than relying on short-term speculation, Floki Inu integrated non-fungible token (NFT) gaming, payments and educational initiatives, proving that memecoins can evolve into structured, community-driven assets.

Memecoins don't need to abandon their cultural origins, but to survive beyond the current hype cycle, they must adopt governance mechanisms that promote economic sustainability.

Memecoins have divided the crypto space into two extreme camps. On one side, memecoin maximalists insist that this bull market will be dominated by memecoins, arguing that belief and virality alone are enough to sustain them. On the other, skeptics dismiss them entirely, viewing them as pump-and-dump schemes that will eventually implode.

Both perspectives miss the bigger picture. Memecoins have proven their ability to drive market activity, but ignoring their risks is just as reckless as dismissing them outright. The real challenge is not whether memecoins should exist. They already do. The question is how to structure them to ensure security for investors, stability for the market and long-term credibility for the industry.

Builders, regulators and communities must collaborate to balance decentralization and responsible governance. Ignoring memecoins as a passing trend would be shortsighted. Failing to address their risks could be even worse — potentially leading to a catastrophic collapse that damages public trust in crypto as a whole.

Memecoins are here to stay. The real test is whether they will remain a speculative rollercoaster or mature into a legitimate digital economy sector. The answer lies not just with traders but with the builders, developers and policymakers shaping blockchain's future.

 Bitcoin is showing signs of life but a prominent market cycle indicator is at the most bearish level “so far this cycle”, CryptoQuant says. 

Bitcoin has clocked a 7% gain over the past 24 hours despite all of its valuation metrics leaning bearish and US demand recently waning off.

“All Bitcoin valuation metrics indicate that we are in bearish territory,” onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant said in a March 11 markets report viewed by Cointelegraph. 

CryptoQuant said its Bitcoin Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator is at its “most bearish level' of this cycle, and Bitcoin's MVRV Ratio Z-score — a key metric to assess whether Bitcoin (BTC) is overvalued or undervalued — has crossed the 365-day moving average, “indicating that the upward price trend has lost momentum.”

At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $82,910, up from a 24-hour low of $79,356, according to CoinMarketCap data.

Bitcoin has spiked 7.5% over the past 24 hours as the US market steaded on March 11 after plunging a day earlier after US President Donald Trump refused to rule out that a recession was on the cards.

Most of Bitcoin's gains followed Senator Cynthia Lummis' reintroduction of the BITCOIN Act, which proposes that the US government buy 1 million BTC over five years.

However, some traders are not convinced that the downtrend is over.

Crypto analyst Bitcoin Rachy said in a March 11 X post, “Fake pump, right?” Similarly, crypto trader BitcoinHyper said in an X post, “Every pump feels like the beginning. This is how the market takes your money.”

Meanwhile, CryptoQuant said that Bitcoin's demand fell by 103,000 BTC last week compared to the previous week, “marking its fastest pace of contraction since July 2024.” 

CryptoQuant said the reason for the decline in Bitcoin's demand in the US recently was due to uncertainty around US inflation rates and US President Donald Trump's imposed tariffs on Feb. 1. On March 7, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell reiterated that he was in no hurry to adjust interest rates.

“Bitcoin demand remains in contraction territory, whales have slowed down their Bitcoin accumulation, and spot ETFs in the US have turned into net sellers of Bitcoin,” the firm said.

Bitcoin is still down 14% over the past month, and CryptoQuant says the drawdown is not “unusual in terms of magnitude, as similar corrections have occurred in past bull markets.”

However, it warned if Bitcoin that breaks its current support at the $75,000 to $78,000 price level, its next target could be as low as $63,000, a level not seen since Oct. 14.

Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten recently told Cointelegraph his forecast is that “there's more than 50% chance we will see all-time highs before the end of June this year.” Bitcoin's current all-time high of $109,000 was reached on Jan. 20.

 Securitize has selected the DeFi-focused RedStone as its oracle provider for current and future tokenized assets. 

Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization company Securitize has selected RedStone as the primary oracle provider for its tokenized products, which include BlackRock's USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) and the Apollo Diversified Credit Securitize Fund (ACRED).

According to a March 12 announcement, RedStone will deliver price feeds for current and future tokenized products offered by Securitize. As a DeFi-focused oracle provider, RedStone will purportedly expand the use cases of BUIDL and ACRED into money market exchanges and collateralized DeFi platforms, Securitize said.

RedStone provides crosschain data feeds for decentralized finance protocols on Ethereum, Avalanche and Polygon. According to DefiLlama data, it has amassed $4.3 billion in total value secured across all clients.

In July, RedStone raised $15 million in a Series A funding round led by Arrington Capital, with additional participation from Spartan, IOSG Ventures, HTX Ventures and others. 

Securitize selected RedStone as its oracle provider because of its “modular design,” which means it “can scale to thousands of chains and support new implementations in a matter of days,” RedStone chief operating officer Marcin Kazmierczak told Cointelegraph in a written statement. 

By using the RedStone oracle price feeds, Securitize's funds “can now be utilized across DeFi protocols such as Morpho, Compound or Spark,” he said.

Securitize co-founder and CEO Carlos Domingo told Cointelegraph that demand for tokenized funds is growing across a “diverse range of investors and users” spanning traditional finance and crypto-native firms.

“Institutional investors, private equity firms, and credit managers are turning to tokenization to enhance efficiency, reduce operational friction, and improve liquidity for private markets,” he said.

On the crypto-native side, companies “see tokenized RWAs as a secure and efficient way to manage treasury reserves while benefiting from stable yields,” said Domingo.

So far, the tokenization of private credit and US Treasury bonds have seen the largest uptake, according to industry data. The total market for onchain RWAs is approaching $18 billion, having grown by 16.8% over the past 30 days, according to RWA.xyz.

Separate data from Security Token Market showed that more than $50 billion worth of assets were tokenized by the end of 2024, with the majority coming from real estate. 

The tokenization market has attracted significant players in recent years, with the likes of Ondo Finance, Tradable and Brickken entering the fray.

 Senator Cynthia Lummis reintroduced the BITCOIN Act in the 119th Congress, bringing on new co-sponsors and changes to the landmark bill. 

US Senator Cynthia Lummis' newly reintroduced BITCOIN Act will allow the government to potentially hold more than 1 million Bitcoin as part of its newly established reserve.

The bill, first introduced in July, directs the US government to buy 200,000 Bitcoin (BTC) a year over five years for a total acquisition of 1 million Bitcoin, which would be paid for by diversifying existing funds within the Federal Reserve system and the Treasury department. 

However, the reintroduced act, the Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide (BITCOIN) Act of 2025, opens the door for the US to acquire and hold in excess of 1 million BTC as long as it is acquired through lawful means other than direct purchase, such as civil or criminal forfeitures, gifts made to the US or transfers from federal agencies.

The extra Bitcoin can also come from US states that voluntarily store their Bitcoin holdings in the strategic Bitcoin reserve, though it'll be stored in a segregated account. 

“By transforming the president's visionary executive action into enduring law, we can ensure that our nation will harness the full potential of digital innovation to address our national debt while maintaining our competitive edge in the global economy,” said Lummis, who announced the revamped bill during a March 11 conference hosted by The Bitcoin Policy Institute. 

The BITCOIN Act also has a number of new co-sponsors, including Republican Senators Jim Justice, Tommy Tuberville, Roger Marshall, Marsha Blackburn and Bernie Moreno. 

“I'm proud to join Senator Lummis on this common-sense bill to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve and codify President Trump's executive order,” Justice said in a statement. 

“This bill represents America's continued leadership in financial innovation, bolsters both our economic security, and gives us an opportunity to wrangle in our soaring national debt,” he added. 

The bill also now sets a formal evaluation process for Bitcoin forked assets and airdropped assets in the reserve. 

Initially, the bill required all forked assets to be stored in the reserve and couldn't be sold or disposed of for five years unless authorized by law.

The new bill now directs the Secretary after the mandatory holding period to evaluate and retain the most valuable asset based on market capitalization while retaining the “dominant asset.” 

Bitcoin has hard forked a number of times in the past to create new cryptocurrencies, most notably Bitcoin Cash (BCH), which forked on Aug. 1, 2017, and Bitcoin Gold (BTG), which forked on Oct. 24, 2017. 

Lummis' reintroduced bill comes just days after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and a “Digital Asset Stockpile.”

The reserve and stockpile will initially use cryptocurrency forfeited in government criminal and civil cases, but the reserve won't sell the stashed Bitcoin and will use “budget-neutral” ways to increase its size, while tokens from the stockpile could be sold.

	There's no clear quantum advantage yet in tests of real-world problems

A D-Wave quantum computer equipped with a quantum annealing processor (shown) tackled a real-world problem that would stymie a classical supercomputer, researchers claim.

D-Wave Quantum Inc.

2 hours ago

The tug-of-war between quantum computers and classical computers is intensifying.

In just minutes, a special quantum processor, called a quantum annealing processor, solved a complex real-world problem that a classical supercomputer would take millions of years to complete, researchers claim March 12 in Science. And that supercomputer, the team reports, would consume more energy to run the whole computation than the entire globe uses in a year. However, another group of researchers claims to have already found a way for a classical supercomputer to solve a subset of the same problem in just over two hours.

Quantum computers leverage principles of quantum mechanics to potentially offer huge advantages in processing power and speed compared with the classical computers we're familiar with in our daily lives. This capability theoretically allows quantum computers to tackle problems much faster than classical computers can.

The new, conflicting results follow similar claims made in recent years. The nascent field of quantum computing has been advancing in lockstep with techniques to make supercomputers more efficient, resulting in a closely matched rivalry. While quantum computers have demonstrated the ability to solve truly random problems faster than classical computers, they have yet to come out on top for physical problems relevant to real-world systems.

In the latest match-up, researchers at D-Wave Quantum Inc. in Burnaby, Canada, used a quantum computer equipped with a quantum annealing processor. Annealing processors differ from other, more typical quantum processors and have shown promise in conducting specific tasks. These processors are better equipped to tackle large problems because their quantum bits, or qubits, are coupled to many other qubits instead of just one, as in other types of quantum processors. But they are useful only for specific types of problems, such as optimization problems, and D-Wave's computers have attracted scientific skepticism in the past.

For the new result, the D-Wave researchers used a quantum annealing processor to simulate quantum dynamics by using arrays of magnetized disordered pieces known as spin glasses. This setup is relevant to materials science, where understanding the evolution of such systems can help in designing new metals.

“This is a simulation of magnetic materials,” says Mohammad Amin, chief scientist at D-Wave. “Magnetic materials are very important in industry and daily life,” appearing in devices such as cell phones, hard drives and specialized medical sensors.

The researchers simulated the evolution of such systems in two, three and infinite dimensions. After trying to solve the problem with approximations on a supercomputer, they concluded that it couldn't be done within a reasonable timeframe.

“It's a milestone result in quantum computing,” says Andrew King, a quantum computer scientist at D-Wave. “We've demonstrated quantum supremacy for the first time on an actual problem of real interest.”

Physicist Daniel Lidar, director of the quantum computing center at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, agrees that the D-Wave team hit a milestone. “It's very impressive work,” says Lidar, who was not involved in either study but works with a D-Wave device. “They really managed to perform quantum simulations on their hardware that are beyond the reach of current classical methods.”

But the claim isn't without controversy. King and his colleagues posted a preliminary draft of their paper about a year ago on arXiv.org, providing another group of researchers the opportunity to scrutinize the findings.

Quantum computer scientist Joseph Tindall of the Flatiron Institute in New York City and colleagues simulated part of the same problem using a classical computer. They developed a method that repurposed a 40-year-old algorithm called belief propagation, commonly used in artificial intelligence. Their results, submitted to arXiv.org on March 7 but not yet peer-reviewed, claim to be more accurate than the quantum computer's for certain cases of the two- and three-dimensional systems.

Sponsor Message

“For the … spin glass problem at hand, our classical approach demonstrably outperforms other reported methods,” the group writes in a draft of their study. “In [two cases] we are also able to reach errors noticeably lower than the quantum annealing approach employed by the D-Wave Advantage2 system.”

The classical simulations focused on only a subset of the D-Wave results, and the two groups are at odds as to whether the classical simulations can reproduce all the abilities of the quantum computer simulations, particularly for the three-dimensional system.

However, the quantum computer indisputably excelled with the infinite-dimensional system. Although not strictly physical, this system is useful for improving artificial intelligence. Simulating it classically would require an entirely different approach compared with the methods used for the two- and three-dimensional systems, Lidar says. Whether that can be done remains an open question.

	The face fossils date to as early as 1.4 million years ago

Reassembled upper jaw and cheek fossils found in a Spanish cave come from the oldest known human ancestors in Western Europe. Researchers date this facial find to between 1.4 million and 1.1 million years ago.

By Bruce Bower

2 hours ago

A Spanish cave has divulged the oldest known fossil remains of human ancestors in Western Europe.

Excavations at a site known as Sima del Elefante produced several fossil fragments that, when pieced together, form a partial left upper jaw and cheek bone dated to between 1.4 million and 1.1 million years old, say zooarchaeologist Rosa Huguet of the Catalan Institute of Human Paleoecology and Social Evolution in Tarragona, Spain, and colleagues.

That ancient midface comes from a previously unknown European Homo population, the researchers report March 12 in Nature.

“This discovery introduces a new actor in the story of human evolution in Europe,” Huguet said at a March 11 press briefing.

Some features of the jaw and cheek resemble those of Homo erectus individuals who reached a site called Dmanisi, in what's now the Southwest Asian nation of Georgia, around 1.8 million years ago. But not enough evidence exists to determine whether the new find qualifies as H. erectus or as a separate species, the investigators say.

Huguet's team digitally scanned each fossil fragment to create a virtual, 3-D version of the entire ancient midface. A mirror image of the reassembled left-side fossils was used to portray the right side of the virtual midface.

A lower jaw fossil previously unearthed at Sima del Elefante dates to between roughly 1.2 million to 1.1 million years ago and may have belonged to the same unnamed Homo species as the facial fossil, they suggest.

Hominid fossils excavated over the past 30 years at Gran Dolina, a cave located near Sima del Elefante, come from a species Huguet's group calls Homo antecessor, which lived between roughly 900,000 and 800,000 years ago. Vertically oriented, flat cheek bones of H. antecessor resemble those of people today, unlike the older Sima del Elefante face fossils.

Evolutionary ties between those two ancient European Homo species remain unclear. Members of the Sima del Elefante species — who also left behind a small collection of simple stone cutting or chopping tools — might have survived until shortly after the arrival of H. antecessor, the researchers say. In support of that scenario, animal bones and plant remains excavated in the same sediment as the ancient midface fossils reflect mild temperatures and a setting dotted with meadows, woods, shrubs and streams.

If recent evidence holds up of extreme cold temporarily driving hominid populations out of Europe shortly before 1.1 million years ago, then the Sima del Elefante Homo species may have died out before H. antecessor arrived, the scientists say.

Huguet's group presents a carefully reconstructed midface for one of the oldest known European hominids, says Harvard University biological anthropologist G. Philip Rightmire, who did not participate in the new study. He suspects, though, that the ancient Sima del Elefante crowd belonged to H. erectus.

Fossil remains of four H. erectus faces at Dmanisi display considerable variation in nasal structure and other midface traits, Rightmire says. One of those faces aligns closely with the Spanish midface discovery, he contends. After H. erectus left Africa, “I would put my money on a long-lasting regional [H. erectus] population occupying Dmanisi around 1.8 million years ago, with later populations moving into Europe,” Rightmire says.

Raising children may help your brain stay young.

A study of almost 38,000 adults finds that the more kids they had, the more synchronized the activity between certain brain regions became. The strongest association between the number of children and functional connectivity turned up in a brain network believed to aid in inferring others' thoughts, researchers report in the March 4 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Coordinated activity within this network typically decreases with age, suggesting that child-rearing — which involves learning new skills — may provide long-lasting protection against brain aging.

“It's very similar for males and females, so it's not that pregnancy effect; it's really a parenting effect,” says cognitive neuroscientist Edwina Orchard of the University of California, Santa Barbara.

Past brain-imaging research on parents often focused on how pregnancy changes the brain. But limiting child-rearing research to biological phenomena can overlook the environmental influences experienced by parents of all sexes.

While at Yale University, Orchard and her colleagues examined functional MRI scans of nearly 20,000 female and 18,000 male individuals who were middle-aged and older, using data from the U.K. Biobank database. As the number of kids parented went up, people of both sexes showed greater functional connectivity in the somatomotor network compared to those with fewer or no children. This network helps individuals interpret other people's behaviors and figure out their wants and needs — an important part of caregiving, Orchard says.

Parenthood may shift brain region coordination in the opposite direction of age-related decline by providing a complex and novel environment that lasts for decades, Orchard says. But raising kids is just one way to introduce complexity and novelty, she notes. Complicated jobs, higher education and learning a foreign language can also enrich the brain.

The new study, however, cannot establish that raising kids caused the observed differences in brain activity. Other factors that influence the number of children, such as virility and societal norms surrounding parenthood, may also play a role.

Still, the results help flip the narrative about parenthood's effect on the brain. “There's a social rhetoric about parenthood being bad for the brain — this idea of ‘baby brain' or ‘mommy brain,'” Orchard says. But “the cognitive challenges related to early parenthood, sustained across the life span, might actually be resulting in a brain that is more resilient.”

Researchers collecting fossils deep inside Kentucky's Mammoth Cave have uncovered the remains of a never-before-seen species — an absolutely tiny ancient shark with nail-like teeth.

The newfound species is called Clavusodens mcginnisi, or McGinnis' nail tooth. The animal lived 340 million years ago and belonged to a group of sharks known as obruchevodid petalodonts, or ""chipmunk sharks"" because of their tiny size and unusual teeth.

These sharks grew to just 3 to 4 inches (7.5 to 10 centimeters) long and fed on crustaceans, worms and other prey on the seafloor, according to a statement released by the National Park Service (NPS). It's thought their tiny size helped them avoid large predators while foraging.

Researchers unveiled McGinnis' nail tooth in a study published Jan. 24 in the Journal of Paleontology. The species name is named after David McGinnis, a retired National Park Service superintendent, and their teeth, which resemble old iron nails.

A team of researchers plucked the fossils out of rocks inside Mammoth Cave, the longest cave system in the world. Mammoth Cave is a treasure trove for ancient fish fossils, with more than 70 different species identified within its walls, according to a 2024 study published in the journal Parks Stewardship Forum.

Underground rivers and streams forged the cave's passages, which are made up of rocks that have preserved marine sediment from the Carboniferous period (358.9 million to 298.9 million years ago). The cave has given researchers a unique window inside these rocks, and therefore the marine environments they preserve, according to the 2024 study.

Researchers have been documenting vertebrate fossils in Mammoth Cave since 2019. The work is challenging because of the cave's often cramped conditions and limited space to move equipment in and out.

""Many of these sites have low ceilings requiring crawling for long distances on hands and knees, and at times belly crawling,"" the researchers wrote in the new study. ""The fish fossils are frequently encountered in the cave ceilings or walls.""

The newly discovered fossils came out of the Ste. Genevieve rock formation and date back to 330.9 million to 323.2 million years ago. The fossils are the oldest obruchevodid petalodonts discovered so far, according to the study.

Researchers suspect that these ancient sharks may have lived in reef-like systems filled with marine invertebrates called crinoids, or sea lilies, that attached themselves to the sea floor like plants. However, that assessment remains speculative until researchers carry out more studies on the ancient fish and their habitat, according to the study.

Discoveries like McGinnis' nail tooth enable researchers to learn more about long-extinct sharks and the ecosystems they inhabited.

""The fossil discoveries in Mammoth Cave continue to reveal a wealth of new information about ancient shark species,"" Barclay Trimble, the superintendent at Mammoth Cave National Park, said in the statement. ""Researchers and volunteers collected samples from the main Mammoth Cave system and from smaller isolated caves throughout the park that have provided new data on previously known ancient sharks and revealed several species that are brand new to science.""

Using bat poop to fertilize plants like cannabis can sometimes have deadly consequences. A report highlights two fatal cases that affected men in New York.

The patients: A 59-year-old man (patient one) and a 64-year-old man (patient two) in Rochester, New York

The symptoms: Patient one was initially admitted to the hospital for respiratory failure after experiencing various symptoms, including a sore throat, difficulty swallowing and extensive weight loss for about six weeks. At the hospital, doctors ordered a computed tomography (CT) scan of the patient's neck, which revealed that he had mucus clogging his upper voice box and right-side vocal cord.

Patient two, meanwhile, was initially hospitalized for having low salt levels in his blood, which caused tissue swelling. His teeth were also in poor condition, which made it harder for him to eat or drink, leading to weight loss, and he had a chronic cough.

What happened next: When he was admitted to hospital, patient one seemed to be wasting away and had signs of bacterial blood poisoning. An additional CT scan, this time of his chest, showed that he had a buildup of fluid in his lungs. Doctors treated him with antibiotics and briefly put him on ventilation to support his breathing. The medical team later identified traces of fungi in the patient's urine and in coughed-up mucus from his respiratory tract.

In the hospital, patient two had a fever of 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius). A CT scan revealed multiple lesions in his chest and abdomen. In addition, traces of fungi were detected in his urine.

The diagnosis: Both patients — who were not affiliated in any way but were from the same area — were diagnosed with a rare fungal lung infection called histoplasmosis.

Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

This condition occurs when people inhale spores of a harmful fungus named Histoplasma capsulatum, which usually grows in soil and the poop of birds and bats. Approximately 1 to 2 people per 100,000 in the United States are infected with histoplasmosis each year. However, most people exposed to the fungus don't develop any symptoms. Symptoms are more likely to emerge in people with lung conditions or weakened immune systems, compared to the general population.

In these two cases, the patients' symptoms may have been exacerbated by other diseases that they had before they developed histoplasmosis. For example, patient one had emphysema, a common type of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in which air sacs in the lungs are damaged, which constrains breathing.



The pair also smoked tobacco and cannabis.

The treatment: Following their diagnoses, the patients were prescribed antifungal drugs to combat their infections. However, despite this treatment, both died. Between 5% and 7% of patients who are hospitalized with histoplasmosis die of their infection.

What makes the case unique: Both patients in these cases were already using or planning to use bat poop as fertilizer to grow cannabis for personal use. Patient one had ordered bat poop — or guano — online, while patient two intended to use guano he'd found in his attic following a bat infestation.

In a report describing the cases, doctors noted that various online sources claim that bat guano is a ""natural superfood"" for cannabis plants because it contains lots of nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Meanwhile, numerous U.S. states have recently legalized the recreational use of cannabis — including Arizona in 2020, New York in 2022 and Ohio in 2023 — which may be encouraging more people to grow their own cannabis, the report authors noted.

The dangers of using bat guano as fertilizer aren't unique to cannabis — the product would be risky for any gardening, the authors emphasized. But given guano is being marketed for cannabis specifically, there is a need to raise public awareness around the potential risks associated with using the poop in this way, they warned.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22science%20news%22%20site%3Alivescience.com","Quantum-inspired storage can store 100s of terabytes of data on a tiny crystal — with plans to make them into much larger discs","https://www.livescience.com/technology/electronics/quantum-inspired-storage-can-store-100s-of-terabytes-of-data-on-a-tiny-crystal-with-plans-to-make-them-into-much-larger-discs","Wed, 12 Mar 2025 13:00:10 GMT","

Scientists have found a way to store hundreds of terabytes of data onto a tiny crystal, with plans to scale this up to a disc-sized device that can be compatible with modern computing.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Scientists have devised a way to store and read data from individual atoms embedded in tiny crystals only a few millimeters in size (where 1 mm is 0.04 inches). If scaled up, it could one day lead to ultra-high density storage systems capable of holding petabytes of data on a single disc — where 1 PB is equivalent to approximately 5,000 4K movies.

Encoding data as 1s and 0s is as old as the entire history of computing, with the only difference being the medium used to store this data — moving from vacuum tubes flashing on and off, tiny electronic transistors, or even compact discs (CDs), with pits in the surface representing 1s and smoothness indicating 0.

The hunt is now on for even denser data storage, which is leading scientists to the subatomic world. In a new study published Feb. 14 in the journal Nanophotonics, researchers have used an electron trapped by a defect in a crystal to represent a 1 with the lack of a trapped electron indicating 0.

The work was inspired by quantum techniques, the scientists said. In particular, they integrated solid-state physics applied to radiation dosimetry with a research group working strongly in quantum storage — but this specific work builds classical computing memory.

The technology works by shining a laser with a specific amount of energy that will excite an electron. At this point, a reading device may register the presence of light. No light means no trapped electron.

This only works when the crystals include defects, such as an oxygen vacancy or a foreign impurity. ""These defects present very nice characteristics,” first author of the study, Leonardo França, postdoctoral researcher in physics at the University of Chicago, told Live Science. ""One of them is the ability to store charge.""

Knowing this, the team used rare earth ions as dopants — impurities added to a material to alter its properties — with the key lying in devising a way to excite an electron from a specific rare earth ion so it then becomes trapped. If imagining how a CD works, this would be equivalent to creating a pit.

""We have to provide sufficient energy to release an electron from a rare earth ion and the defect — a nearby defect — will sense that,"" said França. ""So you capture the electron by an intrinsic electric field. This is the writing part.""

Then you come to reading the data. ""Basically, you have to use another light source so that the electron will be released from the defect,"" said França. ""And that leads to a recombination of charges, and that leads to emission of light.""

If the process worked exactly like this, the data would be erased every time it was read, but using lower amounts of light would only ""partially erase information,"" said França. So it would fade over time, in a similar way that data held in tapes fades over 10 to 30 years.

While the team used the rare earth element praseodymium and an yttrium oxide crystal, the work could equally extend to other non-rare earth element crystals with other non-dopants. But rare earth elements have the advantage of providing known and specific wavelengths that enable us to excite electrons using standard lasers.

The researchers' initial aim was to address individual atoms. They haven't yet achieved this goal, but França believes that the technique the team has pioneered puts them on the right track.

Appetite for further research is attributed to how scalable this technology is, potentially ushering in low-cost, high-density storage formats in the future for various applications, França said.

The good news is that the optical, laser side of the equation is already well understood and cheap. Likewise, the crystal would cost little money to produce at scale. That leaves the cost of acquiring the rare earth elements and devising a way to introduce defects using mass manufacturing methods.

—'Quantum CD' could hold up to 1,000 times more data than today's optical disks

—New 'petabit-scale' optical disc can store as much information as 15,000 DVDs

If these obstacles can be overcome, the crystal could be fabricated as a disc, he added, and be read by inexpensive readers. The final question would be around how densely you can store data on a hypothetical disc.

""In our crystal, where we have around 40mm3 [0.002 cubic inches], we could store a few hundred terabytes,” França told Live Science. After performing some calculations, he put the figure at approximately 260 TB.

That figure is based on the crystal the scientists investigated, but França sees a future in which you could easily increase the defect density. This naturally leads to the possibility of PBs of data stored on a single device the size of a disc.

Wide receiver Cooper Kupp had been on the trading block, but the Los Angeles Rams' plan has changed. The team has informed the former All-Pro receiver, 2021 NFL Offensive Player of the Year and Super Bowl MVP they are releasing him Wednesday, which marks the first day of the new league year, according to NFL Media. 

Los Angeles is releasing Kupp after not being able to find a team willing to give up compensation in addition to taking on on the $20 million Kupp was due on his contract. The motivation for the Rams to dump Kupp and save $7.52 million in cap space likely increased after they signed three-time first-team All-Pro wideout Davante Adams to a two-year, $44 million contract with $26 million guaranteed on Sunday.

Kupp, who will turn 32 years old on June 15, initially broke the news via social media that he was on the block on Feb. 4. In his post, Kupp shared that while he doesn't agree with the Rams' decision to move on from him, he looks back on his time with the franchise with ""so much pride."" Kupp also made it clear that he is highly motivated to resume his career elsewhere. 

I was informed that the team will be seeking a trade immediately and will be working with me and my family to find the right place to continue competing for championships. 

I don't agree with the decision and always believed it was going to begin and end in LA.   Still, if there's one thing that I have learned over the years: there are so many things that are out of your control, but it is how you respond to these things that you will look back on and remember. 

I have taken so much pride in playing alongside my teammates for the LA community, so thank you for embracing my family and making this such a special place for us. 

2024 began with one of the best training camps of my career. Preparations start now for 2025. Highly motivated, as healthy as ever, and looking forward to playing elite football for years to come. 

Love you guys ..  But coming for it all. 

A 2017 third-round pick, Kupp became an immediate contributor inside Rams head coach Sean McVay's offense. He helped the Rams reach the Super Bowl in 2018, McVay's second year on the job. 

In 2021, Kupp had one of the greatest seasons of all-time regardless of position. He won the NFL's ""triple crown"" after leading the league in receptions (145, second-most in a season in NFL history), receiving yards (1,947, second-most in a season in NFL history) and receiving touchdowns (16) in the regular season. He is only one of five to win the receiving triple crown in a season since the AFL/NFL merger in 1970, which is why he was named the 2021 season's NFL Offensive Player of the Year. 

In that postseason, Kupp again led all receivers in catches, receiving yards and touchdown catches. He was named Super Bowl LVI MVP after catching the game-winning score in the Rams' 23-20 win over the Bengals. 

Injuries have slowed Kupp down in recent years, however, as he's missed a combined 18 games since the Rams won the Super Bowl. Kupp's injuries are surely part of why the Rams are moving on from him. He has averaged 67 catches, 753 yards receiving and six receiving touchdowns in an average of 11 games played since his historic 2021 campaign. Kupp average 59.2 receiving yards per game in 2024, his fewest since his rookie year in 2017 (57.9).

Despite his recent injury issues, expect several teams to be interested in bidding for Kupp's services, especially those that could use a sure-handed veteran wideout with playoff experience. He is due $5 million in guaranteed salary from the Rams in 2025, so his contract with his new team may not break the bank.

Here's a look at five teams who might be interested in Kupp's services. 

Dallas needs some reinforcements around CeeDee Lamb, especially with Brandin Cooks hitting the open market. Kupp's addition would free things up for Lamb while also giving Dak Prescott another established weapon to throw to. There's also a personal connection since new Cowboys wide receivers coach Junior Adams coached Kupp in college at Eastern Washington.

The Seattle Seahawks desperately need help at the wide receiver position after cutting Tyler Lockett and trading DK Metcalf to the Pittsburgh Steelers within the past week. Kupp wouldn't be the sole focus of opposing defenses either in Seattle with Jaxon Smith-Njigba catching 100 passes in 2024, which tied the Seahawks franchise single-season record (also set by Lockett in 2020). 

Seattle also lured the top free agent quarterback available in Pro Bowler Sam Darnold, who agreed to a three-year, $100.5 million contract. Offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak is a disciple of the Shanahan-McVay tree, so the offense he runs will be similar to one Kupp ran with the Rams and the attack Darnold ran with the Vikings. 

Yes, the Ravens did sign DeAndre Hopkins to a one-year deal, but they could still use another middle of the field/slot weapon with some juice outside of Zay Flowers. Kupp would make a lot of sense for a Baltimore squad that's right in the thick of Super Bowl contention.  Baltimore isn't afraid to go after big names in free agency. Just a year ago, the Ravens signed Derrick Henry to a two-year deal, and we all see how that's worked out for them. Kupp would join a loaded Ravens offense that also includes two-time league MVP Lamar Jackson, fellow wideouts Flowers and Rashod Bateman and tight ends Isaiah Likely and Mark Andrews. 

Bo Nix thrived last year despite not having the most proven of receiving crops outside of Courtland Sutton. In Denver, Kupp would play with an up-and-coming quarterback and inside Sean Payton's pass-happy offense. Kupp's ability to make plays over the middle would certainly aid Nix, who routinely makes plays outside the pocket. 

The Chargers could use another receiver to fill out their line alongside 2023 first-round pick Quentin Johnston and 2024 second-round pick Ladd McConkey after the Buffalo Bills lured away Josh Palmer in free agency on Monday. They also have the second-most cap space in the NFL ($93.8, per Spotrac), so they could outbid anyone for Kupp. Plus, they're a team that made the postseason last year with a fun, young quarterback in Justin Herbert, and Kupp wouldn't even have to move.

Not to suggest it was ever in real doubt — because it wasn't. But it should still be noted that Gonzaga officially punched its ticket to a 26th straight NCAA Tournament late Tuesday with a 58-51 win over Saint Mary's in the championship game of the 2025 West Coast Conference Tournament.

Twenty-six straight is crazy.

Here's a history lesson: In November 1998, I was a senior in college at the University of Memphis, which was hosting a tiny school from Washington named Gonzaga. Even as a lifelong college basketball fan, I don't remember recognizing the Zags, perhaps because they played in a small conference on the West Coast and, at the time, had literally never won a game in the NCAA Tournament.

The Zags beat Memphis 88-73 that day. Roughly four months later, they beat Minnesota to win their first NCAA Tournament game in history, then beat Stanford to advance to their first Sweet 16 in history, then beat Florida to advance to their first Elite Eight in history.

Wild story.

Even wilder is the fact that the program has literally never missed the NCAA Tournament since. Again, the streak is 26 straight (and would be 27 if not for the 2020 NCAA Tournament being canceled). It's difficult to make a proper comparison. But imagine if something like, I don't know, Louisiana Tech in Conference USA, built its program to a place of respectability, then randomly made the Elite Eight — and then went on to make the next 25 straight NCAA Tournaments and appear in two national title games.

It sounds ridiculous, I know.

But that's more or less what Gonzaga has done. As I often say, don't take it for granted or get bored with it because it won't last forever — and it's possible we'll never see anything like it again.

Saint Mary's falling to Gonzaga resulted in the Gaels dropping to No. 21 in Wednesday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings, where Auburn remains No. 1 based on the strength of its body of work. For what it's worth, Jerry Palm currently has Saint Mary's projected as a No. 8 seed in the NCAA Tournament in his latest Bracketology.

Not many people would have predicted the Pittsburgh Steelers' current predicament a month or even a week ago, but here we are. The Steelers, after an unsuccessful attempt to re-sign Justin Fields, are now waiting to see if Aaron Rodgers will play for them in 2025. 

Pittsburgh waited throughout the NFL's second day of the legal tampering period to get an answer from Rodgers, who is reportedly deciding between the Steelers, the Giants or even retiring. 

""Aaron Rodgers is holding the entire Steelers organization hostage,"" former NFL general manager Doug Whaley said Wednesday on 93.7 The Fan, via Steelers Depot. 

There are conflicting reports regarding when the Steelers may get an answer from Rodgers. While many are expecting a resolution this week, NFL Media reported Wednesday morning that it could be weeks before a decision is made. 

Pittsburgh's current conundrum started when they weren't able to get Fields to re-sign before the start of the league's tampering period. Money was reportedly one of the reasons why the Steelers weren't able to get a deal done; CBS Sports' Aditi Kinkhabwala reported that the Steelers didn't guarantee any money after the first year. Fields ultimately came to terms on a two-year, $40 million deal with New York that included $30 million guaranteed. 

Once Fields was out of the picture, the Steelers turned their focus to Rodgers and Sam Darnold, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Darnold agreed to a three-year, $100.5 million deal with the Seahawks, leaving Rodgers as their primary option. 

On Tuesday, after a two-day period that saw Pittsburgh trade for wideout DK Metcalf and come to terms with free agents Malik Harrison and Darius Slay, Steelers general manager Omar Khan spent the day focusing on his quarterback position. And as they waited to hear from Rodgers, the Steelers reportedly reached out to former Pittsburgh quarterback Mason Rudolph about a possible reunion. Pittsburgh also hasn't ruled out the possibility of re-signing Russell Wilson. 

The Steelers may decide to wait for Rodgers to make a decision, but if they do, they're going to need a contingency plan in the event that Rodgers decides to go in a different direction. Pittsburgh doesn't currently have a single quarterback on it's roster; that needs to change quickly regardless of Rodgers' situation, hence the reported call from Pittsburgh to Rudolph. 

One thing we know for sure is that the Steelers are all-in on Rodgers after missing out on Fields. Whether or not Rodgers will decide to go Pittsburgh, and when that decision will be made, though, is still anyone's guess.

NFL teams benefit greatly when their players drafted outside for the first couple of rounds or so perform right way. Impact production for cheap, relatively speaking, allows contending squads to compete for Super Bowls for an extended amount of time.

Young players who demonstratively outperform their rookie deals also receive some assistance from the league prior to negotiating their second contracts. The NFL's Performance-Based Pay program is a collectively bargained benefit that compensates players in accordance to how much they play relative to their draft slot, which determines a player's rookie deal value. 

San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy, the final pick of the 2022 NFL Draft, is one of the bigger beneficiaries since he is an NFL starting quarterback making relative peanuts in comparison to his peers. He took in $985,000 in 2024, but with the league's program, he will receive another sum of $857,842 -- nearly the same figure as his 2024 salary. The great news for teams is these bonuses do not affect their players' cap hits. 

Another notable winner from this program was 2024 first-team All-Pro Detroit Lions safety Kerby Joseph, who led the NFL with nine interceptions this past season. The 2022 third-round pick took home $1,163,628 million from his rookie deal in 2024, and he will receive another $996,253 from the program. 

New York Jets linebacker Jamien Sherwood was the biggest winner from the program in 2025: the 2021 fifth-rounder, who took home $1,055 million in salary in 2024, received a bigger sum from the program ($1,092,206 million). This week might be the best of Sherwood's life between the bonus check from the program hitting just after he re-signed with the Jets on a three-year, $45 million contract with $30 million guaranteed for his second NFL deal. 

Here is a list of the top 25 performance-based pay distributions from the 2024 season:

The bubble has been pared down to eleven teams, and it is conference tournament time. One loss and the season is over. Some teams need to do more than others to get into a good position for an at-large bid, but better to win the tournament and erase all doubt.

One nice thing about these conference tournaments in particular is that all games will be at neutral sites. That means any game against a team in the top 50 is a Quad 1 game. Also, the committee likes to see that teams can win off of their home floors. After all, the NCAA Tournament is not played on home courts.

The conference tournament draw is important for bubble teams. You want games that can help you, but they need to be winnable games. You'd have to have to beat Auburn or Duke, for example, just to get any help at all.  

Six bubble teams are in action today. They are all opening round games in their conference tournaments. Only a couple are truly helpful.

Check out Palm's latest bracket, full field of 68 and Bubble Watch at the Bracketology hub

All times ET

vs. South Carolina, 1 p.m. | SEC Network, fubo (Try for free) 

Arkansas is not far above the last four teams in the bracket as we enter the day. The Razorbacks have won four out of five to end the regular season, but that one loss was to the last-place Gamecocks. Another one of those losses and Selection Sunday will be a nervous one for the Razorbacks.

vs. Notre Dame, 2:30 p.m. | ESPN, fubo (Try for free)

Speaking of needing a good draw, North Carolina did not get one. The Tar Heels need quality wins, and the first chance at one would be in the ACC Tournament semifinal against Duke. It would have been far better to be on the other half of the bracket to play Clemson or Louisville. Of course, UNC lost to both of those teams already. 

vs. Colorado, 3 p.m. | ESPN+ 

The Mountaineers are the highest-ranked team still on the bubble and should be OK if they can avoid a bad loss ... but this game provides an opportunity for a bad loss. A win gives them a date with top seed Houston.

vs Iowa, 6 p.m. | Peacock

At 17-14 overall and 11-14 vs. the top three quadrants, Ohio State needs multiple wins in the Big Ten Tournament to have a realistic shot at the Big Dance. The Buckeyes' draw has them facing Illinois if they beat Iowa, then Maryland after that.  It is hard to be optimistic for Ohio State if it doesn't get a shot at the Terrapins.

vs. Kansas State, 7 p.m. | ESPN+  

The Bears are 17-13 entering Big 12 Tournament action and need at least one win to give themselves a chance. The next game would be against Texas Tech, and a victory over the Red Raiders would do it for sure.

vs. Georgia, 9:30 p.m. | SEC Network, fubo (Try for free)   

Georgia has just recently played itself off the bubble, but the Sooners may still have a little work to do. The wins over Missouri and Texas to end the regular season were a big boost, and a win over the Bulldogs should be enough to hear their name called on Sunday. The Sooners would face Kentucky in the next round and should be able to survive a loss to the Wildcats.

Locks based on résumé: 32 | At-large bids in play: 5 | Automatic bids secured: 11 of 31              	          

Note – all references to NCAA Tournament selection records and trends based on NET rankings excludes the 2021 tournament. Due to shortened schedules and a relatively small number of nonconference games, those rankings are not reliable enough to be considered.

The new NFL league year doesn't kick off until Wednesday at 4 p.m. ET, but the chaos of the offseason is in full swing.

We've had stars receive franchise tags (Tee Higgins and Trey Smith), Pro Bowlers get traded (Geno Smith, Deebo Samuel and DK Metcalf), franchise quarterbacks receive pay raises (Matthew Stafford and Josh Allen), All-Pro edge rushers land record-breaking extensions (Maxx Crosby and Myles Garrett) and a whole lot more. And that was before the NFL's legal tampering period began at noon ET on Monday! 

Since teams have been able to negotiate with other clubs' impending three agents, several high-profile deals have already been agreed to. The biggest ones on Monday were the Seahawks signing Sam Darnold to a three-year contract worth $100.5 million and the Jets signing Justin Fields to a two-year deal worth $40 million. Elsewhere on Day 1, the Patriots added several key defenders for new head coach Mike Vrabel, the Texans traded their star left tackle to the Commanders and the Browns acquired a former first-round quarterback from the Eagles.

Day 2 has brought even more movement, headlined by quarterback Daniel Jones signing with the Colts on a one-year deal worth $14 million. Meanwhile, the Vikings spent big for guard Will Fries and defensive tackle Jonathan Allen while the Texans traded away yet another former first-round offensive lineman, this time sending Kenyon Green to the Eagles for safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson. Then on Tuesday night, the Bills bolstered their pass rush with Joey Bosa and the Ravens added a contested-catch standout in DeAndre Hopkins.

From blockbuster moves to bargain-bin shopping, we've got you covered below with a running tracker of every team's 2024 additions, including external signings and trade acquisitions. For more info on all the free agency deals and rumors, click here.

The Chicago Bears are spending this offseason, and a member of a division rival has taken notice. 

Detroit Lions All-Pro wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown is clearly impressed with the offseason the Bears and former Detroit offensive coordinator Ben Johnson are having. During the NFL's legal tampering period, the Bears agreed to terms with several top-tier free agents that include defensive tackle Grady Garrett, defensive end Dayo Odeyingbo, center Drew Dalman and guard Joe Thuney. 

""I feel like the Bears have unlimited f---ing money,"" St. Brown recently said on his podcast, via NFL Media. ""This shit is crazy. They're just signing new shit for like $40M-$50M. Joe Thuney, boom. Jonah Jackson, bang. Drew Dalman, bang. Dayo Odeyingbo, another crazy amount of money. Grady Jarrett, bang. They're just breaking everybody off. They have unlimited money. What the f--- is this? ... Ben is just making moves left and right.""

The Bears are taking full advatage of the fact that their starting quarterback, Caleb Williams, is playing under a rookie contract, which gives Chicago more spending money than most teams. The Bears have specifically focused on upgrading their offensive and defensive lines after both units struggled in 2024. 

It's clear that Johnson has no interest in a long rebuild. If anything, it appears that Johnson and the rest of Chicago's brass feel that the Bears can be competitive in 2025, and it's easy to see why. 

The Bears have a promising young quarterback in Williams, a talented receiving corps, and a defense that finished second in the NFL last year in red zone efficiency.

The Bears have already had a busy offseason, but don't expect them to slow down anytime soon with free agency officially starting on Wednesday and the NFL Draft just over a month away.

Najee Harris is leaving the Pittsburgh Steelers, agreeing to a one-year deal with the Los Angeles Chargers this week. Now the Steelers have found his potential replacement, on Tuesday striking a one-year pact with former Philadelphia Eagles running back Kenneth Gainwell, according to multiple reports.

Gainwell, 25, spent the last four seasons as the Eagles' top backup at the position, where he spelled reigning Offensive Player of the Year Saquon Barkley during Philadelphia's 2024 Super Bowl run. He was originally a fifth-round draft pick of the Eagles out of Memphis.

With Harris gone in Pittsburgh, the Steelers all but guaranteed fellow running back Jaylen Warren's return with a restricted free agent tender, putting Warren in line to take over as the top ball carrier. Gainwell's reported entrance could result in more of an even split in carries, as the ex-Eagles veteran also has extensive experience as a pass-catching option out of the backfield.

He logged at least 20 catches in each of his first three seasons in Philadelphia, also earning the Eagles staff's trust as a third-down pass blocker. While his rushing totals were minimal working behind Barkley, D'Andre Swift and Miles Sanders from 2021-2024, Gainwell served as the Eagles' most productive running back during their Super Bowl LVII bid in 2022, averaging 5.5 yards per carry that postseason.

The 2025 PGA Tour continues to ramp up as the 2025 Players Championship is set for Thursday at TPC Sawgrass with the first tee times coming at 7:40 a.m. ET. Known for its iconic 17th hole ""Island Green,"" this course will host a vast majority of the top players on tour this week, including 48 of the top 50 players in the OWGR. The latest 2025 Players Championship odds list Scottie Scheffler, the defending champion, as the +360 favorite. 

Rory McIlroy (+800), Collin Morikawa (+1600) and Xander Schauffele (+1600) are some of the other top Players Championship contenders teeing it up. In addition to picking the outright winner, there also PGA odds for top-five, top-10, head-to-head and more to consider this week. Before making any 2025 Players Championship picks, check out the PGA picks from SportsLine's proven golf model.

Built by DFS and betting pro Mike McClure, this model is up nearly $9,000 on its best bets since June of 2020 and has called 13 majors winners heading into the weekend. 

Now that the 2025 Players Championship field is locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times. Here are the three best bets, according to the model:

Fleetwood has been efficient this season, finishing T22 or better in all three events he's played, all against strong fields. His best finish was a T5 at the Genesis Invitational. Slow starts have held him back as he's shot 71 or higher in the first round in all three events. Otherwise, he has just one round over 70 in Rounds 2-4 all season. He has elite strokes gained metrics this season, including ranking fourth in in both tee-to-green and approach-the-green, and the model has identified him as a top-five contender this week, making him a value at 30-1 at FanDuel Sportsbook:

The 15-time PGA Tour winner has been in a win drought since 2022, but he's getting close to a return to the top of a leaderboard. Though he took a slight step back with a T36 last week at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, he's also finished T9 or better three times already this season. If you're not ready to back him as an outright winner (+2000) yet, the top-five market still brings a big return for Thomas this week at +500, which you can get at Caesars Sportsbook.

The top-20 market has some more wiggle room and is a good fit if you're looking to go more conservative than winner or top-five. Here, the model is very comfortable with Matsuyama, who returns +110 and finishes ninth on the projected leaderboard. Matsuyama won the The Sentry to open the season and also recorded top-20s at the Sony Open and the Genesis Invitational. He ranks sixth on tour in strokes gained, making him a strong choice for the plus-money return. 

You've seen the latest best bets from the model. Now, see the full Players Championship leaderboard, including forecasted finishes for Scheffler, McIlroy and more. Visit SportsLine to see the projected leaderboard, all from the model that's nailed 13 golf majors, including the last three Masters and three majors in 2024.

Cleveland quietly pursuing NBA history as they extend winning streak to 15","https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/can-the-cavaliers-win-70-games-cleveland-quietly-pursuing-nba-history-as-they-extend-winning-streak-to-15/","Wed, 12 Mar 2025 03:01:00 GMT","

Tuesday represented an all-too familiar set of circumstances for the Cleveland Cavaliers. They entered their battle with the Brooklyn Nets missing several key contributors: Donovan Mitchell, De'Andre Hunter and Ty Jerome. They struggled through the first three quarters, falling behind by as many as 18 points. And then, in the fourth quarter, they exploded to swipe the game, 109-104, right out from under Brooklyn's noses.

It was a fitting way for the Cavaliers to match their season-opening mark of 15 consecutive victories. They may not have Boston's championship pedigree or Oklahoma City's historic wire-to-wire statistical dominance, but when it matters most, no matter who is on the floor, they find a way to win. Entering Tuesday's action, Cleveland led the NBA with an astonishing +38.6 clutch net rating. They are essentially playing out the end of a sports movie every night. Unsurprisingly, that has taken them within striking range of one of the NBA's most sacred numbers.

Only two teams have ever won 70 games in a season. The 1995-96 Chicago Bulls won 72 en route to a championship. The 2015-16 Golden State Warriors hold the regular-season record with 73, but lost the NBA Finals to these same Cavaliers. The widespread presumption has been that no team would ever win 70 games again. Too much needs to go right for it to happen.

The Bulls, obviously, were led by arguably the greatest player of all time in Michael Jordan. They kept Scottie Pippen despite two turbulent, mostly Jordan-less seasons beforehand, and managed to acquire Dennis Rodman in the offseason for pennies on the dollar. But they also played in an NBA that was somewhat watered down due to expansion. The Raptors and Grizzlies began play in 1995, and the Hornets, Heat, Timberwolves and Magic had all joined within the seven previous years. The talent pool hadn't quite caught up to that expansion yet, so teams around the league were stretched thin. That left room for a super team like the Bulls to run roughshod over the competition.

The Warriors had a different set of advantages. They were by far the NBA's best shooting team at a point in history in which the value of 3-pointers was only just beginning to be understood. They took twice as many 3s as the last-place Milwaukee Bucks, for instance. That doesn't happen anymore. Leading the NBA in both shooting volume and percentage made a team basically unstoppable. Doing so when your best players never miss games helps as well. Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green combined to miss just six all season. Meanwhile, the San Antonio Spurs also won 67 games. 

Why does this matter? Because it ensured that the Warriors needed to keep winning all season. The Spurs were a genuine threat to steal the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference for most of the season, so Golden State couldn't load manage much down the stretch.

The stars just don't really align like that anymore. Perfect health. Limited load management. Ideal opponent circumstances. The maximization of market inefficiencies. This is typically what it takes to win 70. There's a reason it's only happened twice.

And yet, here we sit. On March 11, the Cleveland Cavaliers are 55-10. They have won 15 games in a row, and need to win 15 of their remaining 17 games to reach 70 for the season. The stars might not have aligned quite as well for Cleveland as they did for Chicago or Golden State, but they are within realistic striking distance of 70 if they choose to pursue it.

That choice is relevant here, and fortunately for anyone rooting for history, the Cavaliers, like the Warriors before them, have a reason to keep winning. While they've more or less locked up the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference, they only lead the Oklahoma City Thunder for the best record in the NBA by two games. They split their head-to-head matchups, and Cleveland should hold the conference record advantage, but that's still a pretty meager lead. As long as Cleveland wants to maintain home-court advantage in a possible Finals matchup against the Thunder, winning remains a priority.

The schedule is reasonably favorable to the Cavs down the stretch as well. They'll have a chance to extend their winning streak to 16 against the Grizzlies on Friday, and Jaren Jackson Jr. remains sidelined with an ankle injury. After that, they don't play another team currently seeded in the top five in either conference for the rest of the month. They have multiple games left against competitive teams like the Knicks, Pacers and Clippers, but none against true heavy hitters like the Thunder, Celtics or Nuggets. Assuming health, they will likely be favored in every game they play the rest of the season.

Health is no given. Cleveland was obviously without three core players on Tuesday. Notably, Jerome was listed out with a ""rest"" designation, suggesting that the Cavaliers plan to be cautious down the stretch. But no core member of the rotation is dealing with an injury that is expected to keep them sidelined for a significant stretch. Mitchell is dealing with left groin soreness. Hunter had an illness. Everyone figures to at least be in the mix moving forward even if they are missing games occasionally.

With LeBron James leading the way, Cleveland toppled the last team to win 70 in a regular season back in the 2016 Finals. Therefore, the organization is likely aware of the toll that pursuit put on the Warriors and might prefer to avoid taxing its players similarly. If Cleveland gets to the final week or so of the season with 12 or fewer losses, it might come down to how badly their opponents need wins. Two of their final three games come against the Pacers, who are currently in a three-way tie for the No. 4 seed in the East. If that remains the case, the Pacers will obviously plan to go all-out in those matchups. The other game in that stretch comes against a Knicks team that currently has a five-game cushion for the No. 3 seed in either direction. If Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau were ever to rest his best players, that would be the time.

The odds of going 15-2 across any stretch on an NBA schedule are slim, but the odds of starting a season 55-10 are far slimmer. The hardest part is done. Cleveland has twice won 15 games in a row. It's unlikely, but finishing 15-2 is attainable and doing so comes with the carrot of joining one of the most exclusive clubs in NBA history. 

You still shouldn't bet on the Cavaliers to reach 70 wins, but for the first time, it at least looks somewhat plausible.

You get a real feel for different teams' strengths and weaknesses throughout the long, grueling regular season, but the draw is everything once March Madness arrives. 

Let's dive into this week's edition of 10 Trends and some make-or-break X-Factors for tournament teams. Here's the teams you do (or don't) want to see.

Alabama wants to take 3s and limit 3s. That checks out from a math perspective. But the interior defense has not been a real strength for the Tide. Numerous SEC big men have had a field day against their frontline.

Selection Sunday lookahead: Careful what you wish for, but it's not unrealistic for Alabama to potentially see a No. 7 seed Marquette in the second round. That would be just fine for the Crimson Tide. Marquette has very little beef on the interior. Conversely, a team like Memphis -- which has ramped up the low-post touches for Dain Dainja -- could be a chore.

Boogie Fland's season-ending thumb injury changed John Calipari's rotation drastically. The Razorbacks now play just seven guys. All of them are 6-foot-4 or taller. 

In the last month or so, Arkansas has turned its season around with improved perimeter defense. There are small lead guards littered all across the SEC. Very few are having much success against this Arkansas team that is big at the point of attack with DJ Wagner and Johnell Davis, physical on the wing with Billy Richmond and Adou Thiero potentially looming and has multiple shot-blockers on the back end, -- namely Trevon Brazile, Jonas Aidoo and Zvonimir Ivisic. These Hawgs are a tough matchup for small guards and there's proof in the pudding. 

If Arkansas makes the NCAA Tournament, its defense on lead guards will be a big reason why.

Selection Sunday lookahead: Hypothetically, if a 10-seeded Arkansas got paired with a 2-seed Michigan State that leans heavily on smaller guards like Tre Holloman, Jeremy Fears Jr., Jaden Akins and Jase Richardson, Arkansas has the personnel -- and a proof of concept -- to match up quite well.

Purdue might be really happy if its initial Selection Sunday draw doesn't feature a matchup against a big-time wing. That archetype has given the Boilermakers fits multiple times throughout conference play because Purdue doesn't have the perfect answer. The Boilermakers' go-to lineup is basically three small guards next to Trey Kaufman-Renn and Caleb Furst. That forces some awkward mismatches with a 6-foot-6 wing.

Purdue has the flexibility to pivot to Cam Heide or Myles Colvin, who are more than serviceable defensively (Colvin, especially, has shown moments of terrific defense). However, both guys aren't making 3s at a high clip, so Matt Painter's hands are a bit tied.

Selection Sunday lookahead: Purdue is on that No. 4-seed line. Pairing in the same quadrant with a team like Arizona -- who has talented, physical wings like KJ Lewis or Carter Bryant -- would not be ideal.

The Aggies have built a top-10 defense, but shooters have blazed the nets against them lately. Buzz Williams' club can overwhelm opponents with its physicality and size. Scoring at the rim against the Aggies is a chore, and they swarm to the ball and force turnovers at a 20% clip. That ranks just a hair outside the top-40 nationally.

But Texas A&M cedes plenty of catch-and-shoot 3s. Only two high-major defenses allow more unguarded catch-and-shoot 3s, which is the highest-value 3-pointer to take. If you can get out, run and move the ball with a purpose against the swarming defense, there are open 3-pointers to be found. Lately, Texas A&M has had major issues containing the top shooter on the scouting report. 

Selection Sunday lookahead: Texas A&M is in an awkward spot. It could easily be in that 2-to-4-seed range. Regardless, any quadrant with Louisville would be a problem. Reyne Smith is one of the top shooters in America. He could have a field day if the Aggies weren't careful. 

We've talked about it all year long, but elite shooters get way too comfortable against this Baylor defense. Scott Drew and his staff know its a problem, but it keeps popping up game after game.

It's the same story, different day.

Selection Sunday lookahead: Baylor is on thin ice for an at-large bid, but still has hopes of advancing thanks to its high-end talent. Avoiding a date with a 6-seed like Missouri would be ideal. Caleb Grill is the head of the snake, but Mizzou can heat it up from downtown in a hurry against a disconnected defense.

West Virginia is one of the best defenses in the country at limiting spot-up 3s. Sencire Harris is a terrific on-ball defender, and Darian DeVries' gameplan to play two-on-two and stay home on shooters forces teams to beat West Virginia either in the post or with off-the-dribble, contested jumpers.

There's a real sample size of West Virginia just suffocating the top sniper on the scouting report and limiting their attempts.

Selection Sunday lookahead: West Virginia could very well see Creighton in the first round. I don't love that matchup for the Mountaineers. Ryan Kalkbrenner could give West Virginia's undersized frontcourt some serious problems, and Steven Ashworth is one of the top off-the-dribble snipers in the country. He hits the shots that West Virginia tries to coax.

I'm not entirely sure what to make of it because Maryland's defense has some real bite, but the No. 1 guy on the scouting report keeps getting their numbers against the Terps in the last month or so.

Selection Sunday lookahead: If that trend continues into March, that can be a bit scary if that alpha is feeling good about themselves in a nip-and-tuck game down the stretch. For example, Marquette is a completely different team when Kam Jones is on. Maryland knows that all too well from the non-conference tilt when Jones erupted for 28 points. A heliocentric team would be one I'd want to avoid if I was Maryland. Ole Miss or BYU would not be easy matchups, but they're more of an ""everybody eats"" crew.

Interior defense and rebounding was a major concern in the preseason, and it has come to fruition with Marquette. Elite offensive rebounds have been a problem for Shaka Smart's club.

Selection Sunday lookahead: Georgia would be a 10-seed that I would not want to draw if I was Marquette. The Dawgs have terrific size at all five positions and they're incredibly deep. They hit the glass with reckless abandon over and over again. A team like Utah State or maybe even West Virginia might be a touch more manageable.

Clemson, like West Virginia, is one of the best teams at taking away those ultra-valuable, catch-and-shoot 3s. Especially open ones. The Tigers have not allowed double-digit, unguarded catch-and-shoot 3s in a single game since Dec. 7 against Kentucky.

Selection Sunday lookahead: When its not punting the ball out of bounds, Michigan's double-big lineup creates plenty of unguarded catch-and-shoot 3s. Clemson and Michigan could easily be the No. 4 and No. 5 seeds in a region, respectively. If that's the Round of 32 game, the Tigers match up extremely well. They have the bigs to combat Danny Wolf and Vlad Goldin. It has the defensive scheme to take away those 3s. The Tigers would make life hard for a Michigan team already floundering down the stretch.

Mark Few revamped the rotation in late January to get Emmanuel Innocenti -- the Zags' best perimeter defender -- on the floor way more. But Nolan Hickman has also ramped it up on that end. Gonzaga's defense is up to No. 35 nationally, which is the neighborhood it needs to be in.

If Gonzaga's defense gets a second look, it rarely goes well for you.

Selection Sunday lookahead: Gonzaga's nonconference schedule was packed with potential tournament teams like Baylor, San Diego State, UConn, Kentucky, UCLA, Indiana and West Virginia. Gonzaga would probably relish a rematch for all of 'em.

PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. -- Chances to three-peat don't come around often in sports, let alone professional golf. In fact, the opportunity has never presented itself at The Players Championship before this year. World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler enters as two-time reigning champion seeks a third straight win at TPC Sawgrass.

Scheffler became the first golfer to successfully defend his Players title last year when he miraculously caught Wyndham Clark and Xander Schauffele in the final round. Now, he seeks to add another chapter to his historic three-year stretch.

One of just seven players to win more than once at the PGA Tour's flagship event, Scheffler has set his sights on the record. If achieved, he would sit alongside the most decorated major champion of all time, Jack Nicklaus.

""I would say, last year, this whole tournament was one of the best performances I've had in my career, for sure,"" Scheffler recalled. ""I think the way I played injured Friday and Saturday to just keep myself in the tournament took a lot of fight, a lot of heart. Definitely did not play golf the way I normally would, but I was so comfortable with my swing at the time that I was able to chip it around and play weird shots and somehow make pars and make some key birdies when I needed to. 

""I think about late on Saturday birdieing the last three holes to give myself just an outside chance and getting off to a good start the front nine the next day to put myself up near the lead. I fought really hard all week to have a chance and was fortunate at the end of the week to get it done.""

Scheffler arrived at the PGA Tour's flagship tournament this week in a decidedly different spot compared to the last two years: winless. He's gone through the first two and a half months of the season without a victory -- largely due to a Christmas Day dinner accident that delayed the start of his season. Not only has Scheffler been shut out of the winner's circle, even his tee-to-green greatness has been caught by his peers.

In 2023 and 2024, Scheffler entered The Players roughly one stroke better per round from tee to green than the second-best respective players, Rory McIlroy and Xander Schauffele. It is not as if the falloff is that noticeable -- Scheffler still comes in ranked No. 2 on the year behind Collin Morikawa -- but that separator isn't separating himself from the field … at least not yet.

""Last year is last year,"" Scheffler said. ""I'm not trying to replicate it. I'm not trying to look back on it. At the end of the day, it's in the past. It was a great year. I'm tremendously thankful. I lived a full lifetime in a year. A lot of great things happened, and I'm very thankful for that. 

""But when it comes to this year, I've never been a guy that sets long-term goals. Like in terms of a season, I have what I would think of as dreams and aspirations, but my goal is to be as prepared as possible when I step up on the first tee and then I want to have a good attitude when I go out and play over each shot. And that's how I view success.""

As each week passes, Scheffler shows more signs of breaking out. He led the field in strokes gained off the tee at the Arnold Palmer Invitational following a relatively middling performance with the big stick across the PGA Tour's West Coast Swing. His iron play remains solid, and his short game has shined the last two tournaments. While the greens at Bay Hill may have frustrated the world No. 1, the putter had been in perfect sync before a poor showing at Arnie's Place.

Some numbers are trending; others are working against him. Not only has no one gone back-to-back-to-back at TPC Sawgrass, but no one has done it at any tournament on the PGA Tour since Steve Stricker completed a three-peat at the 2011 John Deere Classic. There have only been six three-peats since 2000, and four of those belong to one man. You guessed it: Tiger Woods.

Opportunities like this are rare, conversions even more so. Then again, Scheffler has proven to be the exception to most rules during this run. He was able to win while injured at this event last season. He has been able to come back from astronomical deficits like at the Olympics. And maybe, he'll be the first to pull off a three-peat at The Players much like he was the first to pull off the two-peat.

""It doesn't suit one type of player,"" Scheffler said of TPC Sawgrass. ""I think some of the results you see here over time for guys where it's not a horses-for-courses-type place, it's just the guys that are playing the best are going to be on the leaderboard on Sunday. That's plain and simple.""

We are still in the middle of conference tournament season, but the major conference tournaments have wrapped up and given us plenty to talk about. While some of the results didn't necessarily affect NCAA Tournament seedings, some of them did have major implications ahead of Selection Sunday.

The Notre Dame Fighting Irish are one of the teams that have fallen into a bit of a slump, and their struggles cost them some hardware. Others like the TCU Horned Frogs are enjoying a revitilization.

Conference realignment certainly played a role in this year's chaos. Cori Close's UCLA Bruins are thriving, while the Stanford Cardinal, also a former Pac-12 team, might soon be seeing the end of a historic streak.

Without further ado, here are some winners and losers from the major conference tournaments:

The Bruins have only lost two games this season and both were to rival USC. Getting revenge made their win in the Big Ten championship a little bit sweeter.

That was UCLA's first conference tournament title since winning the Pac-10 in 2006. That victory also helped the Bruins return to No. 1 in the AP Top 25 rankings, marking their 13th week at the top spot this season. Before this year, UCLA had never been ranked No. 1 before. This is also the first season the program has registered 30+ wins.

It's already a historic year for the Bruins, and it's only getting better as winning the Big Ten Tournament means UCLA can feel more confident about getting a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament.

Falling to Duke 61-54 in the ACC Tournament semifinals pretty much cost Notre Dame the potential to earn a No. 1 seed.

The Fighting Irish were a Sweet 16 team in 2024 and also one of the hottest teams this season thanks to the nation's best backcourt in Hannah Hidalgo and Olivia Miles. They have also quietly been one of the top rebounding teams with players like Liatu King.

That being said, Niele Ivey's team has had some lackluster performances lately on both sides of the court, and consequently they will enter the 2025 NCAA Tournament having lost three of their last five games. 

Stanford fell to Clemson 63-46 in the first round of the ACC Tournament, and without a strong resume this season, the Cardinal will likely miss out on the 2025 NCAA Tournament. The program has not missed the Big Dance since 1988, and through that time Stanford has won three national championships and made 15 Final Four appearances. The Cardinal's 36-year streak is second only to Tennessee (42) for the longest all-time.

The Cardinal have been a West Coast powerhouse for a while, but a lot of change has taken place there lately. Stanford went from the Pac-12 to the ACC after conference realignment, plus legendary coach Tara VanDerveer retired. Despite now-head coach Kate Paye being on the staff since 2005, the program had to go into rebuilding mode after losing Cameron Brink, Hannah Jump and Kiki Iriafen from last year's squad.

TCU has not made the NCAA Tournament since 2010, but winning the Big 12 title gave TCU an extra boost to be considered a No. 2 seed.

TCU finished last in the Big 12 two years ago with a 1-17 record, and now the Horned Frogs have won both the regular season and the conference tournament. Big 12 Player of the Year Hailey Van Lith played a key role in this success. She has shined all season and earned the tournament's Most Outstanding Player honor with 20 points in the tile game against Baylor. 

Van Lith started her career at Louisville and spent last season under Kim Mulkey at LSU. She competed in three conference title games before, but this year she finally earned a victory. 

LSU was originally going in the ""loser"" category, but in the grand scheme of things, the Tigers are doing just fine. While a conference title is always nice, LSU didn't need to win the SEC Tournament because the Tigers did well enough in the regular season to earn the right to host in the NCAA Tournament. 

The Tigers got bounced by Texas in the SEC semifinals, which means Kim Mulkey has still not won an SEC title since taking over the program in 2021 -- but she did win a national championship in 2023. 

That being said, the Tigers were competing without leading scorer Flau'Jae Johnson, who is resting while dealing with shin inflammation. That was Mulkey's decision because she wants Johnson to be fully healthy for the NCAA Tournament. 

Also, Aneesah Morrow was carried off the floor during the third quarter against Texas, and that injury scare had LSU fans holding their breath. However, Mulkey later gave a positive update, saying Morrow will be good to go for the NCAA Tournament.

World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler will try to become the first golfer to win the Players Championship three years in a row when he plays in the event at TPC Sawgrass this week. Scheffler backed up his five-stroke victory in 2023 with a one-stroke win last year. He is the +360 favorite (risk $100 to win $360) in the 2025 Players Championship odds, followed by Rory McIlroy (+800). Other 2025 Players Championship contenders include Collin Morikawa (+1600), Xander Schauffele (+1600) and Ludvig Aberg (+2000). Aberg finished eighth at the Players Championship in 2024 and is +200 (risk $100 to win $200) to crack the top 10 this week. 

Morikawa finished second behind Russell Henley in the Arnold Palmer Invitational last week, leaving Morikawa without a PGA Tour victory since October 2023. Morikawa's best finish at the Players Championship was a T-13 showing in 2023 and is +140 (risk $100 to win $140) to finish inside the top 10 this week. Schauffele, meanwhile, holds the PGA Tour's current longest streak of consecutive made cuts at 58 and is -360 (risk $360 to win $100) to make the cut at TPC Sawgrass. Before making any 2025 Players Championship picks, you need to see the 2025 Players Championship predictions and best bets from golf insider Patrick McDonald.

McDonald joined CBS Sports as a golf writer in 2022 after stops at NBC Sports and RyderCup.com. Covering the sport from a broader perspective, McDonald still likes to dip his toes into the betting pools on a weekly basis between the PGA Tour, DP World Tour and more. Featured weekly on the Early Wedge, he gave out numerous winners in 2024, including Jake Knapp (50-1) at the Mexico Open and Xander Schauffele (20-1) at the PGA Championship. 

This year, he has already nailed Sepp Straka (66-1) in The American Express, Joe Highsmith (110-1) in the Cognizant Classic and Russell Henley (65-1) in the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Anyone who followed his sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting apps like FanDuel, DraftKings and Fanatics.

Now, McDonald has focused his attention on the 2025 Players Championship field and locked in his best bets and top longshot sleepers. You can only see them here.

McDonald loves the value of Sepp Straka at +6000 (risk $100 to win $6,000) at FanDuel this week. The European Ryder Cup member is off to a hot start this season, winning The American Express to go along with four additional top-15 finishes. He has played excellent golf at the Stadium Course two of the last three years, posting a ninth-place finish in 2022 and a T-16 last year. 

Straka is coming off a top-five finish in the Arnold Palmer Invitational, shooting 3-under in the final round to move a few spots up the leaderboard. The 31-year-old ranks second on the PGA Tour in green in regulation percentage, third in birdie average and fifth in scoring average. He continues to be priced in the 60-1 range, making him a valuable golfer to include in your Players Championship bets.  

""Straka surged over the weekend at the Arnold Palmer Invitational employing a strategy we have seen from him ample times this season – hit fairways and hit greens in regulation. A first-round 77 in brutal conditions proved too much to overcome for the big Austrian, but he remains at a palatable price in a field he has proven he can keep up with,"" McDonald told SportsLine. See who else to back here.

McDonald has locked in his best bets for the 2025 Players Championship and has also selected an epic longshot who's priced over 160-1. This golfer has proven ""he can get the job done no matter the field and no matter the stage."" You can only see the picks at SportsLine.

So which golfers should you target for the 2025 Players Championship, and which longshot could bring a huge payday of more than 160-1?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22sports%20news%22%20site%3Acbssports.com","Lynx's Napheesa Collier says WNBA players are prepared for possibility of lockout amid CBA negotiations","https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/lynxs-napheesa-collier-says-wnba-players-are-prepared-for-possibility-of-lockout-amid-cba-negotiations/","Wed, 12 Mar 2025 00:01:35 GMT","

Minnesota Lynx star Napheesa Collier said during an upcoming appearance on CBS Sports' ""We Need to Talk Now"" that WNBA players are internally discussing the possibility of a work stoppage as they continue their negotiations with the league on a new collective bargaining agreement. 

While Collier said that ""no one wants"" a lockout, the players are ""prepared for any possibility right now.""

In October 2024, the Women's National Basketball Players Association (WNBPA) announced its intention to opt out of the current collective bargaining agreement at the end of the 2025 season. That gives the WNBPA and the WNBA until Oct. 31, 2025 to come to terms on a new CBA. 

""We are ready to lead transformational change -- change that goes beyond women's sports and sets a precedent for something greater,"" WNBPA president and Seattle Storm star Nneka Ogwumike said at the time. ""Opting out isn't just about bigger paychecks -- it's about claiming our rightful share of the business we've built, improving working conditions, and securing a future where the success we create benefits today's players and the generations to come. We're not just asking for a CBA that reflects our value; we're demanding it, because we've earned it.""

The two sides met for preliminary conversations in December, but there has been no substantial news since then. 

Earlier this month, Chicago Sky star Angel Reese had 2024 Most Improved Player DiJonai Carrington, now a member of the Dallas Wings, on her podcast and the two hinted at the possibility of players holding out until their demands are met. 

""I got to get in the meetings, because I'm hearing, if y'all don't give us what we want, we sitting out,"" Reese said. 

""That's a possibility, for real,"" Carrington responded. 

Women's basketball has exploded in recent years, thanks in large part to the influx of young stars such as Reese and 2024 WNBA Rookie of the Year Caitlin Clark. While WNBA players have seen some benefits, such as charter flights, their salaries remain low, due in large part to revenue sharing. 

In 2025, the minimum salary for a veteran with three-plus years of service is $78,831, while a regular max contract is $214,466 and a supermax, the most a player can possibly make, is $249,244. In the NBA, players receive about a 50% cut of all basketball related income, but in the WNBA the players only get 10%, per former All-Star Chiney Ogwumike. 

Collier made it clear in her interview with ""We Need to Talk Now"" that the players are not looking to make NBA-level money, but they do want NBA-level revenue sharing. 

""We're not asking for the same salaries as the men, we're asking for the same revenue shares,"" Collier said. ""That's where the big difference is. We get such a small percentage of revenue share right now that affects our salary. We're asking for a bigger cut of that, like more equitable to what the men's revenue share is. It wouldn't get us anywhere close to their salaries, we're not asking for the same salaries, we're asking for the same cut of the pie of what is made in our league.""

There are still eight months until the end of this current CBA, which includes an entire season that will shape discussions. A lot will happen between now and then, and it's far too early to say if a lockout will actually happen. It's clear, though, that the players aren't messing around. 

""You're seeing the power shift to the players,"" Collier said. ""For us right now, it's such a power that we hold that I think we need to use correctly, again in our CBA negotiations.

The PGA Tour Florida swing continues this week with the 2025 Players Championship set to begin on Thursday, March 13 at 7:40 a.m. ET at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach. The 2025 Players Championship field features 48 of the top 50 players in the Official World Golf Ranking, with No. 1 Scottie Scheffler and No. 2 Rory McIlroy leading the way. Eight past champions are in the field for 'golf's fifth major,' including Scheffler (2023, 2024), Justin Thomas (2021), McIlroy (2019), Si Woo Kim (2017), Jason Day (2016), Rickie Fowler (2015), Matt Kuchar (2012) and Adam Scott (2004). 

Scheffler is listed as the +360 (risk $100 to win $360) betting favorite in the latest 2025 Players championship odds. Other top contenders include McIlroy (8-1), Collin Morikawa (16-1), Xander Schauffele (16-1), Ludvig Aberg (20-1), Justin Thomas (20-1), Hideki Matsuyama (30-1), Patrick Cantlay (35-1) and Tommy Fleetwood (35-1). The total 2025 Players Championship purse is $25 million, with the winner's share coming in at $4.5 million. The winner will also earn 750 FedEx Cup points.

With this week's tournament having a massive purse, it is imperative to nail your 2025 Players Championship one and done picks. Should you use this event to target a favorite like Scheffler, McIlroy, or Aberg? Would it make sense to take a long shot like Jason Day (65-1), Tony Finau (70-1), or Jordan Spieth (80-1)? Before locking in your 2025 Players Championship one and done picks, you need to see what SportsLine DFS pro and PGA expert Mike McClure has to say. 

The One and Done format is growing in popularity. It has several noticeable similarities to NFL Survivor pools, with the main difference being entries are not eliminated with a bad week. Players pick one golfer per week and earn points based on their selected golfer's prize money for that tournament. Golfers can only be used once per season, and the point format makes nailing majors and big money tournaments critical.

McClure is a DFS legend with over $2 million in career winnings, and he's been red-hot on his PGA picks dating back to the PGA Tour restart in June of 2020. McClure uses his proprietary simulation model to analyze the field and crush his golf picks. In fact, the model is up more than $9,500 on its best bets since June 2020, nailing tournament after tournament.

This same model has also nailed a whopping 13 majors entering the weekend, including the 2024 Masters -- its third Masters in a row -- and last year's PGA Championship and U.S. Open. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting apps like FanDuel, DraftKings and Fanatics. 

McClure has been nailing his One and Done picks for the last two years, correctly calling Nick Taylor's epic win at the RBC Canadian Open, as well as Scottie Scheffler's and Jon Rahm's victories as the Masters. 

More recently, at last week's Genesis Invitational, a Signature PGA Tour event, McClure' top One and Done pick, Ludvig Aberg, outlasted the field for an outright win. The 26-year-old took home a massive $3.6 million payday for himself and gave his OAD backers a huge bump in their pool's standings. 

Now, McClure has dialed in on the 2025 Players Championship golf tournament and just locked in his one and done picks and PGA predictions. They are a must-see for any player looking for an edge in their One and Done pool. You can only see McClure's Players Championship one and done picks at SportsLine.

One of McClure's top One and Done picks for the 2025 Players Championship is Collin Morikawa. The 28-year-old has two major championships and a total of six career PGA Tour victories on his professional resume. Morikawa has been red-hot in 2025, posting two second place finishes and another pair of top-20 finishes in four total starts. 

Morikawa has been one of the most talented golfers on the PGA Tour since turning professional, and is widely considered to be one of the best irons players in the world. He currently ranks second on the PGA Tour in both total strokes gained (1.856) and strokes gained tee-to-green (1.341). He also ranks 10th in strokes gained on approach (0.908) and 37th in strokes gained off-the-tee (0.341). With his recent form and his status as one of the most accomplished players in the field, McClure is expecting Morikawa to be in contention until the end this weekend. You can see who else to back at SportsLine.

McClure is also targeting another golfer for his 2025 Players Championship one and done picks who was outstanding throughout the 2024 season and is a 90-1 longshot. This player has championship pedigree and has the ability to win any tournament he enters. You can find out who it is, and check out all of McClure's Players Championship one and done picks at SportsLine.

Who wins the the Players Championship 2025, and which golfers should you target for your PGA one and done picks this week? Visit SportsLine now to get Mike McClure's Players Championship 2025 one and done picks, all from the DFS pro who nailed Ludvig Aberg's outright win at the Genesis Invitational, and find out.

Here are some of the sportsbooks to bet on PGA Tour tournaments, along with the various golf sportsbook promos they currently offer.

NEW BRITAIN, Conn. — Among the countless things that make March the most magical sports month on the calendar, the unexpected spill into the NCAA Tournament by an unsuspecting, lowly seed team from a one-bid league ranks high on the list. 

We typically get at least one of these every year. Programs that flail in obscurity for four months, then roar to life when given a chance at glory in the biggest week on the calendar, make for some incredible stories.

On Feb. 19, Saint Francis was a 10-17 team toiling in the bottom half of the Northeast Conference.

On Tuesday night, it pulled a stunner and did something that will live forever at the tiny school in the tiny town Loretto, Pennsylvania. (Population: 1,168)

SFU went into the gym of No. 1 Central Connecticut State — 22-6 coming in, a nation's-best 14-game winning streak and obviously the best team in the conference this season — and the Red Flash (what a great moniker) pulled off their third straight NEC tournament win by three points to take the league's automatic bid to the 2025 NCAA Tournament. 

The game was ugly, but nobody associated SFU cares about that now.

The team is dancing for just the second time ever, the previous trip coming all the way back in 1991. Saint Francis won 46-43, shooting a paltry 31.7% and making only five of its 26 3-point attempts. The game was on a tightrope all night; Saint Francis never held a lead larger than four, CCSU's biggest advantage being just two points. This after CCSU beat Saint Francis twice this season by a combined 31 points.

Red Flash coach Rob Krimmel had guided his alma mater to the NEC championship game three times previous, in 2020, 2019 and 2017, all losses. Had he lost belief he'd ever coach in the NCAA Tournament?

""You start to say, well, are we going to have one?""

On his play card from Tuesday night's game, Krimmel wrote ""Audience of One,"" ""Thy Will Be Done"" and ""Surrender,"" leaving his faith in whatever outcome it would be. 

Saint Francis took the lead 43-41 with 33.1 to go after Red Flash big man Valentino Pinedo hit a close-range shot while being fouled. CCSU answered back with 17 seconds to go when guard Joe Ostrowsky hit a layup to tie the game. 

In that moment, Krimmel opted against calling a timeout. It was high-stakes drama in a low-major title game.

""The last couple possessions, I think, epitomizes this team,"" Krimmel told CBS Sports. ""They trust the coaches and we trust them. I don't need to call a timeout. Go make the plays you need to make."" 

Eight seconds later, Daemar Kelly sank a midrange jumper that won the game. CCSU's Devin Haid wound up having a halfcourt heave that nearly fell — and would've sent the game into OT — but it was all of three or four inches off, giving the Red Flash verification to rush the floor and celebrate program history. They're the eighth different NEC champion in as many years to win the league, following a succession of Wagner (2024), Merrimack (2023), Bryant (2022), Mount St. Mary's (2021), Robert Morris (2020), FDU (2019) and LIU (2018).  

Enjoy the moment, coach. You deserve it 🥹👏#BELIEVE🔴⚡️🏀 pic.twitter.com/uVIQsrxLsz

As his players leapt into each other's arms at midcourt, Krimmel watched from the sideline as he got a moment and victory he'd waited 29 years for. At 47, he is now what he once thought he'd never become: a Saint Francis lifer. Krimmel grew up in State College, Pennsylvania. His older brother played at Penn State. His parents worked there. He wanted to play there. He wasn't good enough. 

Saint Francis recruited him. He resisted it.

""My first impression of the place: I didn't like it,"" Krimmel told CBS Sports. ""I thought college was Beaver Stadium, 100,000 people, big campus. I grew up going to football games, basketball games, and my first trip up there, I told my dad, 'I'm not going to a school like that.'"" 

Six months later, he committed. He never left. Krimmel arrived in the fall of 1996, played for SFU for four years, then immediately joined the coaching staff after graduating in 2000. He spent the next 12 years under Bobby Jones and Don Friday, two coaches with names straight out of a pulp fiction novel. Krimmel was promoted to head coach in 2012.

""The thing that's kept me there so long is the people are special,"" Krimmel said. ""I believe the college experience is a four-year experience, but it's about developing people. And that's at the heart of what Saint Francis is.""

Enrollment is under 2,500. It's one of the smallest Division I schools in the country, with a humble campus in a small community in the middle of nowheresville Pennsylvania. The school has an NIL budget of precisely $0. Krimmel isn't boasting about that, but he did tell me it made getting into the NCAA Tournament — where some schools with NIL budgets north of $7 million and $8 million await — that much more gratifying.

""There's a purity to that. I wasn't going to sell my soul just to try to win a game or try to win a championship,"" Krimmel said. ""I was going to try to do it the way I thought was the right way. And if it didn't work, I'll give the keys to someone else and they can drive the bus and do it a different way.""

In the last two years, the program lost critical players prior to the portal. Krimmel added six players after going 8-22 a season ago and finishing second-to-last in the lowest-rated conference, with a KenPom ranking of 354. This year's team (ranked 310th) might wind up being the lowest-rated team to ever earn a spot in the bracket. 

So what?

The fact we can even have a story like this is what makes March Madness the most interesting and rewarding event in sports. About 10 minutes after the game went final Tuesday night, friends and family made their way to the court take pictures alongside the media. Players took turns posing with the NEC championship trophy. Members of the staff could be seen FaceTiming, one of them all smiles as he pointed into his phone proclaiming, ""I told you! I told you!""

The Red Flash band, endured the six-hour road trip from Loretto to New Britain, lined up along the baseline and exchanged high-fives with the players. Mothers and sons were posing for pics, everyone in championship shirts and hats. This was something they could only have dreamed about. 

On Tuesday night, it became reality. It was as pure a scene as you'll see in the sport this month. 

“We goin' to March Madness, baby! We goin' to March Madness!”This month. The best. The absolute best. pic.twitter.com/sooOUYan3Y

""This is the team that has embraced the journey the best,"" Krimmel said. ""Even in our darkest moments, maybe some of our most embarrassing losses, they were able to come in the next day and try to move the needle and just be a little bit better.""

What was true of the players was true of the coach, even as it seemed for most of the past four months like this would be another sub-.500 season for a program almost nobody knows anything about.

""This is probably the first year that I wasn't going to let the season, or my self worth, be defined by how many games we won,"" Krimmel said. ""It was: my value is, can we develop young men?"" 

As Krimmel was reflecting on his own journey, he watched from about 30 feet away as his his players were climbing the ladder, taking turns cutting the net. He saw a group of young men in euphoria, coming to realize with each passing moment that yes, they had actually just won that game and were actually going to get to play in the NCAA Tournament. 

Krimmel became emotional. He had every right to be. It took him 25 years to find this moment, and it came in maybe the most unexpected way in the most unexpected season of Rob Krimmel's life.

""I don't know that my circumstances are like anything else across the country, but I can tell you that Saint Francis has allowed me to grow up as a player, as a young professional, as a father, as a husband,"" he said. ""Twenty years from now, they'll remember this, but the relationships that they've built, that's what it's about.""

He was looking at one of his sons, Tom, as he said this. Krimmel's teenage boy is named after his college coach, Tom McConnell, and Tom Fox — a former Red Flash player who hosted Krimmel back in the mid-'90s, when he went there on a visit with no intentions of ever coming back.

Only college basketball and the unique setup of the NCAA Tournament could pave way for a story like this. A tiny school in a tiny town in Pennsylvania is now on the map thanks to a man who was once a kid who didn't know what he was going to do with his life. Turns out, he had the rest of his life waiting for him at a place called Saint Francis University. 

And now, that story gets to be part of the 2025 NCAA Tournament. There will be few better when the field of 68 is unveiled on Sunday.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22sports%20news%22%20site%3Acbssports.com","Armed with more eligibility and NIL, Diego Pavia's value could go from nonexistent to full-fledged empire","https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/armed-with-more-eligibility-and-nil-diego-pavias-value-could-go-from-nonexistent-to-full-fledged-empire/","Wed, 12 Mar 2025 16:36:00 GMT","

Diego Pavia is now a commodity. Check that -- an empire if you count the fact his lawyer lives in Puerto Rico.

""It is an incredible place to live with a huge community of expats, entrepreneurial spirit and nice tax advantages,"" Ryan Downton told CBS Sports.

These type of things matter now. As of December, we thought Pavia's story had ended. Vanderbilt's quarterback completed a colorful, inspiring career by leading the Commodores to a seven-win season, its first above .500 since James Franklin left 12 years ago.  

After five years and three programs, Pavia was off to the NFL. Or, so he hoped. 

""Shoot, I'd like to think I was probably the best quarterback in the country if I was coming out this year,"" he said. 

But there has been more at work in this story than hopes and dreams. In November, Pavia sued the NCAA for an extra year of eligibility. The shock waves from the result of that lawsuit are still being felt. Pavia just might be on the cutting edge of a new eligibility model as CBS Sports detailed last month. 

Downton had originally approached the quarterback the day before the epic upset of Alabama on Oct. 5. The veteran attorney had a right and the ability to seek out this unique client. Downton was a Vandy cheerleader while pursuing his undergrad degree in the business school. It occurred to him that Pavia deserved an extra year of eligibility despite a winding career that began at New Mexico Military Institute and migrated to New Mexico State before a transfer to Vanderbilt. 

The suit states that Pavia's eligibility clock starting in junior college (at NMMI) violated anti-trust laws. It argues, in essence, that the restriction denied the quarterback of an opportunity at more NIL benefits. The judge who ordered the injunction agreed and estimated Pavia could earn $1 million in NIL benefits because of his extra year. A month after the suit was filed, a Tennessee judge issued a preliminary restraining order allowing Pavia that extra year of eligibility, his sixth. 

The quarterback known for his emotion reacted accordingly. 

VANDY WE F*CKIN TURNT 💯 https://t.co/9qAcBUvtSK

""This might be life changing,"" Pavia told CBS Sports. ""I love this city, the people in it.""

That's where the commodity part of the 5-foot-8, 210-pounder from Albuquerque comes in. Pavia has a team beyond the one in the locker room. You're probably not going to believe this, but the sixth-year quarterback of a Power Four program in the SEC does not have much of an NIL presence at all. ""Small partnership with Slim Chickens,"" Megan Curry mentioned. 

Curry is the founder of AthleteZ PR, a public relations firm that advertises itself as ""a powerhouse for GenZ"". Last week, Pavia became one of the agency's newest clients. Neither side can wait. There is going to be a giant offseason rollout of Pavia as a brand.

Curry has already lectured her client about the rare air he is about to enter. Only 1% of football players really get paid. The intent is to elbow his way to the front of the pack much the way Cinderellas do during March Madness. If Pavia plays it right this season, he could set himself up for years whether the NFL comes calling or not. 

Call it Diego Over America. His empire awaits his arrival. 

""Diego is an enigma,"" Curry said. ""Diego is this kid who came and took the Music City by storm. His energy is infectious. His attitude is above and beyond positive. He gets bad press. There's a lot of people out there … parallel pathing him to Johnny Manziel. This kid can't be further from it.""

Aside from apparently peeing on New Mexico's logo in the Lobos' indoor facility in 2023, Pavia hasn't been a controversial figure.

""It's really, really humbling to hear this kid speak versus celebrating with money hand signs in an end zone,"" Curry said. 

Largely ignored out of Volcano Vista High School, he played two years at NMMI and won a JUCO national championship. New Mexico State won 10 games for the first time in 60 years with Pavia. The quarterback then followed his NMSU coach Jerry Kill to Vanderbilt. 

""He's got a confidence. It's not cocky or arrogant, but I can see how it might come across like that for someone who doesn't know him,"" said Joe Forchtner, Pavia's junior college coach. ""But he's so sure of his abilities, and it's so contagious to his teammates."" 

Armed with an extra year, Pavia's impact in the Nashville community is growing after he blew up on the field (3,100 yards from scrimmage, 28 total touchdowns in 2024). Curry is looking forward to a coming segment on the quarterback in a Netflix documentary on the SEC. 

""When I moved here three years ago, you couldn't find a Vanderbilt flag on the shelves,"" Curry said. ""They weren't selling them. Now you drive down the street and all these people are popping up Vanderbilt flags left and right. He's become the top of the conversation.""

Curry recently sat down with her new client in a sort of come-to-(marketing)-Jesus moment. 

Quick, name three things you want to accomplish this final season. 

""'I'm going to win the Heisman,'"" Curry recalled Pavia saying, ""'I'm going to get my team to the College Football Playoff, and I'm going to always take care of my mother.'

""This kid really thinks all of this is going to go down.""

The injunction led to the NCAA issuing a blanket waiver for 2025-26 for former junior college athletes in a similar position as Pavia. The waiver does not apply to all former JUCO players, just those whose eligibility is expiring. Other athletes, including Tennessee baseball player Alberto Osuna in the same state where Pavia won his ruling, have not been as fortunate.  

The NCAA is appealing Pavia's lawsuit while at the same time granting the waiver. But judging by recent history, the result of Pavia's action may become permanent. The NCAA has been forced by courts in several recent situations to significantly adjust its rules. The association only reacted on NIL benefits themselves after the Supreme Court ruled against it in Alston. 

""As long as NCAA has rules that feel arbitrary, they're going to keep getting challenged,"" Downton said.

While awaiting a ruling on his lawsuit in December, Pavia told this to The Tennessean: 

""There's a lot of money to be made in college football, just because of how much revenue is coming in. There's a lot of people here [Vanderbilt] who work overtime, too."" 

The Pavia action isn't exactly a one-off for him, but Downton says he typically pursues ""health care and security fraud stuff ... that take years to resolve."" 

This one already has the potential to shape eligibility standards going forward. 

""I've got familiarity with the NCAA. They've got familiarity with me, which makes it easier to get their attention and get people to take you seriously,"" Downton said.

As mentioned, this particular pursuit is personal. As a cheerleader and a fan, there were some down times for Vandy in the 1990s. 

""It was a challenge,"" Downton recalled. ""At the same time, [it was] best training table in the country, according to Sports Illustrated. There was great camaraderie. Cheerleaders were part of the athletic department then."" 

With college football getting ready to subdivide if you read the indicators, Vanderbilt doesn't intend to be left behind. The school is the middle of a giant facilities/stadium upgrade. It makes some kind of cosmic sense, then, that Pavia -- the athlete, brand and commodity -- is now pursuing a master's degree in … Legal Studies.

""I want to go to the league, but the best thing for me is to get another year in the SEC, the best [conference] in college football,"" the quarterback said. ""And do something that's never been done here at Vanderbilt.""

Let's face it: a lot has happened, both on and off the field, since we last saw a meaningful baseball game -- back on Oct. 30, when the Los Angeles Dodgers closed out the New York Yankees to win the World Series. Thankfully, a new Major League Baseball season is now just around the corner, with the Dodgers and Cubs slated to kick off the year with the Tokyo Series, a two-game set in Japan on March 18-19. MLB's traditional Opening Day will follow on March 27.

With precious time to spare, we here at CBS Sports thought it would be prudent to provide a refresher course on the offseason's biggest moves. Below, we've done just that by ranking and analyzing the 10 best players who changed MLB teams over the offseason -- be it through free agency or trades. Do note that we've omitted Dodgers right-hander Roki Sasaki from this exercise since the focus is only on players who were already with an MLB organization. 

Got it? Good, let's get down to business.

Soto, a fixture on everyone's shortlist for the title of ""best hitter,"" changed New York teams over the winter after signing the richest contract in the sport's history (15 years, $765 million). His generational wealth is merited. He's a 26-year-old who is very much on a Hall of Fame trajectory thanks to the interplay between his discerning eye, his elite strength, and his feel for the barrel. Soto isn't as blessed defensively, but the Mets will live with that component of his game provided he keeps stacking up 30-homer, .400-OBP seasons. Spoiler alert: He will.

The Diamondbacks improved their chances of returning to the postseason for the second time in three years by inking Burnes, a former NL Cy Young Award winner, to a six-year pact worth $210 million. He'll round out a rotation that now looks significantly stronger and deeper on paper than Arizona's recent iterations. To wit, Burnes compiled at least 190 innings and a 125 ERA+ in each of the last three campaigns. His odds of running that to four were fortified late last season, when he made some corrections to his cutter that boosted the pitch's effectiveness.

The Cubs traded for Tucker from the Astros ahead of his walk year. Who knows what the long-term future holds here, but in the short run, he could help deliver Chicago's first NL Central title since 2020. Based on statistical output alone, Tucker is one of the dozen or so best players in the sport. He's a well-rounded talent who contributes across the board -- notching quality triple-slash marks; hitting 25 to 30 homers a year; swiping nearly as many bags; and playing Gold Glove-caliber defense in a corner -- albeit without necessarily topping any leaderboards. 

Crochet enjoyed one of the sport's biggest breakout seasons in 2024, posting a 115 ERA+ and a 6.33 strikeout-to-walk across 32 appearances in what served as his first year as a big-league starter. Credit his ascent to both a rare clean bill of health and an improved arsenal (he added a cutter). The Red Sox acquired him from the White Sox in exchange for a prospect package to fortify the front of their rotation. If Crochet can stay healthy, that gambit should pay off. 

The Red Sox started the offseason with one splash (Crochet) and ended it with another, in the form of Bregman's three-year pact worth $120 million. (The deal includes opt-outs and deferrals and all that fun stuff.) Bregman's position is still to be determined, with incumbent third baseman Rafael Devers publicly stating his unwillingness to move to DH to accommodate Boston's new star. Bregman, for his part, seems open to playing at second base, and in our estimation he should possess the athleticism to make that work in due time. Offensively, he seems to have found one of the few optimal fits that exist for his game outside of Houston.

Snell, a two-time Cy Young Award winner, continued his tour of the National League West by joining the defending World Series champions on a five-year contract worth $182 million. Everyone knows his deal by now. Snell racks up a ton of strikeouts and misses oodles of bats and barrels, all the while handing out his fair share of walks and averaging just over five innings per pop. It's not a recipe that everyone will enjoy, but it is one that has resulted in a career 128 ERA+ all the same.

Another talented left-handed starter, Fried (and his eight-year, $218 million contract) was part of the Yankees' pivot after losing out on Juan Soto. He's been one of the best pitchers in baseball for a while now, amassing the highest ERA+ among left-handed starters since 2020 (min. 200 innings). Fried's game is based around limiting the quality of contact he surrenders and generating tons of ground balls. That combination served him well during his eight years in Atlanta, and there's no reason to think he'll find anything but success now that he's moved to New York.

Adames served as the first big free-agent of the Buster Posey Era in San Francisco, with the two parties agreeing to a seven-year deal worth $182 million. He's coming off a season that saw him set career highs in both home runs (32) and stolen bases (21). The Giants can only hope that he continues to feature that kind of dynamic offensive skill set moving forward. Alas, there is some real risk here since Adames reliably punches out more than 25% of the time. Another risk factor worth monitoring: the public-facing defensive measures also disagree on how good his glove is anymore. 

At one point this offseason, the Yankees found themselves with a glut of starters and in need of some late-inning help (closer Clay Holmes and setup man Tommy Kahnle left through free agency). Sensibly, they leveraged the former to address the latter, turning lefty Nestor Cortes (and a prospect) into Williams. When Williams has been healthy (and mind you, he was limited to 21 innings last year), he's been one of the best relievers in the sport. He's averaged more than 14 strikeouts per nine innings during his career, thanks in part to his signature ""Airbender"" changeup. Williams is entering his walk year, meaning that his production and his wellbeing this season could position him to challenge Josh Hader's record (five years, $95 million) for reliever contracts.

As noted above, Cortes was the main return in the deal that sent Williams to the Bronx. (The Brewers also landed infielder Caleb Durbin, who has a chance to help them this season as a pull-happy right-handed batter with wheels.) Cortes, too, is embarking on his final campaign before free agency. He's finished with a 105 ERA+ or better in three of the last four seasons, making him a nifty and valuable addition to the Brewers rotation.

It seems as though every time the Milwaukee Bucks and Indiana Pacers meet, something overly dramatic occurs. Whether it's a feud over the rights to a game ball or an NBA Cup upset, these teams have stumbled into one of the more fun rivalries in basketball. Tuesday was yet another stunner. But this time, it was purely a basketball matter.

With 6.1 seconds to go and the Bucks leading 112-110, Indiana's Andrew Nembhard was fouled with a chance to tie the game. He split his free throws, though, putting Milwaukee in the driver's seat up 112-111. Damian Lillard then calmly sank two free throws with 3.2 seconds remaining to extend the lead to three, meaning Milwaukee's worst-case scenario, barring something catastrophic, was overtime.

And then something catastrophic happened.

TYRESE HALIBURTON OH MY GOODNESS!!!!FADING TRIPLE TO TIE IT AND THE FOUL 🔥🔥Get to TNT for the final seconds of Bucks/Pacers! pic.twitter.com/o3Pr7qFRw9

With 3.2 seconds left, Indiana lined up for an unorthodox inbounds play. All four possible pass recipients lined up in the backcourt, with three in a parallel line. The entire design, which Indiana first used in an Eastern Conference finals game against Boston a year ago, was meant to generate enough confusion to free Tyrese Haliburton on the move. That's exactly what happened. 

Haliburton caught the inbound pass and chucked up a 3-pointer as a desperate Giannis Antetokounmpo scampered into him and committed a foul. Haliburton hit the 3 and sank the free throw to give the Pacers an improbable four-point play and a one-point lead. Antetokounmpo missed a triple on the other end. Game over.

The shot was incredible in a vacuum, but it also carried significant playoff implications. Indiana and Milwaukee are now tied with identical 36-28 records. The Detroit Pistons have played two more games than both and split them, putting them at 37-29 and all three teams effectively tied for the No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference. It is entirely possible that this shot winds up swinging home-court advantage in a first-round series between the Pacers and Bucks, or changing who winds up facing who when the first round arrives.

Regardless of how the standings look in a month, this was one of the craziest shots of the 2024-25 season. Game-winning four-point plays are extremely rare. Defenses know that the single most important thing in defending an end-of-game situation while leading by three is not to foul. But Indiana was able to scheme their way to the line, and Haliburton's incredible shot-making was enough to steal the game.

The NFL has reached Day 3 of the legal negotiating period and is on the doorstep of the new league year. Despite having the ability to agree to terms with a new team, it's largely been crickets from Aaron Rodgers. The former New York Jets signal-caller is reportedly mulling his next stop in the NFL, with the Pittsburgh Steelers and New York Giants as the two most notable destinations. 

As he continues to toss around the idea of which team he'd like to play for in 2025, former two-time Super Bowl champion and current CBS Sports HQ NFL analyst Bryant McFadden is making the case for his former team in the Steelers. And the New York Giants took some shrapnel in the process. 

""Worst case scenario when you talk about playing for Pittsburgh, you're going to win nine ballgames. The New York Giants worst case scenario, you might win two or three.@BMac_SportsTalk says Aaron Rodgers would be making a mistake to choose New York over Pittsburgh pic.twitter.com/hcEGZJnkWW

""Even when both organizations have been, you know, below average, to say the least, Pittsburgh has still been a winner, right?"" McFadden told ""Maggic and Perloff"" on SiriusXM 375. ""And if you look at the roster, Pittsburgh has a better roster. So, worst-case scenario when you talk about playing for Pittsburgh, you're going to win nine ball games. Worst-case scenario. 

""The New York Giants, worst-case scenario, you might win two or three. Do you really want to go out on that type of note, not being a part of a playoff-caliber team, not being a part of a team that's relevant? Because if you go to New York, it's safe to say you won't be relevant as a team because you won't be good and if you're not good you have no playoff aspirations at all."" 

While those words from McFadden may sting Giants fans, it's an accurate take when looking at each team's prior history. For the Steelers, they've reached the playoffs in four of the last five seasons, and the one year they did not (2022) they went 9-8. Over that same stretch, New York is the exact opposite, making the playoffs just once. They're also coming off a 3-14 season in 2024. 

So, if Rodgers is looking at which team gives him the highest ceiling -- or as McFadden illustrates the highest floor -- the Steelers are a clear choice. That said, free agent decisions are complex and sometimes stretch beyond what appears to be obvious, so it will be interesting to see where the four-time NFL MVP ultimately ends up.

We are almost through the barren late-winter wasteland on the college football calendar. As the south thaws from a particularly chilly January, all eyes turn towards spring practice for an enticing first look at teams for the upcoming season. 

It's a big offseason for the SEC, which is looking to reclaim its spot atop the sport after missing out on each of the last two College Football Playoff National Championships. 

The league has still been a mainstay in college football's postseason, as it sent Georgia, Texas and Tennessee to the playoff last season. Five teams won at least 10 games, and 13 of the SEC's 16 programs qualified for a bowl game. Still, given the SEC's claim as one of college football's premier conferences, championships are the standard. There's certainly a solid crop of top-tier teams, and optimism is never higher than in the spring. 

As spring practices begin, here's a look at the biggest questions surrounding each of the league's 16 teams. 

Who emerges at quarterback? Alabama has to replace veteran starter Jalen Milroe, who posted his fair share of wow moments but never quite put it all together with the Crimson Tide. Even with Milroe off to the NFL, Alabama has built one of college football's deepest quarterback rooms. Longtime backup Ty Simpson eschewed the transfer portal for an opportunity to compete for the starting job -- a spot similar to the one he was in prior to the 2023 season when he battled Milroe -- but he won't be handed the opportunity. 

Austin Mack initially signed to play for Kalen DeBoer at Washington and followed him to Tuscaloosa. New Alabama offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb, who collaborated with DeBoer at Washington and had a brief stint in the NFL, also had a hand in recruiting Mack to the Huskies. That gives Mack a distinct advantage, though Simpson has the edge in experience. Five-star freshman Keelon Russell will also get his fair share of looks. The Tide have a wealth of options, and spring will be key to whittling things down. 

Will roster overhaul lead to resurgence? Between high school signings and transfer portal additions, Arkansas welcomes 40 total newcomers this spring. That's a lot of new faces as the Hawgs look to get things back on track under Sam Pittman, who probably doesn't have a ton of leeway after posting a 10-14 regular-season record over the past couple years. The upcoming practice slate will be crucial for integrating these new faces, as several are expected to step into prominent roles. Arkansas does return quarterback Taylen Green and potential breakout running back Braylen Russell to provide some stability. 

Is Jackson Arnold the answer? Auburn is still searching for some stability at quarterback entering its third-year under coach Hugh Freeze, who typically has a knack for developing high-caliber signal callers. In an effort to bolster the position, the Tigers dipped into the transfer portal to add former blue-chip prospect Jackson Arnold from Oklahoma. Though Arnold brings a significant pedigree -- he was the No. 10 recruit nationally in the Class of 2023 -- and bona fide SEC starting experience, he didn't quite live up to the billing with the Sooners. 

He was actually benched midway through the 2024 season before returning later and, notably, leading Oklahoma to a huge upset win against Alabama. He finished his sophomore campaign with a respectable 1,421 yards and 12 touchdowns to just three interceptions. Arnold is also a legitimate rushing threat, adding an extra dimension to Auburn's offense. Maybe Freeze has the key to fully unlock Arnold's potential. The next month will provide some indication as to how he fits. 

Will Napier innovate on offense? Florida promoted Russ Callaway to offensive coordinator in February, though the move seems mostly symbolic. Coach Billy Napier plans to retain play-calling duties, though Florida's offense has endured its fair share of struggles under his guidance. The 2025 season is key for Napier's tenure. He bought some goodwill thanks to a scorching-hot close to 2024 and standout efforts on the recruiting trail, but his leash isn't that long. 

The Gators need to take significant strides offensively to truly break out, but the pieces are there. Rising quarterback DJ Lagway seems primed to emerge as one of the premier playmakers in the country. Sophomore running back Jadan Baugh is ready for a standout role. Though Florida has to replace its top two receivers, there's a lot of young talent in the room. Napier needs to match the improved roster with his coaching. Leaning more on Callaway, who engineered some of the FCS' best passing offenses during his time at Samford from 2016-19, would be a smart step. 

Can Georgia reload its pass rush? History and Georgia's development under coach Kirby Smart certainly indicates that it will be fine, but the Dawgs' losses along the line of scrimmage are, nonetheless, significant. Mykel Williams, Chaz Chambliss and Jalon Walker are all off to the NFL, taking 18 of Georgia's 45 total sacks in 2024 with them. It should go without saying that Georgia doesn't lack in talent on defense, but spring will be key for some young players stepping up to fill the void. Joseph Jonah-Ajonye, Gabe Harris Jr. and Quintavius Johnson are solid options already on the roster, but perhaps a freshman like Isaiah Gibson -- Georgia's highest-rated EDGE signee in the 247Sports era -- can force his way into the rotation. The snaps are there. 

Did Kentucky do enough to revitalize its offense? Kentucky's 2024 season is best left far in the rearview mirror. The Wildcats spiraled to a 4-8 record, including a 1-7 mark in conference play. It was the program's first losing season since 2020, and its worst SEC record since 2013 -- coach Mark Stoops' first year with the program -- not counting a 2021 season in which Kentucky was forced to vacate its wins. A pitiful offensive effort had a lot to do with the sharp downturn. The Wildcats ranked 15th out of 16 SEC teams in total offense (330.4 yards per game) and 16th in scoring (20.6 points per game). 

To make matters worse, Kentucky lost a majority of its key figures to graduation and the transfer portal. Wide receivers Barion Brown and Dane Key transferred. Three starting offensive linemen departed and, to compound matters, former blue-chip transfer quarterback Brock Vandagriff retired. In an attempt to offset the losses and try to spark a turnaround Kentucky added 12 offensive transfers via the portal. Another thing working in the Wildcats' favor is the fact that offensive coordinator Bush Hamdan is back for his second season, giving Stoops the same offensive coordinator in consecutive years for the first time since 2019-20. 

What shape does LSU's secondary take? Despite claiming the the ""DBU"" title, LSU has had endured some disappointing secondary play throughout coach Brian Kelly's tenure. It's limited the Tigers' ceiling, even though they've consistently boasted some of the SEC's top offenses and even produced a Heisman Trophy winner in 2023 alum Jayden Daniels. So it's a good sign for the Tigers that there is a wealth of defensive back talent descending upon Baton Rouge this spring. LSU signed two four-star transfer cornerbacks in Mansoor Delane (Virginia Tech) and Ja'Keem Jackson (Florida) and pulled four-star safety transfer Tamarcus Cooley from NC State. Additionally, LSU worked really hard to keep top high school signee DJ Pickett, the No. 24 prospect nationally and No. 5 cornerback in the 2025 class, on board. It seems like a question of when, not if, Pickett plays a big role as a true freshman. 

How does Ole Miss replace Jaxson Dart? It won't be an easy feat. Dart earned his status as a program legend by guiding Ole Miss to some of its best seasons ever while posting a staggering 11,970 yards passing and 95 total touchdowns in his career. As he rockets up NFL Draft boards, Ole Miss' coaching staff is getting to work identifying his successor. Third-year sophomore Austin Simmons is the natural option after backing Dart up in 2024. He played in nine games and completed 19 passes for 282 yards with two touchdowns. But he'll have to fend off redshirt freshman AJ Maddox and transfer addition Pierce Clarkson (Louisville). Even if Simmons pulls ahead in the spring, Ole Miss will have its work cut out making sure the offense doesn't lose a step without Dart at the helm. 

Is Blake Shapen healthy? Shapen's Mississippi State career got off to a scorching-hot start, as he posted 974 yards and eight touchdowns through three and a half games before a shoulder injury knocked him out for the remainder of the 2024 season. So he came back for a sixth year of college football. In that span, he's only played one full season. His status will be worth monitoring as the offseason unfolds. The Bulldogs did prepare a nice contingency plan by landing former top prospect Luke Kromenhoek through he transfer portal. 

Who steps up on offense? The quarterback-receiver tandem of Brady Cook and Luther Burden III carved up opposing defenses and helped Missouri win 21 games over the past two seasons. Now they're gone -- with even more significant losses beyond that. In fact, the Tigers have to replace Cook, all three starting wide receivers and each of its top two running backs in Nate Noel and Marcus Carroll. Missouri turned to the transfer portal to address Cook's departure by signing former Penn State backup Beau Pribula, a multi-dimensional threat that should win the job. The Tigers also added 1,000-yard rusher Ahmad Hardy, the 2024 Sun Belt Freshman of the Year at ULM. 

It seems like Missouri is largely content with its in-house options at wide receiver, though Kevin Coleman Jr. comes over from Mississippi State. Otherwise, wideouts like Marquis Johnson, Joshua Manning and Daniel Blood can prove they're ready for more. Mizzou also signed four-star wide receiver Donovan Olugbode, a top 75 prospect in the 2025 class. 

Can the Sooners fix their offensive line? Oklahoma allowed an FBS-worst 50 sacks last season, as the Sooners' offense sputtered in their third year under coach Brent Venables. The offensive line has been a fairly consistent issue throughout Venables' tenure, despite the presence of veteran OL coach Bill Bedenbaugh. Oklahoma isn't going to take a step toward SEC contention if it can't upgrade in the trenches. Starting left tackle Logan Howland is back as a good starting point. He played better as the 2024 season went on. The Sooners also earned the pledge of four-star offensive line transfer Derek Simmons (Western Carolina) and signed Michael Fasusi, the top offensive tackle in the 2025 recruiting class. Fasusi has a college-ready frame and could see plenty of snaps early. Oklahoma is hoping those new faces are enough to upgrade the level of play. 

How does the front seven shape up? South Carolina has to, essentially, overhaul its entire front seven after that unit had an impressive performance in 2024. The Gamecocks lost their top three linebackers and five key players in the trenches, including EDGE Kyle Kennard, who won the 2024 Bronko Nagurski Award after tallying 11.5 sacks. It's not all bad, though; South Carolina does at least return Freshman All-American Dylan Stewart, a former five-star prospect that finished his first year of college football with 6.5 sacks and 10.5 tackles for loss. There's plenty of holes to fill around him, though, and there's a good chance the Gamecocks start several transfers at defensive line and linebacker after bolstering both units via the portal. 

Will young wide receiver group up its game? At the top of Tennessee's agenda is replacing running back Dylan Sampson, who quite literally carried the Vols' offense with his 1,491 yards and program-record 22 touchdowns on the ground. While that's important, Tennessee wouldn't have to lean on its run game as much if a handful of reliable receivers emerge. Tennessee hasn't had a true, go-to option emerge in the wake of Jalin Hyatt's departure following a phenomenal 2022 season. Now the Vols have to replace all three of their leading receivers from 2024.To make matters worse, Tennessee also lost three experienced pass catchers to the transfer portal. 

That means the Vols have just one scholarship receiver with more than one year of collegiate experience on their roster entering the offseason. However, Tennessee's WR room makes up for its lack of experience with potential. Chris Brazzell II (the aforementioned player with more than a year in college) will have his chance to shine in a featured role. Mike Matthews, a former top-40 prospect, will step in as a starter after flirting with the transfer portal. The Vols also added former four-star prospect Amari Jefferson via the transfer portal. Meanwhile, Braylon Staley and true freshman Travis Smith Jr. boast a blue-chip pedigree. Spring will be a great time to sort it all out, and it also affords Tennessee the opportunity to evaluate if it needs to add reinforcements during April's portal window. 

Is Arch Manning ready for the spotlight? In all likelihood, yes. He's been in headlines since his freshman year of high school. That kind of comes with the territory of being a Manning. Still, this will be his first spring in charge of Texas' offense, since he'll be stepping in for longtime starter Quinn Ewers. It's certainly not a question of talent with Manning, who has flashed during his (relatively) limited playing time with the Longhorns. But it is a huge leap from backup to the No. 1 guy for a team with championship expectations.

Will skill position overhaul lead to offensive improvement? Texas A&M has lost some prominent skill position stars via the transfer portal in recent years, including former five-star prospect Evan Stewart (now at Oregon) and 2024 leading receiver Noah Thomas, (now at Georgia). To offset the talent drain, second-year coach Mike Elko turned heavily towards the ubiquitous portal during the spring window. The Aggies added four wide receivers and two tight ends with collegiate experience to their roster ahead of the spring practice slate. 

The jewel of the haul is slot option KC Concepcion, who had 839 yards and 10 touchdowns receiving with NC State last season. Micah Hudson, a former five-star prospect in the class of 2024, also made his way to Texas A&M after failing to break through at Texas Tech as a true freshman. It's a lot of change for one position group, but it could be the spark that A&M's offense needs. 

What does Vanderbilt do at safety? Vanderbilt returns a majority of its defense, but the Commodores did suffer a pair of key losses in CJ Taylor and De'Rickey Wright, who formed one of the SEC's best safety tandems last season. Dontae Carter played all over Vanderbilt's secondary as a true freshman and will be first in line to fill the void. The Commodores also have graduate Marlen Sewell, who tallied 20 total tackles and two pass breakups in 2024. Vanderbilt dipped into the portal to add CJ Heard, who started at safety as a freshman at Florida Atlantic last year. There's some young talent for the 'Dores to be excited about despite the significant losses on the backend.

Junior Bridgeman, a longtime NBA forward who would eventually go on to become one of the wealthiest ex-athletes in the world, died at 71 on Tuesday, the Milwaukee Bucks announced. According to WLKY, Bridgeman suffered a medical emergency during a speaking engagement in Louisville on Tuesday. 

Bridgeman starred at the University of Louisville before getting selected No. 8 overall in the 1975 NBA Draft by the Bucks. He would remain in Milwaukee for nearly a decade, serving a key role on perpetually competitive Bucks teams that were led by Sidney Moncrief and Marques Johnson. He went on to play for the Clippers briefly before returning to the Bucks and retiring.

Bridgeman was a valuable NBA player, averaging 13.6 points per game for his 12-year career and helping several Milwaukee teams reach the Eastern Conference finals. He is better known, though, for what came after his playing career. Despite never making an All-Star team, Bridgeman died as one of the wealthiest former athletes in the world.

His post-career success began with investments in Milwaukee-area Wendy's restaurants. Over time, he continued to purchase more and more franchises. He added a number of Chili's locations to his portfolio, and eventually diversified into other areas, including Coca-Cola bottling and even media, as he purchased Jet and Ebony magazines in 2020. In 2024, Bridgeman bought a 10% stake in his former team, the Bucks.

We are shocked and saddened by the tragic passing of Bucks legend and owner Junior Bridgeman. We send our deepest condolences to his family. pic.twitter.com/XakoTcDeF5

In February, Forbes reported that Bridgeman's net worth had surpassed $1.4 billion. While there is no firm way to accurately assess player wealth, this figure would put him in the running for highest net worth among players not named Michael Jordan, LeBron James or Magic Johnson, all of whom used their success on the court to build sprawling financial portfolios. Bridgeman did not achieve the same success as they did on the court, but still managed to compete with them off of it.

The NBA and NBPA (of which he was a former president) took notice, frequently tapping Bridgeman to speak to younger players about financial literacy and entrepreneurship. He dies having spent the final several decades of his life providing the best possible example to scores of NBA players of how to turn their athletic gifts into generational wealth.

""I am devastated to learn of the sudden passing of Junior Bridgeman,"" NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. ""Junior was the ultimate entrepreneur who built on his impactful 12-year NBA playing career by becoming a highly respected and successful business leader. He served as a mentor to generations of NBA players and athletes across sports who were eager to learn from him about what it takes to thrive in the business world. 

""Junior was a dedicated member of the NBA family for 50 years -- most recently as a minority owner of the Milwaukee Bucks, an investor in NBA Africa and as a player who set the standard for representing the league and our game with class and dignity. We express our heartfelt condolences to Junior's wife, Doris, their children, Eden, Justin and Ryan, the Bucks organization, and his many friends and admirers in the basketball community.""

Cleveland Cavaliers star Donovan Mitchell could be seen munching on some popcorn during his team's 109-104 win over the Brooklyn Nets on Tuesday night. That snack was probably what he had leftover from pranking rookie Jaylon Tyson, who got his fill after the game.

Mitchell was sidelined for the game with groin soreness, and he watched his teammates while shoveling down some popcorn on the bench. That wound up being foreshadowing for his postgame antics.

In a video posted to social media by Mitchell, he followed Tyson to his car in the team garage, where the rookie found it full of popcorn when he opened the door.

There's no telling how long it took Tyson to de-popcorn his car before driving home, but based on the video, he might have been in that garage for a while. He might even get flashbacks the next time he smells popcorn at Rocket Arena.

Tyson, a former standout at Texas Tech and California, was the No. 20 overall pick in the 2024 NBA Draft. In his 40 games with the Cavaliers, Tyson has averaged 3.1 points and 2.0 rebounds per game. The rookie is still carving out a role for himself on a talented roster that just won its 15th straight game and clinched the Central Division title.

These are the potential Cooper Kupp destinations to watch.

The NFL's legal tampering period is drawing to a close, and later today the league year officially begins. At 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time the 2025 NFL season arrives, meaning all the deals that were agreed to over the past three days become official.

That also means we might see more players released, such as Los Angeles Rams WR Cooper Kupp.

Kupp's name has been in the news for months, starting with the buildup to the 2024 NFL trade deadline when it looked like the Rams might move the receiver. With Davante Adams signing with Los Angeles in free agency, it looks as if Kupp will hit the open market in short order.

Kupp has dealt with injuries in recent years, as he has missed 18 games since the Rams' run to Super Bowl LVI, where he caught the game-winning touchdown against the Cincinnati Bengals and was named MVP. Los Angeles informed Kupp that they were seeking a trade for him, but in recent days reporting indicates that rather than trade him, the team might simply release him when the league year begins. 

Here are some teams that should pick up the phone.

The Las Vegas Raiders made one of the bigger moves already this offseason, acquiring Geno Smith in a trade with the Seattle Seahawks.

That move is an indication that Pete Carroll is not going to wait through a lengthy rebuild, and wants to win now. Given that, the Raiders need to make some additions around Smith to help that offense flourish in 2025. The Raiders could certainly address WR with the sixth pick in the NFL Draft — or draft the quarterback of the future if someone they love is available — or even look at improving the running game with Ashton Jeanty.

Adding Kupp now would give them not just a solid weapon in the passing game, but allow them even more flexibility with that pick in the first round. 

Heading into free agency many believed the Patriots would make a strong push for Chris Godwin, arguably the best available WR this offseason. While New England reportedly did make that push, Godwin left money on the table to return to Tampa Bay.

New England did add at the receiver position, bringing in Mack Hollins, but upgrades are still needed around Drake Maye. The Patriots still have the most cap space available according to Over the Cap, and bringing in Kupp would give Maye a reliable weapon in the passing game. 

Whether Kupp would head to New England, or look to land with a more established contender at this point in his career, remains to be seen.

The Cowboys have a star in CeeDee Lamb, but adding pieces around him would be a smart move for Jerry Jones.

Kupp could be a perfect fit in the Dallas offense. He can serve as the underneath, horizontal element in the passing game while Lamb and Jalen Tolbert operate as the more vertical threats in the downfield passing game. Give Dak Prescott Kupp and suddenly the Cowboys' passing game has a little more juice than it did heading into the offseason. 

Similar to the New England Patriots, the Denver Broncos have a rookie quarterback who showed he can lead the team last year in Bo Nix.

However, while the Patriots are looking to get back to the playoffs, the Broncos are coming off an appearance in the postseason and are now looking to go beyond a loss on Wild Card Weekend.

Denver certainly has options for Nix in the passing game, and the Broncos added WR Trent Sherfield already in free agency. But Kupp would give Nix a security blanket underneath and over the middle, and is an ideal fit for what Sean Payton wants to dial up in the passing game. While durability may be a concern with Kupp given his recent injury history, with players like Courtland Sutton, Marvin Mims Jr., Troy Franklin, and Devaughn Vele already in place the Broncos can manage Kupp's snaps, keeping him fresh and hopefully healthy for the entire season. 

Kupp might not need to move far.

With Quentin Johnston and Ladd McConkey, the Chargers have a pair of early-round picks to rely on in the passing game. 

But with the loss of Josh Palmer to the Buffalo Bills, the team could look to bring in another option for Justin Herbert. There may be some overlap in skill sets between McConkey and Kupp, but giving Herbert a reliable veteran target, and adding Kupp's experience to this roster and WR room, all seem like wise moves for the Chargers. 

The Seattle Seahawks have a new quarterback.

Now they just need players for Sam Darnold to throw to in the passing game.

WIth Tyler Lockett being released by the team, and DK Metcalf now on his way to the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Seahawks have to big spots to fill in their wide receiver room. Under new offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak Seattle may rely less on three-WR personnel packages, but a duo of Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Kupp in the passing game is a solid pairing. Add in the fact that Seattle passing game coordinator Jake Peetz is a former Rams assistant coach — making this a reunion of sorts — and you have the favorites in the Kupp chase.

A Kwesi masterclass.

If you buy something from an SB Nation link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

A few hours into Monday afternoon it felt like the Minnesota Vikings hadn't woken up yet. Top free agents were flying off the board, agreeing to terms with other teams — and it was as if the organization was sitting on its hands, in a daze about what to do with their $60M in cap space. 

The foolish part was doubting Vikings' GM Kwesi Adofo-Mensah — who has consistently proven himself to be one of the most astute and shrewd executives in the NFL. On Tuesday Kwesi went to work, and it was astonishingly impressive. 

Minnesota had four primary concerns entering free agency:

The Vikings achieved every single one of these goals, the bulk of which were settled on Tuesday. It was a flurry of activity raiding the second tier of free agents and closing multiple deals while the most active teams on Monday were forced to pick and choose after spending the bulk of their funds on top players.

Letting Sam Darnold walk wasn't an easy decision, but it was the right one. Regardless of whether or not J.J. McCarthy has what it takes to be the franchise QB, the Vikings made a commitment not just to draft him, but trade up for him. The path forward is to support that original vision, and not be sidetracked. There were also salient questions about whether or not we've seen the absolute ceiling of Darnold's ability, and it still didn't get the Vikes any closer to winning a championship than with Kirk Cousins — so why blow cap space on that?

For what it's worth, I think the Seahawks are going to regret pivoting from Geno Smith to Darnold, and that signing won't work out — but that's simply an aside.

Minnesota's free agency brilliance kicked in after their first concern was settled. Will Fries and Ryan Kelly were two of the top interior linemen available in this class, with Fries in particular being Pro Football Focus' No. 4 ranked offensive guard last season — which is a tremendous talent upgrade for the line. These two moves are pivotal, because it brings the Vikings into the new NFL when it comes to protections. Around the league teams are realizing that quarterbacks struggle more with interior pressure than edge pressure. In many ways we had three recent Super Bowls that typified this shift: 

The quickest route between two points is a straight line, and with offenses around the league preaching quick release, and three-second snap-to-pass structures, it only makes sense to try and beef up at DT and rush though linemen, rather than around them. Fixing in the interior will be incredibly beneficial for McCarthy in his first year, just as we saw Bryce Young take strides with the Panthers in 2024 after they added two big offense guards in free agency a year ago.

This is also why beefing up at DT was a priority for Minnesota. The team had fantastic edge rushing from Jonathan Greenard and Andrew Van Ginkel, but the Vikings were weak inside. Both Jonathan Allen and Javon Hargrave may be short-term solutions designed to buy time while the team can find players through the draft — but it's one heck of a bridge to collapse the interior.

Finally it was about retaining talent in the secondary and getting an upgrade. Once again, Kwesi and the Vikings did it. Making sure Byron Murphy was back in the fold was of paramount concern, and they managed to re-sign him, while also inking Isaiah Rodgers from the Eagles — who might not have been the biggest household name in secondary free agency, but is a plus-level nickel with the ability to play some outside corner as needed.

The best part? Minnesota isn't done yet. They still have a little cap space to play around with around $10 million to still use, and potentially more if any deals are restructured. This is easily enough to find some rotational players for depth, and that's extremely exciting if you're a Vikings fan.

At this point the team is trending upwards. If McCarthy can be just 75 percent as serviceable as Darnold was in his first season then this team can make some noise with their additions.

Now let's spin around the league for some other winners and losers of the legal tampering period.

We already took a dive into the teams that got better and the ones who struggled in the opening days of free agency, so instead let's focus on some players who won out.

I'm not going to pretend Jones is a world-beater, but there's something about putting him in a Shane Steichen offense in Indianapolis which is just intriguing as hell. This was the best possible landing spot for him, and provides a rare opportunity to compete for a starting job — which wouldn't have been possible elsewhere.

If Jones stayed in Minnesota he would have been competing to be a caretaker, at best. The knowledge that the team was always looking for a replacement would hang a pall over the job. Instead he now lands on a team with an open QB competition, a coach who understands how to use Jones' skillset, and a team desperate for improvement at QB.

This was a great fit.

Winning or losing is inconsequential if you can find a sucker to pay you. The former Steelers offensive tackle was largely reviled by fans in Pittsburgh for his terrible play, and he allowed the most sacks in the league last season. 

Then the Titans gave him a 4 year, $82M deal with $50M guaranteed. What are the Titans thinking? Nobody knows. Kudos to the agent who got this deal done.

We're seeing massive retraction at WR as teams pivot to interior blocking and a greater emphasis on running backs. Outside of the massive deal D.K. Metcalf got in his extension with Pittsburgh, a lot of receivers are still without teams — and those who have signed aren't breaking the bank.

The Chris Godwins and Davante Adams' of the NFL were always getting paid, but as it stands Amani Cooper doesn't have a team, Stefon Diggs hasn't found a home — heck, the best DeAndre Hopkins could manage was a 1 year, $5M deal with the Ravens. While that's largely about truing to win a championship, it's also indicative of a slack market.

How the mighty have fallen. Wilson's precipitous drop in recent years is really being underscored by how lax the market is for him. As it stands Russ feels like the ultimate “if we can't get anyone else” quarterback on the market.

It's probably fair to think of him as a low-level starter or high-level backup at this point, but it's still remarkable to see a name like Russell Wilson's attract so little attention around the league.

Who made the best signings on the first day of free agency?

The first day of free agency is in the books, and as all the deals get finalized we have a lot of money getting thrown around to a lot of players. Some deals that left me scratching my head, but there were quite a few that excited me. 

Which teams got the best deals for the best players on the market?

I'm a huge fan of Poona Ford and his game. After a standout year in Los Angeles where he helped shore up their run game, he doesn't even have to move houses as he goes to the Rams. I'm a big fan of this deal because it shows some prudent self-scouting by the Rams' front office. The Rams had a bunch of nasty players on the inside when it comes to pass rush, but they're all like 280 pounds and got blown off the ball in the run game. Ford is an instant help in the run game, playing nose tackle or as a shade technique and can help force opponents into second and third and long. Plus getting him for the price they did was awesome.

The Giants have completely overhauled their secondary in the last few seasons, but what they needed was a CB1. Adebo is coming off of a freak leg injury, but when he's healthy he has all the traits to be a shutdown corner and is still only 25 years old. A secondary of Adebo, Deonte Banks, Dru Phillips and Tyler Nubin (and this morning they added Jevon Holland) is one I can get behind, and getting Adebo on a three-year, $30M deal is really cost-effective as well.

This just feels like a match made in heaven for both sides. Bynum gets his big deal at 4 years and $60M, but his APY doesn't really break the bank at the position. Bynum is a sweet fit in new DC Lou Anarumo's offense, using instincts and impressive timing to make plays on the ball rather than raw athleticism. He can play on the roof of the defense in two-high shells and coming from Minnesota means he can do a lot of post-snap rotation.

The Colts needed some more playmaking in their secondary, and Bynum's ball skills and production are a seamless fit in this defense.

I actually thought Koonce would get more money somewhere else, but seeing him go back to Vegas on a one-year deal worth $12M is such nice value and a great way of retaining the good players on the Vegas roster. Koonce is coming off a knee injury, but when healthy he provides such a burst of speed and explosion off the edge that it really meshes well with EDGE Maxx Crosby and DT Christian Wilkins. I also think he steps right back into his starting role, allowing Tyree Wilson to rotate in as he still grows and improves.

Getting Koonce back on a value deal like this just helps to elevate the Raiders defense, a group that I'm intrigued by going into 2025.

Look, I'm not saying he's a godsend or anything but I really like this signing for Harris and the Chargers, especially at that value. Harris is a singles and doubles hitter as a RB with power and a bruising style of play that couldn't really mesh well with the zone-heavy run scheme Pittsburgh uses. The Chargers are more gap scheme runs like power and counter, and Harris is a perfect fit for that, maximizing his violence as a runner in an offense that doesn't ask him to read blocks and waste time laterally. 

On top of that, this deal is only a one-year contract and will only cost the Chargers up to $9.5M, meaning they can keep their eyes open for any rookies to help the room out. Simply a win-win for everyone.

What a kick in the ...

It's the greatest scandal to hit the world of ski jumping since the Engblåd-Distiick incident of 1976, which is something I just invented right this second, but you didn't know that because we don't talk about ski jumping very often. 

Norway was caught red-handed for engaging in blatant crotch cheating at an event over the weekend, when officials were caught adding extra material to the crotch of jumping suits in an effort to make Norwegian athletes soar further in the air. They essentially constructed a crotch sail, modifying pre-approved suits.

But as Icarus flew too close to the sun, Norway got too close to the bum. The suits were found by officials and as a result two gold medalists,  Marius Lindvik and Johann André Forfang have now been disqualified from the world championships for their modified suits. 

Both athletes claim they knew nothing of the adjustments, but either way they competed in the suits. That led to the Federation of International Skiing (FIS) issuing the following statement: 

“FIS has provisionally suspended three Norwegian team officials and two athletes who are being investigated for their alleged involvement in illegal equipment manipulation.”

Blame lands squarely at the feet of head coach Magnus Brevig and equipment manager Adrian Livelten, both of whom have been fired and admit they made the crotch adjustments.

“We regret it like dogs, and I'm terribly sorry that this happened. I don't really have anything else to say other than that we got carried away in our bubble.”

There's no word at this time as to whether or not a dog has manipulated a jumping suit for the purposes of cheating. 

Results of recent competitions are now being reviewed to determine whether or not the Norwegian team cheated at past events. If an investigation concludes there have been more incidents it could affect the lead up to the 2026 Winter Olympics, set to take place in Milano-Cortina in February of next year.

Despite a unanimous scientific consensus, health experts are once again defending the safety of childhood vaccines and so-called autism risk.

Health and Human Services (HHS) officials led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., recently confirmed that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will investigate whether vaccines cause autism. 

The public health announcement reignited a longstanding debate over a theory lacking substantial scientific evidence.

“As President Trump said in his Joint Address to Congress, the rate of autism in American children has skyrocketed. CDC will leave no stone unturned in its mission to figure out what exactly is happening,” a department statement said. “The American people expect high quality research and transparency and that is what CDC is delivering.”

Vaccines are widely regarded as safe and effective. However, vaccine skepticism and hesitancy have contributed to low childhood vaccination rates in the United States. 

Vaccinations help prevent the spread of infectious diseases while protecting those who can't receive them. Most health experts agree they do not cause autism.

Experts told Healthline there have been multitudes of reputable studies on the topic over the past 20 years, and none have established a definitive link between autism and childhood vaccines.

“The scientific community has researched this very thoroughly and there's no evidence that childhood vaccine cause autism,” said Danelle Fisher, MD, a pediatrician at Providence Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.

“Scientists from around the world have approached this question in several different ways and none has found a relationship,” added Bryan King, MD, vice chair for child psychiatry and a professor in the school of medicine at the University of California San Francisco. “Scientists have also looked at whether different preservatives in vaccines could have an effect and none exists.”

Experts reaffirmed the importance of children receiving their scheduled vaccinations to prevent infectious and potentially deadly illnesses like measles from spreading. The growing measles outbreak that began in western Texas in January has been linked to low vaccination rates.

“In some ways, we are victims of our success when it comes to vaccines,” King said. “They can be so successful in preventing severe illness and death that we can lose sight of why we need or want to be protected from those potentially devastating diseases. We forget how devastating those diseases are.”

King and other experts noted that vaccinating the majority of children can help protect children who can't receive vaccines because they are undergoing cancer treatment or have compromised immune systems.

“We need to cocoon these kids,” said Gina Posner, MD, a pediatrician at MemorialCare Medical Group in Fountain Valley, CA.

“It is incumbent upon everyone to be good community members,” added Fisher.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a broad term used to describe a group of neurodevelopmental conditions.

The conditions generally affect communication and social interaction. People on the autism spectrum often demonstrate restricted and repetitive interests or patterns of behavior, and language skills are often delayed in children.

The degree to which a person falls on the autism spectrum may vary greatly from person to person. Five subtypes of autism have been identified.

Most people are diagnosed with autism as children, but adults are sometimes diagnosed as well.

Some symptoms of autism may include:

Experts say early intervention when children are young can help ease symptoms and help autistic people improve their quality of life.

“Early intervention is amazing,” Posner told Healthline. Some early intervention therapies for autism may include:

President Donald Trump and HHS Secretary RFK Jr. have quoted figures saying autism rates in the U.S. have skyrocketed from 1 in 10,000 children in 2000 to 1 in 36 children today. The 1 in 10,000 number appears to come from a single study in the 1960s.

The CDC reports that autism rates have more likely increased from 1 in 150 children in 2000 to 1 in 36 today.

The agency also notes that an autism diagnosis is four times more common in boys than it is in girls.

Experts note they believe the increase in autism rates in the past two decades is due to better diagnosis of the condition. King points out that vaccination rates have not increased in the past 10 years while the rate of autism diagnoses has gone up.

“The rate of autism is as much as it's always been. Now, it's just identified better,” Fisher told Healthline.

“A lot of it is we are better at diagnosing,” added Posner.

King added that “the definition of autism now includes a broader spectrum, which may partially explain the increase in prevalence over earlier estimates.”

If vaccines don't cause autism, then what does?

Experts say there are probably a multitude of factors behind the development of autism, but they say the number one reason is most likely genetics, noting that autism tends to be more common in some families than in others.

In 2023, researchers reported they had identified seven genes linked to an increased risk of autism. 

When introducing their research results, they also noted that prior research has estimated that 50% of genetic risk can be predicted by common genetic variation, and another 15% to 20% is due to spontaneous mutations or predictable inheritance patterns.

“None of the hundreds of genes that contribute to the risk for autism is specific, that is, that a so-called autism gene always or only leads to autism,” King told Healthline. 

“But these genes disrupt the usual development or function of pathways in the brain in ways that significantly increase autism risk. The timing of these effects begins before birth, so as scientists look for causes of autism, the focus is on genes or environmental exposures that occur long before children are receiving immunizations,” he added.

Experts said that children of older parents tend to have higher autism risks due to the aging of sperm and eggs. A 2020 study determined that children born to older parents have a 50% higher risk of autism.

Posner added there is also evidence that premature infants have higher autism risks, as do children born to mothers with gestational diabetes.

“You can't specifically point to one cause,” said Fisher. “No two autistic kids are the same.”

Officials at the CDC announced they will study whether childhood vaccines are a potential cause of autism.

Experts say there have been a multitude of scientific studies done on this subject over the past 20 years, and none have concluded that vaccinations are linked to autism risk.

Genetics is likely a top factor for autism risk. Children born to older parents, as well as those born prematurely or to mothers with gestational diabetes, may also have higher risks.

Children should continue to follow their recommended immunization schedules to prevent the spread of disease as well as to protect children who can't receive vaccines.

Rebecca Smith-Bindman, a professor at the University of California-San Francisco medical school, has spent well over a decade researching the disquieting risk that one of modern medicine's most valuable tools, computerized tomography scans, can sometimes cause cancer.

Smith-Bindman and like-minded colleagues have long pushed for federal policies aimed at improving safety for patients undergoing CT scans. Under new Medicare regulations effective this year, hospitals and imaging centers must start collecting and sharing more information about the radiation their scanners emit.

About 93 million CT scans are performed every year in the United States, according to IMV, a medical market research company that tracks imaging. More than half of those scans are for people 60 and older. Yet there is scant regulation of radiation levels as the machines scan organs and structures inside bodies. Dosages are erratic, varying widely from one clinic to another, and are too often unnecessarily high, Smith-Bindman and other critics say.

""It's unfathomable,"" Smith-Bindman said. ""We keep doing more and more CTs, and the doses keep going up.""

One CT scan can expose a patient to 10 or 15 times as much radiation as another, Smith-Bindman said. ""There is very large variation,"" she said, ""and the doses vary by an order of magnitude — tenfold, not 10% different — for patients seen for the same clinical problem."" In outlier institutions, the variation is even higher, according to research she and a team of international collaborators have published.

She and other researchers estimated in 2009 that high doses could be responsible for 2% of cancers. Ongoing research shows it's probably higher, since far more scans are performed today.

The cancer risk from CT scans for any individual patient is very low, although it rises for patients who have numerous scans throughout their lives. Radiologists don't want to scare off patients who can benefit from imaging, which plays a crucial role in identifying life-threatening conditions like cancers and aneurysms and guides doctors through complicated procedures.

But the new data collection rules from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued in the closing months of the Biden administration are aimed at making imaging safer. They also require a more careful assessment of the dosing, quality, and necessity of CT scans.

The requirements, rolled out in January, are being phased in over about three years for hospitals, outpatient settings, and physicians. Under the complicated reporting system, not every radiologist or health care setting is required to comply immediately. Providers could face financial penalties under Medicare if they don't comply, though those will be phased in, too, starting in 2027.

When the Biden administration issued the new guidelines, a CMS spokesperson said in an email that excessive and unnecessary radiation exposure was a health risk that could be addressed through measurement and feedback to hospitals and physicians. The agency at the time declined to make an official available for an interview. The Trump administration did not respond to a request for comment for this article.

The Leapfrog Group, an organization that tracks hospital safety, welcomed the new rules. ""Radiation exposure is a very serious patient safety issue, so we commend CMS for focusing on CT scans,"" said Leah Binder, the group's president and CEO. Leapfrog has set standards for pediatric exposure to imaging radiation, ""and we find significant variation among hospitals,"" Binder added.

CMS contracted with UCSF in 2019 to research solutions aimed at encouraging better measurement and assessment of CTs, leading to the development of the agency's new approach.

The American College of Radiology and three other associations involved in medical imaging, however, objected to the draft CMS rules when they were under review, arguing in written comments in 2023 that they were excessively cumbersome, would burden providers, and could add to the cost of scans. The group was also concerned, at that time, that health providers would have to use a single, proprietary tech tool for gathering the dosing and any related scan data.

The single company in question, Alara Imaging, supplies free software that radiologists and radiology programs need to comply with the new regulations. The promise to keep it free is included in the company's copyright. Smith-Bindman is a co-founder of Alara Imaging, and UCSF also has a stake in the company, which is developing other health tech products unrelated to the CMS imaging rule that it does plan to commercialize.

But the landscape has recently changed. ACR said in a statement from Judy Burleson, ACR vice president for quality management programs, that CMS is allowing in other vendors — and that ACR itself is ""in discussion with Alara"" on the data collection and submission. In addition, a company called Medisolv, which works on health care quality, said at least one client is working with another vendor, Imalogix, on the CT dose data.

Several dozen health quality and safety organizations — including some national leaders in patient safety, like the Institute of Healthcare Improvement — have supported CMS' efforts.

Concerns about CT dosing are long-standing. A landmark study published in JAMA Internal Medicine in 2009 by a research team that included experts from the National Cancer Institute, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and universities estimated that CT scans were responsible for 29,000 excess cancer cases a year in the United States, about 2% of all cases diagnosed annually.

But the number of CT scans kept climbing. By 2016, it was estimated at 74 million, up 20% in a decade, though radiologists say dosages of radiation per scan have declined. Some researchers have noted that U.S. doctors order far more imaging than physicians in other developed countries, arguing some of it is wasteful and dangerous.

More recent studies, some looking at pediatric patients and some drawing on radiation exposure data from survivors of the atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan, have also identified CT scan risk.

Older people may face greater cancer risks because of imaging they had earlier in life. And scientists have emphasized the need to be particularly careful with children, who may be more vulnerable to radiation exposure while young and face the consequences of cumulative exposure as they age.

Max Wintermark, a neuroradiologist at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who has been involved in the field's work on appropriate utilization of imaging, said doctors generally follow dosing protocols for CT scans. In addition, the technology is improving; he expects artificial intelligence to soon help doctors determine optimal imaging use and dosing, delivering ""the minimum amount of radiation dose to get us to the diagnosis that we're trying to reach.""

But he said he welcomes the new CMS regulations.

""I think the measures will help accelerate the transition towards always lower and lower doses,"" he said. ""They are helpful.""

The federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has taken major steps to help people with medical debt in its nearly 14-year history. It issued rules barring medical debt from Americans' credit reports and went after debt collectors who pressured customers to pay bills they didn't owe. But in early February, the Trump administration moved to effectively shutter the agency. 

""An Arm and a Leg"" host Dan Weissmann talks with credit counselor Lara Ceccarelli about how the CFPB has helped clients at the nonprofit where she works, and how she's navigating the sudden change.

Consumer rights advocate Chi Chi Wu, an attorney at the National Consumer Law Center, describes the court battle she and her colleagues are mounting to slow down the agency's dismantling, and where things could go from here.

Transcript: A medical-debt watchdog gets sidelined by the new administration

Dan: Hey there– 

Lara Ceccarelli works for American Financial Solutions. That's a non-profit credit counseling agency. 

Lara spends her days talking with people who have bills they can't pay, debt collectors chasing them, including for medical bills.

On a recent Sunday night, Lara was winding down her day the way she usually does.

Lara: I tend to read the news before bed. I usually find that it gives me less anxiety, uh, when I have a clear picture of, you know, what's happening in the world and I don't feel like I'm in the dark. And yeah, that Sunday was an exception. 

Dan: That Sunday was February 9, and that evening big news had broken about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau– C F P B, for short. 

A federal agency that's basically a watchdog for consumer rights of all kinds. 

So, for years, whenever Lara's talked to a client, and it sounds like a debt collector is violating their rights — which happens a lot– she has referred the client to the CFPB. And it has worked. 

Lara: They've created these streamlined processes where consumers can submit complaints and see enforcement action taken right away. 

Dan: But that Sunday night, February 9, news broke that an official President Donald Trump had put in charge of the CFPB was basically shutting the agency down. Effective immediately.

Agency staff had gotten a memo telling them to — stop working. 

Lara: I felt my stomach sink through the floor. And my poor husband is active duty in the military, so he was preparing for a very long day the next day on his Navy ship, and he took one look at me and knew something was badly wrong, 

Dan: What did your husband say?

Lara: He tried to tell me that it was all going to be okay. I think he was, uh, doing his best to be as supportive as he could. 

Dan: How late were you up that night?

Lara: Oh, I didn't sleep. I think I got maybe one or two hours of sleep. I Lay down and I, uh, looked at my awful popcorn ceiling and tried to sleep and just could not shut my brain off. 

Dan: She was thinking about how important the CFPB has been– how many clients she's referred to them.

I talked with Lara just over a week after that Sunday night. We'll hear how she managed that first week, how she started shifting what she tells clients– what other resources she's still referring them to. 

And we'll hear about a court case that has slowed down the Trump administration's efforts to completely dismantle the CFPB. And where things COULD go from here.

But first, we should talk about why the CFPB has been such a big deal, especially for people with medical debts. 

This is An Arm and a Leg, a show about why health care costs so freaking much, and what we can maybe do about it. I'm Dan Weissmann. I'm a reporter, and I like a challenge. So the job we've chosen on this show is to take one of the most enraging, terrifying, depressing parts of American life–and bring you a show that's entertaining, empowering and useful.

We're gonna hear about what the CFPB has done about medical debts from somebody who's been working on this issue since the beginning. 

Chi Chi Wu: My name is Chi Chi Wu. I'm a senior attorney at the National Consumer Law Center.

Dan: Actually, she's been at this since before the beginning. Chi Chi Wu joined the National Consumer Law Center in 2001. 

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau started out a half dozen years later, in 2007– as an idea. A proposal from a law professor named Elizabeth Warren. She thought financial institutions needed a watchdog– or as she called it, “a cop on the beat.”

In 2008, financial institutions crashed the economy. Barack Obama became president. In 2010 Congress passed a law to put some new restrictions on financial institutions– the “Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act”– which mandated the CFPB's creation. 

Chi Chi Wu says it didn't take long for medical debts to land in the agency's cross-hairs..

Chi Chi Wu: In 2014, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau did a study that found, if you look at the debt collection items on credit reports… 

Dan: In other words,if you ask: When people get put in collections, what are the bills actually for?

Chi Chi Wu: …over half of them are for medical debt. Half. It was a huge number.

Dan: In other words, a ton of people had lousy credit scores, not because they'd taken a cruise they couldn't pay for. But because they'd gotten sick. 

Chi Chi Wu: It was a huge problem. People would try to be buying a house or a car trying to get a credit card and they'd have to pay more or even get turned down .

Dan: And now it was on the record, thanks to the CFPB. 

The next year a bunch of state attorneys general reached a “voluntary agreement” with the big three credit bureaus — Equifax, Experian, TransUnion. The big three agreed that, they'd wait 180 days — six months — before putting a medical debt on somebody's credit report. 

Chi Chi Wu: So the idea was the consumer would have six months to straighten out the debt with insurance, figure out what they actually owed, maybe dispute it if they didn't think they owed it. 

Dan: Meanwhile, the CFPB was working on another problem.

Chi Chi Wu: Sometimes people would have items on their credit reports, especially for small dollar amounts that they never knew about until they went to buy a car or refinance their house. 

Dan: This was called “parking,” and Chi Chi Wu says it was especially common with medical debts.

Chi Chi Wu: A debt collector would get a medical debt referred from a healthcare provider and they wouldn't do anything with it.

They wouldn't send a single letter. They wouldn't make a single phone call. All they would do is report that debt to the credit bureaus and wait… would just wait until the consumer had to use their credit score for something, you know, refinance their mortgage, buy a car…

Dan: Rent an apartment. Apply for a job… 

Chi Chi Wu: Yes, yes, all of those. And then, their credit would get pulled, this medical debt would show up. And they'd be left scrambling because they would have to clear that debt from their credit report before they could get that mortgage or car loan or job or apartment, and even if they were like, 'I paid that, or insurance should have paid that,' they didn't have time to deal with it. Because if you're in the middle of this big important transaction, you don't have time to wait 30 days for a credit reporting dispute to be resolved. And often it takes longer.

Dan: So, people paid up. They didn't have a choice. 

Chi Chi Wu: And the reason debt collectors do that is because it's cheap. It's cheap to do credit reporting. It's expensive to send a letter because it costs you, what is the price of a stamp right now?

Dan: 73 cents! Plus whatever it costs you to print it out and stuff. A guy who used to be a debt collector once told me sending a bill costs two bucks. 

Chi Chi Wu says the CFPB started working on a rule banning ""parking"" during the second Obama administration. And finalized the rule in 2020, under Donald Trump. It takes a while.

When Joe Biden became President, he appointed a CFPB director who put extra focus on medical debts. The credit bureaus got the idea that they might be subject to some new rules on that topic, and volunteered to make some changes of their own. 

In May 2022 they announced: Instead of waiting just six months to put medical bills on credit reports, they were gonna wait a full year. 

Chi Chi Wu: Because six months sometimes is not enough to deal with an insurance dispute, right? I mean, sometimes it takes a lot longer. So they extended that to a year and then they agreed not to report medical debts under 500.

Dan: And that's when I first talked with Lara Cecarelli for this show. 

I was trying to figure out: Was it really a big deal? The debts would still be on the books — collectors could still bug people about them. And tons of debts would stay on credit reports. 

Lara told me: YEP. That's gonna be a big deal. 

When we talked this month, she told me she could see the impact of the CFPB in her work day to day.

Lara: We've seen a huge decrease in the number of complaints from consumers, or difficulty that consumers are having with medical debt. It's still something that we see. But you know, I used to have at least one conversation about medical debt a day, usually more, and that's not the case. You know, I'm having a couple of conversations per week, maybe, about medical debt. So we've seen the impact.

Dan: And she could see more on the horizon: 

In January, before the inauguration, the CFPB actually issued new rules about medical debt. Like we said, credit bureaus had already promised to remove everything below five hundred dollars. 

Now, under the new rules, all medical debts would come off. And lenders couldn't look at medical debts when they made lending decisions. 

The CFPB had planned to start enforcing those rules in March.

Now– on that Sunday evening in February– Lara was seeing news: The whole agency was shutting down. Over the next few days, news outlets reported more than a hundred and fifty immediate layoffs — and the cancellation of more than $100 million in contracts. And rumors of much deeper cuts to come. 

Lara started doing this job during the first Tump administration. She says, this sweeping change is not just a swing of the pendulum back to how things were then. 

Lara: No, this is new territory. They were still robust, they were still responsive to client complaints. The enforcement and the protection was still there,

Dan: For right now, it's gone. Coming up: What the first CFPB-free week was like for Lara and her colleagues. What she's telling clients now. And what Chi Chi Wu and her colleagues are doing. 

An Arm and a Leg is a co-production of Public Road Productions and KFF Health News — that's a nonprofit newsroom covering health issues in America. KFF's reporters do amazing work. We're honored to work with them. 

Lara Ceccarelli says she's had to revise what she's used to telling clients. Because referring people to the CFPB was a pretty regular part of herday to day works.

Lara: It makes a difference feeling like you've got a powerhouse at your back. You say, you know, the CFPB is incredibly solid, they will help support you. You know, all you have to do is reach out. They're communicative, and they are robust, and I can't say that anymore. 

Dan: There's still a website. There's still a phone number. 

Lara: But you're not getting a person right now. You're getting voicemails. So at this point, we're still advising clients that the CFPB is, you know, an important agency But we're also informing them that right now the CFPB is basically going dark,

Dan: So, she's telling people: Hey, it's worth calling the CFPB, just in case somebody picks up. But meanwhile here are some other places to call. 

Lara: I had a client who had been threatened by a debt collector, and the debt that they're collecting on is actually outside of the statute of limitations. It's not collectible anymore. But they're being harassed basically, you know, calling them at all hours of the day and night and advising them that, you know, they're still subject to legal action, none of which is true.

Dan: Which means, Lara tells me, that collector is breaking a law called the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. 

Lara: And normally I would have sent that client in the direction of the CFPB. 

Dan: Normally, you file a complaint with the CFPB, the company responds to you within 15 days, according to the agency's website.

Lara says companies pay attention– because the CFPB has a big stick. In 2023, the agency shut down one medical-debt collection company for violating this very law.

That version of normal is gone for now. But Lara happens to know, the Federal Trade Commission — which is still up and running– also has authority to enforce that law. They're not specialists, but they've got someone to answer the phones. So she encouraged her client to try them. 

Other folks, she's referring to their state attorney general's office. In a lot of states, consumer-protection is a big part of the state AG's job. Some state's have independent consumer protection bureaus. 

Lara and her colleagues respect the work they do. 

But it's not the same as having a powerful, national agency that enforces federal law.

Lara: You know, it wasn't something where somebody in Ohio has a different set of rules from somebody in California as far as where you go and who you contacted. Centralized enforcement and made it really easy for everybody to know where to go to get help with their particular issue. All these other different places, can sort of take up a piece of the enforcement action , but none of them have that same robust power that the CFPB had, or the direct focus specifically on financial institutions and and their interactions with consumers directly.

Dan: Lara and her colleagues are still there. She says their funding comes from private organizations, not the feds. 

Lara: We're not worried about the lights going out here yet

We all tried to lift each other up and, you know, talk about the other resources that we have available, all of which are valuable. and we have to, you know, maintain some degree of equilibrium, when you're speaking to clients that, you know, one of you could have a breakdown at a time, right?

And that's never our turn. So, um, you know, you have to maintain some degree of optimism and positivity, because if you're not optimistic and positive, for their outcomes. How can they possibly think there's hope for the future? 

Dan: Lara says she's doing her best at work– and working on keeping her balance. 

Lara:  I've got a beautiful little paint mare that I ride um, and I get to go out and play with her whenever the, uh, news gets too bleak. Normally, she gets, uh, one or two days without, you know, having to put up with me, but right now the need is dire.

Dan: Meanwhile, Chi Chi Wu is fighting. On two fronts. 

I mentioned earlier: Biden's CFPB took a big parting shot in early January. The agency finalized a rule banning medical debts from credit reports.

That rule got hit immediately with lawsuits from ACA International — that's the industry association for debt collectors — and the credit bureaus.

Chi Chi Wu and her colleagues at the National Consumer Law Center figured: The Trump Administration might not defend those lawsuits. 

So they started preparing motions to intervene: basically asking the court's permission to take over the defense. On the Sunday evening when Lara Ceccarelli read about the CFPB shutdown on the news, Chi Chi Wu was not watching the news.

Chi Chi Wu: I had been working like a mad woman that weekend 

Dan: Drafting documents for that motion to intervene.

Chi Chi Wu: So I was kind of busy all weekend, writing, not watching the Super Bowl

Dan: She got word from colleagues that Trump's people had shut down the CFPB, and she was like, ""OK. That going into this document I'm writing..""

Chi Chi Wu: …Because that was more support saying, well, the, this new CFPB is not going to defend this rule and so you should let us defend the rule.

Dan: Let us — the NCLC — defend the rule in court. 

So OK, that was material for her fight on one front. But of course it opens up another front, another legal battle. 

In this one, NCLC is actually a plaintiff — along with a union representing CFPB employees, and a couple other non profits. On February 13– four days after the CFPB went dark — they asked a federal judge, basically to stop the CFPB shutdown. 

The next day, the judge issued a temporary order, telling the CFPB to hold off on three things:

One. No more mass firings.

Two: Don't destroy data — or take data down from public websites.

And three: Don't return money to congress.

That order lasts just over two weeks, then there's a hearing scheduled. That's happening a few days after we publish this episode, and we'll be watching. . 

The other lawsuit, about the CFPB's rule on medical debt– it's on a slower timetable. 

Meanwhile, Chi Chi Wu says there are other fronts to fight on, and not just for her.

Chi Chi Wu: This is where states can step in and protect the consumers in their state. Nine states have already banned medical debt from credit reports. New York, Colorado, California, Rhode Island, even Virginia — a purple state. And so, if your listeners are wondering what can they do — I mean, you know, obviously contact their members of Congress to support the CFPB — but also, you know, if they are in a state that doesn't have one of these laws, they can try to get their state legislatures to pass a law to protect them from medical debts on credit reports.

Dan: We are gonna do our best to stay on top of this story.A few days after we publish this episode, there'll be that hearing in federal court on the lawsuit opposing the CFPB's shutdown. 

I'll post updates on the social networking site BlueSky — it's kind of a Twitter substitute, and you can find me there at danweissmann (spelled with two esses and two enns)

Next week's First Aid Kit newsletter will include a roundup of what we know, and what resources are available. If you're not signed up for First Aid Kit yet, just head to arm and a leg show, dot com, slash, first aid kit.

And we'll be back in a few weeks, with an episode about one listener's fight — successful fight — against a six thousand dollar charge. 

Megan: I didn't need to be an expert on this. I just needed to have access to the tools and the podcast would remind me of them. So I was like, okay, I'm so confident that I do not owe this and so that would get me, like, really amped up and angry about it.

Till then, take care of yourself.

After a patch of ice sent Marc Durocher hurtling to the ground, and doctors at UMass Memorial Medical Center repaired the broken hip that resulted, the 75-year-old electrician found himself at a crossroads.

He didn't need to be in the hospital any longer. But he was still in pain, unsteady on his feet, unready for independence.

Patients nationwide often stall at this intersection, stuck in the hospital for days or weeks because nursing homes and physical rehabilitation facilities are full. Yet when Durocher was ready for discharge in late January, a clinician came by with a surprising path forward: Want to go home?

Specifically, he was invited to join a research study at UMass Chan Medical School in Worcester, Massachusetts, testing the concept of ""SNF at home"" or ""subacute at home,"" in which services typically provided at a skilled nursing facility are instead offered in the home, with visits from caregivers and remote monitoring technology.

Durocher hesitated, worried he might not get the care he needed, but he and his wife, Jeanne, ultimately decided to try it. What could be better than recovering at his home in Auburn with his dog, Buddy?

Such rehab at home is underway in various parts of the country — including New York, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin — as a solution to a shortage of nursing home and rehab beds for patients too sick to go home but not sick enough to need hospitalization.

Staffing shortages at post-acute facilities around the country led to a 24% increase over three years in hospital length of stay among patients who need skilled nursing care, according to a 2022 analysis. With no place to go, these patients occupy expensive hospital beds they don't need, while others wait in emergency rooms for those spots. In Massachusetts, for example, at least 1,995 patients were awaiting hospital discharge in December, according to a survey of hospitals by the Massachusetts Health & Hospital Association.

Offering intensive services and remote monitoring technology in the home can work as an alternative — especially in rural areas, where nursing homes are closing at a faster rate than in cities and patients' relatives often must travel far to visit. For patients of the Marshfield Clinic Health System who live in rural parts of Wisconsin, the clinic's six-year-old SNF-at-home program is often the only option, said Swetha Gudibanda, medical director of the hospital-at-home program.

""This is going to be the future of medicine,"" Gudibanda said.

But the concept is new, an outgrowth of hospital-at-home services expanded by a covid-19 pandemic-inspired Medicare waiver. SNF-at-home care remains uncommon, lost in a fiscal and regulatory netherworld. No federal standards spell out how to run these programs, which patients should qualify, or what services to offer. No reimbursement mechanism exists, so fee-for-service Medicare and most insurance companies don't cover such care at home.

The programs have emerged only at a few hospital systems with their own insurance companies (like the Marshfield Clinic) or those that arrange for ""bundled payments,"" in which providers receive a set fee to manage an episode of care, as can occur with Medicare Advantage plans.

In Durocher's case, the care was available — at no cost to him or other patients — only through the clinical trial, funded by a grant from the state Medicaid program. State health officials supported two simultaneous studies at UMass and Mass General Brigham hoping to reduce costs, improve quality of care, and, crucially, make it easier to transition patients out of the hospital.

The American Health Care Association, the trade group of for-profit nursing homes, calls ""SNF at home"" a misnomer because, by law, such services must be provided in an institution and meet detailed requirements. And the association points out that skilled nursing facilities provide services and socialization that can never be replicated at home, such as daily activity programs, religious services, and access to social workers.

But patients at home tend to get up and move around more than those in a facility, speeding their recovery, said Wendy Mitchell, medical director of the UMass Chan clinical trial. Also, therapy is tailored to their home environment, teaching patients to navigate the exact stairs and bathrooms they'll eventually use on their own.

A quarter of people who go into nursing homes suffer an ""adverse event,"" such as infection or bed sore, said David Levine, clinical director for research for Mass General Brigham's Healthcare at Home program and leader of its study. ""We cause a lot of harm in facility-based care,"" he said.

By contrast, in 2024, not one patient in the Rehabilitation Care at Home program of Nashville-based Contessa Health developed a bed sore and only 0.3% came down with an infection while at home, according to internal company data. Contessa delivers care in the home through partnerships with five health systems, including Mount Sinai Health System in New York City, the Allegheny Health Network in Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin's Marshfield Clinic.

Contessa's program, which has been providing in-home post-hospital rehabilitation since 2019, depends on help from unpaid family caregivers. ""Almost universally, our patients have somebody living with them,"" said Robert Moskowitz, Contessa's acting president and chief medical officer.

The two Massachusetts-based studies, however, do enroll patients who live alone. In the UMass trial, an overnight home health aide can stay for a day or two if needed. And while alone, patients ""have a single-button access to a live person from our command center,"" said Apurv Soni, an assistant professor of medicine at UMass Chan and the leader of its study.

But SNF at home is not without hazards, and choosing the right patients to enroll is critical. The UMass research team learned an important lesson when a patient with mild dementia became alarmed by unfamiliar caregivers coming to her home. She was readmitted to the hospital, according to Mitchell.

The Mass General Brigham study relies heavily on technology intended to reduce the need for highly skilled staff. A nurse and physician each conducts an in-home visit, but the patient is otherwise monitored remotely. Medical assistants visit the home to gather data with a portable ultrasound, portable X-ray, and a device that can analyze blood tests on-site. A machine the size of a toaster oven dispenses medication, with a robotic arm that drops the pills into a dispensing unit.

The UMass trial, the one Durocher enrolled in, instead chose a ""light touch"" with technology, using only a few devices, Soni said.

The day Durocher went home, he said, a nurse met him there and showed him how to use a wireless blood pressure cuff, wireless pulse oximeter, and digital tablet that would transmit his vital signs twice a day. Over the next few days, he said, nurses came by to take blood samples and check on him. Physical and occupational therapists provided several hours of treatment every day, and a home health aide came a few hours a day. To his delight, the program even sent three meals a day.

Durocher learned to use the walker and how to get up the stairs to his bedroom with one crutch and support from his wife. After just one week, he transitioned to less-frequent, in-home physical therapy, covered by his insurance.

""The recovery is amazing because you're in your own setting,"" Durocher said. ""To be relegated to a chair and a walker, and at first somebody helping you get up, or into bed, showering you — it's very humbling. But it's comfortable. It's home, right?""

Death rates from breast cancer will fall in 2025 in every age group in the EU and the UK apart from in EU patients aged 80 years and older. In these older patients, overall mortality rates from the disease are predicted to rise by nearly 10% in 2025.

However, in the UK, breast cancer death rates are expected to decrease by 7% in this age group, compared to rates observed between 2015-2019. In Spain, there is also a 4% decrease in patients aged 80 and over.

These findings are from a new study published in the leading cancer journal Annals of Oncology today (Wednesday), which predicts death rates from cancer in the EU and UK for 2025.

Researchers led by Carlo La Vecchia (MD), Professor of Medical Statistics and Epidemiology at the University of Milan (Italy), suspect that the reason why death rates from breast cancer are increasing in older patients in the EU is because women aged 80 and older are not screened regularly for breast cancer and are less likely to receive the most up-to-date treatments.

Prof. La Vecchia said: ""Elderly women are not covered by screening and probably are less favourably affected by the substantial advances in breast cancer management, including improvements in chemo- and hormone therapy, such as trastuzumab and related drugs, but also in radiotherapy and surgery.

""The increased prevalence of overweight and obesity over the last few decades in most of northern and central Europe has led to an increased risk of breast cancer. In the elderly, this has not been counter-balanced by improved diagnosis and management. This accounts for the increased mortality in people aged 80 and over.""

Younger women aged between 20 to 49 years are usually not screened regularly either, but the experts predict death rates will fall by about 7% in this age group in the EU and by almost 15% in the UK, compared to death rates seen between 2015-2019.

Prof. La Vecchia and colleagues predict that, compared to death rates in 2020, breast cancer rates overall will fall by 4% in the EU and by 6% in the UK in 2025. The age standardised mortality rate (ASMR) in the EU will be 13.3 deaths per 100,000 of the female population (a total of 90,100 deaths) and 13.2 per 100,000 in the UK (a total of 11,400 deaths).

The rates vary by country and age group. In Germany, overall breast cancer death rates will fall by 14%, in the UK by 10%, in Poland by 9%, in France and Spain by 8%, and in Italy by 2%. Across all age groups, breast cancer death rates will fall by 7%-12% in the EU in different age groups, with the exception of women aged 80 and over where there will be an increase in the EU, apart from Spain.

""We estimate that between 1989 and 2025, 373,000 breast cancer deaths have been avoided in the EU and 197,000 in the UK. Most of these are due to improved management and therapy, but 25-30% are likely to be attributable to more widespread screening and early diagnosis,"" said Prof. La Vecchia.

""Given that breast cancer is now a largely curable cancer that requires modern integrated approaches, it is essential that all diagnoses of breast cancer are referred to comprehensive cancer centres, which can offer the complete range of therapies that might be required.

""As indicated by the unfavorable trends in elderly women, control of overweight and obesity is a priority now, not only for cardiovascular diseases, but also for cancer, including breast cancer.""

The researchers analyzed cancer death rates in the EU 27 Member States as a whole and separately in the UK. They looked at the five most populous EU countries (France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain) and, individually, for stomach, intestines, pancreas, lung, breast, uterus (including cervix), ovary, prostate, bladder and leukemias for men and women]. Prof. La Vecchia and his colleagues collected data on deaths from the World Health Organization and United Nations databases from 1970 to 2021 for most of the EU-27 and the UK. This is the fifteenth consecutive year the researchers have published these predictions, which have proved to be reliable over the years.

In the EU-27 countries, they predict there will be a 3.5% fall in the age-standardized death rates for all cancers from 125 per 100,000 of the population in 2020 to 121 per 100,000 in 2025 for men, and a 1% fall from 80 to 79 per 100,000 among women. A total of approximately 1,280,000 people will die from the disease in the EU and 173,000 in the UK.

In the UK, the age-standardized death rate for all cancers in men will fall by 10% from 112 to 101 per 100,000, and by 6% from 87.6 to 82 per 100,000 among women in 2025.

However, due to the increasing numbers of elderly people in the population, the actual number of deaths from cancer will rise from 671,963 in 2020 to 709,400 men in the EU in 2025, and from 537,866 to 570,500 women. In the UK, the number of deaths will rise from 91,239 to 92,200 men and from 80,378 to 81,100 women.

Death rates from most cancers are predicted to fall this year in the EU, with the exception of pancreatic cancer: up 2% in men and 3% in women. In women, lung cancer is also predicted to rise by nearly 4%, and bladder cancer will rise by nearly 2%.

In the UK, the only death rates predicted to rise are those for bowel cancer in women and in the uterus (both by less than 1%). Death rates from all other cancers are falling in both sexes.

Smoking remains by far the major recognised cause of pancreatic cancer, accounting for 20 to 35% of cases in various populations and age groups, according to their different smoking habits. Diabetes, being overweight and developing the metabolic syndrome account for around 5% of pancreatic cancers in Europe. This is becoming more and more important following the increasing prevalence of obesity, but control and avoidance of smoking remains the top priority for pancreatic cancer control.""

Prof. Eva Negri from the University of Bologna (Italy), co-leader of the research

Over 37 years between 1988 and 2025, the researchers calculated the number of cancer deaths avoided, assuming that rates remained constant at the 1988 rates. They estimate that a total of 6.8 million deaths from all cancers have been avoided in the EU (4,700,000 in men and 2,100,000 in women), and a total of 1,500,000 in the UK (1 million in men and 500,000 in women).

Lung cancer will kill the greatest absolute number of men in both the EU and the UK (151,000 and 16,700 respectively), and among women in the UK (15,500). In the EU, breast cancer will kill the greatest number of EU women, but the predicted death rate from lung cancer is now slightly higher than breast cancer in these women and is increasing (up 3.8%), whereas it is falling for breast cancer (down 3.6%).

Prof. La Vecchia concluded: ""Trends in cancer mortality continue to be favourable across Europe. However, there are a few negative indications. These include deaths from bowel cancer in people younger than 50, which have started to increase in the UK and several central and northern Europe countries, mainly due to increased prevalence of overweight and obesity in the young who are not covered by colorectal cancer screening.

""In addition, death rates from pancreatic cancer are not decreasing in the EU, and it is now the fourth cause of cancer death in Europe after lung, colorectal and breast cancer. Death rates from lung cancer are starting to level off but not yet to decrease in EU women. The trends in pancreatic and female lung cancer underline the urgency of implementing stricter tobacco control across Europe.""

Republican Rep. Keith Self of Texas abruptly adjourned a subcommittee meeting after he caught flak for repeatedly misgendering Rep. Sarah McBride (D-Del.), the first openly transgender member of Congress and a frequent target of right-wing bullies.

The incident unfolded during a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee hearing on Tuesday when Self, who chairs the subcommittee on Europe, handed the floor over to McBride, referring to her as “Mr. McBride.”

Without skipping a beat, McBride briefly grimaced and responded, “Thank you, Madam Chair,” and began speaking. Then ranking member Rep. Bill Keating (D-Mass.) cut in, demanding accountability from Self.

“Mr. Chairman, could you repeat your introduction again, please?” Keating said to Self. Flustered, Self began to defend himself: “Yes, it's a ― we have set the standard on the floor of the House, and I'm simply ―” he said until Keating cut in again.

“What is that standard? Mr. Chairman?” Keating asked. “Would you repeat what you just said when you introduced a duly elected representative from the United States of America, please?”

Self responded by misgendering McBride again. “I will. The representative from Delaware, Mr. McBride,” he said.

Keating grew firmer as the exchange heated up.

“Mr. Chairman, you are out of order. Mr. Chairman, have you no decency? I mean, I have come to know you a little bit, but this is not decent,” he said.

When Self said he'd like to continue on with the meeting, Keating pushed back: “We will continue this. You will not continue it with me unless you introduce a duly elected representative the right way.”

Self immediately banged the gavel and adjourned the meeting. Keating slammed his notebook shut and stood up to leave.

Self reposted a video of the incident on social media and wrote, “It is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female.” He also reposted support from Rep. Mary Miller (R-Ill.), who used McBride's deadname from before her transition. “Enough with the lies,” Miller wrote. “As God ordained and President Trump declared, there are only TWO GENDERS: Male and Female!”

McBride's legally recognized gender is female, one of the two that Self and Miller claim is acceptable.

Self didn't respond to requests for further comment on the incident, and neither did McBride nor Keating.

EXCLUSIVE — The House GOP's campaign committee is taking aim at congressional Democrats for voting against a measure to fund the federal government through Sept. 30 and avoid a government shutdown at the end of this week.

The National Republican Congressional Committee is launching digital ads against 35 House Democrats who may face challenging or competitive races in the 2026 midterms, when the GOP aims to defend its fragile majority in the chamber.

The spots, shared first with Fox News Wednesday morning, are going up hours after the House, almost entirely along party lines, voted 217-213 to pass a Republican-crafted bill that cuts non-defense spending by roughly $13 billion, boosts defense spending by around $6 billion and gives President Donald Trump more leeway in how to spend the funds.

Thanks to heavy last-minute lobbying by Trump and his allies inside and outside the chamber, the House GOP didn't need a single Democrat's vote to pass the bill.

One Democrat, moderate Jared Golden of Maine, who represents a district carried by Trump the past three presidential elections, voted for the Republican measure.

And the one Republican to vote against the bill, far right Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, is being threatened by Trump and his allies with a possible primary challenge next year when he's up for re-election.

The digital ads by the NRCC, which are identical for all the targets, will run online in the districts of Democratic representatives Josh Harder (CA-09), Adam Gray (CA-13), Jim Costa, (CA-21), Raul Ruiz (CA-25), George Whitesides (CA-27), Derek Tran (CA-45), Dave Min (CA-47) and Mike Levin (CA-49) of California; Darren Soto (FL-09) and Jared Moskowitz (FL-23) of Florida; Eric Sorensen (IL-17) of Illinois; Frank Mrvan (IN-01) of Indiana; Kristen McDonald Rivet (MN-08) of Michigan; Don Davis (NC-01) of North Carolina; Chris Pappas (NH-01) and Maggie Goodlander (NH-02) of New Hampshire; Josh Gottheimer (NJ-05) and Nellie Pou (NJ-09) of New Jersey; Gabe Vasquez (NM-02) of New Mexico; Dina Titus (NV-01), Susie Lee (NV-03) and Steven Horsford (NV-04) of Nevada; Tom Suozzi (NY-03), Laura Gillen (NY-04), Pat Ryan (NY-18) and Josh Riley (NY-19) of New York; Greg Landsman (OH-01), Marcy Kaptur (OH-09), and Emilia Syles (OH-13) of Ohio; Janelle Bynum (OR-05) of Oregon; Henry Cuellar (TX-28) and Vicente Gonzalez (TX-34) of Texas; Eugene Vindman (VA-07) of Virginia; and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (WA-03) of Washington state.

The NRCC says there's a modest ad buy behind the digital spots.

""House Democrats threw a tantrum at the expense of the American people, shutting down the government just to score political points. After months of failure, they've learned nothing and doubled down on their embarrassing dysfunction."" NRCC spokesman Mike Marinella said.

The number of people who are dying due to alcohol in Wales has hit a record high. The latest figures on substance misuse from Public Health Wales revealed that there were 562 fatalities recorded as alcohol-specific deaths in Wales in 2023.

The new data has shown that alcohol-related deaths and hospital admissions also continuing to rise. The report highlighted that deprivation plays a significant role in these issues, with individuals from the most deprived areas in Wales 2.8 times more likely to be admitted for alcohol-specific conditions than those from the least deprived areas.

The record high number of alcohol-specific deaths - those from conditions wholly or partially caused by alcohol - is up 15.6 per cent from the previous year, and a significant rise from 10 years before, when there 351 alcohol-specific deaths in 2014. Of the alcohol-specific deaths in 2023, nearly two thirds involved males.

Furthermore, there were 683 alcohol-related deaths in Wales in 2023, which represents a 10.5 per cent from the previous year (618) and a substantial rise from a decade before (462). The data also shows that alcohol-specific hospital admissions continue to rise with over 12,000 admissions. Older adults aged 50+ made up two thirds of those cases.

Highest admission rates were recorded in Merthyr Tydfil with, 397 admissions per 100,000 people, more than double the rate in Powys, where admissions were lowest. Alcohol-specific hospital admissions for those under 25 declined by 17.4 percent compared to the previous year, but school exclusions related to drugs and alcohol reached a new record high of 939 cases in the 2022/23 academic year.

Prof Rick Lines, head of the substance misuse programme at Public Health Wales, said: ""The impacts of the harmful use of alcohol continue to be a concern across Wales, both in terms of drug related deaths in which alcohol is a factor as well as the long-term health effects of alcohol.

""Access to substance misuse services for people who experience problematic alcohol use continues to be an important intervention. However, it's important to recognise the risk of harm even among those who do not require treatment services.""

Helen Erswell, a consultant in public health at Public Health Wales, said: ""This report highlights the stark health inequalities in Wales, showing that individuals in the most deprived areas are disproportionately affected by alcohol-related issues.

""It underscores the vital need for investment in prevention-focused initiatives that can reduce future health risks, ultimately supporting longer, healthier lives for everyone in Wales.""

The prospect of deep Medicaid cuts has become a flashpoint in Congress, with leaders of both parties accusing their counterparts of lying.

House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said Feb. 27 that a Republican budget measure would ""set in motion the largest cut to Medicaid in American history,"" and Republicans are hiding the consequences.

""The Republicans are lying to the American people about Medicaid,"" Jeffries said. ""I can't say it any other way. Republicans are lying. Prove me wrong.""

Republicans said Democrats were distorting the Republican budget. Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., said, ""The word Medicaid is not even in this bill.""

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said on CNN that Republicans don't want to cut Medicaid, ""and the Democrats have been lying about it.""

Republicans are looking for massive budget savings to meet their goal of fully extending President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts. This is a separate process from Congress' need to pass a continuing resolution to keep the government running by March 14 or else face a federal government shutdown.

Here's what we know so far about potential Medicaid cuts.

Medicaid serves about one in five Americans. The health care program for low-income people is paid for by the federal government and partly by states. Louisiana, home to Johnson and Scalise, has one of the highest state proportions of Medicaid enrollees.

The House Republican budget plan adopted Feb. 25 opens the door to slashing Medicaid, even though it doesn't name the program.

The plan directs the House Energy and Commerce Committee to find ways to cut the deficit by at least $880 billion over the next decade.

The committee has jurisdiction over Medicaid, Medicare and the Children's Health Insurance Program, in addition to much smaller programs. CHIP offers low-cost health coverage to children in families that earn too much money to qualify for Medicaid.

Republicans ruled out cuts to Medicare, the health insurance program for seniors that leaders cut at their political peril. Medicare is about 15% of the federal budget, and Medicaid is about 8.6%.

When Medicare is set aside, Medicaid accounts for 93% of the funding under the committee's jurisdiction, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found in a March 5 analysis. That means it is impossible for the committee to find enough cuts that don't affect Medicaid.

""It's a fantasy to imply that federal Medicaid assistance won't be cut very deeply,"" said Allison Orris, an expert on Medicaid policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank.

After Medicaid, the next largest program under the committee's jurisdiction is CHIP. Lawmakers don't appear to be planning to wipe out CHIP, but even if they did, they would only be a ""fraction of the way there,"" said Joan Alker, an expert on Medicaid and CHIP at Georgetown University.

If Medicare cuts are off the table, the only way to achieve $880 billion in savings is through big Medicaid cuts, said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, a health policy organization.

Andy Schneider, a professor at Georgetown who served in the Obama administration as a senior adviser at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said even if the committee eliminated all of those ""other"" programs entirely it could only achieve $381 billion in savings — about 43% of the target.

""In short, if they don't want to cut Medicaid (or CHIP), and they don't want to cut Medicare, the goal of cutting $880 billion is impossible,"" Schneider said.

The $880 billion cut is not a done deal. House Republicans were able to pass their budget package, but Senate Republicans are taking a different approach, without proposing such significant cuts.

Any finalized budget blueprint would need Senate Republicans' buy-in. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., is among Republicans who have spoken against potential cuts; he told HuffPost, ""I would not do severe cuts to Medicaid.""

The numbers are starting points that may lead to negotiation among at least Republicans, Joe Antos, a health care expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said. ""We are a long way from final legislation, so it's not possible to predict how much any program will be cut,"" he said.

""If the bill also includes extending the (Trump 2017) tax cuts, we are probably months away from seeing real language,"" Antos said.

Once the House and Senate have reached an agreement on language and the resolution passes both chambers, the committees will work on detailed cuts. To enact such cuts, both chambers would need to approve a separate bill and receive Trump's signature.

Republican leaders have deflected concerns about Medicaid cuts by talking about a different target: Medicaid fraud.

""I'm not going to touch Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. Now, we're going to get fraud out of there,"" Trump told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on March 9, in keeping with his campaign rhetoric that he would protect those programs.

At the same time, Trump praised the House resolution that would make cuts highly likely: ""The House Resolution implements my FULL America First Agenda, EVERYTHING, not just parts of it!""

Would eliminating fraud solve the Medicaid problem? No.

On CNN, Johnson said cutting fraud, waste and abuse would result in ""part of the savings to accomplish this mission."" He said the government loses $50 billion a year in Medicaid payments ""just in fraud alone.""

Johnson conflated ""fraud"" with ""improper payments."" The Government Accountability Office, the nonpartisan investigative arm that examines the use of public funds, found about $50 billion in improper payments in Medicaid and the same amount in Medicare in 2023.

Those improper payments were made in an incorrect amount (overpayment or underpayment), should not have been made at all, or had missing or insufficient documentation. But that doesn't mean that there was $50 billion in Medicaid fraud, which would involve obtaining something through willful misrepresentation.

The system used to identify improper payments is not designed to measure fraud, so we don't know what percentage of improper payments were losses due to fraud, said Schneider, the former Obama administration health adviser.

Plus, it's a drop in the overall bucket of the potential $880 billion in cuts.

The Trump administration is bent on repealing or ignoring just about every law that gets in the way of its drive to remake the federal government.

But the administration can't repeal the law of unintended consequences. And plenty of people outside the executive branch — particularly health care providers, mental health professionals, and social workers — will have to clean up the messes the president's directives are creating.

Consider the human cost of the administration's mass culling of federal workers. Some experts estimate that nearly a half-million federal workers could be laid off within the next two years. That's roughly 20% of the federal workforce. It would represent the largest mass firing in American history.

Certain regions of the country — like the Washington, D.C., area — are especially vulnerable to economic disruption. But there are 35 states with at least one county where close to 5% of civilian employees are federal workers.

By the time the long-term effects of these firings filter through our society, the Trump administration will be long gone.

Researchers have investigated just this kind of mass firing event, like a factory closure where an entire workforce is shown the door at the same time. Nearly all of those fired workers experienced mental health declines. The longer their unemployment lasts, the worse they fared.

Even without serious financial strain — if a spouse, for example, has secure employment — losing a job can be highly detrimental to mental health. Removing a person's daily routine as well as their sense of purpose and identity can seriously undermine their sense of self.

Our nation is already experiencing a mental health crisis. Suicide rates are rising. The number of deaths by drug overdose has quintupled in the last quarter-century. Some 29 million people are struggling with alcohol use disorder.

Putting hundreds of thousands of federal employees out of work will only make such mental health challenges more prevalent.

Or take the administration's crackdown on undocumented migrants. The president has given immigration authorities permission to enter schools, health care facilities, and houses of worship to arrest people suspected of being undocumented.

Many migrants have lived in the United States for years and may have nowhere else to go. Others may not be safe if they return to the places they were born. Terror and trauma are already sweeping migrant communities.

This crackdown has the potential to traumatize U.S. citizens, too. Churches, schools and community organizations are preparing for the possibility that federal agents may invade their grounds in search of people suspected of being undocumented.

How are teachers supposed to explain to their students why federal agents are removing their peers from class? Are priests expected to pause their sermons while immigration officials drag congregants from their pews for deportation?

The administration's assault on transgender people will also make our nation's mental health crisis worse. Denying access to gender-affirming care, as the Trump administration aims to do, increases the risk that a person will experience depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation. And it's at odds with the recommendations of major medical organizations.

Local public health workers, especially social workers, will be the ones who have to help communities navigate the mental health challenges that the administration's blitz of executive orders has wrought.

Nearly 40% of America's 750,000 social workers specialize in adult mental health. We are crucial pieces of the nation's healthcare infrastructure. Many of us have completed advanced training; four in five have a master's degree, with hundreds of hours of field work as part of the requirement.

Unfortunately, there are not enough social workers to meet the increasing demand for our services. We need to bolster public support for social workers, promote awareness of the valuable services we provide, and amplify recruitment efforts to attract new people to the profession.

That's especially true now that millions of vulnerable Americans have found themselves targets of this administration.","{'href': 'https://news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News'}"

Zeeko Zaki is just like Us and enjoys seeing OA, Maggie and Scola work as a trio on FBI — but he teased that their smaller team won't last much longer.

After special agent Stuart Scola's (John Boyd) partner Tiffany “Tiff” Wallace (Katherine Renee Kane) exited the series at the start of season 7, Scola hasn't found a new forever partner. Instead, he's worked alongside partners Maggie Bell (Missy Peregrym) and Omar Adom “OA” Zidan (Zaki) on and off.



“It's [the] Three Musketeers for a minute,” Zaki, 35, exclusively told Us Weekly about the team dynamics the remainder of the season. “But we do introduce a fourth agent.”

The actor played coy about whether this new addition will stick. “Hopefully, it all works out and we'll see if it's for the long run,” Zaki continued, noting, “We do introduce a fourth agent in the next few episodes and it's exciting.”

Earlier this season, Scola was briefly paired with Sydney Ortiz (Lisette Olivera). However, she left for a different gig with the bureau after episode 8.

Since then, Scola has teamed up with both Maggie and OA together as well as partnering with them one-on-one. That dynamic is something Zaki told Us will continue before the new agent joins the force.

“What's kind of exciting [with] the next few episodes [is] the ones that we all have off sort of line up,” Zaki shared. “You're going to see a lot more of one of us not being there and things like that.”

Even with the mixing of partners, Zaki said it will be seamless on the job. “We've all been working together now for six years. [OA] and Maggie seven, but Scola came in season 2, so the dynamic between the three of us is always really great,” he explained.

The personal shakeup, however, does mean that Maggie and OA, who have worked together since season 1 of the series, have been apart for a significant amount of time.

“It tees us up for a great kind of reunion moment for Maggie and OA when we get back together on screen,” Zaki teased. “It's a fun new sort of thing to play.”

No matter what the pairing, Zaki promised a lot of high intensity cases to wrap up the remainder of the season. (During the Tuesday, March 11, episode, OA took down a group of train hijackers solo while trying to protect his girlfriend, Gemma, who was accidentally shot in the attack.)

“We face some eco terrorists, we face some cartel, we get some more traditional cases here and there,” he told Us, adding, “The stakes keep rising and somehow we keep finding a way to do these really exciting episodes.”

Zaki noted that FBI's final two episodes have yet to film, so he's not sure what the finale will entail. However, based on past patterns, he is hopeful OA will be front and center for them both.

“Usually, OA gets a heavy one in the last few [episodes]. So we'll see if there's one more in the bucket for him,” he shared.

What Zaki does know is that the team will be “trying to find our new balance with four agents at the end of the season.”

Bravo stars Dorit Kemsley and Tracy Tutor are exchanging a war of words.

Million Dollar Listing Los Angeles star Tutor, 49, accused Kemsley, 48, of not paying her glam squad and stalking her Instagram during a Tuesday, March 11, interview on SiriusXM's Jeff Lewis Live. Later, Kemsley clapped back during her own interview on Bravo's Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen.

Tutor spoke about celebrity hairstylist Chris Dylan during her interview with Jeff Lewis, noting that he does Kathy Hilton's hair for The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. “He used to do Dorit, but that's over. Because she doesn't pay her bills,” she claimed.

“Based on my knowledge, there's several people that haven't been paid by her, including my stylist, who I think she just tallied up with finally, [and] my makeup artist,” Tutor further claimed. “She's got my people, yet she likes to throw shade and call me a ‘tacky woman.'”



“She likes to apparently stalk my Instagram and the people that I use [for glam],” Tutor added.

RHOBH veteran Kemsley was later asked about Tutor's comments Tuesday night on Watch What Happens Live.

“It's hysterical. That's the funniest thing I've ever heard, like wholeheartedly. There was a lot of s— that she said that, I don't know, it came out of left field,” Kemsley said.



According to Kemsley, “In particular, her talking about Chris Dylan, a hairstylist that I worked with this year for the first time in eight years. … He sent an invoice overcharging me and charging me for a hotel that he'd already used my card to pay for.”

“I think he was just trying to bully this invoice through, not realizing that it goes through a process and my office flagged it,” Kemsley claimed. “When they had written back, ‘This has already been paid,' it was like, ‘Oh s—, I didn't get away with that?' Obviously, he needed to resend an invoice.”

Us Weekly has reached out to Dylan for comment.

As for Tutor, Kemsley said, “Her going on [Jeff Lewis Live] and talking about something she knows nothing about, it seems more like attention-seeking than anything.”

The drama between the two Bravo stars spilled over onto social media. After Lewis posted a clip of Tutor's appearance on his radio show via his Instagram Tuesday, Dylan commented on the post, “After months of begging finally paid in full thank you guys 👏😍 @tracytutor @jljefflewis.”

“@chrisdylanx sometimes you gotta blow the bridge baby. Well done ❤️,” Tutor responded.

In the comments section, Tutor further alleged that Kemsley had “talked s— about me to my team.” (Kemsley did not directly address this claim during her WWHL appearance or via social media.)

Tutor also weighed in under an Instagram post sharing a clip of Kemsley's comments on WWHL. “Guess who got his wire transfer today though 😎,” the reality star wrote under the official WWHL account's post.

The Traitors season 3 winner Gabby Windey is still waiting for her prize money!

The former Bachelorette jointly won the latest season of Peacock's hit game show alongside Dylan Efron, Dolores Catania and Lord Ivar Mountbatten. However, she joked that she still hasn't “seen a dime” of the over $50,000 she earned during the Thursday, March 6, finale.



Appearing on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen on Tuesday, March 11, Gabby, 34, was asked to name her rose and thorn — her favorite and least favorite memories — of filming the reality show last summer in Scotland.

For her rose, Gabby said, “Winning, 100%. Yeah, obviously.”



A post shared by Watch What Happens Live! (@bravowwhl)



She went on to quip, “Still haven't seen a dime — everybody knows here at Bravo, NBC, Peacock.”

As for her thorn? “Not receiving my money. I'm still waiting on my money,” Gabby quipped to chuckles from host Andy Cohen, who assured her she would get it.

Gabby, Dolores, 53, Dylan, 33, and Ivar, 62, all proved they were Faithfuls in the final banishment of season 3, thus splitting a prize fund of $204,300.

“We did it! Despite all the odds, we are the most Faithfuls to ever win and honestly it feels so good,” Gabby said after the final banishment. “But life has taught me that doing the hard thing and doing the right thing are often the same. But you will get an even greater reward.”

Dylan reflected on the moment as well, saying, ”We went against some of the best gamers in the world and we won this game. It is hard to believe. That is the underdog story right there.”

On Tuesday's WWHL, Dylan also shared his highlight — and lowlight — from filming Traitors.

“My rose was honestly getting to play with 20 people that I looked up to and watched on TV. That was the best part about it,” Dylan shared, noting that his thorn was the catering provided to the cast. (Mexican day, in particular, was “bad,” he said.)

As well as celebrating her Traitors victory, Gabby also revealed last week that she tied the knot with writer and comedian Robby Hoffman.

The couple broke news of their secret Las Vegas wedding in an interview with Cosmopolitan published on Wednesday, March 5. “We had just evacuated from the [Los Angeles] fires. Literally cue Rihanna, ‘We found love in a hopeless place,'” Gabby told the outlet. “What better time to get married than right now? Because if the world is ending, we want to be with each other.”

Gabby revealed it was her idea to get married, sharing, “Robby was literally ready to propose three weeks in and I'm always the one pumping the breaks, but when something feels right, it just feels right. I think it was better for the both of us that it was my idea.”

Dwyane Wade is weighing in on the battle between LeBron James and ESPN's Stephen A. Smith.

“I love both guys,” Wade, 43, told TMZ in a video published on Wednesday, March 12. “I had a conversation with Stephen A. about it and I told him if I was LeBron, I would have walked up on him the same way.”

Wade's comment comes shortly after Smith, 57, brought up James' “weak” confrontation during an episode of “Gil's Take,” which aired on Tuesday, March 11.

“I thought it was some bulls—,” Smith said. “But in the moment, I knew that I was listening to a father.”



Earlier this month, video footage went viral of James, 40, and Smith, 57, having what looked like a heated exchange after the Los Angeles Lakers beat the New York Knicks on March 6. The following day, Smith confirmed that they exchanged words over LeBron's son Bronny James, who joined his dad on the Lakers this season.

“That was LeBron James coming up to me, unexpectedly I might add, to confront me about making sure that I mind what I say about his son,” Smith said on ESPN's First Take on March 7. “Can't repeat the words because they ain't suited for FCC airwaves. That's what he was doing.”

The sports reporter explained that the confrontation becoming so viral made acknowledging what happened “unavoidable.”

“I thought long and hard about this over the last few hours, because I had no intention of talking about this at all,” Smith continued. “The reason why is because it was a one-on-one — I wouldn't say it was a conversation — but it was a one-on-one confrontation.”

Smith has publicly criticized Bronny, 20, after he went pro in 2024. In January, Smith was “pleading” with LeBron to keep Bronny off the court.

When addressing their sideline chat, Smith confirmed that LeBron “clearly took exception to some of the things he heard me say.” While he somewhat understood LeBron's move, Smith wished they spoke on the phone instead.

“That wasn't a basketball player confronting me,” Smith said on First Take. “That was a parent. That was a father. I can't sit here and be angry or feel slighted by LeBron James in any way in that regard. By all accounts, he's obviously a wonderful family man and father. He cares very, very deeply about his son.”

Tyler Cameron's hometown date on The Bachelorette season 15 wasn't actually filmed in his own house.

“My mom busted her a– [and] I learned she painted the house, she had my aunts, uncles [and] everyone over there working their tails off to get this house looking good,” Cameron, 32, recalled in a Tuesday, March 11, TikTok video. “It was really beat-up and as she did all that work, the Bachelorette producers told us, ‘It's too small. It's not going to work.'”

According to Cameron, his family hosted lead Hannah Brown “from my cousin's house.”

“We hosted the dinner and hangout there,” Cameron recalled. “I was very upset about this. I was like, ‘I grew up in this house. I've lived there since I was a baby. It's the first house I lived in. This means a lot to me.' Didn't matter.”



Cameron appeared on Brown's season of The Bachelorette in 2019, eventually introducing her to his loved ones during a Florida hometown date. In addition to meeting his whole family at a cousin's residence, the contractor took Brown, now 30, on a boat excursion.

“To make matters worse, the boat that I went on wasn't even my boat. And why? Because they said my boat was too small,” he further claimed. “I told Hannah. I was like, ‘This isn't my boat. This isn't my house. I'm not trying to front.'”

According to Cameron, he was “pissed off” that he couldn't film in his real properties. (The Bachelor franchise has not publicly addressed Cameron's claims though many other show alums have also alleged they filmed hometowns in different houses for similar reasons.)

“But, it is what it is. I can't do anything about it,” Cameron concluded. “Lesson of the story: It's not about the size of the boat, it's about the size of the motion in the ocean. That's all.”

He added, “It pisses me off when they do that, like, let's be real. [I'll] show you my little-a– house that I grew up in since I was a baby, show you the holes in the wall. I don't care.”

Cameron was the runner-up on Brown's season and they've since remained friendly as they each romantically moved on with Tate Madden and Adam Woolard, respectively. He even reunited with Brown for a 2024 episode of his Going Home renovation docuseries.

“I really had a call and a favor for her,” Cameron exclusively told Us Weekly in April 2024. “I really needed her to do this for me because my designer Jess [Quintero] was too busy. She's like, ‘Ty, I can't do this anymore.' I go, ‘Jess, this is my dream home to renovate. We have to find a way to do this.'”

He added, “[Hannah] came down and she was a rock star. She had a beautiful design. She worked her butt off and she was a complete pro and just so great to work with. I think we had to iron some things out, but I thought we worked out honestly better than expected. I was curious to see how it was going to be, but she's such a trooper and she did such a great job.”

Brown worked as an interior designer before appearing on Colton Underwood's season of The Bachelor, which aired ahead of her own journey as the lead.

Nope, Scarlett Johansson is not on Instagram and she also has no plans in the future to join the social media app.

“I got close enough to talk to my therapist about it. I was like, I guess this is something I need to do. But it goes against my core values,"" Scarlett told InStyle. ""I think it was more about: How do I express that, too? Because there's so much expectation from...”

Benson Boone is opening up about showing off his body!

The 22-year-old Grammy-nominated singer has seemingly not been shy about himself, as he has become quite known for going shirtless at concerts, or being seen wearing just a speedo. 

In a new interview with Rolling Stone, Benson dished on his relationship with his body, his lack of focusing on his body ""all the time,"" and why he couldn't be the ""sex icon of the century.""

Keep reading to find out more...

“I definitely remember there was a time where I would take my shirt off because I didn't know what else to do,” he told the mag. “After doing a lot of shows, you start to pick up on what people like and don't like, what girls like and don't like. There is an art to making anybody go crazy.… I also don't want people to come to a show expecting me to just take my shirt off and it to be like a gun show. One, I don't have the guns for that. Two, that's just not what I'm about.… I don't want to rely on my physical form to be the primary driver of my shows.”

Benson notes that some of his discomfort is from his own self-consciousness. 

""It  sucks to just focus on that all the time,” the singer said of working out. “Because I'm so incredibly hard on myself, and when I start to think about my appearance too much, it just kills me because there's always something more I could do. There's always a hairstyle or, like, my arms could be bigger. My shoulders could be bigger. It's never-ending. I can't afford to think that way because I will never be happy if I do think that way.” 

“Dude, it affects me so much,” Benson adds of body image struggles. “Obviously, like, I enjoy working out and I want to keep my physical shape because I need to. But I can't be the sex icon of the ­century, just because that's not who I am.”

If you missed it, Benson recently dropped his latest single, ""Sorry I'm Here For Someone Else.""

Dune: Part Two picked up a couple Oscar wins this month and fans are very excited about another movie being added to the franchise in the future. 

Director Denis Villeneuve recently shared details about the upcoming installment, which seemingly will be the final one in the series.

“I'm in the writing zone right now,” he told Deadline in an October 2024 interview, adding that the next movie will be completely different than the first two films.

“I think it'll be a great idea to do something completely different. The story takes place like 12 years after where we left the characters at the end of Part Two. Their journey, their story is different this time, and that's why I always say that while it's the same world it's a new film with new circumstances,” Denis said. 

While there are more books in the Dune series following Dune: Messiah, Denis says the upcoming third movie “will finish the Paul Atreides arc.”

Denis also confirmed four actors “have to return. They are with the main cast when it happens. And more worms. What can I say?” We are expecting that five more actors will likely be back too and there are five stars we don't think will return.

Landman is returning for a second season at Paramount+!

“Landman was one of the biggest shows of the year because of Taylor Sheridan's unique ability to tap into the cultural zeitgeist, harnessing the Neo-western themes of rugged individualism, ambition and working-class struggles set against contemporary debates around energy, climate change and economic growth. The series has helped drive Paramount+ to new heights as the No. 2 SVOD [service] in the U.S. for original hours watched in Q4,” Chris McCarthy, co-CEO of Paramount and president and CEO of Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios and Paramount Media Networks, said in a statement.

Billy Bob Thornton, Demi Moore, Andy Garcia, Ali Larter, Jacob Lofland, Michelle Randolph, Kayla Wallace, and more star.

Paramount+ canceled one other TV show this year, while they also renewed a huge hit.","{'href': 'https://www.justjared.com', 'title': 'Just Jared'}"

Tiger Woods is at home recovering after an injury. 

The 49-year-old PGA Tour champion revealed on Tuesday (March 11) that he has suffered a ruptured Achilles tendon and had to undergo surgery. 

This means that the golfer will not be able to participate in the upcoming 2025 Masters Tournament next month.

""As I began to ramp up my own training and practice at home, I felt a sharp pain in my left Achilles, which was deemed to be ruptured,"" Tiger shared on Instagram. ""This morning, Dr. Charlton Stucken of Hospital for Special Surgery in West Palm Beach, Florida performed a minimally-invasive Achilles tendon repair for a ruptured tendon.""

He added a quote from the doctor, ""The surgery went smoothly, and we expect a full recovery.""

Tiger concluded his post, ""I am back home now and plan to focus on my recovery and rehab, thank you for all the support.""

Last year, two-time Masters champion Bernhard Langer also had an Achilles tendon tear, and he was out for three months!

At the 2024 Masters, Tiger set the tournament record by making the cut for the 24th time in a row.

Sadie Sink has landed a very exciting new role!

The 22-year-old actress is set to join the MCU in the upcoming fourth Spider-Man movie, alongside Tom Holland, according to Deadline. 

There have been rumors swirling about her involvement in the MCU and now it's being confirmed - part of it, at least.

Keep reading to find out more...

As is the case with most things related to the MCU, Sadie's role is currently being kept under wraps and is unknown, though it's been rumored she will be the new Jean Grey from X-Men. 

Given Sadie is a red-head, there is also the possibility of her coming in to play Mary Jane Watson, one of Peter Parker's most well known love interests, though Zendaya's character Michelle ""MJ"" Jones was based on Mary Jane and seemingly took over that character. 

However, given the multiverse and everyone's memories of Spider-Man and Peter being erased, anything is possible!

Stay tuned as we learn more... 

Spider-Man 4 is set to be directed by Shang-Chi's Destin Daniel Cretton. Just a couple weeks ago, it was announced that the release date was pushed back by a week, to July 31, 2026. Filming is expected to take place later this year.

CBS canceled FBI: International and FBI: Most Wanted last week, and fans are now wondering if NBC could swoop in and save the two TV shows from cancellation.

It's not the norm for other networks to save canceled content from their competitors. It has happened though. 9-1-1 moved from Fox to ABC, and ABC also picked up American Idol when it was axed.

The reason fans think this could happen is because the FBI dramas are from Dick Wolf, who has ties to both CBS (with the FBI franchise), as well as NBC (with the One Chicago shows and Law & Order shows).

However, there's another side to this that makes it seem unlikely.

Keep reading to find out more...

One reason fans think NBC would not be able to save those two shows is the network already has a full schedule. They have Chicago Wednesdays with Chicago Fire, Chicago Med, and Chicago PD, they have Law & Order Thursdays, dramas like Found, Brilliant Minds, Suits LA, and The Irrational, and comedies Lopez vs. Lopez, and Night Court. Then they also have reality competition shows The Voice and Deal or No Deal Island. 

On top of that, NBC has already issued renewals to several TV shows for 2025-2026 primetime slots.

While this isn't definitive, some fans don't believe the switch from CBS to NBC could happen due to tight scheduling. As NBC decides what their future schedule looks like, it's a lot of moving pieces to consider. Ultimately, we'll have to wait and see what happens.

The trailer for the live action version of Lilo & Stitch is finally here!

The film is a reimagining of Disney's 2002 animated classic!

Chris Sanders - the voice actor, filmmaker, and animator who originally created Stitch and co-wrote and co-directed the original movie with Dean DeBlois - is voicing Stitch again in the new movie.

Newcomer Maia Kealoha will be playing Lilo, the little girl from Hawaii who adopts Stitch.

According to an official film synopsis, Lilo & Stitch ""tells a story of the bond formed between a lonely human girl named Lilo and a dog-like alien named Stitch, who was genetically engineered to be a force of destruction. With nosy social workers and pursuing aliens banging on the door, the two bond over a shared sense of family and win the day.""

Sydney Agudong will be playing Lilo's older sister Nani while Kahiau Machado is playing David Kawena, Nani's love interest. The cast also includes Zach Galifianakis, Billy Magnussen, Courtney B. Vance, Amy Hill, and Tia Carrere.

The live-action Lilo & Stitch movie hits theaters on theaters May 23, 2025.

Temptation Island is back!

The reality TV show arrived with a new twist on Netflix today (Wednesday, March 12), with all 10 one-hour episodes dropping at the same time. 

You can watch it now on Netflix.

The series originally premiered on Fox back in 2001 through 2003. In 2019, USA Network revived the show for a season. And now, in 2025, Netflix is airing the latest season of the long-running dating series.

Keep reading to find out more…

Here's a synopsis: “In this brand new season of Temptation Island, coming to Netflix, emotions run high when four couples, each at a crossroads in their relationship, head to Temptation Island to put their love to the ultimate test as they agree to live separately with a group of singles of the opposite sex. Will the choices they make push the couples closer together or farther apart into the arms of a new lover?”

In a new twist, there will be a “Temptation Haven,” a tent outside each villa that will have no cameras allowing for people to have true alone time. But whenever someone goes in, a red light is sent to the other villa.

Each week, host Mark L. Wahlberg sits down with the men and women separately, and they will be shown out-of-context clips of what their significant other has been up to on the island. Each couple will decide if they want to stay together, leave alone or leave with a new partner.

“These hills have eyes, and they're all staring at me,” Kyle Richards mutters as the paparazzo she (allegedly) called snaps a photo of her and country ministar Morgan Wade for the umpteenth time, despite her insistence The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills respect her privacy and say nothing.

Beverly Hills is the land of pearl-clutching, where women gasp and guffaw at any perceived slights while hiding their true intentions behind a thin veil of glass. Drama only emerges by accident, slipping through the smallest of cracks, immediately to be suffocated.

That's how we've made it through 15 episodes of the season without Kyle's ever-absurd double standards reaching a head. Despite the many highs (and Kathy Hilton-induced lows) of Season 14, it simply feels like we're getting played for fools once again, all as another annoying attempt to takedown Sutton Stracke manifests—one that cements Sutton as the star of new-age RHOBH.

In the aftermath of Sutton's “sustainable” fashion show, the ladies are split once again: Erika, Dorit, and Boz irritated as ever with Sutton (and by proxy, Garcelle), while Garcelle and Sutton begin planting seeds against Kyle, and Kyle… well, she's just moping around.

First, Erika invites the girls over to see her renovated home, which still looks the way it did last week. Too bad. As they ignore Levain cookies and some cawfee cake, the ladies go in on their growing disdain for Sutton, Erika still irked at her Season 11 and 12 hazing. And sure, I get it, she got it decently bad by RHOBH standards. But get over it! Seriously. Get over it. That was years ago, and it was the first—and only—time Erika was ever interesting on screen.

As Erika and Dorit continue wondering why Sutton would be mad at insinuations she has a drinking problem (even if she very well does!), it's like… well Erika you're still mad about what was said about you two business years ago. I enjoy hypocrisy on my screen, but only when it's funny. Erika's boring.

As for Dorit, keep poking and prodding shamelessly at Sutton without introspecting at all, girlie. Next week's boat meltdown looks so fun.

Meanwhile, Garcelle tries to snipe from the side by pushing Sutton to address the Morgan Wade elephant in the room, while Sutton tiptoes around the truth in fear of those hills and their eyes. It's great we're finally acknowledging Kyle's hypocrisy (even if it needs to be to her face for real results), but it's almost too Beverly Hills how they go about it.

Sutton is a scaredy cat who avoids intentional confrontation. She may always be in drama, but that's simply because she has foot-in-mouth syndrome and speaks faster than she thinks. Garcelle, on the other hand, has picked up the Lisa Vanderpump role of pushing her beta to do her dirty work for her while she waits to dig in the confessional.

So it's a funny scene watching Garcelle push Sutton while Sutton argues even asking Kyle “how was the concert?” is a straw too far, but it's also indicative of the problem.

It's hard to even be annoyed with Kyle when her ground game runs circles around her peers. People wonder how she gets reelected as Speaker of the House year after year, but she's simply a masterful social strategist. She'll always have the numbers on her side, which is way more important than having the truth.

This week, Kyle gains an important ally in Boz, inviting her over for a tear-filled performance. She cries over the photos of Mauricio and that random woman, wondering if her marriage is truly over. Boz, ever the marketer, sticks to the business memo, coddling Kyle while ignoring the elephant in the room.

Maybe it's the journalist in me, but I'd just ask: How is this different than you and Morgan? The abundance of Daily Mail photo-ops seems like an open invitation to simply ask some questions. That's all.

That's the thing about Boz. She's not exactly a fan of digging deep, her solo scenes constantly seeming like business meetings. Tonight, she invites her boyfriend Keely over to have a formal dinner with her daughter, and it just… feels corporate.

For one, it's confusing how this is their first true one-on-one time, when she's discussing marriage and babies with this man. But it's also confusing how Lael asks such trivial questions like “Would you two live together before marriage?” and “How many babies do you want?” and Boz acts like they're not softballs. I get that Lael doesn't know those answers, but Boz certainly should. She's either not great at relationships, or it's all for a storyline. Time will tell.

Last but not least, we get some final footage from our divorcées before the ladies embark on their trip to St. Lucia. First, Dorit meets with PK, showing face for the first time since very early in the season, for a mostly civil conversation about their impending divorce.

It's still so absurd that Dorit doesn't want this divorce and PK does. It's so humiliating and degrading to even admit that. But it is interesting to note that, as of today, neither one has formally filed for divorce, despite separating last May. That big conversation at Kathy's about PK wanting to rush to file seems to have amounted to nothing, as the two return to their status quo of eating Caesar salads and doing accent work.

Over on the Kyle front, she and Mau finally hash things out now that he's home from Europe. Every Mauricio moment is so perplexing these days. He's just a shell of a man, stirring his coffee as loudly as humanly possible while he and Kyle act on screen like they've never met, yet alone shared a decades-long marriage.

“The photos really did say to me: ‘He's moving on.' You can live in this, you know, lala land for as long as you want, but that was, you know, a hammer on the head, saying, ‘Hello, Kyle! He's moved on.' It's okay. You're both entitled to live your lives,” Kyle shares in a confessional, seeming as close as she's come to admitting the honest truth. “Seeing these photos, I think it makes it pretty clear that this is permanent, and I don't think it's going to be easy coming back from that.”

Maybe it's not that Mauricio has moved on. Maybe it's that Kyle moved on well before he did, and him moving on means she has to commit to that decision. Kyle can't return to the safety of her doldrum marriage, one she no doubt would've been happy to stroll around lovelessly in 99 percent of the time.

Image is everything in Beverly Hills, and no one carries that weight quite like Kyle. Being a late-in-life lesbian with a girlfriend half her age is too unconventional, and far too unpredictable, an image for someone like her, even if it's her reality. Your image has nothing to do with who you are. It's what you project.

To that extent, it's why Sutton's old-money wealth and lavish lifestyle won't ever mask her clumsy, friendship-seeking awkwardness. She doesn't project an image of aspiration, and she'll always be the runt of the group.

That's also why she's consistently the shining star of RHOBH. She constantly shows herself in an unsavory light, keeping the engine moving even when people like Erika want to move it to a halt. It may be embarrassing for her to tearfully admit she just wants the ladies to like her, but it's authentic. That desire to actually integrate into the group keeps Sutton's character dynamic, as opposed to Housewives who treat their fan favorite status like an untouchable shield.

So, yes it's annoying that Kyle's hypocrisy is being swept under the rug for an end-of-season shift against Sutton, but we've learned by now that the more pressure, the brighter the diamond.","{'href': 'https://news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News'}"

Nicolas Cage's ex, the mother of their 34-year-old son, has dismissed her claims against the ""National Treasure"" actor related to a lawsuit accusing their son of assault, according to court documents.

Christina Fulton, who dated Cage from 1988 until 1991, sued both their son, Weston Coppola Cage, and the 61-year-old actor last month, alleging Cage ignored their son's mental health issues and that he ""enabled"" his behavior.

""Weston has a long history of mental and psychological disorder and a history of committing violent assault and battery and harming numerous individuals,"" the lawsuit stated. ""Nicolas has been aware of Weston's history and nevertheless failed to take action to prevent Weston from committing acts of violence and harming others.""

The dismissal was granted on Tuesday with prejudice, according to Entertainment Weekly.

""The allegations by Christina Fulton against Nicolas Cage are absurd and frivolous,"" Cage's lawyers told Fox News Digital in February. ""Weston Coppola is a 34-year-old man.""

""Mr. Cage does not control Weston's behavior in any manner and is not responsible for Weston's alleged assault of his mother,"" the statement continued.

Meanwhile, an attorney for Weston argued, ""the incident with his mother was caused by her – not his father.""

""Weston's father, Nicolas Cage, had absolutely nothing to do with Weston's emotional state or condition leading up to the incident with his mother, Christina Fulton,"" a rep for Weston told Fox News Digital. ""At Christina's urging and direction, he agreed to see a new doctor selected by her, who promptly changed his medication and treatment.""

Weston's attorney added, ""Unfortunately, that resulted in the emotional/medical breakdown resulting in the incident with his mother. Christina's efforts to now blame his father for that incident are absolutely wrong and nothing more than an attempt to generate media attention and force him to pay her money.""

Weston and Fulton allegedly got into an argument that turned physical at her Los Angeles home in April 2024, and he was arrested in July on a felony charge of assault with a deadly weapon after he turned himself in on a warrant.

Fox News Digital confirmed from a Los Angeles Police Department spokesperson that Weston walked into the 77th precinct during the early hours of July 10. He was released on bond at the time.

On July 11, Fulton claimed she was ""brutally assaulted"" by Weston and said that ""it is imperative"" that her son ""receives the help he desperately needs.""

Fulton claimed that Cage had enabled their son by bailing him out of jail several times and drinking with him.

The request to dismiss the claims against Cage, which was filed on March 7, says it relates only to Cage ""and as to no other defendant,"" the Los Angeles Times reported.

Fox News Digital has reached out to reps for Cage and Fulton for comment.

Kate Hudson nearly had a mega wardrobe malfunction.

While promoting her new Netflix show, ""Running Point,"" at the Paley Center for Media recently, the actress — accompanied by her costars onstage — was mid-sentence when a section of her black dress seemed to suddenly shift.

""Oh,"" Hudson responded while quickly grabbing her chest.

Costar Justin Theroux swiftly tended to her and attempted to adjust a clasp in the back of her dress.

Meghan Markle is determined to sprinkle some ""Markle Sparkle"" over fans, but several royal experts claim that the dark cloud of bullying allegations continues to loom over her.

Several crew members from the Duchess of Sussex's Netflix series, ""With Love, Meghan,"" came forward to People magazine. They gushed over working with the ""friendly"" and ""approachable"" royal, who created a ""chill"" environment and gifted pans with a ""personally monogrammed spoon with her handwriting that says, ‘Thank You, Crew.'""

The report was published after the eight-episode series was mercilessly torn apart by royal watchers and less-than-impressed viewers on social media for appearing inauthentic. The show was also hit with poor reviews both in the U.S. and U.K.

Meghan Markle Is No Match For Martha Stewart Or Rachael Ray: Experts

British broadcaster and photographer Helena Chard questioned the People magazine feature, noting that for years the mother of two had been accused of bullying. She pointed out that as recently as September 2024, an unnamed source described the 43-year-old to The Hollywood Reporter as a ""dictator in high heels"" who has ""reduced grown men to tears.""

Fox News Digital reached out to a spokesperson for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex for comment when The Hollywood Reporter's story was published.

Read On The Fox News App

""Meghan is desperate to receive accolades and public approval,"" Chard claimed. ""She longs to be perceived as the best thing since sliced bread. Her aim, with the help of certain publications, is to revamp her character and change the public's perception. Let's face it, she, along with Netflix, needs bums on seats and future bustling sales.""

""The public has a long memory of Meghan's behavior, the hurt and upset caused to the royal family,"" said Chard. ""Meghan hasn't redeemed herself… If anything, she has shown a passive-aggressive side to the public as she clings to her royal title.""

Meghan, a former American actress, married Britain's Prince Harry in 2018. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex stepped back as senior royals in 2020 and moved to California. They cited the unbearable intrusions and racist attitudes of the British media for their royal exit.

But in 2021, days before Meghan and Harry's televised interview with Oprah Winfrey aired, Valentine Low broke the story of bullying allegations. The claims were made by former palace aides who worked with the Duchess of Sussex at Kensington Palace before her royal exit. Meghan's team strongly refuted the claims.

Low later told Fox News Digital that some former staff still had difficulty discussing their experiences. Some even referred to themselves as members of the ""The Sussex Survivors' Club.""

In June 2023, Buckingham Palace announced it had investigated how the staff had handled allegations of bullying made against Meghan.

According to palace officials, the details of the independent review were not being released to protect the confidentiality of those who took part. Following the review, officials said the palace's human resources policy had been updated, but the palace declined to say what the changes were.

Following The Hollywood Reporter's story, several former and current staff members came forward to Us Weekly. They defended the couple and their work ethic.

In February 2025, Vanity Fair published a cover story about the couple's lives in California. Several of those who worked with Meghan described how, at first, she would be ""warm and effusive,"" creating an atmosphere of ""professional camaraderie."" However, whenever something went poorly, ""often due to Meghan and Harry's own demands,"" she would become ""cold and withholding towards the person she perceived to be responsible.""

Then in March, shortly before the premiere of ""With Love, Meghan,"" Jason Knauf, the former palace aide who accused Meghan of bullying, gave a rare interview with ""60 Minutes Australia."" When asked if it was tough to find himself in the spotlight after the allegations of bullying went public, Knauf said he had ""no regrets"" and ""wouldn't change anything.""

""The exclusive [People magazine] article highlighting Meghan Markle's impeccable behavior towards the crew is opportunely placed,"" Chard claimed.

""You'd almost think Meghan had written the article herself! [But] I completely believe Meghan forged above and beyond to cater to the crew, needing to quash previous bullying allegations. [I believe] she was intent on using every trick in the book to ensure her sweetly inauthentic domestic goddess charms look second nature.""

""I would like to believe her actions come from a heart-centered place, similar to her late mother-in-law,"" Chard shared. ""[But] Meghan's sugar-coated [version of herself] just doesn't wash… Authenticity is her biggest challenge.""

Royal expert Hilary Fordwich said she needs more convincing to believe that Meghan's sweet-as-jam persona is the real deal.

""One would hope she listened to and cared about how horrifically bad all her previous staff have felt,"" said Fordwich. ""Perhaps she is bending over backwards to make amends for all those past grievances of her numerous staff members who have quit and reported exactly the opposite. Numbers, unfortunately for Meghan Markle, don't lie. There are too many members of the ‘Sussex Survivors' Club.'""

""… One can guess who contacted People,"" Fordwich added.

Kinsey Schofield, host of the To Di For Daily podcast, pointed out to Fox News Digital that ""With Love, Meghan"" was originally given the green light for two seasons, regardless of its success.

""Sources have said that Meghan's ‘Season 2' announcement on social media was an effort by Meghan and Netflix to distract from the flood of negative feedback, but Netflix executives are ‘worried' about the reception,"" Schofield claimed.

""It's no coincidence that these glowing… stories are appearing in People magazine, which Meghan just gave an exclusive… [But] Meghan only engaging with media entities that refuse to challenge her is not sustainable. If she wants to change public perception, she needs to answer some tough questions.""

""She can feed People magazine all the glowing testimonials she wants, but if only one outlet that has a relationship with you is reporting you're a saint… you both lose all credibility,"" she added.

Schofield noted the Season 2 announcement also ""gives the appearance of a professional win – which she so desperately needed.""

Fox News Digital reached out to Netflix for comment.

Products from Meghan's lifestyle brand, As Ever, are expected to be available for purchase this season. New episodes of ""With Love, Meghan"" will become available for streaming in the fall.

But despite Meghan's attempts to carve out a new role in Hollywood, that of influencer, royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams said she has a long way to go before past bullying allegations fade away for good.

""The reviews of ‘With Love, Meghan' were truly, madly, deeply awful,"" said Fitzwilliams. ""However, it did climb to the Netflix Top 10, which will please her… [But] sycophantic guests watching Meghan cooking in a neighbor's house in the Montecito sunshine won't erase [bullying allegations]. No one has forgotten how [the Duke and Duchess of Sussex] ruthlessly monetized their royal connections and the depth of the rift in the royal family.""

""The revival of allegations of bad behavior, which Meghan strongly denies… has already harmed her image enormously,"" Fitzwilliams shared. ""Who knows what's to come?""

Cancer researchers now believe that targeting the critical energy infrastructure of cancer cells — the mitochondria — may provide a powerful new treatment strategy that overcomes two of the main ways tumors evade destruction.

To kill tumors, doctors use drugs to kill the rogue cells. However, due to the rapid growth of cancer cells and their ability to repair damaged DNA, tumors can quickly develop resistance to these drugs, sometimes spreading throughout the body through a process called metastasis. 

Researchers in China believe that by targeting the mitochondria of cancer cells, both these scenarios could be circumvented.



Mitochondria are specialized structures inside cells that produce the chemical energy required to keep the cell alive and functioning. According to Yanjuan Gu at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, recent studies looking into mitochondria have revealed its potential as a cancer therapy target.

 “Studies revealed that mitochondria lack robust DNA repair mechanisms, making them vulnerable to targeted therapies,” said Gu.

Mitochondria are contained within a specialized double membrane within the cell. In these compartments are the machinery that carries out the energy production as well as a specialized unit of DNA known as mitochondrial DNA. 

One effective treatment against cancer cells is to administer drugs which damage DNA, leading to cell death. But tumors often develop resistance to this because of their DNA repair capability. How veer, the lack of these repair tools in mitochondria prevents this.

Researchers at several institutions found that mitochondria are essential for metastasis — the ability of tumors to spread to other parts of the body. The many mechanisms are still not entirely understood, but changes in tumor cell mitochondria are thought to activate metastasis pathways, where these cancer cell mitochondria can even be transferred to healthy immune cells. This transfer simultaneously suppresses the immune response to the cancer's spread while also facilitating the spread itself.

Based on these findings, Gu and her colleagues hypothesized that by targeting cancer cell mitochondria, they can avoid resistance and prevent or slow metastasis. The challenge, however, is packaging and delivering drugs to the mitochondria.

Any drug targeting tumor mitochondria must enter the cancer cell and then accumulate in the mitochondria — and nowhere else. To do this, drugs are packaged into carriers called exosomes and specific targeting proteins called ligands are attached. Exosomes are membrane-bound structures used by cells to transport various molecules. Ligands line the surface of the exosome and recognize and bind to the membranes of the cancer cells allowing them to get inside.

Unfortunately, finding the right combination of exosome, ligand, and medicine can be difficult because each component can chemically alter the functioning of the other once they are combined into a single structure.



To address these challenges Gu and her team developed a nanoparticle platform consisting of several components, each with a specific job.

Known as OXA@Exo-RD, it is made up of an exosome, a cancer cell-targeting peptide, a mitochondrion-targeting molecule called dequalinium, and the chemotherapy drug oxaliplatin. The chosen exosome is known to be stable when injected into the bloodstream and is not toxic to healthy tissue.

“[The targeting peptide] is one of the most well-known active targeting ligands evaluated preclinically and clinically and holds promise for targeting cancer cells,” explained Gu. The next two target the mitochondria specifically.

Importantly, dequalinium is positively charged, which serves two functions. In cancer cells the difference in charge on either side of the mitochondrial membrane — known as the transmembrane potential — is much higher than normal cells meaning positively charged particles cross easily and accumulate inside.

Dequalinium, therefore, accumulates in the mitochondria, bringing the anticancer drug with it. It is itself also toxic to the mitochondria, and leads to mitochondria failure and cell death. Finally, the drug oxaliplatin binds to the mitochondrial DNA, causing defects and damage. 

Together these components add up to a potent attack on the mitochondria of cancer cells.

To test the nanoparticle treatment, mice with colorectal cancer were treated with OXA@Exo-RD. The team then measured how well the drug entered tumor mitochondria, as well as the reductions in tumor volume and spread from the colon and rectum to the liver.

The results showed that the drug efficiently accumulated in the tumor mitochondria and worked well to reduce tumor size. Compared to control groups, the tumors in mice treated with OXA@Exo-RD were significantly smaller, and when removed and examined, showed the largest amounts of dead cells and necrotic tumor tissue.

Experiments looking at reduced spread of the cancer to the liver found that, compared to control groups receiving saline solution or oxaliplatin on it's own, treatment with the full OXA@Exo-RD nanoparticle reduce the rate of new tumors in the liver up to 86%.



For Gu and the team, these results show that their combination of components making up the nanoparticle are correct. The package was efficiently delivered to the cancer cell mitochondria and worked as expected. But before this treatment becomes commonplace several hurdles remain.

The team needs to evaluate potential side effects to healthy mitochondria and better understand how different tumors will react to the treatment. “Tumor cells exhibit varying mitochondrial membrane potentials,” said Gu, meaning the drug may be less efficient in some cancers. There are also issues with cost, scalability, and regulation.

According to Gu, there are few standardized frameworks for evaluating exosome-based nanodrugs, particularly in terms of immunogenicity and long-term toxicity.

“Regarding cost considerations, the engineered OXA@Exo-RD, as an exosome-based therapy, likely incurs higher upfront costs than conventional chemotherapy due to the complexity of exosome production,” she said. This complexity also reduces the scalability of producing, storing, and transporting the nanoparticles to cancer clinics.

Despite these challenges, “we believe that OXA@Exo-RD represents a promising yet resource-intensive approach for treating chemoresistant cancers,” said Gu. “While current methods, such as conventional chemotherapy, are more accessible, advancements in exosome engineering and manufacturing could help bridge the gap in cost and scalability.”

Even during one of Earth's largest mass extinction events, where heat waves kill of a majority of Earth's species, at least one oasis of survival existed.

The findings suggest that there may have been pockets of protection throughout Earth — challenging the notion that the heat affected life on the planet uniformly, according to a paper in Science Advances.

About 250 million years ago, a series of massive volcanic eruptions warmed Earth. This period, sometimes referred to as “The Great Dying”, was aptly named. It killed off about 95 percent of marine species and 75 percent of land-locked lifeforms, although some species appeared clever enough to find ways to beat the heat. 

The researchers found an abundance of plant fossils dating back to that time in China's Turpan-Hami Basin. The implication? Even though the region was relatively close to some volcanic activity, it somehow shielded a wide variety of plants.

""This suggests that local climate and geographic factors can create surprising pockets of resilience, offering hope for conservation efforts in the face of global environmental change,"" Liu Feng, a paleontology researcher with the Chinese Academy of Science and an author of the paper, said in a press release. 

The fossils the team found pointed to a widely diverse plant community that survived the initial destructive events. Those fossils indicate both resilience that allowed them to bounce back from the volcanic events, as well as the evolutionary ability they needed to adapt afterward.

The team's findings suggest that some land areas were shielded from the worst effects of extinction, creating pockets of resilience that played a crucial role in the rebound of life on Earth. The researchers cited the region's stable, semi-humid climate as essential to the area's ability to continuously support life. The scientists analyzed layers of soil in the area and determined that it received fairly consistent rainfall during the mass extinction period.

The findings challenge one prevailing theory about the Permian mass extinction event. That theory claims that volcanic eruptions in Siberia triggered wildfires, acid rain, and toxic gases, which indiscriminately killed off much of the life on Earth. The opposing view argues that these events differed around the globe, due to differences in atmosphere, latitude, and perhaps geography.

The new findings tilt the scale toward the “variable effects” side. Evidence includes fossil records of fern fields and coniferous forests that existed 160,000 years before the extinction and persisted 160,000 years after it was over. The fossils include intact tree trunks and fern stems, which lend credence to the notion that this was local vegetation, not transported by wind or other elements.

The scientists did detect SOME extinction in the area during that time period, but at 21 percent it was far lower than at much of the rest of the planet. Because the plant oasis persisted, it presented a welcome place for animals to thrive after the event ended. The team found some animal fossils dating to about 75,000 years after the extinction.

The discovery of this “life oasis” shows incredible resiliency and suggests that, with the right conditions, plants and animals can persist following major disasters.

 WTA/Jimmie48
                        


WTA Staff


The BNP Paribas Open quarterfinals are set for the bottom half of the draw, which are scheduled to be played on Wednesday. 

Two-time champion Iga Swiatek's quest for a historic third Indian Wells title remains in play. But to move one step closer, Swiatek must avenge her heartbreaking Olympic loss to World No. 9 Zheng Qinwen. 

Indian Wells: Draws | Scores | Order of play

The other quarterfinal sees 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva take on former No. 3 Elina Svitolina for the first time. Can the teen phenom take her WTA 1000 win streak to double digits? 

Here's how Wednesday's matchups stack up:

Head-to-head: Swiatek leads 6-1

It's been 23 years since a woman lost just six games on her way to the Indian Wells quarterfinal. With a string of gaudy 6-2, 6-0, 6-0, 6-2, 6-1, 6-1 set scores, Swiatek has matched Monica Seles' feat of just six games lost in 2002. 

It's been one of those weeks for Swiatek, who has dismantled Caroline Garcia, Dayana Yastremska, and most impressively, Karolina Muchova. The defending champion has shown once again that desert conditions tend to suit her well -- let's not forget she's a three-time champion in Doha. And for all the talk of the courts possibly playing faster this year, Swiatek's quick performances have quieted those whispers quickly.

Next up is a resurgent Zheng. She came into Indian Wells without back-to-back wins this year but has found her game and her joy to make her first quarterfinal of the year. Zheng has not lost a set, beating Victoria Azarenka, Lulu Sun, and 18th seed Marta Kostyuk. 

Zheng's improved play coincides with her reunion with coach Pere Riba, who underwent hip surgery in November and could not join Zheng as he rehabilitated. Zheng began the year with a pair of interim coaches and Riba was able to return just in time for the Sunshine Double. 

Riba was at the helm when Zheng notched the biggest win of her career at the Paris Olympics last summer, where the 22-year-old toppled Swiatek on Court Philippe Chatrier in the semifinals en route to the gold medal. The 6-2, 7-5 win was Zheng's first over the Pole, and it snapped Swiatek's 26-match win streak on the hallowed grounds of Roland Garros.

Swiatek still owns the lopsided head-to-head, but their matches have been close. Three of Swiatek's wins needed three sets.

Head-to-head: First meeting

Three weeks ago, Andreeva stormed through the field at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships to become the youngest WTA 1000 champion in the format's 16-year history. Now she's taken that win streak to nine matches, and the prospect of her snagging a second WTA 1000 trophy doesn't feel too far off. 

Andreeva has been outstanding in Indian Wells. She has not lost a set, and she has been dominant. She lost just three games to Clara Tauson in a rematch of the Dubai final and then roared past 2023 champion Elena Rybakina to win 6-1, 6-2 in the Round of 16. She has played not like a young player burdened by expectations, but one who has extracted confidence from them. She's worked with her sports psychologist to turn the chatter into motivation.

""It's easier for me to think these people are saying this because they want to put pressure on me, and they put pressure on me because probably they are afraid of the way I play.

""So it's easier for me to think that. It helps me to go on the court with kind of anger, not to prove everyone that I really can do it, but to prove myself that I'm strong enough to handle the pressure and to really win these high-quality matches.""

As she looks to win her 10th straight match, Andreeva will have a new challenge to solve. She has never played Svitolina, who is coming off a resilient three-set win over No. 4 Jessica Pegula. That win, which boosted Svitolina into her first WTA 1000 quarterfinal since 2021, ended the American's seven-match win streak. Can Svitolina spoil another? 

""I know that she's a fighter,"" Andreeva said, ""she runs for every ball. Now she's also playing a little bit more aggressive.

""But all the small details, it's Conchita's job to prepare me.""","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}"

Iga Swiatek continued her sensational winning form at Indian Wells by crushing Karolina Muchova 6-1 6-1 to reach the quarter-finals of the BNP Paribas Open.

Swiatek brushed aside the Czech 15th seed in just 57 minutes and has marched into the last eight for the loss of only six games in total over three matches.

Second seed Swiatek has now won her last 16 matches in the California desert in straight sets with her semi-final defeat to Elena Rybakina two years ago her only blemish since 2021.

🎾18 sets won, 0 sets lost
🎾 27 games dropped in total
🎾 5 sets with 6-0 score
🎾 4 sets with 6-1 score
🎾 AVERAGE set score is 6-1


On Thursday Swiatek will face Qinwen Zheng, who beat Marta Kostyuk 6-3 6-2.

Annabel Croft speaking on Sky Sports Tennis:

""It wasn't much of a contest right from the word go when she was broken in that opening game. She hadn't got enough first serves in and it kind of went from bad to worse where she struggled to get on the scoreboard,"" said the former British No 1.

""She did well to get the two games she did to be honest with you. I just think these conditions did not suit Muchova at all. She couldn't keep the ball going or stay with Swiatek in those slow baseline exchanges.

""Swiatek looks so comfortable. She's not rushed, she's balanced on all the groundstrokes, she creates the angles and she is rock solid at the back.""

Mirra Andreeva eliminated Elena Rybakina, the 2022 Wimbledon champion, at Indian Wells.

The 17-year old took a dominant 6-1 6-2 victory to progress to the quarter-finals.

""Today was a great match,"" Andreeva said. ""I knew that it's going to be tough, but I just tried to go on court and do my best, so I'm just super happy with my win today and can't wait to play my next round here.""

Andreeva will face Elina Svitolina in the last eight after the Ukrainian beat fourth seed Jessica Pegula, a US Open finalist.

Svitolina won in three sets, 5-7 6-1 6-2.

""I got a little bit angry [after losing the first set], a little bit fired up in that second set and tried to play better tennis,"" Svitolina said.

""I'm really happy with the way I was able to stay composed, even after the rain delay.""

Holger Rune overcame Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-4 6-4 in the fourth round to snap the Greek's seven-match winning streak.

The Dane struck 22 winners and hit one of the shots of the season to crucially save a break point in the second set.

He scampered to the baseline and instinctively hit a tweener lob that landed on the baseline.

""I think it was an extremely good match from my side from start to finish,"" Rune said. ""I stayed very committed on my game plan and mentally I was very good. I think that made the difference, how composed I could start. Because Stef is back in shape I think it is fair to say. It was a cool battle.""

""The tweener is the first thing I am going to check when I check my phone. That was better than I expected,"" Rune added.

Coco Gauff is the only player on the WTA Tour with her own signature tennis shoe. Gauff and New Balance have released two signature models, both of which were smash hits among tennis players and fans.

Today, New Balance and Gauff have proudly unveiled the Coco Delray, a tennis shoe designed for the everyday player and built for all levels of competition. 

New Balance aims to expand its tennis offering, emphasizing community and access to play. The Coco Delray launches with a new campaign celebrating tennis as more than just a sport – showcasing connection, community, and the love of the game. 

The campaign video features Gauff and her grandmother, Yvonne Lee Odom. It tells the story of the tennis star's roots growing up in Delray Beach, playing on the public courts at Pompey Park, and the community support of family and friends who uplifted her. 

Gauff's training at Pompey Park taught her more than just skill; she learned that communities build athletes and sports can move culture. 

""I'm incredibly proud to launch the new Coco Delray because it's more than just a tennis shoe – it represents an opportunity to broaden access to those interested in playing the game and will have a positive cultural impact for generations to come,"" said Gauff. 

The World No. 3 continued, ""Delray Beach helped spark my tennis journey, so it's special to me to tell the story of this community that influenced exactly why I love this sport."" 

The Coco Delray is available globally on newbalance.com and at select retailers with a suggested retail price of $110. For more information, visit newbalance.com/tennis. 

The new model arrives in the middle of the Sunshine Double, just before the start of the Miami Open. Currently, Gauff is competing at Indian Wells.

Throughout 2025, the Coco Delray will launch new colorways in tandem with her signature model. The coordinating styles mean that now every player can match Coco on the court, no matter where they are in their tennis journey. 

Offered in both men's and women's sizes, the Coco Delray is engineered for any match on any surface, from your local park to competitive play.

According to the brand, it blends style, comfort, and performance, featuring a low-top model, a nylon plate for stability, and a lightweight FuelCell midsole for comfort and support. The durable rubber outsole is built to withstand even the longest matches. 

With off-court styling inspired by 90's tennis and basketball aesthetics, much like her signature Coco CG2, the shoe seamlessly mixes style-driven design with on-court performance. 

""Our hope with the Coco Delray is to emphasize access to sport for all. It means a lot to Coco that anyone who wants to play tennis should be able to pick up a racquet and play,"" says Evan Zeder, New Balance Head of Tennis Sports Marketing. 

""The Coco Delray represents her ongoing commitment to promoting this inclusivity within the sport, starting in her own backyard,"" concluded Zeder.

The first part of this story provided an intimate look at the destruction, and heartbreak, caused by this January's Southern California wildfires. Below is the second part, which explores the Altadena tennis community, and how the world looks now for Altadena and Pacific Palisades.The Anti-Club: Altadena's Diverse MixTennis' role in Altadena has long had its own distinct flavor. According to Craig Sloane, Altadena Town & Country Club manager, his club was probably its second-oldest running business. Beyond the tennis, it was also a significant communal gathering spot. For more than 50 years, the Altadena Rotary Club had met there every Thursday. Over the years, the club had hosted frequent Chamber of Commerce meetings, weddings, celebrations of life, fundraisers for local schools and much more. All of this makes the tragedy of its destruction incredibly widespread and painful.“We call it kind of the anti-club,” said Fred Guerra, the facility's tennis director. “It's obviously a club, but in the sense that it has a very kind of neighborhood quality to it. There's no air of pretentiousness from club members.”

Back in the 1920s, at a time when many California cities had laws that restricted who could buy property, Altadena welcomed Black homeowners.“It's a tight knit community,” said Esther Hendershott, a Pasadena resident who is the USTA Southern California director of community tennis and diversity, equity and inclusion. “Most families that have lived in the Altadena area have lived there for many years, generations of Black and brown families. It's very diverse.”Beyond the club, Altadena residents play tennis at a variety of venues, including Loma Alta Park, Charles S. Farnsworth Park and John Muir High School. For now, though, these courts are filled with debris—ash, dirt, leaves.“People are in shock, walking around numb,” says Hendershott.Selwyn Brereton, an Altadena resident and co-owner of Pasadena-based iTennis, noted that many Altadena-based players have made their way to Pasadena and the courts at Eaton Blanche Park.“They've formed a nice little community and communicating on a regular basis,” he said. “It's brought a lot of us back to together . . . with everybody trying to help each other.”

“I'm crushed to see so much loss,” said Ron Hightower, a former ATP pro who has taught tennis in the Palisades for more than 30 years, including a decade as the head pro at Riviera. “People who have lost their homes and love tennis have lost that ability, at least for now. It breaks my heart.”Said former ATP pro Chuck Adams, “To literally lose your whole hometown in one night, it's just stifling on the soul. I feel a dark spot in my heart over it, and that even bothers me more than losing my house.”“It was just surreal to see the neighborhood and club completely wiped out,” said Guerra. “It's still numbing.”Sloane has estimated that of his club's approximately 640 member units, more than 100 have lost their homes.“It's heartbreaking to talk to the members and hear their stories,” he said.

The USTA Southern California section, Pasadena residents, and others are rallying to help Altadena. Among its many efforts to aid fire victims, the section is donating shoes and equipment. Nearby clubs are figuring out ways to provide court access for displaced members, as well as for local instructors and their students.“Tennis has an opportunity right now to really support everyone affected by the fires,” said Hendershott.Hall of Famer Gigi Fernandez, through her newly established non-profit, Tennis for Hope, has recently announced plans to provide support for the rebuilding of Palisades Tennis Center.

Chris Boyer, a former longstanding USTA Southern California board member, is also creating ways to generate sustained awareness. Throughout March, as his son plays the BNP Paribas Open and the Miami Open, he'll donate $200 to the fire-affected, Altadena-based Badon Tennis Academy every time Tristan serves an ace. The donation will be matched (up to $5,000) by the Altadena-based 24 Hour Fitness center he works out at when back home.“I hope people can try to help out as much as they can,” said Tristan, “and keep Altadena the way it was before this happened and keep the character of it as much as possible, so we can recover from what happened.”

“It's going to take a little while before we can get back,” said Sloane. “I would assume months, and I can't say specifically how many months. We have to get our utilities back. We have to clean up the facilities. We have to make sure it's safe for us to come back, in terms of air quality, and the ability to provide services.”Brereton is also a USTA official, working at many tournaments throughout Southern California.

On Sunday, February 2, just over three weeks after the fire had started, longtime Palisades resident Wally Marks and I resumed tennis as usual, meeting at 7:00 a.m. at Cheviot Hills Recreation Center. Since he always has items shipped to his office, Wally indeed brought the case of Wilson balls. Because his racquet needed to be restrung, he'd left it in his car that awful Tuesday. But Wally was also wearing new tennis clothes.“There's a sense of wanting to be normal again,” he said after our hitting session.On a Friday afternoon just over three weeks after the fire, I went to Westwood Park, watched the Pali team practice, and spoke with coach Bud Kling.“It was easier to resign myself that my house was going to burn down than have all this hope that it wasn't,” he said. “Psychologically, though, people deal with it differently. To me, it's like tennis: sometimes you just get the ball in. I know people don't always agree with this, but I see the silver lining: we get to design our own house the way we want.”

Altadena, Palisades and its neighboring town, Malibu, have a combined population of 75,000. It's estimated that among these three communities, more than 18,000 structures have been destroyed. Eleven players on Kling's teams have lost their homes. All were evacuated. None are currently living in the Palisades. As I watched the players hit serves, drive their forehands and backhands, and run around the courts, Kling told me, “The parents say, ‘this is the highlight of their day.' They're very appreciative that we're providing something that's normal.”In many cases, dread and anxiety are defined by anticipation of what might happen. In this instance, dread and anxiety are defined by what did happen. As residents of Altadena and Pacific Palisades attempt to absorb, assess, heal, rebuild and move forward, some can take comfort in past pictures gathered as they hurried to evacuate. Others were unable to salvage those beloved memory triggers.

In many cases, dread and anxiety are defined by anticipation of what might happen. In this instance, dread and anxiety are defined by what did happen. As residents of Altadena and Pacific Palisades attempt to absorb, assess, heal, rebuild and move forward, some can take comfort in past pictures gathered as they hurried to evacuate. Others were unable to salvage those beloved memory triggers.

Tennis

INDIAN WELLS, Calif. — It's an annual ritual. Players descend on the California desert and almost universally declare it an ideal location for a major tennis tournament. The sun, the dry air, the luxe accommodations, the jagged hills and mountains that loom just beyond the Indian Wells Tennis Garden outside Palm Springs.

Then they take to the purple and green hard courts with the big bounces that usually only happen on red clay. Another collective shout goes up, and it's not so adoring.

“Hey, wait a minute, I thought this was supposed to be a hard court.”

This year, they might have arrived thinking that things were going to be different. Tournament organizers had selected a new company to surface the courts, the same provider that does the U.S. Open and the Miami Open, which follows Indian Wells on the tennis calendar. Finally, this desert enclave was going to play like the faster hard courts that ATP and WTA Tour players have gotten used to in the U.S..

But it's as slow and bouncy as ever.

“Kind of the same court, really slow, bounce a lot,” Carlos Alcaraz said Monday night, after beating the dangerous Denis Shapovalov 6-2, 6-4. “They said that they changed it, but if nobody told me that I would think it is the same.”

Daniil Medvedev, who two years ago famously threatened to “pee as slow as this court is” while declaring himself a hard-court expert, showed up last week and said he thought the court was as slow and gritty as ever. “Very, very slow,” Medvedev, runner-up in 2023 and 2024, said of the courts.

The Russian, who beat Tommy Paul 6-4, 6-0 in the round of 16 Tuesday, said that when he accidentally dropped his racket during practice, the grittiness of the court ripped his grip as it slid across the ground.

In the past, the Indian Wells playing surface was fashioned by Plexipave. This year, Laykold came on board. In both cases, the courts have three layers: Asphalt or concrete on the bottom, a softer acrylic or silicone surface on top of that, and then surface paint that contains varying amounts of sand.

Tommy Haas, the former player who is tournament director at Indian Wells, said organizers listened to the complaints from the players last year and decided it was time at least try to speed up the courts.

“The outside courts seem to be a little bit quicker than Stadium One and Stadium Two,” Haas said in an interview Tuesday. “Stadium One seems to be the slowest. So we're trying to adjust, looking at numbers and trying to figure out how to keep all the courts as even as possible. That's what we want for the players.”

In general, the more sand in the paint, the slower the court and the higher the bounce. The physics involved is to do with trajectory and velocity. On clay — and a court like Indian Wells — an incoming ball of equal speed and the same trajectory will retain less speed and bounce more steeply than the same ball would on a faster hard court, or on grass. Topspin, something every player needs in varying degrees, will have more impact on a court with more friction, kicking the ball higher into the air. The sand in the paint at Indian Wells increases friction, which is why there are more balls spitting upward than skidding low.

Add in the dry desert air, which lets a ball fly faster than more humid conditions, and what every player who comes to Indian Wells has to learn to deal with is the contrast between how fast the ball travels when it's airborne and how dramatically it slows down when it hits the ground.

“It's hard to hit a winner and hit through your serves here,” Coco Gauff said after her 7-6(1), 6-2 win over Maria Sakkari Monday.

“Sometimes you hit a good shot and you think it's a great shot and your opponent is there. I think it's testing the patience out here.”

Some players get hot and bothered about surfaces and changes. Some don't mind much at all. There are two mostly unspoken but very important truths about surface discussion in tennis. One is that a surface plays to its weather conditions and, at Indian Wells, it's possible to run the gamut of desert heat to icy windstorm across the course of a day and night.

The other is that how a tennis court plays is partly beholden to the players playing on it. Someone with a ton of pop on their serve and monstrous groundstrokes who plays at midday in the sun is going to find things fast. Someone who specializes in maneuvering and defense who plays at night in slanting wind is going to find them slow. The beauty of the court is in the eye of the beholder.

Iga Swiatek, who has won here twice and is the defending champion, looks imperious the moment she arrives. She loves slow courts. She loves high bounces. She loves to see her killer forehand fly through the air. Indian Wells allows for all three. So far her title defense has included three matches, two 6-0 bagels and just 42 games in which she is 36-6. She has won 16 of her 21 return games. She likes it out here.

“It gives me a little bit of an advantage,” Swiatek said. “But on the other hand the conditions are tricky still with the really dry air.”

Alcaraz, who is going for a third title in a row in the men's draw, loves it for the same reasons. So does Stefanos Tsitsipas, on an upswing with his new racket and the feeling of swinging freely with it in hand.

“I've played my entire life with bounces like this,” Tsitsipas said after beating Matteo Berrettini. “The bounce is unusual for a hard court.”

It's true that Indian Wells bounces higher than most hard courts and it would be a sad tennis tour if all hard courts played as close to the same as is possible when factoring in weather and geography. That said, what every player craves at every tournament is consistency. They want the ball to behave uniformly across the grounds, even if that's not really possible, either.

Novak Djokovic, probably the best hard-court player to ever pick up a racket and a five-time winner in Indian Wells, was not particularly pleased with the conditions after his opening match loss to Botic van de Zandschulp over the weekend. Djokovic struggled to find his rhythm all afternoon against the Dutchman. Shots that looked like they were headed into his strike zone seemed to handcuff him, jumping around his midriff.

“The difference between the center court and the other courts is immense,” Djokovic said in his news conference. “The ball is bouncing on the center court higher than some of the highest clay courts.”

At 37, he might never play in this so-called tennis paradise again.

Aryna Sabalenka, the women's world No. 1 who will likely have to get through Swiatek in a final to win here, said she even thought there were “some questionable parts of the court where the ball doesn't bounce at all or the ball goes really high up.”

“It's just a very minimal amount of of whining at times, trying to find the balance that they would like at the end of the day,” Haas said of the extent of player complaints.

“But again, if you do well at tournaments, you usually quickly forget if the ball bounces a little higher or a little lower, or how fast it goes through the court. At the end of the day, it's all about winning.”

Multiple factors contribute to how fast or slow the tennis ball moves on any particular court. The ball itself. The air temperature and the humidity. Given its desert location, Indian Wells doesn't produce much humidity, but it gets seriously chilly at night, with temperatures often hovering in the low-50s, and that's when things go slower. But on a hot, dry, and mostly still Monday afternoon, things got interesting for Alex de Minaur in his match against Hubert Hurkacz. The latter's kick serve — which players most often hit to their opponent's backhand, trying to get them to hit it above their shoulders — left him with a bad case of the giggles.

De Minaur won 6-4, 6-0, but said that dealing with Hurkacz's second serve was “laughable at times. I felt like I needed a step ladder.”

“The surface speed feels exactly the same speed as different years,” De Minaur added. “What makes for completely different conditions is the weather.”

No one would have any issues with that. But that also sort of assumes that all the courts play the same, which they don't. Not here, not anywhere, which is the point Djokovic was making. At most tournament sites, the outer courts get far more play than the stadium courts. That smooths them out by comparison and makes them slicker than their show-court counterparts.

Ben Shelton, who plays compatriot Brandon Nakashima in the round of 16, said he arrived in Indian Wells about a week early. He got plenty of practice on the two main stadium courts, and also on the outer courts. He's with Djokovic on this one.

“I think at every hard court tournament the center court is slower, checks up more,” Shelton said Saturday after his win against Mariano Navone of Argentina. “I feel the same with Rod Laver (Arena, in Melbourne, Australia), I feel the same with Ashe (Arthur Ashe Stadium, N.Y.),” he added, referring to the two main courts at the Australian and U.S. Opens.

Shelton put that knowledge and the favorable climate to work on Monday, during a tight contest with Karen Khachanov of Russia.

When things got close in the second set, Shelton started banging 150mph serves right at Khachanov, who could barely get out of the way. When Khachanov focused on avoiding that serve, Shelton started kicking balls out wide.

“I get the most out of those serves here because it is so hard to bring the ball down into the court,” he said, after winning 6-3, 7-5.

There is another approach to all this, the one favored by world No. 11 Tommy Paul. “I'm the worst guy to ask about this stuff,” he said. “I don't even think about it. I just go out there and play.”

He was still alive — until Indian Wells' chief hater, Medvedev, took him to task. Perception is nine-tenths of the law.

Mirra Andreeva scores Elena Rybakina win in rainy Indian WellsByDavid KanePublished Mar 12, 2025 copy_link

Published Mar 12, 2025

Mirra Andreeva thundered to a second victory over Elena Rybakina in three weeks, navigating a rainy Tuesday to win, 6-1, 6-2 and make her first BNP Paribas Open quarterfinal.The ninth-seeded 17-year-old needed three sets to defeat Rybakina en route to the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships title last month but was much more efficient in spite of a lengthy rain delay to defeat the No. 7 seed in 64 minutes on Court 2.Andreeva has played stellar tennis in her first tournament since capturing a maiden WTA 1000 title and ascending into the Top 10, rolling into the fourth round without dropping a set. She allowed just three games to No. 22 seed Clara Tauson in a rematch of their Dubai final to book another rematch with Rybakina.

Andreeva has played stellar tennis in her first tournament since capturing a maiden WTA 1000 title and ascending into the Top 10, rolling into the fourth round without dropping a set. She allowed just three games to No. 22 seed Clara Tauson in a rematch of their Dubai final to book another rematch with Rybakina.

A former Wimbledon champion, Rybakina has played solid tennis through a chaotic start to her season, one that has involved multiple coaching switches and the reported one-year ban handed to former coach Stefano Vukov. Rybakina officially began working with former ATP player Davide Sanguinetti following the Australian Open and posted strong resulted through the Middle East Swing, reaching semifinals in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, plus a quarterfinal in Doha.Like Andreeva, Rybakina also made the fourth round without dropping a set, but quickly fell behind Tuesday evening against her young opposition, who broke in the third game.Andreeva was looking to consolidate her early lead when the stormy conditions that interrupted play throughout the afternoon returned in earnest, and the players were sent off court waiting for action to resume.Once back on court, Andreeva hit the ground running, reeling off four straight games to capture the opening set. Though she threw in an ill-timed double fault to hand Rybakina an opening break in the second, the teenager recovered with aplomb as she turned the tables to earn a 5-2 lead.Andreeva engineered a pair of match points on Rybakina's serve and quickly converted the second to ease over the finish line after barely an hour on court.Waiting for her in the last eight is a first meeting with No. 23 seed Elina Svitolina, a former world No. 3 fresh off a big win over No. 4 seed Jessica Pegula earlier on Tuesday.

                            2025 Indian Wells
                        

Mirra Andreeva ousted Elena Rybakina from a tournament for the second time in three weeks on a rainy Tuesday night at the BNP Paribas Open, advancing to the quarterfinals behind a commanding 6-1, 6-2 performance. 

Indian Wells: Draws | Scores | Order of play

The 17-year-old needed three sets to beat Rybakina on her way to winning the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships last month, but had no such troubles in a dominating 1 hour and 3-minute performance inside Stadium 2 at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden -- against a player who lifted the trophy at the tournament two years ago. Andreeva won six straight games in coasting to the first set -- her momentum only disrupted by a rain delay in the fourth game -- and also won four straight games in the second set, quickly resetting after losing serve at the start.

""I knew that the match was going to be incredibly tough,"" Andreeva said post-match. ""She's won the tournament here, I think she feels very comfortable playing on these courts, so I just found a great mindset for this match and I just tried to fight for every point. 

""I was so excited to play tonight ... with all the courage, I just went on court and tried to show the best level of tennis.""

Andreeva has now won nine straight matches, and is the youngest player through to the Indian Wells quarterfinals since Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova also did it at 17 in 2009. Read on for more facts and figures from Andreeva's latest triumph.

The streak continues ⭐️Mirra Andreeva moves through to the Indian Wells quarterfinals and extends her match winning streak after defeating Rybakina 6-1, 6-2.#TennisParadise pic.twitter.com/VShT161GWC

0: Rybakina did not hit an ace against Andreeva, and was broken six times. The 2022 Wimbledon champion entered the tournament second on the Hologic WTA Tour in total aces this season behind Clara Tauson.

3: All three of the matches between Andreeva and Rybakina have come at WTA 1000 events -- but Tuesday's affair was the first to not go three sets. Rybakina previously won at the 2023 China Open from a set down, but Andreeva has now won back-to-back matches in the head-to-head -- and pushed her season record against Top 10 opponents to 3-2 in the process. 

4: The big-hitting Rybakina struck just four winners against Andreeva, who hit 19 winners.

5: Since the format's introduction in 2009, Andreeva is now the first player to reach five WTA 1000 quarterfinals before the age of 18. She entered Tuesday's match tied with Coco Gauff.

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

7: The victory was Andreeva's seventh against a Top 10 player in her young career. Since 2000, only Maria Sharapova (10) and Kim Clijsters (eight) have claimed more Top 10 victories before turning 18.

9: Andreeva's nine-match winning streak in a career best at Hologic WTA Tour level, though she won 16 straight matches when counting ITF World Tennis Tour results in 2023. All nine of those wins have come at WTA 1000 level, and she is the youngest player to win that many at this tournament level since the format's introduction.

33: Rybakina totaled 33 unforced errors in two sets -- nearly double Andreeva's total of 19. 

Andreeva will look to extend her unbeaten run to double figures when she faces former World No. 3 Elina Svitolina for the first time in the quarterfinals.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}"

Elina Svitolina said she had received an outpouring of support from Americans after the US president Donald Trump's extraordinary clash with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House last month.

Svitolina thanked Americans for their “unwavering support” and “compassion” in a social media post on Sunday after beating Danielle Collins in the third round of Indian Wells. After defeating another local hope Jessica Pegula 5-7, 6-1, 6-2 on Tuesday to move into the quarter-finals, Svitolina told reporters she had received solid support at the tournament in the California desert.

“I feel like since that meeting in the Oval Office, I got a lot of messages of support from the American people and a lot of people here when I arrived at the tournament, giving love and support to Ukrainians for people back at home,” she said. “Also the massive support that I got taking in consideration that I played three American girls back-to-back. It's amazing, really special to get that, taking into consideration all the stress that all Ukrainians are facing right now back at home.”

After the Ukrainian dropped the first set, she rallied before the weather interrupted proceedings early in the third set. “I got a little bit angry [about losing the first set], a little bit fired up in that second set and tried to play better tennis,” Svitolina said. “I'm really happy with the way I was able to stay composed, even after the rain delay.” Pegula entered the day with a seven-match winning streak that included a tournament title in Austin, Texas.

Svitolina next faces the Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva in the quarter-finals. Ukrainian players have been boycotting the post-match tradition of shaking hands at the net when taking on opponents from Russia and Belarus, which is a staging ground for the invasion.

Earlier, Iga Swiatek walloped Karolina Muchova 6-1, 6-1 to book her place in the last eight, continuing her relentless march through the tournament with another lopsided victory.

The Polish former world No 1 has only dropped six games since arriving at the event and brushed aside her Czech opponent with a near-flawless performancethat included just four errors against a dozen winners while never facing a break point.

“Honestly, sometimes matches can be pretty weird,” Swiatek, the Indian Wells champion in 2022 and 2024, said after the 57-minute victory. “It's enough for one player to not feel perfect and the other feel great. Then suddenly the difference is much bigger than it usually is. It's tennis. Things like that can happen. For sure, I used my opportunities and I used my chances. It's not easy, but, well, I can imagine that it looks like it.”

Swiatek is one of 10 women who have two championships in the Southern California event, and she is aiming to be the first to prevail three times. She got her latest victory out of the way before a rainstorm that paused all action. “I knew this big cloud is coming and probably if I'm not going to finish then I'm going to wait a bit,” Swiatek said. “On [the] last two games, it was a bit slippery already, but I really wanted to finish. So I kind of played more risky – but the shots were still in.”

After waiting through a rain delay, Swiatek took immediate hold of the momentum, sprinting through the first four games and not dropping a first-serve point in the opening set. Muchova, who enjoyed an inspired run to the US Open semi-final last year after recovering from wrist surgery, was unable to find her level in the second set as the mistakes piled up.

Swiatek closed it out in 57 minutes with an unreturnable serve to set up a meeting with either Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen of China or Ukrainian Marta Kostyuk who meet later, weather permitting.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=tennis+news","The three current tennis players Rafael Nadal is a big fan of and is backing to carry the sport after his retirement","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/the-three-current-tennis-players-rafael-nadal-is-a-big-fan-of-and-is-backing-to-carry-the-sport-after-his-retirement/","Wed, 12 Mar 2025 03:00:00 GMT","

Rafael Nadal won 22 Major titles as a professional, cementing his legacy as one of the sport's greatest ever players.

The Spanish star dominated the ATP Tour alongside his two greatest rivals, Roger Federer, and Novak Djokovic for decades as they collected tennis' biggest prizes.

Nadal won 22 Grand Slams, including a record-breaking 14 French Open titles, eight more than any other player achieved in the Open Era.

His performances helped tennis develop into the sport it is today, as fans around the world tuned in to see Nadal compete throughout his career.

When Nadal retired from tennis in 2024 many questioned who would help drive the sport forward in his absence.

Speaking after his retirement, the 38-year-old has now named the three players he thinks will help continue to grow the sport.

Appearing as a guest on the Served with Andy Roddick podcast, Nadal was full of praise for his fellow Spaniard, who he thinks will do great things in the sport.

“I think Carlos [Alcaraz] is a great kid, a great guy, with a very good family behind him with positive values,” he said.

“They're humble, good persons, that's why I think Carlos is how he is, because at the end the values you receive at home, the way you are educated is the way you show up.”

Nadal and Alcaraz played doubles together at the 2024 Olympic Games, reaching the quarter-finals of the tournament before falling to defeat against the American pair of Rajeev Ram and Austin Krajicek.

Nadal then named two other players he thinks will help push the sport in the right direction.

“I see the same with Iga [Swiatek], I think Jannik [Sinner] is another good guy, not much of a show-off, focuses on what he is doing,” said Nadal.

“Of course, he went through a very tough process in the last year, and it was amazing the way that he was able to keep focused on what he's doing.

“I think it's a new generation of great tennis players there that are going to keep helping this beautiful sport grow and to engage fans.”

Swiatek has spoken freely about her admiration for Nadal, fulfilling a lifelong dream when she played alongside him in a charity match in 2022.

Nadal said he was impressed by Sinner's ‘focus', having endured a tough time in 2025, recently receiving a three-month suspension from the sport.

The Italian world number one is set to return to action at the Italian Open in May in front of his home fans.

In short, the answer is of course no, as Nadal's rival Djokovic continues to compete on the ATP Tour, having won a record 24 Major titles to date.

After the Serb, however, there are few ‘active' tennis players that can match the career achievements of the trio Nadal spoke so fondly of.

WTA star Swiatek is leading the charge with five, as she looks to chase down Djokovic's record of 24 Slams.

The Pole will head to the French Open in May as the heavy favorite to pick up the title, having dominated at the event over recent years.

Swiatek beat Paolini in the 2024 French Open final to take home her fourth title at Roland Garros and her fifth Major in total.

A sixth title for Swiatek could be on the horizon, as could a fifth for Alcaraz, who won his maiden French Open crown in 2024.

The Spaniard will look to bounce back from a tough Australian Open tournament, where he lost in the quarter-finals to Djokovic.

Only time will tell how the stars of the ATP and WTA Tour perform at the French Open, but it will certainly be worth a watch when tennis heads to Paris on Sunday, May 25.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}"

Already a multi-millionaire thanks to his tennis career, Roger Federer's greatest financial gain actually came away from the court.

The Swiss is third in the all-time career prize money top earners in tennis history, behind only Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, but his recent business ventures have seen make a lot more money than he ever did in his career.

Federer was already a fan of Swiss running shoe company On Running so reached out for a partnership with the brand and when your country's biggest sporting star offers something like that, you say yes.

On Running sold 3% equity in the company to Federer, making him the face of the brand and also designing his own shoe, which had a huge boost to their fortunes.

With Federer's support and fame, the shoe company's value soared to $12 billion and when the company went public in September 2021, shares were sold at $24 meaning Federer's cut was now worth a staggering $360 million almost three times as much as the $130 million he earned in tennis.

On told Tennis365 in April how Federer was involved in creating his own shoe line.

“Roger's contribution towards the success and immense popularity of The ROGER Pro is unquestionable and he continues to be one of On's most admired innovation leaders,” they said.

“Roger's wealth of knowledge and expertise has been instrumental in every aspect of the performance design and technology adapted to meet the demands of the game.

Federer's skill and marketability have made him one of the richest athletes in the world and in 2020, Forbes named him as the world's highest-paid athlete.

The 20-time Grand Slam winner also earned a considerable amount from sponsors such as Rolex, Mercedes-Benz, and Wilson.

In 2018, Japanese apparel maker Uniqlo tempted Federer away from Nike with a 10-year $300 million deal, making it one of the biggest sponsorship deals of any athlete.

Elsewhere, Chilean plant-based food company NotCo received $330 million in investment from a number of the athletes, including Federer as well as F1 driver Lewis Hamilton and golfer Tiger Woods.

Federer is not the only tennis player to dip his toe in investments with Rafael Nadal recently receiving €100 million after selling 44.9% of his tennis academy in Mallorca. The Spaniard also earns money from being a tennis ambassador for Saudi Arabia.

Andy Murray has a number of investments such as Castore, Game4Padel, PerkBox and WeSwap.

The Scot also owns a £2 million hotel near his Dunblane home where he got married.

Last year, Djokovic unveiled a new wellness product, SILA, with Austrian company Waterdrop.

“The idea to create SILA started more than 10 years ago,” Djokovic said.

“I started being more disciplined, passionate and relentless about finding the best ways to improve myself both on and off the court.

“I was so inspired by the overall wellness state I was in and how it was affecting my performance, that I decided to look into creating my own brand that could enrich people's lives the same way it did mine.”

Andy Roddick and Rafael Nadal crossed paths on several occasions, competing at the sport's biggest tournaments.

The American and Spanish stars played one another ten times on the ATP Tour, as one player enjoyed far more success than the other.

Nadal won seven of their ten matches, while Roddick won just three, at the US Open in 2004, the Dubai Tennis Championships in 2008, and the Miami Open in 2010.

Both players won Major titles and reached world number one during their careers, although Nadal's spell at the top lasted longer than Roddick's as he won 21 more Slams and held the number one ranking for 196 more weeks.

Roddick retired from tennis in 2012, 12 years before the Spaniard did so in 2024 following the conclusion of the Davis Cup.

Nadal's longevity in the sport had been praised throughout his career, as Roddick now admits he wasn't too sure the 22-time Major champion would stick around for as long as he did.

Roddick interviewed Nadal on his Served with Andy Roddick podcast recently and admitted that he got something ‘extremely wrong' about the legendary Spanish star.

“You know he has had a lot of injuries,” he said.

“He plays so physical, it's not super surprising.

“I thought he was going to be done by 27 or 28 years old, if I am being honest.

“His longevity is something that I got extremely wrong.”

Nadal won his final Major title at the 2022 French Open as a 35-year-old, making him the sixth oldest Grand Slam champion in Open Era history.

Roddick then spoke about the foot injury that caused Nadal problems during the latter stages of his career, describing it as ‘gross.'

“He took his shoe off, there is a gremlin coming out his foot,” said Roddick.

“I said to him that it looked like his foot was pregnant, it looked like his foot was pregnant.

“He's tough.

“There is something living in there, he thinks it's a tennis injury, it's kind of like a beehive that is about to explode or something, it was gross.”

Nadal also named the year he first injured his foot back at the beginning of his tennis career.

“He said he first hurt that foot at the end of 2005,” said Roddick.

“He said 2005 was a good year, I won 11 times on tour.”

He may have struggled with injury but that didn't stop him from enjoying one of the best years of his career in 2005, as Nadal picked up 11 ATP titles.

Only his rival Roger Federer could match him 20 years ago, also picking up 11 titles, as the Spaniard truly developed into one of the best players in men's tennis.

Nadal won his first Major title at the French Open in 2005, battling back from a set down to beat Mariano Puerta on Court Philippe Chatrier.

He won 11 of his 12 finals in 2005, with his only defeat coming at the hands of his greatest rival, Federer, at the Miami Open.

In a Floridian thriller, Federer secured his first career victory over Nadal having lost to him at the same venue one year earlier.

The Swiss star took home the title after five sets of grueling action, 2-6, 6-7, 7-6, 6-3, 6-1.

Nadal retired from tennis in 2024 having never won more titles in a year than he did in 2005, as he racked up the wins regardless of injury.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}"

Men's Tennis | 3/12/2025 12:00:00 PM

BALTIMORE, Md. (March 11, 2025) — The Morgan State men's tennis team secured a hard-fought 4-3 victory over Harford Community College in a non-conference match held Tuesday afternoon at the familiar Clifton Park Tennis Courts. 

The Bears found themselves in an early hole, losing the doubles point to their opponents. While the competition was fierce across all courts, it was the match on court 1 that ultimately sealed the deal for the visiting Owls. Tristan Duval and Unai Herena Perez narrowly edged out the Bears' duo of Niles Rachal and Makkijah Brown in a hard-fought battle. The pair's 7-6 (9-7) victory gave the Owls a valuable point to kick off the day's competition.

Despite facing a challenging opponent in Tristan Duval, senior standout Mikeal Carpenter,  battled fiercely on court 1, ultimately taking the victory 7-5, 7-5.

Undeterred by the initial setback, the Bears rallied with impressive wins across the remaining courts. Bertin Karenzi, Mohamed Ridsha Ghettas, and Yessine Kerout secured crucial victories on courts 3, 4, and 5, respectively, showcasing the team's depth and resilience.

While the final scores might not have reflected the dominance they sought, the team refused to buckle under pressure, fighting for every point, every inch. ""Just another tough and ugly win,' admitted Carpenter, echoing the sentiment of a team that knew victory didn't always come easy. 'But this is what we work for, and I'm glad to have pulled through for my team.""

The afternoon's contest provided valuable match experience and momentum for Morgan as they look to continue their season strong.

Play has resumed on Tuesday night at the 2025 BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells after the latest burst of rain passed through the desert.

On Stadium 1, Arthur Fils and Marcos Giron returned to court at 8:50 p.m. local time to continue their fourth-round match, which was twice suspended. The players first left the court a 4:05 p.m. local time with the score at 1-1. They returned shortly after 7 p.m. but were again sent to the locker room after an hour of play with Fils leading 6-2, 1-3.

 Earlier on the show court, Holger Rune overcame Stefanos Tsitsipas in straight sets to improve to 4-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. The rain began again shortly after the conclusion of Rune's win at 4:05 p.m., when Fils and Giron were forced off court for the first time.

After rain delayed the start of Day 7 action, Tallon Griekspoor and Yosuke Watanuki stepped onto Stadium 2 for the first ATP Tour singles match of the day. However, play was suspended at 1:27 p.m. local time with the Dutchman Griekspoor leading 7-6(4), 4-1. They resumed again at 2:00 p.m and Griekspoor quickly wrapped up a 7-6(4), 6-1 win to reach the quarter-finals at an ATP Masters 1000 for the first time.

Later on Tuesday, Daniil Medvedev will play Tommy Paul in the day's final fourth-round match.

 March  12, 2025  | Women's Tennis

 By: OU Athletics Communications

NORMAN — University of Oklahoma women's tennis player Gloriana Nahum was named the Southeastern Conference (SEC) Co-Freshman of the Week on Wednesday following her performance in the Sooners' SEC home-opening victories against No. 69 Missouri and No. 16 Vanderbilt over the weekend.

The weekly honor is the first of Nahum's career and the second SEC Freshman of the Week honor for OU this season. 

Ranked No. 98 in singles by the Intercollegiate Tennis Association, Nahum has played a key role in the Sooners' success this season. The freshman from Cotonou, Benin, went 3-0 in singles and doubles combined, helping OU secure its fourth and fifth ranked wins of the season. Her performance included a match-clinching victory on court six against Vanderbilt's Sophia Webster (6-1, 4-6, 6-4). Splitting time between No. 5 and No. 6 singles, Nahum holds an 8-1 dual record, with all but one of her wins coming in straight sets.

In doubles, Nahum went 2-0 over the weekend, teaming with senior Ava Catanzarite at the No. 3 spot to defeat Missouri's Lailaa Bashir and Zoe Lazar (6-1) before topping Vanderbilt's Vijayakumar and Valeria Ray (6-4). She leads the team with a 9-2 record this spring. 

The Sooners will continue SEC play at home against No. 68 Kentucky on Friday. First serve against the Wildcats is set for 5 p.m. CT at the Headington Family Tennis Center. OU tennis-themed Pink mugs will be available to fans for free while supplies last.

DEI Resources

 

Tempe, AZ – Working in collaboration with the ITA Student-Athlete Council, the Intercollegiate Tennis Association (“ITA”) is proud to spotlight another college tennis figure in our monthly heritage month spotlights that aim to highlight the many diverse backgrounds that make up the sport of college tennis.

With March being Women's History Month, the ITA is continuing to spotlight female student-athletes and coaches, allowing them to have a platform to share their stories and experiences. This week's spotlight features Alison Ojeda from the University of Tennessee who has been a trailblazer in our sport when it comes to coaching and inspiring others through her dedication and hard work.

As a player, Ojeda earned over 100 singles and 100 doubles victories for the Lady Vols, just one of four players in program history to accomplish such a feat. During her senior year, Ojeda served as a captain for Tennessee's first-ever NCAA semifinal appearance and would make three appearances in the NCAA Singles Championship and two appearances in the NCAA Doubles Championship during her career.

Making several stops at some of the nation's top programs before returning to her alma mater as the head coach, Ojeda is currently in her ninth year at the helm of the Lady Vols. Coming off of a season in which Tennessee reached the NCAA Semifinals, Ojeda is the reining ITA Women's National Coach of the Year and has been named the Ohio Valley Regional Coach of the Year on four occasions, including last year.

In this spotlight, Ojeda will share a little bit about herself and some of her experiences as a female athlete and coach in the tennis community and how she hopes to make an impact on future generations.

See what Alison had to say in this spotlight below:

How did you start playing tennis? What inspired you to pursue tennis at this level?I started playing tennis at the Jewish community center when I was about eight or nine years old. There was one court that had cracks in it and it also had a backboard on the side fence, so it was often left unused. I'd come from the swimming pool and throw on a pair of shoes and just start hitting against the backboard. If I missed the ball, it would roll onto the next court and the older ladies would get mad at me. So, I learned to keep the ball going on the backboard.

Who were your role models or biggest supporters along the way? How did they influence your tennis career?My role models along the way were definitely my parents. They, along with my sisters and my grandparents, were also my biggest supporters. We came from a family who valued time spent together, so often my tournaments became our family vacations. It was not fair to my sisters, so I've always made sure to thank them for the sacrifices they made as young kids. They could've been mad at me but supported me instead. I also remember a time when I overheard my parents arguing about finances. I told my mom that day in the car that I wanted to quit tennis. She turned around and asked why and I wouldn't tell her. So my sister said that I heard them arguing about money. My mom said that they would figure everything out as long as it was something I still loved to do, which it was. So, I have always been incredibly thankful to them and always want to make sure I make them proud.

Did you face any challenges as a woman pursuing sports at a high level? If so, how did you overcome them?Luckily, I feel like women have had a lot of opportunities in the sport of tennis because of the trailblazers like Billie Jean King and others who came before us. When I was nine, I wanted to play professional soccer, but that profession didn't exist. So that's why I chose tennis. The challenges I have faced have really come as I've grown older. As a female, I feel we are often underpaid compared to our male counterparts. We tend not to fight for an increase in salaries the way men do. Another challenge came when we decided to start a family. Thankfully, I work for an amazing administration that supports us coaches being moms.

What has been the most rewarding part of your coaching experience so far?Definitely the relationships! I'm currently on the road competing with our team and we're playing against a team whose coaching staff consists of one of our alumni. It's so wonderful to be able to sit down and catch up with our former players and see how their career is going and also reminisce on their playing days at Tennessee. It's also amazing to share our personal family with our player family.

Did you have a favorite female athlete you looked up to as a child? How did seeing this representation inspire you to pursue sports?My two favorite female athletes were Monica Seles and Mia Hamm. I looked up to Monica because she played two hands on both sides, which is how I play. I learned by myself on the backboard, I didn't know most players hit with one hand on their forehand; so when I learned of Monica, I thought, if she can do it, I can do it. As for Mia Hamm, I loved soccer as a kid and continued to follow Mia and our ‘99 team in the World Cup. Those women became a huge inspiration for me and so many of my friends. To this day, I still love watching ESPN's 9 for 9 on them! I feel like they helped make playing sports as females exciting, fun and also doable with a family!

What advice would you give to young girls who dream of pursuing a career in sports?I would advise anyone to follow their passion, especially if it leads to a healthy lifestyle and one they can make a living/career out of. I love tennis, but what I love most is the relationships. I feel so lucky that I get to wake up and live my dream every day.

How do you think college tennis, and college sports in general, could better support female athletes and coaches? Are there any specific changes or initiatives you'd like to see in college athletics to uplift women?I think college sports could put together a general “nanny fund” that coaches can tap into when they need help continuing their career once they have a baby. I believe there are plenty of donors who would help make this happen. I also feel that female coaches would have higher salaries if they shared what they make, similar to men. However, women typically don't share that information. If college sports made it easy to access an Excel sheet, I think they could let the numbers do the talking when you compare salaries to rankings. Another area in which I believe college sports could help female athletes is to teach them about fertility. Miscarriages happen frequently, I believe it's nearly 1 out of 6 times. If young women knew ahead of time that they wanted to focus on their careers for their first 6-10 years after college, then they would benefit from knowing what their fertility options were. Often, women don't realize they are “running out of time” until they are 10 years into their career and ready to start a family.

What impact or legacy do you hope to leave for your program or the sport overall?I hope to impact my players' lives off the tennis court more than on the tennis court.  If my players can graduate from Tennessee with their degrees and use lessons learned and relationships made to help them become better friends, partners, mothers and spouses, then I would feel pretty good about the overall impact we were able to make. I saw this because there are a lot of coaches and support staff who pour so much into our student athletes.

Local favourite Tommy Paul was beaten in straight sets by former US Open champion Daniil Medvedev in the round of 16.

Daniil Medvedev of Russia shook off a day of rain delays to beat local hope Tommy Paul 6-4, 6-0 and reach the quarterfinals at Indian Wells, California, where he is vying to improve on runner-up finishes the past two years.

Taking to the court at about 10pm local time on Tuesday, four hours after he was slated to open the night session on Stadium Court, Medvedev took full advantage of Paul's 31 unforced errors.

“It wasn't an easy preparation,” Medvedev said. “We both were here early and then rain, rain, rain. I think we both went in rusty, he a little bit more than I did.”

Paul had his opportunities, rallying after Medvedev jumped to a 4-0 lead to win four straight games.

But Medvedev won the next eight – pocketing the first set on a pair of Paul forehand errors and then racing through the second to seal it with one final break of the American's serve.

“Pretty strange score,” Medvedev said. “Whoever won some games won them in a row.”

Medvedev, who fell to Carlos Alcaraz in each of the last two finals, next faces France's Arthur Fils, a 6-2, 2-6, 6-3 winner over American Marcos Giron in a match that was halted for more than three hours by rain in the first set.

AUBURN, Ala. – Auburn is set to host two SEC opponents and a non-conference match this week at the Yarbrough Tennis Center in Auburn, Alabama. The Tigers will face No. 18 Oklahoma on Thursday at noon CT followed by Belmont at 5 p.m. CT. On Saturday, Auburn will finish the weekend with another SEC match against Ole Miss at 1 p.m. CT.

“It'll be good to be back home and this season we have played really well at home,” said Auburn head coach Bobby Reynolds. “Oklahoma is going to come out with fire. They try to bring a tough environment with them to every single match. They've been great this year in doubles and have been very successful at their No. 4 and No. 5 positions. We've never come across them in a dual match so it will be a first for us, but we know that if we can take their legs out in the doubles, it will set us up well for the singles.

“If you look at Ole Miss, they are the opposite. They've struggled in the doubles point but have been successful in coming back to win four singles matches often in SEC play. It's a credit to them for not always getting that first emotional point but being able to reset and find success in singles.”

Auburn struggled during its trip to both of the conference's Texas schools last week, dropping both matches to No. 15 Texas A&M and No. 4 Texas. Freshman Alex Frusina was a bright spot for the Tigers, as he picked up two ranked singles wins and helped clinch the doubles point in a tiebreaker against Texas A&M.

After losing the first set to No. 45 JC Roddick on Thursday, Frusina came back to win the match 1-6, 6-4, 6-4 which tied the team score at two at the time. On Sunday, Frusina defeated No. 13 Sebastian Gorzny for his highest ranked singles win of the season. With the second set tied at five, Frusina earned a crucial break and held in the next game to win the match in straight sets.

Auburn holds a 10-6 overall record this season and is 2-4 in conference matches. The team appeared at No. 39 in the latest ITA National Team Rankings that were released on Tuesday.

Oklahoma will enter Thursday's first ever meeting against Auburn with a 10-4 overall this season and with a 3-2 record in SEC matches. In their first season in the conference, the Sooners have posted wins over Arkansas, Tennessee and Florida but have dropped matches to Texas A&M and Mississippi State.

Oscar Lacides, ranked No. 76 nationally, has been the regular No. 1 singles player for Oklahoma this season, posting a 9-4 dual match record. Lacides and Bruno Nhavene have had a good season for the Sooners so far, posting a 12-3 overall record and a 4-2 record at the top doubles position. The duo has a national doubles ranking of No. 39.

Auburn second opponent of the day on Thursday, Belmont, holds a 6-8 overall record this season but has won each of its last two matches over Lipscomb and Mercer. The Tigers won their only other meeting against the Bruins in 2017 by a 4-0 score.

Ole Miss currently holds an 11-4 overall record and a 2-3 mark in SEC matches. The Rebels will face No. 21 Tennessee in Knoxville on Thursday before facing Auburn on Saturday. Last week at home, Ole Miss posted a 4-3 win over No. 21 Alabama before being shut out by South Carolina 0-4.

Both the singles and doubles lineups have fluctuated for Ole Miss this season. Freshman Matthieu Chambonniere has been consistent for the Rebels this season in the bottom portion of the singles lineup, posting an 11-2 dual record this season.

Admission to all three matches at the Yarbrough Tennis Center will be free. Fans in attendance on Thursday will receive a free Auburn Tennis T-shirt while supplies last. For Saturday's match against Ole Miss, the first fans in attendance will have the opportunity to enjoy free Moe's Original BBQ while supplies last.

Live video and live scoring of each match will be available online at AuburnTigers.com and the Auburn Tigers app.","{'href': 'http://www.auburntigers.com', 'title': 'Auburn Tigers Official Athletic Site'}"

People protesting against Tesla should be labelled domestic terrorists, President Donald Trump said on Tuesday at a White House media event designed to bolster Elon Musk's electric car company.

Trump sat in the driver's seat of a brand new red Tesla that he said he planned to buy, with Musk in the passenger seat, but did not test drive it.

Demonstrators have targeted Tesla showrooms in recent weeks in protest against Musk's cost-cutting role in Trump's administration.

Trump said they were ""harming a great American company"", and anyone using violence against the electric carmaker would ""go through hell"".

The president described the shiny red Model-S, one of a number of Teslas lined up on the White House drive, as ""beautiful"" but said he was no longer allowed to drive and so would keep the car for the use of White House staff. Current and former presidents are not allowed to drive for security reasons.

He also said he would not want to buy a self-driving model, which Musk said would reach the market next year.

The showcase for Tesla's cars outside the White House came after Tesla's market value halved since its all-time peak in December, sliding 15% in a single day on Monday, before recovering slightly on Tuesday.

Trump said he had told Musk, ""You know, Elon, I don't like what's happening to you, and Tesla's a great company.""

Musk, Trump's top donor in the election campaign, has been tasked with radically cutting government spending through his Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). 

He has instigated sweeping cuts to federal workforce, cancelled international aid programmes, and has voiced support for far-right politics.

That has prompted a backlash among Tesla owners.

""Tesla takedown"" protests have seen demonstrators gather outside dealerships, in Portland, Oregon, last week, and New York City earlier in March, with the aim of undermining the Tesla brand. 

Organisers behind the protests said on social media that the demonstrations were peaceful, but a few have been destructive with fires intentionally set at Tesla showrooms and charging stations in Colorado and Massachusetts last week.

Asked in front of the White House whether such protesters should be labelled ""domestic terrorists"", the president said ""I will do that"", a position later confirmed by a White House spokesperson.

""You do it to Tesla and you do it to any company, we're going to catch you and you're going to go through hell,"" Trump said.

On his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump blamed Tesla's share price falls on ""radical left lunatics"", who he said were trying to ""illegally and collusively boycott"" the firm.

However, stock analysts said the main reason for the poor performance of the shares was fear about Tesla meeting production targets and a drop in sales over the past year.

UBS warned that new Tesla deliveries could be much lower than expected this year.

Lindsay James, an investment strategist at Quilter Investors, said that although there was ""an element"" of Elon Musk's politics having a ""brand impact"", there were other reasons for the share price fall.

Ultimately the drop came down to ""hard numbers"", she said.

""When we look at new orders, for example in Europe and China, you can see that they've effectively halved over the last year,"" she said.

Sales in Europe have fallen sharply this year. Across the continent, they were down 45% in January compared to the same month in 2024, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA).

There has also been a steep decline in China – a key market – and Australia.

Other experts have said Tesla is over-valued, so the fall is seen as a correction, while others have pointed to rising competition from some of China's electric vehicle companies.

Investors are ""certainly getting more worried about an economic slowdown too, so the richest-valued companies like Tesla have been hit hardest in recent days"", Ms James said.

There have also been concerns that Musk has not been focusing enough of his attention on his firms.

In an interview with Fox Business on Monday, he said he was combining the Doge role with running his businesses ""with great difficulty"".

Alongside Tesla, his businesses include Space X, which has experienced serious failures in the last two launches of its giant Starship rocket, and the social media network X, which suffered an outage on Monday.

Despite his supportive comments, President Trump's policies so far have been designed to limit electric car sales in the US, including revoking a 2021 order by former president Joe Biden that half of all car sales should be electric by 2030, and halting unspent government funds for charging stations.

Trump's tariffs could also hurt the manufacturer. Tesla chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja said in January Tesla parts sourced from Canada and Mexico would be subject to the levies and that this could hit profitability.

Tesla's share price fall came against a broader US market slump on Monday as investors, concerned about the economic effects of Trump tariffs and weakening confidence in the economy, sold shares.

Trump's own economic policies on tariffs are also making investors nervous, analysts said.

The US president also accuses the EU of treating the US ""very badly"" as the tariff tit-for-tat continues. 

The Columbia University graduate had a key role in student protests over Gaza. Trump said his arrest was the first of ""many to come"". 

Mahmoud Khalil, a US permanent resident, participated in protests against the war in Gaza at Columbia University in New York. 

Cutbacks have been announced at the department, which the US president has pledged to eliminate altogether.

The five-star Ayrshire resort was targeted by activists in the early hours of Saturday.

The Trump administration raised tariffs on global steel and aluminum imports to 25% Wednesday as President Donald Trump and his administration dig in on trade policies that have rocked financial markets.

Allies of the U.S., such as the European Union, responded in kind with a hail of criticism and reciprocal tariffs. The EU announced retaliatory tariffs early Wednesday on $28 billion-worth of a wide range of U.S. goods imported to Europe such as boats, motorbikes and alcohol. 

President Trump announced the tariffs last month and the White House said Wednesday that there would be no exceptions. 

“President Trump has once again used the leverage of the American economy, which is the best and biggest in the world, to deliver a win for the American people,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement.

Calling the new U.S. tariffs “unjustified,” the European Commission said that the levies would kick in on April 1, with additional countermeasures introduced in mid-April. 

Investors appeared unfazed as they sent U.S. stock futures higher in advance of the release of the latest Consumer Price Index report Wednesday, though major stock indexes remain sharply lower in recent weeks. The S&P 500 is down almost 9% from its February high, putting it in correction territory.

While President Trump has suggested he wants to negotiate a broader trade agreement with the U.K., Britain did not escape the taxes. U.K. business and trade secretary Jonathan Reynolds called the levies “disappointing,” but said his country was “focused on a pragmatic approach” and negotiating a broader deal.

The European reaction echoed that of Canada, another of America's traditional close allies and trading partners, on which Trump had already imposed a 25% metals tax.

New tariffs were briefly expected to go even higher for Canada, the top U.S. export market. President Donald Trump said Tuesday they would jump to 50% in response to Ontario Premier Doug Ford's threat to impose a 25% surcharge on electricity imports into the United States to match the initial U.S. hike.

A conversation between Ford and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, prevented this though, with Trump indicating a doubling of U.S. tariffs for Canada was no longer likely.

In a joint-statement with Lutnick posted on X, Ford said they would meet Thursday alongside the U.S. trade representative to discuss renewing the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade act.

In a Truth Social post Monday, Trump called Canada a longtime “tariff abuser,” going beyond his metals threats to say that “The United States is not going to be subsidizing Canada any longer,” and that “We don't need your Cars, we don't need your Lumber, we don't your Energy, and very soon, you will find that out.”

Other long-time U.S. allies also failed to escape. 

Australia, which had been hoping for the same exemption from steel and aluminum tariffs it received during the first Trump administration, said it would not retaliate.

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the tariff “entirely unjustified,” but added that imposing reciprocal tariffs “would only push up prices for Australian consumers,” and that Australia would impose no new tariffs on U.S. goods.

Perhaps the sharpest response came from China, the world's largest steel producer and second-largest economy, which had already been slapped with a 20% blanket tariff on Trump's return to office, and announced new tariffs in return. 

Beijing's foreign ministry accused the U.S. of violating World Trade Organization rules and said it would take “all necessary measures” to protect its rights and interests. 

“No one wins in a trade war or a tariff war, a view widely shared by the international community,” spokesperson Mao Ning said at a media briefing.

America's Asian allies in South Korea and Japan — both are major steel producers — were also hit. 

South Korea, which Trump singled out in his address to Congress last week over its tariff policies, is scrambling to minimize the impact of U.S. tariffs on its domestic industries. Trade Minister Cheong In-kyo's office said Wednesday he will be in Washington for two days starting Thursday for tariff discussions.

Yoshimasa Hayashi, the Japanese government's top spokesperson, told reporters in Tokyo it was “regrettable” that the new U.S. tariffs had been imposed “without excluding Japan.”

Stock market investors have made their feelings about the tariffs clear, with major indexes plunging on Trump's earlier tariff threats, before rallying on the suspension announcement for Canada.

Pre-market futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq all inched higher early Wednesday after plunging in recent days. 

Aside from steel and aluminum, Trump on Tuesday called on Canada to drop its duties on U.S. dairy products and threatened to ""substantially increase"" tariffs on cars imported into the United States if Canada did not drop ""other egregious, long time tariffs.""

The auto tariffs, Trump warned, without citing evidence, “essentially, permanently shut down the automobile manufacturing business in Canada.” He also doubled down on some of his recent rhetoric about making Canada part of the United States.

Canada has quickly emerged as a target of Trump's ire in his second term. Trump this month instituted, then pulled back, tariffs on a variety of Canadian goods as he goaded its leaders and blamed them for a lack of action on fentanyl trafficking. 

Relatively little of the drug is seized at the U.S.'s northern border compared with that with Mexico.

While Mexico has faced similar tariff threats and rhetoric, its president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has succeeded in assuaging Trump.

Newly appointed Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney subsequently called Trump's threats ""an attack on Canadian workers, families and businesses.""

He said Canadian tariffs on U.S. goods would remain ""until the Americans show us respect and make credible, reliable commitments to free and fair trade.""

Morgan Stanley analysts warned that because the United States is a net importer of steel and aluminum from Canada, the tariffs would lead to higher domestic prices.

Verizon Business takes first-of-its-kind approach to network-native security for business with end-to-end solution that can be embedded in customer networks

Full Transparency 

No Updates

NEW YORK — Businesses of all sizes can now bolster cybersecurity along the complete digital pathway from their connected devices through their IT networks all the way to cloud-hosted SaaS applications with Trusted Connection, a new cybersecurity solution from Verizon Business. Instead of simply forming a secure perimeter around your digital landscape, Trusted Connection secures the connection and endpoints from any user device to any digital resource, spanning web/cloud, SaaS, private apps and more.

Trusted Connection is particularly suitable for larger midsize businesses that need enhanced security but don't have the resources or dedicated expertise to install and run it themselves, or for enterprises looking to simplify the management of their security.

“Having the right cybersecurity architecture in place is one of the most important responsibilities technology decision-makers face. Ensuring end-to-end security is critical,” said Kyle Malady, CEO, Verizon Business. “If a perimeter is breached, bad actors can wreak havoc. Trusted Connection creates a protected environment within the outer walls of security, protecting each specific entry point and pathway that could lead a bad actor to a valuable digital asset. It's sophisticated security technology combined with an ease of use that makes cybersecurity accessible to businesses of all sizes.”

“Cloud-related security is an urgent and escalating problem, but few enterprises have the resources to keep safe in real time as exploitable technologies gain ground. The service can dramatically reduce attack surface by encrypting paths between cloud and endpoint.” said Camille Mendler, Chief Analyst, Service Provider Enterprise, Omdia. “Trusted Connection's seamless network-native security offers a huge step forward in functionality and control -- especially for mid-sized companies that face similar threats as large enterprises but often lack the resources to address quickly evolving security threats comprehensively.”

According to the 2024 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report, 77% of basic web application attacks and 31% of all breaches in the past 10 years involved the use of stolen credentials. Trusted Connection can help contain the negative impacts of stolen credentials by enforcing ZTNA on network connections, checking device security posture, providing access from a managed device and by enforcing multi-factor authentication on access as designated by administrators.

The Arizona business community and policy leaders will convene at the Arizona Biltmore next month for the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry's annual Update from Capitol Hill luncheon.

This premier event, presented by Salt River Project, will feature an in-depth conversation with U.S. Senators Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego, offering valuable insights into the latest federal policies impacting Arizona's economy and business community. 

This year's edition will mark the first appearance at Update from Capitol Hill for Senators Kelly and Gallego. With so much happening in Washington that affects Arizona, the perspectives of the state's two U.S. senators will be instrumental in helping business leaders understand how federal policies impact their bottom line. 

What to expect

Attendees will gain firsthand updates on federal initiatives related to international trade, defense & aerospace, health care, economic development, infrastructure investments, and workforce growth. With Arizona job creators facing both opportunities and challenges in areas such as water security, energy policy, and border trade, this year's discussion will be particularly timely. 

Event Details:

This luncheon serves as a unique opportunity for Arizona's business community to engage directly with federal policymakers, gain insight into upcoming legislation, and network with key stakeholders committed to economic growth and policy advocacy. Seating is limited, and early registration is encouraged. For more information and to secure your spot, visit the Chamber's event page.

Chloe Mohatt had reservations about leaving her native Montana to attend Grand Canyon University following the sudden loss of a friend.

And as a senior business management major, Mohatt was hesitant to start a coffee venture and instead remain on path toward a corporate career.

Thanks to a nudge by professor Robert Vera, Mohatt is off to a promising start in pursuing a career in producing and selling coffee while honoring her late friend with a commitment to helping college ministries.

“GCU has been the biggest blessing ever and has brought me so many amazing opportunities in the community,” Mohatt said at a February Marketplace event, about an hour before her Easy Soul Café products sold out for the second consecutive time.

Mohatt's determination to succeed and help others is convincing, simply from the manner in which she spoke about honoring her friend, who committed suicide months before Mohatt was scheduled to enroll at GCU.

Her friend was a barista with a comfortable personality, so Mohatt thought “Easy Soul” was an appropriate way to honor her.

“That's what I want Easy Soul to be built on, is just human connection and love for others,” Mohatt said. “I want people to walk into this space and feel invited and welcomed with open arms. The coffee industry has so much room for growth, and a lot of people don't use it to its full potential.”

At the same time, Mohatt envisions helping those who have been impacted by sudden deaths in her hometown of Kalispell, Montana.

“My town actually went through a very tragic suicide epidemic where we had double digit suicides happen within 1 ½ years,” Mohatt said. “My town is a very small town that doesn't see the sun very often, and seasonal depression is a super big problem.”

The suicide rate in Flathead County (where Kalispell is located) rose from 26.83 per 100,000 in 2019 to 39.29 in 2021, according to the Flathead City-County Health Department. Seven students in the Kalispell Public Schools system committed suicide during a 16-month span from May 2020-August 2021, according to the Flathead (County) Beacon.

“I'm a firm believer there's a lot of spiritual warfare going on there. My community faced a lot of deaths, and it definitely drew us closer together and encouraged us to live every day to the fullest and to do things to honor them and glorify the Lord,"" said Mohatt, such as creating a legacy for her friend. ""So that's been a big motivation for doing that.”

Mohatt serves on the Christ Church college ministry leadership team, a role that she said has changed her life. She plans to donate from 10 to 20 percent of her proceeds from Easy Soul to college ministry to help “defeat the darkness of suicide and depression” while helping build the Kingdom.

“I've seen the Lord transform my life for the better, and I have that desire for everyone who is getting defeated by the enemy at the moment by suicide, depression and anxiety,” Mohatt said.

Based on sales, Easy Soul is providing a refreshing boost for students.

“It was such a blessing I pulled the trigger when I did, thanks to Robert.”

Said Vera: “How did you pull the trigger? You were a little reluctant.”

Entering her senior year at GCU, Mohatt was preparing for a career in the corporate world while living minimally after graduation. Saving money would give her the potential to start her coffee business down the road, “which is silly and the safe way to go, but I'm very glad I just decided to do it.”

With less than 15 hours before the first Marketplace, Mohatt purchased a coffee maker that didn't produce the volume she initially sought and caused a mess.

Nevertheless, she managed to clear $17 in her first Marketplace after expenses. The process of producing and selling coffee has become much smoother and profitable as she paid off all equipment and a coffee cart. She makes her own syrup flavors to concoct drinks such as cherry vanilla, cake batter, cinnamon roll and honey lavender while receiving input from students and family members.

“I've done a few events off campus and even in my parents' neighborhood,” Mohatt said. “I ended up being in a lot of revenue. I'm working on all my licensing and other paperwork to get registered at farmer's markets – hopefully this summer.”

Mohatt realizes the coffee business is extremely competitive and saturated in markets such as Scottsdale. She has an eye on the West Valley, perhaps setting up at City Center in Surprise.

An array of friends have helped Mohatt produce drinks at marketplaces on campus.

“At times it's been stressful because people have jobs and lives,” Mohatt said. “Luckily the Lord always provides, and I have help and people who are willing to come and help Easy Soul keep going.”

The merging of its corporate teams at Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go resulted in an untold number of layoffs

March 12, 2025

Amazon is restructuring the corporate teams for its grocery and convenience store brands and laying off some employees who work on their Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go chains, the online retailer confirmed.

“We regularly review our team structures to ensure we're best set up to serve customers. Following a recent review, we've identified a very small number of roles in the Worldwide Grocery Stores org that are no longer required. We've already notified employees whose roles are impacted, and we're committed to supporting them through their transition,” an Amazon spokesperson said in an email to Supermarket News on Wednesday.

Amazon operates more than a dozen Amazon Go stores across the Seattle, Chicago, New York City, and Los Angeles areas. The Seattle-based online giant also operates 63 Amazon Fresh Grocery stores across the U.S., as of Feb. 15, according to ScrapeHero.com.

Employees who leave the company will receive a severance offer and access to career transition services, as well as 60 days of pay and benefits and access to transitional health benefits. 

It's unclear how many employees were laid off in the restructuring. 

The corporate shakeup comes about a month-and-a-half after Whole Foods Market CEO Jason Buechel was named to lead Amazon's Worldwide Grocery Stores organization, which was established in 2022. 

Claire Peters leads the online retailer's Amazon Fresh, Amazon Go, and Grocery Partnerships business.

“This expanded responsibility gives me an opportunity to look after the collective grocery offering across Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods Market, Amazon Go and Grocery Partnerships,” Buechel said in a LinkedIn post in late January. “And help move forward our goal of making grocery shopping simpler, faster, and more affordable for customers.”

Amazon's grocery business has been in a constant state of change for several years now, the most recent major update being the launch of its newest concept, Amazon Grocery, in Chicago in October. 

“Customers shopping at Whole Foods Market today are looking for natural and organic products. However, we know that many of them also visit additional stores to grab their favorite national grocery brands or household essentials to complete their weekly shop,” Amazon said in a prepared statement in October. “Through Amazon.com, Amazon Fresh, Amazon Go, Whole Foods Market, third-party grocery partners, and this new shopping experience, we offer a wide selection of national and local brands plus fresh, high-quality produce, meat, and seafood.”

Southwest, which built years of advertising campaigns around its policy of letting passengers check up to two bags for free, said Tuesday that people who haven't either reached the upper tiers of its Rapid Rewards loyalty program, bought a business class ticket or hold the airline's credit card will have to pay for checked bags.

The airline did not outline the fee schedule but said the new policy would start with flights booked on May 28.

“We have tremendous opportunity to meet current and future customer needs, attract new customer segments we don't compete for today, and return to the levels of profitability that both we and our shareholders expect,” CEO Bob Jordan said in a statement.

Less than a year ago, the Dallas-based airline announced it was doing away with another tradition, the open-boarding system it has used for more than 50 years. Southwest expects to begin operating flights with passengers in assigned seats next year.

Southwest has struggled recently and is under pressure from activist investors to boost profits and revenue. The airline reached a truce in October with hedge fund Elliott Investment Management to avoid a proxy fight, but Elliott won several seats on the company board.

The airline announced last month that it was eliminating 1,750 jobs, or 15% of its corporate workforce, in the first major layoffs in the company's 53-year history.

The job cuts, which were scheduled to be mostly completed by the end of June, are part of a plan to slash costs and transform the company into a “leaner, faster, and more agile organization,” Jordan said at the time.

Southwest's stock rose more than 9% Tuesday.

As recently as Southwest's investor day in late September, airline executives described the bags-fly-free as the most important feature in setting Southwest apart from rivals. All other leading U.S. airlines charge for checked luggage, and Wall Street has long argued that Southwest was leaving money behind.

The airline estimated in September that charging bag fees would bring in about $1.5 billion a year but cost the airline $1.8 billion in lost business from customers who chose to fly Southwest because of its generous baggage allowance.

Southwest said Tuesday that it would continue to offer two free checked bags to Rapid Rewards A-List preferred members and customers traveling on Business Select fares, and one free checked bag to A-List members and other select customers. Passengers with Rapid Rewards credit cards will receive a credit for one checked bag.

People who don't qualify for those categories will get charged to check bags. The airline said that it also would roll out a new, basic fare on its lowest priced tickets when the change takes effect.

“I would rather have the free checked bags, that's for sure,” said customer Dorothy Severson, who was awaiting a flight Tuesday at Chicago Midway International Airport. “It's one of the main reasons I still fly Southwest.”

Southwest is betting that the added bag fees will outweigh the loss of business from travelers who look closely at the costs on top of ticket prices. Rivals on Tuesday saw an opening.

“I think clearly there are some customers who chose them because of that, and now those customers are up for grabs,” said Delta Airlines President Glen Hauenstein, speaking at the J.P. Morgan Industrials Conference.

Yet in the current economic environment, keeping travel affordable may play an outsized roll in staying competitive. The trade war initiated by President Donald Trump is roiling U.S. markets and dampening the high-flying optimism prevalent last year among businesses and households.

To start the week, Delta slashed its quarterly earnings and revenue expectations, saying that a recent decline in consumer and corporate confidence over the economy is weakening domestic demand. Shares of Delta have tumbled 24% this year.

Shares of United have slumped 22%, JetBlue 27% and American Airlines a whopping 32%.

On Tuesday, Southwest cut its own expectations for the quarter. The airline now anticipates revenue per available seat mile will rise between 2% and 4%. That is down sharply from its previous projections of a 5% to 7% increase. The airline said it expects capacity to be down about 2%.

The airline announced last year that along with giving passengers assigned seats, it would charge them extra for with more legroom and offer red-eye flights.

U.S. job openings rose at the start of the year, another sign the job market was solid when President Donald Trump returned to the White House.

U.S. employers posted 7.7 million vacancies in January, the Labor Department reported Tuesday, up from 7.5 million. The outlook for the labor market is murky as Trump wages a trade war with foreign countries, purges federal workers and threatens to deport millions of immigrants.

Layoffs fell slightly in January, and the number of Americans quitting their jobs rose.

The Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed that openings rose in real estate, healthcare, manufacturing and construction firms. Federal government agencies posted 135,000 jobs, down from 138,000 in December.

The fallout from purges of federal workers by billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency is not expected to show up in labor market data at least until the February numbers come out.

“These January data included only the earliest days of DOGE-inspired layoffs of Federal workers,” Carol Weinberg and Mary Chen of High Frequency Economics wrote in a commentary. “There is no evidence of Federal Government layoffs in this report. That does not mean that layoffs in size in Federal workers will not be a big feature of the February report, scheduled for release on April 1.''

Weinberg and Chen said that Tuesday's JOLTS report is unlikely to sway the Federal Reserve from its cautious approach toward cutting interest rates this year. The Fed is expected to leave its benchmark rate alone at its meeting next week. “The (Fed) will find no cause to rush to cut rates in today's data,” they wrote. “The labor market does not need it, at least not yet.''

Openings are down from 8.5 million in January 2024 and a peak of 12.2 million in March 2022 when the economy was roaring back from COVID-19 lockdowns.

The American labor market has slowed from the frenzied hiring of 2021-2023. Employers added 168,000 jobs a month in 2024, decent but down from 216,000 in 2023, 380,000 in 2022 and a record 603,000 in 2021.

They created 125,000 new jobs in January and 151,000 in February. The unemployment rate is a low 4.1%.

Donald Trump has halted a plan to double US tariffs on Canadian steel and metal imports to 50%, just hours after first threatening them.

Tariffs of 25% still went ahead and took effect on Wednesday.

The move by the president comes after the Canadian province of Ontario suspended new charges of 25% on electricity that it sends to some northern states in the US, hours after Trump threatened to sharply increase his tariffs on the country. 

It marked the latest skirmish in a trade war that risks economic damage to the two North American neighbours. 

""Cooler heads prevailed,"" Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro told broadcaster CNBC, confirming that Trump would not move forward with his latest tariff threats.

Canada, one of America's closest trade partners, has borne the brunt of Trump's ire as he has launched trade battles in his first months in office. 

Trump has hit goods from the country, along with Mexico, with a blanket 25% tariff, though he signed orders temporarily exempting a significant number of items from the new duties, which he said were a response to drugs and migrants crossing into the US. 

Canada is also facing 25% tariffs on its steel and aluminium, which are set to go into effect on Wednesday, after Trump said he was ending exemptions to the duties previously granted to some countries. 

Canada has called Trump's attacks unjustified and announced retaliation, including new tariffs on C$30bn ($22bn; £16bn) of US products. 

Ford had announced he would tax electricity exports to the US in an effort to get those tariffs removed. 

He had also previously said he would ""not hesitate to shut off electricity completely"" if the US ""escalates"".

Announcing the decision to suspend the electricity duties, Ford said he thought it was the ""right decision"" to try to focus the discussions on the wider North American free trade deal.

""With any negotiation that we have, there's a point that both parties are heated and the temperature needs to come down,"" he said,  thanking Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick for contacting him about a meeting.

""They understand how serious we are,"" he added. ""We have both agreed, let cooler heads prevail. We need to sit down and move this forward.""

In his social media post early on Tuesday, which threatened to double levies on Canadian steel and aluminium, Trump said he was responding to Ford's moves. 

He also criticised Canada for relying on the US for ""military protection"", and reiterated that he wanted the country to become the 51st US state.

He added that it ""would make all tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear"" if Canada were to join the US as a state.

The White House declared the episode a win, saying in a statement that Trump had ""once again used the leverage of the American economy, which is the best and biggest in the world, to deliver a win for the American people"".

Tariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries.

The companies that bring the foreign goods into the country pay the tax to the government. 

The back-and-forth came during a turbulent time for markets.

The S&P 500 index of the largest firms listed in the US fell a further 0.7% on Tuesday after dropping 2.7% on Monday, which was its biggest one-day drop since December.

The UK's FTSE 100 share index, which had edged lower earlier on Tuesday, fell further following Trump's latest comments and closed down more than 1%. The French Cac 40 index and German Dax followed a similar pattern.

Monday's stock market sell-off had begun after Trump said the economy was in a ""transition"" when asked about whether the US was heading for a recession.

Investors have been concerned about the economic effects of Trump's trade policies, which it is feared could push up inflation in the US and beyond, while uncertainty leads to economic paralyisis.

Even before Tuesday's comments, Trump's tariffs had already been causing concern for US businesses.

On Monday, Jason Goldstein, founder of Icarus Brewing, a small beer-maker in New Jersey that employs 50 people, told the BBC that previous tariff announcements had prompted a slew of emails from his suppliers. 

They have been warning that price increases for everything from grain and aluminium cans are likely to be coming.

Mr Goldstein has stockpiled an extra month's supply of cans and held off on new purchases as a result of the uncertainty and rapidly changing situation.

""It's definitely a worrying time for us,"" he said.

""Never before in my life have I had to read so much news, watch so much news to know, here's what my industry's going to look like tomorrow.""

Canada and the EU have announced retaliatory tariffs but UK will take a ""pragmatic"" approach, the prime minister said.

How much will the UK be hit by US tariffs and what happens next?

Stock market falls, tariffs and other changes are reigniting fear of economic downturn in the US. 

Tariffs are a central part of Trump's political vision, but economists fear they could spark a trade war.

Economists say the president's import taxes could result in higher prices for a range of products in the US.

MORGANTOWN — To say that WVU football – and the philosophies of head coach Rich Rodriguez – are ingrained in his son Rhett would be an understatement.

There's a photo of Rhett Rodriguez as a young child, sitting on the knee of former WVU quarterback Rasheed Marshall when Marshall led the Mountaineers. When Rhett Rodriguez played quarterback in high school, he would suggest strategies to his coach from his dad's playbook.

“I probably drove him crazy with all those things, like, ‘you know, we do this play, can we put that in?'” Rhett Rodriguez remembered with a smile. “He was like, ‘Rhett, you'll get there eventually.'”

That he has, now serving as his dad's quarterback coach at WVU. And both father and son say that, if you're looking for a coach to best deliver the message of how Rich Rodriguez's offense operates, who's a better messenger than the person who grew up with it?

“I've been around our football programs, all the places we've been to,” Rhett Rodriguez said. “So sometimes I know what he's looking for and I'm able to kind of read between the lines of the message he's trying to share.”

While Rhett Rodriguez ended up in coaching, it wasn't where he started out of college. He began his professional life in the financial field, at Northern Trust in Tempe, Arizona. There, he developed exchange strategies and fund trading.

Even as he found success in the financial world, his dad would poke at him, asking if that was what he really wanted to do, or if he would rather coach. Rhett Rodriguez was able to work a hybrid schedule and still fly to Jacksonville State where his dad was last head coach to observe. 

Finally, father was able to get son to admit that, while he was having fun in the financial world, he wasn't having as much fun as he would as a coach.

“Well, I said, I don't know how much longer I'll be in this,” Rich Rodriguez said. “But you have one advantage. You've kind of got some connections. You have better connections than when I started.”

Rhett Rodriguez spent last season at Jacksonville State as an offensive analyst before Rich Rodriguez hired him as quarterbacks coach upon their return to Morgantown. While his coaching resume is short, he has experience as a Football Bowl Subdivision quarterback at two schools – Arizona and Louisiana-Monroe.

What Rhett Rodriguez has found is that his experience in the business world has prepared him for many of the aspects of college football. The new horizons of name, image and likeness have bolstered the business side of the sport, and the younger Rodriguez has a good base of experience there.

It also has helped in recruiting. Rhett Rodriguez said that part of his job at Northern Trust was to cold-call financial advisors to convince them to use his company's products. After that experience, he said, wooing football recruits isn't so tough.

“That helped translate over to where having a phone call with an 18-year-old recruit is a lot easier than with someone who has been a financial advisor in a suit for 30 years,” he said.

Rich Rodriguez said there are several benefits to having his son as his quarterback coach, most importantly his demeanor. The elder Rodriguez has joked several times during spring practice that it's better that Rhett Rodriguez is the coach talking to the quarterback in-game into the QB's earpiece. Rich Rodriguez might spend too much time yelling about a mistake. Rhett Rodriguez has the calm to make sure the right play gets called in.

“My dad kind of has to have a global view,” Rhett Rodriguez said. “He's not just looking at the quarterback. He's looking at the offensive line and the defense, too. I have my pure focus on getting the quarterback ready to go.

“I think also having that calm demeanor, helping the quarterbacks out, my dad can focus on calling the plays and I can be the one communicating that to the quarterback,” he said.

Rich Rodriguez said he couldn't be prouder of his son, how he has grown so quickly as a coach. And feels Rhett Rodriguez will only get better.

“People say, well, you're biased because he's your son,” Rich Rodriguez said. “You're damn right. But I think if there's anybody in the country who knows the system better than everybody else, it would be him. I don't know if he knows it better than me, but he's right there with it.”

MORGANTOWN — At first glance, Gavin Kelly is not exactly what you'd expect out of a college catcher.

A fire  tore through a Santa Rosa dry cleaning business Tuesday night, causing extensive damage before firefighters brought it under control in 30 minutes, officials said.

Fire crews responded around 8:15 a.m. to Press Dry Cleaners, located in a Calistoga Road shopping center housing multiple businesses,  Battalion Chief Paul Ricci said in a news release. They found flames burning through the roof and called for additional resources as the fire spread inside.

Twenty-five firefighters worked to contain the blaze, extinguishing it within half an hour and mopping up hot spots, Ricci said.

It was unclear if anyone was inside at the time.

The popularity of Padel, currently the world's fastest-growing racket sport, is providing an opportunity for UK golf clubs to enhance their facilities, attract new members, and secure new long-term revenue streams.

In just five years, the popularity of padel in the UK has surged from 6,000 active players to over 230,000, with more than 750 courts installed nationwide. 

This trend is following key European countries such as Spain, where the sport boasts over 5 million players and ranks as the second most participated sport after football, ahead of tennis.

According to Keith Mitchell from Chiefs Digital Media, which provides strategic advice within the sector: “Padel aligns perfectly with golf's core audience – health-conscious individuals who appreciate skill-based, inclusive, and social sports. Many golf clubs across Europe have already adopted padel with great success, resulting in a broader, more engaged community.

“This not only boosts footfall and member retention but also increases primary revenue from annual memberships, pay as you play court hires and substantial secondary revenue from food and beverage. Also padel creates a vibrant clubhouse atmosphere that encourages cross-sport participation, making it particularly attractive to families and younger members.”





Tom Brunner, co-founder of Padel Home, which installs padel courts in the UK, adds: “For golf clubs, the primary advantage lies in enhancing leisure offerings that can generate incremental revenue while leveraging existing strengths. Padel courts require significantly less space than traditional tennis facilities. With hourly rates ranging from £40-£80 and utilization above 80%, the revenue potential is clear. A standard three-court covered padel facility could conservatively generate annual booking revenue of £305,000 based on just seven hours of usage per day, in addition to opportunities in food and beverage sales, coaching, corporate events, and merchandise.”

According to a recent report in The Times, David Lloyd Leisure, a leading UK health and fitness club operator, reported a 33% profit increase in 2024, largely due to the expansion of its padel and pickleball facilities.

Golf venues have multiple options to incorporate padel, from leasing space to padel operators, managing operations independently, or adopting hybrid models that retain certain operational aspects for increased revenue sharing.

“Companies like Padel Home are transforming how sports clubs can capitalise on the booming padel trend,” says Bruner. “We offer a comprehensive consultancy approach along with tailored solutions, including planning assistance, groundwork, court installation, and ongoing maintenance. Our flexible leasing and hire purchase options allow clubs to avoid significant upfront costs, making padel financially sustainable and accessible.”

Partnering with Padel Alba, a leading manufacturer from Spain with decades of experience in building and installing courts worldwide, Padel Home ensures high-quality installations. Brunner notes, “After months of discussing with major court manufacturers globally, we chose Alba for their outstanding product, commitment to customer service, and shared values.”

Recent installations include The Padel Hub in Slough, Utopia Padel in Ipswich, and several other flourishing padel companies. 

Mark Cracknell, founder of Utopia Padel, says: “Since we have introduced padel we have seen high levels of interest and engagement from the local community, cricket and tennis club. Feedback on the court from players has been very positive. The team at Padel Home has been incredibly responsive and helpful throughout the procurement and install process and we are looking forward to continuing to work with them in the future.”

When Joseph Weizenbaum created the world's first chatbot in 1966, user reactions alarmed the MIT professor. 

People were confiding their deepest thoughts to the chatbot and experts predicted that within a few years, conversations with chatbots would be indistinguishable from those with humans. It certainly took more than just a few years, but here we are at the edge of another stage of AI evolution.

Artificial intelligence has evolved significantly since 1966, advancing from basic rule-based systems to highly autonomous decision-making systems.

In the 1990s and early 2000s, rule-based chatbots relied on predefined keyword responses but lacked the ability to adapt to complex queries. By the 2010s, intelligent virtual assistants such as Alexa and Siri enhanced user interactions and introduced AI into everyday life through smart home integrations. In the 2020s, task-specific AI agents began to emerge, each tailored to perform specialized tasks. For instance, AI-driven personal finance assistants can analyze spending patterns and suggest savings plans, while AI-powered content moderation tools scan social media platforms to identify harmful content.

Looking ahead, autonomous AI systems are rapidly advancing. Multi-agent systems, composed of multiple independent agents, can collaborate to achieve a complex workflow beyond the ability of an individual agent. Tasks are coordinated between agents, as opposed to individual agents that often require human coordination and intervention between tasks. For example, in manufacturing, AI agents can independently optimize production lines, while in healthcare, AI systems are assisting in surgery by making real-time adjustments during procedures. Autonomous systems are also being deployed in logistics to manage inventory and optimize warehouse operations without human intervention.

Today, AI agents are like super-efficient digital teammates — smart systems equipped to perform tasks autonomously, learning from experience and adapting along the way.

Today's agents have core capabilities like these:

The answer lies in the remarkable advancements in foundation models. These models allow AI to handle complex data and produce outputs like code, text, or media that are tailored to specific tasks. They enable systems to think through problems deeply and autonomously, mirroring human cognitive processes.

For instance, the latest reasoning models like OpenAI's o1 and o3 are game changers. They do not just perform tasks; they use real-time computing power to “think” and generate human-like outcomes. And the progress is mind-blowing: o3 scored over 80 percent on a human-like reasoning test while its predecessor, GPT-4o, scored only two percent on the same test just one year earlier.

With such rapid advances, AI agents are getting better at automating and enhancing business decisions, truly pushing the limits of what autonomous systems can achieve.

The union positioned the two sides as being ""frustratingly far apart"" at the negotiating table in an update to members on Tuesday.


							By 

	Katie Kilkenny


Labor & Media Reporter


SAG-AFTRA has been on strike against major video game studios for more than seven months, and the two sides don't seem to be particularly close to making a deal.


	That's the impression that negotiators for the performers union gave to members in a message on Tuesday that warned that the companies' latest proposals contained “alarming loopholes that will leave our members vulnerable to AI abuse” — the very issue that prompted the union's current work stoppage in the first place.




	The memo, which contained a link to a chart showing the alleged gap between the union's and the employer's recent proposals on AI, claimed that the labor group is “frustratingly far apart” in its proposals from the video game studios, though the message said the studios might claim otherwise.

	A spokesperson for the companies that are negotiating the Interactive Media Agreement with the union stated that their deal proposal contains “wage increases of over 15% for SAG-AFTRA represented performers in video games, as well as enhanced health and safety protections, industry-leading terms of use for AI digital replicas in-game and additional compensation for the use of an actor's performance in other games.” The spokesperson added that the two sides have made “meaningful progress” and the companies are eager to return to the bargaining table.

	The firms currently in negotiations with SAG-AFTRA include Disney Character Voices, Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Warner Bros. Games, Insomniac Games and others. In October, that bargaining group stated that the two sides had reached tentative agreements on “24 out of 25 proposals.” 


	Nevertheless, SAG-AFTRA national executive director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland and Interactive Media negotiating chair Sarah Elmaleh wrote to members on Tuesday that the employers' last proposals would allow studios to use union members' past performances and outside performances “without any of the protections being bargained at all.” The negotiators also alleged that the studios' proposals would not require them to disclose how they used a digital replica after a performer has given their consent for how it can be used.


	With its chart, the union showed that it is attempting to negotiate specific AI language — provisions, for instance, that end performers' consent for use of their digital replica during a strike, that require additional reports from the studios regarding their use of digital replicas and that necessitate employer disclosure of whether a performer's voice will be combined with any other voices in a digital replica or whether it will be used for any kind of generative AI chatbot.

	











	The chart also demonstrates that the two parties have reached provisional deals on some issues: They have agreed to mandating that actors give their consent for digital replicas made using their performances and agreed on the amount of information that performers will receive about how their digital replicas are intended to be used in employment contracts. The labor and employer sides have also   been in accord on certain ways that performers can be compensated for their digital replicas, but have not resolved all their differences on payment.


	In its Tuesday message, the union also implored performers who don't usually work in video games to reject any jobs offered by struck companies. “If you're approached for such a role, we urge you to seriously consider the consequences. Not only would you be undermining the efforts of your fellow members, but you would be putting yourself at risk by working without protections against A.I. misuse,” the negotiators wrote.


	Nearly two years into their long-running negotiations with video game studios, SAG-AFTRA called a strike against those companies in July 2024. Negotiations have taken place in starts and stops ever since, with union performers occasionally picketing struck companies. The labor group's latest demonstration, at Disney Character Voices in Burbank, will take place on March 18.

Australia Won't Retaliate Against 'Unjustified' US Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum

MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Wednesday that U.S. tariffs on Australian steel and aluminum were unjustified, but his government would not retaliate with its own tariffs.

U.S. President Donald Trump said last month he was considering a tariff exemption for Australia, a free trade treaty partner that has traded with the United States at a deficit for decades.

A former Australian government secured an exemption with the previous Trump administration in 2018 based on arguments including that Australian steelmaker BlueScope employs thousands of workers in the U.S.

Albanese said he would continue to pursue an Australian exemption. The 2018 exemption took several months to secure.

“It has been foreshadowed that no country regardless of its relationship with the United States has been granted an exemption. Such a decision by the Trump administration is entirely unjustified,” Albanese said.

“Tariffs and escalating trade tensions are a form of economic self-harm and a recipe for slower growth and higher inflation. They are paid by the consumers. This is why Australia will not be imposing reciprocal tariffs on the United States,” Albanese added.

The U.S. officially increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25% on Wednesday.

The U.S. decision not to exempt Australia was announced days after a spat became public between Trump and the former Australian prime minister who secured the 2018 exemption, Malcolm Turnbull.

Trump described Turnbull, who quit politics in 2018 after being overthrown as prime minister by his own government, as a weak and ineffective leader.

“Malcolm Turnbull, the former Prime Minister of Australia who was always leading that wonderful country from 'behind', never understood what was going on in China, nor did he have the capacity to do so,” Trump wrote on social media.

READ:  

“I always thought he was a weak and ineffective leader and, obviously, Australian's (sic) agreed with me!!!” Trump added.

Trump was responding to an interview Turnbull gave this week to U.S. media company Bloomberg in which the former Australian leader said Chinese President Xi Jinping would take advantage of the U.S. president's chaotic and erratic leadership.

“I think China will take advantage, massive advantage of Trump,” Turnbull told Bloomberg.

“What my prediction will be that President Xi will aim to be the exact opposite of Trump. Where Trump is chaotic, he will be consistent. Where Trump is rude and abusive, he'll be respectful. Where Trump is erratic, he will be consistent,” Turnbull said.

“And what that will do is build trust with countries, and there'll be many countries who will, you know, looking at China on the one hand and Trump on the other, will find China a more attractive partner,” Turnbull added.

Governor Tiff Macklem warns the economic impact of Trump's trade war could be severe

The Bank of Canada cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday, citing trade uncertainty with the U.S. for the decision.

“In recent months, the pervasive uncertainty created by continuously changing U.S. tariff threats has shaken business and consumer confidence,” said Bank of Canada governor Tiff Macklem, during opening remarks in Ottawa. “This is restraining household spending intentions and businesses' plans to hire and invest.”

The decision to cut for the seventh consecutive time on Wednesday was largely expected by markets and economists and brings the central bank's overnight rate down to 2.75 per cent, in the middle of the bank's estimated neutral range.

“Depending on the extent and duration of new U.S. tariffs, the economic impact could be severe,” said Macklem.



The central bank estimates a protracted trade war could knock three per cent off Canada's growth over the next two years. The bank also estimates investment in Canada could decline by 12 per cent and exports could decrease by 8.5 per cent after the first year.

Macklem added that the “uncertainty alone is already causing harm.”

The central bank also published the results of surveys with businesses and consumers on Wednesday, which show how business and household spending sentiment has shifted.

Around 72 per cent of consumers expect costs to go up as a result of tariffs and 47 per cent of businesses think the same, according to a survey conducted between Jan. 29 and Feb. 28.



Around 48 per cent of businesses surveyed plan to reduce their investment plans and 40 per cent plan to pull back on hiring, with just two per cent of businesses saying they will increase investment.

Macklem said he expects some rise in the unemployment rate, if business investment continues to weaken in the second quarter of this year.

“Our surveys also suggest business intentions to raise prices have increased as they cope with higher costs related to both uncertainty and tariffs,” said Macklem. “At the same time, inflation expectations have moved up as Canadians brace for the possibility of higher prices.”

The bank expects inflation to rise to 2.5 per cent in March, after the end of the GST/HST federal tax break.

Macklem said the impact of tariffs on inflation will be more difficult to assess and will include a number of factors such as a weakening Canadian dollar, the cost of retaliatory tariffs and a pullback in household spending and business confidence.

The central bank said it will continue to monitor inflation expectations closely and how quickly costs incurred by businesses are being passed through to prices.

“The reality is that some prices are going to go up, we can't change that,” said Macklem. “What we don't want to see … that first round of price increases have knock-on effects causing other prices to go up, that becoming generalized and ongoing inflation. That's what we can't let happen.”

The bank said it will not be able to provide forward guidance given the uncertainty, a decision made during the last announcement in January. It also said the governing council will be “carefully assessing the timing and strength” of downward pressures on inflation from weaker growth and upward pressures on inflation from higher costs.

Randall Bartlett, deputy chief economist at Desjardins Group, said the market reaction following the announcement on Wednesday suggests an April cut is “no slam dunk.”

Tony Stillo and Michael Davenport, economists at Oxford Economics Canada, think the Bank of Canada could cut its policy rate a few more times this year, but will not go below the neutral range.

“We can't entirely rule out a couple more 25-basis-points rate cuts to cushion against the negative impacts of ongoing uncertainty, but we think it's very unlikely the bank will lower rates below the bottom-end of its 2.25 per cent-3.25 per cent neutral range estimate given the ongoing U.S.-Canada trade war,” they wrote in a note.

Greenland's pro-business opposition Demokraatit party won Tuesday's closely watched parliamentary election, beating the incumbent left-wing coalition in a vote dominated by U.S. President Donald Trump's pledge to take control of the island.

Demokraatit, which favours a slow approach to independence from Denmark, secured 29.9% of the votes with all ballots counted, up from 9.1% in 2021, ahead of the opposition Naleraq party, which favours rapid independence, at 24.5%.

Since taking office in January, Donald Trump has vowed to make Greenland - a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark – part of the United States, saying it is vital to U.S. security interests, an idea rejected by most Greenlanders.

The vast island, with a population of just 57,000, has been caught up in a geopolitical race for dominance in the Arctic, where melting ice caps are making its resources more accessible and opening new shipping routes. Both Russia and China have intensified military activity in the region.

""People want change ... We want more business to finance our welfare,"" said Jens-Frederik Nielsen, Demokraatit's leader and a former minister of industry and minerals. ""We don't want independence tomorrow, we want a good foundation,"" Nielsen told reporters in Nuuk.

He will now hold talks with other parties to try and form a governing coalition. The ruling Inuit Ataqatigiit party and its partner Siumut, which also seek a slow path towards independence, won a combined 36% of votes, down from 66.1% in 2021.

""We respect the election outcome,"" Prime Minister Mute Egede of the Inuit Ataqatigiit said in a Facebook post, adding that he would listen to any proposals in upcoming coalition talks. Greenland is a former Danish colony and has been a territory since 1953. It gained some autonomy in 1979 when its first parliament was formed, but Copenhagen still controls foreign affairs, defense and monetary policy and provides just under $1 billion a year to the economy.

In 2009, it won the right to declare full independence through a referendum, even though it has not done so out of concern living standards would drop without Denmark's economic support.

""I strongly believe that we will very soon start to live a life more based on who we are, based on our culture, based on our own language, and start to make regulations based on us, not based on Denmark,"" said Qupanuk Olsen, candidate for the main pro-independence party Naleraq.

Inge Olsvig Brandt, a candidate for the ruling Inuit Ataqatigiit party, said: ""We don't need the independence right now. We have too many things to work on. I think we have to work with ourselves, our history, and we are going to have a lot of healing work with us before we can take the next step.""

Voting had been extended by half an hour at some of the 72 polling stations across the Arctic island, where some 40,500 people were eligible to cast their ballot, although the final turnout was not immediately available.

Inuit pride

Trump's vocal interest has shaken up the status quo, and coupled with the growing pride of the Indigenous people in their Inuit culture, put independence front and center in the election.

In the final debate on Greenland's state broadcaster KNR late on Monday, leaders of the five parties currently in parliament unanimously said they did not trust Trump. ""He is trying to influence us. I can understand if citizens feel insecure,"" said Erik Jensen, leader of government coalition partner Siumut.

A January poll suggested a majority of Greenland's inhabitants support independence, but are divided on timing.

Early on, the election campaign focused on the anger and frustration aimed at historical wrongdoings by Denmark, according to Julie Rademacher, a consultant and former adviser to Greenland's government.

""But I think the fear of the U.S. imperialist approach has lately become bigger than the anger towards Denmark,"" said Rademacher.

Reuters spoke to more than a dozen Greenlanders in Nuuk, all of whom said they favored independence, although many expressed concern that a swift transition could damage the economy and eliminate Nordic welfare services like universal healthcare and free schooling.

""We don't want to be part of the U.S. for obvious reasons; healthcare and Trump,"" said Tuuta Lynge-Larsen, a bank employee and Nuuk resident, adding that this election was especially important. ""We don't like the attention, to put it short.""

The island holds substantial natural resources, including critical minerals such as rare earths used in high-tech industries, ranging from electric vehicles to missile systems. However, Greenland has been slow to extract them due to environmental concerns, severe weather, and China's near-total control of the sector, which has made it difficult for companies elsewhere to make a profit or secure buyers.

Investment pledges

Trump initially declined to rule out military force to take control of the territory, alarming many Greenlanders, although he later softened his stance, stating he would respect the will of the local people and was ""ready to invest billions of dollars"" if they joined the U.S.

Egede has stressed the island is not for sale and advocated for a broad coalition government to resist external pressure. In an interview aired on Monday by Danish broadcaster DR, he dismissed Trump's offer as disrespectful, expressing willingness to cooperate with other countries instead.

Denmark's prime minister has said Greenland is not for sale, but made it clear that it is up to the local people to decide their future. All six main political parties support independence but differ on how and when it could be achieved.

The pro-independence Naleraq party, the leading opposition force, gained momentum ahead of the election, bolstered by U.S. interest and fresh accusations of Denmark's historic exploitation of Greenland's mineral wealth.

The party believes the U.S. attention strengthens Greenland's position in secession talks with Denmark and aims to bring a deal with Copenhagen to a vote before the next election in four years.

      Lucknow-based SLMG Beverages Pvt. Ltd, a major Coca-Cola bottler in India, plans to invest up to $1 billion by 2030 to expand its production capacity in the populous states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, according to a company executive. The Ladhani family, which owns SLMG and also has hospitality interests, will also invest  ₹4,000 crore in hotel development.

      The outlay comes as the family—that first entered the bottling business back in 1997—plans to double its beverage business by the end of the decade. As the beverage company's bottler for Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, SLMG Beverages (part of the Ladhani Group) operates 11 bottling units, distributing its products to 1.5 million retail outlets.


     
      “We've already invested about $1.5 billion in the last 20 years in the bottling business (Coca-Cola). We will probably invest another $1 billion in the next five years. We are very, very confident of this business,"" Paritosh Ladhani, joint managing director, SLMG Beverages and second-generation entrepreneur, said in an interview with Mint in the capital on Wednesday.

      The company could touch  ₹10,000 crore in gross revenues by the end of the net fiscal. “It took us 20 years to reach  ₹10,000 crore; it will take us five years to double that number,"" Ladhani said.


     
      SLMG is Coca-Cola's largest independent bottler in India, contributing 23% to the beverage maker's national volumes. Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages Pvt. Ltd (HCCB), the company-owned bottling operation, is still the largest bottler.

      The Atlanta-based beverage company works with local bottling partners worldwide, who manufacture and distribute its beverages in select markets or territories. It sells brands such as Thums-Up, Sprite, Coca-Cola and Minute Maid in India. 


     
      Since 2019, Coca-Cola India, through its subsidiaries, has been divesting its bottling operations in the country—a process it said would help it streamline supply chains and help with faster execution.


     
      In 2024, SLMG was given rights for the entire Bihar territory in addition to its existing presence in Uttar Pradesh.


     
      SLMG has a pipeline of new bottling plants in both Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.


     
      “We have started a plant in Buxar, Bihar, with an investment of  ₹1,200 crore. Then we are getting into Bijnor (Uttar Pradesh) in a couple of years, which will take care of west UP, we have another plant coming up in Bihar, probably in Hajipur. The expansion will be a mix of brownfield and greenfield projects,"" he added.


     
      Increased electrification, improved highway connectivity, and greater household refrigerator penetration have helped Coca-Cola and PepsiCo expand their beverage businesses in India. 


     
      India is the beverage maker's fifth largest market globally. 


     
      Last month, Kandhari Global Beverages Pvt. Ltd, another Coca-Cola India bottler, announced its largest acquisition to date: a new plant from Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages Pvt. Ltd (HCCB) in Sanand, Gujarat. The company plans to expand in overseas markets and list its shares on stock exchanges if and when its US partner decides the time is right.

The Bank of Canada has cut its overnight lending rate by 25 basis points to 2.75 per cent, it announced on Wednesday, as an ongoing trade war with the U.S. begins to strain the Canadian economy.

Explaining the decision in his opening remarks, Bank of Canada governor Tiff Macklem said the economy started the year strong, with solid GDP growth and inflation within its two per cent target.

But tariff uncertainty caused by the on-again, off-again trade war between Canada and the U.S. has weighed on business spending and hiring, and shaken consumer confidence, he said. Manufacturing businesses in particular have lowered their sales outlooks.

It's ""against this backdrop"" that the central bank decided to cut the rate by a quarter point, according to Macklem, though he added that a surge in exports ahead of the tariffs might offset a slowdown in growth.

""While it is still too early to see much impact of new tariffs on economic activity, our surveys suggest that threats of new tariffs and uncertainty about the Canada-U.S. trade relationship are already having a big impact on business and consumer intentions,"" he said during his Wednesday news conference.

Bank of Canada cuts key rate, cites 'pervasive uncertainty' of U.S. tariff threats

It's the seventh consecutive cut the Bank has made since it started bringing rates down in June 2024.

""They're clearly worried that an economy that was otherwise in pretty good shape and wouldn't have needed a rate cut now needs this one, and perhaps more, given the potential shock from higher tariffs and what that's going to do to the Canadian economy in the near term,"" said Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC.

The bank's internal research shows that Canadian businesses intend to raise prices to offset the impact of tariffs. As Macklem noted, less spending by businesses and consumers tends to put downward pressure on inflation. But rising costs could trigger it.

""We're now facing a new crisis. Depending on the extent and duration of new U.S. tariffs, the economic impact could be severe. The uncertainty alone is already causing harm,"" he said on Wednesday.

Macklem has warned in the past that the bank cannot shield the Canadian economy from the financial impact of tariffs, but that it can instead use interest rates to manage a potential surge in inflation.

Tiff Macklem outlines what tariffs could mean for inflation in Canada

Meanwhile, the bank's preferred measures of core inflation are still above two per cent, mainly driven by housing-related price growth, adding to its concerns.

Asked what kind of inflationary impacts Canada faces, Macklem said during the Q&A with reporters that ""given the pervasive uncertainty and unpredictability of U.S. trade policy, I can't put a number on it.""

Several factors could contribute to inflation, he said. The weak Canadian dollar poses a challenge to importers, because it means the products they bring in will be more expensive; retaliatory tariffs imposed by Canada will also add costs; and uncertainty itself adds costs, because businesses are looking for new suppliers and new markets to sustain themselves.

""Somebody has to pay for these costs and, ultimately, they get passed to the consumer,"" he explained. ""What we can do is ensure that any rise in inflation is temporary."" 

As one reporter pointed out, Macklem never used the word recession in his remarks, which some economists have said is a likely outcome given that tariffs will hamper growth.

As for whether a recession is imminent, deputy governor Carolyn Rogers said the bank doesn't have a forecast at this point. ""All of those things don't bode well for growth, but we'll see,"" she said.

The Bank of Canada's next interest rate meeting is on April 16, at which point it will also release its quarterly monetary policy report to assess the outlook for the Canadian economy.

BMO chief economist Douglas Porter wrote in a note to clients that any future interest rate decisions ""will be largely guided by the direction of travel in the trade war, although we suspect the Bank was headed a bit lower in any event.""

""Our core assumption is that Canada will be facing some serious tariffs for an extended period of time and that the growth dampening aspects of the trade war will ultimately outweigh the upside inflationary impact, keeping the Bank in easing mode,"" Porter wrote.

He expects the Bank will make a 25 basis point cut at each of its next three meetings, bringing the overnight lending rate to two per cent.

                Protestors gathered outside the Department of Veterans Affairs headquarters in Washington, DC, US, on Feb. 13, 2025. The agency plans to cut 80,000 jobs.

In the wake of federal firings and executive orders, providers and patients at the Department of Veterans Affairs say mental health and mental health care are suffering.

They fear this struggle will get worse as the VA carries through with 80,000 promised job cuts. The agency is one of the largest providers of mental health care in the country.

""I've been really struggling with my concentration and my ability to focus when I'm at work, because I feel like I have this ax over my head all the time,"" says a mental health provider who asked NPR not to disclose the location of her work and to identify her only as Lynn, her middle name, for fear she could be fired for speaking out. 

Lynn is especially concerned about her clients who identify as LGBTQ, since one executive order called on federal employees to eliminate ""equity related,"" grants or contracts and another directed them to recognize only two sexes.

Consequently employees at the VA have been directed to remove symbols such as flags that indicate support for transgender or queer rights. ""We're kind of skirting around that,"" says Lynn. ""Some people have put up art in their office that says 'Love is love,' or a rainbow. So we're all kind of being subversive.""

Therapists in other locations reported similar concern that these patients — already in a marginalized population — are being singled out and targeted for discrimination. They employed strategies similar to Lynn's to silently communicate a message of solidarity to patients who identify as LGBTQ.

These rebellions come with a price.

""If I wear this stuff, am I then gonna become a target from either my patients or maybe my peers?"" asks Lynn. ""Because there's this culture of, 'you need to rat on people.'""

Employees at the VA have received emails encouraging them to report colleagues who are violating the new ban on diversity, equity and inclusion. There have also been high profile firings in the military of leaders who are Black or female.

Lynn says these changes are destabilizing to patients as well. "" We've had patients going to the medical records and asking for their charts to be altered,"" she says, ""to remove references to their gender identity or their sexual orientation because they're fearing that they might be put on a list or that they might be discriminated against.""

Some patients who have post-traumatic stress disorder say the changes are especially disconcerting. One woman, who asked to be identified only as D.M., says she's been suffering from near-constant anxiety since the changes began at the VA. She served for 26 years on active duty as a nurse and was sexually assaulted by a fellow service member. She says since then, she's strictly avoided being alone in rooms with men.

""Even if you have to grab the office secretary, you make sure you are not one-on-one with that male, and that's to protect you and to protect him,"" says D.M.

Receiving both mental and physical health care at an all-women's clinic, she says, has been tremendously helpful. D.M. fears such spaces will be eliminated from veteran and army life."" We're gonna get rid of anything that involves women, transgender, you know, all that stuff,"" she says.

The VA has not announced plans to cut such clinics, and the stated purpose of the executive order D.M. references on gender is to ""protect women."" In an emailed statement from the VA, spokesperson Peter Kasperowicz wrote, ""The VA will always provide veterans, families, caregivers and survivors the health care and benefits they have earned.""

Doug Collins, secretary of Veterans Affairs, has promised to preserve ""mission critical"" positions such as clinicians.

But some VA employees and veterans' advocates warn that getting rid of any staff could compromise care in a system that is predicated on an integrated model of physical and mental health, including research positions.

""Having high quality research is a part of high quality care,"" says Rashi Romanoff, CEO of a non-profit, The National Association of Veterans' Research and Education Foundations (NAVREF). The group does advocacy for research for veterans and warns that $35 million worth of research that is underway could be lost if the VA does not indefinitely preserve between 350 and 400 clinical trials.

In an emailed statement to NPR, VA spokesperson Kasperowicz said the agency would continue to fund these programs for 90 days ""while the department conducts a comprehensive assessment of ongoing research."" Trials include research on topics such as suicide mitigation and treatment for substance use disorder, according to NAVREF's data collection.

Nurse practitioner Lynn says going to work everyday feels like she's working on the Titanic. ""Half the people on the boat are still in the ballroom partying and 25 percent of them are actively telling me I'm hysterical,"" she says.

She plans to stay aboard until she has no choice but to save herself.

Cutting Medicaid funding and halting the program's expansion would result in providers revenues decreasing by about $80 billion, and uncompensated care on behalf of uninsured people would increase by $18.9 billion in 2026 due to declines in health insurance coverage, finds a report from the Urban Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Among all provider types, hospitals would face the largest revenue losses ($31.9 billion) and burden of uncompensated care increases ($6.3 billion).

About 10.8 million more people would become uninsured if all states were to drop the Medicaid expansion, with the number of uninsured increasing by 50% or more in half of expansion states, data showed.

""With significant cuts to the Medicaid program potentially on the horizon, it is important that federal, state and local policymakers and stakeholders consider potential adverse effects on healthcare coverage, access, and affordability, and the financial vulnerability of certain providers,"" authors wrote.

WHAT'S THE IMPACT

Currently, the federal government pays 90% of costs for Medicaid enrollees who are eligible under the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion in all 41 states that chose to expand eligibility (including Washington D.C.). 

But House GOP leadership has proposed substantial cuts in federal funding to Medicaid over the next 10 years, potentially including per capita caps, work requirements and a reduction of the 90% match rate (known as the enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, or FMAP) for the ACA expansion population to each state's general matching rate, which varies by state from 50 to 74%.

The study cited evidence that Medicaid expansion contributed to significant gains in health insurance coverage, and improvements in access to care and low-income families' health and financial well-being, and has had a positive impact on hospitals' and other providers' financial health. That, authors said, is due to declines in providers' uncompensated care burdens – that is, reductions in unreimbursed expenses attributable to uninsured patients and increases in revenue from newly covered patients.

The declines in provider revenue resulting from the GOP's proposed cuts are around four times larger than the estimated losses that providers would face if enhanced ACA tax credits were to expire, numbers showed. 

Because lower spending on healthcare services means lower revenue for providers and fewer services rendered, the resulting decline in revenue could have adverse consequences, particularly for hospitals that are already financially at risk, authors said.

Losses in revenue from states dropping the Medicaid expansion could put more hospitals at risk and potentially lead to large increases in rural hospital closures, the report found. In addition to having negative spillover effects on the local economy, hospital closures could reduce access to and use of hospital services, increasing the mortality risk for heart attacks, unintentional injuries and time-sensitive conditions.

THE LARGER TREND

This week the Congressional Budget Office projected that the GOP's proposed $880 billion in spending cuts would not be possible without slashing Medicaid.

CBO's baseline budget projections show mandatory outlays for Medicaid, Medicare and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) will total $8.8 trillion between 2025 and 2034. Medicaid accounts for 93% of the total, at $8.2 trillion.

Medicaid expansion enrollment increased last year due to seven states implementing expansion in 2020 or later, as well as adoption of the continuous enrollment provision, a pandemic-era policy that prohibited states from disenrolling people from Medicaid in exchange for enhanced federal funding, a January KFF study found.

Even with the unwinding of the continuous enrollment provision starting April 1, 2023, enrollment in Medicaid expansion today is higher than it was in 2020, KFF found. The number of marketplace enrollees increased by 10 million people nationally, almost doubling between 2020 and 2024, and the number of Medicaid expansion enrollees increased by 6.2 million people.

Lowering the Medicaid expansion match rate from the current 90% rate would shift costs to states and likely result in decisions by many states to terminate coverage, according to KFF. About 4.3 million Medicaid expansion enrollees live in states with some type of trigger law that would end Medicaid expansion or require review of expansion coverage to mitigate increases in state costs if federal funding for the expansion is reduced.

Except for Florida, the states with the largest ACA enrollment as a share of population had adopted the Medicaid expansion. The five states with the lowest share of enrollment were Medicaid non-expansion states.

The prospect of deep cuts to Medicaid, the United States government programme to provide healthcare to low-income people, has become a flashpoint in Congress as leaders of both parties accuse their counterparts of lying.

Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic Party leader in the House of Representatives, said on February 27 that a Republican budget measure would “set in motion the largest cut to Medicaid in American history” and Republicans are hiding the consequences.

“The Republicans are lying to the American people about Medicaid,” Jeffries said. “I can't say it any other way. Republicans are lying. Prove me wrong.”

Republicans said Democrats were distorting the Republican budget. Congressman Steve Scalise said: “The word Medicaid is not even in this bill.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson said on CNN that Republicans don't want to cut Medicaid “and the Democrats have been lying about it.”

Republicans are looking for massive budget savings to meet their goal of fully extending President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts. This is a separate process from Congress's need to pass a continuing resolution to keep the government running by Friday or else face a federal government shutdown.

Here's what we know so far about potential Medicaid cuts.

Medicaid serves about one in five Americans. The healthcare programme is paid for by the federal government and partly by states. Louisiana, home to Johnson and Scalise, has one of the highest state proportions of Medicaid enrollees.

The House Republican budget plan adopted on February 25 opens the door to slashing Medicaid even though it doesn't name the programme.

The plan directs the House Energy and Commerce Committee to find ways to cut the deficit by at least $880bn over the next decade.

The committee has jurisdiction over Medicaid, Medicare and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in addition to much smaller programmes. CHIP offers low-cost health coverage to children in families that earn too much money to qualify for Medicaid.

Republicans ruled out cuts to Medicare, the health insurance programme for senior citizens, which leaders cut at their political peril. Medicare is about 15 percent of the federal budget, and Medicaid is about 8.6 percent.

When Medicare is set aside, Medicaid accounts for 93 percent of the funding under the committee's jurisdiction, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found in a March 5 analysis. That means it is impossible for the committee to find enough cuts that don't affect Medicaid.

“It's a fantasy to imply that federal Medicaid assistance won't be cut very deeply,” said Allison Orris, an expert on Medicaid policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank.

After Medicaid, the next largest programme under the committee's jurisdiction is CHIP. Lawmakers don't appear to be planning to wipe out CHIP, but even if they did, they would be only a “fraction of the way there”, said Joan Alker, an expert on Medicaid and CHIP at Georgetown University in Washington, DC.

If Medicare cuts are off the table, the only way to achieve $880bn in savings is through big Medicaid cuts, said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, a health policy organisation.

Andy Schneider, a professor at Georgetown who served in former President Barack Obama's administration as a senior adviser at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said even if the committee eliminated all other programmes entirely, it could achieve only $381bn in savings – about 43 percent of the target.

“In short, if they don't want to cut Medicaid [or CHIP], and they don't want to cut Medicare, the goal of cutting $880bn is impossible,” Schneider said.

The $880bn cut is not a done deal. House Republicans were able to pass their budget package, but Senate Republicans are taking a different approach and haven't proposed such significant cuts.

Any finalised budget blueprint would need Senate Republicans' buy-in. Senator Josh Hawley is among Republicans who have spoken against potential cuts. He told the HuffPost: “I would not do severe cuts to Medicaid.”

The numbers are starting points that may lead to negotiation among at least Republicans, Joe Antos, a healthcare expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said. “We are a long way from final legislation, so it's not possible to predict how much any programme will be cut,” he said.

“If the bill also includes extending the [Trump 2017] tax cuts, we are probably months away from seeing real language,” Antos said.

Once the House and Senate reach an agreement on language and the resolution passes both chambers, the committees would work on detailed cuts. To enact such cuts, both chambers would need to approve a separate bill and receive Trump's signature.

Republican leaders have deflected concerns about Medicaid cuts by talking about a different target: Medicaid fraud.

“I'm not going to touch Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. Now, we're going to get fraud out of there,” Trump said in an interview on the Fox News channel on Sunday in keeping with his campaign rhetoric that he would protect those programmes.

At the same time, Trump praised the House resolution that would make cuts highly likely: “The House Resolution implements my FULL America First Agenda, EVERYTHING, not just parts of it!” he said in a social media post.

Would eliminating fraud solve the Medicaid problem? No.

On CNN, Johnson said cutting fraud, waste and abuse would result in “part of the savings to accomplish this mission”. He said the government loses $50bn a year in Medicaid payments “just in fraud alone”.

But Johnson conflated “fraud” with “improper payments”. The Government Accountability Office, the nonpartisan investigative arm that examines the use of public funds, found about $50bn in improper payments in Medicaid and the same amount in Medicare in 2023.

Those improper payments were made in an incorrect amount (overpayment or underpayment), should not have been made at all, or had missing or insufficient documentation. But that doesn't mean there was $50bn in Medicaid fraud, which would involve obtaining something through wilful misrepresentation.

The system used to identify improper payments is not designed to measure fraud, so we don't know what percentage of improper payments were losses due to fraud, Schneider said.

Plus, it's a drop in the overall bucket of the potential $880bn in cuts.

If states end their expansion programs, spending on healthcare services would fall by nearly $80 billion and uncompensated care costs would rise by nearly $19 billion in 2026.

Congressional Republicans are debating slashing funds for Medicaid to pay for President Donald Trump's promised tax cuts, as well as increased spending on defense and border security.

Last month, House Republicans advanced a budget blueprint that directs the Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicare and Medicaid, to find $880 in spending cuts.

The budget resolution doesn't specifically mention Medicaid. But Republicans are unlikely to meet their budget targets without slashing the safety-net insurance, which covers almost 80 million Americans along with the Children's Health Insurance Program, according to a letter sent to lawmakers from the Congressional Budget Office last week. 

One potential way to lower Medicaid spending is reducing the amount of money the federal government provides states to cover the cost of expanding the program to more beneficiaries. 

Under the Affordable Care Act, the government pays 90% of the expenses for enrollees who are eligible for Medicaid under expansion — typically working people who can't afford or aren't offered coverage through their jobs, according to the report. 

Slashing those funds would put significant pressure on their budgets, the Urban Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation said in a previous analysis. If all states that have expanded Medicaid drop their programs, the number of uninsured, non-elderly adults would increase by nearly 11 million.

The healthcare sector would also likely see reduced revenue, as uninsured people seek out less medical care. Nearly $21 billion less would be spent on prescription drugs, while services provided by office-based physicians would decline by $6.4 billion, according to the report. Other healthcare services, like home healthcare or dental care, would also fall by nearly $21 billion.

“A funding reduction of this magnitude would not only cause a massive coverage loss but would also be financially devastating for hospitals and other healthcare providers,” Katherine Hempstead, senior policy adviser at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, said in a statement. “Hospitals are major employers and are often the economic bedrock of their communities. These cuts would have major ripple effects on local economies, especially in rural areas.”

Providers would also take a financial hit from an increased burden of services that aren't reimbursed. Uncompensated care would increase by $2.2 billion for physician practices and $6.6 billion for other healthcare services, as well as a $3.8 billion bump in uncompensated spending on prescription drugs.

More than half of the increase in uncompensated care will be financed by providers themselves, according to the analysis. Thirty percent would come from the federal government, while 19% would be financed by state and local governments.

The Texas-based home-based care provider New Day Healthcare has acquired the home health agency Patient Recovery Home Healthcare Services in Houston. Financial terms were undisclosed.

The transaction marks New Day's 14th successful acquisition to date and comes approximately one month after it acquired Christian Senior Care, also in Houston. Patient Recovery Home Healthcare has been in operation for 15 years and will not rebrand post-acquisition. The company's current staff will remain in place, according to New Day.

“New Day is pleased to welcome Patient Recovery Home Healthcare to our expanding home care platform,” said Matthew Griffith, chief development and strategy officer for New Day, in a statement. “Patient Recovery Home Healthcare, along with Christian Senior Care Services which we acquired earlier this year, provide New Day with needed density, brand recognition and talent to grow in an ultra-competitive Houston market.”

New Day now provides the full continuum of its home care services to patients in the Houston area and views the market as critical to its long-term growth strategy, the company indicated in a press release. It is pursuing additional growth in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, San Antonio and Austin, Texas.

Similar to national demographic trends, a growing aging population is driving demand for hospice in Texas. Seniors 65 and older represent 13.8% of the Lone Star State's overall population, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Hospice utilization among Medicare decedents 52.23% in Texas in 2022, reported the National Alliance for Care at Home. Hospice utilization rates hovered at 49.1% nationwide that year.

New Day Healthcare provides hospice, home heath, pediatrics, clinical decision support and personal care to more than 150,000 patients annually from 33 locations across Texas, Missouri, Kansas and Illinois. 

“New Day's value creation model is based on providing the continuum of services while leveraging our proprietary CareLytics software to best monitor patients and to fill care gaps,” said Griffith. “The Houston metro area, along with Dallas-Fort Worth, San Antonio and Austin, provide the needed density and growth potential to align our clinical care models and improve patient outcomes.”

What subsector of health tech, medtech or biotech is your firm allocating more investment in 2025 and what's an area you are moving away from? Why?

The four pillars of our investment thesis include medtech, healthtech, life science tools and diagnostics, and pharma adjacent technologies. Our current portfolio weighs more towards medical devices. We aren't moving away from our core thesis, but we are taking a fresh look at tech-enabled services and healthcare IT, spaces that we have historically found success in, but have been such dynamic ecosystems. I'm excited about the potential opportunities that will emerge in the next couple of years.

Have you seen any shifts in the way startups seek investment in the past couple of years? 

I think the fundraising environment has been very tough, and financing risk has increased. I think startups have adapted by becoming increasingly capital efficient and are giving extra scrutiny in defining value-driving milestones in anticipation of future funding needs.

Have you seen a shift in healthcare or biopharma strategic investor priorities in recent years?

I think uncertainties in the macro environment may drive priorities to more de-risked investments with more predictable business models, and investments that are more immediately accretive.

What is an example of a portfolio company's work you are particularly proud of?

I am very proud of the team at SonarMD and what they've achieved. Last year was an important year, and the team worked through some tough commercial headwinds and strategic questions that put the company on track to further growth and helping more GI patients manage their symptoms and care. The value-based care world is not easy to navigate!

The exact funding picture remains unclear, but experts say that the US's immediate freeze has already affected health services worldwide. Image: REUTERS/Kent Nishimura

Over 80% of USAID funding is to be cancelled and the remaining programmes administered by the State Department, Reuters reports.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on 10 March that, following a six-week review by the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, significant changes have been made to US foreign aid.

And it's not just the US, other countries are reducing their foreign aid allocation, including some of Europe's largest global health funders, reports EuroNews.

So what does this mean for health? The exact funding picture remains unclear, but experts say that the US's immediate freeze in January on all foreign aid has already impacted health services worldwide, including major United Nations (UN) programmes like UNAIDS.

With artificial intelligence transforming healthcare, the World Health Organization (WHO) has named the Netherlands' Digital Ethics Centre at Delft University of Technology as a WHO Collaborating Centre on AI for health governance. 

The designation aims to strengthen global efforts in ensuring AI is used responsibly, safely and equitably in health systems.

As a leader in ethical AI research, the Centre will support global AI policy, advise the WHO and lead training initiatives.

AI in health faces multiple challenges, notes a recent Forum white paper, particularly the sensitive nature of health data and its protection, which can create a risk-averse environment that hampers technological development. The Future of AI-Enabled Health outlines six key governance priorities:

“WHO is committed to helping Member States plan, govern and adopt responsible AI technologies,” said Dr Alain Labrique, WHO's Director of Digital Health and Innovation. 

“To ensure these benefits reach everyone ethically, safely, and equitably, we rely on strong technical and academic partnerships that guide us in this rapidly evolving field.”

A WHO staff memo reveals new cost-cutting measures following the US decision to withdraw from the body, according to ABC. The agency is seeking alternative funding but has not confirmed success, the Australian news outlet says.

Africa's health system is at risk of collapse due to rising chronic diseases like cancer and diabetes, according to Dr Githinji Gitahi, CEO of Amref Health Africa. While foreign aid has focused on infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have escalated and now account for 37% of deaths in sub-Saharan Africa, he told The Guardian. NCDs are expected to be the leading cause of death by 2030, driven by unhealthy diets and pollution.

Obesity rates in Africa are also rising, with nearly half of women expected to be overweight or obese by 2030, a recent study says. Access to weight loss treatments and care for related diseases like diabetes and heart disease remains limited, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.

Lab-grown meat, dairy, and sugar could be available in the UK within two years as the Food Standards Agency fast-tracks approval, reports the BBC. UK firms face delays due to regulations, while Singapore, the US, and Israel have already approved lab-grown meat.

Haemorrhage and hypertensive disorders like preeclampsia are the leading causes of maternal deaths globally, responsible for 80,000 and 50,000 fatalities in 2020, according to a new WHO study. Published in the Lancet Global Health, it also highlights that conditions including HIV/AIDS, malaria and diabetes contribute to 23% of maternal deaths, often going undetected until complications arise.

Pharma companies are calling for increased investment in non-communicable disease prevention and treatment, as new research shows that spending 1% more of GDP on healthcare could save 5 million lives annually in low- and middle-income countries.

What is the World Economic Forum doing to improve healthcare systems? 

The Global Health and Strategic Outlook 2023 highlighted that there will be an estimated shortage of 10 million healthcare workers worldwide by 2030. 

The World Economic Forum's Centre for Health and Healthcare works with governments and businesses to build more resilient, efficient and equitable healthcare systems that embrace new technologies.

Noncommunicable diseases are responsible for 80% of deaths in low- and middle-income countries, but digital health technologies offer a powerful solution. By improving care and cutting costs, these innovations can bridge geographic and economic gaps – if governments and the private sector collaborate effectively for lasting change.

When women have access to quality healthcare, they can thrive in education, the workforce and their communities. Despite progress, barriers like limited access to timely screenings and accurate diagnostics remain. As we mark 30 years since the Beijing Declaration, experts stress the need to prioritize accessible, high-quality diagnostics to achieve global gender and health equity goals.

Author(s):

Flood exposure was more strongly associated with increased health care use and cost during the summer months and among Medicare beneficiaries aged 85 or older.

Flood exposure was associated with increased health care use and costs among Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 or older, emphasizing the need for targeted public health strategies and improved disaster preparedness.1



The authors of the JAMA Network Open study explained that extreme precipitation events have become more frequent and intense over the past century and are expected to increase further due to climate change. They noted that flooding impacts health in various ways, including drowning, electrical injuries, and hypothermia. Additionally, flooding-related infrastructure damage can disrupt health services, displace individuals, and create broader societal challenges.



Older adults may be particularly vulnerable to flooding-related health effects due to preexisting health conditions and mobility limitations, which can hinder their ability to respond to flood warnings or evacuations. This vulnerability is not unique to flooding, as most of the residents confirmed to have died during the California wildfires in January were either aged 65 or older or had a physical disability, underscoring the challenges of evacuation for these populations.2



Floods rank among the costliest disasters in the US, with many causing more than $1 billion in damages.1 Despite this, the researchers highlighted a lack of understanding regarding the effects of flooding on health care utilization and associated costs, which limits health impact assessments, risk communication, climate change-related damage estimation, and future projections of climate change health impacts.

To address these gaps, they analyzed the relationship between large-scale flood events and health care use among Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 or older residing in zip code tabulation areas (ZCTAs) affected by such events between 2008 and 2017. More specifically, they examined the incidence of emergency department (ED) visits and hospital admissions during flooding events and assessed the associated health care costs.



The primary exposure variable was the presence of a flood, as recorded in the Multisourced Flood Inventories, a spatially distributed flood database. Also, the primary outcomes measured included incident rate ratios (IRRs) with corresponding 95% CIs.



To quantify the impact, the researchers calculated attributable risk percentages and estimated the number of related excess visits. Additionally, they conducted stratified analyses to assess potential effect modification. As for health care costs, the researchers standardized all estimates to 2017 US dollars to ensure comparability.



The study population contained 11,801,527 Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 or older, with a mean (SD) age of 74.4 (7.6) years. Most beneficiaries were female (56.3%) and White (88.3%). From 2008 through 2017, the researchers determined that 16,536 of 33,140 ZCTAs flooded. The median number of floods experienced in each ZCTA was 1 (IQR, 1-2), and the median flood duration was 10 (IQR, 4-30) days.



The mean (SD) ZCTA flood exposure per beneficiary was 1.3 (0.6). Also, the median area flooded was 34,769 (IQR, 17,319-65,584) square miles, and the median number of Medicare beneficiaries per flooded ZCTA was 4142 (IQR, 2006-7536).



The rate of all-cause ED visits and hospitalizations increased by 4.8% (IRR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.04-1.05) and 7.4% (IRR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.07-1.08), respectively, after flood exposure. The researchers observed the largest IRR increases for ED visits among beneficiaries with metabolic and kidney conditions (IRR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.06-1.11) and injuries (IRR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.04-1.06). Similarly, they observed the greatest IRR increases for all-cause hospitalizations among beneficiaries with infectious disease (IRR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.10-1.13) and metabolic and kidney conditions (IRR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.07-1.12).



Additionally, stratified analyses determined that the IRRs increased with age, from 4.9% greater hospitalizations among adults aged 65 to 74 (IRR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.04-1.06) to 7.3% higher among those aged 75 to 84 (IRR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.06-1.08) and 12.4% greater among those aged 85 or older (IRR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.11-1.1). They also found increased IRRs for ED visits (IRR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.06-1.10) and hospitalizations (IRR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.10-1.13) in the summer months.



Lastly, the mean ZCTA-level cost was $3230 (95% CI, $3198-$32,610) per ED visit and $11,310 (95% CI, $11,252-$11,367) for all-cause hospitalizations. Consequently, the national costs to the Medicare system for ED visits and hospitalizations were estimated to be $69,275,429 (95% CI, $63,010,840-$76,315,210) and $191,409,579 (95% CI, $172,782,870-$206,181,300), respectively.



The researchers acknowledged their study's limitations, including the health care cost estimations using claims data from the Medicare dataset; this approach may not capture the total health care costs resulting from flood exposure. Despite their limitations, they expressed confidence in their findings and suggested areas for further research.



“Although our findings provided valuable insights to the understanding of flood-related health impacts, they also highlighted the need for ongoing research in this area, especially in the context of an aging population and a changing climate,” the authors concluded. “Future studies should aim to incorporate more detailed environmental and individual-level data to further refine our understanding of the complex interplay between flood events and population health.”

Michael Allen, senior clinical informatics nurse at Indiana University Health, presented at HIMSS25.

LAS VEGAS – Because simulated escape rooms have shown success when used for clinical training, Michael Allen, senior clinical informatics nurse at Indiana University Health, thought they might also help new nurse graduates game out how they would perform during electronic health record outages.

His hunch was correct. New nurses who participated in his escape room study felt more confident in performing certain critical tasks during EHR downtime, said Allen during his session at HIMSS25 this past week.

After hospitals and health systems nationwide began to roll out electronic health records, many aspects of patient safety improved. 

""When it goes down, however, there's a harm risk,"" Allen said.

Technologies such as smart rooms, which have been shown to improve care coordination among patients, families and providers, are also designed to make shrinking clinical workforces more efficient.

""As many nurses leave the workforce, it has become pivotal for hospitals to embrace technology that modernizes the care environment and offers a more enriching workplace for clinicians and staff,"" Jeff Fallon, chairman and CEO of Vibe Health by eVideon, told Healthcare IT News in December.

When greener nurses are faced with downtime procedures caused by outages, cyberattacks and other events, they are vulnerable to missteps – for example, checking patient armbands, said Allen.

""Schools aren't teaching how to document on paper anymore, neither are hospitals nor healthcare systems,"" he said. ""As a result, these new graduates aren't prepared for when the [EHR] goes down. We've all seen it.""

Experience that new graduates have in their first few years of nursing ""is not the same that we have,"" he said to a room full of nurse leaders attending the global conference. 

""They don't have old nurses anymore. Those old nurses quit during the COVID [pandemic],"" Allen said.

During system outages of less than 12 hours, patient documentation will be left to the end of their shift, he said.

""They're just going to backcharge the whole thing.""

Where studies have shown that traditional training methodologies have been less effective in downtime training, Allen said he gathered 28 participants with less than two years of experience at Ball Memorial Hospital for escape room-style training. 

Allen applied Kolb's experiential learning theory to design the challenges for the engaging, interactive and hands-on escape room method, which has already proven effective for mixed groups of nurses.

""This is an adult learning theory, and basically, it takes career and position, and it uses this to merge concrete experience and abstract conceptualization with reflective observation and active experimentation,"" Allen said.

""The escape from training worked.""

By applying what they know to an experience in the escape room, new nursing graduates find out what doesn't work and get support from the proctor.

""We can coach them on it, and then they can re-reason what we've taught them and go back through, come up with a new formula, and find out what works,"" Allen said.

The briefing at the beginning of the training simulation gave the nurse participants the basics of the escape room and charting documentation, and at the end, each was debriefed. 

""The reason is this is not about creating an obstacle to overcome, but rather, it's an educational purpose,"" he said.

Tasks in the escape room, which accommodated five nurses at a time, included finding policies and policy tech, ""because our policy tech still works with a network outage,"" Allen said. 

The nurses had to find the forms, take a phone order, fax an order and write in medication – five tasks in total. 

After completing the study, Allen said he now suggests that escape room training for new nurses focus on three things that can be covered in-depth in a short amount of time.

""You want this to be a little bit challenging, so it's fun. Because if you achieve something, then you get that little dopamine reward,"" he said.

Allen suggests conducting the training twice per year and keeping follow-up participant surveys to five or fewer questions.

Resident and intern physicians at Hennepin Healthcare filed for union recognition on Wednesday in hopes of improving pay and working conditions for professionals getting their start in the medical field.

A supermajority of more than 200 residents and interns voted in favor of securing collective bargaining rights with the Committee of Interns and Residents, an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union with more than 37,000 members nationwide. 

The doctors say they work up to 80 hours per week for what “amounts to as little as minimum wage per hour,” according to a news release from CIR/SEIU. 

“[H]ospital administration basically uses residents to plug holes in an understaffed system,” Dr. Abishek Thatigutla said. “It's simply not sustainable to keep pushing ourselves this much, and we're unionizing not only to address our conditions but hopefully to improve the system itself.” 

In addition to dissatisfaction with hours and wages, union members specifically cited difficulty for staff who are pregnant or have children.

“One thing that has motivated me to want to unionize and ensure we have a collective voice is that there just isn't a whole lot of support for parents, and especially for pregnant physicians,” one CIR/SEIU member, Dr. Nicole Lund, said. “I want to leave this place better than I found it, and part of that is bringing in a more diverse resident body, which includes women and women having children.”

They've asked Hennepin Healthcare to voluntarily recognize their union.

KARE 11 News at Noon

MINNEAPOLIS — About 200 resident physicians at Hennepin Healthcare filed for union recognition on Wednesday, according to the Committee of Interns and Residents (CIR/SEIU).

The physicians request that Hennepin Healthcare voluntarily recognize their union and begin negotiations. CIR/SEIU shared that physicians are looking to negotiate on understaffing, payment, and working hours, among other topics. 

“We came to Hennepin specifically because we wanted to work in a safety net hospital caring for this community, and so all of the residents care so deeply and dive headfirst into our work,” Dr. Nicole Lund said in the press release. “But we are stretched so thin, and the truth is, it doesn't have to be this way.” 

CIR/SEIU shared that doctors are exhausted and experiencing financial stress. In the press release, resident physicians said they work with many patients with high barriers to accessing care, including lack of insurance, working class patients, patients of color, immigrants and Native American patients. 

“If you're treating patients who don't have access to the health care we all need, it's that much more important to be able to give 100% when you're with each and every person,” said Dr. Abishek Thatigutla. “But hospital administration basically uses residents to plug holes in an understaffed system. It's simply not sustainable to keep pushing ourselves this much, and we're unionizing not only to address our conditions, but hopefully to improve the system itself.” 

In the press release, CIR shared that it has more than doubled in size as physicians have sought to unionize since the pandemic began in 2020.

Landmark, which operates six hospitals across three states, will kick off a marketing process for its facilities in the coming weeks as it seeks new capital providers or owners.

Landmark, which operates hospitals in Missouri, Georgia and Florida, opened its first facility in Missouri in 2006. Since that time, the provider has grown to operate five long-term acute care facilities and manage a sixth, with hospitals in Athens, Georgia; Savannah, Georgia; Cape Girardeau, Missouri; Columbia, Missouri; Joplin, Missouri; and Lehigh Acres, Florida.

Landmark had grown its revenue prior to declaring bankruptcy. For the year ending Dec. 31, 2023, Landmark increased revenue by more than $7 million compared to 2022 to total $79.4 million, the system said in first day filings.

However, expenses also climbed. Contract labor costs in particular exploded, rising 229% since 2020, while salaries, wages and benefits for skilled nurses grew by about 29%. 

The system said pharmaceutical costs have also started to climb between 2022 and 2024. 

“The combination of these factors has strained Landmark's ability to generate cash flow sufficient to service its outstanding debt obligation,” the system said.

Landmark imposed numerous cost cutting initiatives in an attempt to stave off a bankruptcy filing, including layoffs at its business office in Cape Girardeau, trimming the number of human resource professionals and accountants in Florida, and closing a Florida office. It also outsourced hospital billing and collections.

However, Landmark's efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. The provider reported approximately $70 million in assets at the time of filing and $86 million in liabilities.

Landmark's debts include a $30 million loan to Amerant Bank and approximately $13 million in outstanding lease payments to two real estate investment trusts which own the underlying real estate for its hospital portfolio.

The provider said it has “sufficient cash on hand to fund ongoing operations of the hospitals to ensure that their patients have continued access to critical care,” however it will begin a marketing process to transition the facilities to new capital providers or owners.

The filing comes as hospital bankruptcies are generally rising. 

Although bankruptcies were slightly down in 2024 compared to record highs of 2023, filings are elevated compared to before the pandemic, according to research from restructuring advisory firm Gibbins Advisors.

Last year, Steward Health Care's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing dominated headlines as the company sold off its massive portfolio of 31 hospitals.

More provider bankruptcies could come in 2025 if industry headwinds continue, experts say. Health systems filing for Chapter 11 restructuring have cited insufficient reimbursements from government programs as a contributing strain on their finances.

I asked if I could purchase the brace myself and bring it to the surgery. The answer was an unequivocal no: the health insurer's contracted rate required me to purchase the brace from the hospital as part of the procedure.

Recently, I had a routine surgery to repair a torn meniscus in my right knee. This was a relatively simple procedure that many Americans need each year, the kind of thing that you would hope would come with no surprises. Instead, what I received was a firsthand look at ways that healthcare in the United States is often designed to drive up costs in pursuit of profit. 

The day before my surgery, I was told that I would have to wear a specialized knee brace following my procedure. The brace would cost $3,300, a hefty price, though only 10% would come out of my own pocket. But as someone who has been in the healthcare space for over a decade, I've learned when to be skeptical about the costs of medical procedures and equipment. 

So, out of curiosity, I researched the make and model of the brace that would be placed on my knee in the operating room. I learned it wasn't a special brace at all. In fact, the same brace could be readily found on sites like Amazon for as little as $150. 


					Balancing healthcare benefits and insurance costs requires research. From becoming a Difference Card member to offering wellness resources, there are many ways to improve healthcare at low cost.				

I asked if I could purchase the brace myself and bring it to the surgery. The answer was an unequivocal no: the health insurer's contracted rate required me to purchase the brace from the hospital as part of the procedure. The exact brace — at 22 times the cost I could buy it from an online retailer — was part of the surgical bundle with my insurance network.An estimated 750,000 knee arthroscopies are performed annually in the United States. If my experience is representative, that means we're paying $2 billion for these braces each year alone. 

Follow the money 

The reason for this experience is as simple as it is disheartening: price gouging and intentional obfuscation have unfortunately become essential ingredients in an industry focused more on maximizing profits than on creating a sustainable and affordable health system. 

To those of us with insurance coverage, some of this may be invisible – a reasonable $20 copay can obscure the potentially thousands of dollars that make up the total cost paid and provides no information on if that was a reasonable price to pay for that drug or service. Those true costs are hidden, and while insurance plays an important role in risk sharing, the current system too often incentivizes price inflation by insurers acting as a middleman.

There is another way. Third-party administrators (TPAs) make money administering health benefit plans on behalf of employers. They charge employers a straightforward monthly service fee, and they don't monetize members visiting the doctor, filling a prescription, or going out of network. In other words, their business model incentivizes them to help people find and access the appropriate care for their needs, not to profit unnecessarily from it. 

Health insurance companies offer administrative-only services as well, but often those services are neither visible nor easy to unravel for health plan members or the companies that contract with them.

For example, when someone receives care from a provider that is not within their health insurance company's network, they are usually met with a higher billed rate. In that case, the health insurance company will offer to negotiate a lower rate and in return, the insurer typically keeps the majority of the difference between the initial amount that was billed by the doctor or facility and the final “allowed” amount they negotiated. It's euphemistically called a “shared savings” arrangement. 

But in reality, there should be no need to have to negotiate a different rate with a physician or facility based on whether it is contracted with an insurance network or not. Just like there should be no difference between the cost of a knee brace depending on whether I buy it on Amazon or get it from the surgeon or hospital. 

Guidance for providers 

Systemic change moves at a glacial pace. But providers, individual members, and benefits leaders can take steps to chip away at the oligopoly. And the first step is transparency. 

For instance, if hospitals were required by law to publish wholesale and retail price lists, consumers would garner a better understanding of the actual acquired costs of drugs and services, compared to what's being passed along to them or to enterprise customers. While hospitals are required to share standard changes, negotiated rates with insurance companies, and discounted cash prices, wholesale prices are still largely kept under wraps. 

But efforts to curtail unexpected and unfair medical bills, like the No Surprises Act (NSA), have faced significant pushback. Widespread adoption of the NSA has been slow to roll out due to litigation from hospitals and insurance companies worried about their bottom lines. 

In the interim, the price data that is being furnished is largely unhelpful. This so-called data consists of jumbled codes that even the most well-versed data scientists have struggled to untangle. 

Guidance for members 

As patients, much of the onus is unfortunately on us to dig into why we're paying what we're paying. The best thing we can do is develop staunch curiosity about every medical bill that comes our way. 

If you're going to be charged for a piece of equipment like a knee brace, do your research like I did. See if alternatives exist at a lower price online. Ask your healthcare providers if you can bring in your own equipment. If they say no, demand to know why. You deserve to know why.

Odds are, they'll tell you it's between you and your insurance company. It's then incumbent on us to ask insurance providers what things will cost. If they aren't willing to tell you, then it's time to bring that information to your employer's HR or benefits team. 

Guidance for employers and benefits leaders 

Once made aware of unfair pricing, benefits leaders should confront their insurance providers directly. Ask them how they make money from your health benefit plan. Be prepared to encounter that veil of complexity and vagueness again. But at least you'll know you've done your due diligence. 

My biggest recommendation for employers struggling to navigate the world of healthcare plans is to work with an independent entity that has no perverse incentive to inflate the price of care. Employers can look by system, geography, or provider to see what providers are charging, and they can analyze distribution to ascertain whether pricing is fair or within a reasonable set of boundaries. 

At the benefit design level, employers can work with third parties to redirect members to providers that don't behave egregiously. If enough people are redirected, then this will force centers to bring pricing in line. 

We can fix US healthcare by asking basic questions

My story is not a unique one, but rather a reflection of how the health insurance oligopoly abuses the average American patient. When I shared this story with my peers, many seemed to have had a similar experience. We spend around twice as much on healthcare as other industrialized nations, and as of February 2024, Americans collectively owe at least $220 billion in medical debt. 

This cannot continue. Pricing must be grounded in economic fact and a reasonable rate of margin, rather than an endless hunger for profit. The best weapon we have against unethical pricing practices is curiosity — our willingness to peel back the veil of obfuscation. The more people ask questions, the more they'll create a groundswell of change. 

And if we pull on the thread of that veil enough, it will unravel.

Dr. Ronald Rodriguez holds a unique title in healthcare. He's professor of medical education and program director of the nation's first MD/MS in Artificial Intelligence dual degree at The University of Texas at San Antonio. The five-year dual degree was launched in 2023.

Rodriguez, who also holds a doctorate in cellular biology, is at the forefront of AI's transformation of healthcare. He is well aware of all the positive ways AI and automation are benefiting healthcare already. But he also sees some aspects of the technology that should give pause to clinicians and IT executives.

This is part one of a two-part interview with Rodriguez. Here he points out matters of AI in healthcare that require great care by professionals – even places where he believes professionals are getting it wrong. Part two, coming soon, will be in video format and discuss the doctor's groundbreaking work in healthcare AI education.

Q. What are some clinicians potentially doing wrong today with generative AI tools, and how can hospital and health system CIOs and other IT and privacy leaders do to make sure generative AI, today, is used correctly?

A. They are not protecting protected health information effectively. Many of the commercial large language model servers take the prompts and data uploaded to their servers and use it for further training later. In many cases, providers are cutting and pasting aggregate clinical data and asking the large language model to reorganize, summarize and provide an assessment.

Unfortunately, many times the patient's PHI is contained in the lab reports, image reports or prior notes in ways that might not be readily apparent to the provider. Failure to eliminate the PHI is a tier 2 HIPAA violation. Each offense could potentially result in a separate fine. IT providers are able to tell when PHI is being cut and pasted and can warn users not to do it. Often this is already happening.

However, currently most of these systems are not enforcing compliance with these rules at the individual level. CIOs and technology leaders at hospitals and health systems can develop PHI removal tools that protect against these violations. Many of the LLM providers allow settings that prevent data sharing; however, enforcement of those settings is at the provider's discretion and not ensured.

Q. You say: ""Our current business model of AI use is an ecosystem where each prompt generates a cost based on the number of tokens. This incremental cost currently is modeled such that it is more likely to actually increase healthcare costs than reduce them."" Please explain what you mean by using a clear example that shows how costs go up.

A. Let's take DAX and Abridge, which are systems that take a recording of the patient-provider interaction, transcribe the interaction and summarize it for use in a note. The costs of these systems is based on actual usage.

The systems make life much easier for physicians, but there is no way to bill the patient for these extra costs through third-party payers. Instead, the only current option to pay for these incremental costs is for the providers to see more patients. Seeing more patients means third-party providers will see more claims, which ultimately will be reflected in higher premiums or lower benefits or both.

Other systems that automate answering patient questions using LLMs may provide immediate feedback to patients with simple questions but also comes at a cost which is incremental. Those costs currently also are not billable, and hence the result is pressure to see more patients.

Let's consider a hospital system implementing one of these generative AI tools to assist physicians with clinical documentation. A single physician might interact with the AI engine multiple times per patient visit.

Now, multiply this across hundreds or thousands of physicians within a health system working across multiple shifts, and the cumulative cost of AI usage quickly skyrockets. Even if AI improves documentation efficiency, the operational expense of frequent AI queries may offset or even exceed the savings from reduced administrative work.

So far, AI usage models are pay-per-use and are not like traditional software with fixed licensing fees. So, the more an organization integrates AI into daily workflows, the higher the financial burden becomes.

Unless hospitals and healthcare providers negotiate cost-effective pricing structures, implement usage controls or develop in-house AI systems, they may find themselves in a situation where AI adoption leads to escalating operational costs rather than the anticipated savings.

Q. You told me: ""Safeguards need to be put in place before we will ever realize a true improvement in our overall medical errors. Over-reliance on AI to correct mistakes could potentially result in different types of errors."" Please elaborate on the problem, and please discuss the needed safeguards, in your opinion.

A. LLMs are prone to hallucinations under certain situations. While some providers are very good at avoiding those situations – we actually teach our students how to avoid such situations – many are not aware. A new source of medical errors can be introduced if these errors are not caught. One way to safeguard against this is to use agentic specialty-specific AI LLMs.

These systems perform double checks on the information, confirm its veracity and use sophisticated methods to minimize errors. However, such systems are not built into the off-the-shelf LLMs like ChatGPT or Claud AI. They will cost more to use, and they will require a larger investment in infrastructure.

Investment in the infrastructure to protect privacy, prevent unintended sharing of PHI, and protect against predictable LLMs and misconceptions rampant in the internet data scraping used for pretraining of the foundational LLMs, will be required. Policies to enforce compliance will also be necessary.

Q. How should hospitals and health systems go about developing proper ethical policies, guidelines and oversight?

A. As AI technologies rapidly advance, major medical organizations need to provide guidance documents, and boilerplate policies that can help institutions adopt best practices. This can be accomplished at several levels.

Participation in oversight organizations and medical groups like the AMA, AAMC and governmental oversight committees can help solidify a common framework for ethical AI data access and use policies.

The digital health IPO market has slowed to a crawl in recent years, but it could be poised for a turnaround in 2025, experts say.

Hinge, a decade-old firm that's secured hundreds of millions in venture capital investment, offers digital musculoskeletal care and physical therapy, including through an artificial intelligence-backed movement sensor and a wearable device that provides electrical nerve stimulation.

The company largely works with self-insured employers, but Hinge is also starting to offer its services through fully-insured health plans and Medicare Advantage plans, according to a securities filing. 

At the end of last year, Hinge had 2,250 clients and more than 532,000 members, the company said. The firm argues the market for musculoskeletal care is huge — for example, nearly 40% of adults reported lower back pain in 2019, according to the CDC. 

“Our first decade in business has been focused on physical therapy (PT)—with $70B in estimated annual spend in the United States, PT provides a long runway ahead for our business,” Hinge co-founder and CEO Daniel Perez wrote in a letter to investors. “Over the coming years we'll continue applying technology to automate other aspects of care, with several new products already in development.”

Hinge hasn't yet determined the price range or the number of shares that will be offered in the IPO, according to a press release. The company plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol HNGE.

Hinge's IPO is one of just a few recent digital health filings. Although the number of firms going public soared in 2021, alongside record-breaking venture capital investment in the sector, the digital health IPO market froze soon after.

Only one company went public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company in 2022, and zero digital health firms notched a public exit the following year, according to consultancy and VC firm Rock Health. 

However, a couple companies, like healthcare payments firm Waystar and precision medicine company Tempus AI, went public in 2024. More firms are likely considering going public this year, experts say. If newly public firms that make the leap in the first half of the year perform well, the second half of 2025 could have more activity, Neil Patel, head of ventures at startup builder Redesign Health, told Healthcare Dive late last year.

“It can't just be like a one-day, 30-day, 60-day spike in price. It has to be like sustained over some period of time,” he said. “And so just the question is, what's enough?”

On March 10, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) released a proposed rule to address the number of improper enrollments impacting the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Health Insurance Marketplaces. 

The CMS' 2025 Marketplace Integrity and Affordability Proposed Rule includes proposals that take steps to protect people from being enrolled in Marketplace coverage without their knowledge or consent, promote stable and affordable health insurance markets, and ensure taxpayer dollars fund financial assistance only for the people the ACA set out to support. 

According to a press release by CMS, “After the 2023 benefit year closed, CMS began receiving a dramatic uptick in complaints from consumers who claimed they had been enrolled in Marketplace coverage without their consent. Research suggests 4 to 5 million people were improperly enrolled in subsidized ACA coverage in 2024, costing federal taxpayers up to $20 billion.”

If finalized, the rule would reduce the open enrollment period for all marketplaces to Nov. 1 through Dec. 15. Additionally, the availability of the monthly special enrollment period (SEP) for individuals with household incomes below 150 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) would end, a policy that currently allows people to wait to enroll until they become sick instead of promoting continuous enrollment.

The proposed policies would reinstate policies formerly finalized during the prior Trump administration. CMS proposes a policy that would add sex-trait modification to the list of items and services that may not be covered as essential health benefits beginning in plan year 2026.

In line with Trump's Executive Order on Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders, the proposed rule would also revert to a previous definition of “lawfully present” that excludes Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients for purposes of enrolling in Marketplace coverage.

TAMPA, Fla. — There is no denying that artificial intelligence has crept into nearly every aspect of our lives at a breakneck pace. It was only a matter of time before AI made it to healthcare. Many doctors, politicians, and experts are asking how AI will be used. 

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE EXAM ROOM

""The difference with ambient AI is it's actually more close to an intelligent human scribe,"" Dr. Nishit Patel, Vice President and Chief Medical Informatics Officer at Tampa General Hospital, said.

Last year, TGH launched new AI-powered software called Ambient Listening. More than 500 doctors are participating in the program. The doctor simply sets the phone down to record the conversation (with patient approval), and the software transcribes it in seconds.

Doctors can spend on average 4.5 hours per day working on paperwork or electronic documentation. Dr. Patel said this saves time while capturing precise medical information gathered during the appointment.

""These tools help us get through the massive amounts of unstructured paperwork and data we have that insurance companies are trying to go through to figure out if this is an appropriate authorization. And, so I think hopefully if we use these tools in the optimal ethical way to do the right thing for the patient, we all win,"" Dr. Patel said. ""What I fear, though, is that if a payer or a health system is trying to use these tools to sort of win a battle, what we end up in is much more of an AI arms race, where, frankly, nobody really wins. And so I think these tools have the opportunity for us to get authorizations more timely.""

Pre-authorizations and peer-to-peer reviews have come under scrutiny as doctors and medical professionals are speaking out about dealing with health insurance companies.

ABC Action News reporter Michael Paluska recently reported on those doctors for the ongoing series, ""Patient No More.”

INSURANCE DENIALS USING AI

""Are insurance companies using AI to really kick out and deny batch claims by the hundreds or maybe thousands at one moment?"" Paluska asked Dr. John Licato, Associate Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department.

""What I can say is that the technology to do it is definitely there, and the technology to auto-reject a claim is not necessarily even that sophisticated,"" Licato said. ""There are lawsuits going on that accuse insurance companies of doing things like that, but, you know, it's impossible to know for sure what they're actually doing. That's going to come out in the trials, hopefully.""

""If AI is rejecting claims, then the patient will probably have to use AI to fight the claims because the AI is so good, a human won't be able to beat it?"" Paluska asked.

""Yeah, and that is exactly an example of the kind of arms race that we're anticipating,"" Licato said.

""AI will have a really big part in whether or not your care goes through?"" Paluska asked.

""Yeah,"" Licato said.

""So something gets denied, like a claim. I guess it's going to be on the doctors now to figure it out and get their patients covered until AI is being used in a way where it's balanced?"" Paluska asked.

""I'm skeptical that that balance will ever be found, though. I think it's just going to be a continuing arms race. You know, maybe you'll reach a temporary equilibrium, but some breakthrough is going to happen,"" Licato said.

States are trying to get ahead of the technology. Several across the country are passing laws to make sure a human reviews any claims rejected by AI.

Florida State Senator Jennifer Bradley filed SB794 this legislative session.

According to the bill:

""My initial reaction to that is, I'm not sure how you'd enforce that, right? You know, you say, okay, a human has to review this. What is to stop them from just saying, 'Yeah, I looked it over.' Then you see this text that was generated here. 'I read that. It looks okay to me.' I don't know how you'd enforce that.""

Teladoc Health has entered into a pharmacy integration agreement with Eli Lilly's LillyDirect pharmacy partner, Gifthealth, which is intended to help streamline access to Zepbound medication for members enrolled in the Comprehensive Weight Care Program.

The move is meant to provide safer and more seamless access to GLP-1 medications for members without insurance coverage.

LillyDirect is Eli Lilly and Company's direct-to-consumer digital healthcare platform. Eligible Teladoc Health members, if prescribed Zepbound by their provider for an on-label indication, can have single-use vials of the medication delivered to their home.

Teladoc Health's Comprehensive Weight Care and Primary360 teams will have full visibility into each stage of the process, from dispensing to shipping to delivery to refills, Teladoc said.

The estimated out-of-pocket cost for Zepbound per month is $1,060, according to Sesame Care.

WHAT'S THE IMPACT?

In addition to access, members enrolled in the weight care program will have support from licensed clinicians trained in obesity medicine, as well as registered dietitians and health coaches, Teladoc said.

Members will receive a connected digital scale, personalized lifestyle coaching, nutrition counseling, mental health support and behavior change resources to help them manage and maintain a healthy weight.

Teladoc said its end-to-end programs ""drive high levels of health engagement"" and sustained outcomes for members taking GLP-1 medications.

""We provide the integrated support necessary for patient safety and sustainable health outcomes,"" said Kelly Bliss, president, U.S. Group Health at Teladoc. ""By integrating with LillyDirect, we are reducing barriers to high-quality care and helping our members afford transformative FDA-approved treatments while avoiding the potential risks of compounded medications recently offered by others.""

THE LARGER TREND

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1s) have been used to treat diabetes and obesity, said a 2024 Health Affairs study. Beyond their effects on diabetes, these products have been shown to reduce body weight by more than 15% and improve other clinical outcomes, such as reducing the risk for major adverse cardiovascular events and reducing symptoms of heart failure.

Wegovy and Zepbound are now approved for weight management in patients with either a body mass index (BMI) of at least 27 and at least one obesity-related comorbidity, such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol, according to Health Affairs.

The HIMSS Electronic Health Record (EHR) Association has responded to the proposed HIPAA Security Rule update by urging the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) to factor in EHR developer company time when determining compliance timelines and requirements to ensure that EHR developers can effectively meet expectations without disrupting essential health IT services.

In February, seven organizations, including the College of Healthcare Information Management Executives (CHIME), the Association of American Medical Colleges, the Federation of American Hospitals, and the Medical Group Management Association, sent a letter to the Department of Health & Human Services asking that the proposed rule be rescinded. They said the “unfunded mandates associated with this regulation would place an undue financial strain on hospitals and healthcare systems.”

It is not clear yet whether the Trump Administration will follow through with the rule proposed under the Biden Administration. 

The EHR Association, which has 27 member companies, prepared an analysis that shows that the compliance effort would require 12,572 hours—more than 314 person-weeks—which is in addition to the hours OCR estimated for covered entities and group health plan sponsors.

The EHR Association also stressed that continuing to offer flexibility in the finalized policies will be essential to avoid adding excessive or unmanageable burden for smaller organizations that may have only a few staff members (and, in some cases, may not have even one team member focused on compliance with the security rule).

The association also recommended clarifying several definitions in the final rule. For instance, it suggests that it would be helpful to align the definition of “Security Incident” with NIST standards to ensure consistency in cybersecurity incident response expectations across different contexts. Additionally, it suggested removing or clarifying references to “attempted” breaches to avoid unnecessary reporting burdens for routine network activity, such as pings, which do not constitute meaningful security threats. Instead, the definition should focus on concerted efforts to breach or compromise a system, ensuring that compliance efforts are directed toward addressing genuine security risks.

Regarding business associate contracts, the EHR Association recommends that OCR provide specific examples of what constitutes sufficient “assurances” in Business Associate Agreements (BAAs), such as ISO certifications, SOC 2 Type II reports, or similar industry-recognized security attestations. Clear guidance on acceptable assurance methods would streamline compliance efforts for regulated entities and business associates while ensuring consistent security expectations across the healthcare ecosystem, the association said. 

To help regulated entities balance security and system efficiency, OCR should provide clear guidance on appropriate encryption levels within a system, given the multiple layers where encryption can be applied, the group said. This would enable organizations to meet compliance obligations while optimizing costs and system performance, avoidingunnecessary expenditures on additional hardware or capacity.

LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ViiV Healthcare, the global specialist HIV company majority owned by GSK, with Pfizer and Shionogi as shareholders, today announced positive findings from the company's EMBRACE phase IIb study.1 The study found that N6LS (VH3810109 or VH109), given every four months in combination with monthly cabotegravir long-acting (CAB LA), successfully kept viral levels suppressed in adults living with HIV who were already stable on treatment. It was also well tolerated by participants.



These results were presented today at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI 2025) in San Francisco, U.S.



Kimberly Smith, M.D., MPH, Head of Research & Development at ViiV Healthcare, said: ""As leaders in long-acting injectable innovation, we are building on the positive patient and physician experience we have with Cabenuva and pioneering the next generation of long-acting treatment options. The EMBRACE study demonstrated that VH109, a CD4-binding broadly neutralising antibody, administered every four months with cabotegravir, achieved high efficacy and was well tolerated through six months. We're looking forward to continuing the development of VH109 as a component of our future ultra long-acting regimens.”



Results from the EMBRACE study at the six-month primary endpoint showed that 96% of participants receiving VH109 60mg/kg intravenously (IV) and 88% receiving VH109 3000mg subcutaneously (SC) with rHuPH20 maintained HIV-1 RNA levels below 50 copies/mL, compared to 96% in the standard-of-care group. VH109 was administered in both arms every four months, combined with monthly CAB LA. Confirmed virologic failure was observed in two participants from each VH109 group.



Overall, 4% of the IV group and 6% of the SC group had HIV-1 RNA levels of 50 copies/mL or higher, compared to none in the standard-of-care group when measured at month six.



VH109 was generally well tolerated, though infusion site reactions were more frequent with SC administration, occurring in 14% compared to none with IV administration. Adverse events specific to the use of study medication were reported in 64% of the IV group and 65% of the SC group, with 16% of participants in the SC group experiencing grade 3-4 adverse events (erythema). No participants in the IV group experienced a grade 3-4 adverse event.



Based on the favourable results seen in the trial, ViiV Healthcare will be progressing a six-month IV formulation of VH109 in combination with CAB LA for further evaluation in an EMBRACE part two trial.



About Cabenuva (cabotegravir + rilpivirine)
Cabenuva is indicated as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and adolescents 12 years and older and weighing at least 35kg to replace the current antiretroviral regimen in those who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 c/ml) on a stable antiretroviral regimen with no history of treatment failure and with no known or suspected resistance to either cabotegravir or rilpivirine.



The complete regimen combines the integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) cabotegravir, developed by ViiV Healthcare, with rilpivirine, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) developed by Janssen Sciences Ireland Unlimited Company. Rilpivirine tablets are approved in the U.S. and when used with cabotegravir is indicated for short-term treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and adolescents 12 years and older and weighing at least 35kg who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/mL) on a stable regimen with no history of treatment failure and with no known or suspected resistance to either cabotegravir or rilpivirine.



INSTIs inhibit HIV replication by preventing the viral DNA from integrating into the genetic material of human immune cells (T-cells). This step is essential in the HIV replication cycle and is also responsible for establishing chronic disease. Rilpivirine is an NNRTI that works by interfering with an enzyme called reverse transcriptase, which stops the virus from multiplying.

BUENOS AIRES (AP) — An Argentine court on Tuesday started its trial of seven healthcare professionals accused of negligence in the death of soccer great Diego Maradona, at age 60.

Maradona was under the care of those professionals when he had a cardiac arrest in a house outside Buenos Aires on Nov. 25, 2020.

Three judges will decide whether those charged, including a neurosurgeon, a psychiatrist and several medical staffers, are guilty of manslaughter. The maximum jail time for those sentenced is 25 years.

According to the prosecution, the accused professionals didn't provide adequate medical care.

Prosecutor Patricio Ferrari said he will provide evidence that, between Nov. 11-25 2020, Maradona was taken to a house in a private neighborhood in the town of Tigre, on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, without being in “full use of his mental faculties” to decide on home hospitalization.

Ferrari said it was a reckless hospitalization in which there was no control.

 “After condemning him to oblivion in that house... they deliberately and cruelly decided that he should die,” he said. 

The prosecutor showed an image of the former soccer star lying in the bed where he was found dead with his abdomen visibly swollen.

The tearful family of the 1986 World Cup winner were present at the courtroom. Maradona's oldest daughters, Dalma and Giannina, sat in the front row near Verónica Ojeda, former partner of the footballer, and Jana, another of his daughters.




Minutes before the start of the trial, Ojeda shared a video on social media of Maradona's son Diego Fernando wearing a T-shirt with the face of the football star, and the word “justice.”

The trial could last up to four months and there will be three hearings per week.

The spotlight is on neurosurgeon Leonardo Luque, Maradona's personal physician for the last four years of his life. He performed surgery to remove a blood clot from the former footballer's brain just weeks before his death.

Six other professionals will be on trial. Psychiatrist Agustina Cosachov, who prescribed the medication that Maradona took until the time of his death, psychologist Carlos Díaz, Nancy Forlini, a coordinator of the medical company hired for Maradona's care during his hospitalization, Mariano Perroni, a representative of the company that rendered nursing service, Dr. Pedro Di Spagna, who monitored his treatment, and nurse Ricardo Almirón.

Gisela Madrid, a nurse who was also indicted, will be tried by a jury later this year.

Your company is spending a lot on traditional healthcare coverage — and probably multiple supplemental wellness offerings — to help workers manage chronic conditions. Providing a single-point solution that helps employees manage multiple conditions can improve their health, consolidate benefits and cut down on employer costs.

Compared with other high-income countries, the U.S. has the highest rate of adults with more than one chronic condition, according to the Commonwealth Fund. Data from the CDC shows six in 10 have at least one chronic illness and that the majority of healthcare costs are connected to patients with these issues. In addition to direct costs, research from multiple sources puts employer financial loss — due to lost productivity and absenteeism — in the hundreds of billions.

Management of chronic conditions means higher prescription drug usage and cost, as well. Sixty percent of the general population report being on at least one prescription medication, according to KFF, but this number skyrockets for people with certain chronic health issues: For instance, data from Georgetown University shows that adults with diabetes typically take four times as many prescriptions as those without it. 

Many of the people managing chronic conditions do not fall into the super high-claimant category, but they require far more than just basic wellness perks to improve their health, says Kurt Cegielski, chief commercial officer at MOBE, a platform that helps people manage their health, including chronic conditions, lifestyle habits and medications. 

""The average person we work with has 15 different maintenance medications prescribed by nine different providers,"" he says. ""You go to the doctor, then they typically write you a script. And you don't even talk to a pharmacist. You drive through, they ask you your address, maybe your phone number to make sure it's you. And they say, 'Do you have any questions?' Now imagine you're one of these people with 15 different drugs and three chronic conditions.""

Cegielski describes this middle-ground population as one that interacts frequently with the healthcare system, but trying to navigate numerous employer-provided solutions for individual health issues makes things needlessly complicated. By offering a platform that specializes in cross-condition care, employers can make it easier for participants to engage with healthcare experts and information, leading to better outcomes, Cegielski says. 

MOBE members are paired with a guide — a health professional who can help with areas such as sleep, stress, nutrition and fitness — and a clinical pharmacist. Relevant educational resources are provided through its app, and it has an AI predictive analytics feature which can help identify members at risk for new or worsening conditions based on their connected claims information and personal interactions with the platform. 

""[People] need someone to help them through each and every step of this process, because the path to better health and improvement is complicated and long,"" he says. ""I know I can message [my guide] 24/7, [and they're] pushing me content relevant to our recent conversation. It just fills a need that our healthcare system, unfortunately, is not filling.""

The platform's average employee engagement within the first year is 30%, their data shows. Additionally, by making it easier for employees with chronic issues to connect the dots to better overall health, employers stand to see a return on investment in the forms of improved health outcomes, happier employees and lower long-term costs, says Cegielski. 

""We need to rethink how we serve [these employees], and if we do so, we're going to create solutions that work better, engage more people, and ultimately impact cost, not only today, but tomorrow, as we hopefully keep some of them from progressing into that large claim bucket.""

Focusing on employees' overall health and wellness can help improve chronic conditions and cut down on employer healthcare spend.

Physicians are again shortchanged in a spending bill proposal to avert a government shutdown by the end of this week.

The continuing resolution that passed the House on Tuesday, and which now moves on to the Senate, contains no provision to stop the 2.8% Medicare physician pay cut that went into effect on Jan. 1.

""Physicians across the country are outraged that Congress's proposed spending package locks in a devastating fifth consecutive year of Medicare cuts, threatening access to care for 66 million Medicare patients,"" said AMA President Dr. Bruce A. Scott by statement. ""Despite repeated warnings, lawmakers are once again ignoring the dire consequences of these cuts and their impact both on patients and the private practices struggling to keep their doors open.""

WHY THIS MATTERS

Physicians are leaving their practices, Scott said.

""Two of my partners have given up,"" Scott said last month. ""And as of Jan. 1, they're leaving private practice, and they're going to become employed. Not because they want to leave private practice – but because of the challenges that we're talking about.""

In a statement issued Sunday, Scott said the ""decision to allow the 2.8% cut to go forward is particularly devastating for rural and underserved communities.""

After adjusting for the inflation in practice costs, Medicare payment to physician practices has dropped 33% since 2001, he said.

""Let me be clear: These unsustainable cuts will force more practices to close and leave patients with fewer options for care. ... Medicare patients will pay the price,"" Scott said. 

THE LARGER TREND

In December 2024, then-President Joe Biden signed a spending bill to avert  a government shutdown, but some healthcare provisions that were in an original bill didn't make it to final passage after Congress drafted a last-minute plan.

Stripped out of the pared-down bill was a provision to prevent the 2.8% Medicare pay cut to physicians. 

Both acute hospital-care-at-home and telehealth temporary waivers were continued until March 31, when the government spending legislation expires. The CR allows telehealth provisions to continue for another six months.

This is the fifth consecutive year of Medicare pay cuts for physicians. The pay cut comes on top of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services projecting a 3.5% rise in the Medicare Economic Index, which measures the cost of running a medical practice.

A Medicare Patient Access and Practice Stabilization Act of 2025 introduced in January in the House would have stopped the payment cut, but it's gone no further than being introduced.

Innovative Platform Delivers Real-Time Pricing Data and Streamlines Compliance with New Regulations

VIENNA, Va., March 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- In response to President Donald J. Trump's newly signed executive order reinforcing healthcare price transparency regulations, careviso, a leader in healthcare technology solutions and prior authorizations (PA), is proud to announce how its seeQer platform is empowering patients and healthcare providers with real-time, accurate, and actionable pricing data for medical services and prescription drugs.

Although the No Surprises Act was enacted over four years ago to prevent surprise medical bills, especially in emergencies or out-of-network care at in-network facilities, inconsistent enforcement still leaves many patients vulnerable to high costs. Despite regulatory efforts, many insurers and hospitals continue to obscure real pricing data or publish machine-readable files so large that meaningful price comparisons become nearly impossible for patients. This executive order, however, aims to close these gaps by directing the Departments of the Treasury, Labor, and Health and Human Services to ensure that hospitals and insurers disclose actual prices—not estimates—giving patients a clearer path to making informed healthcare decisions.

careviso's seeQer platform is at the forefront of this change, aligning seamlessly with these transparency regulations by giving patients and providers unprecedented clarity into healthcare costs. By delivering real-time, accurate pricing data and eliminating the hidden fees and price discrepancies that have long burdened American families, seeQer helps ensure that healthcare pricing transparency is no longer just a policy goal, but a practical reality. In addition to pricing transparency, the platform offers real-time benefits verification (RTBV), allowing patients to instantly access details on their coverage, out-of-pocket costs, and network eligibility. Additionally, seeQer's Advanced Explanation of Benefits (AEOB) feature provides a comprehensive breakdown of expected costs before a procedure or treatment occurs, helping patients avoid surprise bills and make the most cost-effective healthcare choices.

While this executive order marks a significant step forward, it primarily focuses on hospitals and insurers, leaving a critical gap for other healthcare service providers. Many routine medical procedures—such as those performed in physician offices or ambulatory surgical centers—are not fully addressed in these new regulations, meaning patients may still face challenges in accessing transparent pricing for a significant portion of their healthcare needs. As the industry moves toward greater accountability, solutions like seeQer help bridge these gaps, ensuring that patients have access to the full scope of financial information they need, regardless of where they seek care.

""At careviso, we believe price transparency is the foundation for improving patient access to quality healthcare,"" said Andrew Mignatti, CEO of careviso. ""seeQer gives providers and patients the real-time information they need to make informed, cost-effective decisions. By simplifying the financial side of healthcare, we're making it more accessible for everyone, giving patients the transparency they deserve about their healthcare.""

As healthcare providers and insurers work to meet these new regulatory requirements, careviso stands ready to support the industry with cutting-edge technology that streamlines compliance and enhances transparency.

Less than two months ago, 52-year-old Oklahoma State Representative Melissa Provenzano underwent a mastectomy for stage one HER2-positive breast cancer. 

Less than two months ago, 52-year-old Oklahoma State Representative Melissa Provenzano underwent a mastectomy for stage one HER2-positive breast cancer.

""Luckily, the prognosis is good because I caught it so early. Mine was less than a centimeter,"" said Provenzano.

She said since her mother's breast cancer diagnosis 10 years ago, she doesn't skip mammograms.

""I usually get them in September or October, but I pushed it back to the very beginning of November because of campaign season,"" said Provenzano.

Her mother was in the clear for a decade, then at 72-years-old, the cancer came back. In November, her mom had a mastectomy.

""Then I got my mammogram and they're like well we need you to come in. She had her surgery in November and then in December I was diagnosed and I was like are you kidding. Then I got my mammogram and they're like well we need you to come in and by December 11th, I had been diagnosed with a different type of breast cancer than my mother,"" said Provenzano.

In 2022 Provenzano's legislation, House Bill 3504, forced health insurance companies to cover follow up tests, like MRIs and ultrasounds, once a mammogram spots an abnormality.

""Such common sense things that you don't think about until you're in it. It looks so different now it's like oh I understand exactly why this is such a deal,"" said Provenzano.

Before Provenzano fought to get those diagnostic tests covered, women were being forced to make tough choices.

""So back in 2022, I had a woman reach out to me and say so the price is depending on your insurance, anywhere $400 and $1,200 and I have to put food on the table. I'm a single mom, what are we doing,"" said Provenzano.

When the governor signed House Bill 3504, Oklahoma became the 10th state to pass legislation requiring insurance to cover further tests when a mammogram shows an abnormality.

""I cant tell you how many women have reached out to me to say you know, either thank you because wow I actually got a check back the first year it passed, because I'd already paid for it and my insurance company refunded the money. The Komen Foundation actually came out and said it's actually saving millions of dollars across the state for women,"" said Provenzano.

Now, 27 other states have similar laws. While she's fighting breast cancer, Provenzano is also fighting to pass House Bill 1389, which clarifies the language about exactly which tests health insurance must pay for.

""We're also finding that depending on where you live in the state of Oklahoma, the machine available to you might be different, so we want to capture all of those things under this umbrella. This leaves that in 2022. This leaves the decision as to what you need best between you and your doctor,"" said Provenzano.

She said her oncologist is working around her crazy schedule at the Capitol. On Fridays, she's back in Tulsa and that's when she goes for chemotherapy.

Provenzano tested negative for the BRCA gene that her mother carries. Her sister plans to get tested, just weeks before her own diagnosis and one week before their mother's mastectomy. She and her sister got matching tattoos.

""We got this in honor of my mother,"" said Provenzano.

She says she doesn't know anyone who hasn't had a friend or loved one fight breast cancer, it crosses party lines.

""Republicans, Democrats, just kind of gathering around you and offering support and what is it that we need and how can we support you,"" said Provenzano.

At last month's Pink Stilleto Gala, the Susan G. Komen Foundation named Provenzano the 2025 Woman of Inspiration. An honor that's very special, but she's not doing this work for accolades.

""This one thing can save a life. If I can save one life. I feel pretty lucky,"" said Provenzano.

House Bill 1389 had bipartisan support. FOX23 will keep tabs on it and let you know if it reaches the governor's desk.

A federal judge blocked Donald Trump's executive order banning trans youth healthcare, but access remains uncertain

Aryn Kavanaugh was sitting in her living room in South Carolina when her 17-year-old daughter came into the room and said: “I'm really scared. I think people are gonna die.” Katherine, who is using her middle name for her protection, told Kavanaugh that she thought transgender youth may be the target of violence due to the hate generated by Donald Trump's recent action.

On 28 January, Trump issued an executive order to ban access to gender-affirming care for youth under 19 years old. It directed federal agencies to deny funding to institutions that offer gender-affirming medical care including hormones and puberty blockers.

“She just felt like the world was crumbling around her. So we talked it out and tried to stay super positive,” said Kavanaugh, a parent of two trans children. “I think she really feels like we're on the edge of chaos.”

In a victory for trans kids and their families, a federal judge in Maryland blocked the ban on 4 March. The preliminary injunction extended a mid-February restraining order that blocked Trump's directive and will remain in effect until further order from the US district court for the district of Maryland. In the meantime, the order prohibits the government from withholding federal funding to healthcare facilities that provide treatment to trans youth.

Still, the executive order sent parents, children and medical providers into a tailspin as they deciphered its impacts. Some hospitals immediately canceled appointments and turned away new patients to adhere to the directive. In early February, Katherine was dropped as a patient at Virginia Commonwealth University, where she received gender-affirming care after South Carolina banned hormone therapy, surgery and puberty blockers for trans youth last year. Some parents say that their children's mental health severely declined in the weeks following the executive order. And as a result, families have gone to great lengths to ensure that their trans kids continue to receive care, including considering moving abroad or stocking up on puberty suppressants.

“We have seen dozens of families affected across the United States, in many, many states that have been left and abandoned without care that they need,” said Omar Gonzalez-Pagan, senior counsel and healthcare strategist at the LGBTQ+ civil rights organization Lambda Legal. “This is an unlawful executive order because it seeks to override the congressional mandate to condition federal financial assistance on non-discrimination, and this order seeks to require discrimination as a condition of federal funding.”

The pause follows a lawsuit filed on 4 February by civil rights organizations including Lambda Legal and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) on behalf of transgender youth. ACLU staff told the Guardian that they anticipated that the preliminary injunction would remain through the court proceedings.

Some hospitals that stopped providing care to trans youth after the January directive, such as Children's Hospital Los Angeles and Children's Hospital of Richmond, lifted limits on surgeries or hormonal therapy in late February. Kavanaugh said she was “relieved and hopeful” about the preliminary injunction, though it does not roll back South Carolina's ban on trans youth healthcare, which was signed into law last year.

Her 18-year-old trans son Parker and Katherine received treatment at Medical University of South Carolina and then a private clinic in the state for several years until Henry McMaster, the governor of South Carolina, signed into law a ban on gender-affirming care for trans minors in May 2024. Parker is now old enough to receive his care in South Carolina, but the state ban means that the family has had to drive more than five hours each way to Virginia Commonwealth University for Katherine's doctors' appointments and medicine every few months.

Being dropped as a patient due to the federal ban “puts us in a really tough spot because we're already having to find care outside of South Carolina. And so that just limits our options,” Kavanaugh said. Katherine's doctors connected her to a private medical practice in Fairfax, Virginia, that does not receive federal funding, so they were able to avoid a lapse in her care. While the change in providers did not cost more money, it stretched their commute to more than seven hours.

In late February, Katherine's puberty-blocker treatment at Virginia Commonwealth University resumed. In a statement, the hospital said that patients would continue medications, but that surgeries would remain suspended. Trans kids' treatment remains in limbo as federal challenges wind through the court.

Studies have shown that gender-affirming medical care greatly improves trans people's mental health and quality of life. A 2022 report published in the journal JAMA Network Open analyzed data from a study of 104 transgender and non-binary youth from ages 13 to 20 who received hormonal therapy or puberty blockers at the Seattle Children's Gender Clinic for a year. Researchers found that 60% of participants reported lower rates of depression and 73% had less odds of suicidal ideation and self harm after receiving gender-affirming hormones and puberty blockers.

Black transgender people, who experience the intersecting stigma of being gender diverse and racial minorities, are at even greater risk of poor mental health. A 2022 national survey of 33,993 LGBTQ+ young people by the Trevor Project, a non-profit, found that one in four Black transgender and nonbinary youth attempted suicide in the past year, more than double the rate of their cisgender counterparts.

“It's already difficult to access healthcare and treatment. It's additionally difficult for folks who belong to other marginalized communities, especially families and children of color, as well as folks who are on various forms of state-funded insurance and may have difficulty selecting their providers to begin with,” Harper Seldin, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU, told the Guardian.

“There is already a subset of gender clinics in this country who provide this care. When you lay over on top of that insurance and access based on family means, it's particularly devastating for families who can't just pick up and go somewhere else – to another city, state or other country – to get care.”

While her trans daughter's care hasn't been directly affected by the executive order, Sarah, a Texas mother who asked that her last name not be used to protect her daughter's privacy, said that her daughter Raven was devastated by the president's directive. Raven, a 16-year-old Black trans girl in Texas who is using a pseudonym, dropped out of school last month due to her declining mental health, exacerbated by the federal ban. Sarah said that Raven had rarely got out of bed, and when she did, she would show her mom news reports of murdered Black trans girls and women.

“She has told me that she's afraid of being killed if she leaves the house,” Sarah said. “She really only will leave the house with me. But that's very few and far between, because she's just incredibly depressed.”

Since dropping out of school, Sarah said that Raven's depression and anxiety significantly decreased, and she plans to start GED test preparation classes over the summer.

In November 2024, the LGBTQ+ non-profit Human Rights Campaign Foundation released a report that showed that half of the 36 transgender people killed in the last 12 months were Black trans women. That reality has made it terrifying for Raven to live as a Black trans girl, Sarah said.

Raven's medical providers have increased her antidepressants dosage, and she now checks in with her psychiatrist every three weeks. Since last year, Raven has had to fly to Colorado every six months to receive gender-affirming care due to a Texas ban on treatment for minors. She has received grants from the non-profit Campaign on Southern Equality to fund the travel for medical treatment, which has helped defer some of the exorbitant costs of seeking out-of-state care.

Sarah said that she has researched living in other nations and would be willing to order medicine from Canada if Raven could no longer get medical treatment in Colorado. Gender-affirming care has drastically improved Raven's life. “She feels more herself,” Sarah said. “If she didn't have it, I don't think she would choose to stay alive.”

Navigating medical care restrictions has caused anxiety for parents who are shouldering the burden of the policies' twists and turns for their children. A Georgia-based parent, Peter Isbister, said that he had chosen not to share the news of the executive order with his 11-year-old trans son Lev, who is using a pseudonym out of fear of harassment: “It's taken a psychological toll on his parents, not on him.”

An endocrinologist is currently monitoring Lev's hormone levels to determine when he will be put on puberty blockers. Isbister, an attorney and founder of the peer support network Metro Atlanta TransParent, has to contend with the federal executive order and a looming ban on puberty blockers for minors in Georgia.

“If the bill passes in Georgia, then we as a family are going to really have to study up more seriously on how it works to be an out-of-state person to get care in California, New Mexico, Massachusetts or wherever,” Isbister said. “And the more states that restrict access to care, the harder that's going to be.”

As a result of the federal and state policies, Isbister said that he has talked with an immigration attorney about acquiring Canadian citizenship for his son. But at least for now, Lev's clinic continues to provide him care.

While Isbister was “heartened” by the judge's injunction on the executive order, he said that it is “wrenching and in my view unjust that my ability to provide my kid healthcare should be an issue for our federal courts”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

At Lakeland Robin's job is to spend time with residents, have conversations with them, play games and other activities.

FORT WAYNE, Ind. (WFFT) – Lakeland Rehabilitation and Healthcare Center unveiled a new staff member whose name is Robin the robot.

Robin is an A.I. generated social interactive robot.

At Lakeland, Robin's job is to spend time with residents, have conversations with them, play games and other activities.

The robot will work in the memory care unit specializing with residents that suffer from Alzheimer's and dementia.

“As that disease progresses, they begin to sometimes become a little bit more reclusive as they're not able to communicate as they once were so Robin will really assist in that nature of spending that one-on-one time with each resident,"" Executive Director Lindsey Floyd said.

Residents got to spend some time with the new staff member before the unveiling.

“I thought it was really interesting, we played a game, she [Robin] told me I'm a genius,"" resident Donald Boneff.

Lakeland staff learned they would get Robin at the end of 2024. Robin is the second AI-generated robot in long-term care in Indiana.

Floyd says Robin will work a shift of its own.

“Once we unplug her, get her geared up and ready for the day, and then enter the day about 4 o'clock so she'll just bebop around the facility, engage with residents,"" Floyd said.

A party that has sharply criticized President Donald Trump's threat to take over Greenland secured a surprise election victory Tuesday in the Danish territory, but it may have to govern with a partner with a far warmer view of the U.S. president.  

The center-right, pro-business Demokraatit party, which favors a gradual move toward independence from Denmark, won 30% of the total vote share, not enough to single-handedly rule the Arctic territory. The party will instead need to partner with opponents to form a coalition.  

Foremost among those other parties is the second-placed opposition party Naleraq, which won a quarter of the vote share, favors rapid independence and has reserved warm words for the Trump administration. 

The victory of two parties who favor independence — seceding from Denmark is broadly popular in Greenland — may be taken as a positive in Washington, where interest in the world's largest island has sharply jumped since President Trump began his second term.

Greenland won the right to hold a referendum to gain full independence from Denmark in 2009, but a poll at the time also found that many were divided on the pace at which to do so. Greenland currently is in charge of its own domestic affairs, while Denmark controls decisions on foreign and defense policy.

""We don't want independence tomorrow, we want a good foundation,” the Demokraatit leader and incumbent prime minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen told reporters Tuesday night in the capital, Nuuk.

Trump sees Greenland's vast mineral wealth and existing U.S. military base as being of strategic importance as the Arctic region opens up and increasingly comes into play in the geopolitical arena, but both Nuuk and Copenhagen have rebuffed those overtures.

“We need Greenland for national security. One way or the other we're gonna get it,” Trump told Congress during an address last week. 

Those comments directly oppose those of Nielsen, who during Tuesday's vote told NBC News international partner Sky News that he wanted the vote to send “a clear message to him that we are not for sale.” 

“We don't want to be Americans. No, we don't want to be Danes. We want to be Greenlanders. And we want our own independence in the future. And we want to build our own country by ourselves, not with his hope,” Nielsen added.

But the White House may have found a kindred spirit in the main independence party, Naleraq. Social media influencer and Naleraq candidate Qupanuk Olsen previously told Reuters that “I strongly believe all this interest from Trump and the rest of the world is definitely speeding up our independence process times 100.” 

Speaking about Trump at an election watch party in Nuuk on Tuesday, Naleraq party member Kuno Fencker told Reuters that “he respects our right to self-determination. ... If he wants to invest in Greenland, he is absolutely welcome to do that.”

While the vast majority of Greenlanders support independence, they remain opposed to Trump's overtures, according to a January poll commissioned by the Danish newspaper Berlingske and Greenlandic daily Sermitsiaq. 

Even so, analysts say that the secessionist platforms of both parties may create an opening for greater U.S. influence.

The two parties will likely “try to get more investments” out of America's interest in the island, Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen, an associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College, told NBC News before the vote on Monday.

“A big victory for the Naleraq Party will be seen as a victory for Donald Trump,” he added.

Former Prime Minister Múte Egede called an early election in February amid Trump's comments that acquiring Greenland was vital to security interests. 

“We are in the midst of a serious time. A time we have never experienced in our country,” he said at the time in a post on Facebook.

When news that his party had secured the largest voting share began to filter through, Nielsen said at an event in Nuuk that “people want change. ... We want more business to finance our welfare,” according to Reuters.

The key difference between the two parties is that Naleraq's main goal is rapid independence from Denmark, Dwayne Menezes, managing director of the London-based think tank Polar Research and Policy Initiative, told NBC News in a statement Wednesday. ""For Demokraatit, it is more of an end goal,” he added. 

Bolstered by American interest in mineral wealth, Naleraq has pushed for a referendum in the next four years and aims to strike a secessionist deal with Copenhagen. 

With a coalition not yet agreed upon, the impact of the vote remains unclear for both the Trump administration and Greenland's 56,000 citizens.

The US is set to introduce a 30-day ceasefire proposal negotiated with Ukraine to Russia in the coming days.

Trump administration officials are seeing it as a major breakthrough towards the foreign policy goals of a president who campaigned to end the war.

So does it make a ceasefire plausible? And if so, can it end the war after Russia's full-scale invasion three years ago in a just and sustainable way, and on terms that keep the region and the world safe?

Statement: ""Ukraine expressed readiness to accept the U.S. proposal to enact an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire, which can be extended by mutual agreement of the parties, and which is subject to acceptance and concurrent implementation by the Russian Federation. The United States will communicate to Russia that Russian reciprocity is the key to achieving peace.""

Analysis: The key word here is ""immediate,"" which doesn't leave any doubt: Trump wants the guns to fall silent now. His sense of urgency, however, has often led to concerns in Europe. 

Many fear that rushing the desired outcome without first working out the terms takes the military pressure off Moscow as the invading power and could lead to a truce being exploited. 

They argue it empowers the occupying force. 

The fear is of ultimately leading Ukraine into an effective surrender. The theory is that Russia - the bigger, more populous and militarily more self-sufficient power - could use a truce without first establishing concessions to consolidate its forces, string out a negotiation process and wait to see what happens politically for Trump during his term while it holds on to everything it seized; and even then try to take more ground, building on its current occupation and potentially using a fracture in the Western alliance to threaten more of Europe. 

The process of negotiating terms before a ceasefire in conflicts can be important to ensure the sides convert current military threats into meaningful strategic gains. 

Zelensky has previously tried to persuade the Americans that Russian President Vladimir Putin cannot be trusted, evidenced by the fact he broke the European-backed Minsk agreements after seizing Ukrainian territory in 2014. 

Trump dismisses these concerns, saying there will be security for Ukraine, but without saying how this will be assured. He has said Putin will be deterred and is in a difficult position with ""no choice"" but to make a deal for reasons that ""only I know"". 

Rubio said on Tuesday the US delegation had substantive discussions with the Ukrainians on a permanent end to the war, including ""what type of guarantees they're going to have for their long-term security and prosperity"", but again didn't elaborate.

Statement: ""The United States will immediately lift the pause on intelligence sharing and resume security assistance to Ukraine.""

Analysis: This is the big win for Zelensky in this agreement and sees US weapons supplies being delivered at a rate of around $2bn (£1.5bn)-worth a month, restored. 

Critically, it also means Washington will once again share its intelligence data and satellite pictures with Kyiv, which helps it target Russian positions. The White House said it suspended this aid because it felt Zelensky wasn't ""committed"" to Trump's peace plan. 

The Ukrainian leader had tried to voice his concerns based on some of the reasons above when he was ejected from the Oval Office. His reservations are likely being set aside while he welcomes the agreement in this form - a necessary price to pay to restore US security assistance.

Statement: ""Both delegations agreed to name their negotiating teams and immediately begin negotiations toward an enduring peace that provides for Ukraine's long-term security. The United States committed to discussing these specific proposals with representatives from Russia. The Ukrainian delegation reiterated that European partners shall be involved in the peace process.""

Analysis: This paragraph is confusing because it's unclear whether it refers to negotiations between Ukraine and the US on establishing any security guarantees for Ukraine, or if it refers to negotiations between Ukraine and Russia to permanently end the war once a ceasefire is under way. 

If it is the former, it appears to suggest that Washington and Kyiv will hammer out any decisions on how to back up Ukraine's security and deter Russian breaches of a truce, and the US will then discuss these with Moscow. 

But it is all a far cry from the kind of security guarantee Zelensky ultimately wanted, which was membership of Nato, which Trump has said won't happen - a major long-term concession to Moscow's demands. 

The paragraph also contains a vague and lukewarm reference to the idea of European peacekeepers, which have been pitched by the UK and France, with the line attributed only to the Ukrainian delegation. 

It's notable that the US appears not to be putting its name to this part after Moscow categorically rejected the idea.

Statement: ""…both countries' presidents agreed to conclude as soon as possible a comprehensive agreement for developing Ukraine's critical mineral resources to expand Ukraine's economy and guarantee Ukraine's long-term prosperity and security.""

Analysis: This was the agreement that never got signed after Zelensky was told to leave the White House last month. 

It would give the US a future stake in some of Ukraine's state-owned mineral deposits, as well as oil and gas revenues. 

Trump sees it as an effective security guarantee for Ukraine, arguing it would deter Russian re-invasion because American companies would be on the ground. 

Opponents point out this is meaningless because US economic presence in Ukraine didn't deter Putin in 2014 or 2022.

Statement: ""The Ukrainian delegation reiterated the Ukrainian people's strong gratitude to President Trump…""

Analysis: This is a key line that might help explain Zelenky's rehabilitation in the eyes of the White House. 

Vance had castigated him in the Oval Office for not thanking Trump, even though the Ukrainian leader has thanked the US dozens of times for its military support. 

Now Trump has an official Ukrainian thank you, on a piece of paper meant to make peace.

The US president also accuses the EU of treating the US ""very badly"" as the tariff tit-for-tat continues. 

The Columbia University graduate had a key role in student protests over Gaza. Trump said his arrest was the first of ""many to come"". 

Mahmoud Khalil, a US permanent resident, participated in protests against the war in Gaza at Columbia University in New York. 

Cutbacks have been announced at the department, which the US president has pledged to eliminate altogether.

As the president tries to force Mexico to stop the flow of drugs, cartel members tell Quentin Sommerville they will not be deterred.

Over the past week, Panama's government has released dozens of migrants from around the world who were deported from the U.S. The migrants fled conflict, religious persecution, poverty and government crackdowns in countries such as Afghanistan, Somalia, Cameroon, China, Pakistan and Iran

They Crossed the World to Reach the US. Now Deported Under Trump, They're Stuck in Panama

PANAMA CITY (AP) — They crossed oceans to get to the U.S., fleeing conflict, religious persecution, poverty and government crackdowns in countries such as Afghanistan, Somalia, Cameroon, China, Pakistan and Iran.

After flying to Central and South America, they bused through countries where they didn't speak the language and walked through unfamiliar jungle to get to the U.S.-Mexico border.

Within days, they were detained and put on military aircraft that flew nearly 300 of them to Panama as U.S. President Donald Trump sought to accelerate deportations to more complicated destinations.

Panama was supposed to be a stopover. But for those unwilling to return home — mostly out of well-founded fear — Panama sent them to a guarded camp without access to lawyers in the same Darién jungle many had crossed months earlier on their way north.

Over the past week, under legal pressure, the Panamanian government dropped them off at a bus station in the capital with 30 days to figure out where they will go next. 

“It feels like the whole world is crushing down on me. It's like everything is stopping,” said Isha Len, a 29-year-old from Cameroon. “I risked everything, my life, everything, crossing the Darién Gap, just to be sent back.”

Here are the stories that some of the deportees told The Associated Press:



  Isha Len, 29, Cameroon 
 

After conflict broke out in her small town, Len crossed Cameroon by car and minibus, then a fisherman friend carried her four hours by boat to Nigeria. 

Len, a schoolteacher, flew to Sao Paulo, Brazil, where she said authorities detained her for a month in the airport. From there, she wound north through South America by bus, following other migrants until they reached the Darién Gap.

READ:  

She walked days through the dangerous jungle that divides Colombia and Panama before boarding buses that carried her through Central America. After being kidnapped for days by a gang in Guatemala, she crossed into southern Mexico, where she took a boat along the Pacific coast to evade authorities. After she landed, she rode eight hours to Mexico City, continuing on by bus and car to Tijuana. 

She crossed the U.S. border and presented herself to American authorities.



  Artemis Ghasemzadeh, 27, Iran 
 

Artemis Ghasemzadeh left her country in January, fleeing after converting from Islam to Christianity – something that could cost Ghasemzadeh her life in Iran. She flew to Dubai, where she stayed two weeks and then took a flight to South Korea. 

From there she flew to Mexico City, staying there for three weeks before going to Tijuana. She crossed the U.S. border on Feb. 9, and was detained for five days, including her birthday.

“For changing your religion, your punishment is death,"" she said. “We don't know what will happen.""



  Wang Qiu, 53, China
 

Wang Qiu said he left home after he was imprisoned for three years for speaking out about democracy and human rights issues. 

He flew from Beijing to Cuba, then to the small South American country of Suriname. From there, he traveled by land: through Guyana, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia, before trekking through the Darién Gap. 

He moved up through Central America and Mexico before being detained after crossing into the U.S. in San Diego.



  Qamar Abdi, 19, Somalia
 

Qamar Abdi, left for the U.S. on Aug. 17, due to warfare between the government and militants of al-Shabab, which the U.S. recognizes as a terrorist group. 

She hopped from buses to shared cars for nearly a month until she reached South Africa. From there, she flew to Sao Paulo, Brazil, and spent the next six months riding buses north. 

When she arrived at the northern tip of Colombia, she traveled six days through the Darién Gap, landing in Panama on New Year's Day. 

She took buses to the southern Mexican border city of Tapachula, where she was temporarily kidnapped and robbed by a gang. To avoid immigration authorities, she traveled hours packed on a boat with other migrants along Mexico's Pacific coast, then took a bus to Mexico City. She spent two weeks there before driving to Tijuana, where she crossed into the U.S.



  Ebrahim Ghezelgechi, 36, Iran
 

Ebrahim Ghezelgechi fled Iran with his wife, Sahar; 10-year-old daughter, Aylin; and 11-year-old son, Sam, on Nov. 21. 

The family flew to Brazil, then to Panama and finally Nicaragua. From there, they took buses north to Guatemala, then crossed into southern Mexico by boat. They road on top of trains and in buses and vans to get to Tijuana. 

After Mexico authorities sent them back to the southern part of the country, they took a plane to the resort area of Los Cabos. There, they were detained, had their passports taken and were sent back south again. 

They tried getting north a number of times, punted back by Mexican authorities, before eventually paying a driver to take them to Tijuana. 

After crossing into the U.S., they were detained in San Diego for a week.



  Samin Haider, 21, Pakistan
 

Samin Haider left for Dubai in 2023 after violence surged in his region of Parachinar, which borders Afghanistan and has been plagued for decades by conflicts between Shi'ite and Sunni Muslim communities. 

Haider was there for 1 1/2 years before the United Arab Emirates canceled visas for Pakistanis. 

Haider then flew to Mexico and traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border with the hopes of seeking asylum. 

Now deported to Panama, he still hopes to reach the U.S.



  Elham Ghaedi, 29, Iran 
 

Elham Ghaedi left on Oct. 21, flying to Brazil and then to Venezuela's capital Caracas. 

She traveled to Colombia, where took a bus north and then walked five days through the Darién Gap. 

She stayed 15 days in a migrant camp in southern Panama before taking a bus through Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and to Mexico's southern border. There, migration authorities detained her for six days.

She traveled north to Mexico City, where she spent a month, before boarding a flight to Tijuana. U.S. authorities detained her when she crossed to San Diego.



  Hayatullah Omagh, 29, Afghanistan
 

Omagh fled Afghanistan in 2022 after the takeover of the Taliban because he identified as an atheist and was part of an ethnic minority, something that could put his life in danger. 

He first went to Pakistan, where he got a visa for six months, and struggled to get a new one due to his Afghani passport. 

He then went to Iran and worked there for 1 1/2 years. But the country wouldn't accept him as a refugee. 

He managed to get a visa to Brazil, which offered a number of Afghan people refuge after the rise of the Taliban, and flew to Sao Paulo in 2024.

Hoping to reunite with friends and family in the U.S., Omagh paid smugglers to move him north through Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia. He trekked through the Darién Gap, then took buses north through Central America to southern Mexico. 

Mexican authorities detained him and dropped him back in southern Mexico a few times before he managed to take a flight to Mexico City and later to the U.S., where he was detained. 

“After so much time, I've lost hope,” he said.

The administration of US president Donald Trump continues to introduce polices that strip the government's support of US science, as Peter Gwynne reports

Two months into Donald Trump's second presidency and many parts of US science – across government, academia, and industry – continue to be hit hard by the new administration's policies. Science-related government agencies are seeing budgets and staff cut, especially in programmes linked to climate change and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is also causing havoc as it seeks to slash spending.

In mid-February, DOGE fired more than 300 employees at the National Nuclear Safety Administration, which is part of the US Department of Energy, many of whom were responsible for reassembling nuclear warheads at the Pantex plant in Texas. A day later, the agency was forced to rescind all but 28 of the sackings amid concerns that their absence could jeopardise national security. 

A judge has also reinstated workers who were laid off at the National Science Foundation (NSF) as well as at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The judge said the government's Office of Personnel Management, which sacked the staff, did not have the authority to do so. However, the NSF rehiring applies mainly to military veterans and staff with disabilities, with the overall workforce down by about 140 people – or roughly 10%.

The NSF has also announced a reduction, the size of which is unknown, in its Research Experiences for Undergraduates programme. Over the last 38 years, the initiative has given thousands of college students – many with backgrounds that are underrepresented in science – the opportunity to carry out original research at  institutions during the summer holidays. NSF staff are also reviewing thousands of grants containing such words as “women” and “diversity”.

NASA, meanwhile, is to shut its office of technology, policy and strategy, along with its chief-scientist office, and the DEI and accessibility branch of its diversity and equal opportunity office. “I know this news is difficult and may affect us all differently,” admitted acting administrator Janet Petro in an all-staff e-mail. Affecting about 20 staff, the move is on top of plans to reduce NASA's overall workforce. Reports also suggest that NASA's science budget could be slashed by as much as 50%.

Hundreds of “probationary employees” have also been sacked by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which provides weather forecasts that are vital for farmers and people in areas threatened by tornadoes and hurricanes. “If there were to be large staffing reductions at NOAA there will be people who die in extreme weather events and weather-related disasters who would not have otherwise,” warns climate scientist Daniel Swain from the University of California, Los Angeles.

In his first cabinet meeting on 26 February, Trump suggested that officials “use scalpels” when trimming their departments' spending and personnel – rather than Musk's figurative chainsaw. But bosses at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) still plan to cut its budget by about two-thirds. “[W]e fear that such cuts would render the agency incapable of protecting Americans from grave threats in our air, water, and land,” wrote former EPA administrators William Reilly, Christine Todd Whitman and Gina McCarthy in the New York Times.

The White House's attack on climate science goes beyond just the EPA. In January, the US Department of Agriculture removed almost all data on climate change from its website. The action resulted in a lawsuit in March from the Northeast Organic Farming Association of New York and two non-profit organizations – the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Working Group. They say that the removal hinders research and “agricultural decisions”.

The Trump administration has also barred NASA's now former chief scientist Katherine Calvin and members of the State Department from travelling to China for a planning meeting of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Meanwhile, in a speech to African energy ministers in Washington on 7 March, US energy secretary Chris Wright claimed that coal has “transformed our world and made it better”, adding that climate change, while real, is not on his list of the world's top 10 problems. “We've had years of Western countries shamelessly saying ‘don't develop coal',” he said. “That's just nonsense.”

US science in chaos as impact of Trump's executive orders sinks in




US science in chaos as impact of Trump's executive orders sinks in

At the National Institutes of Health (NIH), staff are being told to cancel hundreds of research grants that involve DEI and transgender issues. The Trump administration also wants to cut the allowance for indirect costs of NIH's and other agencies' research grants to 15% of research contracts, although a district court judge has put that move on hold pending further legal arguments. On 8 March, the Trump administration also threatened to cancel $400m in funding to Columbia purportedly due to its failure to tackle anti-semitism on the campus.

A Trump policy of removing “undocumented aliens” continues to alarm universities that have overseas students. Some institutions have already advised overseas students against travelling abroad during holidays, in case immigration officers do not let them back in when they return. Others warn that their international students should carry their immigration documents with them at all times. Universities have also started to rein in spending with Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for example, implementing a hiring freeze.

Amid the turmoil, the US scientific community is beginning to fight back. Individual scientists have supported court cases that have overturned sackings at government agencies, while a letter to Congress signed by the Union of Concerned Scientists and 48 scientific societies asserts that the administration has “already caused significant harm to American science”. On 7 March, more than 30 US cities also hosted “Stand Up for Science” rallies attended by thousands of demonstrators.

Elsewhere, a group of government, academic and industry leaders – known collectively as Vision for American Science and Technology – has released a report warning that the US could fall behind China and other competitors in science and technology. Entitled Unleashing American Potential, it calls for increased public and private investment in science to maintain US leadership. “The more dollars we put in from the feds, the more investment comes in from industry, and we get job growth, we get economic success, and we get national security out of it,” notes Sudip Parikh, chief executive of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, who was involved in the report.

Marcia McNutt, president of the National Academy of Sciences, meanwhile, has called on the community to continue to highlight the benefit of science. “We need to underscore the fact that stable federal funding of research is the main mode by which radical new discoveries have come to light – discoveries that have enabled the age of quantum computing and AI and new materials science,” she said. “These are areas that I am sure are very important to this administration as well.”

Donald Trump has said ""it's up to Russia now"" as he urged Vladimir Putin to agree to a 30-day ceasefire with Ukraine. Earlier, the Kremlin said it was studying the proposal but would not agree to anything until it had heard from the US. Follow the latest here.

Live reporting by Adam McGroarty

Vladimir Putin will look to respond with a demand of his own to the ceasefire proposal, his former adviser has said.

Speaking to our chief presenter Mark Austin, Sergei Markov said: ""Russia is afraid that the ceasefire period would be used by NATO countries for the full militarisation of the Ukrainian society.""

He said Putin will therefore likely demand a weapon embargo for the supplying of the Ukrainian army from other countries.

But when asked about the prospect of peacekeeping forces being planned by European countries, Markov began to laugh at the idea.

He claimed British and French troops are ""part of the war"" and said peacekeepers are usually from neutral countries.

""All troops from European countries would be regarded as occupation troops, and all of them would be killed by Russian soldiers who would come to liberate Ukraine,"" Markov said.

But things got heated when he was pushed as to whether Russia would treat UK peacekeeping soldiers as the enemy and participants of the war.

""Yes, because Britain is a participant of the war,"" Markov said - referencing the military aid given to Ukraine by the UK.

With Donald Trump confirming a US delegation is travelling to Russia (see 4.17pm post), we have now heard that his national security adviser Mike Waltz spoke to his Russian counterpart today.  

Waltz was at the Saudi talks with Ukrainian officials yesterday.

It comes after Russia said it would not decide on the US-proposed Ukraine ceasefire until it hears from the Americans (see 9.49am post).

The defence ministers of France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the UK are meeting in Paris to discuss support for Ukraine - and they're holding a news conference now.

French defence minister Sebastien Lecornu has said around 15 countries have expressed an interest in discussing security for Ukraine.

Meanwhile, German defence minister Boris Pistorius called for long-term peace as he said the ceasefire was the right step to take.

Watch the news conference in the stream below.

For weeks it seemed like Vladimir Putin had Donald Trump's ear, but all of a sudden he's now on the end of the US president's demands, our Moscow correspondent Ivor Bennett says.

Trump is already applying pressure on Moscow to agree to the 30-day ceasefire proposal, Bennett says, noting Trump's comments about things in a ""financial sense"" that could be ""very bad for Russia"" - comments that imply a fresh round of sanctions could be on the way.

Turning to Steve Witkoff's widely anticipated visit to Moscow this week, Bennett says Trump's Middle East envoy will present the US ceasefire proposal to Putin, but questions whether he will be successful.

""It's a difficult one to call because, as we know, Russia doesn't like to be put into a corner or have decisions made for it. 

""But at the same time, I don't think Putin wants to jeopardise relations with the US. So a lot for him to think about.""

More to bring you now from Donald Trump - who has continued to address the US proposal of a 30-day ceasefire after welcoming the world's media into the Oval Office.

The US president says ""we have a very complex situation solved on one side, pretty much solved"" after talks with Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia yesterday.

He says ""we've discussed a lot of the details"" including the areas of land involved in the proposed deal, but insists ""we don't want to be wasting time"".

""People are dying... as we're sitting here, you probably had two people die on that very open field, it's dead flat, great farmland and it's dead flat,"" he adds.

""There's no protection, the only thing that stops a bullet is a human body and these bodies are young people.""

Trump describes the situation as a ""disaster"" and says ""I hope he [Putin] is going to have a ceasefire"".

Sitting in front of the cameras in the Oval Office just now, Donald Trump said ""we have people going to Russia right now"".

Only one man has been trusted to head up his envoy to Moscow, and he's far from the typical diplomat.

Initially named as Trump's Middle East envoy shortly after the US election, Steve Witkoff has since been involved in negotiations with Russia about ending the war in Ukraine.

His surprise trip to Moscow last month to achieve the release of US citizen Marc Fogel seemed to secure the 67-year-old as the US leader's geopolitical dealmaker-in-chief...

Read our profile of Witkoff here:

Since the US proposal of a 30-day ceasefire was raised in talks with Ukrainian officials yesterday, the big question on the lips of analysts has been whether Russia would accept the plans.

That is something US senator Lindsey Graham says he remains ""extremely sceptical"" about.

He says ""it is clear"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy is willing to make peace, and repeated Marco Rubio's statement that the ball is now in Russia's court.

""Zelenskyy has passed the test of wanting peace. It is now up to Putin to show his cards,"" Graham says.

He goes on to say he will be introducing ""bone-breaking sanctions and tariffs against Russia before the end of the week"" in order to move towards peace.

""If they do not pursue the ceasefire with the same vigour as Ukraine, there will be hell to pay,"" he adds.

Away from the White House, the UK has summoned its Russian ambassador as the diplomatic spat between the countries deepens.

It says it is clear that Russia is trying to drive the British embassy in Moscow towards closure, and adds it is revoking accreditation for a Russian diplomat and their spouse.

It comes in response to Russia expelling a British diplomat and their spouse earlier this week.

'The depths to which Russia sinks can only be met through strength'

In a statement, the Foreign Office said: ""We do not take this decision lightly, but we have always made clear to Russia that if they escalate, we will take reciprocal action. The depths to which Russia sinks can only be met through strength.

""Despite the extremely difficult bilateral relations caused by Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine and long-running campaign of hostile action against the UK, the UK Government believes that maintaining diplomatic channels of communication, and our respective diplomatic missions, is important. 

""It is deeply disappointing that this is continually made more difficult by unprovoked action from Russia. 

""We have drawn a line under this incident and demand Russia do the same. Any further action taken by Russia will be considered an escalation and responded to accordingly.""

Donald Trump is hosting Ireland's prime minister at the White House - and with the world's media assembled he isn't missing out on a chance to discuss key issues.

He says the US has received ""some positive messages"" after its proposal of a ceasefire at talks with Ukraine in Saudi Arabia yesterday.

""Hopefully we can get a ceasefire,"" he tells reporters, adding ""it is up to Russia now"".

The US president also says ""we have people going to Russia right now"" - following reports his Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff will travel to Moscow this week.

That comes after the Kremlin said it will not decide on the US-proposed ceasefire until it hears from the Americans (see 9.49am post).

But Trump also had a warning for Russia, saying ""there are things you could do in a financial sense that would be very bad for Russia"".

More now on the situation in Kursk - which we've been reporting on throughout the day.

Videos geolocated by Sky News show Russian forces swiftly advancing on the key town of Sudzha on its southern border. 

More than 10 videos show Russian soldiers destroying bridges and recapturing villages, before moving into Sudzha and planting a Russian flag in the centre. 

Ukraine took control of Sudzha during the Kursk offensive in August 2024 in just under two weeks.

Now, in a matter of days, Russian forces have reclaimed the centre of the town.

The map below shows the locations of Russian troops in and around Sudzha that Sky News has verified. The orange dots show Russian troops and advances, and the grey dots show the former positions of Ukrainian troops. 

Ukrainian troops seen fleeing

Sudzha is situated just north of the border to Ukraine in Kursk and had a pre-invasion population of more than 5,000 people. 

The footage we found shows Russian forces closing in on the town by striking surrounding villages and Ukrainian military equipment.  

On 11 March, footage showed large groups of Ukrainian troops pulling back from the centre of Sudzha on foot.  

A day later, Russian forces could be seen posing in the town, holding the flags of the Russian Federation and the Wagner Group.

Our goal: to leave no breach of freedom of information unreported. Discover our world press freedom ranking, our latest investigation reports as well as our publications produced every day by our regional offices, in connection with our network of correspondents in 115 countries around the world.

To make a lasting change, we carry out in-depth work with governments and institutions. We offer concrete solutions and launch international initiatives. We are on the ground to assist journalists in danger. Anywhere and anytime.

Do you believe there can be no freedom of conscience without freedom of the press? Do you want to help free and independent journalism, and those who embody it? Do you want to defend the right to information? There are several ways to support RSF: find the one that suits you and join the fight!

Go behind the scenes of RSF and discover in detail our operations, our teams, our funding, our governance… but also our favourite picks, partners, projects and events we support and who act in their own way to advance our commmon ideal.

Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has restored access to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) website in countries where it has previously been censored, through its Collateral Freedom mirroring project. The initiative to unblock access to one of the world's most important news organizations marks a significant step in RSF's fight against online censorship.

The BBC's online services have been blocked for years in countries like China, Iran and Russia, and to a lesser extent in Vietnam and Turkmenistan. RSF has deployed cutting-edge technology to bypass government-imposed restrictions, ensuring that millions of people around the world can once again access the broadcaster's independent journalism online.In 2023, RSF created a mirror website for BBC Persian, the BBC's farsi service  Since then, the project has expanded to included the entire BBC website in 43 languages, mirrored and accessible through this link.

“By harnessing innovative technology to deploy mirror sites, we ensure that vital, independent journalism remains accessible even in the most repressive digital environments. Collateral Freedom is not only about bypassing censorship—it's about safeguarding the fundamental right to information for everyone, everywhere.

“The drastic reduction in press freedom and increase in interference in distribution means it's even tougher for audiences to access independent and impartial news in some countries. All audiences around the world should be able to access BBC News services. By working with RSF, we are able to provide the tools needed to circumvent the severe restrictions on free media.

Collateral Freedom is an anti-censorship operation that leverages the use of mirror sites – real-time exact replicas of censored websites hosted on content delivery networks (CDNs). The method of unblocking requires no installation of additional applications.  

A growth of 56% media mirrored in twelve months

With a 56% increase in mirrored media since 2024, RSF continues to expand its efforts to counter online censorship and safeguard press freedom worldwide, allowing 156 media outlets to still reach their audiences despite censorship. The list of unblocked sites is available on the operation's GitHub page, except where security concerns require media outlets to remain discreet.

In July 2024, RSF expanded its efforts by creating mirror sites for several European media outlets censored in Russia, including the Franco-German public service channel Arte. In 2024-2025, websites blocked on Chinese network were also mirrored by RSF such as the Taiwanese media New Bloom, an online magazine covering activism in Taiwan, and Canadian organisation Citizen Lab, a pioneer in forensic analysis of spyware, which back in 2017 denounced the use of Pegasus spyware to spy on journalists.

Your donations enable RSF to keep working. We depend on you in order to be able to monitor respect for press freedom and take action worldwide.

Media freedom is a fundamental right, but nearly half of the world's population has no access to freely reported news and information.
We need you. Join our organisation!

The European Union on Wednesday announced retaliatory trade action with new duties on U.S. industrial and farm products, responding within hours to the Trump administration's increase in tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25 per cent.

The world's biggest trading bloc was expecting the U.S. tariffs and prepared in advance, but the measures still place great strain on already tense transatlantic relations. Only last month, Washington warned Europe that it would have to take care of its own security in the future.

The EU measures will cover goods from the United States worth some 26 billion euros ($40 billion Cdn) — and not just steel and aluminum products. Textiles, home appliances, agricultural goods will be hit with tariffs, as will motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans, the latter of which were also taxed during U.S. President Donald Trump's first term.

The EU duties aim for pressure points in the U.S. while minimizing additional damage to Europe. The tariffs — taxes on imports — primarily target Republican-held states, hitting soybeans in House Speaker Mike Johnson's Louisiana, and also beef and poultry in Kansas and Nebraska. Produce in Alabama, Georgia and Virginia is also on the list.

The European Commission, which manages trade and commercial conflicts on behalf of the 27 EU member countries, said leather goods and agricultural products beyond beef and poultry would be hit, including some seafood, nuts, eggs, sugar and vegetables.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement that the bloc ""will always remain open to negotiation.""

""As the U.S. are applying tariffs worth 28 billion dollars, we are responding with countermeasures worth 26 billion euros,"" she said. ""We firmly believe that in a world fraught with geopolitical and economic uncertainties, it is not in our common interest to burden our economies with tariffs.""

Trudeau seeks closer ties, trade with European allies also targeted by Trump

Trump said his taxes would help create U.S. factory jobs, but von der Leyen said: ""Jobs are at stake. Prices will go up. In Europe and in the United States.""

""We deeply regret this measure. Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business and even worse for consumers. These tariffs are disrupting supply chains. They bring uncertainty for the economy,"" she said.

The American Chamber of Commerce to the EU said the U.S. tariffs and EU countermeasures ""will only harm jobs, prosperity and security on both sides of the Atlantic.""

""The two sides must de-escalate and find a negotiated outcome urgently,"" the chamber said Wednesday.

Trump slapped similar tariffs on EU steel and aluminum during his first term in office, which enraged European and other allies. The EU also imposed countermeasures in retaliation at the time.

This time, the EU action will involve two steps. First, on April 1, the commission will reintroduce what it calls ""rebalancing measures,"" which the EU had from 2018 and 2020 but were then suspended under the Biden administration. Then on April 13 come the additional duties targeting 18 billion euros ($19.6 billion) in U.S. exports to the bloc.

What does Trump really want?

EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic travelled to Washington last month in an effort to head off the tariffs, meeting with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and other top trade officials.

He said on Wednesday that it became clear during the trip ""that the EU is not the problem.""

""I argued to avoid the unnecessary burden of measures and countermeasures, but you need a partner for that. You need both hands to clap,"" Sefcovic told reporters at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France.

The EU could lose up to 3.7 million tons of steel exports, according to the European steel association Eurofer. The U.S. is the second-biggest export market for EU steel producers, representing 16 per cent of the total EU steel exports.

The EU estimates that annual trade volume between both sides stands at about $1.5 trillion US, representing some 30 per cent of global trade. While the bloc has a substantial export surplus in goods, it says that is partly offset by the U.S. surplus in the trade of services.

Britain, which isn't part of the EU, meanwhile said it won't impose retaliatory measures of its own on the U.S.

WASHINGTON—Joe Biden held himself out as the most climate-friendly president ever to hold office, but relished his gas-guzzling Corvette Stingray. President Trump wants to drill-baby-drill and, on Tuesday, was in the market for an electric vehicle.

 Like everything else in Washington these days, the politics of car ownership has turned upside-down.  Trump didn't just want any electric vehicle. He was on a mission to purchase a Tesla—a sop to his adviser Elon Musk, who happens to be the car company's chief executive. The decision came after Trump campaigned extensively against Biden's electric vehicle mandates.  The Tesla was “the most Democratic car make by a longshot,” according to a 2023 analysis of consumer data by Mike Shannon and Will Feltus published in Fortune Magazine. Democratic strongholds of San Francisco, Denver, Honolulu and Los Angeles had the highest concentration of Tesla owners, they found. But the car got a Republican pitchman at Trump's photo-op on Tuesday, where several models were parked on the White House grounds for the president to inspect. Holding notes that detailed the prices of each model, the president expounded on the virtues of Musk's vehicles. President Trump holds a list showing the pricing of various Tesla models.Others on the White House staff own Telsas, including communications director Steven Cheung, who confirmed that he owns a Model X. Trump's event was an attempt at correcting what he sees as a wrong: Musk's alignment with Trump's White House and efforts to slash the size of the federal government are causing problems for the brand. Protesters have picketed Tesla showrooms across the country and some liberals have boycotted the brand. Tesla's stock had its worst day since 2020 on Monday, tumbling by 15%. The stock made up some ground on Tuesday. The scene Tuesday was notable in other ways: It showed the most powerful man in the world lending support to the richest man in the world. Other presidents have used cars as props—though not to prop up the fortunes of their staff. As vice president, Joe Biden drove his beloved 1967 Corvette around government-controlled grounds for a segment with comedian Jay Leno. “I like speed,” said Biden, grinning as he shift gears. “I've always liked to drive.” As president, Biden was more on message, driving an electric Ford F-150 to highlight support for EVs. “This sucker's quick” Biden said in May 2021 as he pulled up to a group of reporters, saying that he could imagine buying one of the cars. On Tuesday at the White House, a silver Cybertruck glistened in the sun for the president to inspect. But Trump folded his 6-foot-3-inch frame into a red Tesla sedan with Musk standing nearby. “Watch the Secret Service go crazy,” Trump said. “If you actually drove it around, it would really be wild,” Musk observed, and then entered the vehicle on the passenger side. “Wow. That's beautiful,” Trump gushed as he appraised a computer panel near the steering wheel. He didn't drive the car, but he said it was the one he would purchase.

 THE NEW administration in America is determined to slash foreign-aid budgets. The cuts to health aid have already interrupted essential services around the world, from antiretroviral therapy for HIV to tracking infectious diseases and providing care to newborns and their mothers. Some of the cuts are the subject of legal challenges, but the broad consequences are already emerging. Which countries will be most affected?  Analysis by the Centre for Global Development (CGD), a think-tank based in Washington, DC and London, found that American aid is equivalent to 10% of the government's health spending in 37 countries. In ten of them it is equivalent to more than half (see map). The Trump administration's cuts highlight that many countries have become over-reliant on America and other aid donors to support basic health functions. The CGD identified 26 countries that will suffer most, because of their reliance on American aid coupled with their low income levels and high risk of being unable to meet their financial obligations (see chart). In Afghanistan, for example, American health aid is the equivalent of almost 350% of the government's health spending. As a poor country at high risk of debt distress, Afghanistan will struggle to replace American aid. A combination of political instability, poverty and low domestic health spending have created this dependency. There are no obvious alternatives to replace American aid in full. European countries are also slashing foreign-aid budgets in order to boost defence spending. Philanthropic organisations don't have enough cash to replace government aid budgets. China sees a “pretty big opportunity” to forge alliances, says Daniel Thornton, of the World Health Organisation. China's vaccine diplomacy during the pandemic combined humanitarian goals with geopolitical ones. Providing finance for critical programmes that America has cut off could now give it another soft-power advantage. Still, China's contributions to global health assistance are relatively small—at $783m in 2023 compared with America's $12.4bn. One clear message from the crisis is the need for countries to restructure their health systems so that they are less reliant on political whims abroad or the priorities of any single donor. Mr Thornton says there is also an opportunity to provide many services more cheaply than those that have been offered by American companies, which implement many of the country's foreign-aid programmes. An old saying holds that from crisis comes opportunity. Unfortunately, a deadly period of adjustment will come first.

 By Mark Trevelyan 

 -Ukrainian troops appeared on the point of losing their hard-won foothold inside Russia's Kursk region on Wednesday as Moscow claimed further advances there and military bloggers on both sides said Kyiv's forces were withdrawing. 

 Ukraine sprang one of the biggest shocks of the war on August 6 last year by storming across the border and grabbing a chunk of land inside Russia, boosting citizens' morale and gaining a potential bargaining chip. 

 But after clinging for more than seven months to a gradually shrinking area, Ukraine has seen its position worsen sharply in the past week. 

 Russia's defence ministry on Wednesday reported the capture of five more villages, and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that ""the dynamics are good"". 

 Reuters was able to verify video published by Russian bloggers and state media showing troops standing with a Russian tricolour flag on a square in the centre of Sudzha, a town near the Ukrainian border on a highway used by Ukraine as a supply route. 

 Deep State, an authoritative Ukrainian site that charts the frontlines of the war, updated its battlefield map to show Ukrainian forces were no longer in control of Sudzha. However, it said fighting was continuing on the outskirts. 

 A Ukrainian military spokesperson declined to comment. 

 Ukraine's top commander denied this week that his forces were being encircled, but said they were taking up better defensive positions. 

 Skadovskyi Defender, a Ukrainian military blogger, posted on Telegram: ""Ukraine's Armed Forces are leaving Kursk. There will be no Ukrainian soldier there by Friday."" 

 The same channel said, however, that Ukraine was continuing to conduct heavy strikes on Sudzha. 

 The Russian governor of the region said four civilian employees of a feed mill had been killed northeast of Sudzha on Wednesday. 

 Reuters could not verify the accounts from either side because of reporting restrictions. 

 Independent Russian analyst Ruslan Leviev said the Ukrainian incursion was drawing to a close. 

 ""Maybe this story will end today. Maybe they will try to hold the border villages for another couple of days. But overall, the story of the Kursk bridgehead is coming to an end, and Ukrainian troops are leaving,"" he told Dozhd TV. 

 Ukraine agreed on Tuesday to a U.S. proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in the war, which has dragged on for more than three years. The Kremlin said it needed to be briefed by the U.S. side before it would comment on whether the ceasefire terms were acceptable.

Cities Face 'Whiplash' of Floods, Droughts as Temperatures Rise, Study Warns

By David Stanway

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The weather in some of the world's most densely populated cities is swinging from droughts to floods and back again as rising temperatures play havoc with the global water cycle, a study commissioned by the charity WaterAid showed on Wednesday.

South and Southeast Asia face the strongest wetting trends, while Europe, the Middle East and North Africa are becoming ever drier, researchers found in a study of 42 years of weather data drawn from more than 100 of the world's most populous cities.

""There will be winners and losers associated with climate change,"" said Michael Singer of the Water Research Institute at Cardiff University, one of the authors of the study. ""It's already happening.""

China's eastern city of Hangzhou and Indonesia's capital of Jakarta topped the list of cities suffering from ""climate whiplash"", or a rapid succession of prolonged floods and droughts, the study showed.

As much as 15% of the cities surveyed also faced the worst of both worlds, with extreme flood and drought risks rising at the same time, among them the Texan city of Dallas, the Chinese commercial hub of Shanghai and Baghdad, the capital of Iraq.

""You can't just assume that every place can have a similar response to atmospheric warming,"" added Singer. ""It doesn't care who you are, whether you're wealthy or poor or you have great infrastructure or not.""

China's coastal city of Hangzhou set a record with more than 60 days of extreme high temperatures last year, and was also hit by severe floods that forced tens of thousands to evacuate.

A fifth of the cities have seen a reversal in climate extremes, with the Sri Lankan capital of Colombo and the Indian financial hub of Mumbai ""flipping"" to become far wetter, while the Egyptian capital of Cairo and Hong Kong are steadily drier.

Many cities that built infrastructure either to maximise scarce water supplies or mitigate flood damage are now facing entirely different circumstances, and will need to invest to adapt, Singer warned.

The few experiencing favourable changes include the Japanese capital of Tokyo, London and China's southern Guangzhou, which had significantly fewer wet and dry months over the period from 2002 to 2023 than in the two prior decades.

Musk's Starlink Could Help Remote Parts of India Get Online Under Deals With Telecoms Players

NEW DELHI (AP) — Elon Musk's Starlink signed an agreement with India's top telecom operator on Wednesday to bring the U.S. satellite internet giant's services to the world's most populous country, a day after announcing a similar agreement with the country's second-largest provider.

The deals with Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel, which together control more than 70% of India's telecom market, could help bring internet connections to millions of people who live in remote areas.

But they depend on Starlink obtaining government approval to enter India. The partnership announcements come weeks after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Musk in Washington.



  Deals will put Starlink devices in stores across India
 

Wednesday's deal will allow Starlink to stock and sell its equipment in Jio's thousands of retail outlets, giving the company direct distribution across India. Starlink will also use its partners' network infrastructure to enhance satellite coverage across India, where a vast population still lacks internet access.

A statement from Jio said Starlink will compliment the Indian telecom giant's broadband services “by extending high-speed internet to the most challenging of locations in a quick and affordable manner.""

Jio will also provide installation and activation support for the Starlink devices, the statement said.



  India has long been out of reach for Musk's companies
 

Jio has long been at odds with Starlink over methods for awarding satellite service spectrum in India.

Jio had urged Indian government to grant spectrum for satellite services through auctions to ensure fair competition, while Musk wanted spectrum to be allocated administratively, in line with global trends. Indian government eventually decided to assign satellite spectrum.

It is unclear whether Starlink's licence application has already been approved, but local media reports suggest it is nearing initial regulatory approval.

Last November, India's telecoms minister, Jyotiraditya Scindia, said Starlink had yet to comply with security norms, and that a license would be issued to the company only after it meets all the requirements.

Yet the biggest challenge Starlink faces in India could be pricing.

Mobile data in India is among the world's cheapest — Ambani's Jio once even gave it for free with mobile plans. 

Tesla, Musk's electric car maker, has also faced hurdles in India due to the country's high import duties on vehicles, but it could be getting a boost as well. The copmany began hiring in India last month and has also signed a lease deal to open its first showroom in Mumbai, according to local news reports.



  Starlink could help India bring millions online in remote areas 
 

At least 40% of the country's more than 1.4 billion people don't have access to the internet. Cheap satellite broadband is needed to bridge this gap, particularly in India's vast remote and mountainous rural areas.

Starlink has at least 6,900 active satellites orbiting Earth that provide low-latency broadband, including to areas where internet previously has been completely unavailable.

 Germany's likely next government under conservative leader Friedrich Merz has said it plans a shot in the arm for the flagging economy with a huge programme of investment in defence and infrastructure. 

 But economists warn that Europe's largest economy will also need structural reforms for a sustainable recovery after two straight years of recession.

 Both Merz's centre-right CDU/CSU and the centre-left SPD, who are in talks on forming a coalition, say that they want to restore industrial competitiveness. 

 Their draft programme includes lowering taxes on electricity and halving charges for the use of the power grid. 

 The BDI, Germany's influential industrial lobby, has welcomed the plans and said they would provide much-needed relief for energy-hungry sectors such as steel and chemicals, as well as the small- and medium-sized businesses which form the backbone of the German economy. 

 All have suffered from the huge increase in costs for heat and electricity in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 

 Taxes on businesses would also be lowered and there is a promise to cut by 25 percent the cost of Germany's often fearsome bureaucracy. 

 The flagship proposals put forward by the two parties include a big increase in defence spending and a 500-billion-euro package to upgrade the country's creaking infrastructure. 

 The huge investments over several years could unleash a boom in both defence and construction sectors. 

 The latter could experience ""a bonanza"", according to analysts at Stifel investment bank, with production levels returning to where they were before the invasion of Ukraine within three years. 

 To help the battered automobile industry, the parties want to re-introduce subsidies for the purchases of electric vehicles after similar incentives were abolished two years ago. 

 In order to combat Germany's acute labour shortage, those who keep working past retirement age will not be taxed on the first 2,000 euros of earnings per month.

 The Green party has complained that the government-in-waiting has not included enough action on the climate emergency in its biggest spending plans. 

 Their dissatisfaction has potential consequences: the Greens' votes will be needed to get the two-thirds majority necessary to approve the plans in the outgoing parliament and so far they have said they will block them. 

 Claudia Kemfert, economist at the DIW institute, pointed to one harmful policy for the climate in the draft coalition programme: a rise in an tax rebate for those who commute by car. 

 The FAZ daily said that the big losers from the coalition's plans are ""future generations"" who will pay for the parties' refusal to raise the retirement age. 

 The newspaper estimated that ""over the next 15 years, the youngest will have to pay 500 billion euros more to finance pensions"". 

 The SPD has also had to swallow tougher conditions for accessing unemployment benefits, which it had made more generous under the outgoing government. 

 The Handelsblatt newspaper said that the reforms ""virtually mean the return of Hartz IV"", the controversial reform introduced in the 2000s which also restricted access to welfare benefits.

 The CDU/CSU and SPD want to put Germany back on track for potential growth of at least one percent annually, while the economy has been in a prolonged slump. 

 Currently, the government is predicting 0.3 percent growth for 2025 a meagre figure that would nonetheless be an improvement on the last two years in recession. 

 As of now, experts are not even sure Germany will be able to escape a third straight year of recession. 

 According to estimates from the DIW institute for economic analysis, the proposed 500 billion infrastructure stimulus will give a one-percent boost to GDP in 2026 and then more than two percent annually from 2027. 

 Bundesbank president Joachim Nagel has also warned that extra borrowing alone ""will not suffice to alleviate Germany's weak growth"".

Canada on Wednesday announced new 25% counter-tariffs on about C$30 billion ($20.8 billion) of US-made items after the Donald Trump administration implemented global levies on imports of steel and aluminium.

Canadian finance minister Dominic LeBlanc said the retaliatory measures will target US steel and aluminium products as well as consumer items such as computers and sporting goods. The new levies match the US tariffs “dollar for dollar” and will take effect at 12:01 a.m. New York time on Thursday, reported Bloomberg.

Melanie Joly, Canada's foreign minister, said the US tariffs are “unjustified and unjustifiable"". She said she would raise the matter with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the Group of Seven foreign ministers meeting, which Canada is hosting.

""We need to fight back against this nonsense,"" Joly added.

Earlier this month, the Canadian government imposed tariffs on C$30 billion of US products in response to Donald Trump's move to place 25% tariffs on many Canadian goods.

""We will not stand idly by while our iconic steel and aluminium industries are being unfairly targeted,"" he told reporters, according to AFP.

On Tuesday, Donald Trump, miffed with Ontario's surcharge on electricity exports, doubled the tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to the United States.

“I have instructed my Secretary of Commerce to add an ADDITIONAL 25% Tariff, to 50%, on all STEEL and ALUMINUM COMING INTO THE UNITED STATES FROM CANADA, ONE OF THE HIGHEST TARIFFING NATIONS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.

He also threatened to ruin Canada's car manufacturing industry.

""If other egregious, long-time Tariffs are not likewise dropped by Canada, I will substantially increase, on April 2nd, the Tariffs on Cars coming into the U.S. which will, essentially, permanently shut down the automobile manufacturing business in Canada,"" Trump warned.

 Hamas praised Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels Wednesday after they announced they would resume attacks on Israeli-linked shipping, calling it a demonstration of ""true commitment"" to the Palestinian cause. 

 ""It is a true commitment of support for our Palestinian people and their resistance, and it exerts real pressure to break the unjust siege on Gaza,"" Hamas said in a statement. 

 The Huthis, who hold the Yemeni capital Sanaa and swathes of the Red Sea coast, announced late Tuesday that they would resume attacks following the expiry of their deadline for Israel to stop blocking aid deliveries into Gaza. 

 The Huthis said they were resuming their ""ban on the passage of all Israeli ships"" in the Red Sea, the Bab al-Mandab strait, the Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea after Israel failed to meet a four-day deadline they had set for Gaza aid deliveries to resume. 

 Israel blocked all aid into the war-ravaged Gaza Strip earlier this month in an effort to pressure Hamas into agreeing an extension to the existing ceasefire in Gaza rather than moving onto a second stage. 

 Israel piled on more pressure on Sunday, announcing it would cut off the supply of electricity to a water desalination plant in Gaza. 

 However, Hamas said on Tuesday that a new round of ceasefire talks had begun in Qatar. 

 During the Gaza war, the Huthis launched dozens of drone and missile attacks on Israeli-linked shipping that drew retaliatory air strikes by the United States and Britain. 

 The Huthis halted their attacks when the Gaza ceasefire took effect in January but said on Tuesday that they would resume them until Israel allows aid deliveries back into Gaza. 

 Hamas welcomed the statement, saying it ""reflects the genuine stance of the Yemeni people"". 

 ""We call on the nations of the Arab and Muslim world, as well as all free people around the globe, to intensify their effective actions to pressure the Zionist occupation and its supporters until the aggression ends, the siege on Gaza is lifted and humanitarian aid reaches our besieged people,"" Hamas said.

A person of interest has been named in the disappearance of University of Pittsburgh student Sudishka Konanki, who went missing while on vacation in the Dominican Republic.

Fox News reported that Joshua Riibe, 24, of Iowa, is a person of interest in missing person's case, according to Loudoun County, Virginia Sheriff's Office spokesperson Thomas Julia. 

However, Julia said that this is still “a missing person case, not a criminal case,” and that Riibe has not been accused of any crimes. 

“Sheriff [Michael] Chapman wants to make sure the investigation is comprehensive and includes all possible assets and techniques,” Julia said to Fox News. “We are working closely with the FBI on all of this, and they are working with the Dominican National Police.”

Konanki, 20, a junior at the University of Pittsburgh, is a resident of Virginia's Loudoun County and also a citizen of India. She was traveling with five other female Pittsburgh students and last seen on March 6 walking on a beach at Riu Republica Resort in Punta Cana. 

Authorities are searching for Sudiksha Konanki, who went missing while on vacation in the Dominican Republic.Provided

Hotel surveillance footage taken at about 4:15 a.m. showed Konanki heading towards the beach with five other women and two men. The group had been drinking in the hotel's lobby around an hour earlier, CNN reported. 

Cameras captured the group, minus Konanki and one of the men at about 4:55 a.m. 

The man told authorities he and Konanki went into the ocean but he felt ill, got out of the water and fell asleep on a lounge chair.

Officials said the man was interviewed several times and gave differing details each time, CNN said, but there were no major inconsistencies and translation issues might have been the reason for any discrepancies.

It is not clear if Riibe and the man who was on the beach with Konanki are the same person.

U.S. federal authorities, including the FBI, are on the ground in the Dominican Republic assisting in the search.

“It's already four days and everybody's so worried,” family friend Shekar Pendem said to CNN. The Konanki family has lived in the U.S. since 2006 and are permanent residents in Virginia.

Anyone with information on Konanki's whereabouts is asked to call the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office at 703-777-1021.

 By Daria Sito-Sucic 

 SARAJEVO - Bosnian state prosecutors on Wednesday ordered the arrest of Serb separatist leader Milorad Dodik and his aides for ignoring a court summons, a move which Dodik pledged to resist with help from Russia in a widening standoff over the fragile country. 

 The dispute, which pits Dodik and his allies Russia and Serbia against the United States and the European Union, is one of the biggest threats to peace in the Balkans since the 1990s conflicts that followed socialist Yugoslavia's collapse. 

 It began after Dodik, the president of Bosnia's autonomous Serb Republic, defied rulings by the international envoy to Bosnia, whose role is to prevent the multi-ethnic Balkan state slipping back into conflict. 

 Dodik was sentenced to a year in jail and banned from holding office for six years in a court ruling that he can appeal. 

 In response, Dodik initiated laws barring state judiciary and police from the region. The state prosecutors' office then opened an investigation into what it described as an attack on constitutional order. 

 On Wednesday, it asked for Dodik's arrest for failing to respond to a court summons, although it was unclear whether it intended to detain him and his allies or just accompany them to court. 

 ""This is a null and void business,"" Dodik said at a press conference in the region's centre Banja Luka, showing the arrest warrant. ""This is politically motivated and we don't want to take part in it."" 

 Dodik is planning to hold high-level meetings with Russian representatives in the coming days, Russia's TASS state news agency reported on Wednesday. Dodik told the press conference he would ask Russia to veto the extension of the European peacekeeping mission for Bosnia in the United Nations Security Council, which is due in November. 

 The EU peacekeeping force, EUFOR, said on Tuesday that it had begun deploying reserve forces in Bosnia to maintain stability and security. It declined to give the number of troops but hundreds of new soldiers are expected to arrive. 

 The State Investigation and Protection Agency confirmed it has received a request to assist the state court police in apprehending Dodik, the region's Prime Minister Radovan Viskovic and parliament president Nenad Stevandic. 

 Both officials dismissed the state court and prosecution as ""unconstitutional institutions"" at the press conference. 

 Serb Republic Interior Minister Sinisa Karan said the region's police will act in accordance with Serb Republic legislation barring the state judiciary from its territory. 

 ""Nobody will be arrested and everyone will be protected,"" Karan told the ATV television. 

 RUSSIA VS THE WEST 

 Bosnia's Serb Republic and the Bosniak-Croat Federation are two regions created after Bosnia's 1992-95 war in which 100,000 died. They are linked by a weak central government in a state supervised by an international authority, known as the high representative, currently Christian Schmidt. 

 On Wednesday, the Serb region's parliament convened in a bid to adopt a new constitution for the Serb Republic, which would annul all reforms agreed in decades following the signing of the US-backed Dayton peace agreement that ended the war. 

 Schmidt warned that changing the constitution was a violation of the peace deal and represented ""a serious danger"". 

 He called on MPs to reject ""this attack on the constitutional order of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the multi-ethnic character of Republika Srpska"". 

 Dodik on Wednesday said he planned to label Schmidt's office a ""criminal organisation"" in the Serb Republic. 

 Russia, Serbia and Hungary have supported Dodik, who has said his region should split from Bosnia and join Serbia. Moscow has called the Bosnian court's ruling ""a strike on stability in the Balkan region"". 

 U.S. State Department Secretary Marco Rubio, however, said that Dodik's actions were undermining Bosnia's institutions and threatening its security and stability, calling on U.S. partners in the region ""to join us in pushing back against this dangerous and destabilizing behavior"". 

 His statement was a blow to Dodik who hopes that President Donald Trump's administration will favor the Serb separatist agenda.

 New Delhi, The European Union on Wednesday welcomed Ukraine's decision to agree to a 30-day ceasefire with Russia, an outcome that emerged following talks between American and Ukrainian negotiators in Saudi Arabia. 

 The 27-nation EU said it is ready to play its ""full part"" in supporting the upcoming steps, together with Ukraine, the U, and other partners. 

 It is not yet clear whether Russia will accept the proposal with the Kremlin saying it is waiting for a briefing by the US on the outcome of its talks with Ukraine in Jeddah on Tuesday. 

 The EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Kaja Kallas said the bloc ""welcomes the joint statement by Ukraine and the US following their meeting in Saudi Arabia, including the proposals for a ceasefire agreement"". 

 ""The European Union is ready to play its full part in supporting the upcoming steps, together with Ukraine, the United States, and other partners,"" she said. 

 Kallas said the EU's objective is to support Ukraine to reach a comprehensive, just and lasting peace based on the principles of the UN Charter and international law. 

 ""The proposal of a ceasefire - if accepted by Russia - can be an important step in this direction. It is now for Russia to show its willingness to achieve peace,"" she said. 

 Following their talks, Ukraine and the US in a joint statement said Kyiv expressed readiness to accept the US proposal to ""enact an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire, which can be extended by mutual agreement of the parties, and which is subject to acceptance and concurrent implementation by the Russian Federation"".` 

 It said the US will ""communicate to Russia that Russian reciprocity is the key to achieving peace"". 

 The US will immediately lift the pause on intelligence sharing and resume security assistance to Ukraine, it said.

Pak Train Hijack: The video captures the moment the rebels triggered a blast to hijack the train

A rebel group in Pakistan's south-western Balochistan bombed a section of the railway track and stormed a train on Tuesday afternoon in the mountainous southwest, shows a video released by the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), the group behind rising violence in the province which borders Afghanistan and Iran.

More than 450 passengers were on board when the rebels captured the train at the entrance of a tunnel in a remote frontier district, with an unknown number of hostages still being held. Pakistan security forces have launched a ""full-scale"" operation to rescue train passengers.

The 1 minute 23 seconds of the grainy footage shows passengers huddled on the ground silhouetted against the mountain, with rebels, holding guns, keeping a watch over them.

Over the course of two days, Pakistani forces have managed to free 190 hostages from the besieged train.

Passengers freed on Tuesday described walking for hours through mountainous terrain to reach safety.

""I can't find the words to describe how we managed to escape. It was terrifying,"" Muhammad Bilal, who had been travelling with his mother on the Jafar Express train, told news agency AFP.

The assault was immediately claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army. The rebels have demanded an exchange with security forces for its imprisoned members.



Security forces have been battling a decades-long insurgency in impoverished Balochistan. Still, violence has soared in the western border regions with Afghanistan, from north to south, since the Taliban took back power in 2021. 

The BLA claim the region's natural resources are being exploited by outsiders and have increased attacks targeting Pakistanis from other regions.

The rebels launched coordinated overnight attacks last year that included taking control of a major highway and shooting dead travellers from other ethnic groups, stunning the country.

Punjabi and Sindhi labourers are regularly targeted in attacks, as well as security forces and foreign infrastructure projects.

US Vice President JD Vance is set to visit India later this month alongside Second Lady Usha Vance, reported Politico citing three sources familiar with the plans. This will be Vance's second foreign visit since assuming office and his wife's first visit to her ancestral country as a second lady. He made his debut visit in France and Germany last month.

The Vice President's visit comes amid growing tensions between India and the US over tariff cuts.

US President Donald Trump earlier this month attacked India's tariffs, saying it is ""next to impossible to sell anything to India"" because of the ""high tariffs"". He also announced reciprocal tariffs that would take effect on April 2 in an aim to impose the same tariff rates on imports from foreign countries as those nations impose on US exports.

The 78-year-old Republican, whose tariff announcements have sent stock markets into a tailspin, later claimed that India has agreed to slash its tariffs on US imports. ""India charges us massive tariffs. Massive. You can't even sell anything in India... They have agreed, by the way, they want to cut their tariffs way down now because somebody is finally exposing them for what they have done,"" he told reporters at the White House.

However, India asserted that no such commitments have been made on trade tariff reductions to the US, adding that the negotiations between the two nations were still underway.

On Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, while lamenting the tariffs imposed by various nations on the US, referred to the tariffs imposed by India on US alcohol and agricultural products.

""In fact, I have a handy dandy chart here that shows not just Canada but the rate of tariffs across the board. If you look at Canada since you brought it up, American cheese and butter nearly 300 per cent tariff. You look at India, 150 per cent tariff on American alcohol. Do you think that's helping Kentucky bourbon be exported into India? I don't think so. 100 per cent tariff on agricultural products from India,"" she said.

Shortly after Vance assumed office, he met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the AI Summit in Paris last month. During the meeting, PM Modi gifted an eco-friendly wooden alphabet set to Vance's daughter, Mirabel Rose Vance. He even joined Vance and his family in celebrating their son Vivek's birthday.

Expressing his joy, PM Modi wrote on X, ""Had a wonderful meeting with US Vice President JD Vance and his family. We had a great conversation on various subjects. Delighted to join them in celebrating the joyous birthday of their son, Vivek!""

In response, Vance expressed his gratitude towards PM Modi, saying, ""Prime Minister Modi was gracious and kind, and our kids really enjoyed the gifts. I'm grateful to him for the wonderful conversation"".","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

 IOM reports surge in voluntary return requests from migrants in Mexico 

 * 

 Trump's immigration policies limit legal pathways for migrants at U.S. border

 Migrants face risks from crime groups in Mexico, fear staying without legal options 

 By Lizbeth Diaz 

 MEXICO CITY, - President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown has coincided with a surge in U.S.-bound migrants in Mexico seeking help to return to their home countries, according to the United Nations' International Organization for Migration . 

 In January and February, the agency received 2,862 requests for its assisted voluntary return program, more than triple the requests logged during the same period last year, according to IOM data shared exclusively with Reuters. 

 The record number of requests, which has not been previously reported, reveals the fallout of Trump's wide-ranging immigration crackdown, which has left thousands, if not tens of thousands, of migrants stranded in Mexico. 

 It's also the first hard evidence of a shift in attitudes among migrants who once viewed the opportunities offered in the U.S. as worth the hazards involved in the journey northward. The shift jibes with other recent numbers showing migrant arrests at the U.S. southern border dropping dramatically. 

 Over the last two months, the agency has received requests from migrants seeking to return to Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Venezuela and other countries, Alberto Cabezas, spokesman for IOM in Mexico, said. He did not elaborate on the reasons behind the increase. 

 Israel Ibarra, a researcher with the Mexican think tank COLEF, said the increase reflects the sharply limited legal pathways now faced by migrants waiting in Mexico. 

 “There's no options for them,” he said. 

 Starting on January 20, Trump has taken a series of measures aimed at cracking down on migration, including implementing a broad ban on asylum for migrants encountered at the southern border and ending some legal pathways for migrants to enter the U.S. 

 The abrupt termination of one such humanitarian parole program, known as CBP One, left thousands of migrants from around the world suddenly stranded in Mexico with few, if any, legal pathways to reach the U.S. 

 About 20 migrants in Mexico told Reuters that since CBP One ended on January 20 they've sought to return to their home countries, but lack the money or documents to do so. Some don't have valid passports, required for boarding international flights. 

 Many migrants fear staying in Mexico due to the risks of assault, kidnapping, and extortion by powerful organized crime groups that prey on migrants. 

 IOM is only able to help repatriate a fraction of the people who request help getting home. In February, the agency helped some 330 migrants across the region return to their home countries, according to IOM data shared with Reuters. 

 The National Migration Institute did not respond to requests for comment. 

 Josybeth, a 37-year-old Venezuelan woman stranded in northern Mexico, said that now that the legal pathways to enter the U.S. are closed, she'd rather return to Venezuela than stay in Mexico. But she said her and her children's passports were expired and they didn't have enough money to pay for the long journey. 

 ""I never wanted to live here in Mexico,"" she said. ""I want to go back.""

A powerful new AI tool Manus is making waves in China, fuelling hopes that it could replicate the success of DeepSeek, which earlier this year rattled the global tech industry with its state-of-the-art chatbot.

Manus, an AI agent generally considered more advanced than a chatbot, can do everything from analysing the stock market to creating a personalised travel handbook for a trip with simple instructions from users, its website says.

Here's what you need to know about Manus:

Manus was released last week by Chinese startup Butterfly Effect.

In a now viral introductory video posted online, co-founder Yichao ""Peak"" Ji hailed it as ""the next paradigm of human-machine collaboration, and potentially a glimpse into AGI,"" referencing artificial general intelligence that aims to think the way humans do.

Currently accessible only by invitation, Manus has quickly gained traction, with its official Discord server growing to more than 170,000 members.

Its name comes from the Latin motto ""Mens et Manus"", meaning ""mind and hand"" -- a nod to its integration of knowledge and practical application.

Manus is a ""system that can carry out tasks autonomously on behalf of users"", said Manoj Harjani, a research fellow at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS).

""DeepSeek and ChatGPT differ from Manus in that they provide responses to prompts from users through a chat-style interface, whereas Manus is able to execute tasks such as booking tickets and sorting through resumes,"" he explained.

And while DeepSeek was quietly developed behind the scenes before rising to prominence, Manus is taking a different route -- limiting access to an invite-only beta and targeting enterprise-level clients, one analyst said.

""While this exclusivity can generate buzz, it may also impede widespread adoption,"" said Marina Zhang, an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney's Australia-China Relations Institute.

She warned Manus may not cultivate the same broad appeal as DeepSeek, which built a large community through open-source engagement, if it continues to retain a closed ecosystem.

When AFP tested Manus with an invitation code given by the company, the AI assistant took significantly longer than DeepSeek to generate responses.

But it was able to complete more difficult tasks compared to its Chinese rival or ChatGPT, like creating custom websites.

And while DeepSeek said it was ""programmed"" to provide answers that toe the government line on topics considered politically sensitive in China, Manus was able to give accurate, non-censored responses.

On the topic of the bloody 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in and around Tiananmen Square in Beijing, Manus responded by stating that ""the Chinese government carried out a violent crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square in Beijing"", followed by six more paragraphs detailing the incident.

It also gave a comprehensive answer when asked about allegations of human rights abuses by Beijing in Xinjiang.

Asked about its uncensored replies, the programme said it does not ""intentionally censor factual information"".

""When discussing sensitive topics like historical events or human rights issues, I aim to provide balanced, objective information that helps users understand complex subjects,"" it added.

This could likely be because Manus ""is focused on tasks and the team didn't build content control as thoroughly as chatbots like DeepSeek and ChatGPT"", said Li Jianggan, founder of Momentum Works, a Singapore-based consultancy focused on tech companies.

Whether Manus can achieve mainstream success like DeepSeek will depend on its ability to scale to meet demand, RSIS's Harjani told AFP.

But Manus is unlikely to be the next DeepSeek as they are different types of AI applications, he added.

Its ability to grow would rely on ""adequate computing power and effective handling of potential challenges such as technical stability and ethical or regulatory considerations"", Zhang told AFP.

""If Manus can successfully address these issues... it could indeed be a major player in the enterprise automation space,"" she said.

But it remains ""far from perfect"" and is likely not open to the wider public yet as the team may still want to make improvements to the programme, Li said.

""It is dealing with real world problems and executing real world tasks, which are diverse and complex,"" he told AFP.

Its success remains a ""big question mark"".

US President Donald Trump vowed to respond to the European Union's (EU) retaliatory tariffs on select American goods as he defended his decision to impose 25% tariffs on imported steel and aluminium from all trading partners.

""We've been abused for a long time, and we will be abused no longer,"" Trump said during a meeting with Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin.

The US president said that he will be willing to grant “very little flexibility” to trading partners once his tariffs are implemented. Pointing out again to the “massive” trade deficit, Trump said his tariff policies will “even that out.”

Trump also said his decision to provoke a tariff war with America's biggest trade partners will restore “fairness” even as major allies like the UK indicated that all options are on the table while responding to US tariffs.

The European Union will levy partial tariffs worth $28 billion on certain US products including steel and aluminium products, textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods. These retaliatory measures will be enforced starting April 1 and will be fully in place by April 13.

Canada, the largest foreign supplier of steel and aluminium to the US, responded with its countermeasures. Its additional retaliatory tariffs worth $20.7 billion will target steel and aluminium products, computers, sports equipment and water heaters.

Trump defended his trade policy during a Business Roundtable on Tuesday saying they will make the companies invest in US factories. 

Speaking to the CEOs, Trump said, “The higher it goes, the more likely it is they're going to build. The biggest win is if they move into our country and produce jobs. That's a bigger win than the tariffs themselves, but the tariffs are going to be throwing off a lot of money to this country.”

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP face carnage in response to Trump's policies and announcements. The total market capitalization of crypto is down to $2.784 trillion on Wednesday. 

Bitcoin's correlation (BTC) with the S&P 500 is 0.75 in the 30-day timeframe, signaling to traders that the top crypto is behaving like U.S. equities. Trumpism, or what U.S. President Donald Trump believes in a particular moment on a particular day about a subject that has ushered a steep correction in crypto within the first fifty days of his administration. 

Table of Contents

U.S. stocks are facing a slump, the S&P 500 is down nearly 8% in the past month, and is lower than it was the day before President Trump won the 2024 election. $4.5 trillion in capital has been wiped out of the market, per the index, and the correction is not limited to equities. 

Crypto, typically considered one of the high volatility risk assets, has faced a steep decline as traders turn risk averse and pull capital from the category. 

While U.S. stock performance is among one of the worst ever recorded within the first 50 days of a new administration, crypto market capitalization is nearly 20% above the pre-election level, even after the correction. 

When Bitcoin crossed the $100,000 milestone and hit a new all-time high, Ethereum and XRP rallied alongside. The market-wide bloodbath has ushered a decline in the top three cryptos, down nearly 15%, 28% and 9% in the past month, according to TradingView data. 

Trump's pro-crypto executive orders and Strategic Crypto Reserve announcement have failed to catalyze a positive sentiment among traders. Alternative.me's Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows traders remain fearful on Wednesday. 

In a February report, Forbes evaluated the impact of Donald Trump's return to the Presidency on alternative investments like digital assets. The publication outlined that it depends on “the details of policy implementation, market expectations, and global economic conditions. While some sectors may benefit from deregulation or tax incentives, others might face reduced government support or policy shifts.”

Traders, therefore, need to proactively switch strategies and adjust portfolios, trade headline to headline, and anticipate the potential changes, such as the inclusion of different tokens in the U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve, to prioritize categories of tokens that are likely to receive favorable treatment or have inherent resilience to policy-induced volatility.

The crypto market and top three tokens continued their decline this week after nearly four-consecutive weeks of correction. As crypto traders digest Trump's tariff wars and executive orders, institutions and market participants have turned risk-averse and realized losses in Bitcoin are mounting. 

BTC is now at a crossroads where financial easing could mean crypto tokens gain, as traders drive demand for risk assets higher. However geopolitical headwinds and Trumpism continue to weigh heavily on the sector. 

The debate on whether a Strategic Crypto Reserve would meet the expectations of the crypto community and what the inclusion of Ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) means for holders of the token wages on social media platforms. 

Traders now wait and watch for the narrative to unfold. It is typical for the Bitcoin price to drop between 20 and 25% before it rallies during a bull market. However, the macroeconomic headwinds and higher number of market movers make it challenging to predict BTC price trends in the coming weeks and months. 

The $80,000 level remains a crucial support for Bitcoin; a return to the $100,000 milestone could see BTC rally towards its all-time high and test it. However, a decline from $80,000 could push the token to pre-election levels under $70,000. 

Another 15% drop from the current price level could erase all post-election gains for Bitcoin. 

Ethereum price is 30% below its pre-election level, back to the price recorded in November of 2023. A multitude of factors, lack of institutional interest, concerns regarding changes within the Ethereum Foundation, liquidation of whales who borrowed stablecoins against their Ether holdings as collateral, and waning interest from large wallet traders have negatively impacted Ethereum price trend. 

Ether trades at $1,846 at the time of writing, and traders await a catalyst, like SEC approval, to add staking to existing Ether ETFs in the U.S. to drive gains in the largest altcoin in crypto. 

XRP is the most resilient among the top three cryptocurrencies, trading 75% above its pre-election levels. At the time of writing, XRP trades at $2.1668. 

Catalysts like the token's addition to the U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve, Ripple executive's inclusion in Trump's elite Crypto Summit last Friday, and SEC's changing stance on litigation against crypto firms have contributed to the gain in XRP price. 

Bitcoin and XRP traders have consistently taken profits on their holdings since mid-February. However, in the case of Ethereum, the behavior of traders is akin to capitulation. Traders have realized losses on their Ether holdings, as seen by the negative spikes in the Network realized profit/loss metric on Santiment. 

Capitulation is followed by stability in prices, however it remains to be seen whether Ether price will recover in the coming weeks and months. 

The total open interest in USD in the three tokens has shown a steady decline since the last week of February. This implies that derivatives traders are losing interest in the top 3 cryptos, in line with the risk-off sentiment and the U.S. stock market bloodbath. 

As Bitcoin behaves more like a U.S. tech stock every day, the “Bitcoin as a hedge and safe haven” narrative takes a hit, and cryptos are identified as one of the risk-assets among alternative investments. 

A crypto analyst behind the X handle @davthewave believes that the worst of the crypto market correction is behind us. Bitcoin bull run is far from over, and the analyst checks the box on five key pointers that support their thesis. 

The average correction in Bitcoin price in the last three bull runs was between 24 and 32% in the years 2016-17, 2020-21 and 2023-24 respectively. The recent correction in BTC is therefore well within the average and does not directly signal the end of the bull market. 

The crypto Bitcoin bull run index is a metric used to analyze nine different statistics to determine the stage of the market cycle. Indicators like PI Cycle, MVRV Z-Score and Reserve Risk are used to identify whether it is a Bitcoin bull or bear market. 

In the last three cycles, every time CBBI crosses 90, Bitcoin hit a new all-time high. This hasn't happened yet in the ongoing cycle, meaning there is a likelihood that the bull market is ongoing and BTC is likely to peak in the coming months of 2025. 

Agne Linge, Head of Growth at WeFi shared written commentary with Crypto.news, commenting on rising market volatility in Bitcoin, in response to shifting macro conditions. 

Linge said, 

“Bitcoin has fluctuated between $79K and $85K over the past two weeks, reflecting heightened market volatility driven by mounting geopolitical and macroeconomic pressures. The market sentiment is tense, and trade tensions have escalated again, with new tariffs expected to be implemented on April 2nd. Today, new 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports have taken effect, prompting a swift retaliation from the European Union, which plans to impose counter measures on goods worth 26 billion euros (about £22 billion pounds) starting next month.

Heightened macro volatility and geopolitical tensions have driven investors toward safe-haven assets like the U.S. Treasuries, reflecting a broader shift toward capital preservation amid growing market uncertainty. Meanwhile, Germany's decision to raise debt to finance a military buildup has triggered a sharp selloff in German government bonds (bunds), reinforcing the flight to U.S. Treasuries as investors seek greater stability.”

Bitfinex analysts told Crypto.news, 

“Such widespread capitulation often precedes market stabilisation, though geopolitical and macroeconomic concerns remain a significant overhang.”

Dr. Sean Dawson, Head of Research at Derive.xyz told Crypto.news:

“The market is facing significant challenges as the macroeconomic environment worsens, and crypto assets are no exception. 

With bearish sentiment building, traders are turning to downside hedging strategies, especially as volatility surges across both traditional and crypto markets. The coming weeks will be critical for assessing how the broader economic situation impacts digital asset prices and trading behaviour.”

The Securities and Exchange Commission is scaling back its cryptocurrency enforcement unit. Why does this matter? Because crime pervades the crypto industry.

Just last month, a hacker stole about $1.5 billion from the crypto exchange Bybit in the biggest theft the industry has ever experienced. As this incident suggests, crypto crime seems to be getting worse, not better.

Indeed, crypto crime likely broke records last year. Illicit crypto addresses received an estimated total of $40 billion to as much as $75 billion in 2024.

Ask a generative AI program for ‘historical' footage and what you get could spell the end of documents and documentaries we can believe in.

Cryptocurrency is being used to perpetrate crimes that affect all Americans. One of the best examples is ransomware, malicious software that prevents users from accessing their computer files, systems or networks unless they pay a ransom. Crypto is the dominant form of payment demanded in these attacks because it enables cybercriminals to receive money anonymously and quickly transfer their illicit gains overseas.

Ransomware attacks reached an all-time high in 2024, targeting sectors that Americans rely on every day. In February 2024, for example, the insurer UnitedHealth Group experienced an attack that affected hospitals, doctors' offices, pharmacies and millions of patients across the nation. UnitedHealth paid a ransom of about $22 million in bitcoin.

Tech CEOs may be doing a political 180, but the majority of engineers, investors and scientists who make Silicon Valley the global center of innovation and profit vote Democratic. 

Like ransomware attacks, meme coin “rug pulls” can have many victims. A meme coin is a cryptocurrency that is inspired by a celebrity, meme or internet trend. They're highly volatile, speculative assets that are susceptible to fraud. In a rug pull, insiders buy up a large share of meme coin tokens in advance and then dump them after the price soars, leaving regular investors with tokens that are essentially worthless.

One recent example is the case of Haliey Welch, who gained internet fame as the “Hawk Tuah Girl” when she was featured in a TikTok video that went viral. In December, after parlaying her newfound celebrity into a merchandise line and podcast, she launched a meme coin. The coin's price initially surged, but its value quickly plummeted by more than 90% after a small group of owners sold off more than 80% of the token's supply. One investor wrote on social media, “I am a huge fan of Hawk Tuah but you took my life savings.”

While rug pulls dupe multiple investors at a time, many crypto crimes target individual victims. One particularly devastating crypto fraud is known as “pig butchering” or “romance baiting.” These scams involve online criminals luring their victims into fake romances and then stealing their money by inducing them to invest in cryptocurrency.

Many people lose their life savings to these scams. One California victim, Shai Plonski, said he thought he had found the “perfect woman” on Facebook. Plonski and “Sandy” traded messages about their supposedly shared interests in yoga and poetry until Plonski revealed that his business was struggling, at which point Sandy suggested he invest in crypto with her guidance. Plonski eventually put his life savings into what he thought was a cryptocurrency investment and, when he became concerned, found he couldn't withdraw his funds. He was one of more than 40,000 victims of these scams in the United States.

Another scam on the rise involves bitcoin ATMs. A scammer persuades a victim to deposit cash into a bitcoin ATM by using a QR code. The ATM then converts the cash to bitcoin that is immediately transferred to the scammer's digital wallet.

Seniors are particularly susceptible to bitcoin ATM scams. Beaufort County, S.C., which has a large senior population, reported $3.1 million in losses to crypto scams last year, including several involving bitcoin ATMs. One retired healthcare worker got a call purportedly from the sheriff's office, informing her that she had missed her jury duty and must post a $7,500 bond to remain free until her court date. She deposited the cash into a bitcoin ATM and lost the money.

These are just a few of the ways in which criminals use crypto to harm ordinary Americans. Unfortunately, there are many others, some of which are used to finance terrorism. This is why we should be strengthening our efforts to prevent crypto crime, not weakening them.

The SEC's new leaders say they don't want crypto to “be a haven for fraudsters.” Unfortunately, it already is. It's up to them and other regulators to protect the American people from the crime that pervades this industry.

Gov. Pillen Signs Bill Creating Protections from Cryptocurrency Fraud

LINCOLN, NE — Governor Jim Pillen has signed LB609 into law. This bipartisan, law-enforcement-supported legislation establishes the Controllable Electronic Record Fraud Prevention Act to help combat fraud and protect users of cryptocurrency kiosks/ATMs.

“Cryptocurrency is an important, emerging industry — and we've been working hard to build Nebraska into a cryptocurrency leader,” said Gov. Pillen. “An important part of these efforts is to make sure that we have guardrails to prevent criminals from taking advantage of Nebraskans. We look forward to continuing to lay the groundwork for a safe and robust crypto industry in our state. This is good news for consumers.""

“Nebraska is open for business in the cryptocurrency space,” said Nebraska Department of Banking Director Kelly Lammers. ""That also means we need to increase transparency to assure those doing legal business in the State of Nebraska that you are absolutely welcome. Of course, those that target our citizens, that look to exploit Nebraskans and their financial resources, using Crypto ATMs as part of their transfer method, we will soon have a team that will be watching even more closely.""

Key Points

It's hard to imagine a larger catalyst for cryptocurrencies than the one on March 6, when the White House issued an executive order that the U.S. would be forming both a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a national Digital Asset Stockpile.

 And yet in the wake of that ultra-bullish announcement, the prices of major cryptos including Bitcoin (BTC -0.66%), Ethereum (ETH -3.84%), Solana (SOL -2.27%), XRP (XRP 2.13%), and Cardano (ADA -0.94%) are all down, and substantially in most cases.

So what's going on here? Let's dig into the details of the new reserve announcement and add some context.

Under the plan for the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the Digital Asset Stockpile, the government will not be buying any of the cryptocurrencies mentioned above, at least not in a way that involves spending from the nation's budget.

Aside from the executive order mandating the creation of the stockpile and the reserve, there are many steps remaining before these repositories will actually exist. Those steps may or may not be taken, depending on various political, financial, and bureaucratic contingencies.

As far as Bitcoin goes, the order -- as well as the administration's stated vision for the reserve -- makes it clear that the government should now retain any of the cryptocurrency that comes into its possession via asset seizure or forfeitures, rather than sell it. Some investors had been hoping for overt purchasing activity on a regular basis, funded with discretionary and budgetary capital, much like the other strategic resource reserves maintained by the country. Therefore, there is a bit of a disconnect between expectations and outcomes, which explains the coin's decline.

For Ethereum, Cardano, Solana, and XRP, as well as other assets intended for the stockpile, the picture is slightly different, but the gist is the same.

Based on the president's initial remarks on social media in advance of issuing the executive order, those cryptos would be included in the newly formed stockpile. Yet according to the executive order, as well as the White House crypto summit on March 7, it's very unlikely that the government will devote a meaningful amount of money to actually stockpiling them beyond retaining what it obtains via asset forfeitures. It will be subject to the same budget-neutral conditions as with Bitcoin. That's hardly what investors wanted.

Either way, the negative price impact on these altcoins is sharper than with Bitcoin because they had more to gain from potentially being purchased by the government since they're smaller assets. Without a mandate for federal crypto purchases to fill the repository, investors were left to reprice their assumptions about the value of those cryptos.

If you're terrified by the crypto price action during the past few weeks, you aren't alone. It could be reasonable to rebalance your holdings if you think that there are hard times ahead.

But if you can convince yourself to buy the dip rather than sell your coins in fear, there probably are profits waiting for you down the line. Here's why:

The government picks up cryptocurrency from criminal and civil asset forfeitures and seizures all the time. If it decides to hold those coins and stockpile them indefinitely instead of selling them, that's less circulating supply. Every little bit helps support higher prices over the long term.

There's nothing bearish in the stockpile announcement; there's just the market's reaction to good news that wasn't as bullish as what was (unjustifiably) anticipated.

The longer your time horizon, the more supply the government will hold rather than sell. For Bitcoin in particular, this will mesh favorably with its supply dynamics, which ensure that it's perpetually in scarcer supply because of the steadily increasing difficulty of mining new coins. But other coins also will benefit, as long as there are disreputable actors who use crypto to break laws and have their assets seized. 

And that's almost guaranteed to happen. So, take advantage of these lower prices and load up on the coins you think will be around in 10 years, and let the government do some of the work of increasing their value for you.

Bitcoin (BTC) price hovers around $82,500 on Wednesday after recovering 5.52% the previous day. A K33 report highlights heavy sell-offs in equities and crypto markets amid rising concerns over a fragile global economy. Traders should remain cautious as the upcoming US macro data releases could bring more volatility in risky assets like Bitcoin.





Bitcoin (BTC), XRP and Solana (SOL) prices struggle on Wednesday. The three tokens rank in the top 5 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, and the risk-off sentiment in the crypto market has ushered in a cooling-off period. 

Bitcoin attempted to close above the $100,000 milestone thrice in the first week of February. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization opened above that level each day and failed to close, slipping lower. 



The cryptocurrency market bounced 2% in the last 24 hours to $2.67 trillion. So far, the situation looks like a small rebound after the collapse. We should not talk about the beginning of recovery as long as the market is below its 200-day moving average of $2.83 trillion.

According to Justin Sun, the cryptocurrency market is experiencing a phase of 'small steps, fast running' growth, indicating a strategy of incremental but rapid advancements. This approach suggests a focus on steady, manageable increases in value or technology improvements, rather than large, volatile jumps. Sun's commentary, shared via Twitter, highlights the importance of consistent progress in the volatile crypto space.

EMB: March 12, 16:00 UTC

Modular blockchain Hemi Labs' unveiled its mainnet with $440 million in total value locked (TVL).

Hemi, founded by early Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik, plans to unify Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two oldest and largest blockchains, into ""a single supernetwork,"" according to an emailed announcement. 

Hemi is built on both Bitcoin and Ethereum to combine the best qualities of both, taking advantage of Bitcoin's security and Ethereum's programmability. The project raised $15 million in a funding round led by Binance Labs last September.

The project is one of several looking to transform the broader blockchain landscape, particularly with regard to decentralized finance (DeFi), through combining Bitcoin and Ethereum due in part to the deep stores of value held in bitcoin (BTC), which comfortably exceed those of every other digital asset combined.

However, Bitcoin's coding lacks the ability to natively build some of the functions that DeFi requires, such as smart contracts or zero-knowledge proofs, hence the need to bridge this utility from Ethereum.

The company has signed up dozens of protocols for deployment on Hemi, including decentralized exchange (DEX) Sushi, liquid staking token pumpBTC and oracles RedStone and Pyth.

Bitcoin (BTC) price hovers around $82,500 on Wednesday after recovering 5.52% the previous day. A K33 report highlights heavy sell-offs in equities and crypto markets amid rising concerns over a fragile global economy. Traders should remain cautious as the upcoming US macro data releases could bring more volatility in risky assets like Bitcoin.

Tuesday's K33 Research ‘Ahead of the Curve' report explains that equities and crypto markets have been hit with heavy sell-offs as concerns about a fragile global economy have heightened. 

Increased recession fears, US President Donald Trump's commitment to lowering 10-year bond yields, and the first swings of a bubbling trade war have pushed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to lows not seen since mid-September. Similarly, BTC reached new yearly lows of $76,555 and saw a weekly return of -5%. 

The report continues that while many Trump measures have contributed to spooking the market into heavy de-risking, the President has delivered his crypto promises by establishing a crypto working group and launching a US BTC reserve last week. This justifies BTC's relative outperformance compared to equity indices since the election.

The graph below shows the major asset returns since the election (left) and the inauguration day (right). Since the election, BTC's performance has been 13%, outperforming other asset classes. However, its performance since the inauguration (January 13 market close) has been negative 25%, the second worst-performing asset (Ethereum is -46%).

“We fundamentally disagree with pundits attributing the recent sell-off to an underwhelming US reserve,” reports a K33 analyst. 

The analyst continues, “This reserve is a watershed moment for Bitcoin. The US government has committed to hold seized assets and even explore paths to acquire more BTC in the market. This is a huge leap forward in legitimizing BTC as a global store of value and is a massive disconnect from its recent performance driven by other market forces. While global market uncertainties may need time to be resolved, we perceive current price levels and the period ahead as a solid opportunity to buy and hold BTC long-term.”

In an exclusive interview with FXStreet, Ian Balina, CEO of Token Metrics, explained that Bitcoin's decline, despite favorable regulations and rising BTC reserves, is largely driven by macroeconomic concerns, particularly tariff disputes between the United States, Canada, India, and other countries. He noted that this has prompted a shift towards liquidity, with ‘investors taking profits and adopting a more cautious stance.'

Balina also predicted continued volatility, highlighting the $70,000 support level but warning that the prevailing bearish and risk-off sentiment leaves room for further downside.

Traders and investors are closely watching the US macroeconomic data releases – the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Wednesday and the Producer Price Index (PPI) on Thursday – which could bring more volatility for risky assets like Bitcoin and shape the direction of equities and digital assets ahead of the Federal Reserve (Fed) interest rate decision on March 19.

In an exclusive interview, Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, told FXStreet, “The FOMC meeting this week will likely result in the Federal Reserve keeping rates at 4.25%-4.50%, with a neutral-to-cautious tone.”

Lee continued though a hawkish shift could emerge if inflation concerns resurface. Crypto prices like Bitcoin might stagnate or drop from their current $83,000-$76,000 range, especially if a hawkish outcome strengthens the US Dollar (USD) and yields, pressuring risk assets. 

“Even a dovish surprise like a rate cut may fail to ignite a sustained rally, given potential market skepticism and overriding macro uncertainties. At the same time, the end of quantitative tightening offers only modest support at best,” Lee explained.

Bitcoin price broke below its 200-day EMA at $85,664 on Sunday and declined 9.14% until the next day. However, BTC pushed lower, found support around the $76,600 level, and recovered 5.52% on Tuesday. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it hovers at around $82,500.

If BTC continues to correct and closes below $78,258 (February 28 low), it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $73,072.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart reads 39, pointing upwards after bouncing off from 30 on Monday, indicating fading bearish momentum and a potential shift from oversold conditions. However, the RSI must move above its neutral level of 50 for the recovery rally to be sustained.

If bullish momentum mounts, BTC could extend the recovery to $85,000.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility.

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

Ethereum price is in its third consecutive week in the red as investors remain on the sidelines.

Ethereum (ETH) traded at $1,758 this week, its lowest level since October 2023. It has plunged by over 55% from its highest level in November last year. 

Ether has crashed for several reasons. Spot Ethereum ETFs have continued to experience outflows, a sign of waning demand from Wall Street investors. Total outflows in the last three weeks stood at over $513 million, bringing the cumulative net inflows to $2.64 billion.

Ethereum continues to lose market share in key industries like stablecoin processing and decentralized exchanges. Tron (TRX) has become the biggest blockchain for Tether processing, while layer-2 networks like Base and Arbitrum are gaining market share. 

Further, Ethereum is no longer the most profitable player in the crypto industry. It has made $210 million this year, much lower than what networks like Uniswap, Solana, Circle, Jito, Tron, and Tether have made. For a long time, Ethereum was the most profitable company in crypto. 

Santiment data shows that the number of daily active Ethereum addresses has continued falling. ETH had 293,000 addresses on March 12, down from over 717,000 earlier this year. As shown below, the social volume has continued moving downwards in the past few months.

The weekly chart shows that Ethereum's price has been on a freefall after finding a strong barrier at $4,000, where it formed a triple-top pattern. Ether has now crashed below the key support at $2,135, the neckline of this triple-top pattern.

It has also dropped below the 50-week moving average and the lower side of the ascending channel. This lower side connects the lowest swings in July and November 2022, October 2023, and September 2024. This decline is a sign that bears have prevailed.

Ethereum is no longer oversold, meaning that it has more downside ahead. The Relative Strength Index has moved to 33, pointing to further downside. The Awesome Oscillator has moved below the zero line.

Therefore, the path of the least resistance for the coin is bearish, with the initial target to watch being at $1,500. A drop below that level risks falling to the next psychological point at $1,000, down by 45% below the current level. A move above the major S/R level at $2,500 will invalidate the bearish view.

Video-sharing platform Rumble boosts its Bitcoin holdings with a 188 BTC purchase, reinforcing its commitment to a Bitcoin treasury strategy.

Rumble (NASDAQ: RUM), the video-sharing platform and cloud services provider, has announced the purchase of approximately 188 Bitcoin, valued at around $17.1 million, as part of its previously disclosed Bitcoin treasury strategy. Acquired at an average price of approximately $91,000 per coin, this purchase is a part of the company's plan to allocate up to $20 million into Bitcoin.

“We are excited to announce these purchases and allocation of Bitcoin as part of our treasury strategy as well as a larger strategic move as we further expand our ties to the crypto industry,” said Rumble Chairman and CEO Chris Pavlovski. “These holdings have the potential to serve as a valuable hedge against inflation and will not be subject to dilution like so many overprinted government-issued currencies. As a leading video and cloud services platform for the crypto community, we are proud to officially hold Bitcoin as we continue to grow and engrain crypto into our company's DNA.”

The announcement follows Rumble's previously disclosed corporate treasury diversification strategy, which was approved by its Board of Directors. The strategy aims to leverage Bitcoin as a strategic asset to accelerate the company's expansion into digital assets while strengthening its financial position.

“We believe that the world is still in the early stages of the adoption of Bitcoin, which has recently accelerated with the election of a crypto-friendly U.S. presidential administration and increased institutional adoption,” Pavlovski stated. “Unlike any government-issued currency, Bitcoin is not subject to dilution through endless money-printing, enabling it to be a valuable inflation hedge and an excellent addition to our treasury. We are also excited to strengthen our ties with crypto and to bolster our efforts to become the leading video and cloud services platform for the crypto community.”

The company noted that the actual timing and value of any future Bitcoin acquisitions will depend on various factors, including general market conditions, Bitcoin's trading price, and Rumble's anticipated cash needs. Rumble stated their strategy will remain flexible and may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time based on the company's discretion.

Bitcoin (BTC) clawed its way back to nearly $82,000, staging a relief rally after dipping below $78,000 late Sunday, leading to a slight run-up in major tokens.

Ether (ETH), BNB Chain's BNB, XRP and Cardano's ADA rose as much as 3%, alleviating some losses from the past 7 days. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) added nearly 4%.

Elsewhere, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delaying decisions on XRP, Dogecoin, and Litecoin filings. Bloomberg analysts had previously pegged Litecoin's odds at 90%, Doge at 75%, and XRP at 65% for an ETF approval by year-end, yet the regulator's hesitation is keeping the market on edge.

Traders still eye a pullback to the $74,000 level, and below, before an eventual push higher.

“Previously, a similar decline would complete a corrective pullback, attracting buyers,” Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro chief market analyst, told CoinDesk in an email.

“However, the chances of such an outcome are now lower than in previous years due to the powerful influence of traditional financial companies, which has strengthened the link between the crypto market and stock dynamics.The scenario of a pullback to the $70-$74K area still looks the most probable for us. This is all the truer as the consolidation and rebound in early March has taken the short-term oversold stance out of the market,” Kuptsikevich added.

Gains in BTC came as Senator Cynthia Lummis reintroduced the BITCOIN Act, pushing for the U.S. to scoop up 1 million BTC as a strategic reserve. The bill, which Lummis first introduced last year, would direct the government to purchase 1 million bitcoins over five years.

The first $6 billion in remittances from reserve banks would be set aside each year between 2025 and 2029 to build up the reserve and rely on the Fed's gold certificates.

Some speculated the possible inclusion of major tokens in such a reserve in the future.

“Altcoins such as XRP, SOL, and ADA pumped higher than expected as pro-crypto Senator Lummis reintroduced her strategic Bitcoin reserve bill to purchase 1 million Bitcoins, and there's speculation that previously announced altcoins will later be included in the reserve purchases,” Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.

The liquidation of an over $200 million long trade on ether (ETH) lead to a $4 million loss for Hyperliquid, where the ""whale"" placed the bet.

The liquidation saw wallet ""0xf3f4"" opening a highly leveraged 50x long ETH position, depositing $4.3 million USDC as margin for a total size of 113,000 ETH.

The wallet then started withdrawing funds, reducing the margin below maintenance requirements in a move that resulted in a $1.8 million profit for the user but a $4 million loss for Hyperliquid's Hyperliquid Provider (HLP) vault.

Vaults are a blockchain-based product on Hyperliquid where users can deposit USDC to potentially earn a share of profits generated by trading strategies of other users or the vault's owner.

The moves created speculation among Hyperliquid users of a possible exploit of the platform, a rumor it doused in an X post.

“There was no protocol exploit or hack,” Hyperliquid said. “This user had unrealized PNL, withdrew, which lowered their margin, and was liquidated. They ended with ~$1.8M in PNL. HLP lost ~$4M over the past 24h. HLP's all-time PNL remains at ~$60M. As a reminder, HLP is not a risk-free strategy.”

Hyperliquid added that it will update the maximum leverage for bitcoin (BTC) and ETH to 40x and 25x, respectively, to increase maintenance margin requirements for larger positions as a preventive measure for similar moves in the future.

Hyperliquid's HLP vault still has an all-time profit of $60 million, data shows. Meanwhile, the platform's HYPE token dropped from $14 to under $13 in a knee-jerk move after the liquidation, though it has since fully recovered the brief slide as of late Asian hours.

Video platform Rumble has acquired approximately 188 Bitcoin for $17.1 million, averaging $91,000 per coin.

This purchase comes as part of its Bitcoin (BTC) treasury strategy. The company announced a plan to allocate up to $20 million to Bitcoin, emphasizing its desire to branch out into the cryptocurrency sector.

CEO Chris Pavlovski spoke on Bitcoin's role as a hedge against inflation and its alignment with Rumble's broader crypto-focused strategy.

 “These holdings have the potential to serve as a valuable hedge against inflation and will not be subject to dilution like so many overprinted government-issued currencies,” Pavlovski said.

Rumble, known for its video-sharing and cloud services, has positioned itself as a platform catering to the crypto community. The company stated that future Bitcoin purchases will depend on market conditions, Bitcoin's price, and Rumble's financial needs. 

Rumble's move into crypto and Bitcoin reflects a trend among public companies, such as MicroStrategy and Marathon Digital, which are adopting Bitcoin as part of their treasury management strategies. 

Last December, Tether made a $775 million investment in the platform, with a portion of the funds designated for growth initiatives.

In addition to its crypto investments, Rumble recently announced a cloud services partnership with the government of El Salvador, further solidifying its crypto ties.

On March 10, 2025, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) Managing Director Pierre Gramegna voiced apprehensions regarding the ramifications of U.S. President Donald Trump's cryptocurrency policies on Europe's financial stability. According to a recent report, Gramegna cautioned that the U.S. administration's endorsement of cryptocurrencies, especially dollar-backed stablecoins, could potentially threaten Europe's monetary autonomy.

During a Eurogroup press conference, Gramegna emphasized the urgent requirement for the European Central Bank (ECB) to expedite the digital euro's development. He reinforced that the digital euro is crucial for maintaining Europe's strategic autonomy as digital currencies gain influence globally. The ECB is slated to detail plans for the digital euro in Q2 2025, underlining the initiative's heightened pertinence.

In stark contrast, President Trump's administration is advocating for an expansive embrace of digital assets. The U.S. government has initiated several pro-crypto executive orders championing global growth in dollar-denominated stablecoins. Moreover, Trump's establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve alongside a digital asset stockpile highlights an ongoing debate regarding cryptocurrencies' place in the world economy, with stablecoin legislation anticipated by August 2025.

ECB President Christine Lagarde firmly clarified the institution's stance on cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, dismissing any inclusion within Europe's central bank reserves. Her position stresses the need for reserves that remain ""liquid, secure, and safe,"" thereby excluding volatile digital assets like Bitcoin.

Ireland's Finance Minister, Paschal Donohoe, reiterated the necessity for Europe to maintain a competitive edge in the digital currency landscape, with U.S. advancements potentially impacting Europe's economic stability. The ECB continues to expand its CBDC efforts, aiming to protect Europe's financial systems from the rising tide of U.S.-backed digital assets.

As the cryptocurrency industry rapidly evolves, Europe remains committed to fortifying its monetary independence amidst potential influences from American digital currencies, drawing on data provided by IndexBox to further strategize its positioning.

The initiative aims to issue more than $200 million in tokenized assets this year, more than doubling the platform's current total.

The partnership focuses on integrating Polygon's blockchain infrastructure into Mercado Bitcoin's tokenization process, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk.

“The Polygon network enables fast and affordable transactions, positioning MB as a technological and financial leader both in Latin America and globally,” said Fabrício Tota, Mercado Bitcoin's vice president of new business.

Rumble, a Toronto-headquartered video hosting, streamling and cloud platform, joins the corporate Bitcoin BTCUSD purchasing mania. The statement about $17.1 million Bitcoin BTCUSD added to the treasury comes 10 weeks after Tether's investment in Rumble.

$17,100,000: Video platform Rumble confirms first BTC purchase

According to its official statement, Canada's video streaming platform Rumble, disclosed its pioneering Bitcoin BTCUSD purchasing. The company has added 188 Bitcoins BTCUSD to treasury with an average price of $91,000 per coin, Rumble said in X.

In total, the company is going to allocate $20 million in Bitcoin BTCUSD, Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski said in a press release. 

The company bets big on Bitcoin BTCUSD ""as a valuable tool for strategic planning and reinforces the company's expansion into cryptocurrency,"" the team says.

Fueled by the announcement, Rumble's RUM stocks are up by 2.7% in 24 hours on Nasdaq's premarket. However, the X followers opined that the company might be getting exposure to Bitcoin BTCUSD on too high prices.

As of press time, Bitcoin BTCUSD is changing hands at $81,633. Rumble should be 10.33% underwater, with a negative paper PnL of $1.77 million.

Rumble jumps into top 40 corporate BTC holders

With this purchase, Rumble becomes the 40th largest corporate holder of Bitcoin BTCUSD, Bitcoin Treasuries tracker says. Rumble's BTC holdings are equal to 0.60% of its net market cap.

As covered by U.Today previously, in December 2024, Rumble secured a whopping $775 million investment from Tether, the issuer of the world's largest stablecoin, USDT.

In the first batch, Tether transferred to Rumble $250 million in cash. As such, the company injected into Bitcoin BTCUSD about 7% of the first Tether transfer.

In total, publicly listed companies are responsible for over 657,000 Bitcoins BTCUSD worth $53 billion; it is 3.13% of the entire Bitcoin BTCUSD supply.

Key Points

Bitcoin (BTC -0.66%) and XRP (XRP 2.13%) might not seem like direct competitors, but if you're looking to allocate a finite amount of money, you'll need to choose which one to put your dollars into. In that vein, even if you're willing to invest for the long term, you should probably have a sense of which investment might be more appealing.

At least for the moment, there's an emerging area that XRP is doing great with while Bitcoin is struggling. Here's why it could make XRP the better buy.

The blockchains that host Bitcoin and XRP have multiple capabilities beyond simply tracking which coins are in which wallets and allowing holders to execute transfers.

For instance, both aim to offer the ability for investors to buy, sell, create, and track real world assets (RWAs) like real estate or commodities directly on their chains. Although the push to onboard such assets to blockchains is just getting started, in the future it could be a major driver of volume and demand for these coins and others that offer the same features. So being a more convenient chain for investors looking to deal with real world assets, especially institutional investors, big banks, and other financial institutions, is an important factor when it comes to evaluating which coin is the better buy right now.

But there isn't much of a contest here. Bitcoin's transactions can take more than an hour to clear, and they cost about $0.37 at the absolute minimum. In contrast, XRP's transactions cost a fraction of a penny and close within a few seconds. It's also already in wide use by financial institutions for the purpose of transferring money quickly and inexpensively across international borders, so there's already a big cohort of users who might be interested in trading RWAs on their chain every day.

And the non-contest is about to get even more lopsided.

On March 22, XRP's chain will get an upgrade that will give it automated market maker (AMM) functionality, which will help to make all of the transactions on its chain more efficient for users, including those who are trading real world assets with each other. Thus, the prices that buyers are demanding will be closer to the actual transaction settlement price for their asset, and the prices that sellers are offering will be too. For financial institutions, capturing those small efficiencies can add up to large sums of money, so it's likely to be a key feature that will drive them to onboard more of their assets onto XRP's chain.

In contrast to XRP, Bitcoin doesn't natively support AMMs on its main blockchain, though several workarounds have been developed on its side chains. Therefore, it's an additional set of steps for investors if they want to trade RWAs with the help of an AMM on Bitcoin because they would need to bridge their assets over to the side chain before trading. This process is too technical for most investors who might be interested in holding some assets on the blockchain, and there are not yet any streamlined ways of doing it.

On the basis of the trend toward putting real world assets on the blockchain, XRP looks superior to Bitcoin.

Nonetheless, XRP isn't the only chain in the running to capture the market for trading RWAs, and this segment is very far from maturity. In other words, it could be supplanted by a more specialized chain that does the job even better. And for a chain dedicated to being favored by financial institutions, that would be a blow, albeit not an existential threat.

Bitcoin, on the other hand, only offers this type of functionality as an afterthought, at least for the moment. So it probably isn't going to be a significant driver of its price unless that changes. It doesn't need to win against XRP, as investors seek to buy and hold it as a store of value rather than for its utility.

The reality is that both Bitcoin and XRP are likely to continue growing, and they're both worth buying and holding. Bitcoin is the more conservative choice of the two, and so for most investors, it's probably the better option. Still, it's worth getting some exposure to XRP soon just in case it wins the fight to track assets on its chain.

Arsenal face PSV Eindhoven in their Champions League last-16 second leg with one foot in the quarters having won the first leg 7-1; Gunners are set to face the winners of Atletico Madrid's tie with Real Madrid in the last eight but which one would be preferable for them?

Wednesday 12 March 2025 18:25, UK

Paul Merson believes his former club Arsenal would be better off facing Atletico Madrid than Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals - do you agree?

The Gunners meet PSV Eindhoven in their last-16 second leg on Wednesday and are all but into the last eight already after their 7-1 first-leg win last week.

Mikel Arteta's side are set to face either Real Madrid or Atletico Madrid next, with Real holding a 2-1 first-leg lead ahead of Wednesday's return game at the Wanda Metropolitano.

The tie is finely poised but Merson feels the north Londoners will want to face Atletico rather than the Champions League holders.

When asked how far Arsenal can go in the competition, Merson told Sky Sports News: ""I think it depends on who wins out of Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid.

""I think if Atletico Madrid win, Arsenal have a bit of a chance. I think that'll be a tight game, Atletico Madrid don't blow anybody away - they play a certain style of football.

""But if they play against Real Madrid, I don't know if they're going to be able to live with them with goalscoring over two legs, especially with the players that are out for Arsenal.

""And I know they won 7-1 the other day, but it was a bit of a Polyfilla result. It covered over the cracks.""

Who do you think Arsenal would be better off facing? Read on as we make the case for both sides - and have your say in our poll.

Sky Sports' Oliver Yew:

Arsenal's problem since the turn of the year has been scoring goals.

Injuries are a key factor in that. Any team would lack a cutting edge when missing the likes of Bukayo Saka, Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus.

But the problem has been heightened when coming up against sides who pack their defence, playing with a low block, and that is becoming a common occurrence, especially in the Premier League.

It's nothing new for Arsenal but should they face Ateltico Madrid, Diego Simeone's side, they would know exactly what was coming. Atletico's resilient style looks tailor-made to cause Mikel Arteta's side plenty of problems.

We saw that in Arsenal's Europa League semi-final against Simeone's side in 2018, albeit Arsene Wenger was still in charge. Atletico, with 10 players, battled to a 1-1 draw at the Emirates Stadium before a 1-0 win in Madrid saw them reach the final as they went on to lift the trophy.

Last season also demonstrated the difficulties Arsenal face against defensive sides in Europe, with the Gunners needing penalties to get past a rugged Porto outfit in the last 16 of the Champions League.

There is one team who won't play a low block: Real Madrid.

Boasting the likes of Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham, Rodrygo and Vinicius Jr, it is not in their make-up. And while Real can blow any side out of the water on their day, their attacking style could help Arsenal.

We saw that against PSV, who left space for Arsenal to exploit.

It allowed Martin Odegaard to thrive and it was no surprise to see Arsenal click into gear to score seven with their captain pulling the strings.

Of course, Real Madrid have the star power to make Arsenal look silly. They are the holders and should not be underestimated.

But their style, over that of Atletico, might suit Arsenal in their current injury-ravaged guise.

Sky Sports' Nick Wright:

Atletico Madrid are a formidable opponent but does it really get any tougher than Real Madrid in this tournament?

The 15-time winners have won the competition more than twice as many times as any other club, including, of course, last season, when they overcame Borussia Dortmund at Wembley in the final.

They have not been at quite the same level as last term domestically. There were also some glimmers of vulnerability early in the Champions League league phase campaign, when they were beaten three times, by Lille, AC Milan and Liverpool. But do not be fooled.

They go into their second leg with Atletico having won their last six consecutive Champions League games, including both legs of their play-off double-header with Manchester City - and having smashed an incredible total of 19 goals in the process.

Their attacking firepower is surely unrivalled in European football, and although their defence is currently depleted by injuries, they remain a nightmare opponent, particularly in Europe.

There is of course their aura to consider too. The biggest factor in Real Madrid's European success is the quality of their players, but all those historic nights have also equipped them with a level of belief and durability that no other side possesses in this competition.

Consider how they beat Bayern Munich in last season's semi-finals, thanks to an extraordinary late double from substitute Joselu. Their victory over Manchester City at the same stage of the competition in 2021/22, which featured two stoppage-time goals from Rodrygo and an extra-time winner from Karim Benzema, was even more improbable. Only Real Madrid can do this.

They would hold that psychological advantage over Arsenal, as they would any side, and do not overlook their willingness to sit back and frustrate opponents, while waiting for opportunities to unleash Vinicius, Mbappe and the rest on the counter.

In last season's quarter-finals, they overcame Manchester City, eventually on penalties, while averaging roughly 34 per cent of the possession across the two legs. They are pragmatic under Carlo Ancelotti, himself a record five-time winner of the competition as a manager. They should be feared - more than Atletico.

The NFL's new year officially starts at 4 p.m. ET on Wednesday, and the New England Patriots still have work to do.

While the Patriots have agreed to deals with eight players since the league's legal tampering window opened on Monday, they have yet to land a starting left tackle or a No. 1 wide receiver. Will they use the ""official"" beginning of free agency to fill those needs, or will they explore other avenues for an upgrade?

It may be March 12, but it's a perfect day to wish your fellow NFL fans a Happy New Year.

The league's new league year begins at 4 p.m. ET on Wednesday, which will bring a flurry of free-agent signings, trades and more in the coming days. Already, handshake deals have been made thanks to the NFL's legal tampering period, but until pen is put to paper, nothing is official.

Several big names are still expected to sign or be traded within coming days. Aaron Rodgers and Russell Wilson are the two foremost passers to watch on the market, with both likely landing with new teams in the coming days or weeks.

Other quarterbacks have already found new homes, including Sam Darnold and Daniel Jones, while Amari Cooper and Stefon Diggs look to bolster depth charts across the NFL.

On the defensive side of the ball, Joey Bosa is reportedly set to join the Bills on a one-year deal, while Justin Reid is joining the Saints, leaving a relatively thin pool of top-tier defenders left.

USA TODAY Sports will provide the latest updates, signings, releases, rumors and more from NFL free agency below. All times are Eastern.

The Giants are adding versatile depth to their offensive line with the signing of former Seahawk Stone Forsythe to a contract. Terms have not yet been disclosed. Forsythe played in 53 games (including 14 starts) in his four years in Seattle with time at right and left tackle. The Giants' article on the signing includes Forsythe's experience playing on the interior as well during his time in college.

In early February, Kupp publicly announced that the Rams had informed him they would try to trade him this offseason. A trade never materialized ahead of the start of the new league year, so Los Angeles has informed the receiver it will release him today after eight years with the team. Kupp played in 12 games last season, recording 67 catches for 710 yards and six touchdowns.

Mariota, who served as the Commanders' backup to Jayden Daniels last year, is staying with the team on a one-year deal. NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported the contract is worth $8 million. The former No. 2 overall pick appeared in three games in 2024, compiling 364 yards, four passing touchdowns and zero interceptions to go with his 77.3% completion rate.

The Chargers announced Wednesday they've extended wide receiver Jalen Reagor. The terms of the deal have not been announced. Reagor played in eight games for Los Angeles in 2024, tallying seven catches for 100 yards.

The Jets have added edge rusher depth by agreeing to terms on a one-year deal with Weaver. The 27-year-old played three games for the Texans last year and spent time with Houston and the Los Angeles Rams' practice squads.

Dye signed a one-year deal with the Chargers last year, and he recorded career-high numbers in tackles (57) and sacks (1.5). The linebacker, who split time between defense and special teams, is returning to Los Angeles on a two-year, $5.5 million deal.

After releasing Tyler Lockett and trading DK Metcalf, the Seahawks have brought in reinforcement at the wide receiver position. Valdes-Scantling is signing a one-year, $5.5 million deal with Seattle after a year split between Buffalo and New Orleans.

Buffalo is signing former Commanders safety Darrick Forrest to a one-year deal. The 25-year-old spent most of the 2024 season playing on special teams. He hit free agency this year after four years with Washington, which drafted him in the fifth round of the 2021 NFL draft.

Though New York announced earlier in the offseason that it planned to part ways with their veteran quarterback, the team still hasn't made any move official. With hours to go before the new league year officially begins, the Jets still have not released Rodgers. Perhaps a trade is on the way to allow Gang Green to recoup some value from the 41-year-old gunslinger in the form of draft picks.

Rodgers is set to enter the final season of the three-year, $112.5 million contract he signed with the Jets in 2023. New York would take on a $23.5 million cap hit into June should it designate the quarterback a post-June 1 release. After that, Rodgers would be responsible for a $14 million cap hit in 2025 and $35 million cap hit in 2026.

Holding the Jets back from a potential trade is the fact that Rodgers has a no-trade clause in his contract, which would allow the quarterback to nix any potential deal.

Ford and the Falcons have agreed to terms on a two-year, $4 million deal. The defensive back is returning to Atlanta after two years in Cleveland. He has played primarily on special teams over the last five years.

For a third year in a row, Gaines is signing a one-year deal with Tampa Bay. Also for a third year in a row, that contract is worth $3.5 million. The defensive tackle has been a rotational piece in the Buccaneers' defensive front over the last two years and has recorded two sacks in that span.

Hamlin, 26, is coming off of one of the best seasons of his career in 2024. He had 89 tackles (two for a loss), five passes defensed, two interceptions and a fumble recovery in 14 starts. The Bills are extending Hamlin with a one-year deal, the value of which is still to be announced.

Coming off of a season with 24 catches for 276 yards and two touchdowns for the Steelers, the Brentwood, Tennessee native is heading home on a one-year, $2.5 million deal with the Titans.

Charles signed a one-year deal to be the Titans' starting right guard last year before suddenly retiring before the season began. Now the former fourth-round pick will attempt to return from retirement and hit the market as a free agent when the Titans release him to start the new league year.

Four months to the day after the Dolphins claimed Dodson off of waivers from the Seahawks, the two sides have agreed to terms on a two-year, $8.25 million deal. The linebacker tallied career-high marks in tackles (107), passes defensed (6) and interceptions (3) last season.

After three seasons with the Steelers, the 30-year-old defensive tackle will join the fourth team of his career on a one-year, $8.3 million contract. The deal includes $8 million in guarantees and incentives that could push the value to $10 million.

The Chiefs created nearly $50 million in cap space by restructuring the contracts of their star quarterback and defensive tackle. Yates points out the extra room is even more than Kansas City needed to officially sign free agents Kristian Fulton, Elijah Mitchell and Jaylon Moore when the new league year starts later on Wednesday.

Rumors had floated around throughout the day on Tuesday that Bosa would join his brother, Nick, in San Francisco. Instead, he'll fill in the Von Miller-sized hole in the Bills' pass-rush attack after agreeing to join Buffalo on a one-year, $12.6 million deal.

	“Throughout my career, I've always taken pride in being a bit of a connector and a community builder for other people. So it felt like the natural time to take that halo of what we had built with Boardroom on the media and event side, and to build this more intimate community where people could be very like-minded,” Kleiman tells The Hollywood Reporter in an interview. “I think the ages will range from as young as 25 to people in their mid-40s, early-50s. Because I think the beauty of it is that if you're interested in this world and you love the idea of building this community and this network, then you'll be very much inspired by the mix of people in this community, and then what we continue to give them.”


	Boardroom has also lined up a long list of advisers to the membership project, many of whom will participate in curating the programs. Those advisers include former NFL star turned TV personality Michael Strahan, musician Mark Ronson, CAA Sports co-head Mike Levine, and prolific on-air sports reporter Taylor Rooks, who will also serve as a strategic adviser to Boardroom.


	“I'm beyond thrilled to join Boardroom in this new capacity and broaden my involvement with a company that has been home to some of my favorite multimedia stories and live events at sports' biggest moments,” Rooks says. “Kevin Durant and Rich Kleiman have built something truly special — highlighting the intersection of sports, business, and entertainment in a way that pushes the industry forward. Boardroom represents everything at the heart of what I love about this business: relationships, knowledge, advancement, and opportunity. With Boardroom Members Club, we're creating a space where real connections lead to real possibilities, and I'm excited to play a vital role in shaping a community that empowers the next generation of leaders.”

	











	“I think that having them there as a resource as we build it is invaluable,” Kleiman says. “Having them implemented into the programming throughout the year, whether it's in the live fireside chats, or just being in the room when we create these networking events or having roundtable panels of discussion … If we find a contingency of our members that are really interested in private equity, we can set up a conversation on Zoom or in person with [investor] David Blitzer. I mean, these things are priceless for these for these people.”


	Kleiman says that Boardroom is targeting people who work in industries adjacent to sports and media, as well as some folks in the finance sector who want to have exposure to the sports and entertainment sectors. There will be athletes and managers, too.


	“I think it'll be industry people that work at Fanatics and CAA and Goldman Sachs and Nike,” Kleiman says. “It'll be athletes that are recently retired, or athletes that are currently playing that don't necessarily have the same connections or networks that some of the top players in football and basketball have. I think it'll be people that have graduated business school that are going to work in private equity or work in real estate or a hedge fund, but understand the value of having connectivity into the sports and entertainment space as well.”


	Boardroom previously partnered with Michael Rubin's Fanatics to launch a development program for pro athletes and their management teams. The participants in that program will receive complimentary access to the Boardroom Members Club.

By Kevin Sherrington



Before branding himself from now until eternity as the general manager who gave away Luka Doncic, Nico Harrison had a good thing going. Made moves both bold and shrewd to facilitate a Finals run.

Like that matters now. Nobody bragged on Edward Smith's medal from the Second Boer War after he sideswiped an iceberg in the Titanic.

Until the Luka deal, Nico was in the running for best GM in the market. He's since been lapped by both Jim Nill and Chris Young, though he remains ahead of Jerry Jones, who's been running the wrong direction for 30 years.

As usual, Jerry's under heavy fire for not throwing big money at anyone other than his own, and even then only when too late. Unlike last year, when he told us he was “all in,” then basically sat out the free agent market, he's shopping these days.

Walmart shopping.

Besides bringing back KaVontae Turpin on Tuesday, the Cowboys signed Solomon Thomas, the eight-year defensive tackle from Coppell, and got Payton Turner, a defensive end and former first-round pick of the Saints, on a one-year flyer. Thomas provides needed depth on the line. The appeal of Turner, a bust in New Orleans, is a low-risk, high-upside move that, like all the moves the Cowboys make in free agency, gives them cover going into the draft.

Over the last 10 years, the NFL's most valuable franchise has ranked last in the league in free agent spending. The Joneses' excuse is they choose to spend on their own. I could buy it if it meant they were winning with a draft-and-develop plan, except they're not.

In order to win Lombardi Trophies, you've got to be good at everything. Spending, drafting and dealing, too. Honk if you've heard this before, but where would Philadelphia be if Howie Roseman hadn't acquired Saquon Barkley? The Eagles draft well, spend near the top of the market and aren't afraid of the occasional blockbuster.

Players have come and gone from Eagles headquarters since the Super Bowl like it was a 7-Eleven, and my guess is Philly will have enough players to make another run at it this fall.

Meanwhile, Jerry, would it hurt to kick the tires on Amari Cooper?

Think what Jim Nill might do if only he ran the Cowboys. Would it matter if he didn't know a tackle from a tight end? The Cowboys have been at loose ends for 30 years. I'd take my chances.

Like Roseman, Nill does everything well. Lest you forget, his first big move was to trade for Tyler Seguin. Helps that, in Tom Gaglardi, he's got the backing of a good owner. His trust in Nill is well-earned. Nill hits so often on draft picks, he could afford to give up three firsts to build a roster to win now. He worked the nuances of the NHL's curious loosened financial restrictions on injured players to make a deal no one saw coming.

And, unlike the recent handiwork of another local GM, this deal didn't give you nightmares before you fell asleep.

Just how big was his trade last week for Mikko Rantanen?

Knocked the Mavs and Cowboys off the top of the sports page.

Nill's latest move gives him the lead by a nose over Chris Young, who had held the title since the Rangers won the last championship trophy in the market. He's working hard on the next. In fact, it's his motto.

You're only as good as your next championship trophy.

Jerry can only talk about the Lombardis with Jimmy's fingerprints all over them.

Did you like those Super Bowls? I hope you did. I hope you did very much.

Young, who hired the best Rangers manager ever, likes to swing big (Jacob deGrom, Corey Seager, Marcus Semien). Even so, as his bullpen work demonstrates, he can work around the edges, too.

He easily could have said last year's power outage was an anomaly and expected the lineup to flip the switch this year, but he didn't. He acquired Jake Burger and Joc Pederson. Pederson's off to a slow start, but here's betting Burger puts up better power numbers at first base than any Ranger since Mark Teixeira.

The world's tallest GM hates losing. Hates it. But he doesn't let his emotions get in the way of his job.

Which brings us back to Nico.

Frankly, as previously noted in this space, he didn't seem like the type who could turn the organization as well as the city upside down when Mark Cuban introduced him as his first official GM. Didn't seem like he could upset a tray of donuts. Everything went fairly smoothly right up to the announcement of the worst trade in the city's sports history.

We've since learned that, with Nico, it's his way or the highway. He prefers players with whom he has a long association. More times than not, it's worked. To his credit, he saw a side of Kyrie that others didn't. His opinion of Kyrie also tells you where it went wrong with Luka.

Consider Nico's statement after news of Kyrie's season-ending injury. Called his point guard the Mavs' “heart and soul.” Compared his work ethic and dedication, his “ferocity and passion” to Kobe Bryant's.

Now contrast those comments with everything you've heard from behind the scenes about Luka.

Now Mavs fans have to live with it, and they'll no doubt do so long after Nico's tenure here is over. That's where Jerry has a step on him. No matter what he does as GM, he's got the owner in his pocket.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=sports+news","Opinion: Women-dominated sports deserve NCAA recognition","https://nyunews.com/opinion/2025/03/12/women-dominated-sports-need-respect/","Wed, 12 Mar 2025 12:05:39 GMT","

Women have long been excluded from the world of professional sports — from not being allowed to run in the Olympic marathon until 1984 to the NCAA not recognizing women-dominated sports to this day. Despite Title IX prohibiting sex discrimination in educational athletics, decades of demanding equal pay and the highest number of women participating in sports ever, women are still only represented in about 5% of sports coverage and face inequitable pay compared to their male peers. These disparities are largely attributable to the fact that women, as well as sports dominated by women, are not taken seriously. The NCAA's lack of recognition for popular female-dominated sports — specifically cheer and dance — only perpetuates these stereotypes and inequities. 

Cheerleading was a male-only activity until the 1940s when college-aged men were drafted for World War II and women began to take up spots in the sport. By the 1950s, female participation in sports, including cheer, began to grow. In response to the sport no longer being male-dominated, colleges started to discourage men's participation in cheer and dismissed it as “solely a feminine occupation.” Its legitimacy as a sport has been questioned ever since. 

The NCAA defines a sport as “an institutional activity, sponsored at the varsity or club level, involving physical exertion for competition against teams or individuals within an intercollegiate competition structure… [that operates] under standardized rules with rating/scoring systems ratified by at least one official regulatory agency and/or governing body.” Historically, competitive cheer and dance teams fell short of being recognized by the NCAA because sidelining at games meant that these teams did not exist for the sole purpose of competing. The 2012 federal court ruling in Biediger v. Quinnipiac University reinforced the stance that varsity cheer must be “better organized and defined” before it could be considered for recognition as an official sport. 

Within the past decade, competitive dance and cheer has quickly developed. Over 3 million people in the United States participate in competitive cheer at various levels, 97% of those being women. No longer confined to the sidelines at games, cheer and dance teams now have competitions judged based on athleticism and difficulty. Organizations such as the Universal Cheerleaders Association, the Universal Dance Association, the National Cheer Alliance and the National Dance Alliance have implemented formal scoring systems strictly structured around creativity, execution and technical skills, as well as further regulations to precisely judge a sport that is performative and artistic at its core. UCA and UDA host national events with thousands of athletes representing over 182 schools, drawing in huge audiences in person and through online streaming. The growing prestige of the UDA's national events has earned it the nickname of the “Super Bowl” of college dance.

Heightened competitiveness in dance has put greater demands on these athletes. College dance and cheer teams must train just as intensely as any other sports team, including weight training, cardio and conditioning on top of scheduled practices. Judges and coaches are also demanding more challenging skills and tricks from athletes so teams can keep up with growing competition. These teams bring championships and national recognition to their respective universities, but still aren't counted as a sport by the NCAA. 

Though dance and cheer are often not considered rigorous athletics, they are frequently more demanding and dangerous than other, often male-dominated, sports. Competitive cheerleading has one of the highest injury rates of any sport, with catastrophic injuries occurring at higher rates than baseball, soccer and basketball. 

This is not only a matter of recognition, their lack of official status has financial consequences. The NCAA allocates nearly $3.5 billion in athletic scholarships every year. Only when recognized as an official sport can Division I and Division II teams recruit athletes with NCAA scholarships. Currently, cheer and dance teams do not receive any scholarships from the NCAA and get the same level of funding as club sports, which typically do not compete at the national level. As a result, cheer and dance programs depend on fundraising to cover competition fees, travel costs, uniforms and even coaches' salaries. If fundraising goals are not met, individual athletes may even have to pay out of pocket to continue competing. Athletes often find themselves denied access to university programs meant for student-athletes because of their lack of NCAA status, such as cheerleaders at Louisiana State University who were excluded from athletic meals. 

Dismissing women-dominated sports is not just an issue of semantics, but it actively harms athletes involved. It limits their access to scholarships and resources that allow them to compete safely at the highest level. Recognition from the NCAA would not only legitimize cheer and dance in colleges across the country, but would also make sure that female athletes are treated equally. If the NCAA was truly committed to gender equality in the realm of sports, proper recognition and funding would be allocated to women-dominated sports.

Washington will cohost Front Office Sports Today with Baker Machado

NEW YORK — Front Office Sports, the leading multiplatform media and news organization covering the business of sports, today announced veteran sports broadcaster Renee Washington is joining the company as a multiplatform host. She will serve as an on-camera personality and anchor the organization's flagship daily show, Front Office Sports Today, alongside Baker Machado, who joined FOS earlier this year. 

Washington has appeared as a sideline reporter or analyst on ESPN, Fox Sports, NBC Sports, SNY, FloSports, and many other networks. She most recently led Peacock's coverage of the U.S. Olympic Team Trials for Mixed Doubles Curling.

Washington was an NCAA Division I soccer player and three-time All-American at La Salle University. She went on to earn her master's in educational leadership from Lehigh University.

“From playing sports to covering them, I've always been intrigued by the business of leagues, teams, athletes, and brands,” said Washington. “I'm thrilled to be joining so many talented reporters at FOS and excited to take fans behind the scenes of the biggest stories in sports.”

Washington's addition comes as FOS builds out its portfolio of shows and video content, including Front Office Sports Today, Next Up with Adam Breneman, and Redefined with Leslie & Arielle, along with additional projects in development set to launch later this year.

The accolades for Memphis basketball star PJ Haggerty continue to pile up.

The 17th-ranked Tigers' sophomore guard earned second-team All-America honors by The Sporting News Wednesday. The news comes approximately 24 hours after Haggerty was announced as the AAC Player of the Year.  

Haggerty, who was the AAC Freshman of the Year at Tulsa last season and a first-team All-AAC selection this season, is averaging 21.2 points, tops in the league and tied for fifth in the nation; 5.5 rebounds (21st); 3.8 assists (tied for eighth); and 1.8 steals per game (tied for second).

The Sporting News is one of four organizations taken into account by the NCAA for its consensus All-America designation. The others − which have not yet released their All-America teams − are the Associated Press, the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA) and the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC).

The Tigers have not had a consensus All-American since Chris Douglas-Roberts in 2008. Memphis' other consensus All-Americans are Larry Finch (1973), Keith Lee (1983-85), Penny Hardaway (1993), Lorenzen Wright (1996) and Rodney Carney (2006).

The Sporting News' first-team All-Americans are Duke's Cooper Flagg, Auburn's Johni Broome, Purdue's Braden Smith, Alabama's Mark Sears and Florida's Walter Clayton. Joining Haggerty on The Sporting News' second team are Marquette's Kam Jones (a Memphis native who prepped at ECS), Villanova's Eric Dixon, Texas Tech's JT Toppin and Wisconsin's John Tonje.

Third-team honorees are Creighton's Ryan Kalbrenner, Houston's LJ Cryer, St. John's RJ Luis, Tennessee's Zakai Ziegler and Tennessee's Chaz Lanier.

Haggerty has also been recognized as a first-team All-American by NCAA digital reporter Andy Katz and a third-team All-American by College Sports Today and The Field of 68's John Fanta.

“I would say it's a blessing, just being in the position I am – it wouldn't be (possible) without my team, coaches and all the hard work I put in,” Haggerty said Tuesday. “I would just say a blessing from God.”

Haggerty is also among five finalists for the Jerry West Shooting Guard of the Year Award. He's also one of 15 finalists for the Wooden Award, which goes to the top player in college basketball.

The Tigers (26-5), who won the league regular-season championship, are set to face the Wichita State-South Florida winner in the quarterfinals of the AAC tournament Friday (noon CT, ESPN2) at Dickies Arena in Fort Worth, Texas.

News

The IBSF Bobsleigh & Skeleton World Championships Lake Placid 2025 are in full swing, with the 2-woman and 4-man bobsleigh teams set to battle it out at this pinnacle of sliding on Friday and Saturday (14 and 15 March).

Legendary location

This year's IBSF World Championships are taking place at a location that is truly legendary for our sports. It was here over 95 years ago that the first bobsleds sped down North America's first-ever sliding track built at Mt Van Hoevenberg, Lake Placid. Since that historic day in 1930, this village nestled in the Adirondack Mountains in Northern New York has been an international powerhouse in the sport.

Olympic legacy omnipresent 

Lake Placid hosted the Olympic Winter Games in 1932 and in 1980 and the legacy is omnipresent. It's not only the track (rebuilt twice) and wider venues, but also the surroundings, the local people and the enormous passion for winter sports that makes this place feel very special.

Over the decades and previous to these World Championships, Lake Placid has hosted 10 bobsleigh and skeleton world championships between 1949 and 2012. As historically significant as this track already is, having hosted so many major international sliding events, it has also played an instrumental role in the development of women's sliding sports, with the creation of a new women's bobsled program in 1981.

Once-in-a-generation revitalization

Today, after a once-in-a-generation series of revitalization projects that have lifted Lake Placid's Olympic track and wider venues to world-class level, there are now more opportunities than ever for athlete development and major events, with a multitude of wider benefits for anyone planning a visit to this venue and region.  

Last year, Lake Placid counted over a million visits, offering a wide range of touristic activities that include bobsleigh and skeleton initiations – on ice in winter and on wheels in summer. Local school children are also regularly invited to take advantage, with a big focus on instilling a passion for winter sports in the next generation from an early age. The facilities – and their economic impact and social legacy - are managed by the New York State Olympic Regional Development Authority (Olympic Authority).

Global athletes calling Lake Placid home

With its outstanding facilities, the Mt. Van Hoevenberg Combination Bobsled, Skeleton & Luge Track is also called “home track” by a number of world-class athletes who are competing and medaling at IBSF Bobsleigh & Skeleton World Championships Lake Placid 2025.

It's perhaps no surprise that several high profile Team USA athletes call this track home - including Mystique Ro, who just last week won silver in women's skeleton and a day later gold in the mixed skeleton team event which will make its debut at Milano-Cortina 2026. She is joined by multiple Olympic medalist Elana Meyers Taylor who came third in women's monobob on Sunday and Frank Del Duca who finished 4th in the 2-man bobsleigh.

Future is bright for Jamaica 

Jamaica Bobsleigh, before making its famous debut at 1988 Calgary Olympic Games, was training in Lake Placid - and ever since has been coming back. In fact, thanks to this close link with Lake Placid, Jamaica Bobsleigh has undergone seismic transformations.

Just last week at the IBSF Bobsleigh & Skeleton World Championships, Jamaica's two-man team of pilot Shane Pitter and brakeman Tyquendo Tracey made history at their first World Championship scoring Jamaica's second best ever performance between a World Championship and Olympic Games.

Adanna Johnson, just 17, also now has her eyes on Milano-Cortina 2026 after breaking into Women's monobob heat 4 alongside multiple Olympic medalists - she could be joining a Jamaica Bobsleigh team heading to their ninth Olympic Games with athletes in every Olympic discipline!

International collaboration

By expanding partnerships and programs, and hosting many extraordinary international competitions, Lake Placid remains a top destination for winter sport athletes and tourists.

The venue also works with other former Olympic hosts to learn from each other, promote winter sports and foster economic collaboration. Just last week during the IBSF World Championships, the mayors of Lake Placid and PyeongChang, Korea (host of the 2018 Olympic Winter Games) signed a Declaration of Friendship as a commitment to collaboration, cultural exchange and mutual support between the cities and municipalities.

The shared objective locally and globally: inspire the next generation of athletes!

TV advertisers in the US spent US$244 million on women's sports in 2024, an increase of 139 per cent year-over-year (YoY), according to a report by EDO.

Spots during the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) women's basketball tournament were 18 per cent more effective than the primetime average

EDO's report highlighted that brands generated strong results when pairing ads featuring women athletes and sports themes during games. For instance, CarMax was 185 per cent more effective than the average WNBA advertiser via ads that featured the league's stars. 

As well as noting that women's basketball was continuing its ‘meteoritic rise', EDO also found that a new crop of women's sports is gaining traction with viewers, with advertisers subsequently taking notice. Notably, the 2024 NCAA women's volleyball championship game between Penn State and Louisville was deemed to be 51 per cent more effective for advertisers than the average primetime programme. In addition, women's college gymnastics and college lacrosse posted YoY ad effectiveness growth of 15 per cent and 26 per cent, respectively.

“Women's sports has officially graduated from TV advertising's best-kept secret to one of its most reliable performers,” said Laura Grover, senior vice president and head of client solutions at EDO. 

Grover believes that the cultural momentum behind women's sports is “unstoppable”, adding that it is an “increasingly risky bet” for brands still opting not to get involved.

🏀 Automatic bids: Gonzaga, UNC Wilmington, Robert Morris and Saint Francis won their conference tournaments to punch their tickets to the NCAA men's tournament, while Oregon State and Green Bay secured spots in the women's field.

🏈 Free agency tracker: The Vikings signed Will Fries (five years, $88M) and Jonathan Allen (three years, $60M); the Colts signed Daniel Jones (one year, $14M); the Bills signed Joey Bosa (one year, $12.6M); the Ravens signed DeAndre Hopkins (one year, $6M)… Full list of moves.

🏀 Wild finish: Tyrese Haliburton pulled off a ridiculous 4-point play in the final seconds against the Bucks to lift the Pacers to a 115-114 victory in front of their home crowd. Both teams are now 36-28 on the season.

⚽️ Poch's picks: USMNT manager Mauricio Pochettino named his 23-man roster for next week's Nations League finals, which will be his first real test since taking over as manager in September.

📺 Big number: The Celtics-Lakers clash on Saturday night in Boston drew an average of 4.61 million viewers on ABC, the largest audience for an NBA regular-season game in seven years (not including Christmas Day).

The SEC tournament begins today in Nashville, where the champion of arguably the greatest league in men's college basketball history will be crowned.

Chasing history: The 2011 Big East landed a record 11 teams in the NCAA tournament. This year's SEC could get as many as 14. Yes, you read that correctly: A conference with 16 teams could realistically send 14 of them to The Big Dance.

Locks (9): No. 3 Auburn, No. 4 Florida, No. 5 Alabama, No. 8 Tennessee, No. 14 Texas A&M, No. 15 Kentucky, No. 21 Missouri, Ole Miss and Mississippi State.

Probably in (4): Georgia, Vanderbilt, Arkansas (""Last Four Byes"") and Oklahoma (""Last Four In"") are currently projected to make the 68-team field, per Bracketology.

On the bubble (1): Texas is currently among the ""First Four Out"" but could play its way in with a strong showing this week.

Need a miracle (2): LSU and South Carolina, the league's only teams under .500, will need to win the conference tournament to secure a spot.

Best league ever? This year's SEC has the best non-conference winning percentage (.889) since at least 1997, and the second-best margin of victory during that time, per KenPom.

They went 32-16 against the current KenPom top 50, including wins over the current AP No. 1 (Duke), No. 2 (Houston), No. 6 (St. John's), No. 9 (Texas Tech) and No. 10 (Clemson) teams.

The league is projected to land the No. 1 overall seed (Auburn), six top-4 seeds and boasts four of the six favorites (Auburn, Florida, Alabama, Tennessee) to cut down the nets.

The problem with so many great teams? An unprecedented number of bids for the SEC is bound to create a headache for the selection committee, writes Yahoo Sports' Jeff Eisenberg.

The more NCAA tournament bids that the SEC receives, the tougher it will be for the selection committee to adhere to its bracketing principles. Opening-round matchups between teams from the same conference are flatly forbidden. Those matchups are also avoided whenever possible in the round of 32 and the Sweet 16.

""They'll still try to avoid having teams from the same conference meet as much as possible, but the first priority is keeping everyone on their true seed line,"" said David Worlock, the NCAA's media coordinator for March Madness.

Looking ahead: Historic regular-season success doesn't guarantee anything in the crucible that is March Madness. To wit, the two best leagues ever by non-conference scoring margin (1997 ACC and 2024 Big 12) sent a combined one team to the Elite Eight. If the 2025 SEC wants to cement its place as the best ever, it will need to show up when it matters most.

Lamine Yamal sparked Barcelona into the Champions League quarterfinals on Tuesday, adding to a growing-but-already-quite-large sample size of greatness.

From Yahoo Sports' Henry Bushnell:

Lamine Yamal is 17 years old and sometimes — when he's not scoring Champions League goals, or flooring defenders, or leading Barcelona to the top of La Liga — he looks it. He still wears dental braces. He gets his secondary school exam scores in June.

And at other times, he looks like the best soccer player in the world. Because even at 17, he might be. That's no longer a reactionary, exaggerated claim.

There's a hesitance to anoint him because there are dozens of great players whose résumés are more extensive. There is Rodri, the reigning Ballon d'Or winner. There is Mo Salah, who has had the best 2024-25 season of anybody in world football. There are Kylian Mbappé and Vinicius Jr., who have been doing Lamine-like things for much longer.

But Yamal, at least on occasion, looks like a more complete player. He leads La Liga in assists and goal-creating actions. His progressive dribbling numbers are nearly on par with Vini's. And so is his sauce. Some of his on-ball skills are mind-boggling. His personal list of ""defenders I made look silly"" is already ridiculously long.

""I think it's silly to compare him to Messi, because Messi is unique and there will never be anyone like him,"" Gavi, Yamal's Spain and Barcelona teammate, said in January. But then he continued: ""Lamine, for me, is the best today.""

Cleveland — The Cavaliers were all smiles on Tuesday after beating the Nets to improve to 55-10 (tied for the fifth-best start in NBA history) and record their second 15-game winning streak of the season. The last team to do that? The 2006-07 Suns.

Tiger Woods underwent surgery on Tuesday for a ruptured Achilles, an injury that will in all likelihood keep him out of all four majors this season.

From Yahoo Sports' Jay Busbee:

We're not going to see Tiger Woods playing golf any time soon. But if you think we'll never see Tiger Woods play golf again… think again. It would be easy to declare Woods' career over — another surgery, another lost year in a career that has precious few years left to give.

It would be easy… and it would be wrong. Tiger Woods isn't going out like this. He'll be back, one way or another. When he leaves the game of golf, it will be on his own terms.

This isn't to say he'll ever lift another trophy. Woods will almost surely end up forever three short of Jack Nicklaus' 18 majors. He'll almost certainly remain tied with Sam Snead for most PGA Tour victories at 82. And yet… you wouldn't bet your house against Woods, would you?

Because just when you think he's out, he rallies back to win the U.S. Open on a broken leg, or win the Masters one more time. Woods built his career on dominance, but he sustained it on resilience. Underestimate either one, and you'd be in the clubhouse signing your scorecard well before he was.

The Cleveland Cavaliers didn't have Donovan Mitchell, De'Andre Hunter or Ty Jerome on Tuesday night, but they still rallied from an 18-point, third-quarter deficit to defeat the Brooklyn Nets, 109-104.

Cleveland won its 15th consecutive game, the second time this season the Cavaliers have strung together that many wins in a row. The Cavs also became the first NBA team this season to win their division, clinching the Central Division with 17 games remaining before the playoffs.

""Division champions is pretty cool,"" Cavaliers head coach Kenny Atkinson said after the game, via Cleveland.com. “I know us old-school guys, we like that. Maybe not so much for the new generation, but that means something. We'll put a banner up in our practice facility, [general manager] Koby [Altman] just told me, so that's pretty cool.""

""But 15 in a row,"" he added, ""and to do it at this juncture of the season with fatigue and teams like Brooklyn coming here playing super-hard and people trying to knock us off. It's really quite an accomplishment.""

At 55-10, Cleveland has also compiled the eighth-best start in NBA history.

Darius Garland came through in the clutch to secure Cleveland's 18-PT comeback and 15th straight win! 🏀 18 PTS in 4Q (30 for the game)🏀 2 STL in 4Q (4 for the game)🏀 8 AST pic.twitter.com/xvBq6Mq5rk

— NBA (@NBA) March 12, 2025

The Nets took a 71-53 lead at 9:53 of the third quarter on a 3-pointer by Ziaire Williams. But the Cavs cut the deficit to 86-78 by the end of the frame, fueled by seven points from Jarrett Allen and Craig Porter Jr. banking in a 3 from nearly 3/4-court at the buzzer.

Darius Garland took control in the fourth, scoring eight points to lift Cleveland to a 94-94 tie with 7:35 remaining in regulation. One minute later, Isaac Okoro put the Cavs on top with a drive to the basket and they stayed ahead for the rest of the game.

Tuesday's comeback was the fifth time the Cavs have rallied after trailing by 15 points or more and the 12th time they've won after a double-digit deficit this season.

Garland finished with 30 points — 18 of them in the fourth quarter — with eight assists and four steals. Allen followed with 23 points and 13 rebounds, and Evan Mobley added 21 points, nine rebounds and six assists.

Cam Thomas led the Nets with 27 points, followed by 17 from Cameron Johnson and 14 by Williams. Brooklyn has lost nine of its past 11 games, dropping to 22-43 and a tie with the Toronto Raptors for the third-worst record in the Eastern Conference.

The Cavaliers have a tough obstacle in extending their winning streak to 16, visiting the Memphis Grizzlies (41-24) on Friday. Mitchell, Hunter and Jerome are expected to be back in the lineup. After hosting Orlando (30-36) on Sunday, Cleveland goes on a five-game Western road trip.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

Andrej Jakimovski had 18 points, Julian Hammond III added 16 and Colorado was perfect at the foul line in the final 20 seconds, allowing the 16th and last seed in the Big 12 Tournament to hold on for a 69-67 victory over No. 9 seed TCU on Tuesday.

Hammond made a pair of foul shots for the Buffaloes (13-19) with 20 seconds left for a 67-65 lead, and after TCU answered with a goal-tending call at the other end, Javon Ruffin made two more free throws with 5.8 seconds left to put the game away.

Though it's not what he wanted, Cooper Kupp is on the move.

The Los Angeles Rams have informed Cooper Kupp that he will be released Wednesday, per NFL Network's Tom Pelissero. The move came after the team started looking for a trade partner for Kupp, though a deal never materialized. So the Rams instead opted to simply move on.

[Yahoo Fantasy Bracket Mayhem is back: Enter for a shot to win up to $50K]

Kupp has spent his entire eight-year career with the Rams. They selected him in the third round of the 2017 draft out of Eastern Washington, and he quickly became a key piece in their offense.

He erupted during their Super Bowl run during the 2021 season, and he helped lead the team to just their second championship in history while earning Super Bowl MVP honors. Kupp had 1,947 yards and 16 touchdowns on 145 catches that season, all of which led the league. He also averaged an NFL-best 114.5 yards per game.

Kupp's production has declined since. He had 710 receiving yards and six touchdowns on 67 catches this past season. The Rams went 10-7 and reached the playoffs, but were eliminated by the Philadelphia Eagles in the divisional round. Kupp had seven catches for 90 yards in the postseason.

The move came about a month after Kupp made the shocking announcement that the Rams were shopping him ahead of the Super Bowl.

""I don't agree with the decision and always believed it was going to begin and end in L.A.,"" Kupp wrote in an emotional social media post on Feb. 3, in part. ""Still, if there's one thing that I have learned over the years: there are so many things that are out of your control, but it is how you respond to these things that you will look back on and remember.""

Soon to be 32, Kupp had two years left on his three-year, $80 million deal. He was owed $20 million next season and just shy of that mark in 2026.

Now that he's been released, Kupp is expected to have interest from multiple teams. While he hasn't been anywhere near as good as he was during his peak, Kupp is still absolutely capable of making an impact on the field. Once he's with a new franchise, he'll have the chance to do just that.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

File photo by Ari Selvey
Sleepy Eye St. Mary's freshman Olivia Schieffert (2) looks for an open player during the Knights' Section 2A title game with BOLD on March 7 at Bresnan Arena in Mankato.

MINNEAPOLIS — Last time the Sleepy Eye St. Mary's girls basketball team made the state tournament it was 2021. COVID-19 regulations were still in place, and so the team did not get the full state tournament experience that year.

“It was COVID, and I went and watched the one game,” St. Marys' Amelia Schwartz said. “It was fun, but it wasn't everything you wanted when you go to the state tournament.”

Schwartz was still on the JV team that year, but this time she gets to make the full trip with the rest of her team as the team's lone senior starter.

“I'm super excited,” Schwartz said. “And I think the rest of our team is just over the moon.”

St. Mary's head coach Bruce Woitas said the team is taking full advantage of the experience of going to the state tournament.

“I think it's going to be a lot of fun,” he said. “They've worked really hard throughout the year to earn this opportunity and we're going to try to take full advantage of it and get that full experience. There's a banquet on Tuesday night [March 12] that we're going to have the kids come up to and we're going to come back up on Thursday and do our best to try to compete and represent our section. I think the kids are going to be excited for it, and we're excited for them as well.”

St. Mary's is seeded third in the tournament and will be taking on the sixth-seeded Sacred Heart Eagles in the first round of the tournament at 5 p.m. at the Maturi Pavilion at the University of Minnesota. Sacred Heart went 24-6 this season and comes out of Section 8 in the far northwest of Minnesota. The Eagles average 63.6 points per game and give up an average of 48.2 points. St. Mary's, meanwhile, averages 75.8 points for and 40 points against.

“From what we've seen so far from them, they're also a very young team as we are,” Woitas said. “I believe they start four sophomores. They have a little bit of size, the have two six-footers [Lydia Riskey and Lexi Lawrence], so they try to really emphasize their inside game as well. Based off of what we've seen, we really like the matchup that we have, so we feel pretty good about that matchup that we bring. 

“They look like they're going to be a really scrappy team as well, looks like they're going to play more of a man-to-man type defense and apply some pressure and stuff like that. Something that we haven't seen for a while, so hopefully we're going to be ready for it and it should be a fun battle.”

St. Mary's has a smaller team this year, but also a quick one. When it comes to taking on bigger teams, Woitas said they are likely to front taller player to prevent them from getting post touches.

“We're going to emphasize that,” Woitas said. “We're going to play frontside with denial and have backside help if we can get that. That's one way we've been playing really good of late is our defense has been really effective in man-to-man, and if we can do that — obviously BOLD had a couple of girls as well too and we defended them pretty well — if we can do what we've been doing for 31 games so far this year and just continue that, there's going to be opportunities to play well.”

St. Mary's perhaps had a strong test-run of that strategy three times this year against Martin County West. MCW's top scorer, Emily Anderson, stands at 5-10 and is a skilled post scorer and led the Mavericks to a 23-7 season, but the Knights defeated the Mavericks in all three of their matchups this season.

St. Mary's comes into the game with a 27-2 record and hope to continue their success in defending the basketball and getting the ball to multiple scorers. 

“We had a slow start to the BOLD game offensively,” Woitas said. “So we've got to make sure that every possession is going to be important. We've got to have good positive possessions throughout the game. And in a game like this, you're probably going to have some times where there's going to be some swings of momentum, and we're just going to have to be ready to answer those and try to stay in the game for those 36 minutes.”

The 2025 Players Championship field features 144 of the world's best golfers vying for a $25 million purse, making it one of the most lucrative tournaments on the PGA Tour. The champion will collect $4.5 million and 750 FedEx Cup points. The Players Championship 2025 gets underway from TPC Sawgrass on Thursday, March 13. The 2025 Players Championship first-round tee times begin at 7:40 a.m. ET.

Two-time defending champion Scottie Scheffler is the +360 favorite (risk $100 to win $360), according to the latest 2025 Players Championship odds. He's followed by Rory McIlroy (+800), Collin Morikawa (+1600), Xander Schauffele (+1600), Ludvig Aberg (+2000), and Justin Thomas (+2000) on the PGA odds board. Scheffler is -225 (risk $225 to win $100) to finish inside the top 10, while McIlroy is +230 (risk $100 to win $230) to crack the top five. Should your 2025 Players Championship picks include backing one of the favorites, or should you look at a longshot like Jason Day (+6500), who won this event in 2016? Before locking in your 2025 Players Championship picks, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.

SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up nearly $9,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.

This same model has also nailed a whopping 13 majors entering the weekend, including the 2024 Masters -- its third Masters in a row -- and last year's PGA Championship and U.S. Open. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting apps like FanDuel, DraftKings and Fanatics. 

Now that the 2025 Players Championship field is locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard.

One major surprise the model is calling for at the 2025 Players Championship: Xander Schauffele, a nine-time PGA Tour champion and one of the top favorites, stumbles this week and barely cracks the top 10. Schauffele secured a T-2 finish at the Players Championship in 2024 but has dealt with injuries and inconsistent play early in 2025. 

Schauffele is coming off a T-40 showing at the Arnold Palmer Invitational last week, his first start back from a rib injury that kept him sidelined since The Sentry, where he finished T-30 in January. Schauffele's rusty return from injury was magnified with his short game at the Arnold Palmer Invitational. He lost 2.84 strokes putting in Round 1 and lost 1.79 shots around the greens. He's not a strong pick to win it all and there are far better values in the 2025 Players Championship field. See who else to fade here.  

Another surprise: Hideki Matsuyama, a 30-1 longshot, makes a strong run at the title. He has a much better chance to win it all than his odds imply, so he's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday.

Matsuyama has had tremendous success at TPC Sawgrass in recent years. The 2021 Masters champion has finished T-6 or better in his last two starts at the Players Championship. He's an 11-time winner on the PGA Tour, which includes finishing on top of the leaderboard at The Sentry in January. Matsuyama enters this week's event ranked sixth in strokes gained: total (1.641), 12th in strokes gained: tee-to-green (1.167) and 13th in one-putt percentage (44.21%). Those impressive stats, plus his long odds, make him a strong value pick for your 2025 Players Championship bets. See who else to pick here.  

The model is also targeting three other golfers with odds of 30-1 or longer who will make a strong run at the title. Anyone who backs these longshots could hit it big. You can only see the model's picks here.

Who will win the 2025 Players Championship, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

Madelia's Tate Becker looks to score on a layup while guarded by Springfield's Brecken Heiling during a Section 2A Boys Basketball Tournament semifinals game Monday night at Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter.

MANKATO — There's been a bit of a numbers theme to the Madelia Blackhawks boys basketball season so far.

For starters, their 23 wins to this point in the season are the most in program history. Secondly, their Section 2A semifinals win over top-seeded Springfield on Monday was a case of the third time being the charm. Last but not least, a win Thursday would give Madelia its first state appearance in boys basketball since 1953.

After falling to Springfield twice in the regular season, Madelia got payback in the section semifinals with a 69-63 win to light up an energetic Madelia crowd in attendance at Gustavus Adolphus College and send the Blackhawks to this Thursday's 6 p.m. section title game at Bresnan Arena in Mankato. 

Standing in the way of a section title and state berth for Madelia will be a strong BOLD team. The second-seeded Warriors took down third-seeded Cedar Mountain 62-53 in overtime to advance to Thursday.

Madelia head coach Jeff Van Hee said his biggest area of concern dealing with the Warriors will be matching their physicality.

“Physically, you can tell they're in the weight room, pretty strong kids,” Van Hee said. “You can tell they bulk up, they've been traditionally good at football … so that's something we have to be concerned with. Can we physically match that strength and not get knocked around the floor.”

While it's been over 75 years since Madelia has seen the state tournament, BOLD is looking to make it to state for the first time in program history. Bird Island-Lake Lillian made it to the state boys basketball tourney and won the Class A state title in both 1980 and 1981, while Olivia advanced to state in 1919.

“I think for both teams this is kind of monumental,” BOLD head coach Dan Gross said. “I know BOLD hasn't been to this point in the season for boys basketball. … I think [Madelia] made it to state in 1953 I read, but for both communities this is huge. It's really exciting for everybody and to be a part of it is just awesome.”

When it comes to handling the Warriors, one dynamic player boasting muscle and finesse that Madelia will need to keep an eye on is 6-foot-5 senior guard Jack Gross, who leads BOLD with 21.4 points and 5.4 assists per game.

“[Jack] played with the Stars AAU team when Ja'[Sean Glover] was a senior, he was out there playing Stars with a younger age,” Van Hee said. “I also remember seeing him the year we went to the subsection championship when Ja' was a senior. BOLD lost to St. Mary's that year [in 2022] and I got to see him play there. He's a hard guard. He's left-handed, he's long and he's a three-level scorer.”

The Warriors are also led by 6-foot-3 senior forward Will Penkert, who is averaging 19.8 ppg and a team-best 7.1 rebounds per game. Penkert is also shooting a team-high 41% from beyond the arc.

BOLD 6-foot-3 junior forward Owen Baumgartner adds 7.8 ppg and 5.8 rpg to the lineup.

Madelia is led by freshman Kaydon Firchau's 22.2 points, 6.5 rebounds and 4.5 assists per game, while senior Hayden Jones averages 19 ppg and 3.8 rpg. Senior Josiah DeMaris is averaging 11.1 points per game also for the Blackhawks and shooting a team-high 40.2% clip from beyond the arc. Jones is shooting 37.3% from the 3-point line, while Firchau is shooting 37.2% from long range.

Madelia gets the majority of its rebounds from senior Kyle Pietsch (7.7 rpg) and junior Tate Becker (6.8 rpg).

Getting something from everyone has taken Madelia this far and it's something that has stood out to coach Gross.

“They're a well-rounded team,” he said. “The freshman guard [Kaydon Firchau], he's really good, but the senior nucleus, having that just keeps them well grounded and you can see the thought process there of next play and they don't get overemotional on anything. Defensively, they're athletic, they're quick, they're handsy. And offensively, pick your poison with them because when [Firchau] gets downhill, Jones and DeMaris standing in the corners are both excellent weapons.”

Countering BOLD's muscle with the speed, awareness and defensive intensity the Blackhawks showed against Springfield Monday will be key for Van Hee's squad Thursday.

Despite BOLD's size and toughness, Van Hee said he expects to see the same level of competitiveness his players have shown all season.

“I'm confident in our guys that we'll come out and compete,” Van Hee said. “We'll address it in a sense that, ‘Hey, this is who they are and this is what we need to do to offer resistance on defense for them.' Offensively, we're the team we are. We share the ball. Obviously Kaydon makes it go, so they're going to be probably hawking him everywhere, but we've just got to set good screens and that was a key to [Monday] night's game.”

Coach Gross said being aware of Madelia's shooters and limiting them will be key Thursday.

“Madelia, they're an excellent shooting team,” coach Gross said. “We get by on grit, grind and play good defense, bring good energy and our defense leads to our offense. Madelia, from what I can see, has some excellent shooters.”

Could one of LIV Golf's most notable stars be laying the groundwork for a return to the PGA Tour? He's not saying no.

Brooks Koepka, five-time major winner and the most decorated player of his generation, has always kept LIV at something of an arm's length. Where fellow stars like Bryson DeChambeau and Phil Mickelson have wholeheartedly embraced the LIV ethos, sporting their team logos at every opportunity, Koepka has always been more muted in his LIV fandom. Case in point: His response when asked about his future with the Saudi-backed golf league.

Prior to LIV's Hong Kong event, Koepka was asked about recent comments by Fred Couples that seemed to indicate he was interested in a return to the PGA Tour. (Couples' comments provoked a fiery, and quickly deleted, social media reaction from Mickelson.)

Koepka didn't exactly shower LIV with love in his response. ""I've got a contract obligation out here to fulfill,"" Koepka said, ""and then we'll see what happens."" As statements of loyalty go, that isn't exactly ride-or-die.

Couples made waves when he told a radio show that Koepka ""wants to come back. I will say that I believe he really wants to come back and play the Tour."" That provoked Mickelson to declare, “If it's not true he damaged a relationship which he cares about. If it is true he took away Brook's [sic] control of the timeline and narrative. Either way this is a low-class jerk move by Fred.”

Koepka has little use for these kinds of he-said, he-said back-and-forths in the media. He added on Wednesday that, ""Everybody seems to have their own opinion and no one asks me,"" in response to being asked about Couples' comment.

When Koepka jumped to LIV in 2022, he signed what is believed to be a contract through the 2026 season worth $100 million. (LIV does not release details of player contracts.) Koepka remains one of the biggest draws in the LIV circuit, primarily because of his ability to contend in virtually every major.

However, the state of golf is in such flux that it's impossible to guess whether Koepka's contract will remain in force through 2026, or whether LIV itself will even exist in its current form in 2026.

""I don't know where I'm going, so I don't know how everybody else does,"" Koepka said. ""Right now I'm just focused on how do I play better, how do I play better in the majors, how does this team win, and then we'll figure out next year and how to play better again. It's the same thing. It's just a revolving cycle. I've got nothing. Everybody else seems to know more than I do.""

That might be the only real flaw in Koepka's line of thinking ... because nobody seems to know more than anyone else about where golf is headed.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

Florida guard Walter Clayton Jr. is a First Team All-American, according to The Sporting News.

The outlet announced its 2024-25 College Basketball All-America Teams Wednesday morning, including Clayton in the top tier. Auburn forward Johni Broome, Duke forward Cooper Flagg, Alabama guard Mark Sears and Purdue point guard Braden Smith make up the rest of the First Team. Clayton is the first Florida player to be named to the First Team and the sixth Gator named to any All-America team by The Sporting News.

""A year ago, Clayton functioned primarily as a shooter and scorer and averaged just 2.6 assists, which was fine because that was not his job. From the jump this year, though, Florida installed Clayton as its (primary) ballhandler and was given no reason to regret the decision. Clayton's scoring fell by less than half a point per game, but his assists were up by nearly two and his turnovers were nearly flat.""

College basketball columnist Mike DeCourcy praised Clayton for his consistency at the point guard position for Florida and said his play was a ""huge reason"" Florida finished the regular season at the top of the SEC. DeCourcy picked Clayton's 22-point, 8-assist and 5-rebound night in a road win against Alabama one week ago as the defining game of his season.

Heading into the SEC Tournament, which begins Wednesday, Clayton is averaging 17.2 points, 4.3 assists, 3.8 rebounds and 1.2 steals per game while shooting 44.1% from the field. The Gators have a two-round bye after finishing second overall in the conference. To win the SEC Tournament, Florida will need to go 3-0 over the weekend.

PARKERSBURG — After scoring a 24-point win over Huntington less than a month ago the Parkersburg South Patriots had to like their chances at home against the Highlanders in Tuesday night's Class AAAA regional co-final.

After a slow start, Huntington looked like a completely different team than the one the Patriots played last month, but in the end the Patriots prevailed once again with a 63-54 win to punch their ticket to the state tournament next week in Charleston.

The win was also a bit of revenge for the Patriots, who were eliminated from the postseason by none other than the Highlanders a year ago.

“Last year they came in here and beat us on our home floor and that left a bad, bad taste in our mouths,” said Parkersburg South head coach Mike Fallon. “These kids put in all the work and overcame so much adversity and I think the ups and downs we have had have kind of got us ready for this moment.”

South got off to a great start sparked by junior Harry Silvis as they led by as many as 14-points in the opening quarter before the Highlanders came charging back in the second quarter.

Silvis knocked down a couple of early three-pointers and scored 12 points total in the opening quarter to help the Patriots pull out to a 21-8 lead.

The Patriots held their own early in the second period as a three-point play by Silvis gave them a 12-point lead with six minutes to play before the Highlanders of head coach Lambros Svingos began to come to life.

Using a full court press, the Highlanders were able to rattle South as they forced them into seven turnovers in the second quarter alone, many leading to points on the other end.

That pressure defense coupled with the red-hot shooting of sophomore Pierson Dejneka got Huntington right back into it.

Dejneka's third triple of the half pulled them to within five with three minutes to play and three free throws in four attempts by senior Taviun Chandler closed the lead to a field goal.

Silvis was fouled on the next South possession and made one of two free throws only to have Huntington's Isaiah Lapsley answer with a pair of freebies to trim the lead to just one point.

South was in need of a momentum changer and they got just that thanks to Silvis and senior Navi Hewitt.

Hewitt, who had spent a considerable amount of the opening half on the bench due to foul trouble, drove strong to the bucket and finished with a dunk to increase the lead to three.

After the Patriots came up with a huge stop on defense, Silvis beat the buzzer with a step-back three-pointer from well beyond the arc to send South to the intermission with a 34-28 lead.

Huntington continued to provide the pressure in the third period, once again sparked by three more triples by Dejneka as they trailed by just four late in the quarter, but once again the Patriots came up with a huge play in the closing seconds.

This time it was junior Cam Fallon who came up with one of his nine rebounds in the game and then connected on a short jumper as the buzzer sounded to send the Patriots into the final period with a seven-point lead.

Coach Fallon felt those end-of-the-quarter heroics played a huge role in his team's win.

“Those were a couple of huge plays no doubt about it,” said Fallon. “Those end of the quarter buckets just get the momentum going and Harry (Silvis) hit the big three before the half and Cam (Fallon) hit that one at the end of the third quarter and those are big momentum boosters.”

Dejneka connected on his first six three-pointers in the game and seven field goals overall but finally missed on the Highlanders' first possession of the fourth quarter.

South made an impressive 21-of-26 from the charity stripe including many in the final quarter as they led by eight at the midway point.

Hewitt came up with the play that served as the dagger as he came up with a steal near mid-court and finished at the other end with a huge dunk to bring the crowd to its feet and give his team a double-digit lead.

“Once we settled back in I thought our kids did a great job,” said Fallon. “I thought in the fourth quarter our kids did an amazing job and we knew with all the pressing that by the end they would be wore out and I think that really paid dividends.”

Huntington came no closer than seven the rest of the way as the Patriots picked up the win to improve to 15-8 on the season.

Silvis led the way for South with 24 points while Taj Joyce added 15.

Hewitt added nine while Cam Fallon and Mason Nutter picked up nine rebounds apiece.

Huntington was led by Dejneka with 21 points and Taviun Chandler with 12.

The Highlanders' season comes to a close with a 10-13 record while the Patriots will advance to the state tournament next Wednesday when they take on Morgantown at 1 p.m.

“I'm sure Spring Hills is number one and they only beat us by two and Morgantown is number two and we beat them here,” said Fallon. “We feel like we can go in and play with anybody.”

The top stories and transfer rumours from Wednesday's newspapers...

DAILY MAIL

Liverpool are reportedly 'very interested' in signing Borussia Dortmund centre-back Nico Schlotterbeck as a potential successor to Virgil van Dijk.

Sporting Lisbon's in-demand striker Viktor Gyokeres is reportedly interested in joining three Premier League clubs this summer.

Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk was spotted deep in conversation with two PSG chiefs after the Reds were knocked out of the Champions League by the French outfit.

Jean-Philippe Mateta has returned to first-team training for the first time since being on the end of a horror tackle that left him hospitalised and requiring 26 stitches.

There is still a possibility that Jadon Sancho could end up back at Old Trafford this summer if Chelsea decide not to go through with their obligation to buy deal - although it would cost what insiders say is 'a significant penalty' to pull out under the terms of their loan agreement with Manchester United.

GENEVA (AP) — Sign stealing in baseball. Match fixing in soccer. Doping allegations in swimming. Now ski jumping has its own scandal that escalated Wednesday.

Cheating by Norway team officials manipulating ski suits has shaken a national reputation for fair play and high-minded principles at their home Nordic world championships, where the host team dominated the medal table.

Two Olympic gold medalists, Marius Lindvik and Johann André Forfang, had denied involvement since the allegations emerged over the weekend but were suspended Wednesday and put under formal suspicion in an investigation overseen by the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS). They cannot compete in a World Cup event in Oslo that starts Thursday.

Lindvik and Forfang already had been disqualified from the large hill event in Trondheim held Saturday, days after Lindvik soared to become world champion on the normal hill.

Though both athletes were backed by the Norwegian team insisting they knew nothing about deliberately altered ski suits, their head coach Magnus Brevig and equipment manager Adrian Livelten confessed and were stood down from their jobs.

“FIS has provisionally suspended three Norwegian team officials and two athletes who are being investigated for their alleged involvement in illegal equipment manipulation,” the Switzerland-based governing body said in a statement.

An assistant coach, Thomas Lobben, also is part of a probe in which FIS-appointed investigators seized all of the home Norway team's suits used at the worlds.

The scandal has shocked the ski jumping world, raising questions about how widespread this practice is, and tarnished Norway's standing for honesty in sports.

What has emerged involves team officials manipulating pre-approved and microchipped suits to increase their size and improve aerodynamics to help athletes fly further.

It was revealed in footage secretly filmed from behind a curtain then sent by a whistleblower to international media. A FIS official said the illegal alterations were only subsequently confirmed by tearing apart the seams of the crotch area on the offending Norwegian ski suits. 

The scandal has unfolded in Norway which always scores high in Transparency International's anti-corruption index, tied for fifth in the most recent global ranking. 

Norwegian sports officials also led on controversial issues by taking public positions in 2022 in refusing to host Russian athletes days after the full invasion of Ukraine and challenging soccer World Cup host Qatar on human rights.

The same Norwegian ski federation that helped push FIS to exclude Russians three years ago now finds its staff and star athletes under investigation by the governing body.

“The only thing that matters for FIS is to leave this process 100% convinced that the sport is free from any form of manipulation,” its secretary general Michel Vion said in a statement.

Athletes and officials from across the world left Trondheim on Sunday sad and disappointed, FIS race director for men's ski jumping Sandro Pertile told The Associated Press in an interview.

“Norway is a country that we all know as a leader in human rights, in equality, integration. I cannot believe that there is a (cheating) system,” Pertile said in an online call Tuesday, suggesting there was “a few individuals that went really far over the limits.” 

If the infractions seemed obscure and technical to non-fans, the breach of trust was severe: “This action was somehow killing our principles, our style, our joy for our discipline,” Pertile said.

The Norwegian federation acted when FIS officials found evidence that proved what the secret footage alleged, and had led to formal protests from Austria, Slovenia and Poland.

Brevig and Livelten admitted they had cheated, though just on one occasion, ahead of the large hill event held Saturday.

“We regret it like dogs, and I'm terribly sorry that this happened,” Brevig said. “I don't really have anything else to say other than that we got carried away in our bubble.”

Livelten apologized to the disqualified athletes plus “sponsors, the jumping family and the Norwegian people” for an act of cheating he said was “completely unacceptable.”



  How did Norway cheat?
 

“It was an extremely high-level manipulation,” race director Pertile said of the Norwegian actions that were “absolutely by far the worst” in his five years in the job. “We destroyed the suit to be able to find this adjustment.”

The Italian official said alterations were not detected by eye and only were revealed by examining the seams of the crotch area of the ski suits after the competition.

Extra material in the same color had been inserted that added weight and helped to lower the material between an athlete's legs as they took off into the flight phase. More surface area hitting the air helps add to flight time, Pertile said.

FIS previously said a 5% bigger surface area of a suit helps an athlete fly further, though the exact distance added is not known, Pertile said.



  What are the rules?
 

FIS has an 11-page document of rules for measuring and verifying ski jumpers' suits during the season. Multiple RFID chips are attached and noted on a FIS register, after which a suit must not be altered. Any attempt to remove a chip should make the suit ineligible and the chips are deactivated.

One suit is allowed at World Cup events and two more for a world championships or Winter Olympics, though just one is used on each competition day.



  What is the investigation about?
 

FIS investigators now have seized all Norwegian suits used in men's and women's ski jumping and Nordic combined at the world championships.

Lindvik's gold medal in normal hill is sure to be looked at, though it is unclear how far back an investigation could reach for results at World Cup events this season or beyond to previous seasons. Lindvik was Olympic champion in large hill at the 2022 Beijing Winter Games.

The ski jumping World Cup season continues for three more weekends, starting Thursday in Oslo.

Rugby Panther Eli McNeff (32) attempts to shoot the ball, Turtle Mountain Brave defender Wes Davis (53) jumps up to block the shot at the Division A, Region 3 tournament Tuesday, March 11.

The Division A, Region 3 Boys Basketball Tournament had two semifinal games on Tuesday, March 11, at the Minot State University (MSU) Dome with the upper bracket winner the higher seed and the lower bracket winner the underdog.

Des Lacs-Burlington vs. Bottineau

The Des Lacs-Burlington Lakers took on the Bottineau Braves Tuesday, March 11 in the semifinal round of the Region 3A boys basketball tournament. Des Lacs-Burlington, the one seed of the tournament, won 56-40 over Bottineau, the four seed. 

The Lakers' Jace Crocket won the tip off and brought in the first points of the game at the free throw line. The Braves kept the score close with Bud Wilkie scoring almost immediately after the Lakers. Des Lacs-Burlington took the short 12-9 lead at the end of the first quarter. 

The second quarter was all about the Lakers keeping their steady lead. With the help of Colton Feller and Drew Roedocker, Des Lacs-Burlington was able to maintain a four point lead at halftime. 

The Lakers began to build an unstoppable momentum in the final half of the game that eventually led to the 56-40 win. 

Des Lacs-Burlington's shooting efficiency and rebound dominance played a big role in their win. The Lakers collected a total of 33 rebounds compared to Bottineau's 26 rebounds. Crocket picked up a majority of the rebounds, 11, allowing the Lakers to extend their possessions and end the Braves possessions early. 

The Lakers will have to keep up the hard work when they play in the finals against Turtle Mountain, the seven seed of the tournament, who has already upset two teams this week. The winner of the finals match will have its ticket punched to the state tournament. The second place team will play in the state qualifier on March 15 to earn a spot at state

Turtle Mountain vs. Rugby

The Turtle Mountain Braves and the Rugby Panthers both upset higher ranked teams in the quarterfinal round. The two underdogs of the tournament faced off in the semifinals Tuesday, March 11 at the Minot State Dome. 

The seventh seed Braves put on a show and out scored the sixth seed Panthers in every quarter of the game to eventually take the 51-37 decisive win. 

Both teams greatest strengths are their speed and agility, but Turtle Mountain was putting up shots in almost every possession where Rugby could not. The Braves caused turnover after turnover, not even allowing the Panthers to get close to the basket. 

Rugby won the tip off, but quickly lost possession of the ball allowing William Breland to earn the first two points of the game. Turtle Mountain led 21-1 in the first quarter. The Braves were primarily led by Breland with seven points in the first quarter. 

Turtle Mountain dominated throughout the game and had built up a 45-19 lead going into the fourth quarter. In the final quarter of the game the Braves sent in a couple of bench players to finish off the game for the win.

The Braves will compete in the finals against the Des Lacs-Burlington Lakers Thursday, March 13. The winner will also win their spot at the state tournament, the loser will compete in the state qualifier March 15 in a second attempt to make it to state.

Rugby and Bottineau will face off in the third place match Thursday, March 13. The winner of the match will get the chance to play in the state qualifier to earn a spot in the state tournament.

The PGA Tour season is beginning to pick up steam, and with the 2025 Players Championship fast approaching, the key question everyone's asking is the same across the golf world: Who are you picking to win at TPC Sawgrass? With a tremendous field featuring most of the best golfers in the world in attendance, we should be in for an epic ride beginning with Thursday's first round.

While The Players does not hold a ""major championship"" designation, but it's nevertheless a huge event on the annual golf calendar as the PGA Tour's flagship tournament. The $25 million purse and $4.5 million winner's share is more than will be payed out at the Masters, PGA Championship, U.S. Open or Open Championship this year.

Scottie Scheffler, the defending Players champion, enters with plenty of momentum from another dynamite 2024, though his start to the 2025 season has been less than ideal. Collin Morikawa has been playing incredible golf of late, but he fell back Sunday at the Arnold Palmer Invitational to relinquish a lead he held for the better part of two rounds. Tiger Woods will not be in attendance at TPC Sawgrass, though Rory McIlroy will be looking to put his best foot forward with one month to go until he competes for the elusive green jacket at Augusta National Golf Club.

So, what is going to happen this week in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida? Let's take a look at a full set of predictions and picks from our CBS Sports experts. Check out a full slate of Players Championship odds to help set your expectations of the field along with Players Championship tee times and pairings for Round 1 on Thursday.

Patrick McDonald, golf writer 

Winner -- Collin Morikawa (16-1): The Arnold Palmer Invitational loss may still sting, but Morikawa will get right back onto the horse and ride into the winner's circle after traveling a few hours North. The two-time major champion was sensational from tee to green at Bay Hill, and that will carry over to TPC Sawgrass where his blend of accurate driving and pinpoint iron play will allow him to rise to the top of the leaderboard. His Players Championship history is mixed, but he has a number of quality rounds under his belt. Given the way he is trending, he should be able to string four together this week.

Sleeper -- Justin Rose (150-1): The former world No. 1 can still keep up with the big boys on golf courses that require more than just physical skill. One of the best course managers in the game, Rose will rise to the challenge that is TPC Sawgrass like he has many times in the past. The Englishman has two top-10 finishes and two missed cuts since the tournament moved to March drawing parallels to his current season where he has two top 10s (Pebble Beach and Bay Hill) and two missed cuts (both at Torrey Pines).

Top 10 lock -- Scottie Scheffler: What's throwing me off the scent of Scheffler to take home the title is the level of difficulty involved in winning any golf tournament three years in a row, let alone the Players Championship where Scheffler became the first ever to successfully defend with his title last season. The world No. 1 figured out the big stick at Bay Hill where he led the field from off the tee and the rest of his game is now beginning to follow suit. His poor putting at Arnie's Place may introduce some questions, but his tee-to-green game is good enough to finish inside the top 10 without the aid of a cooperative flat stick.

Star who definitely won't win -- Justin Thomas: There have not been many to win The Players twice, and Thomas isn't going to add his name to that list (at least not this year). While the tee-to-green presence is strong, there are still some holes in his game -- big misses off the tee, big numbers on the scorecard and short misses on the greens -- especially when the test ramps up. Since his 2022 PGA Championship victory, Thomas has one top 10 (2024 PGA), six missed cuts and no other finishes inside the top 30 in the majors or The Players.

Surprise prediction -- Jordan Spieth contends: His Players form stinks, but something is clicking at the moment. Spieth continues to drive the ball effectively, and while his iron play can come and go, he is making putts again -- something he was not doing from 2022-24. A top-10 finish at the WM Phoenix Open was not all too surprising given his history at TPC Scottsdale, but another such result at PGA National in his debut appearance was more than welcomed. 

Lowest round: 64 (-8)Winning score: 268 (-20)Winner's Sunday score: 68 (-4)

Josh Mullenix, Early Wedge producer

Winner -- Scottie Scheffler (5-1): His start to 2025 has been a little turbulent by his standards, but he still has three top 11 finishes in four starts. He's going to make someone else stare him down and win the tournament, something only Stephan Jaeger has done the last two years. TPC Sawgrass will make the winner hit three to five well executed golf shots on Sunday down the stretch, and no one executes better than the World No. 1.

Sleeper -- Daniel Berger (55-1): He's done nothing but bank top 25 finishes since the RSM Classic in November. After a missed cut at the Farmers Insurance Open where the putter let him down, he's gaining across the bag and just finished T15 at the Arnold Palmer Invitational despite opening with a 78 on Thursday. It's his first Players Championship in three years, but he finished among the top 15 in both 2021 and 2022. One thing is for sure about Berger: He has the confidence to win this week and his game suggests the same. 

Top 10 lock -- Collin Moriakwa: There's a clear closing problem with Morikawa -- look no further than Bay Hill last Sunday. But that's basically his only problem at this juncture. He leads the PGA Tour this season in strokes gained tee to green and is a measly sixth in approach. As one of the best iron players in the world with the driving accuracy to hit from the fairway all week long, it's hard to see him not banking a quality finish. I just highly doubt he'll figure out how to win again with the pressure of TPC Sawgrass' closing stretch staring him in the face.  

Star who definitely won't win -- Patrick Cantlay: The golf world is perpetually underwhelmed by Cantlay even though last week's T31 was just his second finish outside of the top 25 since last year's Memorial Tournament. However, he also finished outside the top 30 at Pebble Beach. He's battling a different thing every week; lost strokes with the putter and off the tee at the Arnold Palmer, the short game was bad at the Genesis and the putter disappeared at Pebble Beach. Before that he started the year with some shaky iron play. More than anything, Cantlay isn't going to win this week because Cantlay doesn't win anywhere. We are now 933 days removed from his last victory at the 2022 BMW Championship.

Surprise prediction -- Two of the six betting favorites will miss the cut: The volatility of success at The Players is one of the reasons this tournament is so fun. Every year, past champions and big names find the water one too many times and miss the cut. Two of Scheffler, Morikawa, Thomas, Rory McIlroy, Ludvig Åberg and Tommy Fleetwood will not even play the weekend. Maybe McIlroy brings a wayward driver like he did last year. Thomas's putter is nonexistent. Åberg's short game and approach is a little sloppy. TPC Sawgrass is primed to turn little imperfections into a weekend off, even for the best in the field.

Lowest round: 64 (-8)Winning score: 272 (-16)Winner's Sunday score: 70 (-2)

Adam Silverstein, senior director of editorial

Winner -- Collin Morikawa (16-1): Scheffler is the deserving favorite at TPC Sawgrass given his dominance of the course, but Morikawa is the value play coming off his second-place finish (that should have been a win) at the Arnold Palmer Invitational last week. His precision and accuracy will do him well in Ponte Vedra Beach, and simply put, he's a trustworthy start who is unlikely to go wayward like so many others might. Scheffler winning three straight is certainly possible given his immense skill, but he still needs to put it all together in 2025.

Sleeper -- Shane Lowry (35-1): Granted, I might stretching the definition of ""sleeper"" here, but Lowry is basically a top-10 lock at TPC Sawgrass. At some point, he's going to break through to hoist the trophy and $4.5 million check. He's finished among the top 11 in each of his last two starts and seems to be continuing to surge off a successful 2024. I'd rather back him at these odds than someone twice as long who is far less likely to win.

Top 10 lock -- Scottie Scheffler: Whether Morikawa struggles to close or he puts his game together at the right time, it's hard to imagine Scheffler not being among the top five once 72 holes are played at TPC Sawgrass. Being given twice as many spots in which to back a guy who has already defended his title at The Players feels generous, but I'll take it.

Star who definitely won't win -- Xander Schauffele: The game is just not there, and at 18-1, it would be foolhardy to back him (though that is twice as much value as he'll get at majors later this year). Schauffele finished T30 at The Sentry and T40 last week after barely making the Bay Hill cut on the number. Going from that to the winner's circle coming out of this strong of a field is highly unlikely.

Surprise prediction -- Rickie Fowler contends on Sunday: There is nothing from his season thus far that points to Fowler making a run at TPC Sawgrass, though he does have two finishes near the top 10 this year, and obviously he's won at this course before. He's at 90-1 on the oddsboard and coming off a week where he did not play after not receiving an expected exemption into the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Talk about motivation.

Lowest round: 64 (-8)Winning score: 274 (-14)Winner's Sunday score: 69 (-3)

Oops, something went wrong

We recently published a list of 10 Tech News Updates Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) stands against other tech news updates investors should not miss.

On March 6th, CoreWeave, an Nvidia-backed cloud-computing startup, denied claims in a Financial Times report that Microsoft had pulled the plug in some of the agreements it had signed with the cloud provider due to service delivery challenges and missed deadlines.

“We pride ourselves in our client partnerships and there have been no contract cancellations or walking away from commitments. Any claim to the contrary is false and misleading,” a CoreWeave spokesperson told Reuters in an emailed statement.

The news follows after Stack Capital Group made an investment of $10 million in the AI-infrastructure company, according to a company release on March 5th.

“Given its growing data center presence across the United States, Europe, and Canada, CoreWeave is extremely well-positioned to continue capitalizing on accelerating global demand for AI infrastructure and compute capabilities,” said Jeff Parks, CEO of Stack Capital.

According to a Reuters report on March 7th, the Azure parent has begun testing out models from xAI, Meta and DeepSeek to develop AI models to compete with OpenAI.

For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds, as of Q4 2024.

At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

A team of IT professionals meticulously crafting a large-scale enterprise performance management system.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 105

Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is a computer technology company that offers a comprehensive and fully integrated stack of cloud applications and cloud platform services. On March 7th, TD Cowen maintained a buy rating on the company, with a steady price target of $210.00 backed by the firm's expectations of its new Stargate partnership which aims to invest around $500 billion over four years in AI infrastructure across the US. Oracle, along with OpenAI and Softbank, have identified locations in Texas for new data centers, while the company has also partnered with Google to enhance the Oracle Database@Google Cloud's capabilities.

Overall, ORCL ranks 2nd on our list of tech news updates investors should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of ORCL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ORCL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Samsung will lead 6G standardisation efforts within the 3GPP, the world's largest telecoms standards development organisation.

At the recent 3GPP plenary meeting, Dr Younsun Kim from Samsung Research was elected as Chair of the 3GPP Technical Specification Group Radio Access Network (TSG RAN). This group is responsible for standardising all facets of wireless technology, including the physical layer, protocol aspects, and radio resource control.

Dr Kim's appointment is seen as a significant win for Samsung, allowing the company to heavily influence the future direction of 6G technology.

“I believe that my election as chair is further recognition of Samsung's leadership in mobile communication technology,” stated Dr Kim. “6G standardisation involves more than just solving technical issues; it is a collaborative effort requiring participation from all companies and organisations in the mobile communication sector.”

3GPP, established in 1998, is instrumental in shaping global mobile communication standards and has active participation from industry giants such as Samsung, Apple, Qualcomm, Huawei, Ericsson, and Nokia.

Dr Kim's track record within 3GPP is already impressive. In May 2021, he was elected Chair of Radio Access Network Working Group 1 (RAN WG1), the largest working group within 3GPP, responsible for developing physical layer specifications for 3GPP radio access technologies. Over the past four years, Dr Kim has successfully spearheaded the standardisation of 5G physical layer technology, playing a key role in the burgeoning 5G network industry.

With his expanded role as Chair of 3GPP TSG RAN, effective from May, Samsung will be able to exert even greater influence over the standardisation of 6G, the next evolutionary step in mobile communication technology.

“Dr Kim's appointment to the chair position of the Technical Specification Group is viewed as a recognition of Samsung's contributions and technological leadership in the mobile communication industry,” the company stated.

Samsung currently holds two chair positions, in RAN WG1 and SA WG2, and four vice-chair positions in RAN WG2, SA WG4, SA WG6, and CT WG3. With Dr Kim's election, Samsung will maintain the highest number of chair positions within 3GPP – even after the RAN WG1 chair term expires – solidifying its pivotal role among over 800 member companies.

“The advancement of mobile communication systems is now at a turning point. It must not only enhance transmission speeds but also drive 6G standardisation with a focus on new values,” according to Samsung.

6G aims to deliver “future-oriented and sustainable advancements” in mobile communication, including improved network energy efficiency, enhanced network quality using AI, and robust security technologies to counter quantum computer-based attacks.

“I will make every effort to successfully lead 3GPP's TSG RAN and advance the standardisation of 6G,” Dr Kim concludes.

Oliver Darcy writes in his Status newsletter about how The Wall Street Journal laid off the bulk of its tech news staff last week.

Darcy writes, “Last Tuesday morning, a murmur began to ripple through The Wall Street Journal's San Francisco bureau: Senior management was conspicuously in the building. Marie Beaudette, a top editor overseeing business, finance, and economic coverage, had flown in from the east coast with deputy editor-in-chief Charles Forelle. Their unannounced arrival set off a growing buzz among staffers, fueling suspicion that something was about to happen.

“As it turned out, the staffers were right. Something big, indeed, was about to happen. Soon after they trickled into the building, staffers got word that Jason Dean, a well-liked technology editor who had been at the financial broadsheet for nearly a quarter of a century, had been let go. The devastated staffers made their way to Dean in the office, where they offered tearful farewells.

“But as they said their goodbyes, the situation turned from bad to worse for the Bay Area-based staffers.”

Indian stock market: Kaynes Technology India, a leading player in end-to-end IoT solutions and integrated electronics manufacturing, saw its shares plunge 9.15% in early morning trade on March 12, to hit a 2-week low of  ₹3,898 apiece after the company, in an exchange filing on Tuesday, disclosed that its Managing Director, Mr. Ramesh Kunhikannan, has received a show-cause notice from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).

'The Notice alleges suspected violations in the maintenance of the Structured Digital Database (SDD) pertaining to financial results for the period ended March 31, 2023, as per the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015,"" the company said in a regulatory filing.

""We are currently reviewing the contents of the Notice and will take all appropriate legal and procedural steps, including providing a timely response to SEBI. The company, the Noticee, and all concerned remain committed to fully cooperating with SEBI to resolve this matter in accordance with the applicable legal and regulatory framework,"" the company added.

The company shares have been falling recently, especially after the electronics equipment maker trims its FY25 revenue forecast. Although the company reported a 47% YoY jump in its consolidated net profit, it came lower than the street estimates, prompting analysts to cut the target price on the stock.

Global brokerage firm Jefferies upgrades Kaynes Technology India from 'Hold' to 'Buy' while lowering the price target to  ₹5,400 from  ₹6,950. Meanwhile, Japanese brokerage firm Nomura revises the price target for Kaynes Technology India to  ₹6,146 from  ₹6,516, maintaining its 'Buy' rating

Over the last three months (including the current month), the shares have tumbled 44.5%, ending February with a 13.53% decline, followed by January's 35.99% drop, which was the biggest monthly decline since its listing in December 2022.

However, in the long term, the stock is still up 328% over the last two years and 600% over the past three years.

World's First Modular Quantum Computer Operates at Room Temperature

Photo Credit: Xanadu/YouTube

A quantum computer capable of functioning at room temperature has been developed, marking a major advancement in the field. Named Aurora, the system operates using light-based qubits and connects multiple modules through fibre optic cables. This approach aims to address key challenges in quantum computing, including scalability, fault tolerance, and error correction. The technology, designed by Xanadu, a Toronto-based quantum computing company, demonstrates the potential for networked quantum computers that do not require extreme cooling measures.

According to a study published in Nature, Aurora is the first quantum system that operates at scale while being entirely photonic. Traditional quantum computers rely on superconducting qubits that require near-absolute zero temperatures to function effectively. These systems face significant challenges due to heat generation and complex cooling infrastructure. By utilising photonic qubits instead of superconducting ones, Xanadu's researchers have created a system that integrates seamlessly into existing fibre optic networks.

As reported, Christian Weedbrook, CEO and founder of Xanadu, explained that the industry's primary challenges lie in improving quantum error correction and achieving scalability. The system has been designed with smaller, interconnected modules rather than a single large unit. Speaking to the publication, Darran Milne, CEO of VividQ and an expert in quantum information theory, noted that while dividing a quantum system into multiple components may improve error correction, it has been seen whether this approach will ultimately reduce errors or compound them.

The system integrates 35 photonic chips linked by 13 kilometres of fibre optic cables. Researchers believe this framework could enable large-scale quantum data centres, facilitating applications such as drug discovery simulations and secure quantum cryptography. According to Xanadu, future efforts will focus on minimising optical signal loss in fibre connections to enhance performance.

    Industrial and Commercial Bank of China 601398, the world's biggest commercial lender by assets, announced on Wednesday the launch of an 80 billion yuan ($11.04 billion) technology and innovation fund to support the private economy.

The new fund aims to support ""hard technology"" via equity investment, referring to areas such as semiconductors and advanced manufacturing over ""soft"" technology such as internet services, according to a statement released by the state-owned bank.

ICBC will thoroughly implement directives from central leadership by transforming beneficial policies into concrete actions supporting private enterprises, Liao Lin, chairman of the lender, said at a meeting on Wednesday, according to the statement.

    The fund is also positioned as ""patient capital"" over the rush for quick profit, it said.  

    The move comes after China last week laid out its major policy priorities for 2025 at     an annual parliamentary meeting    , including how it plans to spur consumption and achieve technological breakthroughs amid geopolitical tensions between China and the U.S.  

    Last week, China's state planner said the nation will set up a government-backed fund that would mobilize 1 trillion yuan from social capital to support technology startups.

The logistics arm of e-commerce giant JD.com reported its 2024 revenue grew nearly 10%, as external customers contributed 70% of the total

By Teri Yu

JD Logistics Inc. (2618.HK) reported 9.7% revenue growth and a record profit last year, as it diversified its customer base beyond its parent, e-commerce giant JD.com, and boosted its margins through steady technology upgrades and other efficiencies.

The company reported revenue of 182.8 billion yuan ($25.6 billion) for 2024, with external customers supplying 127.8 billion yuan, or about 70% of its total, according to its results released on last Friday. It recorded a non-IFRS annual profit of 7.92 billion yuan, nearly triple the 2.76 billion yuan a year earlier, on greater efficiencies as it upgraded its technology-driven integrated supply chain (ISC) solutions. Its non-IFRS margin rose from 1.7% in 2023 to 4.3% last year. Both the profit and margin were the company's highest since its listing in 2021.

On a quarterly basis, JD Logistics' fourth quarter revenue rose 10.4% year-on-year to 52.1 billion yuan, while its non-IFRS profit rose 23.4% to 2.2 billion yuan, improving for an eighth consecutive quarter.

“Over the past year, we have further consolidated our differentiated competitive advantages centered on ISC solutions and high-quality logistics services by continuously optimizing warehouse network deployment, advancing technological innovations, and enhancing operational efficiency,” said CEO Hu Wei on the company's earnings call.

JD Logistics said it has used its industry-specific ISC management services to help its corporate customers across a range of industries, including home appliances, furniture and apparel, to reduce costs and enhance their efficiency by optimizing inventory management, streamlining resource allocation and reducing operating costs.

Revenue from ISC customers last year reached 87.4 billion yuan. Its external ISC customer base totaled 80,703 up 8% from a year earlier.

In 2024, the company said it fully upgraded its digital supply chain technology ecosystem with its “JD Logistics Super Brain”, which integrates technologies including AI, big data, and operations research into diverse logistics processes.

At the end of last year, JD Logistics operated a network of over 100 warehouses for its international business with an aggregate gross floor area of over 1 million square meters. Its overseas warehouse network now covers 19 countries and regions.

In its global business, JD Logistics said last year it was supporting a leading Chinese new energy vehicle (NEV) brand with its China-Europe trunk line services. It also said it was supporting another automotive brand with its full cross-border services, including customs clearance, warehousing and distribution in the Middle East.

The company continued to build up its network infrastructure last year to expand its freight delivery and international express delivery services to grab a bigger share of the global e-commerce market. As part of its global build-out, it recently announced that it opened its third warehouse in Poland on Tuesday this week.

JD Logistics was the second unit of JD.com for a separate listing in 2021, raising HK$24.1 billion ($3.1 billion). It was originally set up as JD.com's in-house logistics department in 2007 and has grown since then to become one of the largest players in China's ISC logistics services industry.

With millions of songs across various genres, Spotify is one of the most popular music streaming platforms in the world. However, Spotify is yet to roll out lossless streaming. Its biggest competitor, Apple Music, has had it since its inception in 2021.

However, with the right settings and optimisations, you can still get an excellent audio experience on Spotify. Here's what you need to do:

Compared to Apple Music, Spotify currently prioritises efficiency. This means streaming music on Spotify will consume less data compared to Apple Music. Many users may not notice any difference at all unless they use high-end headphones or speakers.

However, with some simple fine-tuning, you can enhance your Spotify experience significantly.

Go to Settings &gt; Audio Quality and select “Very High”. This enables streaming at 320kbps, which is the highest quality Spotify currently offers. However, this option is only available for Premium Spotify users.

Similarly, enable the “Download in Very High-Quality” option. This will not only improve music quality but will also help you save data, especially if you are someone who listens to select songs repeatedly.

Lastly, turn off the “Data Saver” Mode (Settings > Data Saver), as it reduces audio quality to conserve bandwidth.

These three changes can significantly improve your Spotify user experience. Needless to say that you need to have a high-speed, uninterrupted internet connection as patchy networks can impact your music-streaming experience.

Spotify offers playback settings that can enhance your listening experience. This includes the Crossfade (Settings > Playback > Crossfade) option, which enables a smooth transition between songs.

You can also turn on the Gapless Playback option. This, at least for some users, will deliver a seamless switching experience between songs. You can also enable the Normalise Volume option that eliminates sudden spikes to ensure the entire song plays at the same tempo. However, according to some, this feature makes the music sound flatter.

No matter how optimised your settings are, your output device plays a significant role in audio quality. This simply means you need better earphones, headphones, or speakers to get the best possible music-streaming experience on Spotify.

Invest in wired headphones or buy wireless earphones or headphones with high-quality Bluetooth codec support, such as aptX, LDAC, or AAC.

To further enhance your experience, you can also invest in an in-ear monitor (IEM) and pair it with an external Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC), especially if you're serious about audio fidelity and plan on listening to music the way artists wish you would.

Until Spotify HiFi is released, these optimisations ensure you get the best possible audio output. Spotify's high-bitrate format, coupled with proper settings and high-quality audio gear, can still provide an impressive listening experience.

This No Is Already Registered.

News regarding Apple's foldable iPhone has been circulating for quite some time. Recently, it was reported that the company might launch the Foldable iPhone in the market by next year. Just as discussions about this device were heating up, new rumors emerged about a foldable iPad as well. According to leaked information, Apple is currently developing a foldable iPad featuring an 18.8-inch display.

If these leaks are accurate, Apple is working on a Foldable iPad Pro, and a prototype has already surfaced. This prototype suggests that the device could come equipped with an Under Display Face ID feature. Notably, this would mark the first instance of such technology in a device, as only Samsung currently has under-display Face ID capabilities. If the rumors hold true, this development could pose serious challenges for Samsung in the foldable smartphone market moving forward.

While Apple has yet to officially announce anything about the Foldable iPad, the leaks indicate that the company might aim for a launch by the end of 2027. Furthermore, prior information from the Wall Street Journal hinted that Apple is also developing a foldable device designed to function as a compact laptop; when opened, this device would boast a display size of around 19 inches.

In other news, Apple is gearing up to unveil its slimmest iPhone yet this year, potentially called the iPhone 17 Air. Recent reports have shed light on various details surrounding this groundbreaking smartphone, including its expected launch date and features. If the rumors are accurate, the iPhone 17 Air could emerge as the thinnest smartphone globally, showcasing a design that prioritizes a lightweight construction. 

Notably, it's anticipated to incorporate a silicon carbon battery, setting it apart from its predecessors. The iPhone 17 Air is anticipated to launch sometime in September this year, potentially during an event scheduled between September 9 and 11.

The Financial Express



Bharti Airtel and Jio Platforms, the two telecom and digital services providers, who have entered into an agreement with SpaceX to market Starlink's satellite Internet services in the country, will be focusing on enterprise customers rather than retail.

The same has been made amply clear in the statements issued by both the companies. “The agreement with SpaceX is part of Jio's commitment to ensuring that reliable Internet is fully accessible to all enterprises, small and medium businesses, and communities across India,” Jio Platforms said in its statement on Wednesday.

Similarly, Bharti Airtel, which announced its pact on Tuesday, said, “Airtel and SpaceX will explore offering Starlink equipment in Airtel's retail stores, Starlink services via Airtel to business customers, opportunities to connect communities, schools, and health centres, among many others, in even the most rural parts of India”.

The focus on enterprises by both the firm, rather than retail customers, clearly brings out the fact that the pricing of satellite broadband services is much higher than terrestrial mobile networks and the two are not same in nature and will not compete. Rather the two are complementary in nature.

“The initial growth will have to come from enterprise solutions. Sectors like defence, hospitality and mining have ready use cases for satellite Internet,” Pareekh Jain, chief executive of EIIRTrend, a tech focussed information platform said.

Essentially, enterprises operating in terrains where terrestrial fibre access is not available will provide the catchment of enterprise customers for service providers.

While defence has pretty obvious use cases given the presence of the navy at high seas, or the army in areas with dense forest cover or in hilly areas, hotels and resorts in such areas also will be potential customers for enterprise satellite Internet.

Enterprise customers will also not be as price sensitive as non-business consumers, experts said since there are use cases which will help solve problems of connectivity which terrestrial telecom networks have not been able to do so far.

Things will be different on the consumer front however. The lack of a use case in areas where terrestrial networks are able to cater to data needs will mean that players will need to focus on areas where fiber penetration is low or absent.

“The need for satellite Internet is in areas that are fairly far flung which also do not show a propensity to spend on something like Internet. So, charging a premium may not be possible. At the same time, the cost of satellite receivers and other hardware components is not coming down any time soon,” a telecom executive said.

Starlink's services are available starting at $75 per month in the US (approximately Rs 6,500 a month) which is at a huge premium to the average revenue per user (Arpu) for home broadband services in India at Rs 400-600 across service providers. Jain observed that while Starlink does have differential pricing depending on the local dynamics of each market, it remains to be seen just how much of a discount to its US pricing it can afford to offer for its satellite Internet services in India.

“Whether it is Starlink or any other player, B2C pricing will need to be aided by government subsidies. Otherwise it will be very difficult to have a sustainable business model,” another telecom executive said.

There is a silver lining though in this case, experts added. Since spectrum is a shared resource when it comes to satcom, there is little to no chance of a tariff war breaking out, experts said.

Pricing will also be determined by the availability of hardware components domestically, and the cost of sourcing them if they need to be imported. For example, Starlink has a proprietary design for the antennae required for installing satellite internet services on a premises. Other players in the Indian market may need to either develop their own design, or procure the same from Starlink.

Actor Scarlett Johansson, in a new interview, has opened up about that raunchy Saturday Night Live moment when her husband, Colin Jost, made a joke on her vagina. She said that it left her shocked. (Also read: Jurassic World Rebirth trailer: Scarlett Johansson anchors a new era of survival with jaw-dropping new dinosaurs. Watch)

During the interaction with In Style, Scarlett recalled the joke and said, ""It was so vulgar, I just can't believe that they went there. I was like—it was so gross. It was really gross. And, like, old-school gross.”

She went on to add, “My experience of it was so funny. I was like, I mean, it's a vagina joke, how bad could it be? And then as soon as the Costco photo came up, I was like No! No, Michael! The fact that it took on a full To Catch a Predator-style reveal or whatever, that was so intense. All of a sudden, it was like a whole bunch of people holding up lights, and a guy with a video camera. They were waiting for me to react. I felt insane. I was like, I think I'm going to faint.”

During the live episode, where Michael Che and Colin Jost's jokes were swapped during the Weekend update, Colin said, “Costco has removed the roast beef sandwich from their menu. But I ain't tripping. I've been eating roast beef every night since my wife had the kid.” Scarlett, who stood backstage, was seen shocked at the joke. She mouthed “Oh my God” in the live reaction.

Scarlett Johansson and Colin Jost married in 2020 in an intimate ceremony with family and friends after dating for three years. They welcomed their first child together, a boy whom they named Cosmo, in 2021.

The Kelly Clarkson Show hasn't been the same since Kelly Clarkson has been gone, and fans are worried.

The 42-year-old singer's absence began on Monday, March 3, when she unexpectedly had Simu Lu host the episode. The Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings star was supposed to be a guest but ended up stepping in at the last minute.

""Kelly isn't able to make it today. We're sending her our very best. I did not know that I was doing this until about five minutes ago when I arrived to promote my new movie Last Breath,"" Lu told the audience. ""I'm here now, and look, I'm not one to back down from a challenge.""

However, the ""Because of You"" hitmaker returned to host the show on Tuesday, March 4, and Wednesday, March 5; since then, the show has seen a revolving door of celebrity guest hosts.

The Kelly Clarkson Show posted the lineup of guest hosts on Instagram earlier this week, and eager fans commented on how they missed the American Idol alum and are ""concerned"" about her.

""I respect Kelly Clarkson's privacy, but I am very concerned about her,"" one fan penned.

""We don't need to know her business but need to know she is ok please 😢,"" a second person commented.

Someone else wrote, ""Please let us know if Kelly is OK.""

A post shared by The Kelly Clarkson Show (@kellyclarksonshow)

Comedian Roy Wood Jr. hosted the Thursday, March 6 show, while singer Josh Groban and comedian Wanda Sykes came in at the end of the week and co-hosted the Friday, March 7 episode. Like Clarkson often does, Groban delighted fans by performing for them. He opted to sing ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"" from The Wizard of Oz.

This week, actress Brooke Shields showed off her interview skills by hosting the Monday and Tuesday episodes.

A post shared by The Kelly Clarkson Show (@kellyclarksonshow)

Morning Joe anchor Willie Geist stepped in to host the Wednesday show, telling viewers, ""Welcome to the 'Kelly Clarkson Show' I am very much not Kelly Clarkson, and I am sorry for that.""

On Thursday, March 13, and Friday 14, Molly Sims will take on the task of hosting.

No word on when the pop star will be back at her job or why she has been missing.

Tori Spelling hates water. 

The Beverly Hills, 90210 alum opened up about her aversion to liquid on the latest episode of iHeartRadio podcast misSpelling, revealing that she's confused about how she's ""able to live her life in a state of dehydration.""

The reality star's water-repellent ways also contribute to her fear of other liquids, as she believes that every open drink handed to her is poisoned, even if it's made by someone in her circle. Spelling traces this very real fear back to her childhood. The star's mother once crushed a baby aspirin and gave it to her in a spoonful of Coca-Cola, and that's what started it all. 

""So this goes back to childhood. This is crazy. This irrational fear of handed-over liquids from other people. But it ties into my fear of water because I don't drink water. I don't call it a fear of water. I just call it — I like to say, you know, I hate water.""

Spelling has been to the hospital a few times because of dehydration caused by her repulsion of water.

Millie Bobby Brown's new blonde hair caused a stir online, and now she's switching it up yet again — for a brief bit with Jimmy Fallon.

While on the Tuesday, March 11 episode of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, the 21-year-old Stranger Things star sat down for an interview — during which she discussed her marriage to Jon Bon Jovi's son, Jake Bongiovi — and also participated in the ""Slay It, Don't Spray It"" segment with Fallon, during which the actors competed against each other to see who could remember the most '90s lyrics in a karaoke-style competition.

Because the game involved getting hosed in the face — if The Electric State star couldn't finish the lyrics, she'd be sprayed in the face by water; if Fallon couldn't, he would be — both stars had to wear black, thick-rimmed ""safety glasses.""

""Safety is sexy,"" the 50-year-old late-night host noted, putting on the rectangular frames himself. As the camera panned to Brown, also clad in the glasses, the audience let out a few whoops and cheers.

Though the thick frames — which looked more like regular glasses than safety googles — were only for the game, they completely transformed Brown's look, giving her glamorous ensemble an academic-like edge.

Over the past week, Brown has been candid about how critics have reacted to her new look — particularly those who say ""she looks 40.""

On a new episode of Alex Cooper's Call Her Daddy podcast, the British star got real about the harsh criticism.

""You did meet me when I was 10,"" she said, referring to her starring role on Stranger Things. ""My face like, grew. What do you want me to do about that?"" she asked. ""I'm in a place where, yeah, my accent does change [from British to American]. My face does grow. I do wear a lot of makeup. It's just the kind of person I am.""

Brown — who referred to the criticism as ""standards and stigmas against girls"" — urged the media to ""learn how to speak to people, be kind and just understand that we're all growing people, we all make mistakes.""

Demi Lovato, 32, shared a new video on TikTok and it has some fans concerned for her health.

On Tuesday, March 11, the ""Confident"" singer uploaded a TikTok in which she cooked a whole chicken.

""On Cooking With Demi we are all about facing our fears. Today we did that by trying out a recipe for a whole roasted chicken. It wasn't pretty at times, but it wasn't nearly as overwhelming as I thought it would be and I'm really proud to have this recipe in my back pocket now,"" Lovato captioned the video.

As she was preparing the meal, however, some viewers noticed that Lovato's hands were shaking quite a bit.

""I'm afraid of seeing her shaking that hard,"" a fan wrote in the comments section of the post.

""I'm okay! I promise,"" Lovato responded, adding a black heart emoji. Lovato didn't elaborate on why she appeared to be shaking, however.

Over the years, Lovato has suffered with eating disorders and depression, as well as substance abuse. In 2018, she nearly died following a drug overdose. The terrifying incident caused her to have three strokes and a heart attack.

On ✨Cooking With Demi✨ we are all about facing our fears. Today we did that by trying out a recipe for a whole roasted chicken. It wasn't pretty at times, but it wasn't nearly as overwhelming as I thought it would be and I'm really proud to have this recipe in my back pocket now 🖤 INGREDIENTS:  1 3 3/4 to 4 pound chicken 1 lemon Kosher salt 1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme, plus 10 sprigs 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 or 3 carrots, peeled and cut in chunks 1 medium yukon gold potato, cut in chunks 3 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled ½ small onion 1 stalk celery 5 or 6 ¾-inch slices of a baguette 2 big handfuls of baby arugula 1 tablespoon vinegar

In an interview on Andy Cohen Live! in 2023, Lovato said that the overdose left her with a disability.

""I have vision impairment and hearing impairment....That's the closest thing that I have to a regret is that because of what it's caused me today. Like, I don't drive because I have blind spots in my vision,"" she told Cohen, according to E! News.

""It's a daily constant reminder. Anytime I look at something—I have blind spots in my vision when I look at your face. And so, it's a constant reminder to stay on the right path because I never want that to happen again,"" she explained.

On Tuesday, March 11, Rolling Stone published an interview with the 22-year-old pop-rock star, who revealed he was not well acquainted with the 14-time Grammy Award winner before he was asked to be an opening act on the Eras Tour. In June 2024, Boone opened for Swift at London's Wembley Stadium.

""I didn't even know much about her. Her team reached out, and I literally, like, s**t my pants. I could not believe it,"" he recalled. ""It was insane, so I started listening to more of her music. I didn't want to go to that show and not know anything.""

Boone praised the pop star for her kindness towards him and those around her, noting the experience of meeting her was transformative.

""She is an unbelievable performer and has an unbe­lievable world built around her that is unmatched. She is one of a kind. Such a genuine person. I got the privilege to talk to her, for a while, and she's so kind,"" he remarked. ""And she shouted me out onstage, which you do not need to do. It really changed my perspective on so many things that I want to carry into my own career. Just the way I treat people and my crew, watching the way that she treats people.""

Boone added that he thinks the haters who don't really know her should give her a chance.

""There's a lot of people who don't like Taylor Swift,"" he told the outlet. ""Everybody is entitled to their own opinion, But if you have something against her and you don't know her, I don't think that is fair.""

The Eras Tour — which lasted from March 2023 to December 2024 — became the highest-grossing tour of all time. Other opening acts on the record-breaking tour included Sabrina Carpenter, Gracie Abrams, Paramore, and Haim.

The wait is over.

Paramount+ has announced the series Landman has been renewed for a second season, Variety reported on Wednesday, March 12.

The show, set in the oil fields of West Texas, aired its Season 1 finale in January. Billy Bob Thornton stars in the drama as Tommy Norris, a landman — or professional working in the oil, gas and minerals industries — who he has described as someone ""just worn out every minute of the day.""

""I mean, you know, [he's] driving 3- or 400 miles a day in two different oil fields, and then he's got this eccentric family who's kind of come in to add some extra flavor to his life,"" Thornton, 69, told Texas Standard in a December 2024 interview. ""So, you know, a landman's busy enough already, and then you throw them on top of it.""

""And it's quite a life,"" the actor continued. ""These are guys that... You know, he's got a dark sense of humor about it, but he lives in a pretty dangerous and gambling world. And I think he's a guy who's just driven to keep things together and make it a success.""

Landman, which also stars Demi Moore, Ali Larter, and Jon Hamm, is a huge hit for Paramount+, according to the network's president and CEO, Chris McCarthy.

""Landman was one of the biggest shows of the year because of [writer and director] Taylor Sheridan's unique ability to tap into the cultural zeitgeist, harnessing the Neo-western themes of rugged individualism, ambition and working-class struggles set against contemporary debates around energy, climate change and economic growth,"" McCarthy said.

He added: ""The series has helped drive Paramount+ to new heights as the #2 SVOD [subscription video on demand] in the US for Original Hours Watched in Q4, alongside our other hit series Tulsa King, The Agency, Lioness and Dexter: Original Sin.""

Joe Rogan has faced some tough competition in the podcast world.

The comedian began hosting The Joe Rogan Experience podcast in 2009, and he has had a wide array of guests on the show, from political figures like Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders to actors like Jamie Foxx and entrepreneurs like billionaire Elon Musk.

The podcast was on Apple until 2020 when it became a Spotify exclusive show. However, in 2024, the deal with Spotify ended, putting it back on the Apple charts. The show has become a top charting podcast, often sitting at the #1 spot, but it has been dethroned a few times on different charts.

Read about the top podcasts that have taken the #1 spot from Rogan.

Newsweek reported in February 2025 that The MeidasTouch podcast took the No. 1 spot away from Rogan, according to Podscribe data.

The political podcast is hosted by three brothers, Ben, Brett, and Jordy Meiselas.

A post shared by MeidasTouch (@meidastouch)

Per their podcast description, the show ""combines brotherly love, comedy, news coverage, and deep discussions about supporting our democracy and is the go-to destination for top political leaders who view the podcast as a pivotal stop for their interviews.""

In December 2024, Kylie Kelce, the wife of retired Philadelphia Eagles player Jason Kelce, launched her podcast, Not Gonna Lie with Kylie Kelce. The show quickly rose to the No. 1 spot that month.

A post shared by Not Gonna Lie with Kylie Kelce (@nglwithkylie)

Kylie speaks on a variety of topics in the entertainment/pop culture space, as well as sports and family life in her episodes.

Kylie spoke to New York Times in December 2024 and stated, ""I couldn't care less about the charts."" She admitted that the haters who were mad about her clinching the top spot are part of what drives her.

Meghan Markle's Archetypes podcast premiered in 2022 as a Spotify exclusive, and it debuted at No. 1 on the charts, knocking down Rogan.

According to the Spotify description, the show is ""a podcast where we investigate, dissect, and subvert the labels that try to hold women back.""

Despite its success, only 12 episodes were released.

Tori Spelling doesn't drink water.

The former Beverly Hills 90210 star, 51, has confessed she has an ""aversion"" to the drink and does everything she can to avoid it — revealing she opts for coconut water or soda instead and joking she's like a ""cacti"".

During an appearance on her MisSPELLING podcast, she explained: ""I don't drink water. And when I say I don't drink water, I don't drink water.

""How I'm still living, no one knows. I'm like a cacti. Just water me once in a while, and I somehow survive. But I have an aversion to it.""

She added: ""I'm trying this new thing since I don't like water. I'm like, okay, I actually enjoy the taste of coconut water.

""I can guzzle, like, a glass of wine in, like, two seconds. No problem. But I take a few sips of water and swallow gently, and all of a sudden, I'm like, 'I wanna puke.' ""

Tori — who is mom to five children with her ex Dean McDermott — went on to admit she did try drinking water during her pregnancies but it was tough.

She said: ""[I tried] because you have to hydrate the baby growing in you. But in my mind, I was like: 'I'm drinking for them, not myself'.""

The TV star also confessed she struggles with an ""irrational"" fear of being poisoned whenever someone hands her a drink — which baffled her ex Dean — and she joked it stems from her late father Aaron Spelling's dramatic TV shows.

She explained: ""I'm Aaron Spelling's daughter, hello. The creator of drama-rama storytelling...

""[Dean said] 'You're the mother of my children. Why would I want to poison you?' And I was like: 'Listen. It's not personal. I think this about everybody.' ""

However, Tori is convinced the fear does stem from her childhood when her mom Candy would attempt to get her to take medicine by hiding it in a drink.

She said: ""I would say: 'What'd you put in here? Like, what are you giving me?' And she would say the same thing: 'What, you think I'm trying to poison you?' ""

""This goes back to childhood. This crazy, irrational fear of handed over liquids from other people. I don't drink water. I don't call it a fear of water. I just like to say I hate water. I have an allergy to water.""

The Champions Trophy may have ended, but it is still the talk of the town. Players who performed well are discussed on and off social media. After India's victory, there is also a lot of talk about Varun Chakaravarthy, who emerged as the star of the Champions Trophy. Varun took the most wickets for India and was called Rohit Sharma's trump card. On the strength of his leg spin bowling, he helped India move towards victory. His exceptional bowling skills in the Champions Trophy 2025 have played an important role in India's success, earning him recognition as a key player in the team. By the way, do you know that Varun was an actor before joining the Indian team?

Before gaining fame as a cricketer, Varun Chakaravarthy had a great career in the entertainment industry. In the year 2014, he appeared in the Tamil film 'Jeeva', a sports drama. The film was based on his own life story. He also participated in a popular cooking reality show, in which he showcased his versatility and attracted a wide audience.

Varun played a small role in the 2014 Tamil film 'Jeeva', starring Vishnu Vishal in the lead role. At that time, Varun knew that he was playing a small role in a film that almost resembles his life story. The film revolves around a talented cricketer who struggles to keep his dream alive while fighting the system with his modest means. The protagonist is seen as a different person, a lost face at a local club, but his appearance changes in the dressing room. Even as he climbs the ladder, the tag of being different hangs over him, which almost forces him to quit cricket until a phone call from an IPL scout changes his life forever. The film ends with 'Jeeva' playing for India.

About Varun Chakaravarthy's last game

Varun Chakravarthy's brilliant performance against New Zealand in the group stage was a game-changer, taking five wickets for 42 runs and paving the way for India's 44-run victory. This impressive feat not only highlighted his skills as a 'mystery spinner' but also demonstrated the depth and strength of India's spin attack. With his brilliant performance, he seems to have cemented his place in the ODI team.

Holi festival has been depicted in several Hindi films. Several actors from Amitabh Bachchan to Shah Rukh Khan, have given memorable Holi songs and scenes. But amongst them are few movies where Holi sequences played an important role in taking the story forward. Learn about some such Hindi films here.

When Holi is shown in the film 'Raanjhanaa', Sonam Kapoor's character Zoya applies color to actor Dhanush's character, Kundan. This is the moment when Kundan gets completely immersed in Zoya's love. He becomes a part of a different world of love.

Mohabbatein

The story of Shah Rukh Khan and Amitabh's film 'Mohabbatein' shows a fight between discipline and love. Amitabh plays the role of a strict principal in it. SRK plays a music teacher in the film who explains the meaning of love to the children. Despite the strictness of Big B's character, who plays the principal in the film, some children go out and celebrate Holi with Shah Rukh. This challenges the discipline of the principal in the story.

Darr

SRK played a negative role in the film 'Darr', who secretly scares and harasses Kiran (Juhi Chawla). But in the Holi scene, Shah Rukh's character, Rahul, takes advantage of the Holi atmosphere and applies color to Kiran. In this scene, Kiran's lover and future husband, Sunil, chases Rahul but is unable to catch him.

Silsila

In the film 'Silsila', an entire song 'Rang Barse' has been filmed on Holi. But in this song, Amit's wife (Jaya Bachchan) and Chandni's husband (Sanjeev Kumar) come to know about the affair between Amit (Amitabh Bachchan) and Chandni (Rekha). The story of the film takes a different turn because of this Holi scene.

Sholay

In the film 'Sholay', Gabbar and Jai-Veeru come face to face only after the Holi song. Gabbar shows his strength and his fear to the villagers. But Jai and Veeru confront Gabbar and his goons and force them to run away. But after this, Gabbar decides to kill Jai and Veeru.

U.S. and Ukrainian negotiators have agreed to a full 30-day pause in fighting.

LONDON -- The prospect of a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine is ""in Moscow's hands,"" a top aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said following successful U.S.-Ukraine talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday.

Andriy Yermak -- the head of Zelenskyy's office -- was part of the Ukrainian delegation that met with American representatives in Jeddah, where both teams agreed to pursue a 30-day ceasefire and use the pause in fighting as a launchpad for full peace negotiations to end Russia's three-year-old invasion of its neighbor.

""Ukraine is ready to accept a 30-day ceasefire if Russia agrees,"" Yermak wrote on Telegram on Wednesday morning. ""This is a necessary step to begin work on real security guarantees and preparing the final terms of a peace agreement.""

""But now the key is in Moscow's hands -- the whole world will see who really wants to end the war and who is simply playing for time,"" he added.

Moscow was readying itself to hear details from Tuesday's U.S.-Ukraine meeting, with officials ""scrutinizing"" the publicly released statements, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday.

He added that Russia ""doesn't want to get ahead of itself"" on the potential ceasefire, saying the Kremlin will want to first get specifics directly from Washington. A ""summit phone call"" may be in the cards, he said.

President Donald Trump's return to office has put Ukraine in a strategic bind, no longer able to rely on the ""ironclad"" -- if at times hesitant, according to many Ukrainians -- American support during former President Joe Biden's time in office.

Trump has aligned with Russian narratives about the conflict, framing Ukraine as the key impediment to peace, falsely blaming Kyiv for starting the war, undermining Zelenskyy's legitimacy as president and seeking to recoup years of American aid via a controversial minerals sharing deal.

Last week, the Trump administration announced a freeze on U.S. military aid to and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. Tuesday's meeting in Saudi Arabia saw that pause lifted, officials said.

Moscow has welcomed the radical U.S. shift in rhetoric and policy, which culminated in an explosive Trump-Zelenskyy Oval Office meeting last month.

Kyiv has been striving to prove its readiness for peace while stressing that no deal can succeed without American security guarantees to deter repeat Russian aggression. Ukrainian leaders have also cast doubt on President Vladimir Putin's readiness to end the fighting and urged their U.S. partners to be wary of the Kremlin.

Following Tuesday's talks, Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram of the 30-day ceasefire plan, ""Ukraine accepts this proposal, we consider it positive, we are ready to take this step. The United States of America needs to convince Russia to do so.""

""We agree, and if the Russians agree, the silence will take effect at that very moment,"" he added. ""An important element in today's discussions is America's readiness to restore defense assistance to Ukraine and intelligence support.""

""Ukraine is ready for peace,"" Zelenskyy wrote. ""Russia must also show whether it is ready to end the war -- or continue it. The time has come for the whole truth. I thank everyone who helps Ukraine.""

Speaking in Kyiv on Wednesday, Zelenskyy said he is ""very serious"" about a ceasefire. ""For me it is important to end the war,"" he added.

""I want the president of the United States to see it, I want Americans to see and feel it,"" Zelenskyy said. ""I want Europe and all to be in alliance in order to do everything to force Russia to end this war.""

""As for the security guarantees, we will talk about them in more details if there is ceasefire for 30 days,"" the president continued. ""These 30 days are given to prepare a draft. We have our proposals, but we will draft the steps that we will agree on with our allies and formats of security guarantees which Ukraine will have after the war is over.""

""Today, everything depends on the fact whether Russia wants to cease fire or to continue killing people. Today, it fully depends on this country. United States of America demonstrated its steps and position. Ukraine demonstrated and outlined its positions in a very direct way, without any reservations. And Russia will have to answer to that.""

""I believe that the meeting itself in Saudi Arabia ruins Russian plans to escalate relations between Ukraine and United States,"" Zelenskyy said. ""On the contrary, there is de-escalation.""

Trump told reporters on Wednesday that the administration hasn't spoken to Putin yet ""with substance"" regarding the ceasefire proposal.

""We haven't spoken to him yet with substance because we just found out and we just were able to get Ukraine to agree,"" he said. ""So, we're going to know very soon. I've gotten some positive messages, but a positive message means nothing. This is a very serious situation.""

Trump would not comment on whether he has a meeting with Putin scheduled.

""But we had a great success yesterday,"" he said.

""It's up to Russia now,"" Trump said. ""But we've had a good relationship with both parties, actually. And we'll see. People are going to Russia right now as we speak. And hopefully we can get a ceasefire from Russia.""

Trump declined to get into specifics when asked what he can do to pressure Russia to agree to the ceasefire proposal.

""We can, but I hope it's not going to be necessary,"" he said.

""There are things you could do that that wouldn't be pleasant in a financial sense,"" he added, without providing any specifics. ""I can do things financially that would be very bad for Russia. I don't want to do that because I want to get peace.""

The president then reiterated his previous claim that Ukraine would be a bigger obstacle in negotiations.

""We've got Ukraine done. And, as you as you know, I've always said that Ukraine might have been the more difficult party,"" he said.

Trump said he is pressing for peace amid mounting casualties in the war, which he claimed was ""over nothing.""

""We're all working hard to get this thing finished,"" he said. ""It's crazy, over nothing, and it's not going to go anywhere. It's just a terrible situation. And I think, and I think we have a chance to get it done.""

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday that Washington, D.C., will pursue ""multiple points of contact"" with Russia to see if Putin is ready to negotiate an end to the war.

""The ball is truly in their court,"" Rubio said during a refueling stop in Shannon, Ireland, as quoted by The Associated Press. Rubio also said he hopes Russia will end attacks on Ukraine in the coming days.

""We don't think it's constructive to stand here today and say what we're going to do if Russia says no,"" Rubio said, adding he would avoid statements that ""are abrasive in any way.""

Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff -- who took part in the recent U.S. talks with both Ukraine and Russia -- is due to visit Moscow ""in the coming days,"" according to a source familiar with the plans. Russia's state-run RIA Novosti news agency also reported Wednesday that CIA Director Jim Ratcliffe spoke by phone with Sergey Naryshkin, the head of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, meanwhile, said in an interview published Wednesday that he does not believe Trump wants to provide security guarantees to Ukraine.

""He has his own view of the situation, which he regularly and directly states,"" Lavrov said. ""This war should never have started.""

Despite apparent progress in Jeddah, the fighting continues. Fierce combat is ongoing all along the front lines, particularly in the western Russian Kursk region, where Moscow's forces are pushing Ukrainian troops back from positions seized in a surprise August offensive.

Overnight, both sides launched drones across the shared border. Russia's Defense Ministry reported the downing of 21 Ukrainian UAVs.

Ukraine's air force reported three missiles and 133 drones launched into the country overnight. The air force said 98 of the drones were shot down and 20 were lost in flight without causing damage. Odesa, Kharkiv, Sumy and Kyiv regions were affected, the air force said.

Five people were killed and 12 injured due to shelling in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine on Wednesday, according to Ukrainian emergency officials.

One person was killed and 15 more were injured in strikes on the city of Kryvyi Rih, Zelenskyy's hometown, in central Ukraine, according to Ukrainian emergency officials.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is starting another round of job cuts — this one more than 1,000 — at the nation's weather, ocean and fisheries agency, four people familiar with the matter tell The Associated Press.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Tuesday began plans to lay off 10% of its current workforce, people inside and outside the agency said, with some of them requesting anonymity due to fear of retribution. The numbers were presented to NOAA employees and managers were asked to submit names of positions for layoffs to agency headquarters, which will then go to NOAA's parent agency, the Department of Commerce, on Wednesday, the people said.

Three former senior NOAA officials — two former political appointees from the Biden administration — who speak regularly with managers at their old agency used the same number for upcoming job cuts: 1,029, 10% of the current 10,290. They talked to multiple people still in NOAA and a current agency worker detailed the cuts that a manager explained to employees. 

While most people know about NOAA and its daily weather forecasts, the agency also monitors and warns about hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and tsunamis, manages the country's fisheries, runs marine sanctuaries, provides navigation information to ships and observes changes in the climate and oceans. The agency also plays a role in warning about avalanches and space weather that could damage the electrical grid. It helps respond to disasters, including oil spills.

The new cuts come after earlier rounds of Trump administration firings and encouraged retirements at NOAA, plus the elimination of nearly all new employees last month. After this upcoming round of cuts, NOAA will have eliminated about one out of four jobs since President Donald Trump took office in January. 




“This is not government efficiency,” said former NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad. “It is the first steps toward eradication. There is no way to make these kinds of cuts without removing or strongly compromising mission capabilities.”

The cuts are being ordered without specific guidance from the Trump administration on how or where, which makes it even worse, Spinrad said.

NOAA spokeswoman Monica Allen said the agency's policy is not to discuss internal personnel matters, but said NOAA will “continue to provide weather information, forecasts and warnings pursuant to our public safety mission.”

NOAA has already stopped releasing some weather balloons that gather crucial observations for forecasts in two locations — Albany, New York, and Gray, Maine — because of lack of staffing, the agency said last week.

This is all happening as severe storm system is forecast to move through the central and southern parts of the nation late this week in a multi-day outburst with strong tornadoes, hail and damaging winds expected. 

Weather forecasts will worsen and “people are going to start seeing this very quickly,” warned former NOAA chief scientist Craig McLean. It will also limit how much commercial fishermen will be able to catch, he said.

On top of all the job losses, cuts in research grants to universities will also make it harder for the U.S. to keep improving its weather forecasts and better monitor what's happening to the planet, McLean said.

“People are silently watching the United States decline as a technological leader,” McLean said. “America got to the moon, but our weather forecasts won't be the greatest.”

A Russian national was revealed to be the captain of the cargo ship that collided with a U.S. tanker off the coast of England in an incident that sparked a massive fire, spilled jet fuel into the sea and left one person feared dead. 

The 59-year-old man remained in United Kingdom police custody Wednesday after being detained on suspicion of manslaughter by gross negligence, according to Ernst Russ, the owner of the Portugal-flagged Solong cargo ship. It added that the ship's 14 crew members were a mix of Russian and Filipino nationals. One of them remains missing and is presumed dead. 

The Solong collided Monday with MV Stena Immaculate, a U.S.-flagged tanker transporting jet fuel for the American military. U.S.-based Crowley Ship Management said the MV Stena Immaculate was anchored near Hull when it was struck and that all 23 onboard are ""safe and accounted for"" with no reported injuries. 

Leading up to the collision, the Solong was inspected in Dublin last July and was found to have 10 deficiencies, according to The Associated Press.

Port inspection documents show the Solong failed steering-related safety checks with the vessel's ""emergency steering position communications/compass reading"" unreadable. It also had ""inadequate"" alarms, survival craft ""not properly maintained"" and fire doors ""not as required."" 

Then a second inspection in Scotland in October found two more deficiencies, but the ship was not detained after either inspection, the AP reported. 

However, U.K. authorities said they do not suspect foul play in the crash.

The 596-foot Stena Immaculate was operating as part of the U.S. government's Tanker Security Program, a group of commercial vessels that can be contracted to carry fuel for the military when needed. 

""Crowley continues to work closely with U.K. agencies to support the incident response, salvage and environmental impact mitigation operations resulting from container ship Solong striking the Crowley-managed tanker Stena Immaculate while at anchor on Monday, March 10,"" the ship's owner said Tuesday.

""It remains uncertain at this time what volume of fuel may have been released as a result of the incident, but initial review shows impacts have been limited due to exposure to the fire and evaporation of the Jet A1 fuel,"" Crowley continued. ""In addition, U.K. agencies are closely monitoring air quality and any possible public health impacts resulting onshore. Both are currently measuring low or within normal levels.""

""Reduction in force"" notifications went out to 1,315 employees Tuesday.

The Department of Education initiated mass layoffs on Tuesday night, reducing its workforce by nearly 50%, sources told ABC News.

The ""reduction in force"" notices began to go out at about 6 p.m.

Some 1,315 employees were affected by the RIFs, leaving 2,183 employed by the department, according to senior officials at the DOE.

Impacted staff will be placed on administrative leave starting March 21, a statement from the Education Department said. They will receive full pay and benefits through June 9, senior officials added.

The statement also said that the DOE will ""continue to deliver on all statutory programs that fall under the agency's purview, including formula funding, student loans, Pell Grants, funding for special needs students, and competitive grantmaking.""

""Today's reduction in force reflects the Department of Education's commitment to efficiency, accountability, and ensuring that resources are directed where they matter most: to students, parents, and teachers,"" said Secretary of Education Linda McMahon shortly after the notifications went out on Tuesday.

""I appreciate the work of the dedicated public servants and their contributions to the Department,"" she said. ""This is a significant step toward restoring the greatness of the United States education system.""

The downsizing impacts “every” sector of the department in some way, according to senior department of education officials.

“This is primarily a streamlining effort for internal facing roles and not external facing roles,” senior officials said.

Following the flurry of layoff notifications, those who remained employed by the DOE received their own email. ABC News obtained a copy, which said, in part: ""As we move forward, our mission and responsibilities will remain, but there will need to be significant changes to the way that we work. What we choose to prioritize, and in turn, not prioritize, will be critical in this transition.""

""Please know that these decisions were not made lightly, and in no way reflect on the dedication and hard work of those who are leaving,"" it said, before referring to this moment as the DOE's ""final mission"" and suggesting: ""Let's continue to move forward as a team.""

In next steps, six communications offices are going to be consolidated, officials explained, and leases will end in major cities including San Francisco, New York, Cleveland, Boston, Chicago and Dallas.

The three DOE buildings in Washington, D.C., will also eventually be consolidated, according to the senior officials.

The announcement came shortly after DOE employees were told that their offices -- including those in the National Capital Region, along with regional locations -- would be closed for the day on Wednesday.

Citing ""security reasons,"" an email went out saying that the buildings would be inaccessible starting at 6 p.m., a source within the department told ABC News.

""You must vacate the building by that time,"" a department email to employees reads in part, adding ""All ED offices in the NCR and the regions will be closed to employees and contractor employees on Wednesday, March 12th.""

Senior officials later elaborated that the safety precautions were meant to protect the remaining employees who retained their positions with the DOE.

The email also instructed employees to take their laptops home with them after work on Tuesday.

""Please take your laptop with you when you depart on Tuesday. Employees will not be permitted in any ED facility on Wednesday March 12th for any reason.  All offices will reopen on Thursday, March 13th, at which time in-person presence will resume,"" the email said.

The email also said that employees with approved telework agreements may work from home; however, such telework agreements are largely no longer in place, an employee told ABC News. The DOE called for its total workforce to return to its offices late last month.

The closure notification comes as President Donald Trump weighs an executive order to shutter the agency and transfer education oversight to the states. The decision to sign that order was delayed due to concerns over questions the administration might get about vital programs that could potentially be gutted by it.

Inside the department, employees are bracing for uncertain futures.

""People are petrified to do their jobs,"" an Education Department employee told ABC News recently. ""People are worried about like, if I push back on something that somebody wants to do, right, and I say, that's not really what the law says or is legal, am I going to get a bad performance and now they use a bad performance to kick me out?""

""Everyone here is holding their breath,"" the DOE employee added.

National Education Association President Becky Pringle released a statement in response to the layoffs on Tuesday, saying: ""Firing -- without cause -- nearly half of the Department of Education staff means they are getting rid of the dedicated public servants who help ensure our nation's students have access to the programs and resources to keep class sizes down and expand learning opportunities for students so they can grow into their full brilliance. The Trump administration has abandoned students, parents, and educators across the nation.""

The U.S. Department of Education will lay off all employees at its Dallas office, NBC News reported.

The Dallas office is just one of the regional offices getting eliminated as part of national cuts to the agency. Other affected offices include San Francisco, New York, Boston, Chicago and Cleveland, according to NBC.

The Education Department announced plans Tuesday to lay off over 1,300 of its more than 4,000 employees as part of a reorganization that's seen as a prelude to President Donald Trump's plan to dismantle the agency.

Even before the layoffs, the Education Department was among the smallest Cabinet-level agencies. Its workforce included 3,100 people in Washington and an additional 1,100 at regional offices across the country, according to a department website.

It was not immediately clear how many of those regional employees worked out of the Dallas office. Each regional office oversaw a group of states, which included Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico and Oklahoma for the Dallas office. 

The layoffs are part of a downsizing of the federal government directed by Trump. Thousands of jobs are expected to be cut across the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Social Security Administration and other agencies.

Education Secretary Linda McMahon told employees to brace for profound cuts in a memo issued March 3, the day she was confirmed by the Senate. She said it was the department's “final mission” to eliminate bureaucratic bloat and turn over the agency's authority to states. At McMahon's confirmation hearing, she acknowledged only Congress has the power to abolish the agency but said it might be due for cuts and a reorganization.

There are concerns the cuts will affect some of the agency's most fundamental work, including the enforcement of civil rights for students with disabilities and the management of $1.6 trillion in federal student loans.

The education department's Office for Civil Rights enforces federal laws that protect students against discrimination. It responds to complaints based on race, disability, age and national origin discrimination, among others. The cuts will deeply erode the division, ProPublica reported. 

The office received a record number of complaints in fiscal year 2024, with roughly 22,700 reports filed, according to its annual report. That figure has almost tripled since 2009. 

A public database of cases under investigation recently showed more than 1,000 results for Texas, including those at colleges, universities and K-12 school districts. 

The fate of those cases is unknown. Office for Civil Rights investigations often take months or years to complete. Families were frustrated with the delays even before the Trump administration cuts.

The department sent an email to employees Tuesday telling them its Washington headquarters and regional offices would be closed Wednesday, with access forbidden, before reopening Thursday. The only reason given for the closures was unspecified “security reasons.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news","The U.S. has covertly destabilized nations. With Canada, it's being done in public","https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trump-annexation-destabilizing-canada-1.7479890","Wed, 12 Mar 2025 15:51:31 GMT","

Former senior Canadian intelligence officials say Canada needs to be on the lookout for campaigns aimed at destabilizing the country amid U.S. President Donald Trump's escalating 51st state threats.

And they told CBC News that the most potent weapon wielded by the Trump administration to advance the cause of annexation would likely not be the intelligence agencies directed by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard.

""I would regard Mr. Musk as a problem,"" said Ward Elcock, who headed CSIS for a decade including during the 9/11 attacks and also served as national security adviser. ""I think that's on a number of fronts.""

The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has worked to destabilize many governments and nations in the past, using methods as mundane as corruption and as drastic as assassination, but the former spy chiefs say a campaign aimed at Canada would likely rely less on cloak-and-dagger tactics and more on social media — such as the Elon Musk-owned X platform.

""Is [Trump] trying to change political views in this country? If so, that's foreign interference,"" said Dick Fadden, who also headed CSIS and served as national security adviser to former prime minister Stephen Harper.

""It's no more acceptable from the United States than it is from China or Russia or anybody else.""

Neil Bisson is a former CSIS intelligence officer who is now director of the Global Intelligence Knowledge Network and teaches at the University of Ottawa's Professional Development Institute.

He says that in spite of visible signs of Canadian unity in the face of annexation threats, there are those who are vulnerable to the siren call, particularly among the young who feel economically disadvantaged.

""That would be one of the linchpins, one of the cracks in the armour that another country would be looking at trying to exploit,"" he told CBC News. ""If you have individuals who are concerned about where their next meal is coming from or if they're going to get a roof over their head, that supersedes sovereignty.""

Tariff war: Does Trump actually know what he's doing? | About That

He said those Canadians could be targeted by propaganda campaigns that sell American citizenship as the answer to their economic woes.

""And there will be individuals within Canada who could potentially be co-opted to push that narrative forward,"" said Bisson.

Trump administration officials have given numerous rationales for the tariffs against Canada, but Trump himself has said that he wants to use economic force to join Canada to the U.S. On Tuesday morning, he again said Canada could only avoid economic ruin through annexation.

""He intends clearly to try and destabilize our economy,"" said Elcock. ""The reality is that if Canada is really impoverished, people may start to think about it. That's always the possibility — that not all Canadians are going to be willing to endure economic deprivation. And so some may start to think about it as time goes along.""

Fadden says governments and intelligence agencies have learned the hard way of the power of disinformation and propaganda channelled through social media.

""You keep repeating things often enough, people start believing it,"" he said. ""If it continues down this path for years, virtually anybody can be worn down.""

In addition to sending politicians to negotiate with counterparts in Washington, says Fadden, ""we need to find a way to play back on the information front.""

He says that means finding ways ""to use social media more effectively than I believe we have been doing.""

Bisson says government assistance for those affected by tariffs could blunt the impact of such propaganda.

""This is the Canadian government trying to shore up that political opinion within their own citizenship to say, 'OK we've got this covered, we're going to take care of you no matter what,'"" he said.

""Because if that wasn't done and things were starting to destabilize economically, that would give people even more reason to fall back on thinking, well, maybe it's a better idea if we've just succumbed to this.""

The intelligence professionals say it's possible that the U.S. government would use more intrusive tactics, such as fomenting or financing pro-annexationist groups within Canada to create the impression of a groundswell of support for the idea.

""They have an extraordinary capacity to do this,"" said Fadden. ""The real issue to me is whether in respect of Canada, they will actually make use of those capabilities and resources.""

He says Canada should be on the lookout. ""We need to start at the basics. We need to start monitoring money flows. We need to start talking about whether they're trying to interfere with our elections at all levels.""

But he says covert operations on Canadian soil would likely offer the U.S. little return in exchange for a great deal of risk. And Trump is typically his own messenger, preferring the megaphone to the coded message.

""I would argue that the current president's approach is likely to be as effective as using the relatively secret resources of the CIA or the U.S. intelligence community,"" Fadden said.

The former spy chiefs say U.S. intelligence agencies have rarely operated in Canada in the past, and would need time to develop networks. It would be difficult for them to get very far without alerting the Canadians to their presence, said Elcock.

""Intelligence organizations are out looking for possible threats all the time,"" he said, and have intelligence ""tripwires"" set up to help monitor the threat environment.

""The likelihood that the Americans would run afoul of something, like of a tripwire at some point or talk to somebody who then would report it — those things are highly probable,"" he said.

Intelligence professionals who spoke to CBC News all said that they put some faith in the professionalism of their U.S. counterparts, and their historic attachments to alliances such as Five Eyes and NATO.

Elcock said U.S. agencies would have to worry about their own people talking.

""There is a long relationship between Canada and the United States and there will still be people around who would not necessarily approve. So I don't think they could with any certainty carry out something like that — that wasn't a very, very closely held operation,"" he said.

But those calculations could change if the Trump administration continues to remove and replace personnel in the agencies down to the managerial and operational level.

""The more you get people who buy into the current U.S. president's philosophy of life,"" said Fadden, ""the more he shifts professionals out of the intelligence community and puts his own people in, the more worrisome it becomes.""

As for those Canadians who want to see their country annexed, and have loudly made that case, Elcock says not all should necessarily be seen as a security threat.

""It would depend on what their activities were. There are lots of people who have weird ideas in Canada who don't qualify as a threat to the security of Canada,"" he said. ""Many of those organizations would already be on the radar. So the reality is, if they start to become active, it's not going to be something nobody's aware of.""

The experts all said that Canada is a much more resilient target than other countries where the U.S. is known to have conducted destabilization operations, but that doesn't mean it is immune to pressure.

""We need to worry more and talk more about the medium and long term, rather than just worrying about the critically important tariffs that are there now,"" said Fadden.

He warned if Canada is subjected to a prolonged campaign of economic warfare, then ""at some point somebody's going to have to cry uncle.""

While Fadden doesn't see a military invasion on the horizon, he said ""economic and cultural control of the country can be just as effective.""

The president has described Mahmoud Khalil's arrest as the first ‘of many to come.' And experts say, while not common, revoking green cards does happen.

Can Trump Deport a Green Card Holder?

Seth Wenig|AP

Protesters demonstrate for the release of Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, on March 11, in Newark, New Jersey. 




ICE officers arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a recent graduate of Columbia University, after he helped lead 2024 campus protests against Israel's actions in Gaza.
President Donald Trump has promised the arrest is the first “of many to come.”
As the government attempts to deport Khalil, who is in the U.S. legally, analysts say the administration has a lot of discretion in situations like these.




The arrest of a Columbia University graduate over the weekend has prompted fierce backlash as President Donald Trump moves to punish pro-Palestinian protesters at colleges and universities by raising the specter of deportation.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers on Saturday arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a December graduate with a master's degree from the university's School of International and Public Affairs, after he helped lead campus demonstrations last year protesting Israel's actions in Gaza since the start of the war against Hamas.

Such protests spread to college campuses nationwide, but they were particularly virulent at Columbia, where in-person classes were canceled, students took over an administrative building and police were called in to clear their encampment. Jewish students complained of feeling threatened and ostracized, and reports of antisemitic language and imagery were widespread.

Khalil, who remains at risk of deportation even though his removal was initially blocked by a federal judge, holds a green card and is married to an American citizen, according to The New York Times. The same judge on Wednesday ruled that Khalil will remain at a Louisiana detention center temporarily as he weighs arguments.

The White House – and the president himself – nonetheless boasted about Khalil's arrest on social media, with Trump pledging, “This is the first arrest of many to come,” and claiming “there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity.” The post came after his administration on Friday canceled $400 million in federal grants and contracts to Columbia because of what it said was the university's failure to combat antisemitism on campus – the first of what will likely be more actions targeting universities.

Elliott Davis Jr.Feb. 26, 2025



Secretary of State Marco Rubio also said in his own post that the administration “will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.”

“If you support terrorism, including the slaughtering of innocent men, women, and children, your presence is contrary to our national and foreign policy interests, and you are not welcome here,” Trump's post reads. “We expect every one of America's Colleges and Universities to comply.”

The latest escalation comes after Trump issued an executive order in January aimed at combating antisemitism that directed officials to explore investigations of foreign-born students accused of antisemitic actions on college campuses and consider “if warranted, actions to remove such aliens.” The White House later promised more directly to “deport Hamas sympathizers and revoke student visas.”

The legal basis for Khalil's arrest has not been disclosed publicly, but the Times reported that the administration is relying on a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which states, “an alien whose presence or activities in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable ground to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States is deportable.” That text closely mirrors the language used in the president's Truth Social post regarding “national and foreign policy interests.”

The American Civil Liberties Union released a statement on Monday condemning the arrest as “unprecedented, illegal, and un-American.” But others say there are nuances when it comes to the legality of the Trump administration's move. Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a lawyer and analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, notes “how much discretion” the U.S. government has when it comes to granting benefits such as green cards, visas and asylum.

“The U.S. government has a number of ways or justifications for removing people's benefits and deporting them,” she notes, while adding that it is “somewhat common for lawful permanent residents to be ordered deported.”

This is partly because lawful permanent resident status does not come with the same rights American citizens have. Linda Dakin-Grimm, an attorney who concentrates on pro bono immigration matters and also is a senior consulting partner at Milbank LLP, says she stresses this distinction when she represents people who get green cards. She notes that “if you engage in certain conduct, you'll probably have the consequences of that conduct,” including losing lawful permanent residence status.

“The issue is going to come down to: Did (Khalil) do something that they can prove that violated the terms of his current status?” Dakin-Grimm says. “And if he did, then it's a kind of cautionary tale.”

READ: 



One of the things someone with a green card is prohibited from doing is “committing fraud in any way in the process,” Dakin-Grimm adds. For instance, she says the application has “about 100 questions on it that ask you 50 ways to Sunday: ‘Do you have any connection with terrorist organizations?'” Dakin-Grimm clarifies that she's not saying this is the case with Khalil, but if he has “some sort of provable relationship with Hamas” – which the U.S. designates as a terrorist organization – and he did not disclose it on his application, “that alone could be enough to revoke his green card.” If this is part of the federal government's evidence, the attorneys have the burden of proving it in front of an immigration judge – an administrative position that falls under the Department of Justice, she notes.

Heightened scrutiny about possible affiliations with terrorist organizations is not new, Bush-Joseph says. It's one product of the post-9/11 world. A Government Accountability Office report from 2009 about actions needed at the time to address vulnerabilities in the process for granting permanent residency noted concerns “that terrorists or their supporters would seek to immigrate to the United States.”

“On the other hand, as a general matter, I can say that the Trump administration has already demonstrated that it's willing to really push the boundaries of immigration law and constitutional norms,” Bush-Joseph adds. “What additional authorities or policies and procedures will the Trump administration try to invoke?”

US Trade Rep Greer Says EU Retaliation Ignores US National Security Needs

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said on Wednesday that the European Union's retaliation against President Donald Trump's strengthened steel and aluminum tariffs shows that the bloc's trade policies are ""out of step with reality.""

Greer, in a rare public statement since taking office in late February, said the EU's retaliatory tariffs on 26 billion euros ($28 billion) worth of U.S. goods are contradictory to the bloc's resistance to U.S. efforts to work with the EU to deal with global excess capacity in the metals.

""The EU's punitive action completely disregards the national security imperatives of the United States – and indeed international security – and is yet another indicator that the EU's trade and economic policies are out of step with reality,"" Greer said.

UK Pollution Fears Ease After Cargo Ship Crash, Russian Captain Still in Detention

By Jonathan Saul and Sarah Young

LONDON (Reuters) - Fears of an environmental disaster eased on Wednesday, two days after a container ship ploughed into a stationary U.S. fuel tanker off northeast England, as the vessel's owner said the detained captain was a Russian national.

The Portuguese-flagged Solong had crashed with no obvious explanation into the larger Stena Immaculate, a tanker carrying jet fuel for the U.S. military.

Huge fires and explosions charred the Solong and left the Immaculate with a gaping hole, but owner Stena Bulk said most of its jet fuel cargo remained intact.

Stena Bulk Chief Executive Erik Hanell said only two of 18 fuel tanks had leaked, or about 10% of the cargo.

""We will have a much clearer picture in the next 24-48 hours on the whole salvage operation,"" he told Reuters.

Fuel leaked into the sea on Monday, raising fears for protected bird colonies, but the British coastguard said there had been no further reports of pollution from either vessel since then.

Fires on the Solong, which was being held in position by a tug, were greatly reduced on Wednesday, while no flames were visible on the Stena Immaculate, the coastguard said.

MORE:  

British police have arrested Solong's 59-year-old captain on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter.

Ernst Russ, the German company that owns the Solong, confirmed that he was a Russian national. The other 13 crew, one of whom is missing and presumed dead, are Russians and Filipinos.

The West's ties with Russia are under heavy strain over the war in Ukraine, and worries about sabotage of power cables, telecom links and gas pipelines have grown since a string of outages in the Baltic following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Russia's embassy in London did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

Russians account for an estimated 11% of the global seafarer workforce, according to shipping officials.

The Stena Immaculate was at anchor when it was struck, making the collision particularly surprising, given the safety systems that modern vessels carry. But a spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said there is no suggestion of ""foul play"".

The Stena Immaculate's 23 crew - all U.S. nationals according to Stena Bulk - were evacuated safely.

Maritime safety records suggest minor issues were found when the Solong underwent routine inspections last year, but none justified detaining it.

Ernst Russ said all the deficiencies had been ""promptly rectified"".

Britain's Marine Accident Investigation Branch will gather initial evidence, but overall responsibility for the investigation lies in the U.S. and Portugal, the ships' flag states.

The European Union on Wednesday announced retaliatory trade action with new duties on U.S. industrial and farm products, responding within hours to the Trump administration's increase in tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25 per cent.

The world's biggest trading bloc was expecting the U.S. tariffs and prepared in advance, but the measures still place great strain on already tense transatlantic relations. Only last month, Washington warned Europe that it would have to take care of its own security in the future.

The EU measures will cover goods from the United States worth some 26 billion euros (US$28 billion), and not just steel and aluminum products, but also textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods. Motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans will be hit, as they were during President Donald Trump‘s first term.

The EU duties aim for pressure points in the U.S. while minimizing additional damage to Europe. The tariffs — taxes on imports — primarily target Republican-held states, hitting soybeans in House Speaker Mike Johnson's Louisiana, but also beef and poultry in Kansas and Nebraska. Produce in Alabama, Georgia and Virginia is also on the list.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement that the bloc “will always remain open to negotiation.”

“As the U.S. are applying tariffs worth $28 billion, we are responding with countermeasures worth 26 billion euros,” she said. The commission manages trade and commercial conflicts on behalf of the 27 member EU countries.

“We firmly believe that in a world fraught with geopolitical and economic uncertainties, it is not in our common interest to burden our economies with tariffs,” von der Leyen said.

Trump said his taxes would help create U.S. factory jobs, but von der Leyen said: “Jobs are at stake. Prices will go up. In Europe and in the United States.”

“We deeply regret this measure. Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business, and even worse for consumers. These tariffs are disrupting supply chains. They bring uncertainty for the economy,” she said.

The American Chamber of Commerce to the EU said the U.S. tariffs and EU countermeasures “will only harm jobs, prosperity and security on both sides of the Atlantic.”

“The two sides must de-escalate and find a negotiated outcome urgently,” the chamber said Wednesday.

Trump slapped similar tariffs on EU steel and aluminum during his first term in office, which enraged European and other allies. The EU also imposed countermeasures in retaliation at the time, raising tariffs on U.S.-made motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans, among other items.

This time, the EU action will involve two steps. First, on April 1, the commission will reintroduce what it calls “rebalancing measures,” which the EU had from 2018 and 2020 but which were suspended under the Biden administration. Then on April 13 come the additional duties targeting 18 billion euros (US$19.6 billion) in U.S. exports to the bloc.

EU Trade Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič travelled to Washington last month in an effort to head off the tariffs, meeting with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and other top trade officials.

He said on Wednesday that it became clear during the trip that “the EU is not the problem.”

“I argued to avoid the unnecessary burden of measures and countermeasures, but you need a partner for that. You need both hands to clap,” Šefčovič told reporters at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France.

The EU could lose up to 3.7 million tons of steel exports, according to the European steel association Eurofer. The U.S. is the second biggest export market for EU steel producers, representing 16 per cent of the total EU steel exports.

The EU estimates that annual trade volume between both sides stands at about US$1.5 trillion, representing some 30 per cent of global trade. While the bloc has a substantial export surplus in goods, it says that is partly offset by the U.S. surplus in the trade of services.

Britain, which isn't part of the EU, meanwhile said it won't impose retaliatory measures of its own on the U.S. British Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said Wednesday he would “continue to engage closely and productively with the U.S. to press the case for U.K. business interests.”

He did not rule out future tariffs on U.S. imports, saying “we will keep all options on the table and won't hesitate to respond in the national interest.”

McHugh reported from Frankfurt. Associated Press writer Jill Lawless in London contributed to this report.

U.S. consumer prices increased less than expected in February, but the improvement is likely temporary against the backdrop of aggressive tariffs on imports that are expected to raise the costs of most goods in the months ahead.

The consumer price index rose 0.2 per cent last month after accelerating 0.5 per cent in January, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Wednesday.

In the 12 months through February, the CPI increased 2.8 per cent after climbing three per cent in January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI gaining 0.3 per cent and advancing 2.9 per cent year over year.

The first full inflation report of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration still left prices running at levels that economists say are inconsistent with the Federal Reserve's two per cent target. Trump early this month triggered a trade war, increasing the tariffs on goods from China to 20 per cent and imposing a new 25 per cent duty on Canadian and Mexican imports, before dialling back and providing a one-month exemption for any goods that meet the rules of origin under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade.

Enhanced steel and aluminum tariffs took effect this week, drawing swift retaliation from Europe.

Consumers, fearful of higher prices, likely rushed to buy goods like motor vehicles and other big-ticket items, which could show up in February and if not, then in the coming months.

Consumers' inflation expectations shot up in February.

“The longer that inflation runs above the Fed's target, even if it is due to temporary forces like tariffs, the greater the chance that expectations de-anchor to the upside,” said Stephen Juneau, a U.S. economist at Bank of America Securities. “Were that to happen, restoring price stability would be that much harder for the Fed.”

Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI climbed 0.2 per cent in February after gaining 0.4 pe cent in January. In the 12 months through February, the so-called core CPI increased 3.1 per cent after rising 3.3 per cent in January.

Following the cascade of tariffs, economists have upgraded their inflation forecasts.

Goldman Sachs estimates the core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, one of the measures tracked by the Fed for monetary policy, will pick up from 2.65 per cent in January to around three per cent by December. It had forecast annual core PCE inflation remaining in the mid-two per cent area for the rest of the year.

The U.S. central bank is expected to keep its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged in the 4.25 per cent to 4.50 per cent range next Wednesday. Financial markets expect the Fed to resume cutting rates in June because of the deteriorating economic outlook, after pausing in January.

The policy rate has been reduced by 100 basis points since September 2024, when the Fed started its easing cycle. The central bank hiked the policy rate by 5.25 percentage points in 2022 and 2023 to tame inflation.

On Monday morning, about 13 miles off the coast of East Yorkshire, the Solong sailed into the US-registered tanker Stena Immaculate, which was carrying fuel for the US Navy. Fires broke out on board both vessels, 36 people were rescued and one is missing presumed dead.

The arrested captain of the Solong - the container ship involved in the crash in the North Sea - is a Russian national, the vessel's owner has said.

The rest of the crew were Russian and Filipino nationals, according to German shipping company Ernst Russ.

It comes after police said a man had been arrested on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter in connection with Monday's collision.

Humberside Police said a 59-year-old is in custody to allow enquiries to take place, and officers are talking to those involved to find out what happened.

The force added investigators have started a criminal probe into the cause of the collision between the US-registered Stena Immaculate and the Portuguese-flagged Solong about 13 miles off the coast of East Yorkshire on Monday, and are working with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency.

The tanker was carrying Jet-A1 fuel for the US Navy as part of a United States government programme designed to supply American armed forces with fuel when required, a military spokesman told Reuters.

On Monday, maritime security sources told Reuters there was no indication of any malicious activity or other actors involved in the incident and UK authorities have also said they have so far found no evidence of foul play in the crash.

Humberside detectives are working with the UK's Marine Accident Investigation Branch, and it's been reported that authorities from the US and Portugal will lead the investigation into what happened.

The Stena Immaculate, operated by US firm Crowley, was stationary and at anchor while waiting for a berth to become available at the Port of Killingholme, on the River Humber, when it was struck by the smaller Solong, causing huge fires and explosions - the smoke from which was visible from space.

The Solong had been sailing from Grangemouth in Scotland to Rotterdam in the Netherlands at the time. It was initially feared it was carrying sodium cyanide but the German owner Ernst Russ said four containers on the vessel had previously been carrying the chemical.

One missing, presumed dead

One person remains missing and is presumed dead.

In the immediate aftermath of the collision, dozens of people were forced to abandon the vessels as they caught fire.

Coastguard rescued 36 people after the alarm was raised at 9.48am on Monday, with ambulances lining up at a nearby port as emergency services readied their response.

All 23 people on board the oil tanker Stena Immaculate were accounted for, but one of the 14 crew members of the Solong is still missing.

A search for them was called off Monday evening.

Stena Bulk, the owner of the Immaculate, said on Wednesday the 23 members of its crew were all American and in ""good health"". Crowley said they were staying in Grimsby and being supported.

Ernst Russ said that it's surviving sailors were also being given ""every support possible"", and that its thought remained with the family of the lost crew member. It thanked all those who had responded.

""Ernst Russ is working with the authorities in the investigations now under way to more fully understand these events and learn from the findings,"" a statement said.

Solong failed safety checks

It has emerged that the Solong failed steering-related safety checks last year.

Port state control (PSC) inspection documents from July last year show how officials warned that the ship's ""emergency steering position communications/compass reading"" was ""not readable"".

It was among 10 issues highlighted during an inspection by Irish officials.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player



Other issues included the alarms being ""inadequate"", survival craft not being properly maintained and fire doors ""not as required"".

Another inspection, this time in Scotland in October 2024, found two issues with the Solong.

One of these was related to lifebuoys, warning they were ""not properly marked"".

Ernst Russ said in a statement ""that all deficiencies that were detected during routine port state control inspections of the Solong back in 2024 were promptly rectified"".

Environmental impact not as severe as initially feared

The Stena Immaculate had been carrying 220,000 barrels of jet fuel in 16 segregated cargo tanks - at least one of which ""was ruptured"" during the collision, shipping company Crowley said.

But it added that the jet fuel spill was having a ""limited"" impact.

The potential environmental impact seems to be less severe than initially feared.

Most of the spilt jet fuel has evaporated or burned off, Crowley said in an X post. There seems to have been no loss of engine fuel from either vessel and both are expected to remain afloat despite a gaping hole in the side of the Stena Immaculate and earlier fears the Solong would sink.

There are no visible flames on either ship, and the Solong, which was drifting, has now been secured by tugs.

The chief executive for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), Virginia McVea, said on Wednesday morning: ""There have been no further reports of pollution to the sea from either vessel beyond what was observed during the initial incident. HM Coastguard's counter pollution and salvage team has a comprehensive counter pollution response in place should it be required. Salvors also have equipment and personnel ready to respond to any pollution.

""The overarching objective is to protect the public and the environment to the best of our ability, during this ongoing incident response.

""This morning's assessment shows the fires on board the [Solong] have greatly reduced in their extent and intensity.

""The Stena Immaculate remains at anchor, with safety tugs in position should they be required. There are no visible flames on board and an on-board assessment may be carried out later today.

""Salvors will only board the vessels when it is safe to do so. Only then will it be possible to carry out comprehensive damage assessments.""","{'href': 'https://news.sky.com', 'title': 'Sky News'}"

PM: 'All options on the table' after UK hit by tariffs

Edited by Emily Atkinson

That's it for another week of Prime Minister's Questions, which saw Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch spar over the economy. 

It was Lib Dem leader Ed Davey that cracked open the matter of Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminium. The PM told the Commons he was negotiating an economic deal with the US and he would keep ""all options on the table"".



Otherwise, that's it from us. Catch you next week - same time, same place.

 In PMQs, Keir Starmer compared the Conservatives' record on immigration returns with that of the current Labour government. 

He said: “we've got the flights off - 19,000 people [have been] removed who shouldn't be here”.

It's true that the Home Office did record 18,987 returns between July 2024 and January 2025 but it is misleading to imply that all of them were actively removed as the figures show a significant number left voluntarily.

Only a quarter of the nearly 19,000 were what the Home Office classifies as “enforced returns”, when an individual is forcibly removed from the country by enforcement agents.

The majority were classified as “voluntary returns” - meaning people who choose to leave of their own accord.

Another set of returns figures (from July to December) show that around a third of voluntary returns were given some sort of financial assistance by the government to help them leave. 

By Anthony Reuben

Kemi Badenoch criticised the prime minister on the basis that council tax is going up in April “after he promised to freeze it”.

The promise to freeze council tax was part of Labour's campaign for the 2023 local elections in England.

Keir Starmer said in March 2023 that he would have frozen council tax the following year if he had been in government.

But Rachel Reeves was asked on the same day whether that meant council tax would be frozen if Labour won the general election and she said: ""We'll have to see what the public finances look like going into a general election.""

The pledge to freeze council tax was not in the Labour manifesto for last year's general election and we have not been able to find any pledges from the prime minister to do so during that  campaign.

Earlier on, Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said many in Parliament believe the PM ought to be ""more robust"" with US President Donald Trump.

His comments came after US-imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium came into effect overnight. 

Starmer responded by saying that the UK would take a ""pragmatic"" approach and ""keep all options on the table"".

PM: 'All options on the table' after UK hit by tariffs

Joshua NevettReporting from the House of Commons

The row over sentencing guidelines came up and caused a ruckus at PMQs.

So what's it's all about?

It was triggered after the Sentencing Council, which advises judges on prison terms and community punishments, issued new guidance, external for England and Wales.

The new guidelines told judges to order a pre-sentence report if the offender is from a minority background, facing the possibility of jail for the first time, a woman or pregnant.

Opposition politicians had claimed the changes amounted to a ""two-tier justice"" system.

And last week, Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood wrote to the council urging it to rethink guidance.

Now the Conservatives are trying to put Starmer under more political pressure to go further.

Watch: Sir Keir Starmer asked about welfare at PMQs

The government is planning to make some cuts to welfare and there was some unease over this among Labour MPs sat on the backbenches at PMQs. 

The Labour MP for Leeds East, Richard Burgon, called for a wealth tax, rather than cuts to benefits.

Watching on from the gallery above the chamber was Labour MP Rachel Maskell, who nodded her head, seemingly in agreement.

Maskell recently told the BBC she had picked up ""deep, deep concern"" among Labour MPs.

She said: ""I look in the past at what Labour has achieved in this space and believe that we can hold on to our values, ensure that we're helping people and not harming people.""

The BBC understands MPs have been going into Downing Street for briefings about the welfare changes.

Starmer clearly has some work to do to convince sceptical MPs of the merits of his plans.

Prime Minister's Questions is over for another week. Here's what happened: 



Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell raises Starmer's meeting later today with the family of David Amess, after Kemi Badenoch did the same a little earlier. 

He asks the prime minister to reverse the decision to deny the family a public inquiry into the death of Amess and the failure of the Prevent programme.

Starmer responds by acknowledging how heartbroken the family are, and says it's important they meet this afternoon and ""discuss all the questions they want to raise with me"".

And that's the end of PMQs. We've got further updates and analysis on the way, though - stick with us.

We're now into the section of PMQs where backbench MPs get to ask Starmer the questions on their minds. We'll bring you any key exchanges in our next few posts. 

One such question comes from SNP MP Dave Doogan, who asks the prime minister if he can reassure the Commons that US President Donald Trump is listening to the UK - with regards to reaching a peace deal for Russia's war in Ukraine.

Starmer says there was a huge amount of work to make sure yesterday's talks in Saudi Arabia could go as well as possible, and he's extremely pleased about the reinstated US support to Ukraine.

""As ever, we must go further,"" he adds.

The PM was widely considered to have performed well at the White House last month, and even earned plaudits from Conservatives. There was talk of an economic deal, albeit a limited one, and hope that the UK would be exempt from Trump's tariffs.

But with US tariffs on steel and aluminium coming into effect overnight, that hope has proved to be an illusion. 

It's a political vulnerability and here at PMQs, it was just targeted by Lib Dem leader Ed Davey.

Davey asked Starmer whether he'd fly to Canada to show solidarity with the country, after it was hit with US tariffs.

Starmer said the UK would take a pragmatic approach but “keep all options on the table”.

Dealing with Trump is the diplomatic version of treading on eggshells. Labour has tiptoed around the eggshells so far - but will be keen to find firmer footing if the tariffs start to bite.

A question now from Lib Dem leader Ed Davey, who wants to know if Starmer understands that for many disabled people, the best way to get them into work is to support them with more equipment, training, and healthcare.

Starmer responds by saying what the current government has inherited is ""shocking"" - and that ""one in eight young people are not in education, work or training"". He adds that the Tories ""did nothing for 14 years"".

Davey then congratulates Starmer on helping to restore US aid and intelligence-sharing to Ukraine, but asks if the UK should be more robust against Donald Trump's metal tariffs.

Starmer says he's ""disappointed"" by the tariffs on steel and aluminium, but he is negotiating an economic deal with the US. He says he will keep all options on the table.

Watch: Kemi Badenoch focuses on economy at PMQs

Badenoch was laser-focused on the Labour's handling of the economy, in particular the rise in the National Insurance (NIC) rate for employers, which is set to increase from 13.8% to 15% from 6 April 2025.

Badenoch repeatedly called it a “jobs tax”.

Interestingly, she also framed the chancellor's Spring Statement as an “emergency Budget”, given it's expected to include spending cuts.

But Starmer insisted his government was “picking up the mess” left by the Conservatives and pointed to what he called a £22bn “hole” in the public finances.

It's all gone a bit panto in here with the jeering and
cheering.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves shook her head repeatedly when
the Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch described the Spring Statement in a
fortnight as an “emergency Budget.”

Badenoch claimed the government had trashed the “economy
with their bad choices"".

The prime minister responded by pointing to what he saw as
the repeated economic failures of the previous Conservative government.

Badenoch suggests the government is going to bring an ""emergency Budget"" in two weeks, saying Labour will try and make out it's because of global events - but she claims the truth is ""they trashed the economy with their bad choices"".

This is a high-tax, low-growth, job-killing government, she says. 

Starmer responds, saying inflation was 11% under the Conservatives and repeats that they left a £22bn ""black hole"". 

""And they want to give lectures on the economy"", he says, ""no thank you.""

Badenoch next says everyday businesses tell her they're going bust and that supermarket prices are due to go up 4% because of Labour's job tax. 

She continues, saying the budget is also ""killing farming in this country"". 

Responding, Starmer says his government's Budget provided more money for farmers and thousands of farms have benefitted from farming schemes. 

Badenoch says rubbish in Birmingham and Liverpool is piling up, and people are getting ""trash"" - just like ""what he's saying at the dispatch box"".

People all over the country are suffering, she says, adding that care home fees are set to go up by £3,000 because of the government's jobs tax.

How does he expect pensioners to make ends meet, she asks.

Starmer responds by saying the current government is ""picking up and fixing the mess"" that the Conservatives left. 

Back to Badenoch, who says the average council tax bill is going up by more than £100 - on average - in April after he promised to freeze it. 

""Why should these families pay more for less?"", she asks the PM - again focusing her questions on Labour's economic policies. 

Starmer says the Tories put up council tax every year for 12 of the 14 years they were in power.

Watch: Leaders clash over cost of living at PMQs

Badenoch,in turn, says the PM ""needs to get out more"" - and that inflation is up and ""estimates of job losses are between 130,000 and 300,000"".

His tax rises are hurting every sector of the economy, the Tory leader says, adding that nurseries are telling parents that fees are going up. How is more expensive childcare good for the economy or families, she asks.

Starmer says the government is ""putting in childcare"", and talks about bringing in more breakfast clubs. 

She's forgetting the £22bn ""black hole"" left by the Conservatives, he says, claiming Badenoch is attacking Labour measures without saying she would reverse them ""because she wants all the benefits"" but ""doesn't want to pay for it"". 

Keir Starmer responds by paying tribute to David Amess himself, outlining his plans to meet the family later on and ""get answers to questions"" they have.

Onto the Budget end of Badenoch's question, the PM says Labour has secured thousands of new jobs into the economy, that wages are up, that there is more investment and that there has been a boost to the cost of living.

There are cheers from his bench at this point.

Kemi Badenoch kicks off her questioning by highlighting Starmer's upcoming meeting with the family of Davis Amess, a Tory MP who was murdered in 2021.

She asks if Starmer agrees that getting a response to his murder - and how it was allowed to happen - is vital for the UK's democracy.

She then asks the prime minister if he has been given an estimate of how many people will lose their jobs because of his government's Budget.
