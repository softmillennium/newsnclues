The Pakistani government, facing a widening security crisis in the country's restive southwest, has given little indication it intends to negotiate with the militants.

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — A battle between separatist militants and Pakistani soldiers over a hijacked passenger train entered its second day on Wednesday, with dozens of people killed in clashes and an unknown number of passengers still believed to be held hostage by the militants.

Militants belonging to a Baluch separatist group, the Baluchistan Liberation Army, or BLA, stopped and boarded the train, the Jaffar Express, in a mountainous part of Baluchistan province on Tuesday. More than 350 people were believed to be onboard when the train was seized, including about 150 members of the security forces, Pakistani railway officials said.

The BLA initially claimed to have taken about 180 hostages, threatening to kill them if a rescue operation was attempted, while urging Pakistani officials to instead negotiate a prisoner exchange. The group gave the Pakistani government 48 hours to respond; the deadline expires about midday Thursday.

In a statement Wednesday, the group threatened that “with every passing hour after the ultimatum expires, five hostages will be punished” — a phrase widely understood to mean they would be executed. Local Pakistani officials confirmed the group had taken hostages but put their numbers in the low dozens.

After intense clashes overnight, Pakistani officials said Wednesday that 190 people had been freed and 30 militants killed but that the hostage situation remained unresolved.

The Pakistani government, facing a widening security crisis in the country's restive southwest, has taken a hard line and given little public indication it will negotiate. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said Tuesday that the “cowardly terrorists, who carried out this despicable attack, are not deserving of any leniency,” according to the Express Tribune.

Pakistani officials on Wednesday accused the militants of using women and children as human shields on the hijacked train — a claim that the group denied.

Mohammad Ashraf, a passenger who was released, said the militants allowed some of them to leave after separating him, other elderly people, and women and children from the remaining passengers. “It was so quiet — everyone was in fear,” he told Pakistani television crews.

The Jaffar Express left Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan, at about 9 a.m. and was expected to traverse much of Punjab province before arriving in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, more than 30 hours later. It was attacked roughly three to four hours into the trip. Some passengers may have taken the train because, after months of worsening security incidents along Baluchistan's highways, it was seen as the last safe method of transportation.

The train hijacking is a major blow to Pakistan's military and civilian leadership, which are struggling to realize their plans to integrate the volatile southwestern province into Pakistan's trade corridor with China. The deepwater Gwadar port in southern Baluchistan is a key component of that plan.

Militant attacks in that part of Pakistan surged by more than 80 percent last year, killing more than 320 people, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies. Most attacks have been claimed by the BLA and its ideological ally, the Baluchistan Liberation Front.

Their attacks have made parts of the province “ungovernable,” Pakistani security analyst Hasan Askari Rizvi said, adding that Tuesday's train hijacking signals “a grave security challenge for Pakistan.”

Dozens of people were killed in a BLA suicide attack at a Quetta railway station in November, which targeted a group of soldiers.

There are also Baluch communities in neighboring Iran and Afghanistan, and Pakistani officials have frequently accused the BLA and other groups of exploiting porous borders to evade capture and sustain their insurgency.

Analysts warn that Baluchistan's militancy is at least in part fueled by broader and more widely felt grievances over rampant poverty and neglect. The government and its foreign partners are seen by separatists as exploiting the region's vast natural resources with little benefit to local communities.

“A large share of Baluchistan's youths feel alienated, marginalized and excluded from their fair share of the province's economic development,” Rizvi said. “There should be a dialogue to win these people back.”

The BLA has claimed at least 10 attacks on Chinese targets since 2017, including a blast in Karachi in October that killed two Chinese workers.

Baluch militants have also targeted ethnic Punjabi civilians, whom they view as complicit in the government's plans for the region. Officials documented at least 15 attacks against non-Baluch workers, travelers or settlers last year.

The US president is making energy deals with Japan and Ukraine, and in Africa has even touted resurrecting coal

Donald Trump's repeated mantra of “drill, baby, drill” demands that more oil and gas be extracted in the United States, but the president has set his sights on an even broader goal: keeping the world hooked on planet-heating fossil fuels for as long as possible.

In deals being formulated with countries such as Japan and Ukraine, Trump is using US leverage in tariffs and military aid to bolster the flow of oil and gas around the world. In Africa, his administration has even touted the resurrection of coal, the dirtiest of all fossil fuels, to bring energy to the continent.

“We've had years of western countries shamelessly saying: ‘Don't develop coal, coal is bad,'” said Chris Wright, the US energy secretary, last week. Such an attitude has been “paternalistic” and counterproductive for Africa, he added. “That's just nonsense, 100% nonsense,” Wright said. “Coal transformed our world and made it better.”

Wright built on this theme on Monday at the CeraWeek oil industry conference in Houston, Texas, where he said the world needed more, rather than less, fossil fuels. He also attacked Joe Biden for “irrational, quasi-religious policies on climate change” and claimed “there is no physical way” renewables such as solar and wind could replace fossil fuels – a view disputed by experts.

This vision of a world wedded long-term to fossil fuels could spur greater US backing for drilling in Africa, delighting business interests that claim oil and gas are the answer to bringing power to the 600 million people on the continent who lack electricity.

“With President Trump's rollbacks of restrictions, there will be new opportunities for US investors to engage with Africa's oil and gas sector,” said Robert Stryk, chair of Stryk Global Diplomacy, a consultancy helping the African Energy Chamber facilitate US-funded oil and gas projects in Africa. “It has the potential to unlock real benefits for African nations. Secretary Wright made a powerful statement. It was a genius move.”

Stryk said it was “hypocritical” for western countries to demand Africa forgo fossil fuels after powering their own economies on coal, oil and gas. “Let Africa choose its own destiny,” he said. “People talk about renewables, but it's hollow. It just keeps people where they are there, which is in poverty.”

Scientists have made clear that the climate crisis, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, poses catastrophic risks around the world, particularly in poorer African countries that have emitted a small fraction of planet-heating pollution. Africa is heating up faster than the global average and is already suffering from worsening floods, heatwaves and droughts, with countries there losing up to 5% of their gross domestic product (GDP) responding to climate extremes.

“One of the transformations caused by American fossil fuels was destroying our previously well-balanced climate and plunging some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in Africa into a life dealing with extreme weather and lost homes and livelihoods,” said Mohamed Adow, founder and director of Power Shift Africa.

“It's a sign of huge ignorance that the US energy secretary is talking up coal, but it's also obvious lobbying on behalf of the US fossil fuel companies which backs Republican politicians.”

Adow said Africa does require assistance from wealthy countries such as the US to build out renewable energy. However, richer nations have long lagged in providing the required finance and Trump has imposed further cuts, axing an initiative to help shift developing countries to clean energy, halting American aid to countries vulnerable to extreme weather and pulling the US from the Paris climate agreement.

“So they have no moral authority to dictate to Africa on the development approach to pursue,” Adow said of the US. “African leaders must choose a path that helps secure energy access and the economic wellbeing of their people. Exacerbating the climate crisis that their people are suffering from would be the opposite of this and undo the development gains of recent years.”

While the world is shifting towards cleaner forms of power, albeit too slowly to stave off worsening climate impacts, Trump has sought to entrench the status quo of fossil fuels. The president lifted a Biden-era pause on exports of American gas, and Japan and South Korea have expressed interest in investing in an Alaska gas project, in part to avoid the threat of tariffs from Trump.

“Japan will soon begin importing historic new shipments of clean American liquefied natural gas (LNG) in record numbers,” the president said last month. “It'll be record numbers.”

Last month, Shigeru Ishiba, the Japanese prime minister, met with Trump at the White House and announced plans for Japan to import more LNG from Freeport, Texas. Manning Rollerson, an environmental justice activist from Freeport, said the US exporting LNG abroad harms communities like his.

“People are being poisoned,” Rollerson said at a protest outside CeraWeek on Monday. “We got babies being born sick, and our economy is in the tank.”

In 2022, a major explosion and fire occurred at the Freeport LNG natural gas export terminal, causing a temporary shutdown and sending pollutants into the air. This highlighted the dangers of the fuel, Rollerson said.

Before the meeting between Ishiba and Trump, Rollerson travelled to Japan to meet with officials and encourage them not to make a “deal with the devil”.

“I invited the Japanese government to come look at Freeport and see what 57 years of industrial build-out … has done for this city,” he said. “It's not pretty.”

Meanwhile, a deal under negotiation with Ukraine would give the US access to the country's store of minerals, which includes oil and gas but also materials such as graphite, used in batteries. The deal could help reverse a pause Trump has placed on US military support to Ukraine, which has been fighting an invading Russian army since 2022.

Ukraine has, even under Russian bombardment, sought to ramp up its clean energy infrastructure. But the new deal could “reverse these advances, potentially forcing our nation back into fossil fuel dependency and external energy control – a devastating setback for a country that has sacrificed so much for its independence”, said Svitlana Romanko, a Ukrainian environmental lawyer and executive director of Razom We Stand.

“Trump's neocolonial mineral grab would make Ukraine a vassal state and accelerate the climate crisis while doing nothing to protect our sovereignty,” Romanko added. “The only people who win from this proposal are the shareholders of American companies and [Russian president Vladimir] Putin.”

Countries and businesses will continue to recognize the threats posed by the climate crisis, but Trump's slashing of support for renewable energy domestically and immolation of USAid and other internationally focused bodies will hinder efforts to reduce emissions, according to Jonathan Elkind, a global energy expert at Columbia University.

“To a much greater extent than ever before, this Trump team is saying that they have no problems with fossil fuels being a part of the energy mix indefinitely,” Elkind said.

“People around the world need climate solutions, not only people in very poor economies but also in the US. But Donald Trump has made clear he's not going to address this problem on his watch.”

The administration of US president Donald Trump continues to introduce polices that strip the government's support of US science, as Peter Gwynne reports

Two months into Donald Trump's second presidency and many parts of US science – across government, academia, and industry – continue to be hit hard by the new administration's policies. Science-related government agencies are seeing budgets and staff cut, especially in programmes linked to climate change and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is also causing havoc as it seeks to slash spending.

In mid-February, DOGE fired more than 300 employees at the National Nuclear Safety Administration, which is part of the US Department of Energy, many of whom were responsible for reassembling nuclear warheads at the Pantex plant in Texas. A day later, the agency was forced to rescind all but 28 of the sackings amid concerns that their absence could jeopardise national security. 

A judge has also reinstated workers who were laid off at the National Science Foundation (NSF) as well as at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The judge said the government's Office of Personnel Management, which sacked the staff, did not have the authority to do so. However, the NSF rehiring applies mainly to military veterans and staff with disabilities, with the overall workforce down by about 140 people – or roughly 10%.

The NSF has also announced a reduction, the size of which is unknown, in its Research Experiences for Undergraduates programme. Over the last 38 years, the initiative has given thousands of college students – many with backgrounds that are underrepresented in science – the opportunity to carry out original research at  institutions during the summer holidays. NSF staff are also reviewing thousands of grants containing such words as “women” and “diversity”.

NASA, meanwhile, is to shut its office of technology, policy and strategy, along with its chief-scientist office, and the DEI and accessibility branch of its diversity and equal opportunity office. “I know this news is difficult and may affect us all differently,” admitted acting administrator Janet Petro in an all-staff e-mail. Affecting about 20 staff, the move is on top of plans to reduce NASA's overall workforce. Reports also suggest that NASA's science budget could be slashed by as much as 50%.

Hundreds of “probationary employees” have also been sacked by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which provides weather forecasts that are vital for farmers and people in areas threatened by tornadoes and hurricanes. “If there were to be large staffing reductions at NOAA there will be people who die in extreme weather events and weather-related disasters who would not have otherwise,” warns climate scientist Daniel Swain from the University of California, Los Angeles.

In his first cabinet meeting on 26 February, Trump suggested that officials “use scalpels” when trimming their departments' spending and personnel – rather than Musk's figurative chainsaw. But bosses at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) still plan to cut its budget by about two-thirds. “[W]e fear that such cuts would render the agency incapable of protecting Americans from grave threats in our air, water, and land,” wrote former EPA administrators William Reilly, Christine Todd Whitman and Gina McCarthy in the New York Times.

The White House's attack on climate science goes beyond just the EPA. In January, the US Department of Agriculture removed almost all data on climate change from its website. The action resulted in a lawsuit in March from the Northeast Organic Farming Association of New York and two non-profit organizations – the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Working Group. They say that the removal hinders research and “agricultural decisions”.

The Trump administration has also barred NASA's now former chief scientist Katherine Calvin and members of the State Department from travelling to China for a planning meeting of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Meanwhile, in a speech to African energy ministers in Washington on 7 March, US energy secretary Chris Wright claimed that coal has “transformed our world and made it better”, adding that climate change, while real, is not on his list of the world's top 10 problems. “We've had years of Western countries shamelessly saying ‘don't develop coal',” he said. “That's just nonsense.”

US science in chaos as impact of Trump's executive orders sinks in




US science in chaos as impact of Trump's executive orders sinks in

At the National Institutes of Health (NIH), staff are being told to cancel hundreds of research grants that involve DEI and transgender issues. The Trump administration also wants to cut the allowance for indirect costs of NIH's and other agencies' research grants to 15% of research contracts, although a district court judge has put that move on hold pending further legal arguments. On 8 March, the Trump administration also threatened to cancel $400m in funding to Columbia purportedly due to its failure to tackle anti-semitism on the campus.

A Trump policy of removing “undocumented aliens” continues to alarm universities that have overseas students. Some institutions have already advised overseas students against travelling abroad during holidays, in case immigration officers do not let them back in when they return. Others warn that their international students should carry their immigration documents with them at all times. Universities have also started to rein in spending with Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for example, implementing a hiring freeze.

Amid the turmoil, the US scientific community is beginning to fight back. Individual scientists have supported court cases that have overturned sackings at government agencies, while a letter to Congress signed by the Union of Concerned Scientists and 48 scientific societies asserts that the administration has “already caused significant harm to American science”. On 7 March, more than 30 US cities also hosted “Stand Up for Science” rallies attended by thousands of demonstrators.

Elsewhere, a group of government, academic and industry leaders – known collectively as Vision for American Science and Technology – has released a report warning that the US could fall behind China and other competitors in science and technology. Entitled Unleashing American Potential, it calls for increased public and private investment in science to maintain US leadership. “The more dollars we put in from the feds, the more investment comes in from industry, and we get job growth, we get economic success, and we get national security out of it,” notes Sudip Parikh, chief executive of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, who was involved in the report.

Marcia McNutt, president of the National Academy of Sciences, meanwhile, has called on the community to continue to highlight the benefit of science. “We need to underscore the fact that stable federal funding of research is the main mode by which radical new discoveries have come to light – discoveries that have enabled the age of quantum computing and AI and new materials science,” she said. “These are areas that I am sure are very important to this administration as well.”

As President Donald Trump's global steel and aluminum tariffs take effect, the E.U. and Canada are responding with their own levies, including on bourbon and motorcycles.

BRUSSELS — The European Union and Canada hit back Wednesday at President Donald Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs with their own levies, announcing tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of U.S. products, including bourbon and motorcycles, while warning of further retaliation.

The 27-nation E.U. said its two-stage response would target roughly $28 billion in U.S. exports, while Canada announced 25 percent retaliatory tariffs on roughly $20.7 billion ($29.8 billion Canadian dollars) worth of American goods.

The announcement of the European measures came at the same time that Trump's tariffs took effect Wednesday. Canada's announcement came several hours later Wednesday morning.

The U.S. decision to raise tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25 percent is the latest salvo in Trump's campaign to reshape America's trading relationship with the world. European leaders have for months planned to swiftly retaliate, even as they have emphasized that a trade war would hurt both sides and tried to negotiate an off-ramp with the Trump administration.

With a deal still elusive, the E.U. executive branch, the European Commission, said that starting April 1, the bloc will reimpose tariffs dating to Trump's first term. It will then place extra measures targeting more than $19 billion in products by mid-April after consulting with E.U. member states.

“We deeply regret this measure,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement Wednesday, as she and other European officials indicated that they were still ready to negotiate. “Jobs are at stake, prices up, nobody needs that.”

Canadian Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc said the government is following a “dollar for dollar” approach in response to Trump's increased tariffs on steel and aluminum, which could cost Canada significant U.S. sales.

The Canadian tariffs, set to start at 12:01 a.m. Thursday, will hit steel products worth roughly $8.7 billion ($12.6 billion CAD), aluminum products worth $2.08 billion ($3 billion CAD) and $9.85 billion ($14.2 billion CAD) of additional U.S. imports.

LeBlanc said the U.S. tariffs were “inserting disruption and disorder” for consumers in both countries and unfairly targeting Canada's steel and aluminum industry.

During Trump's first term, the E.U. had raised tariffs on a variety of products in response to U.S. measures, which were suspended after negotiations with the Biden administration. The pause will now be allowed to expire April 1, with the higher E.U. levies reinstated.

In Trump's previous term, the E.U. chose tariffs designed for maximum political impact, targeting industries based in the home states of Republican leaders, including bourbon from Kentucky, the state represented by then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The bloc also targeted Harley-Davidson motorcycles and Levi's jeans.

The E.U. said the new U.S. tariffs — which affect products that contain steel and aluminum, such as cookware and window frames — would impact about $28 billion of the bloc's own exports, and that it intended to retaliate proportionately.

Along with reimposing the past tariffs, the E.U. said it would impose levies on more than $19 billion worth of other products. E.U. officials will consult for two weeks to finalize the list, with the aim of imposing the new tariffs by mid-April on proposed goods that included home appliances, beef and poultry.

“We're trying to hit the U.S. in important sectors for them, where it does not cost us much,” said a senior E.U. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to share internal deliberations. Another goal was to prompt American businesses to convey to the Trump administration that “this is a bad idea,” he said.

European leaders have long made clear that they would prefer to negotiate and persuade Trump to forgo tariffs. On Wednesday, officials suggested the new E.U. measures could spur an agreement.

E.U. Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic said Wednesday that disruption from tariffs was “avoidable if the U.S. administration accepts our extended hand and works with us to strike a deal.”

The tariffs come at a difficult time for economies in the E.U., which counts the United States as its largest export market. With key E.U. countries facing sluggish growth, businesses are bracing for the prospect of a protracted trade war. Germany, the leading exporter to the United States, would be particularly vulnerable, with some of the biggest anticipated effects on the car and pharmaceutical industries.

The E.U. has not been completely caught off guard, though. At E.U. headquarters, a group informally dubbed the “Trump task force” has been strategizing for Trump's return since last year and focusing on preparing for trade scenarios.

But E.U. officials have faced difficulties arranging meetings with some of their U.S. counterparts or determining whom to lobby in the administration, given uncertainty about how U.S. decisions are made, diplomats say.

Sefcovic, who recently visited Washington, said this week that the Trump administration “did not seem to be engaging” on offers to negotiate a deal.

“We jointly identified the few areas that would allow us to move forward by fostering a mutual benefit,” Sefcovic told reporters in Brussels. “But in the end, one hand cannot clap.”

The tariffs have also disturbed U.S. trade relations with other countries.

In Brazil, officials reacted with anger at the news of the steel tariffs. The United States is the Brazilian steel sector's largest foreign market. Brazil's steel exports reached 3.4 million tons of slabs in 2024, according to the Brazil Steel Institute.

Speaking at a car factory in southeastern Brazil, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said he wouldn't be intimidated by Trump.

“It doesn't matter if Trump keeps yelling, because I've learned not to be frightened of an ugly face,” Lula said. “Speak calmly with me, speak with respect to me, because I've learned to respect others and want to be respected.”

But on Wednesday, Brazilian Finance Minister Fernando Haddad said his  country was not yet ready to retaliate with its own tariffs. Haddad said that the Brazilian steel sector does not compete with the American steel industry but collaborates with it and that Brazil will try to negotiate a way out of the impasse.

Haddad said Lula asked for officials to keep a cool head and not overreact.

Testimony comes during combative day of cross-examination which also highlighted messages involving Prince Andrew

The former chief executive of Barclays, Jes Staley, has admitted to having sex with a member of Jeffery Epstein's staff in an apartment owned by the child sex offender's brother in New York, a court has heard.

Staley made the admission at the end of a testy day of cross-examination at the upper tribunal, but maintained that his friendship with Epstein was not personal, and had always been based on business.

The former Barclays boss, who resigned in 2021, is trying to overturn the regulator's decision to ban him from taking any senior roles in the UK financial sector for allegedly lying about the depth of his relationship with Epstein. Barclays declared to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in a letter in 2019 that the two men “did not have a close relationship”.

The FCA's lawyer Leigh-Ann Mulcahy KC handed documents to Staley and tribunal judges without presenting them to the public, before asking Staley: “Do you accept that you had sexual intercourse with a woman at Mr Epstein's brother's apartment?”

“Yes,” Staley said. The former CEO, who is married and has two daughters, acknowledged he met the woman through Epstein, but while he told the court “she was part of his staff”, he claimed Epstein did not know they had sex.

“How did it come about that you had sexual intercourse with a woman who worked for him at an apartment, owned by his brother, without him knowing?” Mulcahy asked.

Staley explained that, “oftentimes I would go to Epstein's apartment and he would be late, and she and I got the chance to know each other.” This led to sexual intercourse, he said, “much to my embarrassment today”.

The ex-banker agreed with Mulcahy that he would describe the intercourse as “consensual”. The date of the encounter and the age of the woman were not disclosed in court. The FCA stated that the property was owned by Epstein's brother.

Mulcahy also put to Staley that the staff member “appeared to have carved you out of a settlement with the Epstein estate”. Staley replied he was “not aware of that”.

The ex-Barclays boss also maintained that he did not remember the context for a separate, and now notorious, exchange with Epstein in 2010 referring to Disney princesses.

The set of emails, the FCA said, included Staley saying “maybe they're tracking you,” later followed by another email to Epstein, saying: “That was fun. Say hi to Snow White.” “What character would you like next?” Epstein asks, to which Staley replies: “Beauty and the Beast.” Epstein responded: “well one side is availble [sic].

Mulcahy noted that Staley had failed to provide any explanation for the emails in two interviews by the FCA, as well as a US deposition. “You've had a lot of time to consider this email … are you able now to explain?” “No,” Staley said.

It rounded off a combative day of at the tribunal, which marked Staley's third day in the witness box. It involved discussions about how Epstein supported Staley's daughter's academic career, as well as how the late financier described Staley as “like family” to high-profile contacts, including Prince Andrew.

One message, sent by Epstein to Prince Andrew in May 2010, said: “I know you are seeing Jes Staley this morning, he is like family and can be trusted 100%.” Andrew has faced fierce criticism over his ties to Epstein, who died in August 2019 while awaiting trial over charges on trafficking underage girls for sex.

Mulcahy put to Staley that it was unrealistic that Epstein “would tell multiple people that you were a close friend and like a brother if you weren't that close”. However, Staley denied this, saying that he believed Epstein “would willingly mislead and lie about our relationship”.

Weeks later, in June 2010, Staley emailed Epstein to say: “Andrew just sat next to me at dinner. Any word on M? This is fun.” Staley speculated in the hearing that this was likely another reference to the prince, and that “M” likely referred to the former business secretary Lord Mandelson.

Staley went on to ask Epstein that same day: “is she free tonight?” Staley told the court he did not remember who “she” might be.

Mulcahy said Staley's “lack of recollection seems surprising”.

Staley appeared angry and agitated as attention turned to Epstein's relationship with Staley's daughter, particularly after the FCA showed emails suggesting the financier had been “pulling strings” to support her through her academic career and PhD.

Staley twice asked the judge for a break – though retracted the first of those requests – and said that the FCA's line of questioning was “completely unnecessary”, adding that his daughter “accomplished what she did … on the back of her own skill”.

Mulcahy said: “You're the one that said your relationship was professional and based on the assistance to your daughter … I need to explore it to get to the connection of you and Mr Epstein.”

The former Barclays boss will continue giving evidence until the end of the hearing, which is scheduled to last until Friday.

Former Philippine president expected in court within days as daughter accuses Manila government of ‘kidnapping'

Rodrigo Duterte has landed in the Netherlands and been taken into the custody of the international criminal court (ICC) on allegations of overseeing death squads in his bloody “war on drugs”.

The former president of the Philippines was arrested in Manila on Tuesday and placed on a private jet to Rotterdam by police. The plane landed on Wednesday afternoon and taxied into a hangar. An ambulance dropped medics nearby before they wheeled a gurney inside the aircraft.

The ICC later released a statement saying Duterte had been “surrendered to the custody” of the court. It added that “as a precautionary measure, medical assistance” was made available for him at the airport, in line with standard procedures when a suspect arrives.

Nicknamed “the Punisher” in the Philippines for his lethal approach to policing, Duterte, 79, is expected to be taken to an ICC detention unit and then brought before a judge for his initial court appearance in the coming days.

During his years in office, Duterte oversaw a crackdown on accused drug dealers and drug addicts in which as many as 30,000 civilians were killed, usually by police and vigilantes. He is the first former leader of an Asian country to be served an arrest warrant filed by the ICC.

Lawyers for Duterte filed a petition on behalf of his youngest daughter, Veronica, accusing the government of “kidnapping” him, and demanding it bring him back.

Duterte's eldest daughter, Sara, the country's vice-president, left for Amsterdam on Wednesday morning to help with his legal preparations.

Carlos Conde, a senior researcher at the Asia division of Human Rights Watch, said the developments were historic, and that it would be an understatement to say that victims felt ecstatic at his arrest. “This is something that's totally unprecedented in the history of this country … not just in this country, [but] for south-east Asia and even Asia,” he said.

“[Victims'] spirits are buoyed. They're very, very optimistic that this is something that can move along expeditiously in The Hague,” Conde said. “The victims here in the Philippines have pretty much lost faith in the domestic justice system, which has done so very little in terms of addressing their quest for justice. This is why they pinned their hopes on the ICC.”

Building the case had been a “very painstaking process” for victims, the families of victims and domestic human rights groups, Conde added.

The timeline for a trial is unclear, but campaigners have called for proceedings to begin swiftly.

The National Union of Peoples' Lawyers, which has represented the families of victims of the killings, said “victims' pain from loss” had been, for the day, “eclipsed by joy and hope”.

Duterte's arrest was symbolic of “a victory of the poor and marginalised, akin to that of David versus Goliath,” the lawyers' group said, adding: “We still have to press on and work for his eventual conviction.”

“There's a feeling of simple joy at what is happening, and relief,” said Brother Jun Santiago, who set up Silingan Coffee, a small coffee shop, to help give jobs to the families of victims of extrajudicial killings, and to provide a space to memorialise their stories.

On Tuesday, the cafe offered discounted drinks to customers to encourage people to visit and learn about the abuses that were committed under Duterte's government. Santiago described the arrest as a “first step to justice”.

Duterte's arrest was widely celebrated among human rights groups, with the Philippine rights alliance Karapatan describing the development as “long overdue”.

Duterte's supporters have argued that, as the Philippines withdrew from the Rome statute in 2019, the ICC no longer has jurisdiction. However, the court has previously said it retains jurisdiction for alleged crimes that occurred in the country before its withdrawal.

The official Facebook page of the vice-president's office shared an image of a red ribbon with the text “BRING PRRD HOME” – referring to President Rodrigo Roa Duterte.

The country's president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, told reporters on Tuesday night that he was confident “the arrest was proper, correct and followed all necessary legal procedures”. He added: “We did not help the international criminal court in any way. The arrest was made in compliance with Interpol.”

US President Donald Trump said Wednesday that negotiators were headed to Russia "right now" for talks on a possible ceasefire with Ukraine, after Kyiv agreed to a 30-day truce.

Trump did not give further details on the negotiating team.

"People are going to Russia right now as we speak. And hopefully we can get a ceasefire from Russia," Trump told reporters in the Oval Office during a meeting with Ireland's prime minister.

"And if we do, I think that would be 80 percent of the way to getting this horrible bloodbath finished."

Vice President JD Vance, who was also in the meeting, added that there were "conversations that are happening on the phone and in person with some of our representatives over the next couple of days."

Trump would not say when he would next speak to his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, but added that "I hope he's going to have a ceasefire" and that there had been "positive messages" from Moscow.

"It's up to Russia now," said Trump.

Trump was coy about pressuring Moscow to agree to a truce, saying he could slap it with "devastating" sanctions but adding that "I hope that's not going to be necessary."

"I can do things financially that would be very bad for Russia. I don't want to do that because I want to get peace," Trump added.

His comments come less than two weeks after an explosive row between Trump, Vance and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office in front of television cameras.

Trump halted military aid after the argument to pressure Kyiv, which agreed to a US-proposed plan for a 30-day ceasefire at talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday.

Canadian government says it will follow ‘dollar-by-dollar' approach and institute 25% tariffs on US imports

Canada announced retaliatory tariffs on nearly $30bn worth of American imports after US tariffs on steel and aluminum imports went into effect on Wednesday.

The Canadian government said it will be following a “dollar-by-dollar” approach and institute 25% tariffs on American imports, including steel, computers and sports equipment.

Donald Trump first announced the tariff on all steel and aluminum imports in February and scheduled them to go into effect on Wednesday. The tariffs going into effect has started a chain reaction of retaliatory tariffs as countries around the world decide how to respond to Trump's policy.

Canada's announcement comes after the EU announced its own tariffs on American imports, including products such as motorcycles and whiskey, totaling $28bn.

Trump had doubled the steel and aluminum tariffs against Canada, in retaliation for Canada raising the prices on electricity exports to the US, to 50%. But the White House dropped the measure after Canada said it will hold off on its electricity tariff.

Meanwhile, the Mexican president, Claudia Sheinbaum, said the country would wait until 2 April to determine whether it will respond to the steel and aluminum tariffs.

Canadian and EU leaders voiced regret over the impact the tariffs will have on domestic businesses, but argued countries need to respond appropriately to Trump's actions

Mélanie Joly, the country's minister of foreign affairs, said in a press conference on Wednesday that the country will “not back down and we will not give into this coercion”, denouncing the chaos Trump has ensued on the global economy.

“The only constant in this unjustified and unjustifiable trade war seems to be President Trump's talks of annexing our country's through economic coercion,” Joly told a press conference.

Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said that the steel and aluminum tariffs were “unjustified trade restrictions”. “Tariffs are taxes, they are bad for business and worse for consumers. They are disrupting supply chains. They bring uncertainty for the economy,” she said.

Despite the criticism from global leaders, Trump defended the tariffs after meeting with the Business Roundtable, a group of key US business leaders on Tuesday. “Markets are going to go up and they're going to go down, but you know what? We have to rebuild our country,” Trump said on Tuesday.

After a week-long slump, US markets started making small gains on Tuesday morning after inflation figures that were better than projected.

Michelle Obama jokingly chastised her husband, Barack Obama, on her new podcast with her elder brother, Craig Robinson.

Higher Ground, the media group founder by former President Obama and his wife, on Monday, launched “IMO with Michelle Obama & Craig Robinson”. Wednesday saw the release of the first two episodes, which included an introduction and an interview with actress Issa Rae.

In her first episode, Michelle, 61, complained that Barack Obama, 63, had a terrible habit of arriving late.

“I got this husband who's like, when it's time to leave, it's three o'clock, he's getting up and going to the bathroom!” the author of Becoming stated, as per Newsweek. “And I was like, 'Dude, dude, like three o'clock departure means you've done all that,' you know? It's like, don't start looking for your glasses, you know, at the three o'clock departure.”

She further noted that Obama has “improved” over 30 years of their marriage.

The mother of two, who is parent to Malia and Sasha, said she taught her girls to be on time.

“If they're doing anything with me, they are early, so they've learned how to snap to it.”

The former First Lady has hosted Michelle Obama Podcast before. According to her website bio, it “was the most successful original in Spotify history, bringing in more women listeners over 40 than any other podcast” when it was first released in 2020.

Taking to Instagram, Michelle shared her reasons for wanting to launch a podcast in 2025.

Stressing that a lot is happening in the world at the moment, she told her 56.8 million followers, “We're living through some really complicated and confusing times, and on top of that, folks are trying to juggle family life, work dynamics, relationships, aging parents, and more.”

She hailed Craig as one of the individuals who never fails to provide her with the comedy, knowledge, and insights that she needs to get through any situation. “Together, we'll share our perspectives about some of your questions. And we won't be doing it alone. We'll be joined by special guests, friends, and experts along the way.”

She further ensured that she will tell truth and discuss a wide range of perspectives. “A lot of learning. And plenty of laughs. We all need some moments of light right now.”

New episodes of IMO featuring Michelle Obama and Craig Robinson will be made accessible every week on Spotify, YouTube and Apple Podcasts.

ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistan's neglected southwestern province of Balochistan has been the scene of a yearslong insurgency, with a dramatic uptick in attacks in recent years underscoring the struggles the government in Islamabad faces in dealing with myriad security threats. 

The seizure Tuesday of a passenger train by the outlawed Baluch Liberation Army, or BLA, took the insurgency to a new level with the first such large-scale operation by the militant group. 

The militants took hundreds of passengers aboard the Jafer Express hostage before Pakistani forces said Wednesday that they had killed all 50 of the attackers. The military said the assailants killed 21 passengers, and that all the remaining passengers were rescued.

Balochistan is Pakistan's largest province and the country's least populated. It's also a hub for the country's ethnic Baloch minority, whose members say they face discrimination by the government.

The separatists have fought since the early 2000s for autonomy — if not outright independence — from Islamabad and for a greater share of natural resources that the undeveloped province abounds in, such as natural gas, oil and minerals.

Over the years, the BLA has grown in strength, prompting some analysts to say the group today compares to the Pakistani Taliban in terms of the threat it poses for the country.

The BLA has regularly targeted Pakistani security forces and has also in the past attacked civilians, including Chinese nationals working on multibillion-dollar projects related to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. It has also staged attacks beyond Balochistan, including in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city.

Although the government insists it has significantly curbed violence, attacks in Balochistan have not abated. Islamic militant groups also operate in the province.

The BLA, which both Pakistan and the United States have designated a terrorist organization, is estimated to have around 3,000 fighters, promptly claimed responsibility for the attack on Tuesday. 

The group seeks to establish an independent Baloch state, encompassing territories in Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan where the Baloch ethnic group lives. 

Islamabad maintains that the BLA is getting support from neighboring India, a rival and like Pakistan, a nuclear-armed nation — though New Delhi has dismissed the allegation. The Pakistani government also claims that there is a degree of cooperation between the BLA and the country's top militant group, the Pakistani Taliban.

Analysts say the BLA has grown more emboldened since the Pakistani Taliban ended a cease-fire with the government in November 2022, encouraging more militant attacks across the country. 

Separately from the rivalry with India, Pakistan has also had a tense relationship with neighboring Iran, contributing to the insecurity in Baluchistan. 

The two countries share a 900-kilometer (560-mile) border, which remains largely ungoverned, allowing smugglers and militant groups to move about freely. Both governments accuse each other of harboring or tolerating insurgent groups.

Economic factors also drive the unrest, said Khan, the analyst, adding that it does not bode well for Pakistan's economy. 

“Who will come and invest in Pakistan if we keep seeing such attacks,” he said. 

Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative has poured billions of dollars into Pakistan but it has also alienated the Baloch minority further. They say Islamabad is exploiting Balochistan's resources while neglecting the local communities. 

However, Syed Muhammad Ali, a security analyst, said that while the train attack may have provided the BLA with “instant public and media attention,” the civilian deaths from the attack will likely “weaken their support base” among the province's population.

The Pakistan Army on Wednesday said that the hijack of the Jaffar Express had ended, with 21 passengers and four paramilitary Frontier Corps soldiers killed by Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) militants who had taken control of the train. 

Army spokesperson Lieutenant General Ahmad Sharif told Pakistani media outlet Dunya News TV that all 33 militants present at the attack site had been killed. 

"The armed forces successfully concluded the operation in the (Wednesday) evening by killing all terrorists and rescuing all passengers safely,” Sharif said.

The Jaffar Express, carrying some 400 passengers in nine coaches, was going from Quetta to Peshawar when BLA militants derailed it using explosives and hijacked it near the mountainous terrain of Gudalar and Piru Kunri in a tunnel 160 kilometres from Quetta.

The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the attack on Tuesday when they said they killed six soldiers.

However, an Army official told AFP that 27 off-duty soldiers who were passengers on the train were killed.

"346 hostages were freed and over 30 terrorists were killed during the operation," an army official told AFP, adding that 27 off-duty soldiers who were passengers on the train were killed by militants, and one soldier killed during the operation," the official said.

Pakistan prime minister Shehbaz Sharif posted on X,"Spoke with Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti who briefed me on the latest developments in the heinous terrorist attack on Jaffar Express. The entire nation is deeply shocked by this dastardly act and saddened by the loss of innocent lives—such cowardly acts will not shake Pakistan's resolve for peace."

“I offer my heartfelt condolences to the families of the martyrs. May Allah grant them the highest ranks in Jannah and bless those injured with a swift recovery. Dozens of the terrorists have been sent to hell,” Sharif added.

This is the first time the BLA or any insurgent group in the Balochistan province have resorted to hijacking a passenger train, although since last year, they have stepped up their attacks on security forces, installations and foreigners in different parts of the province.

In the past, the railway tracks in this area have been attacked by Baloch militants using rockets or remote-controlled bombs, and the BLA claimed responsibility for most of the attacks.

Over the past week, Panama's government has released dozens of migrants from around the world who were deported from the U.S. The migrants fled conflict, religious persecution, poverty and government crackdowns in countries such as Afghanistan, Somalia, Cameroon, China, Pakistan and Iran

PANAMA CITY (AP) — They crossed oceans to get to the U.S., fleeing conflict, religious persecution, poverty and government crackdowns in countries such as Afghanistan, Somalia, Cameroon, China, Pakistan and Iran.

After flying to Central and South America, they bused through countries where they didn't speak the language and walked through unfamiliar jungle to get to the U.S.-Mexico border.

Within days, they were detained and put on military aircraft that flew nearly 300 of them to Panama as U.S. President Donald Trump sought to accelerate deportations to more complicated destinations.

Panama was supposed to be a stopover. But for those unwilling to return home — mostly out of well-founded fear — Panama sent them to a guarded camp without access to lawyers in the same Darién jungle many had crossed months earlier on their way north.

Over the past week, under legal pressure, the Panamanian government dropped them off at a bus station in the capital with 30 days to figure out where they will go next. 

“It feels like the whole world is crushing down on me. It's like everything is stopping,” said Isha Len, a 29-year-old from Cameroon. “I risked everything, my life, everything, crossing the Darién Gap, just to be sent back.”

Here are the stories that some of the deportees told The Associated Press:



  Isha Len, 29, Cameroon 
 

After conflict broke out in her small town, Len crossed Cameroon by car and minibus, then a fisherman friend carried her four hours by boat to Nigeria. 

Len, a schoolteacher, flew to Sao Paulo, Brazil, where she said authorities detained her for a month in the airport. From there, she wound north through South America by bus, following other migrants until they reached the Darién Gap.

She walked days through the dangerous jungle that divides Colombia and Panama before boarding buses that carried her through Central America. After being kidnapped for days by a gang in Guatemala, she crossed into southern Mexico, where she took a boat along the Pacific coast to evade authorities. After she landed, she rode eight hours to Mexico City, continuing on by bus and car to Tijuana. 

She crossed the U.S. border and presented herself to American authorities.



  Artemis Ghasemzadeh, 27, Iran 
 

Artemis Ghasemzadeh left her country in January, fleeing after converting from Islam to Christianity – something that could cost Ghasemzadeh her life in Iran. She flew to Dubai, where she stayed two weeks and then took a flight to South Korea. 

From there she flew to Mexico City, staying there for three weeks before going to Tijuana. She crossed the U.S. border on Feb. 9, and was detained for five days, including her birthday.

“For changing your religion, your punishment is death," she said. “We don't know what will happen."



  Wang Qiu, 53, China
 

Wang Qiu said he left home after he was imprisoned for three years for speaking out about democracy and human rights issues. 

He flew from Beijing to Cuba, then to the small South American country of Suriname. From there, he traveled by land: through Guyana, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia, before trekking through the Darién Gap. 

He moved up through Central America and Mexico before being detained after crossing into the U.S. in San Diego.



  Qamar Abdi, 19, Somalia
 

Qamar Abdi, left for the U.S. on Aug. 17, due to warfare between the government and militants of al-Shabab, which the U.S. recognizes as a terrorist group. 

She hopped from buses to shared cars for nearly a month until she reached South Africa. From there, she flew to Sao Paulo, Brazil, and spent the next six months riding buses north. 

When she arrived at the northern tip of Colombia, she traveled six days through the Darién Gap, landing in Panama on New Year's Day. 

She took buses to the southern Mexican border city of Tapachula, where she was temporarily kidnapped and robbed by a gang. To avoid immigration authorities, she traveled hours packed on a boat with other migrants along Mexico's Pacific coast, then took a bus to Mexico City. She spent two weeks there before driving to Tijuana, where she crossed into the U.S.



  Ebrahim Ghezelgechi, 36, Iran
 

Ebrahim Ghezelgechi fled Iran with his wife, Sahar; 10-year-old daughter, Aylin; and 11-year-old son, Sam, on Nov. 21. 

The family flew to Brazil, then to Panama and finally Nicaragua. From there, they took buses north to Guatemala, then crossed into southern Mexico by boat. They road on top of trains and in buses and vans to get to Tijuana. 

After Mexico authorities sent them back to the southern part of the country, they took a plane to the resort area of Los Cabos. There, they were detained, had their passports taken and were sent back south again. 

They tried getting north a number of times, punted back by Mexican authorities, before eventually paying a driver to take them to Tijuana. 

After crossing into the U.S., they were detained in San Diego for a week.



  Samin Haider, 21, Pakistan
 

Samin Haider left for Dubai in 2023 after violence surged in his region of Parachinar, which borders Afghanistan and has been plagued for decades by conflicts between Shi'ite and Sunni Muslim communities. 

Haider was there for 1 1/2 years before the United Arab Emirates canceled visas for Pakistanis. 

Haider then flew to Mexico and traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border with the hopes of seeking asylum. 

Now deported to Panama, he still hopes to reach the U.S.



  Elham Ghaedi, 29, Iran 
 

Elham Ghaedi left on Oct. 21, flying to Brazil and then to Venezuela's capital Caracas. 

She traveled to Colombia, where took a bus north and then walked five days through the Darién Gap. 

She stayed 15 days in a migrant camp in southern Panama before taking a bus through Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and to Mexico's southern border. There, migration authorities detained her for six days.

She traveled north to Mexico City, where she spent a month, before boarding a flight to Tijuana. U.S. authorities detained her when she crossed to San Diego.



  Hayatullah Omagh, 29, Afghanistan
 

Omagh fled Afghanistan in 2022 after the takeover of the Taliban because he identified as an atheist and was part of an ethnic minority, something that could put his life in danger. 

He first went to Pakistan, where he got a visa for six months, and struggled to get a new one due to his Afghani passport. 

He then went to Iran and worked there for 1 1/2 years. But the country wouldn't accept him as a refugee. 

He managed to get a visa to Brazil, which offered a number of Afghan people refuge after the rise of the Taliban, and flew to Sao Paulo in 2024.

Hoping to reunite with friends and family in the U.S., Omagh paid smugglers to move him north through Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia. He trekked through the Darién Gap, then took buses north through Central America to southern Mexico. 

Mexican authorities detained him and dropped him back in southern Mexico a few times before he managed to take a flight to Mexico City and later to the U.S., where he was detained. 

“After so much time, I've lost hope,” he said.

        As pressure mounts on Ahmed al-Sharaa's government following massacres over the weekend, Syrian authorities announce the formation of a national investigation committee. However, the international community remains sceptical about its independence.
    

As pressure mounts on Ahmed al-Sharaa's government following massacres over the weekend, Syrian authorities announce the formation of a national investigation committee. However, the international community remains sceptical about its independence.

In response to the reportedly violent repression of an uprising on the Syrian coast and in anticipation of the possible increase of Western sanctions against his country, interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa confirmed in a recent interview that sanctions already imposed on Syria are hindering his government's ability to restore stability and security.

The interim Syrian leader added that the escalation of violence in his country is linked to attacks behind the loyalists of the Bashar al-Assad regime and a foreign state, without providing supporting evidence.

Syrian authorities have announced a committee to investigate and hold accountable those involved in the violence against Alawites and minorities in the coast. 

On the formation of this body, al-Sharaa stressed that those involved will be brought to justice "even if they are close to us," before highlighting his government's commitment to achieving justice and not allowing the current situation to turn into "an opportunity for revenge" for past grievances.

However, the Syrian president also refused to disclose the identity of those involved in the recent killings, saying only that the security authorities are working to uncover the truth and bring those responsible to justice.

His recent comments are a far cry from his rhetoric of pursuing "remnants of the al-Assad regime" when violence broke out last Thursday. 

This seismic shift begs the question of whether this a genuine commitment to the pursuit of justice, or just a ploy to stop further sanctions?

At the end of the first week of March, Syria's two coastal governorates of Latakia and Tartus witnessed horrific violence that resulted in over 1,000 deaths, including a large number of civilians, according to the independent UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. 

Initially, Syrian authorities focused on "eliminating armed groups affiliated with the former regime." 

In an official statement, al-Sharaa asserted that the security forces were "fighting a necessary battle against al-Assad's remnants who seek to destabilise the country." 

However, field reports published by human rights organisations and international media gave a different account, describing "sectarian cleansing massacres" and confirming "mass executions and forced displacement of Alawite civilians," a minority ethnic group making up around 15% of Syria's population. 

Syria's former rulers, Bashar al-Assad and his father Hafez both hail from the group, which has led to accusations of “revenge killings,” after al-Sharaa and his Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group toppled the al-Assad regime in December 2024.

The violence in early March suggests the honeymoon period for the new authorities has worn off, as Syria enters a critical phase of renewed challenges to governmental authority with the potential for unrest to boil over.

What happened along Syria's Mediterranean coast has turned into a political and humanitarian crisis, sparking widespread international criticism, especially after reports, videos and live testimonies of dozens of massacres against Alawite civilians spread across the internet.

Some of those most openly pressuring the al-Sharaa government to take concrete steps to ensure there is no impunity for perpetrators of the violence are the EU and US.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the events as "a massacre that cannot be condoned," calling for "an independent international investigation to identify those responsible for these crimes". 

Washington also warned that "any failure to achieve justice could expose the Syrian government to US sanctions".

For its part, the European Union issued a strongly worded statement emphasising that "failure to hold the perpetrators of the massacres accountable will lead to the suspension of political and economic support to the new government."

Germany and France — of which the latter invited al-Sharaa for an official visit when he rose to power in December — also demanded the inclusion of international observers in any investigation committee to ensure its transparency, which was echoed by UN Secretary General António Guterres.

There is evidence that this criticism — especially from Western governments weighing up sanctions — has pressured al-Sharaa and his government into launching an investigation, which observers hope will be independent and transparent.

However, this has led some to view the move as "more a response to pressure than a real commitment to accountability," especially as al-Sharaa concurrently tries to dodge internal accusations of being subservient to international demands.

When launching the initiative, al-Sharaa announced his government "will not relent in holding accountable anyone proven to be involved in crimes against civilians".

However, this was met with skepticism by international and human rights groups with some accusing it of being a cynical measure to absorb international outrage without actually holding those involved accountable.

Although tentatively welcoming the announcement, the US State Department stressed that it will "closely monitor the implementation of the commission's work and its findings," while French and German authorities claimed, "the Syrian transitional government has a direct interest in exonerating certain actors".

At the same time, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International expressed serious doubts about the commission's ability to work freely, stating that it "lacks impartiality, as it includes figures close to the security services."

Not everyone was so pessimistic: Moscow and Beijing welcomed the formation of the committee, arguing that "Syria is capable of investigating the events without outside interference," further dividing international positions on the issue.

As the debate over the integrity of the investigation continues, al-Sharaa faces the real threat of greater international isolation of his transitional government, at a time when the economy remains dangerously weak and when 90% of the population live below the poverty line.

Yet he also has to please a panoply of conflicting internal alliances, many of whom have roots in Western-proscribed terrorist organisations — which the EU, US and UN considered HTS to be until December — who refuse to as they see it capitulate to Western powers. 

This leaves the interim leader with few options. He could proceed with the internal committee without international oversight, which may increase international scepticism and expose Syria to greater political and economic pressure externally, but satiate some internal groups.

On the other hand, al-Sharaa could agree to involve UN monitors, which would help it gain international legitimacy, but open the door to internal criticism from hardliners in the government. 

There is also the option to simply do as little as possible: procrastinating on providing tangible results, hoping that international interest in the issue will wane over time. It could play in his favour, but is a risky strategy which could equally anger all sides.

In many ways, al-Sharaa's response to recent unrest reflects a common problem for governments born out of uprising and revolutions, the tension of trying to court skeptical global powers, while concurrently trying to combat internal factionalism.

As much as the EU, the US and allies want immediate results, the current situation has thrown up more questions than answers. 

Meanwhile, al-Sharaa has reached a point where he will need to prove he is serious about fulfilling his promises to gain the trust of the international community, or Syria will find itself facing increasing isolation, analysts believe.

        Yemen's Houthi rebels, seeking to halt Israel's attacks on the Gaza Strip, have repeatedly targeted vessels in the Red Sea.
    

Yemen's Houthi rebels warned on Wednesday that “any Israeli vessel” passing through nearby waters would now be a target for attacks should Israel not lift its blockade of food and aid to the Gaza Strip. 

Their statement, from the Houthis' Humanitarian Operations Coordination Centre, said that the actions taken by the Houthi military aimed to "pressure the Israeli usurper entity to reopen the crossings to the Gaza Strip and allow the entry of aid, including food and medical supplies.” 

It added the group's actions stemmed from a "deep sense" of responsibility toward the Palestinian people.

The Houthis, seeking to stop Israel's offensive in Gaza, have repeatedly attacked cargo ships in the waters connecting Asia with Europe and the US. 

The rebels have previously adopted a broad definition of Israeli-linked ships, raising concerns that other vessels may also be targeted in the process. 

The group specified that the warning applies to ships in the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, and the Arabian Sea, adding: “Any Israeli vessel attempting to violate this ban will be subject to military targeting in the declared operational area.”

Despite the announcement, there was no immediate sign of an attack on vessels.

The Houthi warning comes after Israel suspended all aid deliveries to Gaza this month, in an effort to pressure Hamas into releasing the remaining Israeli hostages held in the territory. 

The move has drawn strong international criticism, as Gaza's over 2 million residents were already heavily reliant on international aid before the war, a dependence that has only intensified following Israel's military offensive.

Maritime security firm Ambrey cautioned that the Houthis' vague wording could place more ships at risk, stating that the threat “likely extends to ships partially owned, managed, or operated by Israeli individuals or entities, vessels heading to Israel and to ships of companies that call Israel.”

Although the statement did not contain a direct threat against the US Navy, previous Houthi operations have targeted American and Western warships, leading to some of the most intense naval combat seen since World War II.

US military officials said in a statement on Wednesday that they “remain vigilant”. “We will do what is necessary to protect and defend US personnel, assets, and partners,” they added. 

The latest warning follows an ultimatum issued by Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi last Friday, who vowed to resume attacks on Israeli-linked vessels unless Israel resumed aid deliveries to Gaza within four days. That deadline expired on Tuesday.

From November 2023 to January 2024, the Houthis attacked over 100 commercial vessels using missiles and drones, sinking two ships and killing four sailors.

These assaults have significantly raised the Houthis' profile, even as they face economic struggles and continue a crackdown on dissent and aid workers amid Yemen's decade-long war.

Donald Trump has said "it's up to Russia now" as he urged Vladimir Putin to agree to a 30-day ceasefire with Ukraine. Earlier, the Kremlin said it was studying the proposal but would not agree to anything until it had heard from the US. Follow the latest here.

Live reporting by Adam McGroarty

Vladimir Putin will look to respond with a demand of his own to the ceasefire proposal, his former adviser has said.

Speaking to our chief presenter Mark Austin, Sergei Markov said: "Russia is afraid that the ceasefire period would be used by NATO countries for the full militarisation of the Ukrainian society."

He said Putin will therefore likely demand a weapon embargo for the supplying of the Ukrainian army from other countries.

But when asked about the prospect of peacekeeping forces being planned by European countries, Markov began to laugh at the idea.

He claimed British and French troops are "part of the war" and said peacekeepers are usually from neutral countries.

"All troops from European countries would be regarded as occupation troops, and all of them would be killed by Russian soldiers who would come to liberate Ukraine," Markov said.

But things got heated when he was pushed as to whether Russia would treat UK peacekeeping soldiers as the enemy and participants of the war.

"Yes, because Britain is a participant of the war," Markov said - referencing the military aid given to Ukraine by the UK.

With Donald Trump confirming a US delegation is travelling to Russia (see 4.17pm post), we have now heard that his national security adviser Mike Waltz spoke to his Russian counterpart today.  

Waltz was at the Saudi talks with Ukrainian officials yesterday.

It comes after Russia said it would not decide on the US-proposed Ukraine ceasefire until it hears from the Americans (see 9.49am post).

The defence ministers of France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the UK are meeting in Paris to discuss support for Ukraine - and they're holding a news conference now.

French defence minister Sebastien Lecornu has said around 15 countries have expressed an interest in discussing security for Ukraine.

Meanwhile, German defence minister Boris Pistorius called for long-term peace as he said the ceasefire was the right step to take.

Watch the news conference in the stream below.

For weeks it seemed like Vladimir Putin had Donald Trump's ear, but all of a sudden he's now on the end of the US president's demands, our Moscow correspondent Ivor Bennett says.

Trump is already applying pressure on Moscow to agree to the 30-day ceasefire proposal, Bennett says, noting Trump's comments about things in a "financial sense" that could be "very bad for Russia" - comments that imply a fresh round of sanctions could be on the way.

Turning to Steve Witkoff's widely anticipated visit to Moscow this week, Bennett says Trump's Middle East envoy will present the US ceasefire proposal to Putin, but questions whether he will be successful.

"It's a difficult one to call because, as we know, Russia doesn't like to be put into a corner or have decisions made for it. 

"But at the same time, I don't think Putin wants to jeopardise relations with the US. So a lot for him to think about."

More to bring you now from Donald Trump - who has continued to address the US proposal of a 30-day ceasefire after welcoming the world's media into the Oval Office.

The US president says "we have a very complex situation solved on one side, pretty much solved" after talks with Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia yesterday.

He says "we've discussed a lot of the details" including the areas of land involved in the proposed deal, but insists "we don't want to be wasting time".

"People are dying... as we're sitting here, you probably had two people die on that very open field, it's dead flat, great farmland and it's dead flat," he adds.

"There's no protection, the only thing that stops a bullet is a human body and these bodies are young people."

Trump describes the situation as a "disaster" and says "I hope he [Putin] is going to have a ceasefire".

Sitting in front of the cameras in the Oval Office just now, Donald Trump said "we have people going to Russia right now".

Only one man has been trusted to head up his envoy to Moscow, and he's far from the typical diplomat.

Initially named as Trump's Middle East envoy shortly after the US election, Steve Witkoff has since been involved in negotiations with Russia about ending the war in Ukraine.

His surprise trip to Moscow last month to achieve the release of US citizen Marc Fogel seemed to secure the 67-year-old as the US leader's geopolitical dealmaker-in-chief...

Read our profile of Witkoff here:

Since the US proposal of a 30-day ceasefire was raised in talks with Ukrainian officials yesterday, the big question on the lips of analysts has been whether Russia would accept the plans.

That is something US senator Lindsey Graham says he remains "extremely sceptical" about.

He says "it is clear" Volodymyr Zelenskyy is willing to make peace, and repeated Marco Rubio's statement that the ball is now in Russia's court.

"Zelenskyy has passed the test of wanting peace. It is now up to Putin to show his cards," Graham says.

He goes on to say he will be introducing "bone-breaking sanctions and tariffs against Russia before the end of the week" in order to move towards peace.

"If they do not pursue the ceasefire with the same vigour as Ukraine, there will be hell to pay," he adds.

Away from the White House, the UK has summoned its Russian ambassador as the diplomatic spat between the countries deepens.

It says it is clear that Russia is trying to drive the British embassy in Moscow towards closure, and adds it is revoking accreditation for a Russian diplomat and their spouse.

It comes in response to Russia expelling a British diplomat and their spouse earlier this week.

'The depths to which Russia sinks can only be met through strength'

In a statement, the Foreign Office said: "We do not take this decision lightly, but we have always made clear to Russia that if they escalate, we will take reciprocal action. The depths to which Russia sinks can only be met through strength.

"Despite the extremely difficult bilateral relations caused by Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine and long-running campaign of hostile action against the UK, the UK Government believes that maintaining diplomatic channels of communication, and our respective diplomatic missions, is important. 

"It is deeply disappointing that this is continually made more difficult by unprovoked action from Russia. 

"We have drawn a line under this incident and demand Russia do the same. Any further action taken by Russia will be considered an escalation and responded to accordingly."

Donald Trump is hosting Ireland's prime minister at the White House - and with the world's media assembled he isn't missing out on a chance to discuss key issues.

He says the US has received "some positive messages" after its proposal of a ceasefire at talks with Ukraine in Saudi Arabia yesterday.

"Hopefully we can get a ceasefire," he tells reporters, adding "it is up to Russia now".

The US president also says "we have people going to Russia right now" - following reports his Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff will travel to Moscow this week.

That comes after the Kremlin said it will not decide on the US-proposed ceasefire until it hears from the Americans (see 9.49am post).

But Trump also had a warning for Russia, saying "there are things you could do in a financial sense that would be very bad for Russia".

More now on the situation in Kursk - which we've been reporting on throughout the day.

Videos geolocated by Sky News show Russian forces swiftly advancing on the key town of Sudzha on its southern border. 

More than 10 videos show Russian soldiers destroying bridges and recapturing villages, before moving into Sudzha and planting a Russian flag in the centre. 

Ukraine took control of Sudzha during the Kursk offensive in August 2024 in just under two weeks.

Now, in a matter of days, Russian forces have reclaimed the centre of the town.

The map below shows the locations of Russian troops in and around Sudzha that Sky News has verified. The orange dots show Russian troops and advances, and the grey dots show the former positions of Ukrainian troops. 

Ukrainian troops seen fleeing

Sudzha is situated just north of the border to Ukraine in Kursk and had a pre-invasion population of more than 5,000 people. 

The footage we found shows Russian forces closing in on the town by striking surrounding villages and Ukrainian military equipment.  

On 11 March, footage showed large groups of Ukrainian troops pulling back from the centre of Sudzha on foot.  

A day later, Russian forces could be seen posing in the town, holding the flags of the Russian Federation and the Wagner Group.

PM: 'All options on the table' after UK hit by tariffs

Edited by Emily Atkinson

That's it for another week of Prime Minister's Questions, which saw Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch spar over the economy. 

It was Lib Dem leader Ed Davey that cracked open the matter of Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminium. The PM told the Commons he was negotiating an economic deal with the US and he would keep "all options on the table".



Otherwise, that's it from us. Catch you next week - same time, same place.

 In PMQs, Keir Starmer compared the Conservatives' record on immigration returns with that of the current Labour government. 

He said: “we've got the flights off - 19,000 people [have been] removed who shouldn't be here”.

It's true that the Home Office did record 18,987 returns between July 2024 and January 2025 but it is misleading to imply that all of them were actively removed as the figures show a significant number left voluntarily.

Only a quarter of the nearly 19,000 were what the Home Office classifies as “enforced returns”, when an individual is forcibly removed from the country by enforcement agents.

The majority were classified as “voluntary returns” - meaning people who choose to leave of their own accord.

Another set of returns figures (from July to December) show that around a third of voluntary returns were given some sort of financial assistance by the government to help them leave. 

By Anthony Reuben

Kemi Badenoch criticised the prime minister on the basis that council tax is going up in April “after he promised to freeze it”.

The promise to freeze council tax was part of Labour's campaign for the 2023 local elections in England.

Keir Starmer said in March 2023 that he would have frozen council tax the following year if he had been in government.

But Rachel Reeves was asked on the same day whether that meant council tax would be frozen if Labour won the general election and she said: "We'll have to see what the public finances look like going into a general election."

The pledge to freeze council tax was not in the Labour manifesto for last year's general election and we have not been able to find any pledges from the prime minister to do so during that  campaign.

Earlier on, Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said many in Parliament believe the PM ought to be "more robust" with US President Donald Trump.

His comments came after US-imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium came into effect overnight. 

Starmer responded by saying that the UK would take a "pragmatic" approach and "keep all options on the table".

PM: 'All options on the table' after UK hit by tariffs

Joshua NevettReporting from the House of Commons

The row over sentencing guidelines came up and caused a ruckus at PMQs.

So what's it's all about?

It was triggered after the Sentencing Council, which advises judges on prison terms and community punishments, issued new guidance, external for England and Wales.

The new guidelines told judges to order a pre-sentence report if the offender is from a minority background, facing the possibility of jail for the first time, a woman or pregnant.

Opposition politicians had claimed the changes amounted to a "two-tier justice" system.

And last week, Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood wrote to the council urging it to rethink guidance.

Now the Conservatives are trying to put Starmer under more political pressure to go further.

Watch: Sir Keir Starmer asked about welfare at PMQs

The government is planning to make some cuts to welfare and there was some unease over this among Labour MPs sat on the backbenches at PMQs. 

The Labour MP for Leeds East, Richard Burgon, called for a wealth tax, rather than cuts to benefits.

Watching on from the gallery above the chamber was Labour MP Rachel Maskell, who nodded her head, seemingly in agreement.

Maskell recently told the BBC she had picked up "deep, deep concern" among Labour MPs.

She said: "I look in the past at what Labour has achieved in this space and believe that we can hold on to our values, ensure that we're helping people and not harming people."

The BBC understands MPs have been going into Downing Street for briefings about the welfare changes.

Starmer clearly has some work to do to convince sceptical MPs of the merits of his plans.

Prime Minister's Questions is over for another week. Here's what happened: 



Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell raises Starmer's meeting later today with the family of David Amess, after Kemi Badenoch did the same a little earlier. 

He asks the prime minister to reverse the decision to deny the family a public inquiry into the death of Amess and the failure of the Prevent programme.

Starmer responds by acknowledging how heartbroken the family are, and says it's important they meet this afternoon and "discuss all the questions they want to raise with me".

And that's the end of PMQs. We've got further updates and analysis on the way, though - stick with us.

We're now into the section of PMQs where backbench MPs get to ask Starmer the questions on their minds. We'll bring you any key exchanges in our next few posts. 

One such question comes from SNP MP Dave Doogan, who asks the prime minister if he can reassure the Commons that US President Donald Trump is listening to the UK - with regards to reaching a peace deal for Russia's war in Ukraine.

Starmer says there was a huge amount of work to make sure yesterday's talks in Saudi Arabia could go as well as possible, and he's extremely pleased about the reinstated US support to Ukraine.

"As ever, we must go further," he adds.

Joshua NevettReporting from the House of Commons

The PM was widely considered to have performed well at the White House last month, and even earned plaudits from Conservatives. There was talk of an economic deal, albeit a limited one, and hope that the UK would be exempt from Trump's tariffs.

But with US tariffs on steel and aluminium coming into effect overnight, that hope has proved to be an illusion. 

It's a political vulnerability and here at PMQs, it was just targeted by Lib Dem leader Ed Davey.

Davey asked Starmer whether he'd fly to Canada to show solidarity with the country, after it was hit with US tariffs.

Starmer said the UK would take a pragmatic approach but “keep all options on the table”.

Dealing with Trump is the diplomatic version of treading on eggshells. Labour has tiptoed around the eggshells so far - but will be keen to find firmer footing if the tariffs start to bite.

A question now from Lib Dem leader Ed Davey, who wants to know if Starmer understands that for many disabled people, the best way to get them into work is to support them with more equipment, training, and healthcare.

Starmer responds by saying what the current government has inherited is "shocking" - and that "one in eight young people are not in education, work or training". He adds that the Tories "did nothing for 14 years".

Davey then congratulates Starmer on helping to restore US aid and intelligence-sharing to Ukraine, but asks if the UK should be more robust against Donald Trump's metal tariffs.

Starmer says he's "disappointed" by the tariffs on steel and aluminium, but he is negotiating an economic deal with the US. He says he will keep all options on the table.

Watch: Kemi Badenoch focuses on economy at PMQs

Badenoch was laser-focused on the Labour's handling of the economy, in particular the rise in the National Insurance (NIC) rate for employers, which is set to increase from 13.8% to 15% from 6 April 2025.

Badenoch repeatedly called it a “jobs tax”.

Interestingly, she also framed the chancellor's Spring Statement as an “emergency Budget”, given it's expected to include spending cuts.

But Starmer insisted his government was “picking up the mess” left by the Conservatives and pointed to what he called a £22bn “hole” in the public finances.

Chris MasonPolitical editor, in the House of Commons

It's all gone a bit panto in here with the jeering and
cheering.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves shook her head repeatedly when
the Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch described the Spring Statement in a
fortnight as an “emergency Budget.”

Badenoch claimed the government had trashed the “economy
with their bad choices".

The prime minister responded by pointing to what he saw as
the repeated economic failures of the previous Conservative government.

Badenoch suggests the government is going to bring an "emergency Budget" in two weeks, saying Labour will try and make out it's because of global events - but she claims the truth is "they trashed the economy with their bad choices".

This is a high-tax, low-growth, job-killing government, she says. 

Starmer responds, saying inflation was 11% under the Conservatives and repeats that they left a £22bn "black hole". 

"And they want to give lectures on the economy", he says, "no thank you."

Badenoch next says everyday businesses tell her they're going bust and that supermarket prices are due to go up 4% because of Labour's job tax. 

She continues, saying the budget is also "killing farming in this country". 

Responding, Starmer says his government's Budget provided more money for farmers and thousands of farms have benefitted from farming schemes. 

Badenoch says rubbish in Birmingham and Liverpool is piling up, and people are getting "trash" - just like "what he's saying at the dispatch box".

People all over the country are suffering, she says, adding that care home fees are set to go up by £3,000 because of the government's jobs tax.

How does he expect pensioners to make ends meet, she asks.

Starmer responds by saying the current government is "picking up and fixing the mess" that the Conservatives left. 

Back to Badenoch, who says the average council tax bill is going up by more than £100 - on average - in April after he promised to freeze it. 

"Why should these families pay more for less?", she asks the PM - again focusing her questions on Labour's economic policies. 

Starmer says the Tories put up council tax every year for 12 of the 14 years they were in power.

Watch: Leaders clash over cost of living at PMQs

Badenoch,in turn, says the PM "needs to get out more" - and that inflation is up and "estimates of job losses are between 130,000 and 300,000".

His tax rises are hurting every sector of the economy, the Tory leader says, adding that nurseries are telling parents that fees are going up. How is more expensive childcare good for the economy or families, she asks.

Starmer says the government is "putting in childcare", and talks about bringing in more breakfast clubs. 

She's forgetting the £22bn "black hole" left by the Conservatives, he says, claiming Badenoch is attacking Labour measures without saying she would reverse them "because she wants all the benefits" but "doesn't want to pay for it". 

Keir Starmer responds by paying tribute to David Amess himself, outlining his plans to meet the family later on and "get answers to questions" they have.

Onto the Budget end of Badenoch's question, the PM says Labour has secured thousands of new jobs into the economy, that wages are up, that there is more investment and that there has been a boost to the cost of living.

There are cheers from his bench at this point.

Kemi Badenoch kicks off her questioning by highlighting Starmer's upcoming meeting with the family of Davis Amess, a Tory MP who was murdered in 2021.

She asks if Starmer agrees that getting a response to his murder - and how it was allowed to happen - is vital for the UK's democracy.

She then asks the prime minister if he has been given an estimate of how many people will lose their jobs because of his government's Budget.

The European Union on Wednesday announced retaliatory trade action with new duties on U.S. industrial and farm products, responding within hours to the Trump administration's increase in tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25 per cent.

The world's biggest trading bloc was expecting the U.S. tariffs and prepared in advance, but the measures still place great strain on already tense transatlantic relations. Only last month, Washington warned Europe that it would have to take care of its own security in the future.

The EU measures will cover goods from the United States worth some 26 billion euros ($40 billion Cdn) — and not just steel and aluminum products. Textiles, home appliances, agricultural goods will be hit with tariffs, as will motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans, the latter of which were also taxed during U.S. President Donald Trump's first term.

The EU duties aim for pressure points in the U.S. while minimizing additional damage to Europe. The tariffs — taxes on imports — primarily target Republican-held states, hitting soybeans in House Speaker Mike Johnson's Louisiana, and also beef and poultry in Kansas and Nebraska. Produce in Alabama, Georgia and Virginia is also on the list.

The European Commission, which manages trade and commercial conflicts on behalf of the 27 EU member countries, said leather goods and agricultural products beyond beef and poultry would be hit, including some seafood, nuts, eggs, sugar and vegetables.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement that the bloc "will always remain open to negotiation."

"As the U.S. are applying tariffs worth 28 billion dollars, we are responding with countermeasures worth 26 billion euros," she said. "We firmly believe that in a world fraught with geopolitical and economic uncertainties, it is not in our common interest to burden our economies with tariffs."

Trudeau seeks closer ties, trade with European allies also targeted by Trump

Trump said his taxes would help create U.S. factory jobs, but von der Leyen said: "Jobs are at stake. Prices will go up. In Europe and in the United States."

"We deeply regret this measure. Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business and even worse for consumers. These tariffs are disrupting supply chains. They bring uncertainty for the economy," she said.

The American Chamber of Commerce to the EU said the U.S. tariffs and EU countermeasures "will only harm jobs, prosperity and security on both sides of the Atlantic."

"The two sides must de-escalate and find a negotiated outcome urgently," the chamber said Wednesday.

Trump slapped similar tariffs on EU steel and aluminum during his first term in office, which enraged European and other allies. The EU also imposed countermeasures in retaliation at the time.

This time, the EU action will involve two steps. First, on April 1, the commission will reintroduce what it calls "rebalancing measures," which the EU had from 2018 and 2020 but were then suspended under the Biden administration. Then on April 13 come the additional duties targeting 18 billion euros ($19.6 billion) in U.S. exports to the bloc.

What does Trump really want?

EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic travelled to Washington last month in an effort to head off the tariffs, meeting with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and other top trade officials.

He said on Wednesday that it became clear during the trip "that the EU is not the problem."

"I argued to avoid the unnecessary burden of measures and countermeasures, but you need a partner for that. You need both hands to clap," Sefcovic told reporters at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France.

The EU could lose up to 3.7 million tons of steel exports, according to the European steel association Eurofer. The U.S. is the second-biggest export market for EU steel producers, representing 16 per cent of the total EU steel exports.

The EU estimates that annual trade volume between both sides stands at about $1.5 trillion US, representing some 30 per cent of global trade. While the bloc has a substantial export surplus in goods, it says that is partly offset by the U.S. surplus in the trade of services.

Britain, which isn't part of the EU, meanwhile said it won't impose retaliatory measures of its own on the U.S.

Civil defense boats search for Sudiksha Konanki, a university student from the U.S. who disappeared on a beach in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, Monday, March. 10, 2025. (AP Photo/Francesco Spotorno)AP

A person of interest has been named in the disappearance of University of Pittsburgh student Sudishka Konanki, who went missing while on vacation in the Dominican Republic.

Fox News reported that Joshua Riibe, 24, of Iowa, is a person of interest in missing person's case, according to Loudoun County, Virginia Sheriff's Office spokesperson Thomas Julia. 

However, Julia said that this is still “a missing person case, not a criminal case,” and that Riibe has not been accused of any crimes. 

“Sheriff [Michael] Chapman wants to make sure the investigation is comprehensive and includes all possible assets and techniques,” Julia said to Fox News. “We are working closely with the FBI on all of this, and they are working with the Dominican National Police.”

Konanki, 20, a junior at the University of Pittsburgh, is a resident of Virginia's Loudoun County and also a citizen of India. She was traveling with five other female Pittsburgh students and last seen on March 6 walking on a beach at Riu Republica Resort in Punta Cana. 

Authorities are searching for Sudiksha Konanki, who went missing while on vacation in the Dominican Republic.Provided

Hotel surveillance footage taken at about 4:15 a.m. showed Konanki heading towards the beach with five other women and two men. The group had been drinking in the hotel's lobby around an hour earlier, CNN reported. 

Cameras captured the group, minus Konanki and one of the men at about 4:55 a.m. 

The man told authorities he and Konanki went into the ocean but he felt ill, got out of the water and fell asleep on a lounge chair.

Officials said the man was interviewed several times and gave differing details each time, CNN said, but there were no major inconsistencies and translation issues might have been the reason for any discrepancies.

It is not clear if Riibe and the man who was on the beach with Konanki are the same person.

U.S. federal authorities, including the FBI, are on the ground in the Dominican Republic assisting in the search.

“It's already four days and everybody's so worried,” family friend Shekar Pendem said to CNN. The Konanki family has lived in the U.S. since 2006 and are permanent residents in Virginia.

Anyone with information on Konanki's whereabouts is asked to call the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office at 703-777-1021.

A party that has sharply criticized President Donald Trump's threat to take over Greenland secured a surprise election victory Tuesday in the Danish territory, but it may have to govern with a partner with a far warmer view of the U.S. president.  

The center-right, pro-business Demokraatit party, which favors a gradual move toward independence from Denmark, won 30% of the total vote share, not enough to single-handedly rule the Arctic territory. The party will instead need to partner with opponents to form a coalition.  

Foremost among those other parties is the second-placed opposition party Naleraq, which won a quarter of the vote share, favors rapid independence and has reserved warm words for the Trump administration. 

The victory of two parties who favor independence — seceding from Denmark is broadly popular in Greenland — may be taken as a positive in Washington, where interest in the world's largest island has sharply jumped since President Trump began his second term.

Greenland won the right to hold a referendum to gain full independence from Denmark in 2009, but a poll at the time also found that many were divided on the pace at which to do so. Greenland currently is in charge of its own domestic affairs, while Denmark controls decisions on foreign and defense policy.

"We don't want independence tomorrow, we want a good foundation,” the Demokraatit leader and incumbent prime minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen told reporters Tuesday night in the capital, Nuuk.

Trump sees Greenland's vast mineral wealth and existing U.S. military base as being of strategic importance as the Arctic region opens up and increasingly comes into play in the geopolitical arena, but both Nuuk and Copenhagen have rebuffed those overtures.

“We need Greenland for national security. One way or the other we're gonna get it,” Trump told Congress during an address last week. 

Those comments directly oppose those of Nielsen, who during Tuesday's vote told NBC News international partner Sky News that he wanted the vote to send “a clear message to him that we are not for sale.” 

“We don't want to be Americans. No, we don't want to be Danes. We want to be Greenlanders. And we want our own independence in the future. And we want to build our own country by ourselves, not with his hope,” Nielsen added.

But the White House may have found a kindred spirit in the main independence party, Naleraq. Social media influencer and Naleraq candidate Qupanuk Olsen previously told Reuters that “I strongly believe all this interest from Trump and the rest of the world is definitely speeding up our independence process times 100.” 

Speaking about Trump at an election watch party in Nuuk on Tuesday, Naleraq party member Kuno Fencker told Reuters that “he respects our right to self-determination. ... If he wants to invest in Greenland, he is absolutely welcome to do that.”

While the vast majority of Greenlanders support independence, they remain opposed to Trump's overtures, according to a January poll commissioned by the Danish newspaper Berlingske and Greenlandic daily Sermitsiaq. 

Even so, analysts say that the secessionist platforms of both parties may create an opening for greater U.S. influence.

The two parties will likely “try to get more investments” out of America's interest in the island, Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen, an associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College, told NBC News before the vote on Monday.

“A big victory for the Naleraq Party will be seen as a victory for Donald Trump,” he added.

Former Prime Minister Múte Egede called an early election in February amid Trump's comments that acquiring Greenland was vital to security interests. 

“We are in the midst of a serious time. A time we have never experienced in our country,” he said at the time in a post on Facebook.

When news that his party had secured the largest voting share began to filter through, Nielsen said at an event in Nuuk that “people want change. ... We want more business to finance our welfare,” according to Reuters.

The key difference between the two parties is that Naleraq's main goal is rapid independence from Denmark, Dwayne Menezes, managing director of the London-based think tank Polar Research and Policy Initiative, told NBC News in a statement Wednesday. "For Demokraatit, it is more of an end goal,” he added. 

Bolstered by American interest in mineral wealth, Naleraq has pushed for a referendum in the next four years and aims to strike a secessionist deal with Copenhagen. 

With a coalition not yet agreed upon, the impact of the vote remains unclear for both the Trump administration and Greenland's 56,000 citizens.

            An elected leader once dubbed “The Punisher” is on his way to The Hague to face trial for crimes against humanity during a brutal war on drugs, in a breathtaking reversal of fortune for a politician who once openly boasted about killing people and placing opponents on hit lists.
    


            Rodrigo Duterte ran the Philippines for six turbulent years, during which he oversaw a brutal crackdown on drugs, openly threatened critics with death and tongue-lashed a host of global leaders from the Pope to former US President Barack Obama.
    


            A former prosecutor, congressman and mayor, Duterte built his no-holds-bared reputation in the southern Philippine city of Davao. He swept to the presidency in 2016 on a populist – and popular – promise to replicate the hardline tactics of his hometown and wage war against drugs and drug pushers across the Southeast Asian nation.
    


            “All of you who are into drugs, you sons of b**ches, I will really kill you,” he told a huge crowd in one of his many characteristically profane-laced 2016 campaign speeches. “I have no patience, I have no middle ground. Either you kill me or I will kill you idiots.”
    


            Once in power he unleashed what rights groups called “death squads” to eradicate drug pushers – many of the victims young men from impoverished shanty towns, shot by police and rogue gunmen as part of a campaign to target dealers.
    


            Police data said 6,000 people were killed. Some rights groups say the death toll could be as high as 30,000 with innocents and bystanders often caught in the crossfire.
    


            Duterte's blood-soaked presidency ended in 2022. Three years later, only 8 policemen had been convicted for 5 of the victims killed in the war on drugs, according to court documents.
    

In video posted by his daughter, Rodrigo Duterte questions his detainment. The former Philippine president was taken into custody on March 11 after the country's government said it received an International Criminal Court warrant for his arrest for alleged crimes against humanity.

            The ICC launched an investigation into allegations of “crimes against humanity” committed by Duterte during both his time as national leader and mayor of Davao.
    


            Duterte has long denied the accusations of human rights abuses and contends the drug issue is one for domestic law enforcement. He has repeatedly said he will not kowtow to foreign jurisdiction and taunted the ICC, urging prosecutors to “hurry up” and move on him.
    


            Two days before his arrest, he slammed the ICC in a typically fiery speech to supporters in Hong Kong.
    


            “From my own news, I have a warrant…from the ICC or something… these motherf***ers have been chasing me for a long time. What did I do wrong ?” he said.
    


            But the tide had suddenly turned. Authorities were waiting for Duterte to return from Hong Kong, and arrested him at the main airport in Manila, sparking chaotic scenes.
    


            As the news filtered out, many were left in shock.
    


            Some flocked to churches in the majority Catholic country to attend impromptu mass to commemorate the thousands of victims of his drug war, seeing the move as a first step towards overdue justice.
    


            And just before midnight, Duterte was back on a plane – this time bound for the Netherlands in what appeared to be a stunning end to a stormy and violent stint at the top of Philippine politics.
    


            The arrest likely owes more to Duterte being on the wrong side of a feud between two of the Philippine's most high-profile families than the might of the ICC, which cannot carry out arrests on its own and relies on the cooperation of national governments to execute warrants
    


            Duterte's clan was previously in an alliance with the famed Marcos political dynasty, with his daughter Sara Duterte-Carpio serving as deputy to current President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.
    


            But in recent months the alliance collapsed, descending into public tirades and name-calling.
    


            In October, Duterte-Carpio aired a litany of grievances against the president in a two-hour livestreamed press conference, saying she “wanted to chop his head off.”
    


            Then she said in an online news conference on November 23 that she had contracted an assassin to kill Marcos, his wife and House Speak Martin Romualdez if she were killed, a threat she warned wasn't a joke.
    


            Marcos had said the Philippines will “disengage” from any contact with the ICC, as Manila does not recognize its authority over matters of national sovereignty.
    


            That's because Duterte withdrew the Philippines from the court in 2019.
    


            But under the ICC's withdrawal mechanism, the court keeps jurisdiction over crimes committed during the membership period of a state.
    


            President Marcos said he was obliged to follow Interpol's request to arrest Duterte.
    


            “Interpol asked for help, and we obliged because we have commitments to the Interpol, which we have to fulfil. If we don't do that, they will not, they will no longer help us with other cases involving Filipino fugitives abroad,” Marcos said in a late-night presser after the plane carrying Duterte took off.
    


            Carlos Conde, a Philippines researcher for Human Rights Watch (HRW) Conde said Duterte's swift arrest and removal was a “pleasant surprise” that caught also a lot of people off guard.
    


            “The victims of the drug war – thousands of victims – have pretty much lost faith in the domestic accountability mechanisms in the Philippines. So, they were pinning their hopes on the ICC,” he told CNN.
    


            Nobel laureate Maria Ressa told CNN Duterte's arrest marks a major moment for the country and signals that years of impunity can be ended.
    


            “It's historic for the Philippines, it's the first time a Philippine president has been arrested for crimes against humanity. That an Interpol-led arrest actually ended this impunity under president Duterte that now has him going to The Hague,” said Ressa, former CNN Manila bureau chief and CEO and founder of news site Rappler.
    


            Human rights campaigner Aurora Parong told CNN many advocates and drug war victims' family members were elated with a momentary sense of relief after hearing Duterte had indeed been arrested.

            “But there is this mixed feeling of joy and hope and anxiety because we do not exactly know where this will end up to what will be the outcome. Will there really be accountability?” said Parong, who is also co-chair of the Philippine Coalition for the ICC (PCICC).
    


            But she cautioned it would be an excruciatingly long road to justice.
    


            “It is time consuming. It will take years before there will be a conviction at the International Criminal Court. The waiting is really difficult for the victims and the families of the victims of the bloody war on drugs.”
    


            Located in The Hague in the Netherlands, the ICC investigates and prosecutes individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and crimes of aggression against the territory of its member states, of which there are 125.
    


            Duterte's arrest and transfer is a significant victory for the body. The court cannot carry out arrests on its own and relies on the cooperation of national governments to execute warrants – which often rests on domestic politics and political will on whether to follow through.
    


            Many of those on its wanted list remain at large, unruffled by the serious charges laid against them.
    


            The court has been rounded on by the United States for seeking the arrests of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity for Israel's military actions in Gaza following Hamas' October 7, 2023, attack.
    


            The ICC simultaneously sought the arrests of top Hamas leaders, including Yahya Sinwar, who was later killed.

            The court has also issued a warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin for his invasion of Ukraine, although it is unlikely the warrant will be served any time soon. Putin travelled to ICC member Mongolia last year, but was not arrested.

NEW DELHI (AP) — Elon Musk's Starlink signed an agreement with India's top telecom operator on Wednesday to bring the U.S. satellite internet giant's services to the world's most populous country, a day after announcing a similar agreement with the country's second-largest provider.

The deals with Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel, which together control more than 70% of India's telecom market, could help bring internet connections to millions of people who live in remote areas.

But they depend on Starlink obtaining government approval to enter India. The partnership announcements come weeks after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Musk in Washington.



  Deals will put Starlink devices in stores across India
 

Wednesday's deal will allow Starlink to stock and sell its equipment in Jio's thousands of retail outlets, giving the company direct distribution across India. Starlink will also use its partners' network infrastructure to enhance satellite coverage across India, where a vast population still lacks internet access.

A statement from Jio said Starlink will compliment the Indian telecom giant's broadband services “by extending high-speed internet to the most challenging of locations in a quick and affordable manner."

Jio will also provide installation and activation support for the Starlink devices, the statement said.



  India has long been out of reach for Musk's companies
 

Jio has long been at odds with Starlink over methods for awarding satellite service spectrum in India.

Jio had urged Indian government to grant spectrum for satellite services through auctions to ensure fair competition, while Musk wanted spectrum to be allocated administratively, in line with global trends. Indian government eventually decided to assign satellite spectrum.

It is unclear whether Starlink's licence application has already been approved, but local media reports suggest it is nearing initial regulatory approval.

Last November, India's telecoms minister, Jyotiraditya Scindia, said Starlink had yet to comply with security norms, and that a license would be issued to the company only after it meets all the requirements.

Yet the biggest challenge Starlink faces in India could be pricing.

Mobile data in India is among the world's cheapest — Ambani's Jio once even gave it for free with mobile plans. 

Tesla, Musk's electric car maker, has also faced hurdles in India due to the country's high import duties on vehicles, but it could be getting a boost as well. The copmany began hiring in India last month and has also signed a lease deal to open its first showroom in Mumbai, according to local news reports.



  Starlink could help India bring millions online in remote areas 
 

At least 40% of the country's more than 1.4 billion people don't have access to the internet. Cheap satellite broadband is needed to bridge this gap, particularly in India's vast remote and mountainous rural areas.

Starlink has at least 6,900 active satellites orbiting Earth that provide low-latency broadband, including to areas where internet previously has been completely unavailable.

To make a lasting change, we carry out in-depth work with governments and institutions. We offer concrete solutions and launch international initiatives. We are on the ground to assist journalists in danger. Anywhere and anytime.

Do you believe there can be no freedom of conscience without freedom of the press? Do you want to help free and independent journalism, and those who embody it? Do you want to defend the right to information? There are several ways to support RSF: find the one that suits you and join the fight!

Go behind the scenes of RSF and discover in detail our operations, our teams, our funding, our governance… but also our favourite picks, partners, projects and events we support and who act in their own way to advance our commmon ideal.

Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has restored access to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) website in countries where it has previously been censored, through its Collateral Freedom mirroring project. The initiative to unblock access to one of the world's most important news organizations marks a significant step in RSF's fight against online censorship.

The BBC's online services have been blocked for years in countries like China, Iran and Russia, and to a lesser extent in Vietnam and Turkmenistan. RSF has deployed cutting-edge technology to bypass government-imposed restrictions, ensuring that millions of people around the world can once again access the broadcaster's independent journalism online.In 2023, RSF created a mirror website for BBC Persian, the BBC's farsi service  Since then, the project has expanded to included the entire BBC website in 43 languages, mirrored and accessible through this link.

“By harnessing innovative technology to deploy mirror sites, we ensure that vital, independent journalism remains accessible even in the most repressive digital environments. Collateral Freedom is not only about bypassing censorship—it's about safeguarding the fundamental right to information for everyone, everywhere.

“The drastic reduction in press freedom and increase in interference in distribution means it's even tougher for audiences to access independent and impartial news in some countries. All audiences around the world should be able to access BBC News services. By working with RSF, we are able to provide the tools needed to circumvent the severe restrictions on free media.

Collateral Freedom is an anti-censorship operation that leverages the use of mirror sites – real-time exact replicas of censored websites hosted on content delivery networks (CDNs). The method of unblocking requires no installation of additional applications.  

A growth of 56% media mirrored in twelve months

With a 56% increase in mirrored media since 2024, RSF continues to expand its efforts to counter online censorship and safeguard press freedom worldwide, allowing 156 media outlets to still reach their audiences despite censorship. The list of unblocked sites is available on the operation's GitHub page, except where security concerns require media outlets to remain discreet.

In July 2024, RSF expanded its efforts by creating mirror sites for several European media outlets censored in Russia, including the Franco-German public service channel Arte. In 2024-2025, websites blocked on Chinese network were also mirrored by RSF such as the Taiwanese media New Bloom, an online magazine covering activism in Taiwan, and Canadian organisation Citizen Lab, a pioneer in forensic analysis of spyware, which back in 2017 denounced the use of Pegasus spyware to spy on journalists.

Your donations enable RSF to keep working. We depend on you in order to be able to monitor respect for press freedom and take action worldwide.

Media freedom is a fundamental right, but nearly half of the world's population has no access to freely reported news and information.

The president has described Mahmoud Khalil's arrest as the first ‘of many to come.' And experts say, while not common, revoking green cards does happen.

Can Trump Deport a Green Card Holder?

Seth Wenig|AP

Protesters demonstrate for the release of Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, on March 11, in Newark, New Jersey. 




ICE officers arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a recent graduate of Columbia University, after he helped lead 2024 campus protests against Israel's actions in Gaza.
President Donald Trump has promised the arrest is the first “of many to come.”
As the government attempts to deport Khalil, who is in the U.S. legally, analysts say the administration has a lot of discretion in situations like these.




The arrest of a Columbia University graduate over the weekend has prompted fierce backlash as President Donald Trump moves to punish pro-Palestinian protesters at colleges and universities by raising the specter of deportation.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers on Saturday arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a December graduate with a master's degree from the university's School of International and Public Affairs, after he helped lead campus demonstrations last year protesting Israel's actions in Gaza since the start of the war against Hamas.

Such protests spread to college campuses nationwide, but they were particularly virulent at Columbia, where in-person classes were canceled, students took over an administrative building and police were called in to clear their encampment. Jewish students complained of feeling threatened and ostracized, and reports of antisemitic language and imagery were widespread.

Khalil, who remains at risk of deportation even though his removal was initially blocked by a federal judge, holds a green card and is married to an American citizen, according to The New York Times. The same judge on Wednesday ruled that Khalil will remain at a Louisiana detention center temporarily as he weighs arguments.

The White House – and the president himself – nonetheless boasted about Khalil's arrest on social media, with Trump pledging, “This is the first arrest of many to come,” and claiming “there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity.” The post came after his administration on Friday canceled $400 million in federal grants and contracts to Columbia because of what it said was the university's failure to combat antisemitism on campus – the first of what will likely be more actions targeting universities.

Elliott Davis Jr.Feb. 26, 2025



Secretary of State Marco Rubio also said in his own post that the administration “will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.”

“If you support terrorism, including the slaughtering of innocent men, women, and children, your presence is contrary to our national and foreign policy interests, and you are not welcome here,” Trump's post reads. “We expect every one of America's Colleges and Universities to comply.”

The latest escalation comes after Trump issued an executive order in January aimed at combating antisemitism that directed officials to explore investigations of foreign-born students accused of antisemitic actions on college campuses and consider “if warranted, actions to remove such aliens.” The White House later promised more directly to “deport Hamas sympathizers and revoke student visas.”

The legal basis for Khalil's arrest has not been disclosed publicly, but the Times reported that the administration is relying on a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which states, “an alien whose presence or activities in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable ground to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States is deportable.” That text closely mirrors the language used in the president's Truth Social post regarding “national and foreign policy interests.”

The American Civil Liberties Union released a statement on Monday condemning the arrest as “unprecedented, illegal, and un-American.” But others say there are nuances when it comes to the legality of the Trump administration's move. Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a lawyer and analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, notes “how much discretion” the U.S. government has when it comes to granting benefits such as green cards, visas and asylum.

“The U.S. government has a number of ways or justifications for removing people's benefits and deporting them,” she notes, while adding that it is “somewhat common for lawful permanent residents to be ordered deported.”

This is partly because lawful permanent resident status does not come with the same rights American citizens have. Linda Dakin-Grimm, an attorney who concentrates on pro bono immigration matters and also is a senior consulting partner at Milbank LLP, says she stresses this distinction when she represents people who get green cards. She notes that “if you engage in certain conduct, you'll probably have the consequences of that conduct,” including losing lawful permanent residence status.

“The issue is going to come down to: Did (Khalil) do something that they can prove that violated the terms of his current status?” Dakin-Grimm says. “And if he did, then it's a kind of cautionary tale.”

One of the things someone with a green card is prohibited from doing is “committing fraud in any way in the process,” Dakin-Grimm adds. For instance, she says the application has “about 100 questions on it that ask you 50 ways to Sunday: ‘Do you have any connection with terrorist organizations?'” Dakin-Grimm clarifies that she's not saying this is the case with Khalil, but if he has “some sort of provable relationship with Hamas” – which the U.S. designates as a terrorist organization – and he did not disclose it on his application, “that alone could be enough to revoke his green card.” If this is part of the federal government's evidence, the attorneys have the burden of proving it in front of an immigration judge – an administrative position that falls under the Department of Justice, she notes.

Heightened scrutiny about possible affiliations with terrorist organizations is not new, Bush-Joseph says. It's one product of the post-9/11 world. A Government Accountability Office report from 2009 about actions needed at the time to address vulnerabilities in the process for granting permanent residency noted concerns “that terrorists or their supporters would seek to immigrate to the United States.”

“On the other hand, as a general matter, I can say that the Trump administration has already demonstrated that it's willing to really push the boundaries of immigration law and constitutional norms,” Bush-Joseph adds. “What additional authorities or policies and procedures will the Trump administration try to invoke?”

U.S. and Ukrainian negotiators have agreed to a full 30-day pause in fighting.

LONDON -- The prospect of a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine is "in Moscow's hands," a top aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said following successful U.S.-Ukraine talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday.

Andriy Yermak -- the head of Zelenskyy's office -- was part of the Ukrainian delegation that met with American representatives in Jeddah, where both teams agreed to pursue a 30-day ceasefire and use the pause in fighting as a launchpad for full peace negotiations to end Russia's three-year-old invasion of its neighbor.

"Ukraine is ready to accept a 30-day ceasefire if Russia agrees," Yermak wrote on Telegram on Wednesday morning. "This is a necessary step to begin work on real security guarantees and preparing the final terms of a peace agreement."

"But now the key is in Moscow's hands -- the whole world will see who really wants to end the war and who is simply playing for time," he added.

Moscow was readying itself to hear details from Tuesday's U.S.-Ukraine meeting, with officials "scrutinizing" the publicly released statements, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday.

He added that Russia "doesn't want to get ahead of itself" on the potential ceasefire, saying the Kremlin will want to first get specifics directly from Washington. A "summit phone call" may be in the cards, he said.

President Donald Trump's return to office has put Ukraine in a strategic bind, no longer able to rely on the "ironclad" -- if at times hesitant, according to many Ukrainians -- American support during former President Joe Biden's time in office.

Trump has aligned with Russian narratives about the conflict, framing Ukraine as the key impediment to peace, falsely blaming Kyiv for starting the war, undermining Zelenskyy's legitimacy as president and seeking to recoup years of American aid via a controversial minerals sharing deal.

Last week, the Trump administration announced a freeze on U.S. military aid to and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. Tuesday's meeting in Saudi Arabia saw that pause lifted, officials said.

Moscow has welcomed the radical U.S. shift in rhetoric and policy, which culminated in an explosive Trump-Zelenskyy Oval Office meeting last month.

Kyiv has been striving to prove its readiness for peace while stressing that no deal can succeed without American security guarantees to deter repeat Russian aggression. Ukrainian leaders have also cast doubt on President Vladimir Putin's readiness to end the fighting and urged their U.S. partners to be wary of the Kremlin.

Following Tuesday's talks, Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram of the 30-day ceasefire plan, "Ukraine accepts this proposal, we consider it positive, we are ready to take this step. The United States of America needs to convince Russia to do so."

"We agree, and if the Russians agree, the silence will take effect at that very moment," he added. "An important element in today's discussions is America's readiness to restore defense assistance to Ukraine and intelligence support."

"Ukraine is ready for peace," Zelenskyy wrote. "Russia must also show whether it is ready to end the war -- or continue it. The time has come for the whole truth. I thank everyone who helps Ukraine."

Speaking in Kyiv on Wednesday, Zelenskyy said he is "very serious" about a ceasefire. "For me it is important to end the war," he added.

"I want the president of the United States to see it, I want Americans to see and feel it," Zelenskyy said. "I want Europe and all to be in alliance in order to do everything to force Russia to end this war."

"As for the security guarantees, we will talk about them in more details if there is ceasefire for 30 days," the president continued. "These 30 days are given to prepare a draft. We have our proposals, but we will draft the steps that we will agree on with our allies and formats of security guarantees which Ukraine will have after the war is over."

"Today, everything depends on the fact whether Russia wants to cease fire or to continue killing people. Today, it fully depends on this country. United States of America demonstrated its steps and position. Ukraine demonstrated and outlined its positions in a very direct way, without any reservations. And Russia will have to answer to that."

"I believe that the meeting itself in Saudi Arabia ruins Russian plans to escalate relations between Ukraine and United States," Zelenskyy said. "On the contrary, there is de-escalation."

Trump told reporters on Wednesday that the administration hasn't spoken to Putin yet "with substance" regarding the ceasefire proposal.

"We haven't spoken to him yet with substance because we just found out and we just were able to get Ukraine to agree," he said. "So, we're going to know very soon. I've gotten some positive messages, but a positive message means nothing. This is a very serious situation."

Trump would not comment on whether he has a meeting with Putin scheduled.

"But we had a great success yesterday," he said.

"It's up to Russia now," Trump said. "But we've had a good relationship with both parties, actually. And we'll see. People are going to Russia right now as we speak. And hopefully we can get a ceasefire from Russia."

Trump declined to get into specifics when asked what he can do to pressure Russia to agree to the ceasefire proposal.

"We can, but I hope it's not going to be necessary," he said.

"There are things you could do that that wouldn't be pleasant in a financial sense," he added, without providing any specifics. "I can do things financially that would be very bad for Russia. I don't want to do that because I want to get peace."

The president then reiterated his previous claim that Ukraine would be a bigger obstacle in negotiations.

"We've got Ukraine done. And, as you as you know, I've always said that Ukraine might have been the more difficult party," he said.

Trump said he is pressing for peace amid mounting casualties in the war, which he claimed was "over nothing."

"We're all working hard to get this thing finished," he said. "It's crazy, over nothing, and it's not going to go anywhere. It's just a terrible situation. And I think, and I think we have a chance to get it done."

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday that Washington, D.C., will pursue "multiple points of contact" with Russia to see if Putin is ready to negotiate an end to the war.

"The ball is truly in their court," Rubio said during a refueling stop in Shannon, Ireland, as quoted by The Associated Press. Rubio also said he hopes Russia will end attacks on Ukraine in the coming days.

"We don't think it's constructive to stand here today and say what we're going to do if Russia says no," Rubio said, adding he would avoid statements that "are abrasive in any way."

Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff -- who took part in the recent U.S. talks with both Ukraine and Russia -- is due to visit Moscow "in the coming days," according to a source familiar with the plans. Russia's state-run RIA Novosti news agency also reported Wednesday that CIA Director Jim Ratcliffe spoke by phone with Sergey Naryshkin, the head of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, meanwhile, said in an interview published Wednesday that he does not believe Trump wants to provide security guarantees to Ukraine.

"He has his own view of the situation, which he regularly and directly states," Lavrov said. "This war should never have started."

Despite apparent progress in Jeddah, the fighting continues. Fierce combat is ongoing all along the front lines, particularly in the western Russian Kursk region, where Moscow's forces are pushing Ukrainian troops back from positions seized in a surprise August offensive.

Overnight, both sides launched drones across the shared border. Russia's Defense Ministry reported the downing of 21 Ukrainian UAVs.

Ukraine's air force reported three missiles and 133 drones launched into the country overnight. The air force said 98 of the drones were shot down and 20 were lost in flight without causing damage. Odesa, Kharkiv, Sumy and Kyiv regions were affected, the air force said.

Five people were killed and 12 injured due to shelling in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine on Wednesday, according to Ukrainian emergency officials.

One person was killed and 15 more were injured in strikes on the city of Kryvyi Rih, Zelenskyy's hometown, in central Ukraine, according to Ukrainian emergency officials.

Former senior Canadian intelligence officials say Canada needs to be on the lookout for campaigns aimed at destabilizing the country amid U.S. President Donald Trump's escalating 51st state threats.

And they told CBC News that the most potent weapon wielded by the Trump administration to advance the cause of annexation would likely not be the intelligence agencies directed by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard.

"I would regard Mr. Musk as a problem," said Ward Elcock, who headed CSIS for a decade including during the 9/11 attacks and also served as national security adviser. "I think that's on a number of fronts."

The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has worked to destabilize many governments and nations in the past, using methods as mundane as corruption and as drastic as assassination, but the former spy chiefs say a campaign aimed at Canada would likely rely less on cloak-and-dagger tactics and more on social media — such as the Elon Musk-owned X platform.

"Is [Trump] trying to change political views in this country? If so, that's foreign interference," said Dick Fadden, who also headed CSIS and served as national security adviser to former prime minister Stephen Harper.

"It's no more acceptable from the United States than it is from China or Russia or anybody else."

Neil Bisson is a former CSIS intelligence officer who is now director of the Global Intelligence Knowledge Network and teaches at the University of Ottawa's Professional Development Institute.

He says that in spite of visible signs of Canadian unity in the face of annexation threats, there are those who are vulnerable to the siren call, particularly among the young who feel economically disadvantaged.

"That would be one of the linchpins, one of the cracks in the armour that another country would be looking at trying to exploit," he told CBC News. "If you have individuals who are concerned about where their next meal is coming from or if they're going to get a roof over their head, that supersedes sovereignty."

Tariff war: Does Trump actually know what he's doing? | About That

He said those Canadians could be targeted by propaganda campaigns that sell American citizenship as the answer to their economic woes.

"And there will be individuals within Canada who could potentially be co-opted to push that narrative forward," said Bisson.

Trump administration officials have given numerous rationales for the tariffs against Canada, but Trump himself has said that he wants to use economic force to join Canada to the U.S. On Tuesday morning, he again said Canada could only avoid economic ruin through annexation.

"He intends clearly to try and destabilize our economy," said Elcock. "The reality is that if Canada is really impoverished, people may start to think about it. That's always the possibility — that not all Canadians are going to be willing to endure economic deprivation. And so some may start to think about it as time goes along."

Fadden says governments and intelligence agencies have learned the hard way of the power of disinformation and propaganda channelled through social media.

"You keep repeating things often enough, people start believing it," he said. "If it continues down this path for years, virtually anybody can be worn down."

In addition to sending politicians to negotiate with counterparts in Washington, says Fadden, "we need to find a way to play back on the information front."

He says that means finding ways "to use social media more effectively than I believe we have been doing."

Bisson says government assistance for those affected by tariffs could blunt the impact of such propaganda.

"This is the Canadian government trying to shore up that political opinion within their own citizenship to say, 'OK we've got this covered, we're going to take care of you no matter what,'" he said.

"Because if that wasn't done and things were starting to destabilize economically, that would give people even more reason to fall back on thinking, well, maybe it's a better idea if we've just succumbed to this."

The intelligence professionals say it's possible that the U.S. government would use more intrusive tactics, such as fomenting or financing pro-annexationist groups within Canada to create the impression of a groundswell of support for the idea.

"They have an extraordinary capacity to do this," said Fadden. "The real issue to me is whether in respect of Canada, they will actually make use of those capabilities and resources."

He says Canada should be on the lookout. "We need to start at the basics. We need to start monitoring money flows. We need to start talking about whether they're trying to interfere with our elections at all levels."

But he says covert operations on Canadian soil would likely offer the U.S. little return in exchange for a great deal of risk. And Trump is typically his own messenger, preferring the megaphone to the coded message.

"I would argue that the current president's approach is likely to be as effective as using the relatively secret resources of the CIA or the U.S. intelligence community," Fadden said.

The former spy chiefs say U.S. intelligence agencies have rarely operated in Canada in the past, and would need time to develop networks. It would be difficult for them to get very far without alerting the Canadians to their presence, said Elcock.

"Intelligence organizations are out looking for possible threats all the time," he said, and have intelligence "tripwires" set up to help monitor the threat environment.

"The likelihood that the Americans would run afoul of something, like of a tripwire at some point or talk to somebody who then would report it — those things are highly probable," he said.

Intelligence professionals who spoke to CBC News all said that they put some faith in the professionalism of their U.S. counterparts, and their historic attachments to alliances such as Five Eyes and NATO.

Elcock said U.S. agencies would have to worry about their own people talking.

"There is a long relationship between Canada and the United States and there will still be people around who would not necessarily approve. So I don't think they could with any certainty carry out something like that — that wasn't a very, very closely held operation," he said.

But those calculations could change if the Trump administration continues to remove and replace personnel in the agencies down to the managerial and operational level.

"The more you get people who buy into the current U.S. president's philosophy of life," said Fadden, "the more he shifts professionals out of the intelligence community and puts his own people in, the more worrisome it becomes."

As for those Canadians who want to see their country annexed, and have loudly made that case, Elcock says not all should necessarily be seen as a security threat.

"It would depend on what their activities were. There are lots of people who have weird ideas in Canada who don't qualify as a threat to the security of Canada," he said. "Many of those organizations would already be on the radar. So the reality is, if they start to become active, it's not going to be something nobody's aware of."

The experts all said that Canada is a much more resilient target than other countries where the U.S. is known to have conducted destabilization operations, but that doesn't mean it is immune to pressure.

"We need to worry more and talk more about the medium and long term, rather than just worrying about the critically important tariffs that are there now," said Fadden.

He warned if Canada is subjected to a prolonged campaign of economic warfare, then "at some point somebody's going to have to cry uncle."

While Fadden doesn't see a military invasion on the horizon, he said "economic and cultural control of the country can be just as effective."

On Monday morning, about 13 miles off the coast of East Yorkshire, the Solong sailed into the US-registered tanker Stena Immaculate, which was carrying fuel for the US Navy. Fires broke out on board both vessels, 36 people were rescued and one is missing presumed dead.

The arrested captain of the Solong - the container ship involved in the crash in the North Sea - is a Russian national, the vessel's owner has said.

The rest of the crew were Russian and Filipino nationals, according to German shipping company Ernst Russ.

It comes after police said a man had been arrested on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter in connection with Monday's collision.

Humberside Police said a 59-year-old is in custody to allow enquiries to take place, and officers are talking to those involved to find out what happened.

The force added investigators have started a criminal probe into the cause of the collision between the US-registered Stena Immaculate and the Portuguese-flagged Solong about 13 miles off the coast of East Yorkshire on Monday, and are working with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency.

The tanker was carrying Jet-A1 fuel for the US Navy as part of a United States government programme designed to supply American armed forces with fuel when required, a military spokesman told Reuters.

On Monday, maritime security sources told Reuters there was no indication of any malicious activity or other actors involved in the incident and UK authorities have also said they have so far found no evidence of foul play in the crash.

Humberside detectives are working with the UK's Marine Accident Investigation Branch, and it's been reported that authorities from the US and Portugal will lead the investigation into what happened.

The Stena Immaculate, operated by US firm Crowley, was stationary and at anchor while waiting for a berth to become available at the Port of Killingholme, on the River Humber, when it was struck by the smaller Solong, causing huge fires and explosions - the smoke from which was visible from space.

The Solong had been sailing from Grangemouth in Scotland to Rotterdam in the Netherlands at the time. It was initially feared it was carrying sodium cyanide but the German owner Ernst Russ said four containers on the vessel had previously been carrying the chemical.

One missing, presumed dead

One person remains missing and is presumed dead.

In the immediate aftermath of the collision, dozens of people were forced to abandon the vessels as they caught fire.

Coastguard rescued 36 people after the alarm was raised at 9.48am on Monday, with ambulances lining up at a nearby port as emergency services readied their response.

All 23 people on board the oil tanker Stena Immaculate were accounted for, but one of the 14 crew members of the Solong is still missing.

A search for them was called off Monday evening.

Stena Bulk, the owner of the Immaculate, said on Wednesday the 23 members of its crew were all American and in "good health". Crowley said they were staying in Grimsby and being supported.

Ernst Russ said that it's surviving sailors were also being given "every support possible", and that its thought remained with the family of the lost crew member. It thanked all those who had responded.

"Ernst Russ is working with the authorities in the investigations now under way to more fully understand these events and learn from the findings," a statement said.

Solong failed safety checks

It has emerged that the Solong failed steering-related safety checks last year.

Port state control (PSC) inspection documents from July last year show how officials warned that the ship's "emergency steering position communications/compass reading" was "not readable".

It was among 10 issues highlighted during an inspection by Irish officials.

Other issues included the alarms being "inadequate", survival craft not being properly maintained and fire doors "not as required".

Another inspection, this time in Scotland in October 2024, found two issues with the Solong.

One of these was related to lifebuoys, warning they were "not properly marked".

Ernst Russ said in a statement "that all deficiencies that were detected during routine port state control inspections of the Solong back in 2024 were promptly rectified".

Environmental impact not as severe as initially feared

The Stena Immaculate had been carrying 220,000 barrels of jet fuel in 16 segregated cargo tanks - at least one of which "was ruptured" during the collision, shipping company Crowley said.

But it added that the jet fuel spill was having a "limited" impact.

The potential environmental impact seems to be less severe than initially feared.

Most of the spilt jet fuel has evaporated or burned off, Crowley said in an X post. There seems to have been no loss of engine fuel from either vessel and both are expected to remain afloat despite a gaping hole in the side of the Stena Immaculate and earlier fears the Solong would sink.

There are no visible flames on either ship, and the Solong, which was drifting, has now been secured by tugs.

The chief executive for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), Virginia McVea, said on Wednesday morning: "There have been no further reports of pollution to the sea from either vessel beyond what was observed during the initial incident. HM Coastguard's counter pollution and salvage team has a comprehensive counter pollution response in place should it be required. Salvors also have equipment and personnel ready to respond to any pollution.

"The overarching objective is to protect the public and the environment to the best of our ability, during this ongoing incident response.

"This morning's assessment shows the fires on board the [Solong] have greatly reduced in their extent and intensity.

"The Stena Immaculate remains at anchor, with safety tugs in position should they be required. There are no visible flames on board and an on-board assessment may be carried out later today.

"Salvors will only board the vessels when it is safe to do so. Only then will it be possible to carry out comprehensive damage assessments."

US Trade Rep Greer Says EU Retaliation Ignores US National Security Needs

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said on Wednesday that the European Union's retaliation against President Donald Trump's strengthened steel and aluminum tariffs shows that the bloc's trade policies are "out of step with reality."

Greer, in a rare public statement since taking office in late February, said the EU's retaliatory tariffs on 26 billion euros ($28 billion) worth of U.S. goods are contradictory to the bloc's resistance to U.S. efforts to work with the EU to deal with global excess capacity in the metals.

"The EU's punitive action completely disregards the national security imperatives of the United States – and indeed international security – and is yet another indicator that the EU's trade and economic policies are out of step with reality," Greer said.

The U.S. Department of Education is headed for some major changes, with the department cutting its workforce by nearly 50% as the Trump administration proceeds with its plans to dismantle the agency.

President Trump has been expected to issue an executive order directing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to start the process of dissolving the agency, although the timing of such a move is unclear. According to the Education Department, the agency's workforce is being slashed from 4,133 workers to about 2,183. 

The Education Department's workforce cuts are raising questions for millions of parents, students and taxpayers about the future of the agency and how the services it provides will be handled if the agency is dismantled. 

In 1979, President Jimmy Carter signed a bill creating the Department of Education. The agency's key functions include:

The Department of Education is "primarily about ensuring who can access the classroom — it's not so much about what is being talked about in the classroom," Peter Granville, a fellow at The Century Foundation and expert on higher education, told CBS MoneyWatch.

One major misconception held by many Americans is that the Education Department oversees school curriculums and learning, which are instead overseen by states and local school districts. Rather than setting public school curriculums, the Education Department's role is primarily financial, distributing billions in government money to colleges and schools and managing the federal student loan portfolio. 

"Curriculum is handled by states and local governance — the Department of Education has historically had no role in setting curriculum," Granville said. "The primary role of the Department of Education has been as a grant maker and a loan lender."

For instance, the Education Department operates the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, which is used by about 17 million students each year to apply for federal loans, grants and scholarships to attend college or vocational programs. The agency also manages $1.5 trillion in student loans, including repayment programs. 

Additionally, the Education Department handles Title I funding for low-income schools as well as for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Here's what to know about the agency.

Mr. Trump is a vocal critic of the Education Department, describing it last month as "a big con job" and falsely claiming the U.S. is ranked 40th in education internationally but spends the most per pupil. (Spending on K-12 education is largely determined by local school boards and funded by property taxes.)

One of the president's executive orders, signed Jan. 30, directed the Education Department to investigate "school choice programs," saying that parents need "opportunities for students to attend the school that best fits their needs." Vouchers that allow families to pay for private K-12 schools are a priority of conservatives, as such programs allow parents to use tax credits to pay for private schools, including Christian-based institutions.

In an email earlier this month to the agency's staff entitled "Our Department's Final Mission," McMahon wrote that her goal is to "restore the rightful role of state oversight in education and to end the overreach from Washington." That echoes language from Project 2025, the blueprint for a conservative administration written by the Heritage Foundation. 

"Federal money is inevitably accompanied by rules and regulations that keep the influx of funds from having much, if any, impact on student outcomes," Project 2025's section on the Education Department claims. "Eventually, policymaking and funding should take place at the state and local level, closest to the affected families."

Complete elimination of the Education Department would need congressional approval and 60 votes in the Senate, which is unlikely given the current makeup. 

However, the Trump administration could make changes to the agency, such as by cutting staff, without closing the entire department. The Trump administration is currently making massive employment cuts at several other federal agencies, such as the Social Security Administration and Veterans Affairs Department, describing the efforts as a way to reduce federal waste. 

The Trump administration could change some of the department's oversight duties, such as those carried out by its Office for Civil Rights, which issues guidance on how civil rights laws should be applied. Trump has suggested a different interpretation of the office's civil rights role. 

Under his administration, the department has instructed the office to prioritize complaints of antisemitism, and has opened investigations into colleges and school sports leagues for allowing transgender athletes to compete on women's teams, according to the Associated Press.

The Trump administration isn't expected to defend the Biden administration's student loan forgiveness and repayment programs, which have been tied up in court cases, experts say. Last month, the Education Department removed the online application for income-driven repayment plans, according to Business Insider. 

The Education Department manages $1.5 trillion in student loan debt for more than 40 million borrowers. Although the Trump administration hasn't outlined how it might want to reallocate the Education Department's responsibilities, student loans could be moved to the Treasury Department, Granville noted. 

"If this is going to be a smooth handoff, some other agency has to pick up what the Education Department is setting down," he said. "The most logical destination is the Treasury, but I worry about the risk of disruption from any handoff."

Project 2025 posits that student loans should be handled by a "new government corporation with professional governance and management." The blueprint calls for federal loans "to be assigned directly to the Treasury Department, which would manage collections."

Project 2025 also favors phasing out income-based repayment plans, which help borrowers lower their monthly loan payments by making them proportional to their wages and salaries, and creating a new repayment plan that would require people earning above poverty wages to pay 10% of their income toward their loans. 

"[T]here should be no loan forgiveness," Project 2025 states. 

The Education Department required by law to release the FAFSA on or close to Oct. 1, allowing students and their families to apply for loans and other student aid during the college application season. Families must complete the FAFSA each year a student is enrolled in a college program if they wish to qualify for loans or other aid. 

"Congress passed a law that created the FAFSA, and unless Congress creates a new law, the FAFSA has to continue," Granville said.

Still, it's unclear which agency would handle the FAFSA if the Department of Education is dismantled, he added. 

Much of the Education Department's money for K-12 schools is funneled through large federal programs, such as Title I for low-income schools and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Those programs support services for students with disabilities, smaller class sizes with additional teaching positions, and pay for social workers and other non-teaching roles in schools.

During his campaign, Mr. Trump called for shifting those functions to the states. He has not offered details on how the agency's core functions of sending federal money to local districts and schools would be handled.

Project 2025 suggests sending oversight of programs for kids with disabilities and low-income children first to the Department of Health and Human Services, before eventually phasing out the funding and converting it to no-strings-attached grants to states.

There's concern that making massive changes to the Education Department could impact millions of families and students who rely on the agency for loans, grants and other support, experts say. 

Moving some of those tasks to states and local governments could drive up costs for many families, said Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont. 

"That will mean higher local and state taxes to fill the void," Sanders said at a Thursday press conference organized by the Senate Democrats about the potential dismantling of the Education Department. "In other words, shutting down the Department of Education would be a disaster for low income and working class families in every state of our country."

The American Federation of Teachers, a union that represents 1.8 million K-12 teachers, said that it planned to fight the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle the agency. 

"The directive to 'return decision-making to the states' fails the smell test," said AFT President Randi Weingarten in a statement. "States and districts already govern schools through locally elected school boards, as they should. They put up most of the money and control most of the decisions—from approving curriculum to deciding who graduates."

She added, "The Department of Education, and the laws it is supposed to execute, has one major purpose: to level the playing field and fill opportunity gaps to help every child in America succeed."

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is starting another round of job cuts — this one more than 1,000 — at the nation's weather, ocean and fisheries agency, four people familiar with the matter tell The Associated Press.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Tuesday began plans to lay off 10% of its current workforce, people inside and outside the agency said, with some of them requesting anonymity due to fear of retribution. The numbers were presented to NOAA employees and managers were asked to submit names of positions for layoffs to agency headquarters, which will then go to NOAA's parent agency, the Department of Commerce, on Wednesday, the people said.

Three former senior NOAA officials — two former political appointees from the Biden administration — who speak regularly with managers at their old agency used the same number for upcoming job cuts: 1,029, 10% of the current 10,290. They talked to multiple people still in NOAA and a current agency worker detailed the cuts that a manager explained to employees. 

While most people know about NOAA and its daily weather forecasts, the agency also monitors and warns about hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and tsunamis, manages the country's fisheries, runs marine sanctuaries, provides navigation information to ships and observes changes in the climate and oceans. The agency also plays a role in warning about avalanches and space weather that could damage the electrical grid. It helps respond to disasters, including oil spills.

The new cuts come after earlier rounds of Trump administration firings and encouraged retirements at NOAA, plus the elimination of nearly all new employees last month. After this upcoming round of cuts, NOAA will have eliminated about one out of four jobs since President Donald Trump took office in January. 




“This is not government efficiency,” said former NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad. “It is the first steps toward eradication. There is no way to make these kinds of cuts without removing or strongly compromising mission capabilities.”

The cuts are being ordered without specific guidance from the Trump administration on how or where, which makes it even worse, Spinrad said.

NOAA spokeswoman Monica Allen said the agency's policy is not to discuss internal personnel matters, but said NOAA will “continue to provide weather information, forecasts and warnings pursuant to our public safety mission.”

NOAA has already stopped releasing some weather balloons that gather crucial observations for forecasts in two locations — Albany, New York, and Gray, Maine — because of lack of staffing, the agency said last week.

This is all happening as severe storm system is forecast to move through the central and southern parts of the nation late this week in a multi-day outburst with strong tornadoes, hail and damaging winds expected. 

Weather forecasts will worsen and “people are going to start seeing this very quickly,” warned former NOAA chief scientist Craig McLean. It will also limit how much commercial fishermen will be able to catch, he said.

On top of all the job losses, cuts in research grants to universities will also make it harder for the U.S. to keep improving its weather forecasts and better monitor what's happening to the planet, McLean said.

“People are silently watching the United States decline as a technological leader,” McLean said. “America got to the moon, but our weather forecasts won't be the greatest.”

The European Union on Wednesday announced retaliatory trade action with new duties on U.S. industrial and farm products, responding within hours to the Trump administration's increase in tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25 per cent.

The world's biggest trading bloc was expecting the U.S. tariffs and prepared in advance, but the measures still place great strain on already tense transatlantic relations. Only last month, Washington warned Europe that it would have to take care of its own security in the future.

The EU measures will cover goods from the United States worth some 26 billion euros (US$28 billion), and not just steel and aluminum products, but also textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods. Motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans will be hit, as they were during President Donald Trump‘s first term.

The EU duties aim for pressure points in the U.S. while minimizing additional damage to Europe. The tariffs — taxes on imports — primarily target Republican-held states, hitting soybeans in House Speaker Mike Johnson's Louisiana, but also beef and poultry in Kansas and Nebraska. Produce in Alabama, Georgia and Virginia is also on the list.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement that the bloc “will always remain open to negotiation.”

“As the U.S. are applying tariffs worth $28 billion, we are responding with countermeasures worth 26 billion euros,” she said. The commission manages trade and commercial conflicts on behalf of the 27 member EU countries.

“We firmly believe that in a world fraught with geopolitical and economic uncertainties, it is not in our common interest to burden our economies with tariffs,” von der Leyen said.

Trump said his taxes would help create U.S. factory jobs, but von der Leyen said: “Jobs are at stake. Prices will go up. In Europe and in the United States.”

“We deeply regret this measure. Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business, and even worse for consumers. These tariffs are disrupting supply chains. They bring uncertainty for the economy,” she said.

The American Chamber of Commerce to the EU said the U.S. tariffs and EU countermeasures “will only harm jobs, prosperity and security on both sides of the Atlantic.”

“The two sides must de-escalate and find a negotiated outcome urgently,” the chamber said Wednesday.

Trump slapped similar tariffs on EU steel and aluminum during his first term in office, which enraged European and other allies. The EU also imposed countermeasures in retaliation at the time, raising tariffs on U.S.-made motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans, among other items.

This time, the EU action will involve two steps. First, on April 1, the commission will reintroduce what it calls “rebalancing measures,” which the EU had from 2018 and 2020 but which were suspended under the Biden administration. Then on April 13 come the additional duties targeting 18 billion euros (US$19.6 billion) in U.S. exports to the bloc.

EU Trade Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič travelled to Washington last month in an effort to head off the tariffs, meeting with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and other top trade officials.

He said on Wednesday that it became clear during the trip that “the EU is not the problem.”

“I argued to avoid the unnecessary burden of measures and countermeasures, but you need a partner for that. You need both hands to clap,” Šefčovič told reporters at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France.

The EU could lose up to 3.7 million tons of steel exports, according to the European steel association Eurofer. The U.S. is the second biggest export market for EU steel producers, representing 16 per cent of the total EU steel exports.

The EU estimates that annual trade volume between both sides stands at about US$1.5 trillion, representing some 30 per cent of global trade. While the bloc has a substantial export surplus in goods, it says that is partly offset by the U.S. surplus in the trade of services.

Britain, which isn't part of the EU, meanwhile said it won't impose retaliatory measures of its own on the U.S. British Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said Wednesday he would “continue to engage closely and productively with the U.S. to press the case for U.K. business interests.”

He did not rule out future tariffs on U.S. imports, saying “we will keep all options on the table and won't hesitate to respond in the national interest.”

A Russian national was revealed to be the captain of the cargo ship that collided with a U.S. tanker off the coast of England in an incident that sparked a massive fire, spilled jet fuel into the sea and left one person feared dead. 

The 59-year-old man remained in United Kingdom police custody Wednesday after being detained on suspicion of manslaughter by gross negligence, according to Ernst Russ, the owner of the Portugal-flagged Solong cargo ship. It added that the ship's 14 crew members were a mix of Russian and Filipino nationals. One of them remains missing and is presumed dead. 

The Solong collided Monday with MV Stena Immaculate, a U.S.-flagged tanker transporting jet fuel for the American military. U.S.-based Crowley Ship Management said the MV Stena Immaculate was anchored near Hull when it was struck and that all 23 onboard are "safe and accounted for" with no reported injuries. 

Leading up to the collision, the Solong was inspected in Dublin last July and was found to have 10 deficiencies, according to The Associated Press.

Port inspection documents show the Solong failed steering-related safety checks with the vessel's "emergency steering position communications/compass reading" unreadable. It also had "inadequate" alarms, survival craft "not properly maintained" and fire doors "not as required." 

Then a second inspection in Scotland in October found two more deficiencies, but the ship was not detained after either inspection, the AP reported. 

However, U.K. authorities said they do not suspect foul play in the crash.

The 596-foot Stena Immaculate was operating as part of the U.S. government's Tanker Security Program, a group of commercial vessels that can be contracted to carry fuel for the military when needed. 

"Crowley continues to work closely with U.K. agencies to support the incident response, salvage and environmental impact mitigation operations resulting from container ship Solong striking the Crowley-managed tanker Stena Immaculate while at anchor on Monday, March 10," the ship's owner said Tuesday.

"It remains uncertain at this time what volume of fuel may have been released as a result of the incident, but initial review shows impacts have been limited due to exposure to the fire and evaporation of the Jet A1 fuel," Crowley continued. "In addition, U.K. agencies are closely monitoring air quality and any possible public health impacts resulting onshore. Both are currently measuring low or within normal levels."

The Solong was drifting and still on fire Wednesday, but is likely to remain afloat rather than sinking, officials said.

UK Pollution Fears Ease After Cargo Ship Crash, Russian Captain Still in Detention

LONDON (Reuters) - Fears of an environmental disaster eased on Wednesday, two days after a container ship ploughed into a stationary U.S. fuel tanker off northeast England, as the vessel's owner said the detained captain was a Russian national.

The Portuguese-flagged Solong had crashed with no obvious explanation into the larger Stena Immaculate, a tanker carrying jet fuel for the U.S. military.

Huge fires and explosions charred the Solong and left the Immaculate with a gaping hole, but owner Stena Bulk said most of its jet fuel cargo remained intact.

Stena Bulk Chief Executive Erik Hanell said only two of 18 fuel tanks had leaked, or about 10% of the cargo.

"We will have a much clearer picture in the next 24-48 hours on the whole salvage operation," he told Reuters.

Fuel leaked into the sea on Monday, raising fears for protected bird colonies, but the British coastguard said there had been no further reports of pollution from either vessel since then.

Fires on the Solong, which was being held in position by a tug, were greatly reduced on Wednesday, while no flames were visible on the Stena Immaculate, the coastguard said.

MORE:  

British police have arrested Solong's 59-year-old captain on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter.

Ernst Russ, the German company that owns the Solong, confirmed that he was a Russian national. The other 13 crew, one of whom is missing and presumed dead, are Russians and Filipinos.

The West's ties with Russia are under heavy strain over the war in Ukraine, and worries about sabotage of power cables, telecom links and gas pipelines have grown since a string of outages in the Baltic following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Russia's embassy in London did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

Russians account for an estimated 11% of the global seafarer workforce, according to shipping officials.

The Stena Immaculate was at anchor when it was struck, making the collision particularly surprising, given the safety systems that modern vessels carry. But a spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said there is no suggestion of "foul play".

The Stena Immaculate's 23 crew - all U.S. nationals according to Stena Bulk - were evacuated safely.

Maritime safety records suggest minor issues were found when the Solong underwent routine inspections last year, but none justified detaining it.

Ernst Russ said all the deficiencies had been "promptly rectified".

Britain's Marine Accident Investigation Branch will gather initial evidence, but overall responsibility for the investigation lies in the U.S. and Portugal, the ships' flag states.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal investigators looking into the cause of the January collision between a passenger jet and an Army helicopter near Washington, D.C., that killed 67 people recommended a ban on some helicopter flights Tuesday, saying the current setup “poses an intolerable risk.”

National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy laid out frightening statistics about near misses to underscore the danger that has existed for years near Ronald Reagan National Airport and expressed anger that it took a midair collision for it to come to light.

In just over three years, she said, there were 85 close calls when a few feet (meters) in the wrong direction could have resulted in the same kind of accident that happened Jan. 29 when the military helicopter collided with an American Airlines jet over the Potomac River as the plane was approaching the airport.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said he'll adopt the NTSB's recommendations for the route where the midair collision occurred. He noted there will be some modifications in the guidelines to be released Wednesday, including allowing presidential flights and lifesaving missions.

Helicopters no longer will be “threading the needle” flying under landing planes, he said.

The National Transportation Safety Board is recommending a ban on some helicopter flights in the area where a military chopper and a passenger jet collided near Washington, D.C. AP correspondent Donna Warder reports.

The Federal Aviation Administration also will use artificial intelligence to analyze data from every airport to make sure there aren't similar dangers elsewhere, he said, adding that there are other airports with cross-traffic.




Homendy and Duffy both said the hazards at Reagan airport should have been recognized earlier by the FAA.

“The data was there. It wasn't effectively analyzed to see we had this risk,” Duffy said.

The NTSB determined that the existing separation distance between planes and helicopters at Reagan airport is “insufficient and poses an intolerable risk to aviation safety,” Homendy said. 

She said she was devastated for families that are grieving because they lost loved ones. Among the victims were 28 members of the figure skating community.

“It shouldn't take tragedy to require immediate action,” she said.

Members of several families who lost loved ones said in a statement that the NTSB's preliminary report showed this was not an isolated incident.

“It also reinforces what we, as the families of the victims, already suspected: serious, systemic failures in air travel safety cost our loved ones their lives and continues to threaten public safety,” the statement said.

Aviation lawyer Robert Clifford, who represents at least six families, said the airline had a responsibility to address known problems.

“Those charged in transportation with the highest duty of care can't run yellow lights, and they've been running flashing red lights for years, it sounds like, and it's just pathetic,” he said.

Under current practice helicopters and planes can be as close as 75 feet (23 meters) apart from each other during landing, Homendy said. Investigators have identified 15,000 instances of planes getting alerts about helicopters being in close proximity between October 2021 and December 2024, she said.

Investigators determined that planes got serious alerts to take evasive action because they were too close to a helicopter at least once a month between October 2011 and December 2024, Homendy said. In over half those instances, the helicopter may have been above its established altitude restriction for the route.

Safety advocate Mary Schiavo, a former Inspector General of the U.S. Transportation Department, called it a “shocking dereliction of duty” for the FAA to have failed to act on data the NTSB gathered in just a few weeks since the crash. She noted that the FAA had pledged to warn pilots about places with higher collision risk.

“They were going to really be proactive to warn pilots about these hotspots. I mean, this is beyond a hotspot,” Schiavo said. “This is absolutely radioactive, to have 15,214 close proximity events in three years, it's unbelievable.”

Following the midair collision, the FAA took steps to restrict helicopter flights around the airport to ensure that planes and helicopters are no longer sharing the same airspace. Now flights are put on hold temporarily when helicopters need to pass by.

The NTSB's proposal would close a vital route for law enforcement, Coast Guard patrols and government operations flights at times, but only when the runways in question are in use, and they account for only about 5% of flights at Reagan.

Homendy said the NTSB is recommending that the FAA find a “permanent solution” for alternate routes farther away for helicopter traffic.

Investigators have said the helicopter may have had inaccurate altitude readings in the moments before the crash, and the crew may not have heard key instructions from air traffic controllers. The radio altitude of the helicopter was 278 feet (85 meters), which would put it above its 200-foot (61-meter) limit for the location. 

The helicopter pilots may have also missed part of another communication, when the tower said the jet was turning toward a different runway, Homendy said last month. And the crew was wearing night-vision goggles that would have limited their peripheral vision.

The Black Hawk crew was made up of an instructor pilot with 968 hours of flight experience, a pilot with about 450 and a crew chief with nearly 1,150. Army officials have said the crew was familiar with the crowded skies around Washington.

The NTSB in its ongoing investigation will look at the amount of traffic at Reagan and the staffing in the control tower to determine if either of those factors played a role. It will take more than a year to get the final NTSB report.

Aviation safety expert John Cox said he piloted in and out of Reagan in all different kinds of planes since the late 1970s and sometimes received collision alerts about helicopters, but it was usually easy to see that they were going to pass behind him.

“That's just something that occurred going in and out of there, and it worked successfully for decades,” said Cox, who is CEO of aviation safety consulting firm Safety Operating Systems in St. Petersburg, Florida.

Multiple things had to go wrong for this collision to happen, he added.

Within just a month's time earlier this year, there were four major aviation disasters in North America, most recently in mid-February when a Delta flight flipped and landed on its roof at Toronto's Pearson Airport, injuring 21 people. 

Those accidents and close calls left some worried about the safety of flying, though fatal crashes are rare and U.S. airlines' track record is remarkably sound.

President Donald Trump blamed the midair collision on what he called an “obsolete” air traffic control system and promised to replace it. He also faulted the helicopter for flying too high. 

Federal officials have been raising concerns about an overtaxed and understaffed air traffic control system for years, especially after a series of close calls at airports. 

Doug Lane, whose wife Christine Conrad Lane, and their 16-year-old son Spencer, died in the crash, said Tuesday he hopes the way the near-misses are reported gets a closer look and that NTSB recommendations will be implemented.

“If we're going to invest in an organization like this, it needs to be outfitted with state of the art technology and given staffing at a level that's going to set them up for success,” Lane said.

Duffy said Tuesday that he will present an expensive plan to Congress within the next few weeks to overhaul the system with new technology. He hopes to complete it within four years.

Governor Tiff Macklem warns the economic impact of Trump's trade war could be severe

The Bank of Canada cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday, citing trade uncertainty with the U.S. for the decision.

“In recent months, the pervasive uncertainty created by continuously changing U.S. tariff threats has shaken business and consumer confidence,” said Bank of Canada governor Tiff Macklem, during opening remarks in Ottawa. “This is restraining household spending intentions and businesses' plans to hire and invest.”

The decision to cut for the seventh consecutive time on Wednesday was largely expected by markets and economists and brings the central bank's overnight rate down to 2.75 per cent, in the middle of the bank's estimated neutral range.

“Depending on the extent and duration of new U.S. tariffs, the economic impact could be severe,” said Macklem.



The central bank estimates a protracted trade war could knock three per cent off Canada's growth over the next two years. The bank also estimates investment in Canada could decline by 12 per cent and exports could decrease by 8.5 per cent after the first year.

Macklem added that the “uncertainty alone is already causing harm.”

The central bank also published the results of surveys with businesses and consumers on Wednesday, which show how business and household spending sentiment has shifted.

Around 72 per cent of consumers expect costs to go up as a result of tariffs and 47 per cent of businesses think the same, according to a survey conducted between Jan. 29 and Feb. 28.



Around 48 per cent of businesses surveyed plan to reduce their investment plans and 40 per cent plan to pull back on hiring, with just two per cent of businesses saying they will increase investment.

Macklem said he expects some rise in the unemployment rate, if business investment continues to weaken in the second quarter of this year.

“Our surveys also suggest business intentions to raise prices have increased as they cope with higher costs related to both uncertainty and tariffs,” said Macklem. “At the same time, inflation expectations have moved up as Canadians brace for the possibility of higher prices.”

The bank expects inflation to rise to 2.5 per cent in March, after the end of the GST/HST federal tax break.

Macklem said the impact of tariffs on inflation will be more difficult to assess and will include a number of factors such as a weakening Canadian dollar, the cost of retaliatory tariffs and a pullback in household spending and business confidence.

The central bank said it will continue to monitor inflation expectations closely and how quickly costs incurred by businesses are being passed through to prices.

“The reality is that some prices are going to go up, we can't change that,” said Macklem. “What we don't want to see … that first round of price increases have knock-on effects causing other prices to go up, that becoming generalized and ongoing inflation. That's what we can't let happen.”

The bank said it will not be able to provide forward guidance given the uncertainty, a decision made during the last announcement in January. It also said the governing council will be “carefully assessing the timing and strength” of downward pressures on inflation from weaker growth and upward pressures on inflation from higher costs.

Randall Bartlett, deputy chief economist at Desjardins Group, said the market reaction following the announcement on Wednesday suggests an April cut is “no slam dunk.”

Tony Stillo and Michael Davenport, economists at Oxford Economics Canada, think the Bank of Canada could cut its policy rate a few more times this year, but will not go below the neutral range.

“We can't entirely rule out a couple more 25-basis-points rate cuts to cushion against the negative impacts of ongoing uncertainty, but we think it's very unlikely the bank will lower rates below the bottom-end of its 2.25 per cent-3.25 per cent neutral range estimate given the ongoing U.S.-Canada trade war,” they wrote in a note.

Oops, something went wrong

Intel (INTC) stock climbed higher Wednesday on a report that rival Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is in talks with a group of chipmakers, including Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD), that would run Intel's chip manufacturing business.

According to Reuters, the consortium, which would also include Broadcom (AVGO), would take over Intel's foundry business, which is responsible for building chips for both Intel and third-party contractors. Intel reported a net loss of $18.8 billion in 2024; the foundry segment saw a total operating income loss of $11.6 billion on the year.

Shares of Intel were up roughly 3% in afternoon trading following the report and are up 1.6% year to date. Zoom out further, however, and Intel's stock price is down 54% over the past 12 months.

AI chip giant Nvidia's stock price is off 14% year to date on concerns that the AI trade has run its course and that tariffs and export controls will handicap the company's sales moving forward. Still, Nvidia shares are up 24% over the past year.

Shares of TSMC, Broadcom, and Nvidia rose on the news.

Intel had no comment on the report.

The moves come as the Trump administration works to guarantee the future of Intel's chip-building business in the US. While Intel is the country's largest chip manufacturer, the US accounts for only 12% of the world's chip production, down from 37% in 1990.

Those declines came into stark relief during the COVID-19 pandemic, when chip shortages impacted everything from consumer electronics to automotive sales. US officials have also raised concerns about the potential for geopolitical conflict, including fears that China could invade Taiwan, and natural disasters disrupting chip shipments to the US, which could dramatically impact large swaths of the economy.

The Trump administration has previously pushed for TSMC to buy up part of Intel's business in the hopes of propping it up over the long term.

Former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger tried to spin up the company's foundry segment into a third-party chip manufacturer to rival TSMC's own semiconductor fabrication business.

But the effort has been slow going so far, and Intel's board ousted Gelsinger last year. Co-CEOs David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus are currently steering the ship until the board finds Gelsinger's permanent replacement.

Both Intel and TSMC have received billions of dollars via the CHIPS Act to help them pay for new manufacturing facilities in the US. On March 3, TSMC said it would invest $100 billion to build new plants in Arizona in addition to the $65 billion it already earmarked for the region.

Intel is also constructing new plants in the US, including a massive campus in Ohio, but recently announced that part of the project is delayed and won't be completed until 2030. It was initially slated to open in 2025.

The Bank of Canada has cut its overnight lending rate by 25 basis points to 2.75 per cent, it announced on Wednesday, as an ongoing trade war with the U.S. begins to strain the Canadian economy.

Explaining the decision in his opening remarks, Bank of Canada governor Tiff Macklem said the economy started the year strong, with solid GDP growth and inflation within its two per cent target.

But tariff uncertainty caused by the on-again, off-again trade war between Canada and the U.S. has weighed on business spending and hiring, and shaken consumer confidence, he said. Manufacturing businesses in particular have lowered their sales outlooks.

It's "against this backdrop" that the central bank decided to cut the rate by a quarter point, according to Macklem, though he added that a surge in exports ahead of the tariffs might offset a slowdown in growth.

"While it is still too early to see much impact of new tariffs on economic activity, our surveys suggest that threats of new tariffs and uncertainty about the Canada-U.S. trade relationship are already having a big impact on business and consumer intentions," he said during his Wednesday news conference.

Bank of Canada cuts key rate, cites 'pervasive uncertainty' of U.S. tariff threats

It's the seventh consecutive cut the Bank has made since it started bringing rates down in June 2024.

"They're clearly worried that an economy that was otherwise in pretty good shape and wouldn't have needed a rate cut now needs this one, and perhaps more, given the potential shock from higher tariffs and what that's going to do to the Canadian economy in the near term," said Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC.

The bank's internal research shows that Canadian businesses intend to raise prices to offset the impact of tariffs. As Macklem noted, less spending by businesses and consumers tends to put downward pressure on inflation. But rising costs could trigger it.

"We're now facing a new crisis. Depending on the extent and duration of new U.S. tariffs, the economic impact could be severe. The uncertainty alone is already causing harm," he said on Wednesday.

Macklem has warned in the past that the bank cannot shield the Canadian economy from the financial impact of tariffs, but that it can instead use interest rates to manage a potential surge in inflation.

Tiff Macklem outlines what tariffs could mean for inflation in Canada

Meanwhile, the bank's preferred measures of core inflation are still above two per cent, mainly driven by housing-related price growth, adding to its concerns.

Asked what kind of inflationary impacts Canada faces, Macklem said during the Q&A with reporters that "given the pervasive uncertainty and unpredictability of U.S. trade policy, I can't put a number on it."

Several factors could contribute to inflation, he said. The weak Canadian dollar poses a challenge to importers, because it means the products they bring in will be more expensive; retaliatory tariffs imposed by Canada will also add costs; and uncertainty itself adds costs, because businesses are looking for new suppliers and new markets to sustain themselves.

"Somebody has to pay for these costs and, ultimately, they get passed to the consumer," he explained. "What we can do is ensure that any rise in inflation is temporary." 

As one reporter pointed out, Macklem never used the word recession in his remarks, which some economists have said is a likely outcome given that tariffs will hamper growth.

As for whether a recession is imminent, deputy governor Carolyn Rogers said the bank doesn't have a forecast at this point. "All of those things don't bode well for growth, but we'll see," she said.

The Bank of Canada's next interest rate meeting is on April 16, at which point it will also release its quarterly monetary policy report to assess the outlook for the Canadian economy.

BMO chief economist Douglas Porter wrote in a note to clients that any future interest rate decisions "will be largely guided by the direction of travel in the trade war, although we suspect the Bank was headed a bit lower in any event."

"Our core assumption is that Canada will be facing some serious tariffs for an extended period of time and that the growth dampening aspects of the trade war will ultimately outweigh the upside inflationary impact, keeping the Bank in easing mode," Porter wrote.

He expects the Bank will make a 25 basis point cut at each of its next three meetings, bringing the overnight lending rate to two per cent.

The Federal Trade Commission asked a judge in Seattle to delay the start of its trial accusing Amazon of duping consumers into signing up for its Prime program, citing resource constraints.

Attorneys for the FTC made the request during a status hearing on Wednesday before Judge John Chun in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. Chun had set a Sept. 22 start date for the trial.

Jonathan Cohen, an attorney for the FTC, asked Chun for a two-month continuance on the case due to staffing and budgetary shortfalls.

The FTC's request comes amid a push by the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency to reduce spending. DOGE, which is led by tech baron Elon Musk, has slashed the federal government's workforce by more than 62,000 workers in February alone.

"We have lost employees in the agency, in our division and on our case team," Cohen said.

Chun asked Cohen how the FTC's situation "will be different in two months" if the agency is "in crisis now, as far as resources." Cohen responded by saying that he "cannot guarantee if things won't be even worse." He pointed to the possibility that the FTC may have to move to another office "unexpectedly," which could hamper its ability to prepare for the trial.

"But there's a lot of reason to believe ... we may have been through the brunt of it, at least for a little while," Cohen said.

John Hueston, an attorney for Amazon, disputed Cohen's request to push back the trial date.

"There has been no showing on this call that the government does not have the resources to proceed to trial with the trial date as presently set," Hueston said. "What I heard is that they've got the whole trial team still intact. Maybe there's going to be an office move. And by the way, both in government and private sector, I've never heard of an office move being more than a few days disruptive."

The FTC sued Amazon in June 2023, alleging that the online retailer was deceiving millions of customers into signing up for its Prime program and sabotaging their attempts to cancel it. Amazon has denied any wrongdoing, calling the FTC's claims "wrong on the facts and the law."

"Amazon tricked and trapped people into recurring subscriptions without their consent, not only frustrating users but also costing them significant money," former FTC Chair Lina Khan said at the time.

The FTC brought a separate case against Amazon in September 2023 accusing it of wielding an illegal monopoly. The agency alleged that Amazon prevents sellers from offering cheaper prices elsewhere through its anti-discounting measures. That case is set to go to trial in October 2026.

In the time since the FTC filed its cases, Khan has been replaced as the head of the FTC by Trump appointee Andrew Ferguson. Tech companies, which are the target of several regulatory agencies, have sought to curry favor with Trump, including Amazon founder and executive chairman Jeff Bezos. He attended President Donald Trump's inauguration in January, and Amazon was among several tech companies to donate $1 million to Trump's inauguration committee.

Uncertainty about the global economy and Trump's tariff plans have triggered a sell-off in the US stock market.

And with this volatility in markets, strategists at BNP Paribas expect gold to be a beneficiary amid what it calls "Trump tariff chaos and geopolitical shifts."

In a note to clients on Wednesday, BNP senior commodity strategist David Wilson said the firm expects gold prices to breach $3,000 per ounce for the first time and ultimately reach $3,100 in the coming months.

"The Trump administration issuing a slew of tariff threats and the realigning of international relationships have added a new layer of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, providing a significant boost to gold," Wilson wrote in a note on Wednesday.

BNP's strategists raised their average 2025 forecast average by 8%, with prices expected to push above $3,100 per ounce during the second quarter of 2025, noting tariff fears have "dramatically" tightened the physical gold market.

On Wednesday, gold futures (GC=F) rose above $2,940 per ounce as US tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from all countries took effect. Canada and the EU have responded with reciprocal tariffs.

"Physical tightness due to the surge in demand for moving gold into the US ahead of tariffs, a pick-up in central bank buying and an acceleration in physically-backed ETF gold demand have been key YTD gold price supportive factors, and we expect this to continue through 2025," Wilson wrote.

However, Wilson forecasts that in the second half of 2025, "the gold market will price in or normalize" Trump-driven trade risks.

The strategist argues that without an ongoing escalation in trade tensions, gold prices will struggle to maintain further upside momentum in the second half of the year.

Gold futures have rallied more than 12% year to date, hitting multiple record highs since January.

Wall Street has attributed much of these gains to continued central bank buying and tariff uncertainty, including the possibility that even imports of the precious metal into the US won't be spared.

Institutional investors have shipped elevated amounts of physical gold bars to vaults in New York in a move to front-run tariffs and take advantage of a price disparity between London and New York.

Last month, Goldman Sachs analysts raised their year-end gold price forecast to $3,100 per ounce, up from their prior projection of $2,890.

Over the past year, the safe-haven asset has handily outperformed the US stock market, with the price of an ounce of gold rising more than 35% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) has gained just over 8% in that period.

Oops, something went wrong

Elon Musk made good on his promise to appeal a controversial decision by a Delaware judge who wiped out his $56 billion performance-based compensation plan as the Tesla (TSLA) CEO leads a revolt that is roiling that state's politics.

The billionaire, along with current and former Tesla directors, argued in an appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court on Tuesday that a refusal by Delaware Chancery Court judge Kathaleen McCormick to reinstate Musk's pay despite approvals from Tesla shareholders contained multiple errors that should lead to the ruling's reversal.

"Yes, Tesla has a chance" to succeed with its new appeal, said Tulane University law professor Ann Lipton. But “the situation is complicated by the fact that the entire decision has turned into a political football."

McCormick initially voided the pay pact in January 2024 and did so for a second time last December based on the claims of a single shareholder who alleged in a purported class-action lawsuit that Musk's influence over Tesla made him a de facto controller of Tesla.

McCormick concluded that "extensive ties" between Musk and the people negotiating the pay package and a lack of public disclosure about Musk's relationships with those who approved the deal made it invalid under Delaware's corporate laws.

Musk responded by pledging to pull the incorporations of his many companies, including Tesla, out of Delaware.

These so-called "Dexits" were followed by decisions from executives at other companies to reincorporate elsewhere, including Bill Ackman's hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, as some aired their frustrations with Delaware's powerful Chancery Court.

The recent high-profile departures are roiling a state that, for roughly the past century, has been the dominant place to incorporate because of its so-called corporate-friendly laws, specialized business courts, and ease of filing company documents.

The state's newly elected governor, Matt Meyer, launched a working group to study mounting complaints, and lawmakers are trying to push through a bill that would limit investor lawsuits by allowing corporate boards to further insulate their directors, officers, and controlling shareholders from liability.

The measure is not retroactive and, therefore, wouldn't absolve Musk or other litigants from past determinations.

Semafor reported last week that the legislation was prompted by warnings from key corporate attorneys that big-name companies, including Walmart (WMT), might move out of the state.

The political drama in Delaware could play a role in what the state's highest court decides to do about Musk's pay.

Lipton, the Tulane professor, cited the many complications: "Musk attacking the Delaware courts, his allies threatening to leave the state, and the state legislature on the verge of passing a new statute that reads like a direct rebuke to the Delaware courts.”

“It's not clear to me whether that's likely to influence the Delaware Supreme Court — in either direction,” she added.

What Musk and the Tesla directors are arguing in their appeal is that the lower court applied the wrong, heightened legal test to evaluate actions taken by Tesla's board around the compensation plan.

They said McCormick incorrectly subjected the board's actions to the “entire fairness” standard, then misapplied it. That standard is applied to protect shareholders when a controlling shareholder negotiates a self-interested deal with the board.

Musk's status as a limited minority stockholder at the time of the negotiations, they said, should not have led to his designation as a controlling shareholder.

New York University School of Law professor Marcel Kahan said the Supreme Court will decide what particular issues to address in the case and he suspects that it will want to clarify the definition of "controlling shareholder."

That matter is now the subject of the controversial proposed legislation in Delaware to amend the state's corporate law. The proposed changes would exempt shareholders with less than 33.3% ownership.

"My guess is the court will want to put its five cents in on 'controller creep,'" Kahan said, referring to the court's expansion of circumstances that can subject a shareholder to "controller" status.

"I would not at all be surprised if the court comes to a different finding on whether Musk is a controlling shareholder than the Chancery court," Kahan added.

Musk and the Tesla directors are also arguing that McCormick's invalidation of a second Tesla shareholder vote about Musk's compensation constituted yet another error because the vote showed that the electric vehicle company's shareholders “resoundingly rejected” her initial finding that Musk was overpaid.

The fact that Tesla stockholders have since received a return of more than $700 billion on their investment in Musk, they said, shows the compensation plan exemplified alignment between executive and stockholder interests.

With McCormick's decision, shareholders "have lost their say in compensating the company's once-in-a-generation CEO" and "lost certainty in the company they own."

"The bottom line of the Court of Chancery's decisions is that a compensation plan resulting in spectacular growth should be revoked because it was somehow unfair to the very stockholders who benefited from that growth and overwhelmingly approved the plan — twice."

For Musk to keep his $56 billion, said Kahan of New York University, the court would have to reverse both McCormick's finding that Musk was a controlling shareholder at the time he negotiated his pay deal with Tesla's board and her finding that the shareholder revote failed to “cleanse” — take steps to legally validate — the flawed transaction.

As for cleansing, he said, "I can see the court saying, 'You were a little too tough here.'" Cleansing solely shifts the burden of proving whether $56 billion was fair from the defendants to the plaintiffs.

"If $56 billion is too high, it doesn't follow that zero is the right amount, right? Zero may be too low."

In that case, the court could send the case back to the lower court and instruct it to pick an amount of fair compensation.

More than eight out of every 10 respondents to a Morgan Stanley survey believe Tesla CEO Elon Musk's controversial political activities are hurting his business.

In total, 85% of the 245 participants polled by the firm believe Musk's foray into politics has either had a "negative" or "extremely negative" impact on business fundamentals. The majority of respondents also expect Tesla deliveries to fall this year, according to the survey.

While a small sampling, these results offer the latest sign of mounting frustration with the billionaire entrepreneur as he's become a rising figure in international and American politics. It also comes at a pivotal point for Tesla's stock, with shares plunging nearly 40% this year.

When asked about Musk's efforts with U.S. government efficiency and other political activities, 45% of respondents said these actions had a "negative" effect on the company. Another 40% said they were having an "extremely negative" impact.

On the other hand, 3% said they were "positive" for the business. Meanwhile, 12% called them "insignificant."

To be sure, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas reported that his survey respondents are drawn from his email distribution list and should not be taken as a random representative sample. He also noted that the respondents are not necessarily owners of Tesla stock. The survey was taken over a 17-hour period, starting on Tuesday afternoon.

Jonas also asked about expectations for the company's performance. In a separate question, 59% said they anticipated Tesla would deliver fewer cars to customers in 2025 compared with the prior year. What's more, 21% of total respondents said they expected a decline of more than 10%. That comes as some analysts have raised alarm that recent reports of vandalism could spook potential customers.

Just 19% of responders said they forecasted deliveries to rise in 2025, while another 23% said they would be flat between the two years.

Musk's political profile has grown after his public support of President Donald Trump in the runup up to last year's election and his subsequent role leading the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The Tesla executive's efforts to slash the federal government's spending and workforce has drawn the ire of critics who see his team as working too quickly and haphazardly.

Musk acknowledged in an interview with Fox Business on Monday that his high-profile role in Trump's administration meant he was running his businesses, which also include X and SpaceX, "with great difficulty." That day, Tesla shares tumbled more than 15% for their worst session since 2020.

Despite the recent nosedive, 45% of respondents said they anticipate Tesla shares will be at least 11% higher by the end of the calendar year. Around 36% expect the stock to tumble another 11% or further by year-end, while 19% see the stock staying within 10% of its price around $220.

After a New York Times report last week unearthed criticisms of Musk's team from members of Trump's cabinet, the president offered a vote of confidence on Tuesday. Trump evaluated five Tesla vehicles parked at the White House after the president said on social media that he would buy one as a symbol of support.

Trump also said he would declare violence at Tesla dealerships to be acts of domestic terrorism.

Verizon Business takes first-of-its-kind approach to network-native security for business with end-to-end solution that can be embedded in customer networks

NEW YORK — Businesses of all sizes can now bolster cybersecurity along the complete digital pathway from their connected devices through their IT networks all the way to cloud-hosted SaaS applications with Trusted Connection, a new cybersecurity solution from Verizon Business. Instead of simply forming a secure perimeter around your digital landscape, Trusted Connection secures the connection and endpoints from any user device to any digital resource, spanning web/cloud, SaaS, private apps and more.

Trusted Connection is particularly suitable for larger midsize businesses that need enhanced security but don't have the resources or dedicated expertise to install and run it themselves, or for enterprises looking to simplify the management of their security.

“Having the right cybersecurity architecture in place is one of the most important responsibilities technology decision-makers face. Ensuring end-to-end security is critical,” said Kyle Malady, CEO, Verizon Business. “If a perimeter is breached, bad actors can wreak havoc. Trusted Connection creates a protected environment within the outer walls of security, protecting each specific entry point and pathway that could lead a bad actor to a valuable digital asset. It's sophisticated security technology combined with an ease of use that makes cybersecurity accessible to businesses of all sizes.”

“Cloud-related security is an urgent and escalating problem, but few enterprises have the resources to keep safe in real time as exploitable technologies gain ground. The service can dramatically reduce attack surface by encrypting paths between cloud and endpoint.” said Camille Mendler, Chief Analyst, Service Provider Enterprise, Omdia. “Trusted Connection's seamless network-native security offers a huge step forward in functionality and control -- especially for mid-sized companies that face similar threats as large enterprises but often lack the resources to address quickly evolving security threats comprehensively.”

According to the 2024 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report, 77% of basic web application attacks and 31% of all breaches in the past 10 years involved the use of stolen credentials. Trusted Connection can help contain the negative impacts of stolen credentials by enforcing ZTNA on network connections, checking device security posture, providing access from a managed device and by enforcing multi-factor authentication on access as designated by administrators.

The Trump administration raised tariffs on global steel and aluminum imports to 25% Wednesday as President Donald Trump and his administration dig in on trade policies that have rocked financial markets.

Allies of the U.S., such as the European Union, responded in kind with a hail of criticism and reciprocal tariffs. The EU announced retaliatory tariffs early Wednesday on $28 billion-worth of a wide range of U.S. goods imported to Europe such as boats, motorbikes and alcohol. 

President Trump announced the tariffs last month and the White House said Wednesday that there would be no exceptions. 

“President Trump has once again used the leverage of the American economy, which is the best and biggest in the world, to deliver a win for the American people,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement.

Calling the new U.S. tariffs “unjustified,” the European Commission said that the levies would kick in on April 1, with additional countermeasures introduced in mid-April. 

Investors appeared unfazed as they sent U.S. stock futures higher in advance of the release of the latest Consumer Price Index report Wednesday, though major stock indexes remain sharply lower in recent weeks. The S&P 500 is down almost 9% from its February high, putting it in correction territory.

While President Trump has suggested he wants to negotiate a broader trade agreement with the U.K., Britain did not escape the taxes. U.K. business and trade secretary Jonathan Reynolds called the levies “disappointing,” but said his country was “focused on a pragmatic approach” and negotiating a broader deal.

The European reaction echoed that of Canada, another of America's traditional close allies and trading partners, on which Trump had already imposed a 25% metals tax.

New tariffs were briefly expected to go even higher for Canada, the top U.S. export market. President Donald Trump said Tuesday they would jump to 50% in response to Ontario Premier Doug Ford's threat to impose a 25% surcharge on electricity imports into the United States to match the initial U.S. hike.

A conversation between Ford and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, prevented this though, with Trump indicating a doubling of U.S. tariffs for Canada was no longer likely.

In a joint-statement with Lutnick posted on X, Ford said they would meet Thursday alongside the U.S. trade representative to discuss renewing the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade act.

In a Truth Social post Monday, Trump called Canada a longtime “tariff abuser,” going beyond his metals threats to say that “The United States is not going to be subsidizing Canada any longer,” and that “We don't need your Cars, we don't need your Lumber, we don't your Energy, and very soon, you will find that out.”

Other long-time U.S. allies also failed to escape. 

Australia, which had been hoping for the same exemption from steel and aluminum tariffs it received during the first Trump administration, said it would not retaliate.

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the tariff “entirely unjustified,” but added that imposing reciprocal tariffs “would only push up prices for Australian consumers,” and that Australia would impose no new tariffs on U.S. goods.

Perhaps the sharpest response came from China, the world's largest steel producer and second-largest economy, which had already been slapped with a 20% blanket tariff on Trump's return to office, and announced new tariffs in return. 

Beijing's foreign ministry accused the U.S. of violating World Trade Organization rules and said it would take “all necessary measures” to protect its rights and interests. 

“No one wins in a trade war or a tariff war, a view widely shared by the international community,” spokesperson Mao Ning said at a media briefing.

America's Asian allies in South Korea and Japan — both are major steel producers — were also hit. 

South Korea, which Trump singled out in his address to Congress last week over its tariff policies, is scrambling to minimize the impact of U.S. tariffs on its domestic industries. Trade Minister Cheong In-kyo's office said Wednesday he will be in Washington for two days starting Thursday for tariff discussions.

Yoshimasa Hayashi, the Japanese government's top spokesperson, told reporters in Tokyo it was “regrettable” that the new U.S. tariffs had been imposed “without excluding Japan.”

Stock market investors have made their feelings about the tariffs clear, with major indexes plunging on Trump's earlier tariff threats, before rallying on the suspension announcement for Canada.

Pre-market futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq all inched higher early Wednesday after plunging in recent days. 

Aside from steel and aluminum, Trump on Tuesday called on Canada to drop its duties on U.S. dairy products and threatened to "substantially increase" tariffs on cars imported into the United States if Canada did not drop "other egregious, long time tariffs."

The auto tariffs, Trump warned, without citing evidence, “essentially, permanently shut down the automobile manufacturing business in Canada.” He also doubled down on some of his recent rhetoric about making Canada part of the United States.

Canada has quickly emerged as a target of Trump's ire in his second term. Trump this month instituted, then pulled back, tariffs on a variety of Canadian goods as he goaded its leaders and blamed them for a lack of action on fentanyl trafficking. 

Relatively little of the drug is seized at the U.S.'s northern border compared with that with Mexico.

While Mexico has faced similar tariff threats and rhetoric, its president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has succeeded in assuaging Trump.

Newly appointed Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney subsequently called Trump's threats "an attack on Canadian workers, families and businesses."

He said Canadian tariffs on U.S. goods would remain "until the Americans show us respect and make credible, reliable commitments to free and fair trade."

Morgan Stanley analysts warned that because the United States is a net importer of steel and aluminum from Canada, the tariffs would lead to higher domestic prices.

The union positioned the two sides as being "frustratingly far apart" at the negotiating table in an update to members on Tuesday.


							By 

	Katie Kilkenny


Labor & Media Reporter


SAG-AFTRA has been on strike against major video game studios for more than seven months, and the two sides don't seem to be particularly close to making a deal.


	That's the impression that negotiators for the performers union gave to members in a message on Tuesday that warned that the companies' latest proposals contained “alarming loopholes that will leave our members vulnerable to AI abuse” — the very issue that prompted the union's current work stoppage in the first place.




	The memo, which contained a link to a chart showing the alleged gap between the union's and the employer's recent proposals on AI, claimed that the labor group is “frustratingly far apart” in its proposals from the video game studios, though the message said the studios might claim otherwise.

	A spokesperson for the companies that are negotiating the Interactive Media Agreement with the union stated that their deal proposal contains “wage increases of over 15% for SAG-AFTRA represented performers in video games, as well as enhanced health and safety protections, industry-leading terms of use for AI digital replicas in-game and additional compensation for the use of an actor's performance in other games.” The spokesperson added that the two sides have made “meaningful progress” and the companies are eager to return to the bargaining table.

	The firms currently in negotiations with SAG-AFTRA include Disney Character Voices, Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Warner Bros. Games, Insomniac Games and others. In October, that bargaining group stated that the two sides had reached tentative agreements on “24 out of 25 proposals.” 


	Nevertheless, SAG-AFTRA national executive director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland and Interactive Media negotiating chair Sarah Elmaleh wrote to members on Tuesday that the employers' last proposals would allow studios to use union members' past performances and outside performances “without any of the protections being bargained at all.” The negotiators also alleged that the studios' proposals would not require them to disclose how they used a digital replica after a performer has given their consent for how it can be used.


	With its chart, the union showed that it is attempting to negotiate specific AI language — provisions, for instance, that end performers' consent for use of their digital replica during a strike, that require additional reports from the studios regarding their use of digital replicas and that necessitate employer disclosure of whether a performer's voice will be combined with any other voices in a digital replica or whether it will be used for any kind of generative AI chatbot.

	











	The chart also demonstrates that the two parties have reached provisional deals on some issues: They have agreed to mandating that actors give their consent for digital replicas made using their performances and agreed on the amount of information that performers will receive about how their digital replicas are intended to be used in employment contracts. The labor and employer sides have also   been in accord on certain ways that performers can be compensated for their digital replicas, but have not resolved all their differences on payment.


	In its Tuesday message, the union also implored performers who don't usually work in video games to reject any jobs offered by struck companies. “If you're approached for such a role, we urge you to seriously consider the consequences. Not only would you be undermining the efforts of your fellow members, but you would be putting yourself at risk by working without protections against A.I. misuse,” the negotiators wrote.


	Nearly two years into their long-running negotiations with video game studios, SAG-AFTRA called a strike against those companies in July 2024. Negotiations have taken place in starts and stops ever since, with union performers occasionally picketing struck companies. The labor group's latest demonstration, at Disney Character Voices in Burbank, will take place on March 18.

Australia Won't Retaliate Against 'Unjustified' US Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum

MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Wednesday that U.S. tariffs on Australian steel and aluminum were unjustified, but his government would not retaliate with its own tariffs.

U.S. President Donald Trump said last month he was considering a tariff exemption for Australia, a free trade treaty partner that has traded with the United States at a deficit for decades.

A former Australian government secured an exemption with the previous Trump administration in 2018 based on arguments including that Australian steelmaker BlueScope employs thousands of workers in the U.S.

Albanese said he would continue to pursue an Australian exemption. The 2018 exemption took several months to secure.

“It has been foreshadowed that no country regardless of its relationship with the United States has been granted an exemption. Such a decision by the Trump administration is entirely unjustified,” Albanese said.

“Tariffs and escalating trade tensions are a form of economic self-harm and a recipe for slower growth and higher inflation. They are paid by the consumers. This is why Australia will not be imposing reciprocal tariffs on the United States,” Albanese added.

The U.S. officially increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25% on Wednesday.

The U.S. decision not to exempt Australia was announced days after a spat became public between Trump and the former Australian prime minister who secured the 2018 exemption, Malcolm Turnbull.

Trump described Turnbull, who quit politics in 2018 after being overthrown as prime minister by his own government, as a weak and ineffective leader.

“Malcolm Turnbull, the former Prime Minister of Australia who was always leading that wonderful country from 'behind', never understood what was going on in China, nor did he have the capacity to do so,” Trump wrote on social media.

READ:  

“I always thought he was a weak and ineffective leader and, obviously, Australian's (sic) agreed with me!!!” Trump added.

Trump was responding to an interview Turnbull gave this week to U.S. media company Bloomberg in which the former Australian leader said Chinese President Xi Jinping would take advantage of the U.S. president's chaotic and erratic leadership.

“I think China will take advantage, massive advantage of Trump,” Turnbull told Bloomberg.

“What my prediction will be that President Xi will aim to be the exact opposite of Trump. Where Trump is chaotic, he will be consistent. Where Trump is rude and abusive, he'll be respectful. Where Trump is erratic, he will be consistent,” Turnbull said.

“And what that will do is build trust with countries, and there'll be many countries who will, you know, looking at China on the one hand and Trump on the other, will find China a more attractive partner,” Turnbull added.

Greenland's pro-business opposition Demokraatit party won Tuesday's closely watched parliamentary election, beating the incumbent left-wing coalition in a vote dominated by U.S. President Donald Trump's pledge to take control of the island.

Demokraatit, which favours a slow approach to independence from Denmark, secured 29.9% of the votes with all ballots counted, up from 9.1% in 2021, ahead of the opposition Naleraq party, which favours rapid independence, at 24.5%.

Since taking office in January, Donald Trump has vowed to make Greenland - a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark – part of the United States, saying it is vital to U.S. security interests, an idea rejected by most Greenlanders.

The vast island, with a population of just 57,000, has been caught up in a geopolitical race for dominance in the Arctic, where melting ice caps are making its resources more accessible and opening new shipping routes. Both Russia and China have intensified military activity in the region.

"People want change ... We want more business to finance our welfare," said Jens-Frederik Nielsen, Demokraatit's leader and a former minister of industry and minerals. "We don't want independence tomorrow, we want a good foundation," Nielsen told reporters in Nuuk.

He will now hold talks with other parties to try and form a governing coalition. The ruling Inuit Ataqatigiit party and its partner Siumut, which also seek a slow path towards independence, won a combined 36% of votes, down from 66.1% in 2021.

"We respect the election outcome," Prime Minister Mute Egede of the Inuit Ataqatigiit said in a Facebook post, adding that he would listen to any proposals in upcoming coalition talks. Greenland is a former Danish colony and has been a territory since 1953. It gained some autonomy in 1979 when its first parliament was formed, but Copenhagen still controls foreign affairs, defense and monetary policy and provides just under $1 billion a year to the economy.

In 2009, it won the right to declare full independence through a referendum, even though it has not done so out of concern living standards would drop without Denmark's economic support.

"I strongly believe that we will very soon start to live a life more based on who we are, based on our culture, based on our own language, and start to make regulations based on us, not based on Denmark," said Qupanuk Olsen, candidate for the main pro-independence party Naleraq.

Inge Olsvig Brandt, a candidate for the ruling Inuit Ataqatigiit party, said: "We don't need the independence right now. We have too many things to work on. I think we have to work with ourselves, our history, and we are going to have a lot of healing work with us before we can take the next step."

Voting had been extended by half an hour at some of the 72 polling stations across the Arctic island, where some 40,500 people were eligible to cast their ballot, although the final turnout was not immediately available.

Inuit pride

Trump's vocal interest has shaken up the status quo, and coupled with the growing pride of the Indigenous people in their Inuit culture, put independence front and center in the election.

In the final debate on Greenland's state broadcaster KNR late on Monday, leaders of the five parties currently in parliament unanimously said they did not trust Trump. "He is trying to influence us. I can understand if citizens feel insecure," said Erik Jensen, leader of government coalition partner Siumut.

A January poll suggested a majority of Greenland's inhabitants support independence, but are divided on timing.

Early on, the election campaign focused on the anger and frustration aimed at historical wrongdoings by Denmark, according to Julie Rademacher, a consultant and former adviser to Greenland's government.

"But I think the fear of the U.S. imperialist approach has lately become bigger than the anger towards Denmark," said Rademacher.

Reuters spoke to more than a dozen Greenlanders in Nuuk, all of whom said they favored independence, although many expressed concern that a swift transition could damage the economy and eliminate Nordic welfare services like universal healthcare and free schooling.

"We don't want to be part of the U.S. for obvious reasons; healthcare and Trump," said Tuuta Lynge-Larsen, a bank employee and Nuuk resident, adding that this election was especially important. "We don't like the attention, to put it short."

The island holds substantial natural resources, including critical minerals such as rare earths used in high-tech industries, ranging from electric vehicles to missile systems. However, Greenland has been slow to extract them due to environmental concerns, severe weather, and China's near-total control of the sector, which has made it difficult for companies elsewhere to make a profit or secure buyers.

Investment pledges

Trump initially declined to rule out military force to take control of the territory, alarming many Greenlanders, although he later softened his stance, stating he would respect the will of the local people and was "ready to invest billions of dollars" if they joined the U.S.

Egede has stressed the island is not for sale and advocated for a broad coalition government to resist external pressure. In an interview aired on Monday by Danish broadcaster DR, he dismissed Trump's offer as disrespectful, expressing willingness to cooperate with other countries instead.

Denmark's prime minister has said Greenland is not for sale, but made it clear that it is up to the local people to decide their future. All six main political parties support independence but differ on how and when it could be achieved.

The pro-independence Naleraq party, the leading opposition force, gained momentum ahead of the election, bolstered by U.S. interest and fresh accusations of Denmark's historic exploitation of Greenland's mineral wealth.

The party believes the U.S. attention strengthens Greenland's position in secession talks with Denmark and aims to bring a deal with Copenhagen to a vote before the next election in four years.

According to Justin Sun, the cryptocurrency market is experiencing a phase of 'small steps, fast running' growth, indicating a strategy of incremental but rapid advancements. This approach suggests a focus on steady, manageable increases in value or technology improvements, rather than large, volatile jumps. Sun's commentary, shared via Twitter, highlights the importance of consistent progress in the volatile crypto space.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP face carnage in response to Trump's policies and announcements. The total market capitalization of crypto is down to $2.784 trillion on Wednesday. 

Bitcoin's correlation (BTC) with the S&P 500 is 0.75 in the 30-day timeframe, signaling to traders that the top crypto is behaving like U.S. equities. Trumpism, or what U.S. President Donald Trump believes in a particular moment on a particular day about a subject that has ushered a steep correction in crypto within the first fifty days of his administration.

U.S. stocks are facing a slump, the S&P 500 is down nearly 8% in the past month, and is lower than it was the day before President Trump won the 2024 election. $4.5 trillion in capital has been wiped out of the market, per the index, and the correction is not limited to equities. 

Crypto, typically considered one of the high volatility risk assets, has faced a steep decline as traders turn risk averse and pull capital from the category. 

While U.S. stock performance is among one of the worst ever recorded within the first 50 days of a new administration, crypto market capitalization is nearly 20% above the pre-election level, even after the correction. 

When Bitcoin crossed the $100,000 milestone and hit a new all-time high, Ethereum and XRP rallied alongside. The market-wide bloodbath has ushered a decline in the top three cryptos, down nearly 15%, 28% and 9% in the past month, according to TradingView data. 

Trump's pro-crypto executive orders and Strategic Crypto Reserve announcement have failed to catalyze a positive sentiment among traders. Alternative.me's Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows traders remain fearful on Wednesday. 

In a February report, Forbes evaluated the impact of Donald Trump's return to the Presidency on alternative investments like digital assets. The publication outlined that it depends on “the details of policy implementation, market expectations, and global economic conditions. While some sectors may benefit from deregulation or tax incentives, others might face reduced government support or policy shifts.”

Traders, therefore, need to proactively switch strategies and adjust portfolios, trade headline to headline, and anticipate the potential changes, such as the inclusion of different tokens in the U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve, to prioritize categories of tokens that are likely to receive favorable treatment or have inherent resilience to policy-induced volatility.

The crypto market and top three tokens continued their decline this week after nearly four-consecutive weeks of correction. As crypto traders digest Trump's tariff wars and executive orders, institutions and market participants have turned risk-averse and realized losses in Bitcoin are mounting. 

BTC is now at a crossroads where financial easing could mean crypto tokens gain, as traders drive demand for risk assets higher. However geopolitical headwinds and Trumpism continue to weigh heavily on the sector. 

The debate on whether a Strategic Crypto Reserve would meet the expectations of the crypto community and what the inclusion of Ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) means for holders of the token wages on social media platforms. 

Traders now wait and watch for the narrative to unfold. It is typical for the Bitcoin price to drop between 20 and 25% before it rallies during a bull market. However, the macroeconomic headwinds and higher number of market movers make it challenging to predict BTC price trends in the coming weeks and months. 

The $80,000 level remains a crucial support for Bitcoin; a return to the $100,000 milestone could see BTC rally towards its all-time high and test it. However, a decline from $80,000 could push the token to pre-election levels under $70,000. 

Another 15% drop from the current price level could erase all post-election gains for Bitcoin. 

Ethereum price is 30% below its pre-election level, back to the price recorded in November of 2023. A multitude of factors, lack of institutional interest, concerns regarding changes within the Ethereum Foundation, liquidation of whales who borrowed stablecoins against their Ether holdings as collateral, and waning interest from large wallet traders have negatively impacted Ethereum price trend. 

Ether trades at $1,846 at the time of writing, and traders await a catalyst, like SEC approval, to add staking to existing Ether ETFs in the U.S. to drive gains in the largest altcoin in crypto. 

XRP is the most resilient among the top three cryptocurrencies, trading 75% above its pre-election levels. At the time of writing, XRP trades at $2.1668. 

Catalysts like the token's addition to the U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve, Ripple executive's inclusion in Trump's elite Crypto Summit last Friday, and SEC's changing stance on litigation against crypto firms have contributed to the gain in XRP price. 

Bitcoin and XRP traders have consistently taken profits on their holdings since mid-February. However, in the case of Ethereum, the behavior of traders is akin to capitulation. Traders have realized losses on their Ether holdings, as seen by the negative spikes in the Network realized profit/loss metric on Santiment. 

Capitulation is followed by stability in prices, however it remains to be seen whether Ether price will recover in the coming weeks and months. 

The total open interest in USD in the three tokens has shown a steady decline since the last week of February. This implies that derivatives traders are losing interest in the top 3 cryptos, in line with the risk-off sentiment and the U.S. stock market bloodbath. 

As Bitcoin behaves more like a U.S. tech stock every day, the “Bitcoin as a hedge and safe haven” narrative takes a hit, and cryptos are identified as one of the risk-assets among alternative investments. 

A crypto analyst behind the X handle @davthewave believes that the worst of the crypto market correction is behind us. Bitcoin bull run is far from over, and the analyst checks the box on five key pointers that support their thesis. 

The average correction in Bitcoin price in the last three bull runs was between 24 and 32% in the years 2016-17, 2020-21 and 2023-24 respectively. The recent correction in BTC is therefore well within the average and does not directly signal the end of the bull market. 

The crypto Bitcoin bull run index is a metric used to analyze nine different statistics to determine the stage of the market cycle. Indicators like PI Cycle, MVRV Z-Score and Reserve Risk are used to identify whether it is a Bitcoin bull or bear market. 

In the last three cycles, every time CBBI crosses 90, Bitcoin hit a new all-time high. This hasn't happened yet in the ongoing cycle, meaning there is a likelihood that the bull market is ongoing and BTC is likely to peak in the coming months of 2025. 

Agne Linge, Head of Growth at WeFi shared written commentary with Crypto.news, commenting on rising market volatility in Bitcoin, in response to shifting macro conditions. 

Linge said, 

“Bitcoin has fluctuated between $79K and $85K over the past two weeks, reflecting heightened market volatility driven by mounting geopolitical and macroeconomic pressures. The market sentiment is tense, and trade tensions have escalated again, with new tariffs expected to be implemented on April 2nd. Today, new 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports have taken effect, prompting a swift retaliation from the European Union, which plans to impose counter measures on goods worth 26 billion euros (about £22 billion pounds) starting next month.

Heightened macro volatility and geopolitical tensions have driven investors toward safe-haven assets like the U.S. Treasuries, reflecting a broader shift toward capital preservation amid growing market uncertainty. Meanwhile, Germany's decision to raise debt to finance a military buildup has triggered a sharp selloff in German government bonds (bunds), reinforcing the flight to U.S. Treasuries as investors seek greater stability.”

Bitfinex analysts told Crypto.news, 

“Such widespread capitulation often precedes market stabilisation, though geopolitical and macroeconomic concerns remain a significant overhang.”

Dr. Sean Dawson, Head of Research at Derive.xyz told Crypto.news:

“The market is facing significant challenges as the macroeconomic environment worsens, and crypto assets are no exception. 

With bearish sentiment building, traders are turning to downside hedging strategies, especially as volatility surges across both traditional and crypto markets. The coming weeks will be critical for assessing how the broader economic situation impacts digital asset prices and trading behaviour.”

According to Crypto Rover (@rovercrc), the US Core CPI data for March 2025 showed a monthly increase of 0.2%, below the expected 0.3%, and a yearly increase of 3.1%, below the expected 3.2%. This lower-than-expected inflation data is seen as bullish for the cryptocurrency market, potentially indicating a favorable environment for crypto investments.

Video-sharing platform Rumble boosts its Bitcoin holdings with a 188 BTC purchase, reinforcing its commitment to a Bitcoin treasury strategy.

Rumble (NASDAQ: RUM), the video-sharing platform and cloud services provider, has announced the purchase of approximately 188 Bitcoin, valued at around $17.1 million, as part of its previously disclosed Bitcoin treasury strategy. Acquired at an average price of approximately $91,000 per coin, this purchase is a part of the company's plan to allocate up to $20 million into Bitcoin.

“We are excited to announce these purchases and allocation of Bitcoin as part of our treasury strategy as well as a larger strategic move as we further expand our ties to the crypto industry,” said Rumble Chairman and CEO Chris Pavlovski. “These holdings have the potential to serve as a valuable hedge against inflation and will not be subject to dilution like so many overprinted government-issued currencies. As a leading video and cloud services platform for the crypto community, we are proud to officially hold Bitcoin as we continue to grow and engrain crypto into our company's DNA.”

The announcement follows Rumble's previously disclosed corporate treasury diversification strategy, which was approved by its Board of Directors. The strategy aims to leverage Bitcoin as a strategic asset to accelerate the company's expansion into digital assets while strengthening its financial position.

“We believe that the world is still in the early stages of the adoption of Bitcoin, which has recently accelerated with the election of a crypto-friendly U.S. presidential administration and increased institutional adoption,” Pavlovski stated. “Unlike any government-issued currency, Bitcoin is not subject to dilution through endless money-printing, enabling it to be a valuable inflation hedge and an excellent addition to our treasury. We are also excited to strengthen our ties with crypto and to bolster our efforts to become the leading video and cloud services platform for the crypto community.”

The company noted that the actual timing and value of any future Bitcoin acquisitions will depend on various factors, including general market conditions, Bitcoin's trading price, and Rumble's anticipated cash needs. Rumble stated their strategy will remain flexible and may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time based on the company's discretion.

Modular blockchain Hemi Labs' unveiled its mainnet with $440 million in total value locked (TVL).

Hemi, founded by early Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik, plans to unify Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two oldest and largest blockchains, into "a single supernetwork," according to an emailed announcement. 

Hemi is built on both Bitcoin and Ethereum to combine the best qualities of both, taking advantage of Bitcoin's security and Ethereum's programmability. The project raised $15 million in a funding round led by Binance Labs last September.

The project is one of several looking to transform the broader blockchain landscape, particularly with regard to decentralized finance (DeFi), through combining Bitcoin and Ethereum due in part to the deep stores of value held in bitcoin (BTC), which comfortably exceed those of every other digital asset combined.

However, Bitcoin's coding lacks the ability to natively build some of the functions that DeFi requires, such as smart contracts or zero-knowledge proofs, hence the need to bridge this utility from Ethereum.

The company has signed up dozens of protocols for deployment on Hemi, including decentralized exchange (DEX) Sushi, liquid staking token pumpBTC and oracles RedStone and Pyth.

Gov. Pillen Signs Bill Creating Protections from Cryptocurrency Fraud

LINCOLN, NE — Governor Jim Pillen has signed LB609 into law. This bipartisan, law-enforcement-supported legislation establishes the Controllable Electronic Record Fraud Prevention Act to help combat fraud and protect users of cryptocurrency kiosks/ATMs.

“Cryptocurrency is an important, emerging industry — and we've been working hard to build Nebraska into a cryptocurrency leader,” said Gov. Pillen. “An important part of these efforts is to make sure that we have guardrails to prevent criminals from taking advantage of Nebraskans. We look forward to continuing to lay the groundwork for a safe and robust crypto industry in our state. This is good news for consumers."

“Nebraska is open for business in the cryptocurrency space,” said Nebraska Department of Banking Director Kelly Lammers. "That also means we need to increase transparency to assure those doing legal business in the State of Nebraska that you are absolutely welcome. Of course, those that target our citizens, that look to exploit Nebraskans and their financial resources, using Crypto ATMs as part of their transfer method, we will soon have a team that will be watching even more closely."

Rumble, a Toronto-headquartered video hosting, streamling and cloud platform, joins the corporate Bitcoin BTCUSD purchasing mania. The statement about $17.1 million Bitcoin BTCUSD added to the treasury comes 10 weeks after Tether's investment in Rumble.

$17,100,000: Video platform Rumble confirms first BTC purchase

According to its official statement, Canada's video streaming platform Rumble, disclosed its pioneering Bitcoin BTCUSD purchasing. The company has added 188 Bitcoins BTCUSD to treasury with an average price of $91,000 per coin, Rumble said in X.

In total, the company is going to allocate $20 million in Bitcoin BTCUSD, Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski said in a press release. 

The company bets big on Bitcoin BTCUSD "as a valuable tool for strategic planning and reinforces the company's expansion into cryptocurrency," the team says.

Fueled by the announcement, Rumble's RUM stocks are up by 2.7% in 24 hours on Nasdaq's premarket. However, the X followers opined that the company might be getting exposure to Bitcoin BTCUSD on too high prices.

As of press time, Bitcoin BTCUSD is changing hands at $81,633. Rumble should be 10.33% underwater, with a negative paper PnL of $1.77 million.

Rumble jumps into top 40 corporate BTC holders

With this purchase, Rumble becomes the 40th largest corporate holder of Bitcoin BTCUSD, Bitcoin Treasuries tracker says. Rumble's BTC holdings are equal to 0.60% of its net market cap.

The liquidation of an over $200 million long trade on ether (ETH) lead to a $4 million loss for Hyperliquid, where the "whale" placed the bet.

The liquidation saw wallet "0xf3f4" opening a highly leveraged 50x long ETH position, depositing $4.3 million USDC as margin for a total size of 113,000 ETH.

The wallet then started withdrawing funds, reducing the margin below maintenance requirements in a move that resulted in a $1.8 million profit for the user but a $4 million loss for Hyperliquid's Hyperliquid Provider (HLP) vault.

Vaults are a blockchain-based product on Hyperliquid where users can deposit USDC to potentially earn a share of profits generated by trading strategies of other users or the vault's owner.

The moves created speculation among Hyperliquid users of a possible exploit of the platform, a rumor it doused in an X post.

“There was no protocol exploit or hack,” Hyperliquid said. “This user had unrealized PNL, withdrew, which lowered their margin, and was liquidated. They ended with ~$1.8M in PNL. HLP lost ~$4M over the past 24h. HLP's all-time PNL remains at ~$60M. As a reminder, HLP is not a risk-free strategy.”

Hyperliquid added that it will update the maximum leverage for bitcoin (BTC) and ETH to 40x and 25x, respectively, to increase maintenance margin requirements for larger positions as a preventive measure for similar moves in the future.

Hyperliquid's HLP vault still has an all-time profit of $60 million, data shows. Meanwhile, the platform's HYPE token dropped from $14 to under $13 in a knee-jerk move after the liquidation, though it has since fully recovered the brief slide as of late Asian hours.

Mercado Bitcoin, one of Latin America's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, is teaming up with Polygon Labs to expand the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) in the region. 

The initiative aims to issue more than $200 million in tokenized assets this year, more than doubling the platform's current total.

The partnership focuses on integrating Polygon's blockchain infrastructure into Mercado Bitcoin's tokenization process, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk.

“The Polygon network enables fast and affordable transactions, positioning MB as a technological and financial leader both in Latin America and globally,” said Fabrício Tota, Mercado Bitcoin's vice president of new business.

Since launching its asset tokenization unit, MB Tokens, São Paulo-based Mercado Bitcoin has issued more than 340 tokenized products, totaling roughly $180 million. These include tokenized private credit, fixed-income instruments, and revenue-sharing products.

The Securities and Exchange Commission is scaling back its cryptocurrency enforcement unit. Why does this matter? Because crime pervades the crypto industry.

Just last month, a hacker stole about $1.5 billion from the crypto exchange Bybit in the biggest theft the industry has ever experienced. As this incident suggests, crypto crime seems to be getting worse, not better.

Indeed, crypto crime likely broke records last year. Illicit crypto addresses received an estimated total of $40 billion to as much as $75 billion in 2024.

Ask a generative AI program for ‘historical' footage and what you get could spell the end of documents and documentaries we can believe in.

Cryptocurrency is being used to perpetrate crimes that affect all Americans. One of the best examples is ransomware, malicious software that prevents users from accessing their computer files, systems or networks unless they pay a ransom. Crypto is the dominant form of payment demanded in these attacks because it enables cybercriminals to receive money anonymously and quickly transfer their illicit gains overseas.

Ransomware attacks reached an all-time high in 2024, targeting sectors that Americans rely on every day. In February 2024, for example, the insurer UnitedHealth Group experienced an attack that affected hospitals, doctors' offices, pharmacies and millions of patients across the nation. UnitedHealth paid a ransom of about $22 million in bitcoin.

Tech CEOs may be doing a political 180, but the majority of engineers, investors and scientists who make Silicon Valley the global center of innovation and profit vote Democratic. 

Like ransomware attacks, meme coin “rug pulls” can have many victims. A meme coin is a cryptocurrency that is inspired by a celebrity, meme or internet trend. They're highly volatile, speculative assets that are susceptible to fraud. In a rug pull, insiders buy up a large share of meme coin tokens in advance and then dump them after the price soars, leaving regular investors with tokens that are essentially worthless.

One recent example is the case of Haliey Welch, who gained internet fame as the “Hawk Tuah Girl” when she was featured in a TikTok video that went viral. In December, after parlaying her newfound celebrity into a merchandise line and podcast, she launched a meme coin. The coin's price initially surged, but its value quickly plummeted by more than 90% after a small group of owners sold off more than 80% of the token's supply. One investor wrote on social media, “I am a huge fan of Hawk Tuah but you took my life savings.”

While rug pulls dupe multiple investors at a time, many crypto crimes target individual victims. One particularly devastating crypto fraud is known as “pig butchering” or “romance baiting.” These scams involve online criminals luring their victims into fake romances and then stealing their money by inducing them to invest in cryptocurrency.

Many people lose their life savings to these scams. One California victim, Shai Plonski, said he thought he had found the “perfect woman” on Facebook. Plonski and “Sandy” traded messages about their supposedly shared interests in yoga and poetry until Plonski revealed that his business was struggling, at which point Sandy suggested he invest in crypto with her guidance. Plonski eventually put his life savings into what he thought was a cryptocurrency investment and, when he became concerned, found he couldn't withdraw his funds. He was one of more than 40,000 victims of these scams in the United States.

Another scam on the rise involves bitcoin ATMs. A scammer persuades a victim to deposit cash into a bitcoin ATM by using a QR code. The ATM then converts the cash to bitcoin that is immediately transferred to the scammer's digital wallet.

Seniors are particularly susceptible to bitcoin ATM scams. Beaufort County, S.C., which has a large senior population, reported $3.1 million in losses to crypto scams last year, including several involving bitcoin ATMs. One retired healthcare worker got a call purportedly from the sheriff's office, informing her that she had missed her jury duty and must post a $7,500 bond to remain free until her court date. She deposited the cash into a bitcoin ATM and lost the money.

These are just a few of the ways in which criminals use crypto to harm ordinary Americans. Unfortunately, there are many others, some of which are used to finance terrorism. This is why we should be strengthening our efforts to prevent crypto crime, not weakening them.

The SEC's new leaders say they don't want crypto to “be a haven for fraudsters.” Unfortunately, it already is. It's up to them and other regulators to protect the American people from the crime that pervades this industry.

Bitcoin (BTC) price hovers around $82,500 on Wednesday after recovering 5.52% the previous day. A K33 report highlights heavy sell-offs in equities and crypto markets amid rising concerns over a fragile global economy. Traders should remain cautious as the upcoming US macro data releases could bring more volatility in risky assets like Bitcoin.

Tuesday's K33 Research ‘Ahead of the Curve' report explains that equities and crypto markets have been hit with heavy sell-offs as concerns about a fragile global economy have heightened. 

Increased recession fears, US President Donald Trump's commitment to lowering 10-year bond yields, and the first swings of a bubbling trade war have pushed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to lows not seen since mid-September. Similarly, BTC reached new yearly lows of $76,555 and saw a weekly return of -5%. 

The report continues that while many Trump measures have contributed to spooking the market into heavy de-risking, the President has delivered his crypto promises by establishing a crypto working group and launching a US BTC reserve last week. This justifies BTC's relative outperformance compared to equity indices since the election.

The graph below shows the major asset returns since the election (left) and the inauguration day (right). Since the election, BTC's performance has been 13%, outperforming other asset classes. However, its performance since the inauguration (January 13 market close) has been negative 25%, the second worst-performing asset (Ethereum is -46%).

“We fundamentally disagree with pundits attributing the recent sell-off to an underwhelming US reserve,” reports a K33 analyst. 

The analyst continues, “This reserve is a watershed moment for Bitcoin. The US government has committed to hold seized assets and even explore paths to acquire more BTC in the market. This is a huge leap forward in legitimizing BTC as a global store of value and is a massive disconnect from its recent performance driven by other market forces. While global market uncertainties may need time to be resolved, we perceive current price levels and the period ahead as a solid opportunity to buy and hold BTC long-term.”

In an exclusive interview with FXStreet, Ian Balina, CEO of Token Metrics, explained that Bitcoin's decline, despite favorable regulations and rising BTC reserves, is largely driven by macroeconomic concerns, particularly tariff disputes between the United States, Canada, India, and other countries. He noted that this has prompted a shift towards liquidity, with ‘investors taking profits and adopting a more cautious stance.'

Balina also predicted continued volatility, highlighting the $70,000 support level but warning that the prevailing bearish and risk-off sentiment leaves room for further downside.

Traders and investors are closely watching the US macroeconomic data releases – the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Wednesday and the Producer Price Index (PPI) on Thursday – which could bring more volatility for risky assets like Bitcoin and shape the direction of equities and digital assets ahead of the Federal Reserve (Fed) interest rate decision on March 19.

In an exclusive interview, Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, told FXStreet, “The FOMC meeting this week will likely result in the Federal Reserve keeping rates at 4.25%-4.50%, with a neutral-to-cautious tone.”

Lee continued though a hawkish shift could emerge if inflation concerns resurface. Crypto prices like Bitcoin might stagnate or drop from their current $83,000-$76,000 range, especially if a hawkish outcome strengthens the US Dollar (USD) and yields, pressuring risk assets. 

“Even a dovish surprise like a rate cut may fail to ignite a sustained rally, given potential market skepticism and overriding macro uncertainties. At the same time, the end of quantitative tightening offers only modest support at best,” Lee explained.

Bitcoin price broke below its 200-day EMA at $85,664 on Sunday and declined 9.14% until the next day. However, BTC pushed lower, found support around the $76,600 level, and recovered 5.52% on Tuesday. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it hovers at around $82,500.

If BTC continues to correct and closes below $78,258 (February 28 low), it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $73,072.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart reads 39, pointing upwards after bouncing off from 30 on Monday, indicating fading bearish momentum and a potential shift from oversold conditions. However, the RSI must move above its neutral level of 50 for the recovery rally to be sustained.

If bullish momentum mounts, BTC could extend the recovery to $85,000.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility.

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

Key Points

Bitcoin (BTC -0.66%) and XRP (XRP 2.13%) might not seem like direct competitors, but if you're looking to allocate a finite amount of money, you'll need to choose which one to put your dollars into. In that vein, even if you're willing to invest for the long term, you should probably have a sense of which investment might be more appealing.

At least for the moment, there's an emerging area that XRP is doing great with while Bitcoin is struggling. Here's why it could make XRP the better buy.

The blockchains that host Bitcoin and XRP have multiple capabilities beyond simply tracking which coins are in which wallets and allowing holders to execute transfers.

For instance, both aim to offer the ability for investors to buy, sell, create, and track real world assets (RWAs) like real estate or commodities directly on their chains. Although the push to onboard such assets to blockchains is just getting started, in the future it could be a major driver of volume and demand for these coins and others that offer the same features. So being a more convenient chain for investors looking to deal with real world assets, especially institutional investors, big banks, and other financial institutions, is an important factor when it comes to evaluating which coin is the better buy right now.

But there isn't much of a contest here. Bitcoin's transactions can take more than an hour to clear, and they cost about $0.37 at the absolute minimum. In contrast, XRP's transactions cost a fraction of a penny and close within a few seconds. It's also already in wide use by financial institutions for the purpose of transferring money quickly and inexpensively across international borders, so there's already a big cohort of users who might be interested in trading RWAs on their chain every day.

And the non-contest is about to get even more lopsided.

On March 22, XRP's chain will get an upgrade that will give it automated market maker (AMM) functionality, which will help to make all of the transactions on its chain more efficient for users, including those who are trading real world assets with each other. Thus, the prices that buyers are demanding will be closer to the actual transaction settlement price for their asset, and the prices that sellers are offering will be too. For financial institutions, capturing those small efficiencies can add up to large sums of money, so it's likely to be a key feature that will drive them to onboard more of their assets onto XRP's chain.

In contrast to XRP, Bitcoin doesn't natively support AMMs on its main blockchain, though several workarounds have been developed on its side chains. Therefore, it's an additional set of steps for investors if they want to trade RWAs with the help of an AMM on Bitcoin because they would need to bridge their assets over to the side chain before trading. This process is too technical for most investors who might be interested in holding some assets on the blockchain, and there are not yet any streamlined ways of doing it.

On the basis of the trend toward putting real world assets on the blockchain, XRP looks superior to Bitcoin.

Nonetheless, XRP isn't the only chain in the running to capture the market for trading RWAs, and this segment is very far from maturity. In other words, it could be supplanted by a more specialized chain that does the job even better. And for a chain dedicated to being favored by financial institutions, that would be a blow, albeit not an existential threat.

Bitcoin, on the other hand, only offers this type of functionality as an afterthought, at least for the moment. So it probably isn't going to be a significant driver of its price unless that changes. It doesn't need to win against XRP, as investors seek to buy and hold it as a store of value rather than for its utility.

The reality is that both Bitcoin and XRP are likely to continue growing, and they're both worth buying and holding. Bitcoin is the more conservative choice of the two, and so for most investors, it's probably the better option. Still, it's worth getting some exposure to XRP soon just in case it wins the fight to track assets on its chain.

Bitcoin (BTC) clawed its way back to nearly $82,000, staging a relief rally after dipping below $78,000 late Sunday, leading to a slight run-up in major tokens.

Ether (ETH), BNB Chain's BNB, XRP and Cardano's ADA rose as much as 3%, alleviating some losses from the past 7 days. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) added nearly 4%.

Elsewhere, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delaying decisions on XRP, Dogecoin, and Litecoin filings. Bloomberg analysts had previously pegged Litecoin's odds at 90%, Doge at 75%, and XRP at 65% for an ETF approval by year-end, yet the regulator's hesitation is keeping the market on edge.

Traders still eye a pullback to the $74,000 level, and below, before an eventual push higher.

“Previously, a similar decline would complete a corrective pullback, attracting buyers,” Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro chief market analyst, told CoinDesk in an email.

“However, the chances of such an outcome are now lower than in previous years due to the powerful influence of traditional financial companies, which has strengthened the link between the crypto market and stock dynamics.The scenario of a pullback to the $70-$74K area still looks the most probable for us. This is all the truer as the consolidation and rebound in early March has taken the short-term oversold stance out of the market,” Kuptsikevich added.

Gains in BTC came as Senator Cynthia Lummis reintroduced the BITCOIN Act, pushing for the U.S. to scoop up 1 million BTC as a strategic reserve. The bill, which Lummis first introduced last year, would direct the government to purchase 1 million bitcoins over five years.

The first $6 billion in remittances from reserve banks would be set aside each year between 2025 and 2029 to build up the reserve and rely on the Fed's gold certificates.

Some speculated the possible inclusion of major tokens in such a reserve in the future.

“Altcoins such as XRP, SOL, and ADA pumped higher than expected as pro-crypto Senator Lummis reintroduced her strategic Bitcoin reserve bill to purchase 1 million Bitcoins, and there's speculation that previously announced altcoins will later be included in the reserve purchases,” Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.

Bitcoin (BTC) price hovers around $82,700 on Wednesday after recovering 5.52% the previous day. Ethereum (ETH) price shows weakness while Ripple (XRP) price shows signs of recovery as these coins expect volatility around the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data release on Wednesday.

Bitcoin price broke below its 200-day EMA at $85,664 on Sunday and declined 9.14% until the next day. However, BTC retested, found support around the $78,258 level, and recovered 5.52% on Tuesday. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it hovers at around $82,700.

If BTC continues to correct and closes below $78,258 (February 28 low), it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $73,072.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart reads 40, pointing upwards after bouncing off from 30 on Monday, indicating fading bearish momentum and a potential shift from oversold conditions. However, the RSI must move above its neutral level of 50 for the recovery rally to be sustained.





BTC/USDT daily chart

If bullish momentum mounts, BTC could extend the recovery to $85,000.

Ethereum price declined 7.69% on Monday; however, it recovered 3.13% the next day and closed above the weekly support level at $1,905. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it hovers around the weekly level of $1,905.

If ETH continues to decline and closes below the $1,905 level, it could extend the correction to retest its next support level at $1,700.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 32, pointing downwards to its oversold level of 30, indicating strong bearish momentum.



ETH/USDT daily chart

On the other hand, if ETH recovers, it could extend the recovery to test its next daily resistance at $2,359.

Ripple price retested its daily support of $1.96 on Tuesday, and it recovered 7.40%. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it continues to recover, trading at around $2.20.

If XRP continues to recover, it could extend the recovery to test its next resistance level at $2.72.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 44 and points upwards toward its neutral level of 50, indicating fading bearish momentum. However, the RSI must move above its neutral level of 50 for the recovery rally to be sustained.



XRP/USDT daily chart

However, if XRP faces a correction and closes below $1.96 daily support, it could extend an additional decline to test its February 3 low of $1.77.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility.

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

Even during one of Earth's largest mass extinction events, where heat waves kill of a majority of Earth's species, at least one oasis of survival existed.

The findings suggest that there may have been pockets of protection throughout Earth — challenging the notion that the heat affected life on the planet uniformly, according to a paper in Science Advances.

About 250 million years ago, a series of massive volcanic eruptions warmed Earth. This period, sometimes referred to as “The Great Dying”, was aptly named. It killed off about 95 percent of marine species and 75 percent of land-locked lifeforms, although some species appeared clever enough to find ways to beat the heat. 

The researchers found an abundance of plant fossils dating back to that time in China's Turpan-Hami Basin. The implication? Even though the region was relatively close to some volcanic activity, it somehow shielded a wide variety of plants.

"This suggests that local climate and geographic factors can create surprising pockets of resilience, offering hope for conservation efforts in the face of global environmental change," Liu Feng, a paleontology researcher with the Chinese Academy of Science and an author of the paper, said in a press release. 

The fossils the team found pointed to a widely diverse plant community that survived the initial destructive events. Those fossils indicate both resilience that allowed them to bounce back from the volcanic events, as well as the evolutionary ability they needed to adapt afterward.

The team's findings suggest that some land areas were shielded from the worst effects of extinction, creating pockets of resilience that played a crucial role in the rebound of life on Earth. The researchers cited the region's stable, semi-humid climate as essential to the area's ability to continuously support life. The scientists analyzed layers of soil in the area and determined that it received fairly consistent rainfall during the mass extinction period.

The findings challenge one prevailing theory about the Permian mass extinction event. That theory claims that volcanic eruptions in Siberia triggered wildfires, acid rain, and toxic gases, which indiscriminately killed off much of the life on Earth. The opposing view argues that these events differed around the globe, due to differences in atmosphere, latitude, and perhaps geography.

The new findings tilt the scale toward the “variable effects” side. Evidence includes fossil records of fern fields and coniferous forests that existed 160,000 years before the extinction and persisted 160,000 years after it was over. The fossils include intact tree trunks and fern stems, which lend credence to the notion that this was local vegetation, not transported by wind or other elements.

The scientists did detect SOME extinction in the area during that time period, but at 21 percent it was far lower than at much of the rest of the planet. Because the plant oasis persisted, it presented a welcome place for animals to thrive after the event ended. The team found some animal fossils dating to about 75,000 years after the extinction.

The discovery of this “life oasis” shows incredible resiliency and suggests that, with the right conditions, plants and animals can persist following major disasters.

	There's no clear quantum advantage yet in tests of real-world problems

A D-Wave quantum computer equipped with a quantum annealing processor (shown) tackled a real-world problem that would stymie a classical supercomputer, researchers claim.

2 hours ago

The tug-of-war between quantum computers and classical computers is intensifying.

In just minutes, a special quantum processor, called a quantum annealing processor, solved a complex real-world problem that a classical supercomputer would take millions of years to complete, researchers claim March 12 in Science. And that supercomputer, the team reports, would consume more energy to run the whole computation than the entire globe uses in a year. However, another group of researchers claims to have already found a way for a classical supercomputer to solve a subset of the same problem in just over two hours.

Quantum computers leverage principles of quantum mechanics to potentially offer huge advantages in processing power and speed compared with the classical computers we're familiar with in our daily lives. This capability theoretically allows quantum computers to tackle problems much faster than classical computers can.

The new, conflicting results follow similar claims made in recent years. The nascent field of quantum computing has been advancing in lockstep with techniques to make supercomputers more efficient, resulting in a closely matched rivalry. While quantum computers have demonstrated the ability to solve truly random problems faster than classical computers, they have yet to come out on top for physical problems relevant to real-world systems.

In the latest match-up, researchers at D-Wave Quantum Inc. in Burnaby, Canada, used a quantum computer equipped with a quantum annealing processor. Annealing processors differ from other, more typical quantum processors and have shown promise in conducting specific tasks. These processors are better equipped to tackle large problems because their quantum bits, or qubits, are coupled to many other qubits instead of just one, as in other types of quantum processors. But they are useful only for specific types of problems, such as optimization problems, and D-Wave's computers have attracted scientific skepticism in the past.

For the new result, the D-Wave researchers used a quantum annealing processor to simulate quantum dynamics by using arrays of magnetized disordered pieces known as spin glasses. This setup is relevant to materials science, where understanding the evolution of such systems can help in designing new metals.

“This is a simulation of magnetic materials,” says Mohammad Amin, chief scientist at D-Wave. “Magnetic materials are very important in industry and daily life,” appearing in devices such as cell phones, hard drives and specialized medical sensors.

The researchers simulated the evolution of such systems in two, three and infinite dimensions. After trying to solve the problem with approximations on a supercomputer, they concluded that it couldn't be done within a reasonable timeframe.

“It's a milestone result in quantum computing,” says Andrew King, a quantum computer scientist at D-Wave. “We've demonstrated quantum supremacy for the first time on an actual problem of real interest.”

Physicist Daniel Lidar, director of the quantum computing center at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, agrees that the D-Wave team hit a milestone. “It's very impressive work,” says Lidar, who was not involved in either study but works with a D-Wave device. “They really managed to perform quantum simulations on their hardware that are beyond the reach of current classical methods.”

But the claim isn't without controversy. King and his colleagues posted a preliminary draft of their paper about a year ago on arXiv.org, providing another group of researchers the opportunity to scrutinize the findings.

Quantum computer scientist Joseph Tindall of the Flatiron Institute in New York City and colleagues simulated part of the same problem using a classical computer. They developed a method that repurposed a 40-year-old algorithm called belief propagation, commonly used in artificial intelligence. Their results, submitted to arXiv.org on March 7 but not yet peer-reviewed, claim to be more accurate than the quantum computer's for certain cases of the two- and three-dimensional systems.

“For the … spin glass problem at hand, our classical approach demonstrably outperforms other reported methods,” the group writes in a draft of their study. “In [two cases] we are also able to reach errors noticeably lower than the quantum annealing approach employed by the D-Wave Advantage2 system.”

The classical simulations focused on only a subset of the D-Wave results, and the two groups are at odds as to whether the classical simulations can reproduce all the abilities of the quantum computer simulations, particularly for the three-dimensional system.

However, the quantum computer indisputably excelled with the infinite-dimensional system. Although not strictly physical, this system is useful for improving artificial intelligence. Simulating it classically would require an entirely different approach compared with the methods used for the two- and three-dimensional systems, Lidar says. Whether that can be done remains an open question.

	The face fossils date to as early as 1.4 million years ago

Reassembled upper jaw and cheek fossils found in a Spanish cave come from the oldest known human ancestors in Western Europe. Researchers date this facial find to between 1.4 million and 1.1 million years ago.

By Bruce Bower

2 hours ago

A Spanish cave has divulged the oldest known fossil remains of human ancestors in Western Europe.

Excavations at a site known as Sima del Elefante produced several fossil fragments that, when pieced together, form a partial left upper jaw and cheek bone dated to between 1.4 million and 1.1 million years old, say zooarchaeologist Rosa Huguet of the Catalan Institute of Human Paleoecology and Social Evolution in Tarragona, Spain, and colleagues.

That ancient midface comes from a previously unknown European Homo population, the researchers report March 12 in Nature.

“This discovery introduces a new actor in the story of human evolution in Europe,” Huguet said at a March 11 press briefing.

Some features of the jaw and cheek resemble those of Homo erectus individuals who reached a site called Dmanisi, in what's now the Southwest Asian nation of Georgia, around 1.8 million years ago. But not enough evidence exists to determine whether the new find qualifies as H. erectus or as a separate species, the investigators say.

Huguet's team digitally scanned each fossil fragment to create a virtual, 3-D version of the entire ancient midface. A mirror image of the reassembled left-side fossils was used to portray the right side of the virtual midface.

A lower jaw fossil previously unearthed at Sima del Elefante dates to between roughly 1.2 million to 1.1 million years ago and may have belonged to the same unnamed Homo species as the facial fossil, they suggest.

Hominid fossils excavated over the past 30 years at Gran Dolina, a cave located near Sima del Elefante, come from a species Huguet's group calls Homo antecessor, which lived between roughly 900,000 and 800,000 years ago. Vertically oriented, flat cheek bones of H. antecessor resemble those of people today, unlike the older Sima del Elefante face fossils.

Evolutionary ties between those two ancient European Homo species remain unclear. Members of the Sima del Elefante species — who also left behind a small collection of simple stone cutting or chopping tools — might have survived until shortly after the arrival of H. antecessor, the researchers say. In support of that scenario, animal bones and plant remains excavated in the same sediment as the ancient midface fossils reflect mild temperatures and a setting dotted with meadows, woods, shrubs and streams.

If recent evidence holds up of extreme cold temporarily driving hominid populations out of Europe shortly before 1.1 million years ago, then the Sima del Elefante Homo species may have died out before H. antecessor arrived, the scientists say.

Huguet's group presents a carefully reconstructed midface for one of the oldest known European hominids, says Harvard University biological anthropologist G. Philip Rightmire, who did not participate in the new study. He suspects, though, that the ancient Sima del Elefante crowd belonged to H. erectus.

Fossil remains of four H. erectus faces at Dmanisi display considerable variation in nasal structure and other midface traits, Rightmire says. One of those faces aligns closely with the Spanish midface discovery, he contends. After H. erectus left Africa, “I would put my money on a long-lasting regional [H. erectus] population occupying Dmanisi around 1.8 million years ago, with later populations moving into Europe,” Rightmire says.

Researchers collecting fossils deep inside Kentucky's Mammoth Cave have uncovered the remains of a never-before-seen species — an absolutely tiny ancient shark with nail-like teeth.

The newfound species is called Clavusodens mcginnisi, or McGinnis' nail tooth. The animal lived 340 million years ago and belonged to a group of sharks known as obruchevodid petalodonts, or "chipmunk sharks" because of their tiny size and unusual teeth.

These sharks grew to just 3 to 4 inches (7.5 to 10 centimeters) long and fed on crustaceans, worms and other prey on the seafloor, according to a statement released by the National Park Service (NPS). It's thought their tiny size helped them avoid large predators while foraging.

Researchers unveiled McGinnis' nail tooth in a study published Jan. 24 in the Journal of Paleontology. The species name is named after David McGinnis, a retired National Park Service superintendent, and their teeth, which resemble old iron nails.

A team of researchers plucked the fossils out of rocks inside Mammoth Cave, the longest cave system in the world. Mammoth Cave is a treasure trove for ancient fish fossils, with more than 70 different species identified within its walls, according to a 2024 study published in the journal Parks Stewardship Forum.

Underground rivers and streams forged the cave's passages, which are made up of rocks that have preserved marine sediment from the Carboniferous period (358.9 million to 298.9 million years ago). The cave has given researchers a unique window inside these rocks, and therefore the marine environments they preserve, according to the 2024 study.

Researchers have been documenting vertebrate fossils in Mammoth Cave since 2019. The work is challenging because of the cave's often cramped conditions and limited space to move equipment in and out.

"Many of these sites have low ceilings requiring crawling for long distances on hands and knees, and at times belly crawling," the researchers wrote in the new study. "The fish fossils are frequently encountered in the cave ceilings or walls."

The newly discovered fossils came out of the Ste. Genevieve rock formation and date back to 330.9 million to 323.2 million years ago. The fossils are the oldest obruchevodid petalodonts discovered so far, according to the study.

Researchers suspect that these ancient sharks may have lived in reef-like systems filled with marine invertebrates called crinoids, or sea lilies, that attached themselves to the sea floor like plants. However, that assessment remains speculative until researchers carry out more studies on the ancient fish and their habitat, according to the study.

Discoveries like McGinnis' nail tooth enable researchers to learn more about long-extinct sharks and the ecosystems they inhabited.

"The fossil discoveries in Mammoth Cave continue to reveal a wealth of new information about ancient shark species," Barclay Trimble, the superintendent at Mammoth Cave National Park, said in the statement. "Researchers and volunteers collected samples from the main Mammoth Cave system and from smaller isolated caves throughout the park that have provided new data on previously known ancient sharks and revealed several species that are brand new to science."

Scientists have found a way to store hundreds of terabytes of data onto a tiny crystal, with plans to scale this up to a disc-sized device that can be compatible with modern computing.

Scientists have devised a way to store and read data from individual atoms embedded in tiny crystals only a few millimeters in size (where 1 mm is 0.04 inches). If scaled up, it could one day lead to ultra-high density storage systems capable of holding petabytes of data on a single disc — where 1 PB is equivalent to approximately 5,000 4K movies.

Encoding data as 1s and 0s is as old as the entire history of computing, with the only difference being the medium used to store this data — moving from vacuum tubes flashing on and off, tiny electronic transistors, or even compact discs (CDs), with pits in the surface representing 1s and smoothness indicating 0.

The hunt is now on for even denser data storage, which is leading scientists to the subatomic world. In a new study published Feb. 14 in the journal Nanophotonics, researchers have used an electron trapped by a defect in a crystal to represent a 1 with the lack of a trapped electron indicating 0.

The work was inspired by quantum techniques, the scientists said. In particular, they integrated solid-state physics applied to radiation dosimetry with a research group working strongly in quantum storage — but this specific work builds classical computing memory.

The technology works by shining a laser with a specific amount of energy that will excite an electron. At this point, a reading device may register the presence of light. No light means no trapped electron.

This only works when the crystals include defects, such as an oxygen vacancy or a foreign impurity. "These defects present very nice characteristics,” first author of the study, Leonardo França, postdoctoral researcher in physics at the University of Chicago, told Live Science. "One of them is the ability to store charge."

Knowing this, the team used rare earth ions as dopants — impurities added to a material to alter its properties — with the key lying in devising a way to excite an electron from a specific rare earth ion so it then becomes trapped. If imagining how a CD works, this would be equivalent to creating a pit.

"We have to provide sufficient energy to release an electron from a rare earth ion and the defect — a nearby defect — will sense that," said França. "So you capture the electron by an intrinsic electric field. This is the writing part."

Then you come to reading the data. "Basically, you have to use another light source so that the electron will be released from the defect," said França. "And that leads to a recombination of charges, and that leads to emission of light."

If the process worked exactly like this, the data would be erased every time it was read, but using lower amounts of light would only "partially erase information," said França. So it would fade over time, in a similar way that data held in tapes fades over 10 to 30 years.

While the team used the rare earth element praseodymium and an yttrium oxide crystal, the work could equally extend to other non-rare earth element crystals with other non-dopants. But rare earth elements have the advantage of providing known and specific wavelengths that enable us to excite electrons using standard lasers.

The researchers' initial aim was to address individual atoms. They haven't yet achieved this goal, but França believes that the technique the team has pioneered puts them on the right track.

Appetite for further research is attributed to how scalable this technology is, potentially ushering in low-cost, high-density storage formats in the future for various applications, França said.

The good news is that the optical, laser side of the equation is already well understood and cheap. Likewise, the crystal would cost little money to produce at scale. That leaves the cost of acquiring the rare earth elements and devising a way to introduce defects using mass manufacturing methods.

—'Quantum CD' could hold up to 1,000 times more data than today's optical disks

—New 'petabit-scale' optical disc can store as much information as 15,000 DVDs

If these obstacles can be overcome, the crystal could be fabricated as a disc, he added, and be read by inexpensive readers. The final question would be around how densely you can store data on a hypothetical disc.

"In our crystal, where we have around 40mm3 [0.002 cubic inches], we could store a few hundred terabytes,” França told Live Science. After performing some calculations, he put the figure at approximately 260 TB.

That figure is based on the crystal the scientists investigated, but França sees a future in which you could easily increase the defect density. This naturally leads to the possibility of PBs of data stored on a single device the size of a disc.

Cancer researchers now believe that targeting the critical energy infrastructure of cancer cells — the mitochondria — may provide a powerful new treatment strategy that overcomes two of the main ways tumors evade destruction.

To kill tumors, doctors use drugs to kill the rogue cells. However, due to the rapid growth of cancer cells and their ability to repair damaged DNA, tumors can quickly develop resistance to these drugs, sometimes spreading throughout the body through a process called metastasis. 

Researchers in China believe that by targeting the mitochondria of cancer cells, both these scenarios could be circumvented.



Mitochondria are specialized structures inside cells that produce the chemical energy required to keep the cell alive and functioning. According to Yanjuan Gu at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, recent studies looking into mitochondria have revealed its potential as a cancer therapy target.

 “Studies revealed that mitochondria lack robust DNA repair mechanisms, making them vulnerable to targeted therapies,” said Gu.

Mitochondria are contained within a specialized double membrane within the cell. In these compartments are the machinery that carries out the energy production as well as a specialized unit of DNA known as mitochondrial DNA. 

One effective treatment against cancer cells is to administer drugs which damage DNA, leading to cell death. But tumors often develop resistance to this because of their DNA repair capability. How veer, the lack of these repair tools in mitochondria prevents this.

Researchers at several institutions found that mitochondria are essential for metastasis — the ability of tumors to spread to other parts of the body. The many mechanisms are still not entirely understood, but changes in tumor cell mitochondria are thought to activate metastasis pathways, where these cancer cell mitochondria can even be transferred to healthy immune cells. This transfer simultaneously suppresses the immune response to the cancer's spread while also facilitating the spread itself.

Based on these findings, Gu and her colleagues hypothesized that by targeting cancer cell mitochondria, they can avoid resistance and prevent or slow metastasis. The challenge, however, is packaging and delivering drugs to the mitochondria.

Any drug targeting tumor mitochondria must enter the cancer cell and then accumulate in the mitochondria — and nowhere else. To do this, drugs are packaged into carriers called exosomes and specific targeting proteins called ligands are attached. Exosomes are membrane-bound structures used by cells to transport various molecules. Ligands line the surface of the exosome and recognize and bind to the membranes of the cancer cells allowing them to get inside.

Unfortunately, finding the right combination of exosome, ligand, and medicine can be difficult because each component can chemically alter the functioning of the other once they are combined into a single structure.



To address these challenges Gu and her team developed a nanoparticle platform consisting of several components, each with a specific job.

Known as OXA@Exo-RD, it is made up of an exosome, a cancer cell-targeting peptide, a mitochondrion-targeting molecule called dequalinium, and the chemotherapy drug oxaliplatin. The chosen exosome is known to be stable when injected into the bloodstream and is not toxic to healthy tissue.

“[The targeting peptide] is one of the most well-known active targeting ligands evaluated preclinically and clinically and holds promise for targeting cancer cells,” explained Gu. The next two target the mitochondria specifically.

Importantly, dequalinium is positively charged, which serves two functions. In cancer cells the difference in charge on either side of the mitochondrial membrane — known as the transmembrane potential — is much higher than normal cells meaning positively charged particles cross easily and accumulate inside.

Dequalinium, therefore, accumulates in the mitochondria, bringing the anticancer drug with it. It is itself also toxic to the mitochondria, and leads to mitochondria failure and cell death. Finally, the drug oxaliplatin binds to the mitochondrial DNA, causing defects and damage. 

Together these components add up to a potent attack on the mitochondria of cancer cells.

To test the nanoparticle treatment, mice with colorectal cancer were treated with OXA@Exo-RD. The team then measured how well the drug entered tumor mitochondria, as well as the reductions in tumor volume and spread from the colon and rectum to the liver.

The results showed that the drug efficiently accumulated in the tumor mitochondria and worked well to reduce tumor size. Compared to control groups, the tumors in mice treated with OXA@Exo-RD were significantly smaller, and when removed and examined, showed the largest amounts of dead cells and necrotic tumor tissue.

Experiments looking at reduced spread of the cancer to the liver found that, compared to control groups receiving saline solution or oxaliplatin on it's own, treatment with the full OXA@Exo-RD nanoparticle reduce the rate of new tumors in the liver up to 86%.



For Gu and the team, these results show that their combination of components making up the nanoparticle are correct. The package was efficiently delivered to the cancer cell mitochondria and worked as expected. But before this treatment becomes commonplace several hurdles remain.

The team needs to evaluate potential side effects to healthy mitochondria and better understand how different tumors will react to the treatment. “Tumor cells exhibit varying mitochondrial membrane potentials,” said Gu, meaning the drug may be less efficient in some cancers. There are also issues with cost, scalability, and regulation.

According to Gu, there are few standardized frameworks for evaluating exosome-based nanodrugs, particularly in terms of immunogenicity and long-term toxicity.

“Regarding cost considerations, the engineered OXA@Exo-RD, as an exosome-based therapy, likely incurs higher upfront costs than conventional chemotherapy due to the complexity of exosome production,” she said. This complexity also reduces the scalability of producing, storing, and transporting the nanoparticles to cancer clinics.

Despite these challenges, “we believe that OXA@Exo-RD represents a promising yet resource-intensive approach for treating chemoresistant cancers,” said Gu. “While current methods, such as conventional chemotherapy, are more accessible, advancements in exosome engineering and manufacturing could help bridge the gap in cost and scalability.”

Using bat poop to fertilize plants like cannabis can sometimes have deadly consequences. A report highlights two fatal cases that affected men in New York.

The patients: A 59-year-old man (patient one) and a 64-year-old man (patient two) in Rochester, New York

The symptoms: Patient one was initially admitted to the hospital for respiratory failure after experiencing various symptoms, including a sore throat, difficulty swallowing and extensive weight loss for about six weeks. At the hospital, doctors ordered a computed tomography (CT) scan of the patient's neck, which revealed that he had mucus clogging his upper voice box and right-side vocal cord.

Patient two, meanwhile, was initially hospitalized for having low salt levels in his blood, which caused tissue swelling. His teeth were also in poor condition, which made it harder for him to eat or drink, leading to weight loss, and he had a chronic cough.

What happened next: When he was admitted to hospital, patient one seemed to be wasting away and had signs of bacterial blood poisoning. An additional CT scan, this time of his chest, showed that he had a buildup of fluid in his lungs. Doctors treated him with antibiotics and briefly put him on ventilation to support his breathing. The medical team later identified traces of fungi in the patient's urine and in coughed-up mucus from his respiratory tract.

In the hospital, patient two had a fever of 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius). A CT scan revealed multiple lesions in his chest and abdomen. In addition, traces of fungi were detected in his urine.

The diagnosis: Both patients — who were not affiliated in any way but were from the same area — were diagnosed with a rare fungal lung infection called histoplasmosis.

This condition occurs when people inhale spores of a harmful fungus named Histoplasma capsulatum, which usually grows in soil and the poop of birds and bats. Approximately 1 to 2 people per 100,000 in the United States are infected with histoplasmosis each year. However, most people exposed to the fungus don't develop any symptoms. Symptoms are more likely to emerge in people with lung conditions or weakened immune systems, compared to the general population.

In these two cases, the patients' symptoms may have been exacerbated by other diseases that they had before they developed histoplasmosis. For example, patient one had emphysema, a common type of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in which air sacs in the lungs are damaged, which constrains breathing.



The pair also smoked tobacco and cannabis.

The treatment: Following their diagnoses, the patients were prescribed antifungal drugs to combat their infections. However, despite this treatment, both died. Between 5% and 7% of patients who are hospitalized with histoplasmosis die of their infection.

What makes the case unique: Both patients in these cases were already using or planning to use bat poop as fertilizer to grow cannabis for personal use. Patient one had ordered bat poop — or guano — online, while patient two intended to use guano he'd found in his attic following a bat infestation.

In a report describing the cases, doctors noted that various online sources claim that bat guano is a "natural superfood" for cannabis plants because it contains lots of nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Meanwhile, numerous U.S. states have recently legalized the recreational use of cannabis — including Arizona in 2020, New York in 2022 and Ohio in 2023 — which may be encouraging more people to grow their own cannabis, the report authors noted.

The dangers of using bat guano as fertilizer aren't unique to cannabis — the product would be risky for any gardening, the authors emphasized. But given guano is being marketed for cannabis specifically, there is a need to raise public awareness around the potential risks associated with using the poop in this way, they warned.

World's First Modular Quantum Computer Operates at Room Temperature

A quantum computer capable of functioning at room temperature has been developed, marking a major advancement in the field. Named Aurora, the system operates using light-based qubits and connects multiple modules through fibre optic cables. This approach aims to address key challenges in quantum computing, including scalability, fault tolerance, and error correction. The technology, designed by Xanadu, a Toronto-based quantum computing company, demonstrates the potential for networked quantum computers that do not require extreme cooling measures.

According to a study published in Nature, Aurora is the first quantum system that operates at scale while being entirely photonic. Traditional quantum computers rely on superconducting qubits that require near-absolute zero temperatures to function effectively. These systems face significant challenges due to heat generation and complex cooling infrastructure. By utilising photonic qubits instead of superconducting ones, Xanadu's researchers have created a system that integrates seamlessly into existing fibre optic networks.

As reported, Christian Weedbrook, CEO and founder of Xanadu, explained that the industry's primary challenges lie in improving quantum error correction and achieving scalability. The system has been designed with smaller, interconnected modules rather than a single large unit. Speaking to the publication, Darran Milne, CEO of VividQ and an expert in quantum information theory, noted that while dividing a quantum system into multiple components may improve error correction, it has been seen whether this approach will ultimately reduce errors or compound them.

The system integrates 35 photonic chips linked by 13 kilometres of fibre optic cables. Researchers believe this framework could enable large-scale quantum data centres, facilitating applications such as drug discovery simulations and secure quantum cryptography. According to Xanadu, future efforts will focus on minimising optical signal loss in fibre connections to enhance performance.

News regarding Apple's foldable iPhone has been circulating for quite some time. Recently, it was reported that the company might launch the Foldable iPhone in the market by next year. Just as discussions about this device were heating up, new rumors emerged about a foldable iPad as well. According to leaked information, Apple is currently developing a foldable iPad featuring an 18.8-inch display.

If these leaks are accurate, Apple is working on a Foldable iPad Pro, and a prototype has already surfaced. This prototype suggests that the device could come equipped with an Under Display Face ID feature. Notably, this would mark the first instance of such technology in a device, as only Samsung currently has under-display Face ID capabilities. If the rumors hold true, this development could pose serious challenges for Samsung in the foldable smartphone market moving forward.

While Apple has yet to officially announce anything about the Foldable iPad, the leaks indicate that the company might aim for a launch by the end of 2027. Furthermore, prior information from the Wall Street Journal hinted that Apple is also developing a foldable device designed to function as a compact laptop; when opened, this device would boast a display size of around 19 inches.

In other news, Apple is gearing up to unveil its slimmest iPhone yet this year, potentially called the iPhone 17 Air. Recent reports have shed light on various details surrounding this groundbreaking smartphone, including its expected launch date and features. If the rumors are accurate, the iPhone 17 Air could emerge as the thinnest smartphone globally, showcasing a design that prioritizes a lightweight construction. 

Notably, it's anticipated to incorporate a silicon carbon battery, setting it apart from its predecessors. The iPhone 17 Air is anticipated to launch sometime in September this year, potentially during an event scheduled between September 9 and 11.

Indian stock market: Kaynes Technology India, a leading player in end-to-end IoT solutions and integrated electronics manufacturing, saw its shares plunge 9.15% in early morning trade on March 12, to hit a 2-week low of  ₹3,898 apiece after the company, in an exchange filing on Tuesday, disclosed that its Managing Director, Mr. Ramesh Kunhikannan, has received a show-cause notice from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).

'The Notice alleges suspected violations in the maintenance of the Structured Digital Database (SDD) pertaining to financial results for the period ended March 31, 2023, as per the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015," the company said in a regulatory filing.

"We are currently reviewing the contents of the Notice and will take all appropriate legal and procedural steps, including providing a timely response to SEBI. The company, the Noticee, and all concerned remain committed to fully cooperating with SEBI to resolve this matter in accordance with the applicable legal and regulatory framework," the company added.

The company shares have been falling recently, especially after the electronics equipment maker trims its FY25 revenue forecast. Although the company reported a 47% YoY jump in its consolidated net profit, it came lower than the street estimates, prompting analysts to cut the target price on the stock.

Global brokerage firm Jefferies upgrades Kaynes Technology India from 'Hold' to 'Buy' while lowering the price target to  ₹5,400 from  ₹6,950. Meanwhile, Japanese brokerage firm Nomura revises the price target for Kaynes Technology India to  ₹6,146 from  ₹6,516, maintaining its 'Buy' rating

Over the last three months (including the current month), the shares have tumbled 44.5%, ending February with a 13.53% decline, followed by January's 35.99% drop, which was the biggest monthly decline since its listing in December 2022.

However, in the long term, the stock is still up 328% over the last two years and 600% over the past three years.

The logistics arm of e-commerce giant JD.com reported its 2024 revenue grew nearly 10%, as external customers contributed 70% of the total

By Teri Yu

JD Logistics Inc. (2618.HK) reported 9.7% revenue growth and a record profit last year, as it diversified its customer base beyond its parent, e-commerce giant JD.com, and boosted its margins through steady technology upgrades and other efficiencies.

The company reported revenue of 182.8 billion yuan ($25.6 billion) for 2024, with external customers supplying 127.8 billion yuan, or about 70% of its total, according to its results released on last Friday. It recorded a non-IFRS annual profit of 7.92 billion yuan, nearly triple the 2.76 billion yuan a year earlier, on greater efficiencies as it upgraded its technology-driven integrated supply chain (ISC) solutions. Its non-IFRS margin rose from 1.7% in 2023 to 4.3% last year. Both the profit and margin were the company's highest since its listing in 2021.

On a quarterly basis, JD Logistics' fourth quarter revenue rose 10.4% year-on-year to 52.1 billion yuan, while its non-IFRS profit rose 23.4% to 2.2 billion yuan, improving for an eighth consecutive quarter.

“Over the past year, we have further consolidated our differentiated competitive advantages centered on ISC solutions and high-quality logistics services by continuously optimizing warehouse network deployment, advancing technological innovations, and enhancing operational efficiency,” said CEO Hu Wei on the company's earnings call.

JD Logistics said it has used its industry-specific ISC management services to help its corporate customers across a range of industries, including home appliances, furniture and apparel, to reduce costs and enhance their efficiency by optimizing inventory management, streamlining resource allocation and reducing operating costs.

Revenue from ISC customers last year reached 87.4 billion yuan. Its external ISC customer base totaled 80,703 up 8% from a year earlier.

In 2024, the company said it fully upgraded its digital supply chain technology ecosystem with its “JD Logistics Super Brain”, which integrates technologies including AI, big data, and operations research into diverse logistics processes.

At the end of last year, JD Logistics operated a network of over 100 warehouses for its international business with an aggregate gross floor area of over 1 million square meters. Its overseas warehouse network now covers 19 countries and regions.

In its global business, JD Logistics said last year it was supporting a leading Chinese new energy vehicle (NEV) brand with its China-Europe trunk line services. It also said it was supporting another automotive brand with its full cross-border services, including customs clearance, warehousing and distribution in the Middle East.

The company continued to build up its network infrastructure last year to expand its freight delivery and international express delivery services to grab a bigger share of the global e-commerce market. As part of its global build-out, it recently announced that it opened its third warehouse in Poland on Tuesday this week.

JD Logistics was the second unit of JD.com for a separate listing in 2021, raising HK$24.1 billion ($3.1 billion). It was originally set up as JD.com's in-house logistics department in 2007 and has grown since then to become one of the largest players in China's ISC logistics services industry.

Cutting Medicaid funding and halting the program's expansion would result in providers revenues decreasing by about $80 billion, and uncompensated care on behalf of uninsured people would increase by $18.9 billion in 2026 due to declines in health insurance coverage, finds a report from the Urban Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Among all provider types, hospitals would face the largest revenue losses ($31.9 billion) and burden of uncompensated care increases ($6.3 billion).

About 10.8 million more people would become uninsured if all states were to drop the Medicaid expansion, with the number of uninsured increasing by 50% or more in half of expansion states, data showed.

"With significant cuts to the Medicaid program potentially on the horizon, it is important that federal, state and local policymakers and stakeholders consider potential adverse effects on healthcare coverage, access, and affordability, and the financial vulnerability of certain providers," authors wrote.

WHAT'S THE IMPACT

Currently, the federal government pays 90% of costs for Medicaid enrollees who are eligible under the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion in all 41 states that chose to expand eligibility (including Washington D.C.). 

But House GOP leadership has proposed substantial cuts in federal funding to Medicaid over the next 10 years, potentially including per capita caps, work requirements and a reduction of the 90% match rate (known as the enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, or FMAP) for the ACA expansion population to each state's general matching rate, which varies by state from 50 to 74%.

The study cited evidence that Medicaid expansion contributed to significant gains in health insurance coverage, and improvements in access to care and low-income families' health and financial well-being, and has had a positive impact on hospitals' and other providers' financial health. That, authors said, is due to declines in providers' uncompensated care burdens – that is, reductions in unreimbursed expenses attributable to uninsured patients and increases in revenue from newly covered patients.

The declines in provider revenue resulting from the GOP's proposed cuts are around four times larger than the estimated losses that providers would face if enhanced ACA tax credits were to expire, numbers showed. 

Because lower spending on healthcare services means lower revenue for providers and fewer services rendered, the resulting decline in revenue could have adverse consequences, particularly for hospitals that are already financially at risk, authors said.

Losses in revenue from states dropping the Medicaid expansion could put more hospitals at risk and potentially lead to large increases in rural hospital closures, the report found. In addition to having negative spillover effects on the local economy, hospital closures could reduce access to and use of hospital services, increasing the mortality risk for heart attacks, unintentional injuries and time-sensitive conditions.

THE LARGER TREND

This week the Congressional Budget Office projected that the GOP's proposed $880 billion in spending cuts would not be possible without slashing Medicaid.

CBO's baseline budget projections show mandatory outlays for Medicaid, Medicare and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) will total $8.8 trillion between 2025 and 2034. Medicaid accounts for 93% of the total, at $8.2 trillion.

Medicaid expansion enrollment increased last year due to seven states implementing expansion in 2020 or later, as well as adoption of the continuous enrollment provision, a pandemic-era policy that prohibited states from disenrolling people from Medicaid in exchange for enhanced federal funding, a January KFF study found.

Even with the unwinding of the continuous enrollment provision starting April 1, 2023, enrollment in Medicaid expansion today is higher than it was in 2020, KFF found. The number of marketplace enrollees increased by 10 million people nationally, almost doubling between 2020 and 2024, and the number of Medicaid expansion enrollees increased by 6.2 million people.

Lowering the Medicaid expansion match rate from the current 90% rate would shift costs to states and likely result in decisions by many states to terminate coverage, according to KFF. About 4.3 million Medicaid expansion enrollees live in states with some type of trigger law that would end Medicaid expansion or require review of expansion coverage to mitigate increases in state costs if federal funding for the expansion is reduced.

Except for Florida, the states with the largest ACA enrollment as a share of population had adopted the Medicaid expansion. The five states with the lowest share of enrollment were Medicaid non-expansion states.

Flood exposure was more strongly associated with increased health care use and cost during the summer months and among Medicare beneficiaries aged 85 or older.

Flood exposure was associated with increased health care use and costs among Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 or older, emphasizing the need for targeted public health strategies and improved disaster preparedness.1



The authors of the JAMA Network Open study explained that extreme precipitation events have become more frequent and intense over the past century and are expected to increase further due to climate change. They noted that flooding impacts health in various ways, including drowning, electrical injuries, and hypothermia. Additionally, flooding-related infrastructure damage can disrupt health services, displace individuals, and create broader societal challenges.



Older adults may be particularly vulnerable to flooding-related health effects due to preexisting health conditions and mobility limitations, which can hinder their ability to respond to flood warnings or evacuations. This vulnerability is not unique to flooding, as most of the residents confirmed to have died during the California wildfires in January were either aged 65 or older or had a physical disability, underscoring the challenges of evacuation for these populations.2



Floods rank among the costliest disasters in the US, with many causing more than $1 billion in damages.1 Despite this, the researchers highlighted a lack of understanding regarding the effects of flooding on health care utilization and associated costs, which limits health impact assessments, risk communication, climate change-related damage estimation, and future projections of climate change health impacts.

To address these gaps, they analyzed the relationship between large-scale flood events and health care use among Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 or older residing in zip code tabulation areas (ZCTAs) affected by such events between 2008 and 2017. More specifically, they examined the incidence of emergency department (ED) visits and hospital admissions during flooding events and assessed the associated health care costs.



The primary exposure variable was the presence of a flood, as recorded in the Multisourced Flood Inventories, a spatially distributed flood database. Also, the primary outcomes measured included incident rate ratios (IRRs) with corresponding 95% CIs.



To quantify the impact, the researchers calculated attributable risk percentages and estimated the number of related excess visits. Additionally, they conducted stratified analyses to assess potential effect modification. As for health care costs, the researchers standardized all estimates to 2017 US dollars to ensure comparability.



The study population contained 11,801,527 Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 or older, with a mean (SD) age of 74.4 (7.6) years. Most beneficiaries were female (56.3%) and White (88.3%). From 2008 through 2017, the researchers determined that 16,536 of 33,140 ZCTAs flooded. The median number of floods experienced in each ZCTA was 1 (IQR, 1-2), and the median flood duration was 10 (IQR, 4-30) days.



The mean (SD) ZCTA flood exposure per beneficiary was 1.3 (0.6). Also, the median area flooded was 34,769 (IQR, 17,319-65,584) square miles, and the median number of Medicare beneficiaries per flooded ZCTA was 4142 (IQR, 2006-7536).



The rate of all-cause ED visits and hospitalizations increased by 4.8% (IRR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.04-1.05) and 7.4% (IRR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.07-1.08), respectively, after flood exposure. The researchers observed the largest IRR increases for ED visits among beneficiaries with metabolic and kidney conditions (IRR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.06-1.11) and injuries (IRR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.04-1.06). Similarly, they observed the greatest IRR increases for all-cause hospitalizations among beneficiaries with infectious disease (IRR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.10-1.13) and metabolic and kidney conditions (IRR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.07-1.12).



Additionally, stratified analyses determined that the IRRs increased with age, from 4.9% greater hospitalizations among adults aged 65 to 74 (IRR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.04-1.06) to 7.3% higher among those aged 75 to 84 (IRR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.06-1.08) and 12.4% greater among those aged 85 or older (IRR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.11-1.1). They also found increased IRRs for ED visits (IRR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.06-1.10) and hospitalizations (IRR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.10-1.13) in the summer months.



Lastly, the mean ZCTA-level cost was $3230 (95% CI, $3198-$32,610) per ED visit and $11,310 (95% CI, $11,252-$11,367) for all-cause hospitalizations. Consequently, the national costs to the Medicare system for ED visits and hospitalizations were estimated to be $69,275,429 (95% CI, $63,010,840-$76,315,210) and $191,409,579 (95% CI, $172,782,870-$206,181,300), respectively.



The researchers acknowledged their study's limitations, including the health care cost estimations using claims data from the Medicare dataset; this approach may not capture the total health care costs resulting from flood exposure. Despite their limitations, they expressed confidence in their findings and suggested areas for further research.



“Although our findings provided valuable insights to the understanding of flood-related health impacts, they also highlighted the need for ongoing research in this area, especially in the context of an aging population and a changing climate,” the authors concluded. “Future studies should aim to incorporate more detailed environmental and individual-level data to further refine our understanding of the complex interplay between flood events and population health.”

If states end their expansion programs, spending on healthcare services would fall by nearly $80 billion and uncompensated care costs would rise by nearly $19 billion in 2026.

Congressional Republicans are debating slashing funds for Medicaid to pay for President Donald Trump's promised tax cuts, as well as increased spending on defense and border security.

Last month, House Republicans advanced a budget blueprint that directs the Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicare and Medicaid, to find $880 in spending cuts.

The budget resolution doesn't specifically mention Medicaid. But Republicans are unlikely to meet their budget targets without slashing the safety-net insurance, which covers almost 80 million Americans along with the Children's Health Insurance Program, according to a letter sent to lawmakers from the Congressional Budget Office last week. 

One potential way to lower Medicaid spending is reducing the amount of money the federal government provides states to cover the cost of expanding the program to more beneficiaries. 

Under the Affordable Care Act, the government pays 90% of the expenses for enrollees who are eligible for Medicaid under expansion — typically working people who can't afford or aren't offered coverage through their jobs, according to the report. 

Slashing those funds would put significant pressure on their budgets, the Urban Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation said in a previous analysis. If all states that have expanded Medicaid drop their programs, the number of uninsured, non-elderly adults would increase by nearly 11 million.

The healthcare sector would also likely see reduced revenue, as uninsured people seek out less medical care. Nearly $21 billion less would be spent on prescription drugs, while services provided by office-based physicians would decline by $6.4 billion, according to the report. Other healthcare services, like home healthcare or dental care, would also fall by nearly $21 billion.

“A funding reduction of this magnitude would not only cause a massive coverage loss but would also be financially devastating for hospitals and other healthcare providers,” Katherine Hempstead, senior policy adviser at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, said in a statement. “Hospitals are major employers and are often the economic bedrock of their communities. These cuts would have major ripple effects on local economies, especially in rural areas.”

Providers would also take a financial hit from an increased burden of services that aren't reimbursed. Uncompensated care would increase by $2.2 billion for physician practices and $6.6 billion for other healthcare services, as well as a $3.8 billion bump in uncompensated spending on prescription drugs.

More than half of the increase in uncompensated care will be financed by providers themselves, according to the analysis. Thirty percent would come from the federal government, while 19% would be financed by state and local governments.

Resident and intern physicians at Hennepin Healthcare filed for union recognition on Wednesday in hopes of improving pay and working conditions for professionals getting their start in the medical field.

A supermajority of more than 200 residents and interns voted in favor of securing collective bargaining rights with the Committee of Interns and Residents, an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union with more than 37,000 members nationwide. 

The doctors say they work up to 80 hours per week for what “amounts to as little as minimum wage per hour,” according to a news release from CIR/SEIU. 

“[H]ospital administration basically uses residents to plug holes in an understaffed system,” Dr. Abishek Thatigutla said. “It's simply not sustainable to keep pushing ourselves this much, and we're unionizing not only to address our conditions but hopefully to improve the system itself.” 

In addition to dissatisfaction with hours and wages, union members specifically cited difficulty for staff who are pregnant or have children.

“One thing that has motivated me to want to unionize and ensure we have a collective voice is that there just isn't a whole lot of support for parents, and especially for pregnant physicians,” one CIR/SEIU member, Dr. Nicole Lund, said. “I want to leave this place better than I found it, and part of that is bringing in a more diverse resident body, which includes women and women having children.”

They've asked Hennepin Healthcare to voluntarily recognize their union.

TAMPA, Fla. — There is no denying that artificial intelligence has crept into nearly every aspect of our lives at a breakneck pace. It was only a matter of time before AI made it to healthcare. Many doctors, politicians, and experts are asking how AI will be used. 

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE EXAM ROOM

"The difference with ambient AI is it's actually more close to an intelligent human scribe," Dr. Nishit Patel, Vice President and Chief Medical Informatics Officer at Tampa General Hospital, said.

Last year, TGH launched new AI-powered software called Ambient Listening. More than 500 doctors are participating in the program. The doctor simply sets the phone down to record the conversation (with patient approval), and the software transcribes it in seconds.

Doctors can spend on average 4.5 hours per day working on paperwork or electronic documentation. Dr. Patel said this saves time while capturing precise medical information gathered during the appointment.

"These tools help us get through the massive amounts of unstructured paperwork and data we have that insurance companies are trying to go through to figure out if this is an appropriate authorization. And, so I think hopefully if we use these tools in the optimal ethical way to do the right thing for the patient, we all win," Dr. Patel said. "What I fear, though, is that if a payer or a health system is trying to use these tools to sort of win a battle, what we end up in is much more of an AI arms race, where, frankly, nobody really wins. And so I think these tools have the opportunity for us to get authorizations more timely."

Pre-authorizations and peer-to-peer reviews have come under scrutiny as doctors and medical professionals are speaking out about dealing with health insurance companies.

ABC Action News reporter Michael Paluska recently reported on those doctors for the ongoing series, "Patient No More.”

INSURANCE DENIALS USING AI

"Are insurance companies using AI to really kick out and deny batch claims by the hundreds or maybe thousands at one moment?" Paluska asked Dr. John Licato, Associate Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department.

"What I can say is that the technology to do it is definitely there, and the technology to auto-reject a claim is not necessarily even that sophisticated," Licato said. "There are lawsuits going on that accuse insurance companies of doing things like that, but, you know, it's impossible to know for sure what they're actually doing. That's going to come out in the trials, hopefully."

"If AI is rejecting claims, then the patient will probably have to use AI to fight the claims because the AI is so good, a human won't be able to beat it?" Paluska asked.

"Yeah, and that is exactly an example of the kind of arms race that we're anticipating," Licato said.

"AI will have a really big part in whether or not your care goes through?" Paluska asked.

"Yeah," Licato said.

"So something gets denied, like a claim. I guess it's going to be on the doctors now to figure it out and get their patients covered until AI is being used in a way where it's balanced?" Paluska asked.

"I'm skeptical that that balance will ever be found, though. I think it's just going to be a continuing arms race. You know, maybe you'll reach a temporary equilibrium, but some breakthrough is going to happen," Licato said.

States are trying to get ahead of the technology. Several across the country are passing laws to make sure a human reviews any claims rejected by AI.

Florida State Senator Jennifer Bradley filed SB794 this legislative session.

According to the bill:

"My initial reaction to that is, I'm not sure how you'd enforce that, right? You know, you say, okay, a human has to review this. What is to stop them from just saying, 'Yeah, I looked it over.' Then you see this text that was generated here. 'I read that. It looks okay to me.' I don't know how you'd enforce that."

Dr. Ronald Rodriguez holds a unique title in healthcare. He's professor of medical education and program director of the nation's first MD/MS in Artificial Intelligence dual degree at The University of Texas at San Antonio. The five-year dual degree was launched in 2023.

Rodriguez, who also holds a doctorate in cellular biology, is at the forefront of AI's transformation of healthcare. He is well aware of all the positive ways AI and automation are benefiting healthcare already. But he also sees some aspects of the technology that should give pause to clinicians and IT executives.

This is part one of a two-part interview with Rodriguez. Here he points out matters of AI in healthcare that require great care by professionals – even places where he believes professionals are getting it wrong. Part two, coming soon, will be in video format and discuss the doctor's groundbreaking work in healthcare AI education.

Q. What are some clinicians potentially doing wrong today with generative AI tools, and how can hospital and health system CIOs and other IT and privacy leaders do to make sure generative AI, today, is used correctly?

A. They are not protecting protected health information effectively. Many of the commercial large language model servers take the prompts and data uploaded to their servers and use it for further training later. In many cases, providers are cutting and pasting aggregate clinical data and asking the large language model to reorganize, summarize and provide an assessment.

Unfortunately, many times the patient's PHI is contained in the lab reports, image reports or prior notes in ways that might not be readily apparent to the provider. Failure to eliminate the PHI is a tier 2 HIPAA violation. Each offense could potentially result in a separate fine. IT providers are able to tell when PHI is being cut and pasted and can warn users not to do it. Often this is already happening.

However, currently most of these systems are not enforcing compliance with these rules at the individual level. CIOs and technology leaders at hospitals and health systems can develop PHI removal tools that protect against these violations. Many of the LLM providers allow settings that prevent data sharing; however, enforcement of those settings is at the provider's discretion and not ensured.

Q. You say: "Our current business model of AI use is an ecosystem where each prompt generates a cost based on the number of tokens. This incremental cost currently is modeled such that it is more likely to actually increase healthcare costs than reduce them." Please explain what you mean by using a clear example that shows how costs go up.

A. Let's take DAX and Abridge, which are systems that take a recording of the patient-provider interaction, transcribe the interaction and summarize it for use in a note. The costs of these systems is based on actual usage.

The systems make life much easier for physicians, but there is no way to bill the patient for these extra costs through third-party payers. Instead, the only current option to pay for these incremental costs is for the providers to see more patients. Seeing more patients means third-party providers will see more claims, which ultimately will be reflected in higher premiums or lower benefits or both.

Other systems that automate answering patient questions using LLMs may provide immediate feedback to patients with simple questions but also comes at a cost which is incremental. Those costs currently also are not billable, and hence the result is pressure to see more patients.

Let's consider a hospital system implementing one of these generative AI tools to assist physicians with clinical documentation. A single physician might interact with the AI engine multiple times per patient visit.

Now, multiply this across hundreds or thousands of physicians within a health system working across multiple shifts, and the cumulative cost of AI usage quickly skyrockets. Even if AI improves documentation efficiency, the operational expense of frequent AI queries may offset or even exceed the savings from reduced administrative work.

So far, AI usage models are pay-per-use and are not like traditional software with fixed licensing fees. So, the more an organization integrates AI into daily workflows, the higher the financial burden becomes.

Unless hospitals and healthcare providers negotiate cost-effective pricing structures, implement usage controls or develop in-house AI systems, they may find themselves in a situation where AI adoption leads to escalating operational costs rather than the anticipated savings.

Q. You told me: "Safeguards need to be put in place before we will ever realize a true improvement in our overall medical errors. Over-reliance on AI to correct mistakes could potentially result in different types of errors." Please elaborate on the problem, and please discuss the needed safeguards, in your opinion.

A. LLMs are prone to hallucinations under certain situations. While some providers are very good at avoiding those situations – we actually teach our students how to avoid such situations – many are not aware. A new source of medical errors can be introduced if these errors are not caught. One way to safeguard against this is to use agentic specialty-specific AI LLMs.

These systems perform double checks on the information, confirm its veracity and use sophisticated methods to minimize errors. However, such systems are not built into the off-the-shelf LLMs like ChatGPT or Claud AI. They will cost more to use, and they will require a larger investment in infrastructure.

Investment in the infrastructure to protect privacy, prevent unintended sharing of PHI, and protect against predictable LLMs and misconceptions rampant in the internet data scraping used for pretraining of the foundational LLMs, will be required. Policies to enforce compliance will also be necessary.

Q. How should hospitals and health systems go about developing proper ethical policies, guidelines and oversight?

A. As AI technologies rapidly advance, major medical organizations need to provide guidance documents, and boilerplate policies that can help institutions adopt best practices. This can be accomplished at several levels.

Participation in oversight organizations and medical groups like the AMA, AAMC and governmental oversight committees can help solidify a common framework for ethical AI data access and use policies.

Landmark, which operates six hospitals across three states, will kick off a marketing process for its facilities in the coming weeks as it seeks new capital providers or owners.

Landmark, which operates hospitals in Missouri, Georgia and Florida, opened its first facility in Missouri in 2006. Since that time, the provider has grown to operate five long-term acute care facilities and manage a sixth, with hospitals in Athens, Georgia; Savannah, Georgia; Cape Girardeau, Missouri; Columbia, Missouri; Joplin, Missouri; and Lehigh Acres, Florida.

Landmark had grown its revenue prior to declaring bankruptcy. For the year ending Dec. 31, 2023, Landmark increased revenue by more than $7 million compared to 2022 to total $79.4 million, the system said in first day filings.

However, expenses also climbed. Contract labor costs in particular exploded, rising 229% since 2020, while salaries, wages and benefits for skilled nurses grew by about 29%. 

The system said pharmaceutical costs have also started to climb between 2022 and 2024. 

“The combination of these factors has strained Landmark's ability to generate cash flow sufficient to service its outstanding debt obligation,” the system said.

Landmark imposed numerous cost cutting initiatives in an attempt to stave off a bankruptcy filing, including layoffs at its business office in Cape Girardeau, trimming the number of human resource professionals and accountants in Florida, and closing a Florida office. It also outsourced hospital billing and collections.

However, Landmark's efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. The provider reported approximately $70 million in assets at the time of filing and $86 million in liabilities.

Landmark's debts include a $30 million loan to Amerant Bank and approximately $13 million in outstanding lease payments to two real estate investment trusts which own the underlying real estate for its hospital portfolio.

The provider said it has “sufficient cash on hand to fund ongoing operations of the hospitals to ensure that their patients have continued access to critical care,” however it will begin a marketing process to transition the facilities to new capital providers or owners.

The filing comes as hospital bankruptcies are generally rising. 

Although bankruptcies were slightly down in 2024 compared to record highs of 2023, filings are elevated compared to before the pandemic, according to research from restructuring advisory firm Gibbins Advisors.

Last year, Steward Health Care's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing dominated headlines as the company sold off its massive portfolio of 31 hospitals.

More provider bankruptcies could come in 2025 if industry headwinds continue, experts say. Health systems filing for Chapter 11 restructuring have cited insufficient reimbursements from government programs as a contributing strain on their finances.

The prospect of deep Medicaid cuts has become a flashpoint in Congress, with leaders of both parties accusing their counterparts of lying.

House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said Feb. 27 that a Republican budget measure would "set in motion the largest cut to Medicaid in American history," and Republicans are hiding the consequences.

"The Republicans are lying to the American people about Medicaid," Jeffries said. "I can't say it any other way. Republicans are lying. Prove me wrong."

Republicans said Democrats were distorting the Republican budget. Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., said, "The word Medicaid is not even in this bill."

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said on CNN that Republicans don't want to cut Medicaid, "and the Democrats have been lying about it."

Republicans are looking for massive budget savings to meet their goal of fully extending President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts. This is a separate process from Congress' need to pass a continuing resolution to keep the government running by March 14 or else face a federal government shutdown.

Here's what we know so far about potential Medicaid cuts.

Medicaid serves about one in five Americans. The health care program for low-income people is paid for by the federal government and partly by states. Louisiana, home to Johnson and Scalise, has one of the highest state proportions of Medicaid enrollees.

The House Republican budget plan adopted Feb. 25 opens the door to slashing Medicaid, even though it doesn't name the program.

The plan directs the House Energy and Commerce Committee to find ways to cut the deficit by at least $880 billion over the next decade.

The committee has jurisdiction over Medicaid, Medicare and the Children's Health Insurance Program, in addition to much smaller programs. CHIP offers low-cost health coverage to children in families that earn too much money to qualify for Medicaid.

Republicans ruled out cuts to Medicare, the health insurance program for seniors that leaders cut at their political peril. Medicare is about 15% of the federal budget, and Medicaid is about 8.6%.

When Medicare is set aside, Medicaid accounts for 93% of the funding under the committee's jurisdiction, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found in a March 5 analysis. That means it is impossible for the committee to find enough cuts that don't affect Medicaid.

"It's a fantasy to imply that federal Medicaid assistance won't be cut very deeply," said Allison Orris, an expert on Medicaid policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank.

After Medicaid, the next largest program under the committee's jurisdiction is CHIP. Lawmakers don't appear to be planning to wipe out CHIP, but even if they did, they would only be a "fraction of the way there," said Joan Alker, an expert on Medicaid and CHIP at Georgetown University.

If Medicare cuts are off the table, the only way to achieve $880 billion in savings is through big Medicaid cuts, said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, a health policy organization.

Andy Schneider, a professor at Georgetown who served in the Obama administration as a senior adviser at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said even if the committee eliminated all of those "other" programs entirely it could only achieve $381 billion in savings — about 43% of the target.

"In short, if they don't want to cut Medicaid (or CHIP), and they don't want to cut Medicare, the goal of cutting $880 billion is impossible," Schneider said.

The $880 billion cut is not a done deal. House Republicans were able to pass their budget package, but Senate Republicans are taking a different approach, without proposing such significant cuts.

Any finalized budget blueprint would need Senate Republicans' buy-in. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., is among Republicans who have spoken against potential cuts; he told HuffPost, "I would not do severe cuts to Medicaid."

The numbers are starting points that may lead to negotiation among at least Republicans, Joe Antos, a health care expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said. "We are a long way from final legislation, so it's not possible to predict how much any program will be cut," he said.

"If the bill also includes extending the (Trump 2017) tax cuts, we are probably months away from seeing real language," Antos said.

Once the House and Senate have reached an agreement on language and the resolution passes both chambers, the committees will work on detailed cuts. To enact such cuts, both chambers would need to approve a separate bill and receive Trump's signature.

Republican leaders have deflected concerns about Medicaid cuts by talking about a different target: Medicaid fraud.

"I'm not going to touch Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. Now, we're going to get fraud out of there," Trump told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on March 9, in keeping with his campaign rhetoric that he would protect those programs.

At the same time, Trump praised the House resolution that would make cuts highly likely: "The House Resolution implements my FULL America First Agenda, EVERYTHING, not just parts of it!"

Would eliminating fraud solve the Medicaid problem? No.

On CNN, Johnson said cutting fraud, waste and abuse would result in "part of the savings to accomplish this mission." He said the government loses $50 billion a year in Medicaid payments "just in fraud alone."

Johnson conflated "fraud" with "improper payments." The Government Accountability Office, the nonpartisan investigative arm that examines the use of public funds, found about $50 billion in improper payments in Medicaid and the same amount in Medicare in 2023.

Those improper payments were made in an incorrect amount (overpayment or underpayment), should not have been made at all, or had missing or insufficient documentation. But that doesn't mean that there was $50 billion in Medicaid fraud, which would involve obtaining something through willful misrepresentation.

The system used to identify improper payments is not designed to measure fraud, so we don't know what percentage of improper payments were losses due to fraud, said Schneider, the former Obama administration health adviser.

Plus, it's a drop in the overall bucket of the potential $880 billion in cuts.

I asked if I could purchase the brace myself and bring it to the surgery. The answer was an unequivocal no: the health insurer's contracted rate required me to purchase the brace from the hospital as part of the procedure.

Recently, I had a routine surgery to repair a torn meniscus in my right knee. This was a relatively simple procedure that many Americans need each year, the kind of thing that you would hope would come with no surprises. Instead, what I received was a firsthand look at ways that healthcare in the United States is often designed to drive up costs in pursuit of profit. 

The day before my surgery, I was told that I would have to wear a specialized knee brace following my procedure. The brace would cost $3,300, a hefty price, though only 10% would come out of my own pocket. But as someone who has been in the healthcare space for over a decade, I've learned when to be skeptical about the costs of medical procedures and equipment. 

So, out of curiosity, I researched the make and model of the brace that would be placed on my knee in the operating room. I learned it wasn't a special brace at all. In fact, the same brace could be readily found on sites like Amazon for as little as $150. 


					Balancing healthcare benefits and insurance costs requires research. From becoming a Difference Card member to offering wellness resources, there are many ways to improve healthcare at low cost.				

I asked if I could purchase the brace myself and bring it to the surgery. The answer was an unequivocal no: the health insurer's contracted rate required me to purchase the brace from the hospital as part of the procedure. The exact brace — at 22 times the cost I could buy it from an online retailer — was part of the surgical bundle with my insurance network.An estimated 750,000 knee arthroscopies are performed annually in the United States. If my experience is representative, that means we're paying $2 billion for these braces each year alone. 

Follow the money 

The reason for this experience is as simple as it is disheartening: price gouging and intentional obfuscation have unfortunately become essential ingredients in an industry focused more on maximizing profits than on creating a sustainable and affordable health system. 

To those of us with insurance coverage, some of this may be invisible – a reasonable $20 copay can obscure the potentially thousands of dollars that make up the total cost paid and provides no information on if that was a reasonable price to pay for that drug or service. Those true costs are hidden, and while insurance plays an important role in risk sharing, the current system too often incentivizes price inflation by insurers acting as a middleman.

There is another way. Third-party administrators (TPAs) make money administering health benefit plans on behalf of employers. They charge employers a straightforward monthly service fee, and they don't monetize members visiting the doctor, filling a prescription, or going out of network. In other words, their business model incentivizes them to help people find and access the appropriate care for their needs, not to profit unnecessarily from it. 

Health insurance companies offer administrative-only services as well, but often those services are neither visible nor easy to unravel for health plan members or the companies that contract with them.

For example, when someone receives care from a provider that is not within their health insurance company's network, they are usually met with a higher billed rate. In that case, the health insurance company will offer to negotiate a lower rate and in return, the insurer typically keeps the majority of the difference between the initial amount that was billed by the doctor or facility and the final “allowed” amount they negotiated. It's euphemistically called a “shared savings” arrangement. 

But in reality, there should be no need to have to negotiate a different rate with a physician or facility based on whether it is contracted with an insurance network or not. Just like there should be no difference between the cost of a knee brace depending on whether I buy it on Amazon or get it from the surgeon or hospital. 

Guidance for providers 

Systemic change moves at a glacial pace. But providers, individual members, and benefits leaders can take steps to chip away at the oligopoly. And the first step is transparency. 

For instance, if hospitals were required by law to publish wholesale and retail price lists, consumers would garner a better understanding of the actual acquired costs of drugs and services, compared to what's being passed along to them or to enterprise customers. While hospitals are required to share standard changes, negotiated rates with insurance companies, and discounted cash prices, wholesale prices are still largely kept under wraps. 

But efforts to curtail unexpected and unfair medical bills, like the No Surprises Act (NSA), have faced significant pushback. Widespread adoption of the NSA has been slow to roll out due to litigation from hospitals and insurance companies worried about their bottom lines. 

In the interim, the price data that is being furnished is largely unhelpful. This so-called data consists of jumbled codes that even the most well-versed data scientists have struggled to untangle. 

Guidance for members 

As patients, much of the onus is unfortunately on us to dig into why we're paying what we're paying. The best thing we can do is develop staunch curiosity about every medical bill that comes our way. 

If you're going to be charged for a piece of equipment like a knee brace, do your research like I did. See if alternatives exist at a lower price online. Ask your healthcare providers if you can bring in your own equipment. If they say no, demand to know why. You deserve to know why.

Odds are, they'll tell you it's between you and your insurance company. It's then incumbent on us to ask insurance providers what things will cost. If they aren't willing to tell you, then it's time to bring that information to your employer's HR or benefits team. 

Guidance for employers and benefits leaders 

Once made aware of unfair pricing, benefits leaders should confront their insurance providers directly. Ask them how they make money from your health benefit plan. Be prepared to encounter that veil of complexity and vagueness again. But at least you'll know you've done your due diligence. 

My biggest recommendation for employers struggling to navigate the world of healthcare plans is to work with an independent entity that has no perverse incentive to inflate the price of care. Employers can look by system, geography, or provider to see what providers are charging, and they can analyze distribution to ascertain whether pricing is fair or within a reasonable set of boundaries. 

At the benefit design level, employers can work with third parties to redirect members to providers that don't behave egregiously. If enough people are redirected, then this will force centers to bring pricing in line. 

We can fix US healthcare by asking basic questions

My story is not a unique one, but rather a reflection of how the health insurance oligopoly abuses the average American patient. When I shared this story with my peers, many seemed to have had a similar experience. We spend around twice as much on healthcare as other industrialized nations, and as of February 2024, Americans collectively owe at least $220 billion in medical debt. 

This cannot continue. Pricing must be grounded in economic fact and a reasonable rate of margin, rather than an endless hunger for profit. The best weapon we have against unethical pricing practices is curiosity — our willingness to peel back the veil of obfuscation. The more people ask questions, the more they'll create a groundswell of change. 

And if we pull on the thread of that veil enough, it will unravel.

Innovative Platform Delivers Real-Time Pricing Data and Streamlines Compliance with New Regulations

VIENNA, Va., March 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- In response to President Donald J. Trump's newly signed executive order reinforcing healthcare price transparency regulations, careviso, a leader in healthcare technology solutions and prior authorizations (PA), is proud to announce how its seeQer platform is empowering patients and healthcare providers with real-time, accurate, and actionable pricing data for medical services and prescription drugs.

Although the No Surprises Act was enacted over four years ago to prevent surprise medical bills, especially in emergencies or out-of-network care at in-network facilities, inconsistent enforcement still leaves many patients vulnerable to high costs. Despite regulatory efforts, many insurers and hospitals continue to obscure real pricing data or publish machine-readable files so large that meaningful price comparisons become nearly impossible for patients. This executive order, however, aims to close these gaps by directing the Departments of the Treasury, Labor, and Health and Human Services to ensure that hospitals and insurers disclose actual prices—not estimates—giving patients a clearer path to making informed healthcare decisions.

careviso's seeQer platform is at the forefront of this change, aligning seamlessly with these transparency regulations by giving patients and providers unprecedented clarity into healthcare costs. By delivering real-time, accurate pricing data and eliminating the hidden fees and price discrepancies that have long burdened American families, seeQer helps ensure that healthcare pricing transparency is no longer just a policy goal, but a practical reality. In addition to pricing transparency, the platform offers real-time benefits verification (RTBV), allowing patients to instantly access details on their coverage, out-of-pocket costs, and network eligibility. Additionally, seeQer's Advanced Explanation of Benefits (AEOB) feature provides a comprehensive breakdown of expected costs before a procedure or treatment occurs, helping patients avoid surprise bills and make the most cost-effective healthcare choices.

While this executive order marks a significant step forward, it primarily focuses on hospitals and insurers, leaving a critical gap for other healthcare service providers. Many routine medical procedures—such as those performed in physician offices or ambulatory surgical centers—are not fully addressed in these new regulations, meaning patients may still face challenges in accessing transparent pricing for a significant portion of their healthcare needs. As the industry moves toward greater accountability, solutions like seeQer help bridge these gaps, ensuring that patients have access to the full scope of financial information they need, regardless of where they seek care.

"At careviso, we believe price transparency is the foundation for improving patient access to quality healthcare," said Andrew Mignatti, CEO of careviso. "seeQer gives providers and patients the real-time information they need to make informed, cost-effective decisions. By simplifying the financial side of healthcare, we're making it more accessible for everyone, giving patients the transparency they deserve about their healthcare."

As healthcare providers and insurers work to meet these new regulatory requirements, careviso stands ready to support the industry with cutting-edge technology that streamlines compliance and enhances transparency.

Less than two months ago, 52-year-old Oklahoma State Representative Melissa Provenzano underwent a mastectomy for stage one HER2-positive breast cancer. 

Less than two months ago, 52-year-old Oklahoma State Representative Melissa Provenzano underwent a mastectomy for stage one HER2-positive breast cancer.

"Luckily, the prognosis is good because I caught it so early. Mine was less than a centimeter," said Provenzano.

She said since her mother's breast cancer diagnosis 10 years ago, she doesn't skip mammograms.

"I usually get them in September or October, but I pushed it back to the very beginning of November because of campaign season," said Provenzano.

Her mother was in the clear for a decade, then at 72-years-old, the cancer came back. In November, her mom had a mastectomy.

"Then I got my mammogram and they're like well we need you to come in. She had her surgery in November and then in December I was diagnosed and I was like are you kidding. Then I got my mammogram and they're like well we need you to come in and by December 11th, I had been diagnosed with a different type of breast cancer than my mother," said Provenzano.

In 2022 Provenzano's legislation, House Bill 3504, forced health insurance companies to cover follow up tests, like MRIs and ultrasounds, once a mammogram spots an abnormality.

"Such common sense things that you don't think about until you're in it. It looks so different now it's like oh I understand exactly why this is such a deal," said Provenzano.

Before Provenzano fought to get those diagnostic tests covered, women were being forced to make tough choices.

"So back in 2022, I had a woman reach out to me and say so the price is depending on your insurance, anywhere $400 and $1,200 and I have to put food on the table. I'm a single mom, what are we doing," said Provenzano.

When the governor signed House Bill 3504, Oklahoma became the 10th state to pass legislation requiring insurance to cover further tests when a mammogram shows an abnormality.

"I cant tell you how many women have reached out to me to say you know, either thank you because wow I actually got a check back the first year it passed, because I'd already paid for it and my insurance company refunded the money. The Komen Foundation actually came out and said it's actually saving millions of dollars across the state for women," said Provenzano.

Now, 27 other states have similar laws. While she's fighting breast cancer, Provenzano is also fighting to pass House Bill 1389, which clarifies the language about exactly which tests health insurance must pay for.

"We're also finding that depending on where you live in the state of Oklahoma, the machine available to you might be different, so we want to capture all of those things under this umbrella. This leaves that in 2022. This leaves the decision as to what you need best between you and your doctor," said Provenzano.

She said her oncologist is working around her crazy schedule at the Capitol. On Fridays, she's back in Tulsa and that's when she goes for chemotherapy.

Provenzano tested negative for the BRCA gene that her mother carries. Her sister plans to get tested, just weeks before her own diagnosis and one week before their mother's mastectomy. She and her sister got matching tattoos.

"We got this in honor of my mother," said Provenzano.

She says she doesn't know anyone who hasn't had a friend or loved one fight breast cancer, it crosses party lines.

"Republicans, Democrats, just kind of gathering around you and offering support and what is it that we need and how can we support you," said Provenzano.

At last month's Pink Stilleto Gala, the Susan G. Komen Foundation named Provenzano the 2025 Woman of Inspiration. An honor that's very special, but she's not doing this work for accolades.

"This one thing can save a life. If I can save one life. I feel pretty lucky," said Provenzano.

House Bill 1389 had bipartisan support. FOX23 will keep tabs on it and let you know if it reaches the governor's desk.

The Texas-based home-based care provider New Day Healthcare has acquired the home health agency Patient Recovery Home Healthcare Services in Houston. Financial terms were undisclosed.

The transaction marks New Day's 14th successful acquisition to date and comes approximately one month after it acquired Christian Senior Care, also in Houston. Patient Recovery Home Healthcare has been in operation for 15 years and will not rebrand post-acquisition. The company's current staff will remain in place, according to New Day.

“New Day is pleased to welcome Patient Recovery Home Healthcare to our expanding home care platform,” said Matthew Griffith, chief development and strategy officer for New Day, in a statement. “Patient Recovery Home Healthcare, along with Christian Senior Care Services which we acquired earlier this year, provide New Day with needed density, brand recognition and talent to grow in an ultra-competitive Houston market.”

New Day now provides the full continuum of its home care services to patients in the Houston area and views the market as critical to its long-term growth strategy, the company indicated in a press release. It is pursuing additional growth in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, San Antonio and Austin, Texas.

Similar to national demographic trends, a growing aging population is driving demand for hospice in Texas. Seniors 65 and older represent 13.8% of the Lone Star State's overall population, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Hospice utilization among Medicare decedents 52.23% in Texas in 2022, reported the National Alliance for Care at Home. Hospice utilization rates hovered at 49.1% nationwide that year.

New Day Healthcare provides hospice, home heath, pediatrics, clinical decision support and personal care to more than 150,000 patients annually from 33 locations across Texas, Missouri, Kansas and Illinois. 

“New Day's value creation model is based on providing the continuum of services while leveraging our proprietary CareLytics software to best monitor patients and to fill care gaps,” said Griffith. “The Houston metro area, along with Dallas-Fort Worth, San Antonio and Austin, provide the needed density and growth potential to align our clinical care models and improve patient outcomes.”

MedCity News INVEST 2025, scheduled for May 20 and 21 at Chicago's Willis Tower, is a boutique healthcare investment conference where healthcare startups, investors, and healthcare stakeholders convene. The startups pitch contest Pitch Perfect is at the center of the conference, with entrepreneurs presenting their approaches to addressing unmet needs or inadequately met needs to a panel of investor judges. One of the judges is Charity Tarn, an investor with Arboretum Ventures. 

Tarn is one of three judges for the devices and diagnostics Pitch Perfect track, which focuses on chronic disease management. She will be joined by Jenni Le, an investor and principal with Venture Investors Health Fund, and Ashish Atreja, a professor of IT Business Operations and Gastroenterology at UC Davis Health. 

In response to emailed questions she shared her perspective as a healthcare investor and some of the challenges startups face in the current investment landscape.

What subsector of health tech, medtech or biotech is your firm allocating more investment in 2025 and what's an area you are moving away from? Why?

The four pillars of our investment thesis include medtech, healthtech, life science tools and diagnostics, and pharma adjacent technologies. Our current portfolio weighs more towards medical devices. We aren't moving away from our core thesis, but we are taking a fresh look at tech-enabled services and healthcare IT, spaces that we have historically found success in, but have been such dynamic ecosystems. I'm excited about the potential opportunities that will emerge in the next couple of years.

Have you seen any shifts in the way startups seek investment in the past couple of years? 

I think the fundraising environment has been very tough, and financing risk has increased. I think startups have adapted by becoming increasingly capital efficient and are giving extra scrutiny in defining value-driving milestones in anticipation of future funding needs.

Have you seen a shift in healthcare or biopharma strategic investor priorities in recent years?

I think uncertainties in the macro environment may drive priorities to more de-risked investments with more predictable business models, and investments that are more immediately accretive.

What is an example of a portfolio company's work you are particularly proud of?

I am very proud of the team at SonarMD and what they've achieved. Last year was an important year, and the team worked through some tough commercial headwinds and strategic questions that put the company on track to further growth and helping more GI patients manage their symptoms and care. The value-based care world is not easy to navigate!

Death rates from breast cancer will fall in 2025 in every age group in the EU and the UK apart from in EU patients aged 80 years and older. In these older patients, overall mortality rates from the disease are predicted to rise by nearly 10% in 2025.

However, in the UK, breast cancer death rates are expected to decrease by 7% in this age group, compared to rates observed between 2015-2019. In Spain, there is also a 4% decrease in patients aged 80 and over.

These findings are from a new study published in the leading cancer journal Annals of Oncology today (Wednesday), which predicts death rates from cancer in the EU and UK for 2025.

Researchers led by Carlo La Vecchia (MD), Professor of Medical Statistics and Epidemiology at the University of Milan (Italy), suspect that the reason why death rates from breast cancer are increasing in older patients in the EU is because women aged 80 and older are not screened regularly for breast cancer and are less likely to receive the most up-to-date treatments.

Prof. La Vecchia said: "Elderly women are not covered by screening and probably are less favourably affected by the substantial advances in breast cancer management, including improvements in chemo- and hormone therapy, such as trastuzumab and related drugs, but also in radiotherapy and surgery.

"The increased prevalence of overweight and obesity over the last few decades in most of northern and central Europe has led to an increased risk of breast cancer. In the elderly, this has not been counter-balanced by improved diagnosis and management. This accounts for the increased mortality in people aged 80 and over."

Younger women aged between 20 to 49 years are usually not screened regularly either, but the experts predict death rates will fall by about 7% in this age group in the EU and by almost 15% in the UK, compared to death rates seen between 2015-2019.

Prof. La Vecchia and colleagues predict that, compared to death rates in 2020, breast cancer rates overall will fall by 4% in the EU and by 6% in the UK in 2025. The age standardised mortality rate (ASMR) in the EU will be 13.3 deaths per 100,000 of the female population (a total of 90,100 deaths) and 13.2 per 100,000 in the UK (a total of 11,400 deaths).

The rates vary by country and age group. In Germany, overall breast cancer death rates will fall by 14%, in the UK by 10%, in Poland by 9%, in France and Spain by 8%, and in Italy by 2%. Across all age groups, breast cancer death rates will fall by 7%-12% in the EU in different age groups, with the exception of women aged 80 and over where there will be an increase in the EU, apart from Spain.

"We estimate that between 1989 and 2025, 373,000 breast cancer deaths have been avoided in the EU and 197,000 in the UK. Most of these are due to improved management and therapy, but 25-30% are likely to be attributable to more widespread screening and early diagnosis," said Prof. La Vecchia.

"Given that breast cancer is now a largely curable cancer that requires modern integrated approaches, it is essential that all diagnoses of breast cancer are referred to comprehensive cancer centres, which can offer the complete range of therapies that might be required.

"As indicated by the unfavorable trends in elderly women, control of overweight and obesity is a priority now, not only for cardiovascular diseases, but also for cancer, including breast cancer."

The researchers analyzed cancer death rates in the EU 27 Member States as a whole and separately in the UK. They looked at the five most populous EU countries (France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain) and, individually, for stomach, intestines, pancreas, lung, breast, uterus (including cervix), ovary, prostate, bladder and leukemias for men and women]. Prof. La Vecchia and his colleagues collected data on deaths from the World Health Organization and United Nations databases from 1970 to 2021 for most of the EU-27 and the UK. This is the fifteenth consecutive year the researchers have published these predictions, which have proved to be reliable over the years.

In the EU-27 countries, they predict there will be a 3.5% fall in the age-standardized death rates for all cancers from 125 per 100,000 of the population in 2020 to 121 per 100,000 in 2025 for men, and a 1% fall from 80 to 79 per 100,000 among women. A total of approximately 1,280,000 people will die from the disease in the EU and 173,000 in the UK.

In the UK, the age-standardized death rate for all cancers in men will fall by 10% from 112 to 101 per 100,000, and by 6% from 87.6 to 82 per 100,000 among women in 2025.

However, due to the increasing numbers of elderly people in the population, the actual number of deaths from cancer will rise from 671,963 in 2020 to 709,400 men in the EU in 2025, and from 537,866 to 570,500 women. In the UK, the number of deaths will rise from 91,239 to 92,200 men and from 80,378 to 81,100 women.

Death rates from most cancers are predicted to fall this year in the EU, with the exception of pancreatic cancer: up 2% in men and 3% in women. In women, lung cancer is also predicted to rise by nearly 4%, and bladder cancer will rise by nearly 2%.

In the UK, the only death rates predicted to rise are those for bowel cancer in women and in the uterus (both by less than 1%). Death rates from all other cancers are falling in both sexes.

Smoking remains by far the major recognised cause of pancreatic cancer, accounting for 20 to 35% of cases in various populations and age groups, according to their different smoking habits. Diabetes, being overweight and developing the metabolic syndrome account for around 5% of pancreatic cancers in Europe. This is becoming more and more important following the increasing prevalence of obesity, but control and avoidance of smoking remains the top priority for pancreatic cancer control."

Prof. Eva Negri from the University of Bologna (Italy), co-leader of the research

Over 37 years between 1988 and 2025, the researchers calculated the number of cancer deaths avoided, assuming that rates remained constant at the 1988 rates. They estimate that a total of 6.8 million deaths from all cancers have been avoided in the EU (4,700,000 in men and 2,100,000 in women), and a total of 1,500,000 in the UK (1 million in men and 500,000 in women).

Lung cancer will kill the greatest absolute number of men in both the EU and the UK (151,000 and 16,700 respectively), and among women in the UK (15,500). In the EU, breast cancer will kill the greatest number of EU women, but the predicted death rate from lung cancer is now slightly higher than breast cancer in these women and is increasing (up 3.8%), whereas it is falling for breast cancer (down 3.6%).

Prof. La Vecchia concluded: "Trends in cancer mortality continue to be favourable across Europe. However, there are a few negative indications. These include deaths from bowel cancer in people younger than 50, which have started to increase in the UK and several central and northern Europe countries, mainly due to increased prevalence of overweight and obesity in the young who are not covered by colorectal cancer screening.

"In addition, death rates from pancreatic cancer are not decreasing in the EU, and it is now the fourth cause of cancer death in Europe after lung, colorectal and breast cancer. Death rates from lung cancer are starting to level off but not yet to decrease in EU women. The trends in pancreatic and female lung cancer underline the urgency of implementing stricter tobacco control across Europe."

A federal judge blocked Donald Trump's executive order banning trans youth healthcare, but access remains uncertain

Aryn Kavanaugh was sitting in her living room in South Carolina when her 17-year-old daughter came into the room and said: “I'm really scared. I think people are gonna die.” Katherine, who is using her middle name for her protection, told Kavanaugh that she thought transgender youth may be the target of violence due to the hate generated by Donald Trump's recent action.

On 28 January, Trump issued an executive order to ban access to gender-affirming care for youth under 19 years old. It directed federal agencies to deny funding to institutions that offer gender-affirming medical care including hormones and puberty blockers.

“She just felt like the world was crumbling around her. So we talked it out and tried to stay super positive,” said Kavanaugh, a parent of two trans children. “I think she really feels like we're on the edge of chaos.”

In a victory for trans kids and their families, a federal judge in Maryland blocked the ban on 4 March. The preliminary injunction extended a mid-February restraining order that blocked Trump's directive and will remain in effect until further order from the US district court for the district of Maryland. In the meantime, the order prohibits the government from withholding federal funding to healthcare facilities that provide treatment to trans youth.

Still, the executive order sent parents, children and medical providers into a tailspin as they deciphered its impacts. Some hospitals immediately canceled appointments and turned away new patients to adhere to the directive. In early February, Katherine was dropped as a patient at Virginia Commonwealth University, where she received gender-affirming care after South Carolina banned hormone therapy, surgery and puberty blockers for trans youth last year. Some parents say that their children's mental health severely declined in the weeks following the executive order. And as a result, families have gone to great lengths to ensure that their trans kids continue to receive care, including considering moving abroad or stocking up on puberty suppressants.

“We have seen dozens of families affected across the United States, in many, many states that have been left and abandoned without care that they need,” said Omar Gonzalez-Pagan, senior counsel and healthcare strategist at the LGBTQ+ civil rights organization Lambda Legal. “This is an unlawful executive order because it seeks to override the congressional mandate to condition federal financial assistance on non-discrimination, and this order seeks to require discrimination as a condition of federal funding.”

The pause follows a lawsuit filed on 4 February by civil rights organizations including Lambda Legal and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) on behalf of transgender youth. ACLU staff told the Guardian that they anticipated that the preliminary injunction would remain through the court proceedings.

Some hospitals that stopped providing care to trans youth after the January directive, such as Children's Hospital Los Angeles and Children's Hospital of Richmond, lifted limits on surgeries or hormonal therapy in late February. Kavanaugh said she was “relieved and hopeful” about the preliminary injunction, though it does not roll back South Carolina's ban on trans youth healthcare, which was signed into law last year.

Her 18-year-old trans son Parker and Katherine received treatment at Medical University of South Carolina and then a private clinic in the state for several years until Henry McMaster, the governor of South Carolina, signed into law a ban on gender-affirming care for trans minors in May 2024. Parker is now old enough to receive his care in South Carolina, but the state ban means that the family has had to drive more than five hours each way to Virginia Commonwealth University for Katherine's doctors' appointments and medicine every few months.

Being dropped as a patient due to the federal ban “puts us in a really tough spot because we're already having to find care outside of South Carolina. And so that just limits our options,” Kavanaugh said. Katherine's doctors connected her to a private medical practice in Fairfax, Virginia, that does not receive federal funding, so they were able to avoid a lapse in her care. While the change in providers did not cost more money, it stretched their commute to more than seven hours.

In late February, Katherine's puberty-blocker treatment at Virginia Commonwealth University resumed. In a statement, the hospital said that patients would continue medications, but that surgeries would remain suspended. Trans kids' treatment remains in limbo as federal challenges wind through the court.

Studies have shown that gender-affirming medical care greatly improves trans people's mental health and quality of life. A 2022 report published in the journal JAMA Network Open analyzed data from a study of 104 transgender and non-binary youth from ages 13 to 20 who received hormonal therapy or puberty blockers at the Seattle Children's Gender Clinic for a year. Researchers found that 60% of participants reported lower rates of depression and 73% had less odds of suicidal ideation and self harm after receiving gender-affirming hormones and puberty blockers.

Black transgender people, who experience the intersecting stigma of being gender diverse and racial minorities, are at even greater risk of poor mental health. A 2022 national survey of 33,993 LGBTQ+ young people by the Trevor Project, a non-profit, found that one in four Black transgender and nonbinary youth attempted suicide in the past year, more than double the rate of their cisgender counterparts.

“It's already difficult to access healthcare and treatment. It's additionally difficult for folks who belong to other marginalized communities, especially families and children of color, as well as folks who are on various forms of state-funded insurance and may have difficulty selecting their providers to begin with,” Harper Seldin, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU, told the Guardian.

“There is already a subset of gender clinics in this country who provide this care. When you lay over on top of that insurance and access based on family means, it's particularly devastating for families who can't just pick up and go somewhere else – to another city, state or other country – to get care.”

While her trans daughter's care hasn't been directly affected by the executive order, Sarah, a Texas mother who asked that her last name not be used to protect her daughter's privacy, said that her daughter Raven was devastated by the president's directive. Raven, a 16-year-old Black trans girl in Texas who is using a pseudonym, dropped out of school last month due to her declining mental health, exacerbated by the federal ban. Sarah said that Raven had rarely got out of bed, and when she did, she would show her mom news reports of murdered Black trans girls and women.

“She has told me that she's afraid of being killed if she leaves the house,” Sarah said. “She really only will leave the house with me. But that's very few and far between, because she's just incredibly depressed.”

Since dropping out of school, Sarah said that Raven's depression and anxiety significantly decreased, and she plans to start GED test preparation classes over the summer.

In November 2024, the LGBTQ+ non-profit Human Rights Campaign Foundation released a report that showed that half of the 36 transgender people killed in the last 12 months were Black trans women. That reality has made it terrifying for Raven to live as a Black trans girl, Sarah said.

Raven's medical providers have increased her antidepressants dosage, and she now checks in with her psychiatrist every three weeks. Since last year, Raven has had to fly to Colorado every six months to receive gender-affirming care due to a Texas ban on treatment for minors. She has received grants from the non-profit Campaign on Southern Equality to fund the travel for medical treatment, which has helped defer some of the exorbitant costs of seeking out-of-state care.

Sarah said that she has researched living in other nations and would be willing to order medicine from Canada if Raven could no longer get medical treatment in Colorado. Gender-affirming care has drastically improved Raven's life. “She feels more herself,” Sarah said. “If she didn't have it, I don't think she would choose to stay alive.”

Navigating medical care restrictions has caused anxiety for parents who are shouldering the burden of the policies' twists and turns for their children. A Georgia-based parent, Peter Isbister, said that he had chosen not to share the news of the executive order with his 11-year-old trans son Lev, who is using a pseudonym out of fear of harassment: “It's taken a psychological toll on his parents, not on him.”

An endocrinologist is currently monitoring Lev's hormone levels to determine when he will be put on puberty blockers. Isbister, an attorney and founder of the peer support network Metro Atlanta TransParent, has to contend with the federal executive order and a looming ban on puberty blockers for minors in Georgia.

“If the bill passes in Georgia, then we as a family are going to really have to study up more seriously on how it works to be an out-of-state person to get care in California, New Mexico, Massachusetts or wherever,” Isbister said. “And the more states that restrict access to care, the harder that's going to be.”

As a result of the federal and state policies, Isbister said that he has talked with an immigration attorney about acquiring Canadian citizenship for his son. But at least for now, Lev's clinic continues to provide him care.

While Isbister was “heartened” by the judge's injunction on the executive order, he said that it is “wrenching and in my view unjust that my ability to provide my kid healthcare should be an issue for our federal courts”.

Rebecca Smith-Bindman, a professor at the University of California-San Francisco medical school, has spent well over a decade researching the disquieting risk that one of modern medicine's most valuable tools, computerized tomography scans, can sometimes cause cancer.

Smith-Bindman and like-minded colleagues have long pushed for federal policies aimed at improving safety for patients undergoing CT scans. Under new Medicare regulations effective this year, hospitals and imaging centers must start collecting and sharing more information about the radiation their scanners emit.

About 93 million CT scans are performed every year in the United States, according to IMV, a medical market research company that tracks imaging. More than half of those scans are for people 60 and older. Yet there is scant regulation of radiation levels as the machines scan organs and structures inside bodies. Dosages are erratic, varying widely from one clinic to another, and are too often unnecessarily high, Smith-Bindman and other critics say.

"It's unfathomable," Smith-Bindman said. "We keep doing more and more CTs, and the doses keep going up."

One CT scan can expose a patient to 10 or 15 times as much radiation as another, Smith-Bindman said. "There is very large variation," she said, "and the doses vary by an order of magnitude — tenfold, not 10% different — for patients seen for the same clinical problem." In outlier institutions, the variation is even higher, according to research she and a team of international collaborators have published.

She and other researchers estimated in 2009 that high doses could be responsible for 2% of cancers. Ongoing research shows it's probably higher, since far more scans are performed today.

The cancer risk from CT scans for any individual patient is very low, although it rises for patients who have numerous scans throughout their lives. Radiologists don't want to scare off patients who can benefit from imaging, which plays a crucial role in identifying life-threatening conditions like cancers and aneurysms and guides doctors through complicated procedures.

But the new data collection rules from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued in the closing months of the Biden administration are aimed at making imaging safer. They also require a more careful assessment of the dosing, quality, and necessity of CT scans.

The requirements, rolled out in January, are being phased in over about three years for hospitals, outpatient settings, and physicians. Under the complicated reporting system, not every radiologist or health care setting is required to comply immediately. Providers could face financial penalties under Medicare if they don't comply, though those will be phased in, too, starting in 2027.

When the Biden administration issued the new guidelines, a CMS spokesperson said in an email that excessive and unnecessary radiation exposure was a health risk that could be addressed through measurement and feedback to hospitals and physicians. The agency at the time declined to make an official available for an interview. The Trump administration did not respond to a request for comment for this article.

The Leapfrog Group, an organization that tracks hospital safety, welcomed the new rules. "Radiation exposure is a very serious patient safety issue, so we commend CMS for focusing on CT scans," said Leah Binder, the group's president and CEO. Leapfrog has set standards for pediatric exposure to imaging radiation, "and we find significant variation among hospitals," Binder added.

CMS contracted with UCSF in 2019 to research solutions aimed at encouraging better measurement and assessment of CTs, leading to the development of the agency's new approach.

The American College of Radiology and three other associations involved in medical imaging, however, objected to the draft CMS rules when they were under review, arguing in written comments in 2023 that they were excessively cumbersome, would burden providers, and could add to the cost of scans. The group was also concerned, at that time, that health providers would have to use a single, proprietary tech tool for gathering the dosing and any related scan data.

The single company in question, Alara Imaging, supplies free software that radiologists and radiology programs need to comply with the new regulations. The promise to keep it free is included in the company's copyright. Smith-Bindman is a co-founder of Alara Imaging, and UCSF also has a stake in the company, which is developing other health tech products unrelated to the CMS imaging rule that it does plan to commercialize.

But the landscape has recently changed. ACR said in a statement from Judy Burleson, ACR vice president for quality management programs, that CMS is allowing in other vendors — and that ACR itself is "in discussion with Alara" on the data collection and submission. In addition, a company called Medisolv, which works on health care quality, said at least one client is working with another vendor, Imalogix, on the CT dose data.

Several dozen health quality and safety organizations — including some national leaders in patient safety, like the Institute of Healthcare Improvement — have supported CMS' efforts.

Concerns about CT dosing are long-standing. A landmark study published in JAMA Internal Medicine in 2009 by a research team that included experts from the National Cancer Institute, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and universities estimated that CT scans were responsible for 29,000 excess cancer cases a year in the United States, about 2% of all cases diagnosed annually.

But the number of CT scans kept climbing. By 2016, it was estimated at 74 million, up 20% in a decade, though radiologists say dosages of radiation per scan have declined. Some researchers have noted that U.S. doctors order far more imaging than physicians in other developed countries, arguing some of it is wasteful and dangerous.

More recent studies, some looking at pediatric patients and some drawing on radiation exposure data from survivors of the atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan, have also identified CT scan risk.

Older people may face greater cancer risks because of imaging they had earlier in life. And scientists have emphasized the need to be particularly careful with children, who may be more vulnerable to radiation exposure while young and face the consequences of cumulative exposure as they age.

Max Wintermark, a neuroradiologist at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who has been involved in the field's work on appropriate utilization of imaging, said doctors generally follow dosing protocols for CT scans. In addition, the technology is improving; he expects artificial intelligence to soon help doctors determine optimal imaging use and dosing, delivering "the minimum amount of radiation dose to get us to the diagnosis that we're trying to reach."

But he said he welcomes the new CMS regulations.

"I think the measures will help accelerate the transition towards always lower and lower doses," he said. "They are helpful."

EXCLUSIVE — The House GOP's campaign committee is taking aim at congressional Democrats for voting against a measure to fund the federal government through Sept. 30 and avoid a government shutdown at the end of this week.

The National Republican Congressional Committee is launching digital ads against 35 House Democrats who may face challenging or competitive races in the 2026 midterms, when the GOP aims to defend its fragile majority in the chamber.

The spots, shared first with Fox News Wednesday morning, are going up hours after the House, almost entirely along party lines, voted 217-213 to pass a Republican-crafted bill that cuts non-defense spending by roughly $13 billion, boosts defense spending by around $6 billion and gives President Donald Trump more leeway in how to spend the funds.

Thanks to heavy last-minute lobbying by Trump and his allies inside and outside the chamber, the House GOP didn't need a single Democrat's vote to pass the bill.

One Democrat, moderate Jared Golden of Maine, who represents a district carried by Trump the past three presidential elections, voted for the Republican measure.

And the one Republican to vote against the bill, far right Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, is being threatened by Trump and his allies with a possible primary challenge next year when he's up for re-election.

The digital ads by the NRCC, which are identical for all the targets, will run online in the districts of Democratic representatives Josh Harder (CA-09), Adam Gray (CA-13), Jim Costa, (CA-21), Raul Ruiz (CA-25), George Whitesides (CA-27), Derek Tran (CA-45), Dave Min (CA-47) and Mike Levin (CA-49) of California; Darren Soto (FL-09) and Jared Moskowitz (FL-23) of Florida; Eric Sorensen (IL-17) of Illinois; Frank Mrvan (IN-01) of Indiana; Kristen McDonald Rivet (MN-08) of Michigan; Don Davis (NC-01) of North Carolina; Chris Pappas (NH-01) and Maggie Goodlander (NH-02) of New Hampshire; Josh Gottheimer (NJ-05) and Nellie Pou (NJ-09) of New Jersey; Gabe Vasquez (NM-02) of New Mexico; Dina Titus (NV-01), Susie Lee (NV-03) and Steven Horsford (NV-04) of Nevada; Tom Suozzi (NY-03), Laura Gillen (NY-04), Pat Ryan (NY-18) and Josh Riley (NY-19) of New York; Greg Landsman (OH-01), Marcy Kaptur (OH-09), and Emilia Syles (OH-13) of Ohio; Janelle Bynum (OR-05) of Oregon; Henry Cuellar (TX-28) and Vicente Gonzalez (TX-34) of Texas; Eugene Vindman (VA-07) of Virginia; and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (WA-03) of Washington state.

The NRCC says there's a modest ad buy behind the digital spots.

"House Democrats threw a tantrum at the expense of the American people, shutting down the government just to score political points. After months of failure, they've learned nothing and doubled down on their embarrassing dysfunction." NRCC spokesman Mike Marinella said.

Democrats disagree.

"The strong House Democratic vote in opposition to this reckless Republican spending bill speaks for itself," House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the top Democrat in the chamber, told reporters after the vote.

And House Democratic Caucus Chair Rep. Pete Aguilar of California took aim at what he called a "partisan" measure and emphasized that "we put up a strong vote in opposition of this bill because this hurts families."

                Protestors gathered outside the Department of Veterans Affairs headquarters in Washington, DC, US, on Feb. 13, 2025. The agency plans to cut 80,000 jobs.

In the wake of federal firings and executive orders, providers and patients at the Department of Veterans Affairs say mental health and mental health care are suffering.

They fear this struggle will get worse as the VA carries through with 80,000 promised job cuts. The agency is one of the largest providers of mental health care in the country.

"I've been really struggling with my concentration and my ability to focus when I'm at work, because I feel like I have this ax over my head all the time," says a mental health provider who asked NPR not to disclose the location of her work and to identify her only as Lynn, her middle name, for fear she could be fired for speaking out. 

Lynn is especially concerned about her clients who identify as LGBTQ, since one executive order called on federal employees to eliminate "equity related," grants or contracts and another directed them to recognize only two sexes.

Consequently employees at the VA have been directed to remove symbols such as flags that indicate support for transgender or queer rights. "We're kind of skirting around that," says Lynn. "Some people have put up art in their office that says 'Love is love,' or a rainbow. So we're all kind of being subversive."

Therapists in other locations reported similar concern that these patients — already in a marginalized population — are being singled out and targeted for discrimination. They employed strategies similar to Lynn's to silently communicate a message of solidarity to patients who identify as LGBTQ.

These rebellions come with a price.

"If I wear this stuff, am I then gonna become a target from either my patients or maybe my peers?" asks Lynn. "Because there's this culture of, 'you need to rat on people.'"

Employees at the VA have received emails encouraging them to report colleagues who are violating the new ban on diversity, equity and inclusion. There have also been high profile firings in the military of leaders who are Black or female.

Lynn says these changes are destabilizing to patients as well. " We've had patients going to the medical records and asking for their charts to be altered," she says, "to remove references to their gender identity or their sexual orientation because they're fearing that they might be put on a list or that they might be discriminated against."

Some patients who have post-traumatic stress disorder say the changes are especially disconcerting. One woman, who asked to be identified only as D.M., says she's been suffering from near-constant anxiety since the changes began at the VA. She served for 26 years on active duty as a nurse and was sexually assaulted by a fellow service member. She says since then, she's strictly avoided being alone in rooms with men.

"Even if you have to grab the office secretary, you make sure you are not one-on-one with that male, and that's to protect you and to protect him," says D.M.

Receiving both mental and physical health care at an all-women's clinic, she says, has been tremendously helpful. D.M. fears such spaces will be eliminated from veteran and army life." We're gonna get rid of anything that involves women, transgender, you know, all that stuff," she says.

The VA has not announced plans to cut such clinics, and the stated purpose of the executive order D.M. references on gender is to "protect women." In an emailed statement from the VA, spokesperson Peter Kasperowicz wrote, "The VA will always provide veterans, families, caregivers and survivors the health care and benefits they have earned."

Doug Collins, secretary of Veterans Affairs, has promised to preserve "mission critical" positions such as clinicians.

But some VA employees and veterans' advocates warn that getting rid of any staff could compromise care in a system that is predicated on an integrated model of physical and mental health, including research positions.

"Having high quality research is a part of high quality care," says Rashi Romanoff, CEO of a non-profit, The National Association of Veterans' Research and Education Foundations (NAVREF). The group does advocacy for research for veterans and warns that $35 million worth of research that is underway could be lost if the VA does not indefinitely preserve between 350 and 400 clinical trials.

In an emailed statement to NPR, VA spokesperson Kasperowicz said the agency would continue to fund these programs for 90 days "while the department conducts a comprehensive assessment of ongoing research." Trials include research on topics such as suicide mitigation and treatment for substance use disorder, according to NAVREF's data collection.

Nurse practitioner Lynn says going to work everyday feels like she's working on the Titanic. "Half the people on the boat are still in the ballroom partying and 25 percent of them are actively telling me I'm hysterical," she says.

She plans to stay aboard until she has no choice but to save herself.

At Lakeland Robin's job is to spend time with residents, have conversations with them, play games and other activities.

FORT WAYNE, Ind. (WFFT) – Lakeland Rehabilitation and Healthcare Center unveiled a new staff member whose name is Robin the robot.

Robin is an A.I. generated social interactive robot.

At Lakeland, Robin's job is to spend time with residents, have conversations with them, play games and other activities.

The robot will work in the memory care unit specializing with residents that suffer from Alzheimer's and dementia.

“As that disease progresses, they begin to sometimes become a little bit more reclusive as they're not able to communicate as they once were so Robin will really assist in that nature of spending that one-on-one time with each resident," Executive Director Lindsey Floyd said.

Residents got to spend some time with the new staff member before the unveiling.

“I thought it was really interesting, we played a game, she [Robin] told me I'm a genius," resident Donald Boneff.

Lakeland staff learned they would get Robin at the end of 2024. Robin is the second AI-generated robot in long-term care in Indiana.

Floyd says Robin will work a shift of its own.

“Once we unplug her, get her geared up and ready for the day, and then enter the day about 4 o'clock so she'll just bebop around the facility, engage with residents," Floyd said.

Despite a unanimous scientific consensus, health experts are once again defending the safety of childhood vaccines and so-called autism risk.

Health and Human Services (HHS) officials led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., recently confirmed that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will investigate whether vaccines cause autism. 

The public health announcement reignited a longstanding debate over a theory lacking substantial scientific evidence.

“As President Trump said in his Joint Address to Congress, the rate of autism in American children has skyrocketed. CDC will leave no stone unturned in its mission to figure out what exactly is happening,” a department statement said. “The American people expect high quality research and transparency and that is what CDC is delivering.”

Vaccines are widely regarded as safe and effective. However, vaccine skepticism and hesitancy have contributed to low childhood vaccination rates in the United States. 

Vaccinations help prevent the spread of infectious diseases while protecting those who can't receive them. Most health experts agree they do not cause autism.

Experts told Healthline there have been multitudes of reputable studies on the topic over the past 20 years, and none have established a definitive link between autism and childhood vaccines.

“The scientific community has researched this very thoroughly and there's no evidence that childhood vaccine cause autism,” said Danelle Fisher, MD, a pediatrician at Providence Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.

“Scientists from around the world have approached this question in several different ways and none has found a relationship,” added Bryan King, MD, vice chair for child psychiatry and a professor in the school of medicine at the University of California San Francisco. “Scientists have also looked at whether different preservatives in vaccines could have an effect and none exists.”

Experts reaffirmed the importance of children receiving their scheduled vaccinations to prevent infectious and potentially deadly illnesses like measles from spreading. The growing measles outbreak that began in western Texas in January has been linked to low vaccination rates.

“In some ways, we are victims of our success when it comes to vaccines,” King said. “They can be so successful in preventing severe illness and death that we can lose sight of why we need or want to be protected from those potentially devastating diseases. We forget how devastating those diseases are.”

King and other experts noted that vaccinating the majority of children can help protect children who can't receive vaccines because they are undergoing cancer treatment or have compromised immune systems.

“We need to cocoon these kids,” said Gina Posner, MD, a pediatrician at MemorialCare Medical Group in Fountain Valley, CA.

“It is incumbent upon everyone to be good community members,” added Fisher.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a broad term used to describe a group of neurodevelopmental conditions.

The conditions generally affect communication and social interaction. People on the autism spectrum often demonstrate restricted and repetitive interests or patterns of behavior, and language skills are often delayed in children.

The degree to which a person falls on the autism spectrum may vary greatly from person to person. Five subtypes of autism have been identified.

Most people are diagnosed with autism as children, but adults are sometimes diagnosed as well.

Some symptoms of autism may include:

Experts say early intervention when children are young can help ease symptoms and help autistic people improve their quality of life.

“Early intervention is amazing,” Posner told Healthline. Some early intervention therapies for autism may include:

President Donald Trump and HHS Secretary RFK Jr. have quoted figures saying autism rates in the U.S. have skyrocketed from 1 in 10,000 children in 2000 to 1 in 36 children today. The 1 in 10,000 number appears to come from a single study in the 1960s.

The CDC reports that autism rates have more likely increased from 1 in 150 children in 2000 to 1 in 36 today.

The agency also notes that an autism diagnosis is four times more common in boys than it is in girls.

Experts note they believe the increase in autism rates in the past two decades is due to better diagnosis of the condition. King points out that vaccination rates have not increased in the past 10 years while the rate of autism diagnoses has gone up.

“The rate of autism is as much as it's always been. Now, it's just identified better,” Fisher told Healthline.

“A lot of it is we are better at diagnosing,” added Posner.

King added that “the definition of autism now includes a broader spectrum, which may partially explain the increase in prevalence over earlier estimates.”

If vaccines don't cause autism, then what does?

Experts say there are probably a multitude of factors behind the development of autism, but they say the number one reason is most likely genetics, noting that autism tends to be more common in some families than in others.

In 2023, researchers reported they had identified seven genes linked to an increased risk of autism. 

When introducing their research results, they also noted that prior research has estimated that 50% of genetic risk can be predicted by common genetic variation, and another 15% to 20% is due to spontaneous mutations or predictable inheritance patterns.

“None of the hundreds of genes that contribute to the risk for autism is specific, that is, that a so-called autism gene always or only leads to autism,” King told Healthline. 

“But these genes disrupt the usual development or function of pathways in the brain in ways that significantly increase autism risk. The timing of these effects begins before birth, so as scientists look for causes of autism, the focus is on genes or environmental exposures that occur long before children are receiving immunizations,” he added.

Experts said that children of older parents tend to have higher autism risks due to the aging of sperm and eggs. A 2020 study determined that children born to older parents have a 50% higher risk of autism.

Posner added there is also evidence that premature infants have higher autism risks, as do children born to mothers with gestational diabetes.

“You can't specifically point to one cause,” said Fisher. “No two autistic kids are the same.”

Officials at the CDC announced they will study whether childhood vaccines are a potential cause of autism.

Experts say there have been a multitude of scientific studies done on this subject over the past 20 years, and none have concluded that vaccinations are linked to autism risk.

Genetics is likely a top factor for autism risk. Children born to older parents, as well as those born prematurely or to mothers with gestational diabetes, may also have higher risks.

Children should continue to follow their recommended immunization schedules to prevent the spread of disease as well as to protect children who can't receive vaccines.

The first part of this story provided an intimate look at the destruction, and heartbreak, caused by this January's Southern California wildfires. Below is the second part, which explores the Altadena tennis community, and how the world looks now for Altadena and Pacific Palisades.The Anti-Club: Altadena's Diverse MixTennis' role in Altadena has long had its own distinct flavor. According to Craig Sloane, Altadena Town & Country Club manager, his club was probably its second-oldest running business. Beyond the tennis, it was also a significant communal gathering spot. For more than 50 years, the Altadena Rotary Club had met there every Thursday. Over the years, the club had hosted frequent Chamber of Commerce meetings, weddings, celebrations of life, fundraisers for local schools and much more. All of this makes the tragedy of its destruction incredibly widespread and painful.“We call it kind of the anti-club,” said Fred Guerra, the facility's tennis director. “It's obviously a club, but in the sense that it has a very kind of neighborhood quality to it. There's no air of pretentiousness from club members.”

Back in the 1920s, at a time when many California cities had laws that restricted who could buy property, Altadena welcomed Black homeowners.“It's a tight knit community,” said Esther Hendershott, a Pasadena resident who is the USTA Southern California director of community tennis and diversity, equity and inclusion. “Most families that have lived in the Altadena area have lived there for many years, generations of Black and brown families. It's very diverse.”Beyond the club, Altadena residents play tennis at a variety of venues, including Loma Alta Park, Charles S. Farnsworth Park and John Muir High School. For now, though, these courts are filled with debris—ash, dirt, leaves.“People are in shock, walking around numb,” says Hendershott.Selwyn Brereton, an Altadena resident and co-owner of Pasadena-based iTennis, noted that many Altadena-based players have made their way to Pasadena and the courts at Eaton Blanche Park.“They've formed a nice little community and communicating on a regular basis,” he said. “It's brought a lot of us back to together . . . with everybody trying to help each other.”

“I'm crushed to see so much loss,” said Ron Hightower, a former ATP pro who has taught tennis in the Palisades for more than 30 years, including a decade as the head pro at Riviera. “People who have lost their homes and love tennis have lost that ability, at least for now. It breaks my heart.”Said former ATP pro Chuck Adams, “To literally lose your whole hometown in one night, it's just stifling on the soul. I feel a dark spot in my heart over it, and that even bothers me more than losing my house.”“It was just surreal to see the neighborhood and club completely wiped out,” said Guerra. “It's still numbing.”Sloane has estimated that of his club's approximately 640 member units, more than 100 have lost their homes.“It's heartbreaking to talk to the members and hear their stories,” he said.

The USTA Southern California section, Pasadena residents, and others are rallying to help Altadena. Among its many efforts to aid fire victims, the section is donating shoes and equipment. Nearby clubs are figuring out ways to provide court access for displaced members, as well as for local instructors and their students.“Tennis has an opportunity right now to really support everyone affected by the fires,” said Hendershott.Hall of Famer Gigi Fernandez, through her newly established non-profit, Tennis for Hope, has recently announced plans to provide support for the rebuilding of Palisades Tennis Center.

Chris Boyer, a former longstanding USTA Southern California board member, is also creating ways to generate sustained awareness. Throughout March, as his son plays the BNP Paribas Open and the Miami Open, he'll donate $200 to the fire-affected, Altadena-based Badon Tennis Academy every time Tristan serves an ace. The donation will be matched (up to $5,000) by the Altadena-based 24 Hour Fitness center he works out at when back home.“I hope people can try to help out as much as they can,” said Tristan, “and keep Altadena the way it was before this happened and keep the character of it as much as possible, so we can recover from what happened.”

“It's going to take a little while before we can get back,” said Sloane. “I would assume months, and I can't say specifically how many months. We have to get our utilities back. We have to clean up the facilities. We have to make sure it's safe for us to come back, in terms of air quality, and the ability to provide services.”Brereton is also a USTA official, working at many tournaments throughout Southern California.

Westwood Park, roughly seven miles east of Palisades Tennis Center, has become the new practice spot for the Pali High tennis team. Tomas has many plans to support the devastated Palisades community, including conducting a fundraiser at Cheviot Hills on April 26.“We want to be givers,” he said. “That's the spirit of the Palisades.”And though Tomas is also aware that it will take at least several months for the tennis facility to reopen, he's committed to making it happen.“There's always been a sense of magic in the air when it comes to tennis here,” he says.“Palisades has to have a tennis center,” said Howard Sands, a former pro whose two sons play tennis at Palisades High. “I cannot imagine this community without it.”

On Sunday, February 2, just over three weeks after the fire had started, longtime Palisades resident Wally Marks and I resumed tennis as usual, meeting at 7:00 a.m. at Cheviot Hills Recreation Center. Since he always has items shipped to his office, Wally indeed brought the case of Wilson balls. Because his racquet needed to be restrung, he'd left it in his car that awful Tuesday. But Wally was also wearing new tennis clothes.“There's a sense of wanting to be normal again,” he said after our hitting session.On a Friday afternoon just over three weeks after the fire, I went to Westwood Park, watched the Pali team practice, and spoke with coach Bud Kling.“It was easier to resign myself that my house was going to burn down than have all this hope that it wasn't,” he said. “Psychologically, though, people deal with it differently. To me, it's like tennis: sometimes you just get the ball in. I know people don't always agree with this, but I see the silver lining: we get to design our own house the way we want.”

Altadena, Palisades and its neighboring town, Malibu, have a combined population of 75,000. It's estimated that among these three communities, more than 18,000 structures have been destroyed. Eleven players on Kling's teams have lost their homes. All were evacuated. None are currently living in the Palisades. As I watched the players hit serves, drive their forehands and backhands, and run around the courts, Kling told me, “The parents say, ‘this is the highlight of their day.' They're very appreciative that we're providing something that's normal.”In many cases, dread and anxiety are defined by anticipation of what might happen. In this instance, dread and anxiety are defined by what did happen. As residents of Altadena and Pacific Palisades attempt to absorb, assess, heal, rebuild and move forward, some can take comfort in past pictures gathered as they hurried to evacuate. Others were unable to salvage those beloved memory triggers. But all touched by this tragedy will persistently come face-to-face with an eternal principle: We may be through with the past, but the past is never through with us.Joel Drucker feels grateful that, while living less than a mile from an evacuation line, it was not necessary for him to leave his home. He will be reporting more on these communities in the months to come.

Andy Roddick and Rafael Nadal crossed paths on several occasions, competing at the sport's biggest tournaments.

The American and Spanish stars played one another ten times on the ATP Tour, as one player enjoyed far more success than the other.

Nadal won seven of their ten matches, while Roddick won just three, at the US Open in 2004, the Dubai Tennis Championships in 2008, and the Miami Open in 2010.

Both players won Major titles and reached world number one during their careers, although Nadal's spell at the top lasted longer than Roddick's as he won 21 more Slams and held the number one ranking for 196 more weeks.

Roddick retired from tennis in 2012, 12 years before the Spaniard did so in 2024 following the conclusion of the Davis Cup.

Nadal's longevity in the sport had been praised throughout his career, as Roddick now admits he wasn't too sure the 22-time Major champion would stick around for as long as he did.

Roddick interviewed Nadal on his Served with Andy Roddick podcast recently and admitted that he got something ‘extremely wrong' about the legendary Spanish star.

“You know he has had a lot of injuries,” he said.

“He plays so physical, it's not super surprising.

“I thought he was going to be done by 27 or 28 years old, if I am being honest.

“His longevity is something that I got extremely wrong.”

Nadal won his final Major title at the 2022 French Open as a 35-year-old, making him the sixth oldest Grand Slam champion in Open Era history.

Roddick then spoke about the foot injury that caused Nadal problems during the latter stages of his career, describing it as ‘gross.'

“He took his shoe off, there is a gremlin coming out his foot,” said Roddick.

“I said to him that it looked like his foot was pregnant, it looked like his foot was pregnant.

“He's tough.

“There is something living in there, he thinks it's a tennis injury, it's kind of like a beehive that is about to explode or something, it was gross.”

Nadal also named the year he first injured his foot back at the beginning of his tennis career.

“He said he first hurt that foot at the end of 2005,” said Roddick.

“He said 2005 was a good year, I won 11 times on tour.”

He may have struggled with injury but that didn't stop him from enjoying one of the best years of his career in 2005, as Nadal picked up 11 ATP titles.

Only his rival Roger Federer could match him 20 years ago, also picking up 11 titles, as the Spaniard truly developed into one of the best players in men's tennis.

Nadal won his first Major title at the French Open in 2005, battling back from a set down to beat Mariano Puerta on Court Philippe Chatrier.

He won 11 of his 12 finals in 2005, with his only defeat coming at the hands of his greatest rival, Federer, at the Miami Open.

In a Floridian thriller, Federer secured his first career victory over Nadal having lost to him at the same venue one year earlier.

The Swiss star took home the title after five sets of grueling action, 2-6, 6-7, 7-6, 6-3, 6-1.

Nadal retired from tennis in 2024 having never won more titles in a year than he did in 2005, as he racked up the wins regardless of injury.

Tennis

INDIAN WELLS, Calif. — It's an annual ritual. Players descend on the California desert and almost universally declare it an ideal location for a major tennis tournament. The sun, the dry air, the luxe accommodations, the jagged hills and mountains that loom just beyond the Indian Wells Tennis Garden outside Palm Springs.

Then they take to the purple and green hard courts with the big bounces that usually only happen on red clay. Another collective shout goes up, and it's not so adoring.

“Hey, wait a minute, I thought this was supposed to be a hard court.”

This year, they might have arrived thinking that things were going to be different. Tournament organizers had selected a new company to surface the courts, the same provider that does the U.S. Open and the Miami Open, which follows Indian Wells on the tennis calendar. Finally, this desert enclave was going to play like the faster hard courts that ATP and WTA Tour players have gotten used to in the U.S..

But it's as slow and bouncy as ever.

“Kind of the same court, really slow, bounce a lot,” Carlos Alcaraz said Monday night, after beating the dangerous Denis Shapovalov 6-2, 6-4. “They said that they changed it, but if nobody told me that I would think it is the same.”

Daniil Medvedev, who two years ago famously threatened to “pee as slow as this court is” while declaring himself a hard-court expert, showed up last week and said he thought the court was as slow and gritty as ever. “Very, very slow,” Medvedev, runner-up in 2023 and 2024, said of the courts.

The Russian, who beat Tommy Paul 6-4, 6-0 in the round of 16 Tuesday, said that when he accidentally dropped his racket during practice, the grittiness of the court ripped his grip as it slid across the ground.

In the past, the Indian Wells playing surface was fashioned by Plexipave. This year, Laykold came on board. In both cases, the courts have three layers: Asphalt or concrete on the bottom, a softer acrylic or silicone surface on top of that, and then surface paint that contains varying amounts of sand.

Tommy Haas, the former player who is tournament director at Indian Wells, said organizers listened to the complaints from the players last year and decided it was time at least try to speed up the courts.

“The outside courts seem to be a little bit quicker than Stadium One and Stadium Two,” Haas said in an interview Tuesday. “Stadium One seems to be the slowest. So we're trying to adjust, looking at numbers and trying to figure out how to keep all the courts as even as possible. That's what we want for the players.”

In general, the more sand in the paint, the slower the court and the higher the bounce. The physics involved is to do with trajectory and velocity. On clay — and a court like Indian Wells — an incoming ball of equal speed and the same trajectory will retain less speed and bounce more steeply than the same ball would on a faster hard court, or on grass. Topspin, something every player needs in varying degrees, will have more impact on a court with more friction, kicking the ball higher into the air. The sand in the paint at Indian Wells increases friction, which is why there are more balls spitting upward than skidding low.

Add in the dry desert air, which lets a ball fly faster than more humid conditions, and what every player who comes to Indian Wells has to learn to deal with is the contrast between how fast the ball travels when it's airborne and how dramatically it slows down when it hits the ground.

“It's hard to hit a winner and hit through your serves here,” Coco Gauff said after her 7-6(1), 6-2 win over Maria Sakkari Monday.

“Sometimes you hit a good shot and you think it's a great shot and your opponent is there. I think it's testing the patience out here.”

Some players get hot and bothered about surfaces and changes. Some don't mind much at all. There are two mostly unspoken but very important truths about surface discussion in tennis. One is that a surface plays to its weather conditions and, at Indian Wells, it's possible to run the gamut of desert heat to icy windstorm across the course of a day and night.

The other is that how a tennis court plays is partly beholden to the players playing on it. Someone with a ton of pop on their serve and monstrous groundstrokes who plays at midday in the sun is going to find things fast. Someone who specializes in maneuvering and defense who plays at night in slanting wind is going to find them slow. The beauty of the court is in the eye of the beholder.

Iga Swiatek, who has won here twice and is the defending champion, looks imperious the moment she arrives. She loves slow courts. She loves high bounces. She loves to see her killer forehand fly through the air. Indian Wells allows for all three. So far her title defense has included three matches, two 6-0 bagels and just 42 games in which she is 36-6. She has won 16 of her 21 return games. She likes it out here.

“It gives me a little bit of an advantage,” Swiatek said. “But on the other hand the conditions are tricky still with the really dry air.”

Alcaraz, who is going for a third title in a row in the men's draw, loves it for the same reasons. So does Stefanos Tsitsipas, on an upswing with his new racket and the feeling of swinging freely with it in hand.

“I've played my entire life with bounces like this,” Tsitsipas said after beating Matteo Berrettini. “The bounce is unusual for a hard court.”

It's true that Indian Wells bounces higher than most hard courts and it would be a sad tennis tour if all hard courts played as close to the same as is possible when factoring in weather and geography. That said, what every player craves at every tournament is consistency. They want the ball to behave uniformly across the grounds, even if that's not really possible, either.

Novak Djokovic, probably the best hard-court player to ever pick up a racket and a five-time winner in Indian Wells, was not particularly pleased with the conditions after his opening match loss to Botic van de Zandschulp over the weekend. Djokovic struggled to find his rhythm all afternoon against the Dutchman. Shots that looked like they were headed into his strike zone seemed to handcuff him, jumping around his midriff.

“The difference between the center court and the other courts is immense,” Djokovic said in his news conference. “The ball is bouncing on the center court higher than some of the highest clay courts.”

At 37, he might never play in this so-called tennis paradise again.

Aryna Sabalenka, the women's world No. 1 who will likely have to get through Swiatek in a final to win here, said she even thought there were “some questionable parts of the court where the ball doesn't bounce at all or the ball goes really high up.”

“It's just a very minimal amount of of whining at times, trying to find the balance that they would like at the end of the day,” Haas said of the extent of player complaints.

“But again, if you do well at tournaments, you usually quickly forget if the ball bounces a little higher or a little lower, or how fast it goes through the court. At the end of the day, it's all about winning.”

Multiple factors contribute to how fast or slow the tennis ball moves on any particular court. The ball itself. The air temperature and the humidity. Given its desert location, Indian Wells doesn't produce much humidity, but it gets seriously chilly at night, with temperatures often hovering in the low-50s, and that's when things go slower. But on a hot, dry, and mostly still Monday afternoon, things got interesting for Alex de Minaur in his match against Hubert Hurkacz. The latter's kick serve — which players most often hit to their opponent's backhand, trying to get them to hit it above their shoulders — left him with a bad case of the giggles.

De Minaur won 6-4, 6-0, but said that dealing with Hurkacz's second serve was “laughable at times. I felt like I needed a step ladder.”

“The surface speed feels exactly the same speed as different years,” De Minaur added. “What makes for completely different conditions is the weather.”

No one would have any issues with that. But that also sort of assumes that all the courts play the same, which they don't. Not here, not anywhere, which is the point Djokovic was making. At most tournament sites, the outer courts get far more play than the stadium courts. That smooths them out by comparison and makes them slicker than their show-court counterparts.

Ben Shelton, who plays compatriot Brandon Nakashima in the round of 16, said he arrived in Indian Wells about a week early. He got plenty of practice on the two main stadium courts, and also on the outer courts. He's with Djokovic on this one.

“I think at every hard court tournament the center court is slower, checks up more,” Shelton said Saturday after his win against Mariano Navone of Argentina. “I feel the same with Rod Laver (Arena, in Melbourne, Australia), I feel the same with Ashe (Arthur Ashe Stadium, N.Y.),” he added, referring to the two main courts at the Australian and U.S. Opens.

Shelton put that knowledge and the favorable climate to work on Monday, during a tight contest with Karen Khachanov of Russia.

When things got close in the second set, Shelton started banging 150mph serves right at Khachanov, who could barely get out of the way. When Khachanov focused on avoiding that serve, Shelton started kicking balls out wide.

“I get the most out of those serves here because it is so hard to bring the ball down into the court,” he said, after winning 6-3, 7-5.

There is another approach to all this, the one favored by world No. 11 Tommy Paul. “I'm the worst guy to ask about this stuff,” he said. “I don't even think about it. I just go out there and play.”

He was still alive — until Indian Wells' chief hater, Medvedev, took him to task. Perception is nine-tenths of the law.

 WTA/Jimmie48
                        


WTA Staff


The BNP Paribas Open quarterfinals are set for the bottom half of the draw, which are scheduled to be played on Wednesday. 

Two-time champion Iga Swiatek's quest for a historic third Indian Wells title remains in play. But to move one step closer, Swiatek must avenge her heartbreaking Olympic loss to World No. 9 Zheng Qinwen. 

Indian Wells: Draws | Scores | Order of play

The other quarterfinal sees 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva take on former No. 3 Elina Svitolina for the first time. Can the teen phenom take her WTA 1000 win streak to double digits? 

Here's how Wednesday's matchups stack up:

Head-to-head: Swiatek leads 6-1

It's been 23 years since a woman lost just six games on her way to the Indian Wells quarterfinal. With a string of gaudy 6-2, 6-0, 6-0, 6-2, 6-1, 6-1 set scores, Swiatek has matched Monica Seles' feat of just six games lost in 2002. 

It's been one of those weeks for Swiatek, who has dismantled Caroline Garcia, Dayana Yastremska, and most impressively, Karolina Muchova. The defending champion has shown once again that desert conditions tend to suit her well -- let's not forget she's a three-time champion in Doha. And for all the talk of the courts possibly playing faster this year, Swiatek's quick performances have quieted those whispers quickly.

Next up is a resurgent Zheng. She came into Indian Wells without back-to-back wins this year but has found her game and her joy to make her first quarterfinal of the year. Zheng has not lost a set, beating Victoria Azarenka, Lulu Sun, and 18th seed Marta Kostyuk. 

Zheng's improved play coincides with her reunion with coach Pere Riba, who underwent hip surgery in November and could not join Zheng as he rehabilitated. Zheng began the year with a pair of interim coaches and Riba was able to return just in time for the Sunshine Double. 

Riba was at the helm when Zheng notched the biggest win of her career at the Paris Olympics last summer, where the 22-year-old toppled Swiatek on Court Philippe Chatrier in the semifinals en route to the gold medal. The 6-2, 7-5 win was Zheng's first over the Pole, and it snapped Swiatek's 26-match win streak on the hallowed grounds of Roland Garros.

Swiatek still owns the lopsided head-to-head, but their matches have been close. Three of Swiatek's wins needed three sets.

Head-to-head: First meeting

Three weeks ago, Andreeva stormed through the field at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships to become the youngest WTA 1000 champion in the format's 16-year history. Now she's taken that win streak to nine matches, and the prospect of her snagging a second WTA 1000 trophy doesn't feel too far off. 

Andreeva has been outstanding in Indian Wells. She has not lost a set, and she has been dominant. She lost just three games to Clara Tauson in a rematch of the Dubai final and then roared past 2023 champion Elena Rybakina to win 6-1, 6-2 in the Round of 16. She has played not like a young player burdened by expectations, but one who has extracted confidence from them. She's worked with her sports psychologist to turn the chatter into motivation.

"It's easier for me to think these people are saying this because they want to put pressure on me, and they put pressure on me because probably they are afraid of the way I play.

"So it's easier for me to think that. It helps me to go on the court with kind of anger, not to prove everyone that I really can do it, but to prove myself that I'm strong enough to handle the pressure and to really win these high-quality matches."

As she looks to win her 10th straight match, Andreeva will have a new challenge to solve. She has never played Svitolina, who is coming off a resilient three-set win over No. 4 Jessica Pegula. That win, which boosted Svitolina into her first WTA 1000 quarterfinal since 2021, ended the American's seven-match win streak. Can Svitolina spoil another? 

"I know that she's a fighter," Andreeva said, "she runs for every ball. Now she's also playing a little bit more aggressive.

"But all the small details, it's Conchita's job to prepare me."

Iga Swiatek continued her sensational winning form at Indian Wells by crushing Karolina Muchova 6-1 6-1 to reach the quarter-finals of the BNP Paribas Open.

Swiatek brushed aside the Czech 15th seed in just 57 minutes and has marched into the last eight for the loss of only six games in total over three matches.

Second seed Swiatek has now won her last 16 matches in the California desert in straight sets with her semi-final defeat to Elena Rybakina two years ago her only blemish since 2021.

🎾18 sets won, 0 sets lost
🎾 27 games dropped in total
🎾 5 sets with 6-0 score
🎾 4 sets with 6-1 score
🎾 AVERAGE set score is 6-1


On Thursday Swiatek will face Qinwen Zheng, who beat Marta Kostyuk 6-3 6-2.

Annabel Croft speaking on Sky Sports Tennis:

"It wasn't much of a contest right from the word go when she was broken in that opening game. She hadn't got enough first serves in and it kind of went from bad to worse where she struggled to get on the scoreboard," said the former British No 1.

"She did well to get the two games she did to be honest with you. I just think these conditions did not suit Muchova at all. She couldn't keep the ball going or stay with Swiatek in those slow baseline exchanges.

"Swiatek looks so comfortable. She's not rushed, she's balanced on all the groundstrokes, she creates the angles and she is rock solid at the back."

Mirra Andreeva eliminated Elena Rybakina, the 2022 Wimbledon champion, at Indian Wells.

The 17-year old took a dominant 6-1 6-2 victory to progress to the quarter-finals.

"Today was a great match," Andreeva said. "I knew that it's going to be tough, but I just tried to go on court and do my best, so I'm just super happy with my win today and can't wait to play my next round here."

Andreeva will face Elina Svitolina in the last eight after the Ukrainian beat fourth seed Jessica Pegula, a US Open finalist.

Svitolina won in three sets, 5-7 6-1 6-2.

"I got a little bit angry [after losing the first set], a little bit fired up in that second set and tried to play better tennis," Svitolina said.

"I'm really happy with the way I was able to stay composed, even after the rain delay."

Holger Rune overcame Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-4 6-4 in the fourth round to snap the Greek's seven-match winning streak.

The Dane struck 22 winners and hit one of the shots of the season to crucially save a break point in the second set.

He scampered to the baseline and instinctively hit a tweener lob that landed on the baseline.

"I think it was an extremely good match from my side from start to finish," Rune said. "I stayed very committed on my game plan and mentally I was very good. I think that made the difference, how composed I could start. Because Stef is back in shape I think it is fair to say. It was a cool battle."

"The tweener is the first thing I am going to check when I check my phone. That was better than I expected," Rune added.

Elina Svitolina said she had received an outpouring of support from Americans after the US president Donald Trump's extraordinary clash with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House last month.

Svitolina thanked Americans for their “unwavering support” and “compassion” in a social media post on Sunday after beating Danielle Collins in the third round of Indian Wells. After defeating another local hope Jessica Pegula 5-7, 6-1, 6-2 on Tuesday to move into the quarter-finals, Svitolina told reporters she had received solid support at the tournament in the California desert.

“I feel like since that meeting in the Oval Office, I got a lot of messages of support from the American people and a lot of people here when I arrived at the tournament, giving love and support to Ukrainians for people back at home,” she said. “Also the massive support that I got taking in consideration that I played three American girls back-to-back. It's amazing, really special to get that, taking into consideration all the stress that all Ukrainians are facing right now back at home.”

After the Ukrainian dropped the first set, she rallied before the weather interrupted proceedings early in the third set. “I got a little bit angry [about losing the first set], a little bit fired up in that second set and tried to play better tennis,” Svitolina said. “I'm really happy with the way I was able to stay composed, even after the rain delay.” Pegula entered the day with a seven-match winning streak that included a tournament title in Austin, Texas.

Svitolina next faces the Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva in the quarter-finals. Ukrainian players have been boycotting the post-match tradition of shaking hands at the net when taking on opponents from Russia and Belarus, which is a staging ground for the invasion.

Earlier, Iga Swiatek walloped Karolina Muchova 6-1, 6-1 to book her place in the last eight, continuing her relentless march through the tournament with another lopsided victory.

The Polish former world No 1 has only dropped six games since arriving at the event and brushed aside her Czech opponent with a near-flawless performancethat included just four errors against a dozen winners while never facing a break point.

“Honestly, sometimes matches can be pretty weird,” Swiatek, the Indian Wells champion in 2022 and 2024, said after the 57-minute victory. “It's enough for one player to not feel perfect and the other feel great. Then suddenly the difference is much bigger than it usually is. It's tennis. Things like that can happen. For sure, I used my opportunities and I used my chances. It's not easy, but, well, I can imagine that it looks like it.”

Swiatek is one of 10 women who have two championships in the Southern California event, and she is aiming to be the first to prevail three times. She got her latest victory out of the way before a rainstorm that paused all action. “I knew this big cloud is coming and probably if I'm not going to finish then I'm going to wait a bit,” Swiatek said. “On [the] last two games, it was a bit slippery already, but I really wanted to finish. So I kind of played more risky – but the shots were still in.”

After waiting through a rain delay, Swiatek took immediate hold of the momentum, sprinting through the first four games and not dropping a first-serve point in the opening set. Muchova, who enjoyed an inspired run to the US Open semi-final last year after recovering from wrist surgery, was unable to find her level in the second set as the mistakes piled up.

Swiatek closed it out in 57 minutes with an unreturnable serve to set up a meeting with either Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen of China or Ukrainian Marta Kostyuk who meet later, weather permitting.

                            2025 Indian Wells
                        

Mirra Andreeva ousted Elena Rybakina from a tournament for the second time in three weeks on a rainy Tuesday night at the BNP Paribas Open, advancing to the quarterfinals behind a commanding 6-1, 6-2 performance. 

Indian Wells: Draws | Scores | Order of play

The 17-year-old needed three sets to beat Rybakina on her way to winning the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships last month, but had no such troubles in a dominating 1 hour and 3-minute performance inside Stadium 2 at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden -- against a player who lifted the trophy at the tournament two years ago. Andreeva won six straight games in coasting to the first set -- her momentum only disrupted by a rain delay in the fourth game -- and also won four straight games in the second set, quickly resetting after losing serve at the start.

"I knew that the match was going to be incredibly tough," Andreeva said post-match. "She's won the tournament here, I think she feels very comfortable playing on these courts, so I just found a great mindset for this match and I just tried to fight for every point. 

"I was so excited to play tonight ... with all the courage, I just went on court and tried to show the best level of tennis."

Andreeva has now won nine straight matches, and is the youngest player through to the Indian Wells quarterfinals since Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova also did it at 17 in 2009. Read on for more facts and figures from Andreeva's latest triumph.

0: Rybakina did not hit an ace against Andreeva, and was broken six times. The 2022 Wimbledon champion entered the tournament second on the Hologic WTA Tour in total aces this season behind Clara Tauson.

3: All three of the matches between Andreeva and Rybakina have come at WTA 1000 events -- but Tuesday's affair was the first to not go three sets. Rybakina previously won at the 2023 China Open from a set down, but Andreeva has now won back-to-back matches in the head-to-head -- and pushed her season record against Top 10 opponents to 3-2 in the process. 

4: The big-hitting Rybakina struck just four winners against Andreeva, who hit 19 winners.

5: Since the format's introduction in 2009, Andreeva is now the first player to reach five WTA 1000 quarterfinals before the age of 18. She entered Tuesday's match tied with Coco Gauff.

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

7: The victory was Andreeva's seventh against a Top 10 player in her young career. Since 2000, only Maria Sharapova (10) and Kim Clijsters (eight) have claimed more Top 10 victories before turning 18.

9: Andreeva's nine-match winning streak in a career best at Hologic WTA Tour level, though she won 16 straight matches when counting ITF World Tennis Tour results in 2023. All nine of those wins have come at WTA 1000 level, and she is the youngest player to win that many at this tournament level since the format's introduction.

33: Rybakina totaled 33 unforced errors in two sets -- nearly double Andreeva's total of 19. 

Andreeva will look to extend her unbeaten run to double figures when she faces former World No. 3 Elina Svitolina for the first time in the quarterfinals.

Rafael Nadal won 22 Major titles as a professional, cementing his legacy as one of the sport's greatest ever players.

The Spanish star dominated the ATP Tour alongside his two greatest rivals, Roger Federer, and Novak Djokovic for decades as they collected tennis' biggest prizes.

Nadal won 22 Grand Slams, including a record-breaking 14 French Open titles, eight more than any other player achieved in the Open Era.

His performances helped tennis develop into the sport it is today, as fans around the world tuned in to see Nadal compete throughout his career.

When Nadal retired from tennis in 2024 many questioned who would help drive the sport forward in his absence.

Speaking after his retirement, the 38-year-old has now named the three players he thinks will help continue to grow the sport.

Appearing as a guest on the Served with Andy Roddick podcast, Nadal was full of praise for his fellow Spaniard, who he thinks will do great things in the sport.

“I think Carlos [Alcaraz] is a great kid, a great guy, with a very good family behind him with positive values,” he said.

“They're humble, good persons, that's why I think Carlos is how he is, because at the end the values you receive at home, the way you are educated is the way you show up.”

Nadal and Alcaraz played doubles together at the 2024 Olympic Games, reaching the quarter-finals of the tournament before falling to defeat against the American pair of Rajeev Ram and Austin Krajicek.

Nadal then named two other players he thinks will help push the sport in the right direction.

“I see the same with Iga [Swiatek], I think Jannik [Sinner] is another good guy, not much of a show-off, focuses on what he is doing,” said Nadal.

“Of course, he went through a very tough process in the last year, and it was amazing the way that he was able to keep focused on what he's doing.

“I think it's a new generation of great tennis players there that are going to keep helping this beautiful sport grow and to engage fans.”

Swiatek has spoken freely about her admiration for Nadal, fulfilling a lifelong dream when she played alongside him in a charity match in 2022.

Nadal said he was impressed by Sinner's ‘focus', having endured a tough time in 2025, recently receiving a three-month suspension from the sport.

The Italian world number one is set to return to action at the Italian Open in May in front of his home fans.

In short, the answer is of course no, as Nadal's rival Djokovic continues to compete on the ATP Tour, having won a record 24 Major titles to date.

After the Serb, however, there are few ‘active' tennis players that can match the career achievements of the trio Nadal spoke so fondly of.

WTA star Swiatek is leading the charge with five, as she looks to chase down Djokovic's record of 24 Slams.

The Pole will head to the French Open in May as the heavy favorite to pick up the title, having dominated at the event over recent years.

Swiatek beat Paolini in the 2024 French Open final to take home her fourth title at Roland Garros and her fifth Major in total.

A sixth title for Swiatek could be on the horizon, as could a fifth for Alcaraz, who won his maiden French Open crown in 2024.

The Spaniard will look to bounce back from a tough Australian Open tournament, where he lost in the quarter-finals to Djokovic.

Only time will tell how the stars of the ATP and WTA Tour perform at the French Open, but it will certainly be worth a watch when tennis heads to Paris on Sunday, May 25.

Tyler Cameron's hometown date on The Bachelorette season 15 wasn't actually filmed in his own house.

“My mom busted her a– [and] I learned she painted the house, she had my aunts, uncles [and] everyone over there working their tails off to get this house looking good,” Cameron, 32, recalled in a Tuesday, March 11, TikTok video. “It was really beat-up and as she did all that work, the Bachelorette producers told us, ‘It's too small. It's not going to work.'”

According to Cameron, his family hosted lead Hannah Brown “from my cousin's house.”

“We hosted the dinner and hangout there,” Cameron recalled. “I was very upset about this. I was like, ‘I grew up in this house. I've lived there since I was a baby. It's the first house I lived in. This means a lot to me.' Didn't matter.”



Cameron appeared on Brown's season of The Bachelorette in 2019, eventually introducing her to his loved ones during a Florida hometown date. In addition to meeting his whole family at a cousin's residence, the contractor took Brown, now 30, on a boat excursion.

“To make matters worse, the boat that I went on wasn't even my boat. And why? Because they said my boat was too small,” he further claimed. “I told Hannah. I was like, ‘This isn't my boat. This isn't my house. I'm not trying to front.'”

According to Cameron, he was “pissed off” that he couldn't film in his real properties. (The Bachelor franchise has not publicly addressed Cameron's claims though many other show alums have also alleged they filmed hometowns in different houses for similar reasons.)

“But, it is what it is. I can't do anything about it,” Cameron concluded. “Lesson of the story: It's not about the size of the boat, it's about the size of the motion in the ocean. That's all.”

He added, “It pisses me off when they do that, like, let's be real. [I'll] show you my little-a– house that I grew up in since I was a baby, show you the holes in the wall. I don't care.”

Cameron was the runner-up on Brown's season and they've since remained friendly as they each romantically moved on with Tate Madden and Adam Woolard, respectively. He even reunited with Brown for a 2024 episode of his Going Home renovation docuseries.

“I really had a call and a favor for her,” Cameron exclusively told Us Weekly in April 2024. “I really needed her to do this for me because my designer Jess [Quintero] was too busy. She's like, ‘Ty, I can't do this anymore.' I go, ‘Jess, this is my dream home to renovate. We have to find a way to do this.'”

He added, “[Hannah] came down and she was a rock star. She had a beautiful design. She worked her butt off and she was a complete pro and just so great to work with. I think we had to iron some things out, but I thought we worked out honestly better than expected. I was curious to see how it was going to be, but she's such a trooper and she did such a great job.”

Brown worked as an interior designer before appearing on Colton Underwood's season of The Bachelor, which aired ahead of her own journey as the lead.

Millie Bobby Brown's new blonde hair caused a stir online, and now she's switching it up yet again — for a brief bit with Jimmy Fallon.

While on the Tuesday, March 11 episode of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, the 21-year-old Stranger Things star sat down for an interview — during which she discussed her marriage to Jon Bon Jovi's son, Jake Bongiovi — and also participated in the "Slay It, Don't Spray It" segment with Fallon, during which the actors competed against each other to see who could remember the most '90s lyrics in a karaoke-style competition.

Because the game involved getting hosed in the face — if The Electric State star couldn't finish the lyrics, she'd be sprayed in the face by water; if Fallon couldn't, he would be — both stars had to wear black, thick-rimmed "safety glasses."

"Safety is sexy," the 50-year-old late-night host noted, putting on the rectangular frames himself. As the camera panned to Brown, also clad in the glasses, the audience let out a few whoops and cheers.

Though the thick frames — which looked more like regular glasses than safety googles — were only for the game, they completely transformed Brown's look, giving her glamorous ensemble an academic-like edge.

Over the past week, Brown has been candid about how critics have reacted to her new look — particularly those who say "she looks 40."

On a new episode of Alex Cooper's Call Her Daddy podcast, the British star got real about the harsh criticism.

"You did meet me when I was 10," she said, referring to her starring role on Stranger Things. "My face like, grew. What do you want me to do about that?" she asked. "I'm in a place where, yeah, my accent does change [from British to American]. My face does grow. I do wear a lot of makeup. It's just the kind of person I am."

Brown — who referred to the criticism as "standards and stigmas against girls" — urged the media to "learn how to speak to people, be kind and just understand that we're all growing people, we all make mistakes."

The 47-year-old This Is Us actor was spotted in short shorts, putting his muscular legs on display, while leaving the gym on Tuesday afternoon (March 11) in Los Angeles.

Milo and his wife Jarah Mariano announced that they welcomed their first child, named Ke'ala Coral Ventimiglia, on January 23! 

Two weeks before the baby's birth, Milo and Jarah, 41, sadly lost their home in the devastating Los Angeles wildfires.

While announcing Ke'ala's birth, Jarah reflected on evacuating their home before the it burned down, while also sharing her optimism for the future.

Milo will next be seen in the movie Kill Him 'Til He's Dead, which is in post-production right now.

Temptation Island is back!

The reality TV show arrived with a new twist on Netflix today (Wednesday, March 12), with all 10 one-hour episodes dropping at the same time. 

You can watch it now on Netflix.

The series originally premiered on Fox back in 2001 through 2003. In 2019, USA Network revived the show for a season. And now, in 2025, Netflix is airing the latest season of the long-running dating series.

Keep reading to find out more…

Here's a synopsis: “In this brand new season of Temptation Island, coming to Netflix, emotions run high when four couples, each at a crossroads in their relationship, head to Temptation Island to put their love to the ultimate test as they agree to live separately with a group of singles of the opposite sex. Will the choices they make push the couples closer together or farther apart into the arms of a new lover?”

In a new twist, there will be a “Temptation Haven,” a tent outside each villa that will have no cameras allowing for people to have true alone time. But whenever someone goes in, a red light is sent to the other villa.

Each week, host Mark L. Wahlberg sits down with the men and women separately, and they will be shown out-of-context clips of what their significant other has been up to on the island. Each couple will decide if they want to stay together, leave alone or leave with a new partner.

Find out which shows Netflix just renewed and cancelled in 2025.

Landman is returning for a second season at Paramount+!

“Landman was one of the biggest shows of the year because of Taylor Sheridan's unique ability to tap into the cultural zeitgeist, harnessing the Neo-western themes of rugged individualism, ambition and working-class struggles set against contemporary debates around energy, climate change and economic growth. The series has helped drive Paramount+ to new heights as the No. 2 SVOD [service] in the U.S. for original hours watched in Q4,” Chris McCarthy, co-CEO of Paramount and president and CEO of Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios and Paramount Media Networks, said in a statement.

Billy Bob Thornton, Demi Moore, Andy Garcia, Ali Larter, Jacob Lofland, Michelle Randolph, Kayla Wallace, and more star.

Paramount+ canceled one other TV show this year, while they also renewed a huge hit.

Kate Hudson nearly had a mega wardrobe malfunction.

While promoting her new Netflix show, "Running Point," at the Paley Center for Media recently, the actress — accompanied by her costars onstage — was mid-sentence when a section of her black dress seemed to suddenly shift.

"Oh," Hudson responded while quickly grabbing her chest.

Costar Justin Theroux swiftly tended to her and attempted to adjust a clasp in the back of her dress.

"You didn't expect this," Hudson joked to the audience, while Brenda Song tried to block the actress from the audience's point of view as Theroux worked on her dress.

"Just keep talking," Theroux quipped.

Nearly 30 minutes into the conversation, Hudson's dress seemed to shift again. Theroux was able to adjust her dress yet again while everyone had a good laugh.

Hudson is not the only actress who has been at the center of an embarrassing wardrobe malfunction recently.

"Mean Girls" star Amanda Seyfried revealed her "boobs fell out" of her dress while speaking to Glen Powell at the 2023 Critics Choice Awards.

"I was wearing this amazing vintage dress," she told People magazine. "I made my stylist dress up in it before I went just for fun."

The 39-year-old was wearing a Dior Haute Couture gown to the ceremony for her nomination and eventual win for her role in "The Dropout."

She continued, "It was kind of sewn together, and it started truly falling apart, literally falling off of me on the red carpet, and I think there were even interviews where I'm saying it's breaking off."

Inside during the ceremony, Seyfried said she was chatting with "Top: Gun Maverick" and "Twisters" star Powell when disaster struck.

"I was talking to Glen Powell in the corner near my table, and we were joking around about something and I lifted my arms up, and my boobs were just out. My dress fell apart," Seyfried said.

"We both screamed, and like the gentleman he is, he covered me. He didn't look… I think. None of us were expecting that, but that dress had truly just given up."

Joe Rogan has faced some tough competition in the podcast world.

The comedian began hosting The Joe Rogan Experience podcast in 2009, and he has had a wide array of guests on the show, from political figures like Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders to actors like Jamie Foxx and entrepreneurs like billionaire Elon Musk.

The podcast was on Apple until 2020 when it became a Spotify exclusive show. However, in 2024, the deal with Spotify ended, putting it back on the Apple charts. The show has become a top charting podcast, often sitting at the #1 spot, but it has been dethroned a few times on different charts.

Read about the top podcasts that have taken the #1 spot from Rogan.

Newsweek reported in February 2025 that The MeidasTouch podcast took the No. 1 spot away from Rogan, according to Podscribe data.

The political podcast is hosted by three brothers, Ben, Brett, and Jordy Meiselas.

A post shared by MeidasTouch (@meidastouch)

Per their podcast description, the show "combines brotherly love, comedy, news coverage, and deep discussions about supporting our democracy and is the go-to destination for top political leaders who view the podcast as a pivotal stop for their interviews."

In December 2024, Kylie Kelce, the wife of retired Philadelphia Eagles player Jason Kelce, launched her podcast, Not Gonna Lie with Kylie Kelce. The show quickly rose to the No. 1 spot that month.

A post shared by Not Gonna Lie with Kylie Kelce (@nglwithkylie)

Kylie speaks on a variety of topics in the entertainment/pop culture space, as well as sports and family life in her episodes.

Kylie spoke to New York Times in December 2024 and stated, "I couldn't care less about the charts." She admitted that the haters who were mad about her clinching the top spot are part of what drives her.

Meghan Markle's Archetypes podcast premiered in 2022 as a Spotify exclusive, and it debuted at No. 1 on the charts, knocking down Rogan.

According to the Spotify description, the show is "a podcast where we investigate, dissect, and subvert the labels that try to hold women back."

Despite its success, only 12 episodes were released.

Tori Spelling hates water. 

The Beverly Hills, 90210 alum opened up about her aversion to liquid on the latest episode of iHeartRadio podcast misSpelling, revealing that she's confused about how she's "able to live her life in a state of dehydration."

The reality star's water-repellent ways also contribute to her fear of other liquids, as she believes that every open drink handed to her is poisoned, even if it's made by someone in her circle. Spelling traces this very real fear back to her childhood. The star's mother once crushed a baby aspirin and gave it to her in a spoonful of Coca-Cola, and that's what started it all. 

"So this goes back to childhood. This is crazy. This irrational fear of handed-over liquids from other people. But it ties into my fear of water because I don't drink water. I don't call it a fear of water. I just call it — I like to say, you know, I hate water."

Spelling has been to the hospital a few times because of dehydration caused by her repulsion of water.

Nicolas Cage's ex, the mother of their 34-year-old son, has dismissed her claims against the "National Treasure" actor related to a lawsuit accusing their son of assault, according to court documents.

Christina Fulton, who dated Cage from 1988 until 1991, sued both their son, Weston Coppola Cage, and the 61-year-old actor last month, alleging Cage ignored their son's mental health issues and that he "enabled" his behavior.

"Weston has a long history of mental and psychological disorder and a history of committing violent assault and battery and harming numerous individuals," the lawsuit stated. "Nicolas has been aware of Weston's history and nevertheless failed to take action to prevent Weston from committing acts of violence and harming others."

The dismissal was granted on Tuesday with prejudice, according to Entertainment Weekly.

"The allegations by Christina Fulton against Nicolas Cage are absurd and frivolous," Cage's lawyers told Fox News Digital in February. "Weston Coppola is a 34-year-old man."

"Mr. Cage does not control Weston's behavior in any manner and is not responsible for Weston's alleged assault of his mother," the statement continued.

Meanwhile, an attorney for Weston argued, "the incident with his mother was caused by her – not his father."

"Weston's father, Nicolas Cage, had absolutely nothing to do with Weston's emotional state or condition leading up to the incident with his mother, Christina Fulton," a rep for Weston told Fox News Digital. "At Christina's urging and direction, he agreed to see a new doctor selected by her, who promptly changed his medication and treatment."

Weston's attorney added, "Unfortunately, that resulted in the emotional/medical breakdown resulting in the incident with his mother. Christina's efforts to now blame his father for that incident are absolutely wrong and nothing more than an attempt to generate media attention and force him to pay her money."

Weston and Fulton allegedly got into an argument that turned physical at her Los Angeles home in April 2024, and he was arrested in July on a felony charge of assault with a deadly weapon after he turned himself in on a warrant.

Fox News Digital confirmed from a Los Angeles Police Department spokesperson that Weston walked into the 77th precinct during the early hours of July 10. He was released on bond at the time.

On July 11, Fulton claimed she was "brutally assaulted" by Weston and said that "it is imperative" that her son "receives the help he desperately needs."

Fulton claimed that Cage had enabled their son by bailing him out of jail several times and drinking with him.

The request to dismiss the claims against Cage, which was filed on March 7, says it relates only to Cage "and as to no other defendant," the Los Angeles Times reported.

Fox News Digital has reached out to reps for Cage and Fulton for comment.

The Champions Trophy may have ended, but it is still the talk of the town. Players who performed well are discussed on and off social media. After India's victory, there is also a lot of talk about Varun Chakaravarthy, who emerged as the star of the Champions Trophy. Varun took the most wickets for India and was called Rohit Sharma's trump card. On the strength of his leg spin bowling, he helped India move towards victory. His exceptional bowling skills in the Champions Trophy 2025 have played an important role in India's success, earning him recognition as a key player in the team. By the way, do you know that Varun was an actor before joining the Indian team?

Before gaining fame as a cricketer, Varun Chakaravarthy had a great career in the entertainment industry. In the year 2014, he appeared in the Tamil film 'Jeeva', a sports drama. The film was based on his own life story. He also participated in a popular cooking reality show, in which he showcased his versatility and attracted a wide audience.

Varun played a small role in the 2014 Tamil film 'Jeeva', starring Vishnu Vishal in the lead role. At that time, Varun knew that he was playing a small role in a film that almost resembles his life story. The film revolves around a talented cricketer who struggles to keep his dream alive while fighting the system with his modest means. The protagonist is seen as a different person, a lost face at a local club, but his appearance changes in the dressing room. Even as he climbs the ladder, the tag of being different hangs over him, which almost forces him to quit cricket until a phone call from an IPL scout changes his life forever. The film ends with 'Jeeva' playing for India.

About Varun Chakaravarthy's last game

Varun Chakravarthy's brilliant performance against New Zealand in the group stage was a game-changer, taking five wickets for 42 runs and paving the way for India's 44-run victory. This impressive feat not only highlighted his skills as a 'mystery spinner' but also demonstrated the depth and strength of India's spin attack. With his brilliant performance, he seems to have cemented his place in the ODI team.

Actor Scarlett Johansson, in a new interview, has opened up about that raunchy Saturday Night Live moment when her husband, Colin Jost, made a joke on her vagina. She said that it left her shocked. (Also read: Jurassic World Rebirth trailer: Scarlett Johansson anchors a new era of survival with jaw-dropping new dinosaurs. Watch)

During the interaction with In Style, Scarlett recalled the joke and said, "It was so vulgar, I just can't believe that they went there. I was like—it was so gross. It was really gross. And, like, old-school gross.”

She went on to add, “My experience of it was so funny. I was like, I mean, it's a vagina joke, how bad could it be? And then as soon as the Costco photo came up, I was like No! No, Michael! The fact that it took on a full To Catch a Predator-style reveal or whatever, that was so intense. All of a sudden, it was like a whole bunch of people holding up lights, and a guy with a video camera. They were waiting for me to react. I felt insane. I was like, I think I'm going to faint.”

During the live episode, where Michael Che and Colin Jost's jokes were swapped during the Weekend update, Colin said, “Costco has removed the roast beef sandwich from their menu. But I ain't tripping. I've been eating roast beef every night since my wife had the kid.” Scarlett, who stood backstage, was seen shocked at the joke. She mouthed “Oh my God” in the live reaction.

Scarlett Johansson and Colin Jost married in 2020 in an intimate ceremony with family and friends after dating for three years. They welcomed their first child together, a boy whom they named Cosmo, in 2021.

Holi festival has been depicted in several Hindi films. Several actors from Amitabh Bachchan to Shah Rukh Khan, have given memorable Holi songs and scenes. But amongst them are few movies where Holi sequences played an important role in taking the story forward. Learn about some such Hindi films here.

Raanjhanaa

When Holi is shown in the film 'Raanjhanaa', Sonam Kapoor's character Zoya applies color to actor Dhanush's character, Kundan. This is the moment when Kundan gets completely immersed in Zoya's love. He becomes a part of a different world of love.

Mohabbatein

The story of Shah Rukh Khan and Amitabh's film 'Mohabbatein' shows a fight between discipline and love. Amitabh plays the role of a strict principal in it. SRK plays a music teacher in the film who explains the meaning of love to the children. Despite the strictness of Big B's character, who plays the principal in the film, some children go out and celebrate Holi with Shah Rukh. This challenges the discipline of the principal in the story.

Darr

SRK played a negative role in the film 'Darr', who secretly scares and harasses Kiran (Juhi Chawla). But in the Holi scene, Shah Rukh's character, Rahul, takes advantage of the Holi atmosphere and applies color to Kiran. In this scene, Kiran's lover and future husband, Sunil, chases Rahul but is unable to catch him.

Silsila

In the film 'Silsila', an entire song 'Rang Barse' has been filmed on Holi. But in this song, Amit's wife (Jaya Bachchan) and Chandni's husband (Sanjeev Kumar) come to know about the affair between Amit (Amitabh Bachchan) and Chandni (Rekha). The story of the film takes a different turn because of this Holi scene.

Sholay

In the film 'Sholay', Gabbar and Jai-Veeru come face to face only after the Holi song. Gabbar shows his strength and his fear to the villagers. But Jai and Veeru confront Gabbar and his goons and force them to run away. But after this, Gabbar decides to kill Jai and Veeru.

Bravo stars Dorit Kemsley and Tracy Tutor are exchanging a war of words.

Million Dollar Listing Los Angeles star Tutor, 49, accused Kemsley, 48, of not paying her glam squad and stalking her Instagram during a Tuesday, March 11, interview on SiriusXM's Jeff Lewis Live. Later, Kemsley clapped back during her own interview on Bravo's Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen.

Tutor spoke about celebrity hairstylist Chris Dylan during her interview with Jeff Lewis, noting that he does Kathy Hilton's hair for The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. “He used to do Dorit, but that's over. Because she doesn't pay her bills,” she claimed.

“Based on my knowledge, there's several people that haven't been paid by her, including my stylist, who I think she just tallied up with finally, [and] my makeup artist,” Tutor further claimed. “She's got my people, yet she likes to throw shade and call me a ‘tacky woman.'”



“She likes to apparently stalk my Instagram and the people that I use [for glam],” Tutor added.

RHOBH veteran Kemsley was later asked about Tutor's comments Tuesday night on Watch What Happens Live.

“It's hysterical. That's the funniest thing I've ever heard, like wholeheartedly. There was a lot of s— that she said that, I don't know, it came out of left field,” Kemsley said.



According to Kemsley, “In particular, her talking about Chris Dylan, a hairstylist that I worked with this year for the first time in eight years. … He sent an invoice overcharging me and charging me for a hotel that he'd already used my card to pay for.”

“I think he was just trying to bully this invoice through, not realizing that it goes through a process and my office flagged it,” Kemsley claimed. “When they had written back, ‘This has already been paid,' it was like, ‘Oh s—, I didn't get away with that?' Obviously, he needed to resend an invoice.”

Us Weekly has reached out to Dylan for comment.

As for Tutor, Kemsley said, “Her going on [Jeff Lewis Live] and talking about something she knows nothing about, it seems more like attention-seeking than anything.”

The drama between the two Bravo stars spilled over onto social media. After Lewis posted a clip of Tutor's appearance on his radio show via his Instagram Tuesday, Dylan commented on the post, “After months of begging finally paid in full thank you guys 👏😍 @tracytutor @jljefflewis.”

“@chrisdylanx sometimes you gotta blow the bridge baby. Well done ❤️,” Tutor responded.

In the comments section, Tutor further alleged that Kemsley had “talked s— about me to my team.” (Kemsley did not directly address this claim during her WWHL appearance or via social media.)

Tutor also weighed in under an Instagram post sharing a clip of Kemsley's comments on WWHL. “Guess who got his wire transfer today though 😎,” the reality star wrote under the official WWHL account's post.

The Traitors season 3 winner Gabby Windey is still waiting for her prize money!

The former Bachelorette jointly won the latest season of Peacock's hit game show alongside Dylan Efron, Dolores Catania and Lord Ivar Mountbatten. However, she joked that she still hasn't “seen a dime” of the over $50,000 she earned during the Thursday, March 6, finale.



Appearing on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen on Tuesday, March 11, Gabby, 34, was asked to name her rose and thorn — her favorite and least favorite memories — of filming the reality show last summer in Scotland.

For her rose, Gabby said, “Winning, 100%. Yeah, obviously.”



A post shared by Watch What Happens Live! (@bravowwhl)



She went on to quip, “Still haven't seen a dime — everybody knows here at Bravo, NBC, Peacock.”

As for her thorn? “Not receiving my money. I'm still waiting on my money,” Gabby quipped to chuckles from host Andy Cohen, who assured her she would get it.

Gabby, Dolores, 53, Dylan, 33, and Ivar, 62, all proved they were Faithfuls in the final banishment of season 3, thus splitting a prize fund of $204,300.

“We did it! Despite all the odds, we are the most Faithfuls to ever win and honestly it feels so good,” Gabby said after the final banishment. “But life has taught me that doing the hard thing and doing the right thing are often the same. But you will get an even greater reward.”

Dylan reflected on the moment as well, saying, ”We went against some of the best gamers in the world and we won this game. It is hard to believe. That is the underdog story right there.”

On Tuesday's WWHL, Dylan also shared his highlight — and lowlight — from filming Traitors.

“My rose was honestly getting to play with 20 people that I looked up to and watched on TV. That was the best part about it,” Dylan shared, noting that his thorn was the catering provided to the cast. (Mexican day, in particular, was “bad,” he said.)

As well as celebrating her Traitors victory, Gabby also revealed last week that she tied the knot with writer and comedian Robby Hoffman.

The couple broke news of their secret Las Vegas wedding in an interview with Cosmopolitan published on Wednesday, March 5. “We had just evacuated from the [Los Angeles] fires. Literally cue Rihanna, ‘We found love in a hopeless place,'” Gabby told the outlet. “What better time to get married than right now? Because if the world is ending, we want to be with each other.”

Gabby revealed it was her idea to get married, sharing, “Robby was literally ready to propose three weeks in and I'm always the one pumping the breaks, but when something feels right, it just feels right. I think it was better for the both of us that it was my idea.”

Meghan Markle is determined to sprinkle some "Markle Sparkle" over fans, but several royal experts claim that the dark cloud of bullying allegations continues to loom over her.

Several crew members from the Duchess of Sussex's Netflix series, "With Love, Meghan," came forward to People magazine. They gushed over working with the "friendly" and "approachable" royal, who created a "chill" environment and gifted pans with a "personally monogrammed spoon with her handwriting that says, ‘Thank You, Crew.'"

The report was published after the eight-episode series was mercilessly torn apart by royal watchers and less-than-impressed viewers on social media for appearing inauthentic. The show was also hit with poor reviews both in the U.S. and U.K.

Meghan Markle Is No Match For Martha Stewart Or Rachael Ray: Experts

British broadcaster and photographer Helena Chard questioned the People magazine feature, noting that for years the mother of two had been accused of bullying. She pointed out that as recently as September 2024, an unnamed source described the 43-year-old to The Hollywood Reporter as a "dictator in high heels" who has "reduced grown men to tears."

Fox News Digital reached out to a spokesperson for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex for comment when The Hollywood Reporter's story was published.

"Meghan is desperate to receive accolades and public approval," Chard claimed. "She longs to be perceived as the best thing since sliced bread. Her aim, with the help of certain publications, is to revamp her character and change the public's perception. Let's face it, she, along with Netflix, needs bums on seats and future bustling sales."

"The public has a long memory of Meghan's behavior, the hurt and upset caused to the royal family," said Chard. "Meghan hasn't redeemed herself… If anything, she has shown a passive-aggressive side to the public as she clings to her royal title."

Meghan, a former American actress, married Britain's Prince Harry in 2018. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex stepped back as senior royals in 2020 and moved to California. They cited the unbearable intrusions and racist attitudes of the British media for their royal exit.

But in 2021, days before Meghan and Harry's televised interview with Oprah Winfrey aired, Valentine Low broke the story of bullying allegations. The claims were made by former palace aides who worked with the Duchess of Sussex at Kensington Palace before her royal exit. Meghan's team strongly refuted the claims.

Low later told Fox News Digital that some former staff still had difficulty discussing their experiences. Some even referred to themselves as members of the "The Sussex Survivors' Club."

In June 2023, Buckingham Palace announced it had investigated how the staff had handled allegations of bullying made against Meghan.

According to palace officials, the details of the independent review were not being released to protect the confidentiality of those who took part. Following the review, officials said the palace's human resources policy had been updated, but the palace declined to say what the changes were.

Following The Hollywood Reporter's story, several former and current staff members came forward to Us Weekly. They defended the couple and their work ethic.

In February 2025, Vanity Fair published a cover story about the couple's lives in California. Several of those who worked with Meghan described how, at first, she would be "warm and effusive," creating an atmosphere of "professional camaraderie." However, whenever something went poorly, "often due to Meghan and Harry's own demands," she would become "cold and withholding towards the person she perceived to be responsible."

Then in March, shortly before the premiere of "With Love, Meghan," Jason Knauf, the former palace aide who accused Meghan of bullying, gave a rare interview with "60 Minutes Australia." When asked if it was tough to find himself in the spotlight after the allegations of bullying went public, Knauf said he had "no regrets" and "wouldn't change anything."

"The exclusive [People magazine] article highlighting Meghan Markle's impeccable behavior towards the crew is opportunely placed," Chard claimed.

"You'd almost think Meghan had written the article herself! [But] I completely believe Meghan forged above and beyond to cater to the crew, needing to quash previous bullying allegations. [I believe] she was intent on using every trick in the book to ensure her sweetly inauthentic domestic goddess charms look second nature."

"I would like to believe her actions come from a heart-centered place, similar to her late mother-in-law," Chard shared. "[But] Meghan's sugar-coated [version of herself] just doesn't wash… Authenticity is her biggest challenge."

Royal expert Hilary Fordwich said she needs more convincing to believe that Meghan's sweet-as-jam persona is the real deal.

"One would hope she listened to and cared about how horrifically bad all her previous staff have felt," said Fordwich. "Perhaps she is bending over backwards to make amends for all those past grievances of her numerous staff members who have quit and reported exactly the opposite. Numbers, unfortunately for Meghan Markle, don't lie. There are too many members of the ‘Sussex Survivors' Club.'"

"… One can guess who contacted People," Fordwich added.

Kinsey Schofield, host of the To Di For Daily podcast, pointed out to Fox News Digital that "With Love, Meghan" was originally given the green light for two seasons, regardless of its success.

"Sources have said that Meghan's ‘Season 2' announcement on social media was an effort by Meghan and Netflix to distract from the flood of negative feedback, but Netflix executives are ‘worried' about the reception," Schofield claimed.

"It's no coincidence that these glowing… stories are appearing in People magazine, which Meghan just gave an exclusive… [But] Meghan only engaging with media entities that refuse to challenge her is not sustainable. If she wants to change public perception, she needs to answer some tough questions."

"She can feed People magazine all the glowing testimonials she wants, but if only one outlet that has a relationship with you is reporting you're a saint… you both lose all credibility," she added.

Schofield noted the Season 2 announcement also "gives the appearance of a professional win – which she so desperately needed."

Fox News Digital reached out to Netflix for comment.

Products from Meghan's lifestyle brand, As Ever, are expected to be available for purchase this season. New episodes of "With Love, Meghan" will become available for streaming in the fall.

But despite Meghan's attempts to carve out a new role in Hollywood, that of influencer, royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams said she has a long way to go before past bullying allegations fade away for good.

"The reviews of ‘With Love, Meghan' were truly, madly, deeply awful," said Fitzwilliams. "However, it did climb to the Netflix Top 10, which will please her… [But] sycophantic guests watching Meghan cooking in a neighbor's house in the Montecito sunshine won't erase [bullying allegations]. No one has forgotten how [the Duke and Duchess of Sussex] ruthlessly monetized their royal connections and the depth of the rift in the royal family."

"The revival of allegations of bad behavior, which Meghan strongly denies… has already harmed her image enormously," Fitzwilliams shared. "Who knows what's to come?"

This film is the official Hindi remake of the Hollywood film of the same name. The remake of the film 'The Intern' starring Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro was first to be made with Rishi Kapoor, then after his death, Bollywood Megastar Amitabh Bachchan was roped in. 

Director Amit Ravindranath Sharma was signed for the Hindi remake of the film, but now he is no longer its director. Denzil Dias, VP and MD of Warner Bros Pictures India, said that the company is continuously working on the director and other issues of the film and his company is constantly in touch with Deepika regarding this film and is trying to start it as soon as possible. Sources close to Deepika say that she has gone to Paris with the Hindi script of the film 'The Intern' and it is very much expected that she will make her decision public soon.

Zeeko Zaki is just like Us and enjoys seeing OA, Maggie and Scola work as a trio on FBI — but he teased that their smaller team won't last much longer.

After special agent Stuart Scola's (John Boyd) partner Tiffany “Tiff” Wallace (Katherine Renee Kane) exited the series at the start of season 7, Scola hasn't found a new forever partner. Instead, he's worked alongside partners Maggie Bell (Missy Peregrym) and Omar Adom “OA” Zidan (Zaki) on and off.



“It's [the] Three Musketeers for a minute,” Zaki, 35, exclusively told Us Weekly about the team dynamics the remainder of the season. “But we do introduce a fourth agent.”

The actor played coy about whether this new addition will stick. “Hopefully, it all works out and we'll see if it's for the long run,” Zaki continued, noting, “We do introduce a fourth agent in the next few episodes and it's exciting.”

Earlier this season, Scola was briefly paired with Sydney Ortiz (Lisette Olivera). However, she left for a different gig with the bureau after episode 8.

Since then, Scola has teamed up with both Maggie and OA together as well as partnering with them one-on-one. That dynamic is something Zaki told Us will continue before the new agent joins the force.

“What's kind of exciting [with] the next few episodes [is] the ones that we all have off sort of line up,” Zaki shared. “You're going to see a lot more of one of us not being there and things like that.”

Even with the mixing of partners, Zaki said it will be seamless on the job. “We've all been working together now for six years. [OA] and Maggie seven, but Scola came in season 2, so the dynamic between the three of us is always really great,” he explained.

The personal shakeup, however, does mean that Maggie and OA, who have worked together since season 1 of the series, have been apart for a significant amount of time.

“It tees us up for a great kind of reunion moment for Maggie and OA when we get back together on screen,” Zaki teased. “It's a fun new sort of thing to play.”

No matter what the pairing, Zaki promised a lot of high intensity cases to wrap up the remainder of the season. (During the Tuesday, March 11, episode, OA took down a group of train hijackers solo while trying to protect his girlfriend, Gemma, who was accidentally shot in the attack.)

“We face some eco terrorists, we face some cartel, we get some more traditional cases here and there,” he told Us, adding, “The stakes keep rising and somehow we keep finding a way to do these really exciting episodes.”

Zaki noted that FBI's final two episodes have yet to film, so he's not sure what the finale will entail. However, based on past patterns, he is hopeful OA will be front and center for them both.

“Usually, OA gets a heavy one in the last few [episodes]. So we'll see if there's one more in the bucket for him,” he shared.

What Zaki does know is that the team will be “trying to find our new balance with four agents at the end of the season.”

FBI airs on CBS Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET.
