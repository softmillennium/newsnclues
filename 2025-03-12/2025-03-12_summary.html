ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — A battle between separatist militants and Pakistani soldiers over a hijacked passenger train entered its second day on Wednesday, with dozens of people killed in clashes and an unknown number of passengers still believed to be held hostage by the militants. In a statement Wednesday, the group threatened that “with every passing hour after the ultimatum expires, five hostages will be punished” — a phrase widely understood to mean they would be executed. The deepwater Gwadar port in southern Baluchistan is a key component of that plan. Militant attacks in that part of Pakistan surged by more than 80 percent last year, killing more than 320 people, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies. Officials documented at least 15 attacks against non-Baluch workers, travelers or settlers last year.</p>

Even as calls grew to investigate accusations of systematic, state-sanctioned killings by police, Duterte remained popular. A national survey in 2019 found that around 80 percent of Filipinos polled were “satisfied” with the administration's campaign. The Philippine government in June 2022 reported that at least 6,252 people had died “during antidrug operations” since July 2016. He was expected to meet with then-President Barack Obama, who called the meeting off after Duterte in that briefing used a Tagalog expression literally meaning “son of a whore” in threatening to curse Obama if he raised the subject of extrajudicial killings. The ICC began investigating Duterte in 2018, and three years later it formally authorized an investigation on accusations of extrajudicial killings amounting to a crime against humanity.</p>

“With President Trump's rollbacks of restrictions, there will be new opportunities for US investors to engage with Africa's oil and gas sector,” said Robert Stryk, chair of Stryk Global Diplomacy, a consultancy helping the African Energy Chamber facilitate US-funded oil and gas projects in Africa. Stryk said it was “hypocritical” for western countries to demand Africa forgo fossil fuels after powering their own economies on coal, oil and gas. “Japan will soon begin importing historic new shipments of clean American liquefied natural gas (LNG) in record numbers,” the president said last month. “I invited the Japanese government to come look at Freeport and see what 57 years of industrial build-out … has done for this city,” he said. “Trump's neocolonial mineral grab would make Ukraine a vassal state and accelerate the climate crisis while doing nothing to protect our sovereignty,” Romanko added.</p>

“I know this news is difficult and may affect us all differently,” admitted acting administrator Janet Petro in an all-staff e-mail. In his first cabinet meeting on 26 February, Trump suggested that officials “use scalpels” when trimming their departments' spending and personnel – rather than Musk's figurative chainsaw. Meanwhile, in a speech to African energy ministers in Washington on 7 March, US energy secretary Chris Wright claimed that coal has “transformed our world and made it better”, adding that climate change, while real, is not on his list of the world's top 10 problems. Universities have also started to rein in spending with Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for example, implementing a hiring freeze. Entitled Unleashing American Potential, it calls for increased public and private investment in science to maintain US leadership.</p>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/12/prince-andrew-was-told-epstein-saw-staley-as-close-friend-court-hears'>Ex-Barclays boss Jes Staley admits having sex with member of Jeffrey Epstein staff</a></h2><b>Source:</b> The Guardian&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-12 18:04:00 <p>
The former chief executive of Barclays, Jes Staley, has admitted to having sex with a member of Jeffery Epstein's staff in an apartment owned by the child sex offender's brother in New York, a court has heard. The FCA's lawyer Leigh-Ann Mulcahy KC handed documents to Staley and tribunal judges without presenting them to the public, before asking Staley: “Do you accept that you had sexual intercourse with a woman at Mr Epstein's brother's apartment?” One message, sent by Epstein to Prince Andrew in May 2010, said: “I know you are seeing Jes Staley this morning, he is like family and can be trusted 100%.” Andrew has faced fierce criticism over his ties to Epstein, who died in August 2019 while awaiting trial over charges on trafficking underage girls for sex. However, Staley denied this, saying that he believed Epstein “would willingly mislead and lie about our relationship”. Staley appeared angry and agitated as attention turned to Epstein's relationship with Staley's daughter, particularly after the FCA showed emails suggesting the financier had been “pulling strings” to support her through her academic career and PhD.</p>

Supporters of Duterte criticized the administration of current Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, Duterte's political rival, for arresting and surrendering the former leader to a court whose jurisdiction his supporters dispute. An ambulance drove to the hangar where his plane was taken, and medics wheeled a gurney inside. If his case goes to trial and he is convicted, Duterte could face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Duterte's supporters, however, criticized his arrest as illegal and sought to have him returned home. ICC judges who looked at prosecution evidence supporting their request for his arrest found “reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. Duterte is individually responsible for the crime against humanity of murder” as an “indirect co-perpetrator for having allegedly overseen the killings when he was mayor of Davao and later president of the Philippines,” according to his warrant.</p>

There has been growing ethical debate in recent years over the display of Egyptian pharaoh's mummies, with many in the museum sector now referring to them as mummified persons as a mark of respect, although they remain popular attractions.

US President Donald Trump said Wednesday that negotiators were headed to Russia "right now" for talks on a possible ceasefire with Ukraine, after Kyiv agreed to a 30-day truce. "And if we do, I think that would be 80 percent of the way to getting this horrible bloodbath finished." Trump would not say when he would next speak to his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, but added that "I hope he's going to have a ceasefire" and that there had been "positive messages" from Moscow. "I can do things financially that would be very bad for Russia. (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</p>

Canadian government says it will follow ‘dollar-by-dollar' approach and institute 25% tariffs on US imports The tariffs going into effect has started a chain reaction of retaliatory tariffs as countries around the world decide how to respond to Trump's policy. Canada's announcement comes after the EU announced its own tariffs on American imports, including products such as motorcycles and whiskey, totaling $28bn. Canadian and EU leaders voiced regret over the impact the tariffs will have on domestic businesses, but argued countries need to respond appropriately to Trump's actions “The only constant in this unjustified and unjustifiable trade war seems to be President Trump's talks of annexing our country's through economic coercion,” Joly told a press conference.</p>

President Vladimir Putin has consistently stated that a temporary ceasefire would be unacceptable to Moscow. In a joint statement, the United States and Kyiv vowed to “immediately begin negotiations toward an enduring peace that provides for Ukraine's long-term security.” Putin ruled out a truce or temporary ceasefire in July, while insisting that “Russia stands for a complete and final end to the conflict,” which according to his conditions for peace would involve Ukraine's demilitarization, neutrality and surrender of large chunks of territory. Russian far-right ideologue Alexander Dugin, whose revanchist ideas are believed to influence Putin, said that Moscow would certainly reject the ceasefire proposal. This is not boasting, but an understanding that real agreements are still being written there, at the front.</p>

The Russian president remains unwavering in his demands, making wider sanctions and tariffs ineffective For its part, Moscow has said it needs to be briefed by Washington before replying, with the Kremlin press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, cautioning media against “getting ahead” of themselves, while suggesting Putin and Trump could speak in person. “It is difficult for Putin to agree to this in its current form,” a senior Kremlin source told Reuters, adding: “Putin has a strong position because Russia is advancing. “So yes, we are in favour of a truce with both hands, but we need at least framework guarantees and at least from the United States,” the source said.

An injured passenger rescued by security forces from a passenger train attacked by insurgents arrives at a railway station in Much near Quetta, Pakistan's southwestern Balochistan province, Wednesday, March 12, 2025. It has also staged attacks beyond Balochistan, including in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city. Although the government insists it has significantly curbed violence, attacks in Balochistan have not abated. The two countries share a 900-kilometer (560-mile) border, which remains largely ungoverned, allowing smugglers and militant groups to move about freely. “Who will come and invest in Pakistan if we keep seeing such attacks,” he said.</p>

Under Donald Trump, Republicans have made attacks on transgender rights a central part of their party platform, especially targeting healthcare for trans youth, transgender troops and official recognition of gender, with the US president declaring during his inauguration speech that his government would only recognise two genders, male and female, following it up with an executive order. McBride has been repeatedly misgendered on the House floor by Republicans and even targeted with a bill, introduced by Nancy Mace of South Carolina, to ban transgender women from using women's bathrooms on Capitol Hill. “I was disappointed that the chair decided to end a committee hearing early,” she said. “Because every single time we hear the incoming administration or Republicans in Congress talk about any vulnerable group in this country, we have to be clear that it is an attempt to distract. “Every single time we hear them say the word ‘trans', look at what they're doing with their right hand.</p>

SEOUL — Washington's closest security allies in the Asia-Pacific region are still holding out hope for exemptions to President Donald Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which went into effect Wednesday. During his address to Congress last week, Trump claimed that Seoul levies tariffs four times higher than those of the United States. But the nation's deep political crisis is hampering its ability to make a strong case, analysts say. Top Japanese officials, including Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, immediately rejected Trump's characterizations that Washington unilaterally protects Japan. Just last month, Canberra made its first $500 million payment to Washington under the AUKUS nuclear submarine deal.</p>

Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly ruled out a temporary break in hostilities, saying it would only benefit Ukraine and its Western allies by letting them replenish their arsenals. On top of that, he now wants Kyiv to withdraw its forces from the four regions Moscow has seized but doesn't fully control. U.S. President Donald Trump has spoken of the need for Ukraine to hold an election in comments that echoed Moscow's view.

According to the Danish daily Berlingske, Nielsen and Denmark's Liberal Alliance inked a political cooperation agreement in January. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Mute Egede, who belongs to Inuit Ataqatigiit party, said in a Facebook post: “We respect the election outcome,” adding that he would consider any suggestions made during future coalition negotiations. Taking to X, American political blogger Seth Abramson wrote: “Trump and Musk lost the election in Greenland as hard as you can lose an election in a country you have virtually nothing to do with and never will.”</p>

Break in talks comes as Trump escalates trade war with Canada and threatens its sovereignty The United States has paused negotiations with Canada on a key water-sharing treaty as Donald Trump continues both his threats to annex his northern neighbour and to upend major agreements governing relations between the two counties. The treaty first came into effect in 1964, after devastating floods nearly two decades before that destroyed Oregon's second-largest city and swaths of southern British Columbia. In recent weeks, Trump has taken an increasingly combative stance towards Canada, calling its border “imaginary”, musing about inflicting “historic financial devastation” on a longtime ally and threatening to tear up the myriad treaties between the two countries. He pledged that “we're going to fight … everywhere, including in these negotiations” amid hostility from the White House.</p>

But Duterte arguably would not have been surrendered to The Hague if it weren't for his family's dramatic feud with that of Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the current president. His government has continued to maintain that it would not assist the court, of which the Philippines is no longer a member, but explained that it would cooperate with any arrest warrant issued via Interpol. Shortly after the plane carrying Duterte took off on Tuesday night, Marcos Jr told reporters: “The arrest that we did today was in compliance with our commitments to Interpol. According to Tony La Viña, a lawyer and former dean of the Ateneo de Manila University school of government, the arrest was a “perfect execution” by Marcos Jr's administration. Rodrigo Duterte's supporters have portrayed him as a victim who was denied due process by the vengeful Marcos family, and who has been wrongly handed over to foreigners.</p>

When asked en route by reporters about Trump's repeated comments on making Canada the 51st US state, Rubio said Washington was working on a number of issues, including defence and Ukraine. “It is not a meeting about how we're going to take over Canada.” Rubio says he wants the G7 to be “constructive” but Trump's unpredictable foreign policy has left Washington's longtime allies scrambling. Rubio will be arriving in a country that has united around opposition to Trump and his hyper-nationalist US ideology. “The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished Fifty First State,” he wrote online.</p>

U.S. Secretary of State, Marco Rubio said Russia would be presented with a ceasefire proposal, after the Trump administration lifted its suspension of military aid and intelligence sharing for Ukraine, and Kyiv signaled that it was open to the 30-day ceasefire. “And if we do, I think that would be 80% of the way to getting this horrible bloodbath” ended. The U.S. hopes to see Russia stop attacks on Ukraine within the next few days as a first step, Rubio said at a refueling stop Wednesday in Shannon, Ireland, on his way to talks in Canada with other Group of Seven leading industrialized nations. The fighting has escalated as ceasefire talks come to a head, with Moscow intent on taking back its territory and Kyiv determined to hold onto it as a bargaining chip in any negotiations. Recent fighting reportedly has focused on the Kursk town of Sudzha, which is a key Ukrainian supply hub and operational base.</p>

She said she would raise the matter with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the Group of Seven foreign ministers meeting, which Canada is hosting. Earlier this month, the Canadian government imposed tariffs on C$30 billion of US products in response to Donald Trump's move to place 25% tariffs on many Canadian goods. "We will not stand idly by while our iconic steel and aluminium industries are being unfairly targeted," he told reporters, according to AFP. “I have instructed my Secretary of Commerce to add an ADDITIONAL 25% Tariff, to 50%, on all STEEL and ALUMINUM COMING INTO THE UNITED STATES FROM CANADA, ONE OF THE HIGHEST TARIFFING NATIONS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.</p>

A single Chinese state-owned shipbuilder produced more commercial vessels by tonnage in 2024 than the entire U.S. shipbuilding industry has since World War II, according to a report that underscores how China has come to dominate the sector. China has said it would “take necessary measures” to defend itself against any such fees. The state-owned firm is a major defense contractor that supplies the Chinese military but also has commercial operations — just as American companies such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin have both commercial and military divisions. A CSIS analysis last year found that China's navy commanded 234 warships compared with the U.S. naval fleet of 219. “When you are buying a ship from a shipyard in China, you don't know what the profit is on the Chinese side and how those profits might be getting used to augment or subsidize military production.”</p>

Israel blocked all aid into the war-ravaged Gaza Strip earlier this month in an effort to pressure Hamas into agreeing an extension to the existing ceasefire in Gaza rather than moving onto a second stage. However, Hamas said on Tuesday that a new round of ceasefire talks had begun in Qatar.

LONDON (AP) — The captain of a cargo ship that collided with a U.S. tanker is a Russian national who remains in U.K. police custody, the vessel's owner said Wednesday, as it emerged that the ship failed several safety checks last year. U.K. authorities say they have found no evidence of foul play in the crash, and there is nothing so far to indicate that it's connected to national security. Humberside Police said that detectives were conducting inquiries alongside partner agencies. The Solong was drifting and still smoldering Wednesday, but is likely to remain afloat rather than sinking, officials said. “We're not quite out of the danger zone yet, but it's starting to look like an environmental disaster may have been narrowly averted,” said Paul Johnston from the Greenpeace Research Laboratories.</p>

However, Dutch lawmakers have warned that the plan lacks a concrete financial framework and could lead to an economic crisis. Lawmakers argued that the plan's reliance on joint EU loans would increase debt burdens for member states and expose them to financial risks. The EU intensified its plans to militarize after US President Donald Trump repeatedly criticized European NATO members for failing to meet the bloc's defense spending commitments. In response, European leaders have moved to expand their military budgets with some citing a supposed Russian threat as justification for the rush. Moscow has repeatedly rejected having any intentions to attack NATO or EU countries and has dismissed such claims as “nonsense.” The Kremlin has also condemned the EU's plans to increase defense spending, calling it “militarization” that is “primarily aimed at Russia” and stressing that such moves are a “matter of deep concern” for Moscow.</p>

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has given a lengthy interview with three US bloggers who traveled to Moscow. For more than 90 minutes, Lavrov answered questions from Mario Nawfal, the host of one of the most popular interview shows on X, as well as former CIA analyst and co-founder of the Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS) group, Larry Johnson, and former judge Andrew Napolitano, who previously worked for Fox News and wrote for the Washington Post and other outlets. During the interview, Lavrov suggested that “a return to normalcy” has been emerging in the US since the start of Trump's second term at the White House. He also reiterated Russia's readiness to look for a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine conflict, but stressed that officials in Moscow “know what must be done” to reach a settlement and “would compromise the fate of the people,” referring to Russian citizens and ethnic Russians in Ukraine.

The result should send a clear message to Trump that Greenland is not for sale, Demokraatit leader Jens-Friederik Nielsen told Sky News. And we want to build our own country by ourselves, not with his hope,” he said. Greenland was colonized 300 years ago by Denmark, which still exercises control over foreign and defense policy. Second-place finisher Naleraq is the most aggressively pro-independence, while Demokraatit favors a more moderate pace of change. He said that Greenland needs to stand together “in a time of great interest from outside,” KNR TV reported.</p>

Demokraatit — which favors a moderate pace of independence from Denmark, according to the Associated Press — held three of the 31 parliamentary seats before this week's vote. Party leader Jens Frederik Nielsen received more than 4,400 personal votes, the highest number for a single candidate in this election, according to the state broadcaster.

Greenland has long been of strategic importance due to its Arctic location and untapped mineral resources. According to early results, the centrist Demokraatit party, which supports economic expansion and a gradual approach to independence, is leading with 29.9% of the vote, a sharp rise from 9.1% in 2021. The former Danish colony was granted self-rule in 1979, but Copenhagen retains control of foreign affairs, defense, and monetary policy. Denmark currently provides an annual subsidy that accounts for about a quarter of Greenland's economy. Speaking at a recent joint session of Congress, Trump reaffirmed his support for Greenland's right to determine its future, suggesting the territory could break away from Denmark and join the US.</p>

Pakistan's forces on Wednesday refrained from launching frontal attacks inside a train hijacked by the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) militants. Its spokesman Jeeyand Baloch has asked Pakistan to release jailed militants in exchange for the passengers. "Comrades are shedding their blood for you, for this motherland," one of its fighters on the train said in a Telegram message that urged people in mineral-rich Balochistan to join the group's fight against Pakistan's government. A Reuters journalist, meanwhile, saw nearly 100 vacant coffins at Quetta railway station, where more of those aboard the Jaffer Express were expected to arrive. Due to the presence of women and children with suicide bombers, extreme caution is being exercised," security sources told AFP.</p>

In response, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova labeled Kallas's comments as evidence of the “degradation” of senior EU officials, asserting that the senior diplomat has reached a new low in “cynicism and immorality.” “How can one seriously negotiate with people who have declared lies as their official position?” Zakharova questioned.

The interviewers suggested US President Donald Trump's approach  replicates President Richard Nixon's historic 1972 rapprochement with China that ensured a continuation of the Sino-Soviet split.

Moscow cannot yet comment on any ceasefire proposals agreed upon by the US and Ukraine during their latest talks, but is carefully studying the statements that are coming out following Tuesday's negotiations in Saudi Arabia, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. The talks in Jeddah, which are said to have lasted about 9.5 hours, ended with Kiev and Washington issuing a joint statement. At the same time, he noted that such a call could be quickly organized. Previously, Moscow had opposed the idea of a temporary truce in Ukraine and emphasized that a settlement should not serve to provide Kiev with breathing space and an opportunity to rearm itself before resuming hostilities. Russian President Vladimir Putin has insisted that a resolution of the conflict should guarantee long-term peace.</p>

The past year has seen a surge in violence, with attacks increasing by 90% compared to 2023, according to the Islamabad-based Center for Research and Security Studies. The group's membership is estimated to be around 5,000, with a growing number of women, including law students and medicine graduates, participating in its activities. The BLA "has been able to exploit legitimate local grievances", he said.

He added that the Kremlin could organise a call between Putin and Trump at short notice if needed. He said that while monitoring sea and air ceasefires would be easy, he hoped Ukraine's western partners would provide a plan for how to monitor a ceasefire along the frontline, “given who we are dealing with and given our experience of the past years”. Some Russian officials indicated scepticism about the prospect of a ceasefire, saying Moscow was unwilling to stop the fighting as its forces this week made rapid gains in reclaiming territory in Russia's Kursk region, where Ukraine launched a surprise incursion last year.

Josybeth, a 37-year-old Venezuelan woman stranded in northern Mexico, said that now that the legal pathways to enter the U.S. are closed, she'd rather return to Venezuela than stay in Mexico.

FCA and Bank of England's PRA join retreat from efforts to help underrepresented groups, citing ‘regulatory burdens' The City's top two regulators have said they will not bring in new diversity and inclusion rules for financial firms because they want to avoid imposing extra “regulatory burdens” and costs, in the latest sign of a retreat from efforts to help underrepresented groups. “We continue to think that an appropriate focus on diversity and inclusion in the culture of the firms we regulate can deliver improved internal governance, decision-making and risk management,” Woods wrote. However, after consultations with the companies it regulates, and with the Treasury committee, Woods said that financial firms did not want regulators to introduce new rules including gender and ethnicity pay gap reporting, at a time when the government was planning to bring in new legal reporting requirements for companies. Several large US corporations, including Walmart, McDonald's, Ford and Amazon, followed suit in either scrapping or scaling back their DEI schemes, while the Facebook owner, Meta, overhauled its content moderation to remove restrictions on topics such as gender and immigration.</p>

US President Donald Trump's decision to impose tariffs and suggestions that Canada should be annexed have angered Canadians, who are expressing their anger in different ways. New travel bookings to the neighbouring country have declined by 20% since February 1. United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said that the carrier has adjusted its capacity after seeing a big drop in passenger arrivals from Canada. Allyson C, a Vancouver resident who cancelled her family's summer vacation to Washington, said the family has lost a lot of interest in going to the States in general. Arrivals were already at 90% of pre-pandemic levels and a drop further worries the local travel industry.</p>

Putin, by instinct cautious, has preferred watching from the sidelines, suppressing his delight as Trump denounced Volodymyr Zelenskyy to his face in the White House and wreaked subsequent vengeance by stopping all military aid and then pulling some US intelligence. Those that argued that the Kyiv-Washington relationship had to be repaired, even at the cost of concessions by Ukraine, in essence agreed with Trump's warning to Zelenskyy when he said: “You are not in a good position. But it morphed into a crisis strategy meeting to which every self-respecting European leader demanded an invitation. By 6 March, the US was briefing that Zelenskyy would meet US officials in Saudi Arabia to agree to a ceasefire, a clear sign that Washington had been convinced the Ukrainian leader had learned his lesson. Starmer's national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, also tested this proposition in a conversation with Waltz, his US counterpart.</p>

Officials said the man was interviewed several times and gave differing details each time, CNN said, but there were no major inconsistencies and translation issues might have been the reason for any discrepancies. “It's already four days and everybody's so worried,” family friend Shekar Pendem said to CNN.

Greenland has voted for a complete overhaul of its government in a shock result in which the centre-right Democrat party more than tripled its seats after a dramatic election campaign fought against the backdrop of Donald Trump's threats to acquire the Arctic island. Tuesday's election, in which the Democrats replaced Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA), the party of the outgoing prime minister, Múte B Egede, as the biggest party in Inatsisartut, the Greenlandic parliament, also led to a doubling of seats for Naleraq – the party most open to US collaboration and which supports a snap vote on independence – making it the second-biggest party. Both the Democrats and Naleraq favour independence from Denmark, but they differ on the pace of change

“It is worrisome,” said Dr Ron Cook, a family medicine specialist in Lubbock who serves as the county's health authority. He worries that the immunocompromised and babies could be exposed to measles in doctor's waiting rooms. Although measles was once a common childhood disease, it is not without risks and general misery. Additionally, scientists believe that measles infection can make people more vulnerable to secondary infections for months because it suppresses the immune system. Rarer side effects, such as febrile seizure, are nearly 10 times less common than children dying from measles infection, according to studies cited by the CDC.</p>

The company, whose slogan was “make oil history”, received more than $10bn in equity, debt and public financing since it was founded in 2016, and it counted the carmaker Volkswagen and the investment bank Goldman Sachs as its biggest owners. Northvolt was widely regarded as a leading player in European efforts to build an electric vehicle battery industry. The company built a factory in northern Sweden, where it was hoping to use green energy to produce hundreds of thousands of EV batteries each year, but it ran into difficulties getting the facility up and running. It blamed “a series of compounding challenges” in recent months that had hit its finances, “including rising capital costs, geopolitical instability, subsequent supply chain disruptions, and shifts in market demand”. Northvolt added that it had faced “significant internal challenges” during the increase of battery production in what it called a “highly complex industry”.</p>

US President Donald Trump has reversed course on plans to double tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, a senior White House adviser said Tuesday in an interview with CNBC. Ford's move, in turn, was a response to Trump's initial 25% duty on Canadian steel and aluminum. Trump hinted at a possible reversal Tuesday afternoon, and later, White House trade advisor Peter Navarro confirmed the decision on CNBC. They also announced plans to meet in Washington on Thursday to negotiate a renewed trade deal between the US, Canada, and Mexico ahead of Trump's April 2 tariff deadline. Meanwhile, White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement that the initially announced 25% tariff on steel and aluminum “with no exceptions or exemptions” would take effect for Canada and all other trading partners on March 12, pursuant to Trump's previous executive orders.</p>

Russia has “burned [its] fingers” many times dealing with the West, Lavrov said in an interview with podcasters Mario Nawfal, Larry Johnson, and Andrew Napolitano published on Wednesday. The Turkish-mediated draft truce in 2022 would have transformed Ukraine into a neutral state with some territorial concessions. Following talks between Washington and Kiev on Tuesday, US President Donald Trump said Russia's reaction to his proposal of a 30-day ceasefire would inform him on whether Moscow genuinely wants peace. Lavrov, however, noted that Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky had received a hero's welcome in the UK after his clash with Trump at the White House last month. “It's an indication that they want to raise the stakes and they are preparing something to pressure the Donald Trump administration back into some aggressive action against Russia,” Lavrov said.</p>

Starlink had been trying to find a way into the Indian market since October 2022. Jio had advocated for an auction-based approach, while the government preferred to follow global practices and allocate spectrum administratively. Mittal's stance was echoed by Jio, which had also called for satellite firms to be treated on par with telecom companies. Elon Musk responded to Jio's comments, characterising the demand for an auction-based approach as "unprecedented." These developments follow Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the US and his meeting with Elon Musk.</p>

Starlink will also use its partners' network infrastructure to enhance satellite coverage across India, where a vast population still lacks internet access. Jio has long been at odds with Starlink over methods for awarding satellite service spectrum in India. Tesla, Musk's electric car maker, has also faced hurdles in India due to the country's high import duties on vehicles, but it could be getting a boost as well. Cheap satellite broadband is needed to bridge this gap, particularly in India's vast remote and mountainous rural areas.</p>

American and Ukrainian delegations held talks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, during which Kiev agreed to an “immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire” with Russia proposed by Washington and expressed readiness to sign a deal granting the US access to Ukraine's critical resources “as soon as possible.” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, represented Washington during the talks, while the Ukrainian delegation was headed by Zelensky's chief of staff, Andrey Yermak. I know that Secretary of State Rubio and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz are working very hard on this.” Russian President Vladimir Putin said in January that “the goal should not be a short truce, not some kind of respite for regrouping forces and rearmament with the aim of subsequently continuing the conflict, but a long-term peace based on respect for the legitimate interests of all people, all nations living in this region.”</p>

JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia — The Trump administration lifted its pause on military and intelligence support for Ukraine on Tuesday after Kyiv endorsed an ambitious U.S. ceasefire proposal aimed at initiating an end to the three-year war. “It effectively puts the onus on Russia to accept an arrangement they otherwise would have rejected out of hand or risk Trump's ire,” said Sam Charap, a senior political scientist at Rand, a think tank. The Trump administration has ruled out allowing Ukraine into NATO, viewing that as placing new burdens on the United States and obviating a path to peace with Moscow. Russian authorities said Ukraine targeted Moscow and other cities with a massive drone attack Tuesday, killing three people. Russia's Defense Ministry claimed to have shot down 343  Ukrainian drones over Russian regions.</p>

As a poor country at high risk of debt distress, Afghanistan will struggle to replace American aid. Providing finance for critical programmes that America has cut off could now give it another soft-power advantage.

"Airtel and SpaceX will explore offering Starlink equipment in Airtel's retail stores, Starlink services via Airtel to business customers, opportunities to connect communities, schools, and health centers, among many others, in even the most rural parts of India," the company said in a statement. Starlink's satellite-based system, however, could help bridge the gap and offer high-speed internet, about 25-220 Mbps, to these areas. From the second year, it could cost Rs 1,15,000, Mr Bhargava had said. None of the Indian neighbours, except Bhutan, have access to Starlink.</p>

According to the ministry's data, cited by local media, there has been a significant rise in the number of Indian students selecting Russia as their study destination over the past three years, with enrollment numbers increasing from 19,784 in 2022 to 23,503 in 2023, and then to 31,444 in 2024. Recently, Indians have been facing violent attacks in the US. New Delhi's embassy and consulates have been asked to warn students about potentially dangerous areas of US cities, the minister said, adding that student welfare is “very important,” with over one million Indian citizens currently studying overseas. Canada, another primary destination for Indian students, experienced a 41% drop in enrollment. However, the trend shifted following tensions between the two nations, when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused India of involvement in targeting Sikh separatist leaders in Canada.</p>

IA lost almost half its seats – going from 12 to seven – making it the third-biggest party. The longstanding movement has gained significant traction in recent years after a series of scandals highlighting Denmark's racist treatment of Greenlanders – including the IUD scandal, in which up to 4,500 women and girls were allegedly fitted with the contraceptive device without their knowledge, and “parenting competency” tests that have separated many Inuit children from their parents. Amid worldwide attention largely spurred by Trump, who last week told Congress he would acquire Greenland “one way or the other” and has promised to make Greenlanders rich, turnout in Tuesday's election was higher than usual, election officials said. “Before, people voted mostly Siumut – it was like a football club that they never left. Fencker, who travelled to Washington DC for Trump's election and has been described as “Greenland's most pro-Trump politician”, said that although relations between Greenland and Denmark had been improving under Frederiksen, he wishes she would mirror some of Trump's most recent rhetoric on Greenland, but that he is strongly opposed to any form of US ownership.</p>

Bilal was on the Jafar Express with his mother when the train was caught in an explosive attack, leaving at least three people dead. The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) alleges that the region's natural resources are being exploited by outsiders and has escalated attacks on Pakistanis from other regions in response. Survivors made their way through rugged terrain on Tuesday night to reach the nearest train station, eventually travelling to Mach, roughly 200 kilometres (124 miles) from the Iran border. “I am treating two (police) officers; one was shot five times, while the other was wounded in his knee,” said paramedic Qazim Farooq.</p>

Many women Deen has met have been arrested, detained and labelled as criminals for acts stemming from poverty. Women around the world continue to be arrested under colonial-era laws, including those criminalising abortion, suicide attempts and same-sex relations. Although many of these laws appear gender-neutral, they disproportionately impact women due to patriarchal norms and systemic gender discrimination. In Iran, not wearing a hijab was already a criminal offence under the Islamic penal code, but new morality laws introduced last year allowed significant fines and longer prison sentences of up to 15 years or even the death penalty for “promoting nudity, indecency, unveiling or improper dressing”.</p>

This is a locator map for Yemen with its capital, Sanaa. DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Yemen's Houthi rebels warned shippers early Wednesday that “any Israeli vessel” traveling through nearby Mideast waters is now a target as Israel continues to block aid to the Gaza Strip. The warning from the Houthis again throws into chaos a crucial maritime waterway between Asia and Europe, threatens revenue from Egypt's Suez Canal and possibly will halt aid shipments to war zones. The rebels' secretive leader, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, warned Friday that attacks against Israel-linked vessels would resume within four days if Israel didn't let aid into Gaza. The rebels had targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors during their campaign targeting ships from November 2023 until January of this year.</p>

Loudoun County, Virginia Sheriff's Office spokesperson Thomas Julia told Fox News Digital that 24-year-old Joshua Ribe is a “person of interest” in Konanki's disappearance. Konanki was last spotted at the Riu Republica Resort beach on March 6 around 4:50 am. Ribe first told police that he threw up from the rough surf and went back to shore, but also asked Konanki if she was ok. “We are concerned,” he said Monday, March 10, during his weekly meeting with the press. Meanwhile, Sheriff Mike Chapman of Konanki's hometown in Loudoun County, Virginia, told NewsNation on Monday, March 10, it is “way too premature” to assume the missing student drowned.</p>

Two years later, Musk, 53, claimed he had been deceived into allowing Vivian's medical gender reassignment.

A senior official the US Agency for International Development (USAID), Washington's primary channel for sending money to causes abroad, has reportedly directed remaining staff to destroy sensitive documents stored at the agency's former headquarters, Politico has claimed, citing an internal email. Acting executive secretary Erica Carr has reportedly instructed remaining staff to convene on Tuesday for an “all-day” effort to clear out classified safes and personnel documents at the Ronald Reagan Building. The directive has raised concerns among former USAID staff and legal experts, who argue that it could violate federal record-keeping laws and potentially hinder ongoing lawsuits challenging the agency's restructuring. The billionaire previously called USAID a “criminal organization,” while Trump has claimed it was mismanaged by “radical lunatics.” The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) has also had its government funding frozen.</p>

Le'Veon Bell has now denied claims of the years-long assault and sexual abuse. He also played for the Kansas City Chiefs, Baltimore Ravens and Tampa Bay Buccaneers before nine-year NFL career came to an end. Bell's attorney Thomas W Shaffer has since issued a statement via TMZ: “My client adamantly denies any and all allegations that have been lodged against him.

He said the government would have to spend $58 billion in foreign aid appropriated by Congress at some point, but could legally cancel most of its U.S. Agency for International Development and State Department contracts for future assistance as part of a plan to radically reduce foreign aid. Ali's ruling made clear that he could not dictate how the Trump administration spends congressionally allocated funds going forward. The answer to that question should be an emphatic ‘No,' but a majority of this Court apparently thinks otherwise. I am stunned,” wrote Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh. Lawyers for the government told Ali on Thursday that health organizations had been paid $70 million overnight.</p>

The billionaires present that day - including Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg - had never been richer, flush with big gains from frothy stock markets. Investors piled into equity and crypto markets, expecting that Trump's policies would be advantageous to business. But any expectations that the start of Trump's new term would continue to fuel market returns have been upended. Morningstar analysts said last month that a 10% to 20% tariff on European luxury goods could depress sales, which have already been struggling.

In a motion filed in Washington, DC, federal court, the unions cited an email from USAID's acting executive secretary Erica Carr instructing employees to come to the agency's office on Tuesday for "clearing classified safes and personnel documents." Kelly also wrote that the USAID building would soon be occupied by US Customs and Border Protection. In a separate lawsuit brought by USAID contractors and grant recipients, a federal judge on Monday ruled that the Trump administration cannot refuse to spend foreign aid money appropriated by Congress, although the judge stopped short of restoring canceled contracts. In that case, the Trump administration has repeatedly resisted complying with court orders to release frozen funds.

Abdallah said that once a suspect is in ICC custody, the court schedules an initial appearance hearing. Duterte, a former lawyer turned populist leader, was president between 2016 and 2022, a period in which he advocated for executing alleged criminals and is alleged to have overseen the killings of thousands of people in what authorities portrayed as drug-related cases. It's unclear how many people were killed during Duterte's war on drugs, but Human Rights Watch estimated in 2018 that about 12,000 Filipinos had died since he took office less than two years before. In June 2022, the country's government reported that at least 6,252 people had died “during antidrug operations” since July 2016. In early February, Sara Duterte was impeached by the country's House of Representatives over that threat and corruption allegations.</p>

Musical acts performing at Rising this year include Portishead's Beth Gibbons, who will perform her debut solo album Lives Outgrown in Hamer Hall; English singer Suki Waterhouse; US indie pop band Japanese Breakfast; New Zealand singer Marlon Williams; Kaytetye DJ Rona; US singer Soccer Mommy; and Pete & Bas, the London septuagenarian rap duo and TikTok favourites, who will be performing in Australia for the first time. Rising has built a reputation on mass events that encourage participation, which Fox said she hoped went deeper than simply “immersive”. “Things like Space-out, even 10,000 Kazoos, ask the audience to become a part of making something,” she said.</p>

In video posted by his daughter, former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte questions his detainment after the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued a warrant for his arrest, according to the Philippine government. Duterte was taken into custody on March 11 for alleged crimes against humanity. He has been investigated by the ICC over the anti-drugs crackdown orchestrated during his time in office, which killed more than 6,000 people, a figure based on police data, although independent monitors believe the number of extrajudicial killings could be much higher. CNN has reached out to Interpol and the ICC for comment. CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.</p>

A spectacular and rare celestial event is set to take place on March 14, 2025, as a total lunar eclipse will grace the skies across the entire Western Hemisphere, including the United States. Unlike previous eclipses, this one will be visible in some form from every state in the US, all of North and South America, and parts of Europe and Africa, as reported by MSN. It is at this moment that the moon will take on its iconic crimson hue, giving rise to the "blood moon" effect. A total lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes through Earth's shadow, with the Earth, sun, and moon perfectly aligned. Also read: US startup's moonshot apparently lands on its side - again</p>

Trump made the remarks at a business roundtable on Tuesday, shortly after Ukrainian and American delegations met in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where Kiev agreed to what the US leader described as a “full ceasefire” while Washington unblocked military and intelligence assistance. Otherwise, “we just keep going on,” he said, warning that “lots of people” would be killed. “Hopefully, [Russian President Vladimir Putin] can agree to it also and we can get this show on the road,” Trump added, indicating that he may hold another phone conversation with his Russian counterpart later this week. Kremlin pool reporter Dmitry Smirnov has suggested that a phone call between the US and Russian presidents could take place on Friday. Moscow has previously rejected temporary ceasefires, arguing that they would only allow Kiev to regroup and rearm.</p>

Dozens more cities, including Lucknow, Madrid and Riyadh have suffered a climate “flip” in the last 20 years, switching from dry to wet extremes, or vice versa. “And given that we're looking at the world's largest cities, there are really significant numbers of people involved.” It found that 17 cities across the globe have been hit by climate whiplash, suffering more frequent extremes of both wet and dry conditions. Prolonged droughts can lead to water shortages, disrupted food supplies and electricity blackouts where hydropower is relied upon.

Its workforce included 3,100 people in Washington and an additional 1,100 at regional offices across the country, according to a department website. The office received a record number of complaints in fiscal year 2024, with roughly 22,700 reports filed, according to its annual report. A public database of cases under investigation recently showed more than 1,000 results for Texas, including those at colleges, universities and K-12 school districts. The department sent an email to employees Tuesday telling them its Washington headquarters and regional offices would be closed Wednesday, with access forbidden, before reopening Thursday.</p>

House Republicans narrowly passed their stopgap funding bill Tuesday despite a nearly-united “no” vote from Democrats and one Republican. The measure, a 99-page “clean” continuing resolution that will largely keep government funding at current levels in most areas through September while offering some steep spending cuts in a handful of other places, passed 217-213, with all Republicans except Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky voting for it. Lawmakers have until Friday to handle the matter or risk another potential government shutdown this week. Proposed cuts to DOGE were also left out, with Johnson saying they can be addressed in next year's spending talks. “This means a nearly $945 million cut for the District, impacting teachers, firefighters, and law enforcement,” it added.</p>

Moscow was readying itself to hear details from Tuesday's U.S.-Ukraine meeting, with officials "scrutinizing" the publicly released statements, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday. Last week, the Trump administration announced a freeze on U.S. military aid to and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. "I believe that the meeting itself in Saudi Arabia ruins Russian plans to escalate relations between Ukraine and United States," Zelenskyy said. The president then reiterated his previous claim that Ukraine would be a bigger obstacle in negotiations.

He said those Canadians could be targeted by propaganda campaigns that sell American citizenship as the answer to their economic woes. He says that means finding ways "to use social media more effectively than I believe we have been doing." Bisson says government assistance for those affected by tariffs could blunt the impact of such propaganda.

If you get Global News from Instagram or Facebook - that will be changing. The first full inflation report of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration still left prices running at levels that economists say are inconsistent with the Federal Reserve's two per cent target. Trump early this month triggered a trade war, increasing the tariffs on goods from China to 20 per cent and imposing a new 25 per cent duty on Canadian and Mexican imports, before dialling back and providing a one-month exemption for any goods that meet the rules of origin under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade. Enhanced steel and aluminum tariffs took effect this week, drawing swift retaliation from Europe. Consumers, fearful of higher prices, likely rushed to buy goods like motor vehicles and other big-ticket items, which could show up in February and if not, then in the coming months.</p>

The Department of Education initiated mass layoffs on Tuesday night, reducing its workforce by nearly 50%, sources told ABC News. Impacted staff will be placed on administrative leave starting March 21, a statement from the Education Department said. "Today's reduction in force reflects the Department of Education's commitment to efficiency, accountability, and ensuring that resources are directed where they matter most: to students, parents, and teachers," said Secretary of Education Linda McMahon shortly after the notifications went out on Tuesday. The email also instructed employees to take their laptops home with them after work on Tuesday. "People are petrified to do their jobs," an Education Department employee told ABC News recently.</p>

Members of several families who lost loved ones said in a statement that the NTSB's preliminary report showed this was not an isolated incident. Aviation lawyer Robert Clifford, who represents at least six families, said the airline had a responsibility to address known problems. Investigators have identified 15,000 instances of planes getting alerts about helicopters being in close proximity between October 2021 and December 2024, she said. President Donald Trump blamed the midair collision on what he called an “obsolete” air traffic control system and promised to replace it. Federal officials have been raising concerns about an overtaxed and understaffed air traffic control system for years, especially after a series of close calls at airports.</p>

Zoom out further, however, and Intel's stock price is down 54% over the past 12 months. AI chip giant Nvidia's stock price is off 14% year to date on concerns that the AI trade has run its course and that tariffs and export controls will handicap the company's sales moving forward.

"While it is still too early to see much impact of new tariffs on economic activity, our surveys suggest that threats of new tariffs and uncertainty about the Canada-U.S. trade relationship are already having a big impact on business and consumer intentions," he said during his Wednesday news conference. As Macklem noted, less spending by businesses and consumers tends to put downward pressure on inflation. Meanwhile, the bank's preferred measures of core inflation are still above two per cent, mainly driven by housing-related price growth, adding to its concerns. The weak Canadian dollar poses a challenge to importers, because it means the products they bring in will be more expensive; retaliatory tariffs imposed by Canada will also add costs; and uncertainty itself adds costs, because businesses are looking for new suppliers and new markets to sustain themselves. As one reporter pointed out, Macklem never used the word recession in his remarks, which some economists have said is a likely outcome given that tariffs will hamper growth.</p>

"Yes, Tesla has a chance" to succeed with its new appeal, said Tulane University law professor Ann Lipton. These so-called "Dexits" were followed by decisions from executives at other companies to reincorporate elsewhere, including Bill Ackman's hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, as some aired their frustrations with Delaware's powerful Chancery Court. The measure is not retroactive and, therefore, wouldn't absolve Musk or other litigants from past determinations. The fact that Tesla stockholders have since received a return of more than $700 billion on their investment in Musk, they said, shows the compensation plan exemplified alignment between executive and stockholder interests. As for cleansing, he said, "I can see the court saying, 'You were a little too tough here.'"</p>

"Our revised estimates reflect the recently reduced GDP growth forecast of our US Economics team, a higher assumed tariff rate, and higher level of uncertainty that is typically associated with a greater equity risk premium," Kostin wrote. Kostin noted a catalyst that improves the economic growth outlook, either evidenced by stronger economic data or a reduced tariff policy plan that could spur an upturn in stocks.

But now, he said, “it's very difficult to price an IPO when we're getting these swings in the market.” Goldman CEO David Solomon told Fox Business on Wednesday that he still expects IPOs to rise this year. CoreWeave's IPO is being led by Morgan Stanley (MS), JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs, along with 11 other advisers. “Normally, when you have a sell-off like the one that we've been having, in addition to just volatility and macro uncertainty, you're seeing headlines of companies pumping the brakes, killing their IPO plan,” he said.</p>

People protesting against Tesla should be labelled domestic terrorists, President Donald Trump said on Tuesday at a White House media event designed to bolster Elon Musk's electric car company. Trump said they were "harming a great American company", and anyone using violence against the electric carmaker would "go through hell". "When we look at new orders, for example in Europe and China, you can see that they've effectively halved over the last year," she said. Investors are "certainly getting more worried about an economic slowdown too, so the richest-valued companies like Tesla have been hit hardest in recent days", Ms James said. Despite his supportive comments, President Trump's policies so far have been designed to limit electric car sales in the US, including revoking a 2021 order by former president Joe Biden that half of all car sales should be electric by 2030, and halting unspent government funds for charging stations.</p>

It's a tariff-first focus that is perhaps not surprising to observers of Trump who saw him prioritize tariffs above all else at nearly every campaign stop in 2024. This time around, Trump is clearly choosing tariffs so far, with markets repeatedly underestimating his pain tolerance. The world's second-largest economy is now facing overall duties of about 30% with Trump 1.0 tariffs still in place. Also in place are 25% duties on a range of goods from Mexico and Canada.

The S&P 500 is down almost 9% from its February high, putting it in correction territory. New tariffs were briefly expected to go even higher for Canada, the top U.S. export market. In a Truth Social post Monday, Trump called Canada a longtime “tariff abuser,” going beyond his metals threats to say that “The United States is not going to be subsidizing Canada any longer,” and that “We don't need your Cars, we don't need your Lumber, we don't your Energy, and very soon, you will find that out.” Perhaps the sharpest response came from China, the world's largest steel producer and second-largest economy, which had already been slapped with a 20% blanket tariff on Trump's return to office, and announced new tariffs in return. America's Asian allies in South Korea and Japan — both are major steel producers — were also hit.</p>

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is nearly 10% off its most recent record high as fears over slowing economic growth have gripped investors and spawned a stock market sell-off.

Still, some strategists tell Yahoo Finance that a traditional recession playbook might not work in the current market moment. "It's hard to say that [the market] is pricing in slow growth or no growth because one of the things that makes this environment so difficult — if you talk to almost any company or listen to what they're saying— there's basically no visibility on the macro outlook or on their own outlooks, because of tariff and trade policy," Charles Schwab senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon told Yahoo Finance.

MORGANTOWN — To say that WVU football – and the philosophies of head coach Rich Rodriguez – are ingrained in his son Rhett would be an understatement.

While his coaching resume is short, he has experience as a Football Bowl Subdivision quarterback at two schools – Arizona and Louisiana-Monroe.

Southwest, which built years of advertising campaigns around its policy of letting passengers check up to two bags for free, said Tuesday that people who haven't either reached the upper tiers of its Rapid Rewards loyalty program, bought a business class ticket or hold the airline's credit card will have to pay for checked bags. All other leading U.S. airlines charge for checked luggage, and Wall Street has long argued that Southwest was leaving money behind. “I would rather have the free checked bags, that's for sure,” said customer Dorothy Severson, who was awaiting a flight Tuesday at Chicago Midway International Airport. Layoffs fell slightly in January, and the number of Americans quitting their jobs rose. Weinberg and Chen said that Tuesday's JOLTS report is unlikely to sway the Federal Reserve from its cautious approach toward cutting interest rates this year.</p>

With its chart, the union showed that it is attempting to negotiate specific AI language — provisions, for instance, that end performers' consent for use of their digital replica during a strike, that require additional reports from the studios regarding their use of digital replicas and that necessitate employer disclosure of whether a performer's voice will be combined with any other voices in a digital replica or whether it will be used for any kind of generative AI chatbot. The chart also demonstrates that the two parties have reached provisional deals on some issues: They have agreed to mandating that actors give their consent for digital replicas made using their performances and agreed on the amount of information that performers will receive about how their digital replicas are intended to be used in employment contracts. Nearly two years into their long-running negotiations with video game studios, SAG-AFTRA called a strike against those companies in July 2024. Negotiations have taken place in starts and stops ever since, with union performers occasionally picketing struck companies. The labor group's latest demonstration, at Disney Character Voices in Burbank, will take place on March 18.</p>

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese gestures during a press conference in Sydney, Wednesday, March 12, 2025. Such a decision by the Trump administration is entirely unjustified,” Albanese said. This is why Australia will not be imposing reciprocal tariffs on the United States,” Albanese added. “Malcolm Turnbull, the former Prime Minister of Australia who was always leading that wonderful country from 'behind', never understood what was going on in China, nor did he have the capacity to do so,” Trump wrote on social media. Trump was responding to an interview Turnbull gave this week to U.S. media company Bloomberg in which the former Australian leader said Chinese President Xi Jinping would take advantage of the U.S. president's chaotic and erratic leadership.</p>

I can understand if citizens feel insecure," said Erik Jensen, leader of government coalition partner Siumut. Reuters spoke to more than a dozen Greenlanders in Nuuk, all of whom said they favored independence, although many expressed concern that a swift transition could damage the economy and eliminate Nordic welfare services like universal healthcare and free schooling. The island holds substantial natural resources, including critical minerals such as rare earths used in high-tech industries, ranging from electric vehicles to missile systems. In an interview aired on Monday by Danish broadcaster DR, he dismissed Trump's offer as disrespectful, expressing willingness to cooperate with other countries instead. All six main political parties support independence but differ on how and when it could be achieved.</p>

Indicators like PI Cycle, MVRV Z-Score and Reserve Risk are used to identify whether it is a Bitcoin bull or bear market. The market sentiment is tense, and trade tensions have escalated again, with new tariffs expected to be implemented on April 2nd. With bearish sentiment building, traders are turning to downside hedging strategies, especially as volatility surges across both traditional and crypto markets.

The recent GENIUS stablecoin bill is merely a thinly veiled attempt to usher in central bank digital currency (CBDC) controls through privatized means, according to Jean Rausis, co-founder of the Smardex decentralized trading platform. Decentralized alternatives to centralized stablecoins, such as algorithmic stablecoins and synthetic dollars, will prove to be a valuable bulwark against this creeping government control over crypto, Rausis concluded. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, introduced by Tennessee Senator Bill Hagerty on Feb. 4, proposed a comprehensive framework for overcollateralized stablecoins such as Tether's USDt (USDT) and Circle's USDC (USDC). The bill was revamped to include stricter Anti-Money Laundering, reserve requirements, liquidity provisions and sanctions checks on March 13. These additional provisions will presumably give US-based stablecoin issuers an edge over their offshore counterparts.</p>

Hemi, founded by early Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik, plans to unify Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two oldest and largest blockchains, into "a single supernetwork," according to an emailed announcement. The project raised $15 million in a funding round led by Binance Labs last September. The project is one of several looking to transform the broader blockchain landscape, particularly with regard to decentralized finance (DeFi), through combining Bitcoin and Ethereum due in part to the deep stores of value held in bitcoin (BTC), which comfortably exceed those of every other digital asset combined.

LINCOLN, NE — Governor Jim Pillen has signed LB609 into law. This bipartisan, law-enforcement-supported legislation establishes the Controllable Electronic Record Fraud Prevention Act to help combat fraud and protect users of cryptocurrency kiosks/ATMs. “An important part of these efforts is to make sure that we have guardrails to prevent criminals from taking advantage of Nebraskans. "That also means we need to increase transparency to assure those doing legal business in the State of Nebraska that you are absolutely welcome. Of course, those that target our citizens, that look to exploit Nebraskans and their financial resources, using Crypto ATMs as part of their transfer method, we will soon have a team that will be watching even more closely."</p>

This phenomenon has been causing a slight identity crisis for believers and skeptics, who need to rethink their positions. Whether viewed as the next retail-driven market movement or an unsustainable mania, one thing is clear: Memecoins are no longer a joke. While one trader might turn $66 into a $3 million profit, thousands of others end up holding worthless tokens when the hype fades. The real question is: Can memecoins transition from hype-driven speculation to a structured financial asset with governance and longevity? Rather than relying on short-term speculation, Floki Inu integrated non-fungible token (NFT) gaming, payments and educational initiatives, proving that memecoins can evolve into structured, community-driven assets.</p>

Russia plans a three-year crypto trial for select investors under an experimental legal regime to regulate digital currencies and market transparency. The central bank reiterated that other residents cannot settle payments using crypto. According to the central bank, such a framework would introduce standards for crypto asset service providers in Russia and expand investment opportunities for experienced investors willing to take on increased risks. “The Bank of Russia has repeatedly noted that private cryptocurrencies are not issued or guaranteed by any jurisdiction, based on mathematical algorithms and are subject to increased volatility,” the authority stated, adding: A number of companies worldwide, including Elon Musk's Tesla, Japan's Metaplanet and Brazilian fintech unicorn Meliuz, have started purchasing BTC since Saylor's Strategy purchased its first coins in August 2020.</p>

Bitcoin, unlike gold and oil, is not an official reserve asset, but the US government possesses a significant amount through confiscations. While Bitcoin custody does not require physical storage facilities, cybersecurity risks such as hacking, private key mismanagement and regulatory oversight present major challenges. As of March 10, 2025, Bitcoin's value declined by more than 5% to approximately $79,515, reflecting market disappointment over the reserve's funding approach. These reserves will be funded exclusively through cryptocurrencies seized during law enforcement operations, ensuring no taxpayer funds are utilized.

Bitcoin may get a price boost as the US debt suspension ends on March 14 and injects fresh liquidity into markets. The US Treasury hit its $36 trillion debt ceiling a day after President Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. Beyond global tariff uncertainty, “concerns such as inflation, interest rates and geopolitical issues remain unresolved,” Lee added. This may also tighten liquidity conditions, making risk assets such as Bitcoin “less attractive in the short to medium term,” Wo said.

According to a recent report, Gramegna cautioned that the U.S. administration's endorsement of cryptocurrencies, especially dollar-backed stablecoins, could potentially threaten Europe's monetary autonomy. In stark contrast, President Trump's administration is advocating for an expansive embrace of digital assets. The U.S. government has initiated several pro-crypto executive orders championing global growth in dollar-denominated stablecoins. ECB President Christine Lagarde firmly clarified the institution's stance on cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, dismissing any inclusion within Europe's central bank reserves. Her position stresses the need for reserves that remain "liquid, secure, and safe," thereby excluding volatile digital assets like Bitcoin.</p>

One of the best examples is ransomware, malicious software that prevents users from accessing their computer files, systems or networks unless they pay a ransom. Crypto is the dominant form of payment demanded in these attacks because it enables cybercriminals to receive money anonymously and quickly transfer their illicit gains overseas. One investor wrote on social media, “I am a huge fan of Hawk Tuah but you took my life savings.” Beaufort County, S.C., which has a large senior population, reported $3.1 million in losses to crypto scams last year, including several involving bitcoin ATMs. The SEC's new leaders say they don't want crypto to “be a haven for fraudsters.” Unfortunately, it already is.</p>

The exchange's whale ratio has, in fact, exhibited a broad downtrend since mid-January when BTC/USD hit its latest all-time highs. “Currently, this ratio is declining, implying that Binance's whales are reducing their selling pressure,” the post continued.

You're reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool's Premium Investing Services. Bitcoin's transactions can take more than an hour to clear, and they cost about $0.37 at the absolute minimum. This process is too technical for most investors who might be interested in holding some assets on the blockchain, and there are not yet any streamlined ways of doing it. In other words, it could be supplanted by a more specialized chain that does the job even better. So it probably isn't going to be a significant driver of its price unless that changes.</p>

Bitcoin's “top buyers” are selling heavily, with onchain analytics firm Glassnode calling it a “moderate capitulation event.” Bitcoin buyers who purchased around when it hit a $109,000 all-time peak in January are now panic-selling as the cryptocurrency declines, says onchain analytics firm Glassnode, which isn't ruling out that Bitcoin could slide to $70,000. At the time of publication, it's $91,362 — up about 47% in five months, according to Bitbo data. Market research firm 10x Research labeled it a “textbook correction” in a March 10 note, adding that with Bitcoin's dip below $80,000, “approximately 70% of all selling came from investors who bought within the last three months.” Glassnode explained that a similar sell-off Bitcoin pattern was seen in August when Bitcoin fell from $68,000 to around $49,000 amid fears of a recession, poor employment data in the United States, and sluggish growth among leading tech stocks.</p>

Scientists have found ancient nail tooth shark fossils deep inside Mammoth Cave in Kentucky, revealing new information about a mysterious group of extinct predators. Researchers collecting fossils deep inside Kentucky's Mammoth Cave have uncovered the remains of a never-before-seen species — an absolutely tiny ancient shark with nail-like teeth. The species name is named after David McGinnis, a retired National Park Service superintendent, and their teeth, which resemble old iron nails. Discoveries like McGinnis' nail tooth enable researchers to learn more about long-extinct sharks and the ecosystems they inhabited.

Coordinated activity within this network typically decreases with age, suggesting that child-rearing — which involves learning new skills — may provide long-lasting protection against brain aging. But limiting child-rearing research to biological phenomena can overlook the environmental influences experienced by parents of all sexes. Parenthood may shift brain region coordination in the opposite direction of age-related decline by providing a complex and novel environment that lasts for decades, Orchard says. Other factors that influence the number of children, such as virility and societal norms surrounding parenthood, may also play a role.

According to Yanjuan Gu at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, recent studies looking into mitochondria have revealed its potential as a cancer therapy target. “Tumor cells exhibit varying mitochondrial membrane potentials,” said Gu, meaning the drug may be less efficient in some cancers. According to Gu, there are few standardized frameworks for evaluating exosome-based nanodrugs, particularly in terms of immunogenicity and long-term toxicity. Despite these challenges, “we believe that OXA@Exo-RD represents a promising yet resource-intensive approach for treating chemoresistant cancers,” said Gu. Reference: Xiaohui Wang et al.

Essentially, enterprises operating in terrains where terrestrial fibre access is not available will provide the catchment of enterprise customers for service providers. Enterprise customers will also not be as price sensitive as non-business consumers, experts said since there are use cases which will help solve problems of connectivity which terrestrial telecom networks have not been able to do so far. “Whether it is Starlink or any other player, B2C pricing will need to be aided by government subsidies.

However, with the right settings and optimisations, you can still get an excellent audio experience on Spotify. Many users may not notice any difference at all unless they use high-end headphones or speakers. This simply means you need better earphones, headphones, or speakers to get the best possible music-streaming experience on Spotify. Until Spotify HiFi is released, these optimisations ensure you get the best possible audio output. Spotify's high-bitrate format, coupled with proper settings and high-quality audio gear, can still provide an impressive listening experience.</p>

Top 10 lock -- Collin Moriakwa: There's a clear closing problem with Morikawa -- look no further than Bay Hill last Sunday. Scheffler winning three straight is certainly possible given his immense skill, but he still needs to put it all together in 2025. I'd rather back him at these odds than someone twice as long who is far less likely to win. Being given twice as many spots in which to back a guy who has already defended his title at The Players feels generous, but I'll take it. Surprise prediction -- Rickie Fowler contends on Sunday: There is nothing from his season thus far that points to Fowler making a run at TPC Sawgrass, though he does have two finishes near the top 10 this year, and obviously he's won at this course before.</p>

The NFL's new year officially starts at 4 p.m. ET on Wednesday, and the New England Patriots still have work to do. While the Patriots have agreed to deals with eight players since the league's legal tampering window opened on Monday, they have yet to land a starting left tackle or a No. Will they use the "official" beginning of free agency to fill those needs, or will they explore other avenues for an upgrade?

A 2017 third-round pick, Kupp became an immediate contributor inside Rams head coach Sean McVay's offense. Despite his recent injury issues, expect several teams to be interested in bidding for Kupp's services, especially those that could use a sure-handed veteran wideout with playoff experience. Dallas needs some reinforcements around CeeDee Lamb, especially with Brandin Cooks hitting the open market. There's also a personal connection since new Cowboys wide receivers coach Junior Adams coached Kupp in college at Eastern Washington. Seattle also lured the top free agent quarterback available in Pro Bowler Sam Darnold, who agreed to a three-year, $100.5 million contract.</p>

The Los Angeles Rams have informed Cooper Kupp that he will be released Wednesday, per NFL Network's Tom Pelissero. Kupp had 1,947 yards and 16 touchdowns on 145 catches that season, all of which led the league. Soon to be 32, Kupp had two years left on his three-year, $80 million deal. He was owed $20 million next season and just shy of that mark in 2026. Now that he's been released, Kupp is expected to have interest from multiple teams.</p>

NFL teams benefit greatly when their players drafted outside for the first couple of rounds or so perform right way. The NFL's Performance-Based Pay program is a collectively bargained benefit that compensates players in accordance to how much they play relative to their draft slot, which determines a player's rookie deal value. He took in $985,000 in 2024, but with the league's program, he will receive another sum of $857,842 -- nearly the same figure as his 2024 salary. The great news for teams is these bonuses do not affect their players' cap hits. Another notable winner from this program was 2024 first-team All-Pro Detroit Lions safety Kerby Joseph, who led the NFL with nine interceptions this past season.</p>

The suits were found by officials and as a result two gold medalists,  Marius Lindvik and Johann André Forfang have now been disqualified from the world championships for their modified suits. “FIS has provisionally suspended three Norwegian team officials and two athletes who are being investigated for their alleged involvement in illegal equipment manipulation.” I don't really have anything else to say other than that we got carried away in our bubble.” Results of recent competitions are now being reviewed to determine whether or not the Norwegian team cheated at past events. If an investigation concludes there have been more incidents it could affect the lead up to the 2026 Winter Olympics, set to take place in Milano-Cortina in February of next year.</p>

This year's IBSF World Championships are taking place at a location that is truly legendary for our sports. It was here over 95 years ago that the first bobsleds sped down North America's first-ever sliding track built at Mt Van Hoevenberg, Lake Placid. As historically significant as this track already is, having hosted so many major international sliding events, it has also played an instrumental role in the development of women's sliding sports, with the creation of a new women's bobsled program in 1981. It's perhaps no surprise that several high profile Team USA athletes call this track home - including Mystique Ro, who just last week won silver in women's skeleton and a day later gold in the mixed skeleton team event which will make its debut at Milano-Cortina 2026. Jamaica Bobsleigh, before making its famous debut at 1988 Calgary Olympic Games, was training in Lake Placid - and ever since has been coming back.</p>

"It is an incredible place to live with a huge community of expats, entrepreneurial spirit and nice tax advantages," Ryan Downton told CBS Sports. If Pavia plays it right this season, he could set himself up for years whether the NFL comes calling or not. Other athletes, including Tennessee baseball player Alberto Osuna in the same state where Pavia won his ruling, have not been as fortunate. The Pavia action isn't exactly a one-off for him, but Downton says he typically pursues "health care and security fraud stuff ... that take years to resolve."

Auburn forward Johni Broome, Duke forward Cooper Flagg, Alabama guard Mark Sears and Purdue point guard Braden Smith make up the rest of the First Team. "A year ago, Clayton functioned primarily as a shooter and scorer and averaged just 2.6 assists, which was fine because that was not his job. Clayton's scoring fell by less than half a point per game, but his assists were up by nearly two and his turnovers were nearly flat." DeCourcy picked Clayton's 22-point, 8-assist and 5-rebound night in a road win against Alabama one week ago as the defining game of his season.</p>

There are conflicting reports regarding when the Steelers may get an answer from Rodgers. Darnold agreed to a three-year, $100.5 million deal with the Seahawks, leaving Rodgers as their primary option. On Tuesday, after a two-day period that saw Pittsburgh trade for wideout DK Metcalf and come to terms with free agents Malik Harrison and Darius Slay, Steelers general manager Omar Khan spent the day focusing on his quarterback position. Pittsburgh also hasn't ruled out the possibility of re-signing Russell Wilson. Pittsburgh doesn't currently have a single quarterback on it's roster; that needs to change quickly regardless of Rodgers' situation, hence the reported call from Pittsburgh to Rudolph.</p>

The Bruins have only lost two games this season and both were to rival USC. They have also quietly been one of the top rebounding teams with players like Liatu King. That being said, the Tigers were competing without leading scorer Flau'Jae Johnson, who is resting while dealing with shin inflammation. That was Mulkey's decision because she wants Johnson to be fully healthy for the NCAA Tournament.

During the NFL's legal tampering period, the Bears agreed to terms with several top-tier free agents that include defensive tackle Grady Garrett, defensive end Dayo Odeyingbo, center Drew Dalman and guard Joe Thuney. "I feel like the Bears have unlimited f---ing money," St. Brown recently said on his podcast, via NFL Media. The Bears are taking full advatage of the fact that their starting quarterback, Caleb Williams, is playing under a rookie contract, which gives Chicago more spending money than most teams. The Bears have specifically focused on upgrading their offensive and defensive lines after both units struggled in 2024. The Bears have already had a busy offseason, but don't expect them to slow down anytime soon with free agency officially starting on Wednesday and the NFL Draft just over a month away.</p>

That also means we might see more players released, such as Los Angeles Rams WR Cooper Kupp. New England did add at the receiver position, bringing in Mack Hollins, but upgrades are still needed around Drake Maye. But Kupp would give Nix a security blanket underneath and over the middle, and is an ideal fit for what Sean Payton wants to dial up in the passing game. While durability may be a concern with Kupp given his recent injury history, with players like Courtland Sutton, Marvin Mims Jr., Troy Franklin, and Devaughn Vele already in place the Broncos can manage Kupp's snaps, keeping him fresh and hopefully healthy for the entire season. Under new offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak Seattle may rely less on three-WR personnel packages, but a duo of Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Kupp in the passing game is a solid pairing.</p>

Alabama has to replace veteran starter Jalen Milroe, who posted his fair share of wow moments but never quite put it all together with the Crimson Tide. Leaning more on Callaway, who engineered some of the FCS' best passing offenses during his time at Samford from 2016-19, would be a smart step. It should go without saying that Georgia doesn't lack in talent on defense, but spring will be key for some young players stepping up to fill the void. It's not all bad, though; South Carolina does at least return Freshman All-American Dylan Stewart, a former five-star prospect that finished his first year of college football with 6.5 sacks and 10.5 tackles for loss. While that's important, Tennessee wouldn't have to lean on its run game as much if a handful of reliable receivers emerge.</p>

A few hours into Monday afternoon it felt like the Minnesota Vikings hadn't woken up yet. There were also salient questions about whether or not we've seen the absolute ceiling of Darnold's ability, and it still didn't get the Vikes any closer to winning a championship than with Kirk Cousins — so why blow cap space on that? This is easily enough to find some rotational players for depth, and that's extremely exciting if you're a Vikings fan. If Jones stayed in Minnesota he would have been competing to be a caretaker, at best. We're seeing massive retraction at WR as teams pivot to interior blocking and a greater emphasis on running backs.</p>

Now the Steelers have found his potential replacement, on Tuesday striking a one-year pact with former Philadelphia Eagles running back Kenneth Gainwell, according to multiple reports. With Harris gone in Pittsburgh, the Steelers all but guaranteed fellow running back Jaylen Warren's return with a restricted free agent tender, putting Warren in line to take over as the top ball carrier. Gainwell's reported entrance could result in more of an even split in carries, as the ex-Eagles veteran also has extensive experience as a pass-catching option out of the backfield. He logged at least 20 catches in each of his first three seasons in Philadelphia, also earning the Eagles staff's trust as a third-down pass blocker. While his rushing totals were minimal working behind Barkley, D'Andre Swift and Miles Sanders from 2021-2024, Gainwell served as the Eagles' most productive running back during their Super Bowl LVII bid in 2022, averaging 5.5 yards per carry that postseason.</p>

In response to the sport no longer being male-dominated, colleges started to discourage men's participation in cheer and dismissed it as “solely a feminine occupation.” Its legitimacy as a sport has been questioned ever since. The NCAA defines a sport as “an institutional activity, sponsored at the varsity or club level, involving physical exertion for competition against teams or individuals within an intercollegiate competition structure… [that operates] under standardized rules with rating/scoring systems ratified by at least one official regulatory agency and/or governing body.” Historically, competitive cheer and dance teams fell short of being recognized by the NCAA because sidelining at games meant that these teams did not exist for the sole purpose of competing. These teams bring championships and national recognition to their respective universities, but still aren't counted as a sport by the NCAA. Athletes often find themselves denied access to university programs meant for student-athletes because of their lack of NCAA status, such as cheerleaders at Louisiana State University who were excluded from athletic meals. Dismissing women-dominated sports is not just an issue of semantics, but it actively harms athletes involved.</p>

I'm a big fan of this deal because it shows some prudent self-scouting by the Rams' front office. Bynum is a sweet fit in new DC Lou Anarumo's offense, using instincts and impressive timing to make plays on the ball rather than raw athleticism. I actually thought Koonce would get more money somewhere else, but seeing him go back to Vegas on a one-year deal worth $12M is such nice value and a great way of retaining the good players on the Vegas roster. Koonce is coming off a knee injury, but when healthy he provides such a burst of speed and explosion off the edge that it really meshes well with EDGE Maxx Crosby and DT Christian Wilkins. On top of that, this deal is only a one-year contract and will only cost the Chargers up to $9.5M, meaning they can keep their eyes open for any rookies to help the room out.</p>

Yes, you read that correctly: A conference with 16 teams could realistically send 14 of them to The Big Dance. Looking ahead: Historic regular-season success doesn't guarantee anything in the crucible that is March Madness. Lamine Yamal sparked Barcelona into the Champions League quarterfinals on Tuesday, adding to a growing-but-already-quite-large sample size of greatness. Underestimate either one, and you'd be in the clubhouse signing your scorecard well before he was.

EDO's report highlighted that brands generated strong results when pairing ads featuring women athletes and sports themes during games. As well as noting that women's basketball was continuing its ‘meteoritic rise', EDO also found that a new crop of women's sports is gaining traction with viewers, with advertisers subsequently taking notice. Notably, the 2024 NCAA women's volleyball championship game between Penn State and Louisville was deemed to be 51 per cent more effective for advertisers than the average primetime programme. “Women's sports has officially graduated from TV advertising's best-kept secret to one of its most reliable performers,” said Laura Grover, senior vice president and head of client solutions at EDO. Grover believes that the cultural momentum behind women's sports is “unstoppable”, adding that it is an “increasingly risky bet” for brands still opting not to get involved.</p>

Before branding himself from now until eternity as the general manager who gave away Luka Doncic, Nico Harrison had a good thing going. As usual, Jerry's under heavy fire for not throwing big money at anyone other than his own, and even then only when too late. Young, who hired the best Rangers manager ever, likes to swing big (Jacob deGrom, Corey Seager, Marcus Semien). Pederson's off to a slow start, but here's betting Burger puts up better power numbers at first base than any Ranger since Mark Teixeira. Now Mavs fans have to live with it, and they'll no doubt do so long after Nico's tenure here is over.</p>

Read on as we make the case for both sides - and have your say in our poll. Any team would lack a cutting edge when missing the likes of Bukayo Saka, Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus. Boasting the likes of Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham, Rodrygo and Vinicius Jr, it is not in their make-up. The biggest factor in Real Madrid's European success is the quality of their players, but all those historic nights have also equipped them with a level of belief and durability that no other side possesses in this competition. Consider how they beat Bayern Munich in last season's semi-finals, thanks to an extraordinary late double from substitute Joselu.</p>

PARKERSBURG — After scoring a 24-point win over Huntington less than a month ago the Parkersburg South Patriots had to like their chances at home against the Highlanders in Tuesday night's Class AAAA regional co-final. That pressure defense coupled with the red-hot shooting of sophomore Pierson Dejneka got Huntington right back into it.

Soto isn't as blessed defensively, but the Mets will live with that component of his game provided he keeps stacking up 30-homer, .400-OBP seasons. He'll round out a rotation that now looks significantly stronger and deeper on paper than Arizona's recent iterations. Another talented left-handed starter, Fried (and his eight-year, $218 million contract) was part of the Yankees' pivot after losing out on Juan Soto. He's coming off a season that saw him set career highs in both home runs (32) and stolen bases (21).</p>

The shot was incredible in a vacuum, but it also carried significant playoff implications. It is entirely possible that this shot winds up swinging home-court advantage in a first-round series between the Pacers and Bucks, or changing who winds up facing who when the first round arrives.

Cutting Medicaid funding and halting the program's expansion would result in providers revenues decreasing by about $80 billion, and uncompensated care on behalf of uninsured people would increase by $18.9 billion in 2026 due to declines in health insurance coverage, finds a report from the Urban Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. About 10.8 million more people would become uninsured if all states were to drop the Medicaid expansion, with the number of uninsured increasing by 50% or more in half of expansion states, data showed. Because lower spending on healthcare services means lower revenue for providers and fewer services rendered, the resulting decline in revenue could have adverse consequences, particularly for hospitals that are already financially at risk, authors said. In addition to having negative spillover effects on the local economy, hospital closures could reduce access to and use of hospital services, increasing the mortality risk for heart attacks, unintentional injuries and time-sensitive conditions. Medicaid expansion enrollment increased last year due to seven states implementing expansion in 2020 or later, as well as adoption of the continuous enrollment provision, a pandemic-era policy that prohibited states from disenrolling people from Medicaid in exchange for enhanced federal funding, a January KFF study found.</p>

They noted that flooding impacts health in various ways, including drowning, electrical injuries, and hypothermia. Additionally, flooding-related infrastructure damage can disrupt health services, displace individuals, and create broader societal challenges. To address these gaps, they analyzed the relationship between large-scale flood events and health care use among Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 or older residing in zip code tabulation areas (ZCTAs) affected by such events between 2008 and 2017. Also, the primary outcomes measured included incident rate ratios (IRRs) with corresponding 95% CIs. The study population contained 11,801,527 Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 or older, with a mean (SD) age of 74.4 (7.6) years.</p>

If all states that have expanded Medicaid drop their programs, the number of uninsured, non-elderly adults would increase by nearly 11 million. The healthcare sector would also likely see reduced revenue, as uninsured people seek out less medical care. These cuts would have major ripple effects on local economies, especially in rural areas.” Providers would also take a financial hit from an increased burden of services that aren't reimbursed.

"The difference with ambient AI is it's actually more close to an intelligent human scribe," Dr. Nishit Patel, Vice President and Chief Medical Informatics Officer at Tampa General Hospital, said. ABC Action News reporter Michael Paluska recently reported on those doctors for the ongoing series, "Patient No More.” "Are insurance companies using AI to really kick out and deny batch claims by the hundreds or maybe thousands at one moment?"

Those costs currently also are not billable, and hence the result is pressure to see more patients. Let's consider a hospital system implementing one of these generative AI tools to assist physicians with clinical documentation. These systems perform double checks on the information, confirm its veracity and use sophisticated methods to minimize errors. As AI technologies rapidly advance, major medical organizations need to provide guidance documents, and boilerplate policies that can help institutions adopt best practices.</p>

The CMS' 2025 Marketplace Integrity and Affordability Proposed Rule includes proposals that take steps to protect people from being enrolled in Marketplace coverage without their knowledge or consent, promote stable and affordable health insurance markets, and ensure taxpayer dollars fund financial assistance only for the people the ACA set out to support. According to a press release by CMS, “After the 2023 benefit year closed, CMS began receiving a dramatic uptick in complaints from consumers who claimed they had been enrolled in Marketplace coverage without their consent. Additionally, the availability of the monthly special enrollment period (SEP) for individuals with household incomes below 150 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) would end, a policy that currently allows people to wait to enroll until they become sick instead of promoting continuous enrollment. CMS proposes a policy that would add sex-trait modification to the list of items and services that may not be covered as essential health benefits beginning in plan year 2026. In line with Trump's Executive Order on Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders, the proposed rule would also revert to a previous definition of “lawfully present” that excludes Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients for purposes of enrolling in Marketplace coverage.</p>

Landmark, which operates six hospitals across three states, will kick off a marketing process for its facilities in the coming weeks as it seeks new capital providers or owners. Contract labor costs in particular exploded, rising 229% since 2020, while salaries, wages and benefits for skilled nurses grew by about 29%. Landmark's debts include a $30 million loan to Amerant Bank and approximately $13 million in outstanding lease payments to two real estate investment trusts which own the underlying real estate for its hospital portfolio. Last year, Steward Health Care's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing dominated headlines as the company sold off its massive portfolio of 31 hospitals. Health systems filing for Chapter 11 restructuring have cited insufficient reimbursements from government programs as a contributing strain on their finances.</p>

Your company is spending a lot on traditional healthcare coverage — and probably multiple supplemental wellness offerings — to help workers manage chronic conditions. Providing a single-point solution that helps employees manage multiple conditions can improve their health, consolidate benefits and cut down on employer costs. Many of the people managing chronic conditions do not fall into the super high-claimant category, but they require far more than just basic wellness perks to improve their health, says Kurt Cegielski, chief commercial officer at MOBE, a platform that helps people manage their health, including chronic conditions, lifestyle habits and medications. Cegielski describes this middle-ground population as one that interacts frequently with the healthcare system, but trying to navigate numerous employer-provided solutions for individual health issues makes things needlessly complicated. With an estimated one in five corporate employees identifying as neurodivergent, there's a real payoff to making accommodations for this segment of the workforce.</p>

They said the “unfunded mandates associated with this regulation would place an undue financial strain on hospitals and healthcare systems.” The EHR Association also stressed that continuing to offer flexibility in the finalized policies will be essential to avoid adding excessive or unmanageable burden for smaller organizations that may have only a few staff members (and, in some cases, may not have even one team member focused on compliance with the security rule). Regarding business associate contracts, the EHR Association recommends that OCR provide specific examples of what constitutes sufficient “assurances” in Business Associate Agreements (BAAs), such as ISO certifications, SOC 2 Type II reports, or similar industry-recognized security attestations. To help regulated entities balance security and system efficiency, OCR should provide clear guidance on appropriate encryption levels within a system, given the multiple layers where encryption can be applied, the group said. This would enable organizations to meet compliance obligations while optimizing costs and system performance, avoidingunnecessary expenditures on additional hardware or capacity.</p>

Those true costs are hidden, and while insurance plays an important role in risk sharing, the current system too often incentivizes price inflation by insurers acting as a middleman. But efforts to curtail unexpected and unfair medical bills, like the No Surprises Act (NSA), have faced significant pushback. Pricing must be grounded in economic fact and a reasonable rate of margin, rather than an endless hunger for profit.

Republicans ruled out cuts to Medicare, the health insurance programme for senior citizens, which leaders cut at their political peril. “We are a long way from final legislation, so it's not possible to predict how much any programme will be cut,” he said.

And the one Republican to vote against the bill, far right Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, is being threatened by Trump and his allies with a possible primary challenge next year when he's up for re-election. After months of failure, they've learned nothing and doubled down on their embarrassing dysfunction." And House Democratic Caucus Chair Rep. Pete Aguilar of California took aim at what he called a "partisan" measure and emphasized that "we put up a strong vote in opposition of this bill because this hurts families."

Yanina Maradona, daughter of late soccer star Diego Maradona, sits in court on the first day of a trial for alleged homicide by negligence against the medical team that treated her father, in San Isidro on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, Argentina, Tuesday, March 11, 2025. Dalma and Yanina Maradona, daughters of late soccer star Diego Maradona, arrive at court on the first day of a trial for homicide by negligence against the medical team that treated their father, in San Isidro on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, Argentina, Tuesday, March 11, 2025. Prosecutor Patricio Ferrari said he will provide evidence that, between Nov. 11-25 2020, Maradona was taken to a house in a private neighborhood in the town of Tigre, on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, without being in “full use of his mental faculties” to decide on home hospitalization. The trial could last up to four months and there will be three hearings per week. He performed surgery to remove a blood clot from the former footballer's brain just weeks before his death.</p>
