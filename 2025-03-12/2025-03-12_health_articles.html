Cutting Medicaid funding and halting the program's expansion would result in providers revenues decreasing by about $80 billion, and uncompensated care on behalf of uninsured people would increase by $18.9 billion in 2026 due to declines in health insurance coverage, finds a report from the Urban Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Among all provider types, hospitals would face the largest revenue losses ($31.9 billion) and burden of uncompensated care increases ($6.3 billion).

About 10.8 million more people would become uninsured if all states were to drop the Medicaid expansion, with the number of uninsured increasing by 50% or more in half of expansion states, data showed.

"With significant cuts to the Medicaid program potentially on the horizon, it is important that federal, state and local policymakers and stakeholders consider potential adverse effects on healthcare coverage, access, and affordability, and the financial vulnerability of certain providers," authors wrote.

WHAT'S THE IMPACT

Currently, the federal government pays 90% of costs for Medicaid enrollees who are eligible under the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion in all 41 states that chose to expand eligibility (including Washington D.C.). 

But House GOP leadership has proposed substantial cuts in federal funding to Medicaid over the next 10 years, potentially including per capita caps, work requirements and a reduction of the 90% match rate (known as the enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, or FMAP) for the ACA expansion population to each state's general matching rate, which varies by state from 50 to 74%.

The study cited evidence that Medicaid expansion contributed to significant gains in health insurance coverage, and improvements in access to care and low-income families' health and financial well-being, and has had a positive impact on hospitals' and other providers' financial health. That, authors said, is due to declines in providers' uncompensated care burdens – that is, reductions in unreimbursed expenses attributable to uninsured patients and increases in revenue from newly covered patients.

The declines in provider revenue resulting from the GOP's proposed cuts are around four times larger than the estimated losses that providers would face if enhanced ACA tax credits were to expire, numbers showed. 

Because lower spending on healthcare services means lower revenue for providers and fewer services rendered, the resulting decline in revenue could have adverse consequences, particularly for hospitals that are already financially at risk, authors said.

Losses in revenue from states dropping the Medicaid expansion could put more hospitals at risk and potentially lead to large increases in rural hospital closures, the report found. In addition to having negative spillover effects on the local economy, hospital closures could reduce access to and use of hospital services, increasing the mortality risk for heart attacks, unintentional injuries and time-sensitive conditions.

THE LARGER TREND

This week the Congressional Budget Office projected that the GOP's proposed $880 billion in spending cuts would not be possible without slashing Medicaid.

CBO's baseline budget projections show mandatory outlays for Medicaid, Medicare and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) will total $8.8 trillion between 2025 and 2034. Medicaid accounts for 93% of the total, at $8.2 trillion.

Medicaid expansion enrollment increased last year due to seven states implementing expansion in 2020 or later, as well as adoption of the continuous enrollment provision, a pandemic-era policy that prohibited states from disenrolling people from Medicaid in exchange for enhanced federal funding, a January KFF study found.

Even with the unwinding of the continuous enrollment provision starting April 1, 2023, enrollment in Medicaid expansion today is higher than it was in 2020, KFF found. The number of marketplace enrollees increased by 10 million people nationally, almost doubling between 2020 and 2024, and the number of Medicaid expansion enrollees increased by 6.2 million people.

Lowering the Medicaid expansion match rate from the current 90% rate would shift costs to states and likely result in decisions by many states to terminate coverage, according to KFF. About 4.3 million Medicaid expansion enrollees live in states with some type of trigger law that would end Medicaid expansion or require review of expansion coverage to mitigate increases in state costs if federal funding for the expansion is reduced.

Except for Florida, the states with the largest ACA enrollment as a share of population had adopted the Medicaid expansion. The five states with the lowest share of enrollment were Medicaid non-expansion states.

Author(s):

Flood exposure was more strongly associated with increased health care use and cost during the summer months and among Medicare beneficiaries aged 85 or older.

Flood exposure was associated with increased health care use and costs among Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 or older, emphasizing the need for targeted public health strategies and improved disaster preparedness.1



The authors of the JAMA Network Open study explained that extreme precipitation events have become more frequent and intense over the past century and are expected to increase further due to climate change. They noted that flooding impacts health in various ways, including drowning, electrical injuries, and hypothermia. Additionally, flooding-related infrastructure damage can disrupt health services, displace individuals, and create broader societal challenges.



Older adults may be particularly vulnerable to flooding-related health effects due to preexisting health conditions and mobility limitations, which can hinder their ability to respond to flood warnings or evacuations. This vulnerability is not unique to flooding, as most of the residents confirmed to have died during the California wildfires in January were either aged 65 or older or had a physical disability, underscoring the challenges of evacuation for these populations.2



Floods rank among the costliest disasters in the US, with many causing more than $1 billion in damages.1 Despite this, the researchers highlighted a lack of understanding regarding the effects of flooding on health care utilization and associated costs, which limits health impact assessments, risk communication, climate change-related damage estimation, and future projections of climate change health impacts.

To address these gaps, they analyzed the relationship between large-scale flood events and health care use among Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 or older residing in zip code tabulation areas (ZCTAs) affected by such events between 2008 and 2017. More specifically, they examined the incidence of emergency department (ED) visits and hospital admissions during flooding events and assessed the associated health care costs.



The primary exposure variable was the presence of a flood, as recorded in the Multisourced Flood Inventories, a spatially distributed flood database. Also, the primary outcomes measured included incident rate ratios (IRRs) with corresponding 95% CIs.



To quantify the impact, the researchers calculated attributable risk percentages and estimated the number of related excess visits. Additionally, they conducted stratified analyses to assess potential effect modification. As for health care costs, the researchers standardized all estimates to 2017 US dollars to ensure comparability.



The study population contained 11,801,527 Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 or older, with a mean (SD) age of 74.4 (7.6) years. Most beneficiaries were female (56.3%) and White (88.3%). From 2008 through 2017, the researchers determined that 16,536 of 33,140 ZCTAs flooded. The median number of floods experienced in each ZCTA was 1 (IQR, 1-2), and the median flood duration was 10 (IQR, 4-30) days.



The mean (SD) ZCTA flood exposure per beneficiary was 1.3 (0.6). Also, the median area flooded was 34,769 (IQR, 17,319-65,584) square miles, and the median number of Medicare beneficiaries per flooded ZCTA was 4142 (IQR, 2006-7536).



The rate of all-cause ED visits and hospitalizations increased by 4.8% (IRR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.04-1.05) and 7.4% (IRR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.07-1.08), respectively, after flood exposure. The researchers observed the largest IRR increases for ED visits among beneficiaries with metabolic and kidney conditions (IRR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.06-1.11) and injuries (IRR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.04-1.06). Similarly, they observed the greatest IRR increases for all-cause hospitalizations among beneficiaries with infectious disease (IRR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.10-1.13) and metabolic and kidney conditions (IRR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.07-1.12).



Additionally, stratified analyses determined that the IRRs increased with age, from 4.9% greater hospitalizations among adults aged 65 to 74 (IRR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.04-1.06) to 7.3% higher among those aged 75 to 84 (IRR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.06-1.08) and 12.4% greater among those aged 85 or older (IRR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.11-1.1). They also found increased IRRs for ED visits (IRR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.06-1.10) and hospitalizations (IRR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.10-1.13) in the summer months.



Lastly, the mean ZCTA-level cost was $3230 (95% CI, $3198-$32,610) per ED visit and $11,310 (95% CI, $11,252-$11,367) for all-cause hospitalizations. Consequently, the national costs to the Medicare system for ED visits and hospitalizations were estimated to be $69,275,429 (95% CI, $63,010,840-$76,315,210) and $191,409,579 (95% CI, $172,782,870-$206,181,300), respectively.



The researchers acknowledged their study's limitations, including the health care cost estimations using claims data from the Medicare dataset; this approach may not capture the total health care costs resulting from flood exposure. Despite their limitations, they expressed confidence in their findings and suggested areas for further research.



“Although our findings provided valuable insights to the understanding of flood-related health impacts, they also highlighted the need for ongoing research in this area, especially in the context of an aging population and a changing climate,” the authors concluded. “Future studies should aim to incorporate more detailed environmental and individual-level data to further refine our understanding of the complex interplay between flood events and population health.”

If states end their expansion programs, spending on healthcare services would fall by nearly $80 billion and uncompensated care costs would rise by nearly $19 billion in 2026.

Congressional Republicans are debating slashing funds for Medicaid to pay for President Donald Trump's promised tax cuts, as well as increased spending on defense and border security.

Last month, House Republicans advanced a budget blueprint that directs the Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicare and Medicaid, to find $880 in spending cuts.

The budget resolution doesn't specifically mention Medicaid. But Republicans are unlikely to meet their budget targets without slashing the safety-net insurance, which covers almost 80 million Americans along with the Children's Health Insurance Program, according to a letter sent to lawmakers from the Congressional Budget Office last week. 

One potential way to lower Medicaid spending is reducing the amount of money the federal government provides states to cover the cost of expanding the program to more beneficiaries. 

Under the Affordable Care Act, the government pays 90% of the expenses for enrollees who are eligible for Medicaid under expansion — typically working people who can't afford or aren't offered coverage through their jobs, according to the report. 

Slashing those funds would put significant pressure on their budgets, the Urban Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation said in a previous analysis. If all states that have expanded Medicaid drop their programs, the number of uninsured, non-elderly adults would increase by nearly 11 million.

The healthcare sector would also likely see reduced revenue, as uninsured people seek out less medical care. Nearly $21 billion less would be spent on prescription drugs, while services provided by office-based physicians would decline by $6.4 billion, according to the report. Other healthcare services, like home healthcare or dental care, would also fall by nearly $21 billion.

“A funding reduction of this magnitude would not only cause a massive coverage loss but would also be financially devastating for hospitals and other healthcare providers,” Katherine Hempstead, senior policy adviser at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, said in a statement. “Hospitals are major employers and are often the economic bedrock of their communities. These cuts would have major ripple effects on local economies, especially in rural areas.”

Providers would also take a financial hit from an increased burden of services that aren't reimbursed. Uncompensated care would increase by $2.2 billion for physician practices and $6.6 billion for other healthcare services, as well as a $3.8 billion bump in uncompensated spending on prescription drugs.

More than half of the increase in uncompensated care will be financed by providers themselves, according to the analysis. Thirty percent would come from the federal government, while 19% would be financed by state and local governments.

Resident and intern physicians at Hennepin Healthcare filed for union recognition on Wednesday in hopes of improving pay and working conditions for professionals getting their start in the medical field.

A supermajority of more than 200 residents and interns voted in favor of securing collective bargaining rights with the Committee of Interns and Residents, an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union with more than 37,000 members nationwide. 

The doctors say they work up to 80 hours per week for what “amounts to as little as minimum wage per hour,” according to a news release from CIR/SEIU. 

“[H]ospital administration basically uses residents to plug holes in an understaffed system,” Dr. Abishek Thatigutla said. “It's simply not sustainable to keep pushing ourselves this much, and we're unionizing not only to address our conditions but hopefully to improve the system itself.” 

In addition to dissatisfaction with hours and wages, union members specifically cited difficulty for staff who are pregnant or have children.

“One thing that has motivated me to want to unionize and ensure we have a collective voice is that there just isn't a whole lot of support for parents, and especially for pregnant physicians,” one CIR/SEIU member, Dr. Nicole Lund, said. “I want to leave this place better than I found it, and part of that is bringing in a more diverse resident body, which includes women and women having children.”

They've asked Hennepin Healthcare to voluntarily recognize their union.

TAMPA, Fla. — There is no denying that artificial intelligence has crept into nearly every aspect of our lives at a breakneck pace. It was only a matter of time before AI made it to healthcare. Many doctors, politicians, and experts are asking how AI will be used. 

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE EXAM ROOM

"The difference with ambient AI is it's actually more close to an intelligent human scribe," Dr. Nishit Patel, Vice President and Chief Medical Informatics Officer at Tampa General Hospital, said.

Last year, TGH launched new AI-powered software called Ambient Listening. More than 500 doctors are participating in the program. The doctor simply sets the phone down to record the conversation (with patient approval), and the software transcribes it in seconds.

Doctors can spend on average 4.5 hours per day working on paperwork or electronic documentation. Dr. Patel said this saves time while capturing precise medical information gathered during the appointment.

"These tools help us get through the massive amounts of unstructured paperwork and data we have that insurance companies are trying to go through to figure out if this is an appropriate authorization. And, so I think hopefully if we use these tools in the optimal ethical way to do the right thing for the patient, we all win," Dr. Patel said. "What I fear, though, is that if a payer or a health system is trying to use these tools to sort of win a battle, what we end up in is much more of an AI arms race, where, frankly, nobody really wins. And so I think these tools have the opportunity for us to get authorizations more timely."

Pre-authorizations and peer-to-peer reviews have come under scrutiny as doctors and medical professionals are speaking out about dealing with health insurance companies.

ABC Action News reporter Michael Paluska recently reported on those doctors for the ongoing series, "Patient No More.”

INSURANCE DENIALS USING AI

"Are insurance companies using AI to really kick out and deny batch claims by the hundreds or maybe thousands at one moment?" Paluska asked Dr. John Licato, Associate Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department.

"What I can say is that the technology to do it is definitely there, and the technology to auto-reject a claim is not necessarily even that sophisticated," Licato said. "There are lawsuits going on that accuse insurance companies of doing things like that, but, you know, it's impossible to know for sure what they're actually doing. That's going to come out in the trials, hopefully."

"If AI is rejecting claims, then the patient will probably have to use AI to fight the claims because the AI is so good, a human won't be able to beat it?" Paluska asked.

"Yeah, and that is exactly an example of the kind of arms race that we're anticipating," Licato said.

"AI will have a really big part in whether or not your care goes through?" Paluska asked.

"Yeah," Licato said.

"So something gets denied, like a claim. I guess it's going to be on the doctors now to figure it out and get their patients covered until AI is being used in a way where it's balanced?" Paluska asked.

"I'm skeptical that that balance will ever be found, though. I think it's just going to be a continuing arms race. You know, maybe you'll reach a temporary equilibrium, but some breakthrough is going to happen," Licato said.

States are trying to get ahead of the technology. Several across the country are passing laws to make sure a human reviews any claims rejected by AI.

Florida State Senator Jennifer Bradley filed SB794 this legislative session.

According to the bill:

"My initial reaction to that is, I'm not sure how you'd enforce that, right? You know, you say, okay, a human has to review this. What is to stop them from just saying, 'Yeah, I looked it over.' Then you see this text that was generated here. 'I read that. It looks okay to me.' I don't know how you'd enforce that."

Dr. Ronald Rodriguez holds a unique title in healthcare. He's professor of medical education and program director of the nation's first MD/MS in Artificial Intelligence dual degree at The University of Texas at San Antonio. The five-year dual degree was launched in 2023.

Rodriguez, who also holds a doctorate in cellular biology, is at the forefront of AI's transformation of healthcare. He is well aware of all the positive ways AI and automation are benefiting healthcare already. But he also sees some aspects of the technology that should give pause to clinicians and IT executives.

This is part one of a two-part interview with Rodriguez. Here he points out matters of AI in healthcare that require great care by professionals – even places where he believes professionals are getting it wrong. Part two, coming soon, will be in video format and discuss the doctor's groundbreaking work in healthcare AI education.

Q. What are some clinicians potentially doing wrong today with generative AI tools, and how can hospital and health system CIOs and other IT and privacy leaders do to make sure generative AI, today, is used correctly?

A. They are not protecting protected health information effectively. Many of the commercial large language model servers take the prompts and data uploaded to their servers and use it for further training later. In many cases, providers are cutting and pasting aggregate clinical data and asking the large language model to reorganize, summarize and provide an assessment.

Unfortunately, many times the patient's PHI is contained in the lab reports, image reports or prior notes in ways that might not be readily apparent to the provider. Failure to eliminate the PHI is a tier 2 HIPAA violation. Each offense could potentially result in a separate fine. IT providers are able to tell when PHI is being cut and pasted and can warn users not to do it. Often this is already happening.

However, currently most of these systems are not enforcing compliance with these rules at the individual level. CIOs and technology leaders at hospitals and health systems can develop PHI removal tools that protect against these violations. Many of the LLM providers allow settings that prevent data sharing; however, enforcement of those settings is at the provider's discretion and not ensured.

Q. You say: "Our current business model of AI use is an ecosystem where each prompt generates a cost based on the number of tokens. This incremental cost currently is modeled such that it is more likely to actually increase healthcare costs than reduce them." Please explain what you mean by using a clear example that shows how costs go up.

A. Let's take DAX and Abridge, which are systems that take a recording of the patient-provider interaction, transcribe the interaction and summarize it for use in a note. The costs of these systems is based on actual usage.

The systems make life much easier for physicians, but there is no way to bill the patient for these extra costs through third-party payers. Instead, the only current option to pay for these incremental costs is for the providers to see more patients. Seeing more patients means third-party providers will see more claims, which ultimately will be reflected in higher premiums or lower benefits or both.

Other systems that automate answering patient questions using LLMs may provide immediate feedback to patients with simple questions but also comes at a cost which is incremental. Those costs currently also are not billable, and hence the result is pressure to see more patients.

Let's consider a hospital system implementing one of these generative AI tools to assist physicians with clinical documentation. A single physician might interact with the AI engine multiple times per patient visit.

Now, multiply this across hundreds or thousands of physicians within a health system working across multiple shifts, and the cumulative cost of AI usage quickly skyrockets. Even if AI improves documentation efficiency, the operational expense of frequent AI queries may offset or even exceed the savings from reduced administrative work.

So far, AI usage models are pay-per-use and are not like traditional software with fixed licensing fees. So, the more an organization integrates AI into daily workflows, the higher the financial burden becomes.

Unless hospitals and healthcare providers negotiate cost-effective pricing structures, implement usage controls or develop in-house AI systems, they may find themselves in a situation where AI adoption leads to escalating operational costs rather than the anticipated savings.

Q. You told me: "Safeguards need to be put in place before we will ever realize a true improvement in our overall medical errors. Over-reliance on AI to correct mistakes could potentially result in different types of errors." Please elaborate on the problem, and please discuss the needed safeguards, in your opinion.

A. LLMs are prone to hallucinations under certain situations. While some providers are very good at avoiding those situations – we actually teach our students how to avoid such situations – many are not aware. A new source of medical errors can be introduced if these errors are not caught. One way to safeguard against this is to use agentic specialty-specific AI LLMs.

These systems perform double checks on the information, confirm its veracity and use sophisticated methods to minimize errors. However, such systems are not built into the off-the-shelf LLMs like ChatGPT or Claud AI. They will cost more to use, and they will require a larger investment in infrastructure.

Investment in the infrastructure to protect privacy, prevent unintended sharing of PHI, and protect against predictable LLMs and misconceptions rampant in the internet data scraping used for pretraining of the foundational LLMs, will be required. Policies to enforce compliance will also be necessary.

Q. How should hospitals and health systems go about developing proper ethical policies, guidelines and oversight?

A. As AI technologies rapidly advance, major medical organizations need to provide guidance documents, and boilerplate policies that can help institutions adopt best practices. This can be accomplished at several levels.

Participation in oversight organizations and medical groups like the AMA, AAMC and governmental oversight committees can help solidify a common framework for ethical AI data access and use policies.

The prospect of deep Medicaid cuts has become a flashpoint in Congress, with leaders of both parties accusing their counterparts of lying.

House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said Feb. 27 that a Republican budget measure would "set in motion the largest cut to Medicaid in American history," and Republicans are hiding the consequences.

"The Republicans are lying to the American people about Medicaid," Jeffries said. "I can't say it any other way. Republicans are lying. Prove me wrong."

Republicans said Democrats were distorting the Republican budget. Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., said, "The word Medicaid is not even in this bill."

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said on CNN that Republicans don't want to cut Medicaid, "and the Democrats have been lying about it."

Republicans are looking for massive budget savings to meet their goal of fully extending President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts. This is a separate process from Congress' need to pass a continuing resolution to keep the government running by March 14 or else face a federal government shutdown.

Here's what we know so far about potential Medicaid cuts.

Medicaid serves about one in five Americans. The health care program for low-income people is paid for by the federal government and partly by states. Louisiana, home to Johnson and Scalise, has one of the highest state proportions of Medicaid enrollees.

The House Republican budget plan adopted Feb. 25 opens the door to slashing Medicaid, even though it doesn't name the program.

The plan directs the House Energy and Commerce Committee to find ways to cut the deficit by at least $880 billion over the next decade.

The committee has jurisdiction over Medicaid, Medicare and the Children's Health Insurance Program, in addition to much smaller programs. CHIP offers low-cost health coverage to children in families that earn too much money to qualify for Medicaid.

Republicans ruled out cuts to Medicare, the health insurance program for seniors that leaders cut at their political peril. Medicare is about 15% of the federal budget, and Medicaid is about 8.6%.

When Medicare is set aside, Medicaid accounts for 93% of the funding under the committee's jurisdiction, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found in a March 5 analysis. That means it is impossible for the committee to find enough cuts that don't affect Medicaid.

"It's a fantasy to imply that federal Medicaid assistance won't be cut very deeply," said Allison Orris, an expert on Medicaid policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank.

After Medicaid, the next largest program under the committee's jurisdiction is CHIP. Lawmakers don't appear to be planning to wipe out CHIP, but even if they did, they would only be a "fraction of the way there," said Joan Alker, an expert on Medicaid and CHIP at Georgetown University.

If Medicare cuts are off the table, the only way to achieve $880 billion in savings is through big Medicaid cuts, said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, a health policy organization.

Andy Schneider, a professor at Georgetown who served in the Obama administration as a senior adviser at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said even if the committee eliminated all of those "other" programs entirely it could only achieve $381 billion in savings — about 43% of the target.

"In short, if they don't want to cut Medicaid (or CHIP), and they don't want to cut Medicare, the goal of cutting $880 billion is impossible," Schneider said.

The $880 billion cut is not a done deal. House Republicans were able to pass their budget package, but Senate Republicans are taking a different approach, without proposing such significant cuts.

Any finalized budget blueprint would need Senate Republicans' buy-in. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., is among Republicans who have spoken against potential cuts; he told HuffPost, "I would not do severe cuts to Medicaid."

The numbers are starting points that may lead to negotiation among at least Republicans, Joe Antos, a health care expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said. "We are a long way from final legislation, so it's not possible to predict how much any program will be cut," he said.

"If the bill also includes extending the (Trump 2017) tax cuts, we are probably months away from seeing real language," Antos said.

Once the House and Senate have reached an agreement on language and the resolution passes both chambers, the committees will work on detailed cuts. To enact such cuts, both chambers would need to approve a separate bill and receive Trump's signature.

Republican leaders have deflected concerns about Medicaid cuts by talking about a different target: Medicaid fraud.

"I'm not going to touch Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. Now, we're going to get fraud out of there," Trump told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on March 9, in keeping with his campaign rhetoric that he would protect those programs.

At the same time, Trump praised the House resolution that would make cuts highly likely: "The House Resolution implements my FULL America First Agenda, EVERYTHING, not just parts of it!"

Would eliminating fraud solve the Medicaid problem? No.

On CNN, Johnson said cutting fraud, waste and abuse would result in "part of the savings to accomplish this mission." He said the government loses $50 billion a year in Medicaid payments "just in fraud alone."

Johnson conflated "fraud" with "improper payments." The Government Accountability Office, the nonpartisan investigative arm that examines the use of public funds, found about $50 billion in improper payments in Medicaid and the same amount in Medicare in 2023.

Those improper payments were made in an incorrect amount (overpayment or underpayment), should not have been made at all, or had missing or insufficient documentation. But that doesn't mean that there was $50 billion in Medicaid fraud, which would involve obtaining something through willful misrepresentation.

The system used to identify improper payments is not designed to measure fraud, so we don't know what percentage of improper payments were losses due to fraud, said Schneider, the former Obama administration health adviser.

Plus, it's a drop in the overall bucket of the potential $880 billion in cuts.

I asked if I could purchase the brace myself and bring it to the surgery. The answer was an unequivocal no: the health insurer's contracted rate required me to purchase the brace from the hospital as part of the procedure.

Recently, I had a routine surgery to repair a torn meniscus in my right knee. This was a relatively simple procedure that many Americans need each year, the kind of thing that you would hope would come with no surprises. Instead, what I received was a firsthand look at ways that healthcare in the United States is often designed to drive up costs in pursuit of profit. 

The day before my surgery, I was told that I would have to wear a specialized knee brace following my procedure. The brace would cost $3,300, a hefty price, though only 10% would come out of my own pocket. But as someone who has been in the healthcare space for over a decade, I've learned when to be skeptical about the costs of medical procedures and equipment. 

So, out of curiosity, I researched the make and model of the brace that would be placed on my knee in the operating room. I learned it wasn't a special brace at all. In fact, the same brace could be readily found on sites like Amazon for as little as $150. 


					Balancing healthcare benefits and insurance costs requires research. From becoming a Difference Card member to offering wellness resources, there are many ways to improve healthcare at low cost.				

I asked if I could purchase the brace myself and bring it to the surgery. The answer was an unequivocal no: the health insurer's contracted rate required me to purchase the brace from the hospital as part of the procedure. The exact brace — at 22 times the cost I could buy it from an online retailer — was part of the surgical bundle with my insurance network.An estimated 750,000 knee arthroscopies are performed annually in the United States. If my experience is representative, that means we're paying $2 billion for these braces each year alone. 

Follow the money 

The reason for this experience is as simple as it is disheartening: price gouging and intentional obfuscation have unfortunately become essential ingredients in an industry focused more on maximizing profits than on creating a sustainable and affordable health system. 

To those of us with insurance coverage, some of this may be invisible – a reasonable $20 copay can obscure the potentially thousands of dollars that make up the total cost paid and provides no information on if that was a reasonable price to pay for that drug or service. Those true costs are hidden, and while insurance plays an important role in risk sharing, the current system too often incentivizes price inflation by insurers acting as a middleman.

There is another way. Third-party administrators (TPAs) make money administering health benefit plans on behalf of employers. They charge employers a straightforward monthly service fee, and they don't monetize members visiting the doctor, filling a prescription, or going out of network. In other words, their business model incentivizes them to help people find and access the appropriate care for their needs, not to profit unnecessarily from it. 

Health insurance companies offer administrative-only services as well, but often those services are neither visible nor easy to unravel for health plan members or the companies that contract with them.

For example, when someone receives care from a provider that is not within their health insurance company's network, they are usually met with a higher billed rate. In that case, the health insurance company will offer to negotiate a lower rate and in return, the insurer typically keeps the majority of the difference between the initial amount that was billed by the doctor or facility and the final “allowed” amount they negotiated. It's euphemistically called a “shared savings” arrangement. 

But in reality, there should be no need to have to negotiate a different rate with a physician or facility based on whether it is contracted with an insurance network or not. Just like there should be no difference between the cost of a knee brace depending on whether I buy it on Amazon or get it from the surgeon or hospital. 

Guidance for providers 

Systemic change moves at a glacial pace. But providers, individual members, and benefits leaders can take steps to chip away at the oligopoly. And the first step is transparency. 

For instance, if hospitals were required by law to publish wholesale and retail price lists, consumers would garner a better understanding of the actual acquired costs of drugs and services, compared to what's being passed along to them or to enterprise customers. While hospitals are required to share standard changes, negotiated rates with insurance companies, and discounted cash prices, wholesale prices are still largely kept under wraps. 

But efforts to curtail unexpected and unfair medical bills, like the No Surprises Act (NSA), have faced significant pushback. Widespread adoption of the NSA has been slow to roll out due to litigation from hospitals and insurance companies worried about their bottom lines. 

In the interim, the price data that is being furnished is largely unhelpful. This so-called data consists of jumbled codes that even the most well-versed data scientists have struggled to untangle. 

Guidance for members 

As patients, much of the onus is unfortunately on us to dig into why we're paying what we're paying. The best thing we can do is develop staunch curiosity about every medical bill that comes our way. 

If you're going to be charged for a piece of equipment like a knee brace, do your research like I did. See if alternatives exist at a lower price online. Ask your healthcare providers if you can bring in your own equipment. If they say no, demand to know why. You deserve to know why.

Odds are, they'll tell you it's between you and your insurance company. It's then incumbent on us to ask insurance providers what things will cost. If they aren't willing to tell you, then it's time to bring that information to your employer's HR or benefits team. 

Guidance for employers and benefits leaders 

Once made aware of unfair pricing, benefits leaders should confront their insurance providers directly. Ask them how they make money from your health benefit plan. Be prepared to encounter that veil of complexity and vagueness again. But at least you'll know you've done your due diligence. 

My biggest recommendation for employers struggling to navigate the world of healthcare plans is to work with an independent entity that has no perverse incentive to inflate the price of care. Employers can look by system, geography, or provider to see what providers are charging, and they can analyze distribution to ascertain whether pricing is fair or within a reasonable set of boundaries. 

At the benefit design level, employers can work with third parties to redirect members to providers that don't behave egregiously. If enough people are redirected, then this will force centers to bring pricing in line. 

We can fix US healthcare by asking basic questions

My story is not a unique one, but rather a reflection of how the health insurance oligopoly abuses the average American patient. When I shared this story with my peers, many seemed to have had a similar experience. We spend around twice as much on healthcare as other industrialized nations, and as of February 2024, Americans collectively owe at least $220 billion in medical debt. 

This cannot continue. Pricing must be grounded in economic fact and a reasonable rate of margin, rather than an endless hunger for profit. The best weapon we have against unethical pricing practices is curiosity — our willingness to peel back the veil of obfuscation. The more people ask questions, the more they'll create a groundswell of change. 

And if we pull on the thread of that veil enough, it will unravel.

Less than two months ago, 52-year-old Oklahoma State Representative Melissa Provenzano underwent a mastectomy for stage one HER2-positive breast cancer. 

Less than two months ago, 52-year-old Oklahoma State Representative Melissa Provenzano underwent a mastectomy for stage one HER2-positive breast cancer.

"Luckily, the prognosis is good because I caught it so early. Mine was less than a centimeter," said Provenzano.

She said since her mother's breast cancer diagnosis 10 years ago, she doesn't skip mammograms.

"I usually get them in September or October, but I pushed it back to the very beginning of November because of campaign season," said Provenzano.

Her mother was in the clear for a decade, then at 72-years-old, the cancer came back. In November, her mom had a mastectomy.

"Then I got my mammogram and they're like well we need you to come in. She had her surgery in November and then in December I was diagnosed and I was like are you kidding. Then I got my mammogram and they're like well we need you to come in and by December 11th, I had been diagnosed with a different type of breast cancer than my mother," said Provenzano.

In 2022 Provenzano's legislation, House Bill 3504, forced health insurance companies to cover follow up tests, like MRIs and ultrasounds, once a mammogram spots an abnormality.

"Such common sense things that you don't think about until you're in it. It looks so different now it's like oh I understand exactly why this is such a deal," said Provenzano.

Before Provenzano fought to get those diagnostic tests covered, women were being forced to make tough choices.

"So back in 2022, I had a woman reach out to me and say so the price is depending on your insurance, anywhere $400 and $1,200 and I have to put food on the table. I'm a single mom, what are we doing," said Provenzano.

When the governor signed House Bill 3504, Oklahoma became the 10th state to pass legislation requiring insurance to cover further tests when a mammogram shows an abnormality.

"I cant tell you how many women have reached out to me to say you know, either thank you because wow I actually got a check back the first year it passed, because I'd already paid for it and my insurance company refunded the money. The Komen Foundation actually came out and said it's actually saving millions of dollars across the state for women," said Provenzano.

Now, 27 other states have similar laws. While she's fighting breast cancer, Provenzano is also fighting to pass House Bill 1389, which clarifies the language about exactly which tests health insurance must pay for.

"We're also finding that depending on where you live in the state of Oklahoma, the machine available to you might be different, so we want to capture all of those things under this umbrella. This leaves that in 2022. This leaves the decision as to what you need best between you and your doctor," said Provenzano.

She said her oncologist is working around her crazy schedule at the Capitol. On Fridays, she's back in Tulsa and that's when she goes for chemotherapy.

Provenzano tested negative for the BRCA gene that her mother carries. Her sister plans to get tested, just weeks before her own diagnosis and one week before their mother's mastectomy. She and her sister got matching tattoos.

"We got this in honor of my mother," said Provenzano.

She says she doesn't know anyone who hasn't had a friend or loved one fight breast cancer, it crosses party lines.

"Republicans, Democrats, just kind of gathering around you and offering support and what is it that we need and how can we support you," said Provenzano.

At last month's Pink Stilleto Gala, the Susan G. Komen Foundation named Provenzano the 2025 Woman of Inspiration. An honor that's very special, but she's not doing this work for accolades.

"This one thing can save a life. If I can save one life. I feel pretty lucky," said Provenzano.

House Bill 1389 had bipartisan support. FOX23 will keep tabs on it and let you know if it reaches the governor's desk.

The Texas-based home-based care provider New Day Healthcare has acquired the home health agency Patient Recovery Home Healthcare Services in Houston. Financial terms were undisclosed.

The transaction marks New Day's 14th successful acquisition to date and comes approximately one month after it acquired Christian Senior Care, also in Houston. Patient Recovery Home Healthcare has been in operation for 15 years and will not rebrand post-acquisition. The company's current staff will remain in place, according to New Day.

“New Day is pleased to welcome Patient Recovery Home Healthcare to our expanding home care platform,” said Matthew Griffith, chief development and strategy officer for New Day, in a statement. “Patient Recovery Home Healthcare, along with Christian Senior Care Services which we acquired earlier this year, provide New Day with needed density, brand recognition and talent to grow in an ultra-competitive Houston market.”

New Day now provides the full continuum of its home care services to patients in the Houston area and views the market as critical to its long-term growth strategy, the company indicated in a press release. It is pursuing additional growth in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, San Antonio and Austin, Texas.

Similar to national demographic trends, a growing aging population is driving demand for hospice in Texas. Seniors 65 and older represent 13.8% of the Lone Star State's overall population, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Hospice utilization among Medicare decedents 52.23% in Texas in 2022, reported the National Alliance for Care at Home. Hospice utilization rates hovered at 49.1% nationwide that year.

New Day Healthcare provides hospice, home heath, pediatrics, clinical decision support and personal care to more than 150,000 patients annually from 33 locations across Texas, Missouri, Kansas and Illinois. 

“New Day's value creation model is based on providing the continuum of services while leveraging our proprietary CareLytics software to best monitor patients and to fill care gaps,” said Griffith. “The Houston metro area, along with Dallas-Fort Worth, San Antonio and Austin, provide the needed density and growth potential to align our clinical care models and improve patient outcomes.”

Death rates from breast cancer will fall in 2025 in every age group in the EU and the UK apart from in EU patients aged 80 years and older. In these older patients, overall mortality rates from the disease are predicted to rise by nearly 10% in 2025.

However, in the UK, breast cancer death rates are expected to decrease by 7% in this age group, compared to rates observed between 2015-2019. In Spain, there is also a 4% decrease in patients aged 80 and over.

These findings are from a new study published in the leading cancer journal Annals of Oncology today (Wednesday), which predicts death rates from cancer in the EU and UK for 2025.

Researchers led by Carlo La Vecchia (MD), Professor of Medical Statistics and Epidemiology at the University of Milan (Italy), suspect that the reason why death rates from breast cancer are increasing in older patients in the EU is because women aged 80 and older are not screened regularly for breast cancer and are less likely to receive the most up-to-date treatments.

Prof. La Vecchia said: "Elderly women are not covered by screening and probably are less favourably affected by the substantial advances in breast cancer management, including improvements in chemo- and hormone therapy, such as trastuzumab and related drugs, but also in radiotherapy and surgery.

"The increased prevalence of overweight and obesity over the last few decades in most of northern and central Europe has led to an increased risk of breast cancer. In the elderly, this has not been counter-balanced by improved diagnosis and management. This accounts for the increased mortality in people aged 80 and over."

Younger women aged between 20 to 49 years are usually not screened regularly either, but the experts predict death rates will fall by about 7% in this age group in the EU and by almost 15% in the UK, compared to death rates seen between 2015-2019.

Prof. La Vecchia and colleagues predict that, compared to death rates in 2020, breast cancer rates overall will fall by 4% in the EU and by 6% in the UK in 2025. The age standardised mortality rate (ASMR) in the EU will be 13.3 deaths per 100,000 of the female population (a total of 90,100 deaths) and 13.2 per 100,000 in the UK (a total of 11,400 deaths).

The rates vary by country and age group. In Germany, overall breast cancer death rates will fall by 14%, in the UK by 10%, in Poland by 9%, in France and Spain by 8%, and in Italy by 2%. Across all age groups, breast cancer death rates will fall by 7%-12% in the EU in different age groups, with the exception of women aged 80 and over where there will be an increase in the EU, apart from Spain.

"We estimate that between 1989 and 2025, 373,000 breast cancer deaths have been avoided in the EU and 197,000 in the UK. Most of these are due to improved management and therapy, but 25-30% are likely to be attributable to more widespread screening and early diagnosis," said Prof. La Vecchia.

"Given that breast cancer is now a largely curable cancer that requires modern integrated approaches, it is essential that all diagnoses of breast cancer are referred to comprehensive cancer centres, which can offer the complete range of therapies that might be required.

"As indicated by the unfavorable trends in elderly women, control of overweight and obesity is a priority now, not only for cardiovascular diseases, but also for cancer, including breast cancer."

The researchers analyzed cancer death rates in the EU 27 Member States as a whole and separately in the UK. They looked at the five most populous EU countries (France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain) and, individually, for stomach, intestines, pancreas, lung, breast, uterus (including cervix), ovary, prostate, bladder and leukemias for men and women]. Prof. La Vecchia and his colleagues collected data on deaths from the World Health Organization and United Nations databases from 1970 to 2021 for most of the EU-27 and the UK. This is the fifteenth consecutive year the researchers have published these predictions, which have proved to be reliable over the years.

In the EU-27 countries, they predict there will be a 3.5% fall in the age-standardized death rates for all cancers from 125 per 100,000 of the population in 2020 to 121 per 100,000 in 2025 for men, and a 1% fall from 80 to 79 per 100,000 among women. A total of approximately 1,280,000 people will die from the disease in the EU and 173,000 in the UK.

In the UK, the age-standardized death rate for all cancers in men will fall by 10% from 112 to 101 per 100,000, and by 6% from 87.6 to 82 per 100,000 among women in 2025.

However, due to the increasing numbers of elderly people in the population, the actual number of deaths from cancer will rise from 671,963 in 2020 to 709,400 men in the EU in 2025, and from 537,866 to 570,500 women. In the UK, the number of deaths will rise from 91,239 to 92,200 men and from 80,378 to 81,100 women.

Death rates from most cancers are predicted to fall this year in the EU, with the exception of pancreatic cancer: up 2% in men and 3% in women. In women, lung cancer is also predicted to rise by nearly 4%, and bladder cancer will rise by nearly 2%.

In the UK, the only death rates predicted to rise are those for bowel cancer in women and in the uterus (both by less than 1%). Death rates from all other cancers are falling in both sexes.

Smoking remains by far the major recognised cause of pancreatic cancer, accounting for 20 to 35% of cases in various populations and age groups, according to their different smoking habits. Diabetes, being overweight and developing the metabolic syndrome account for around 5% of pancreatic cancers in Europe. This is becoming more and more important following the increasing prevalence of obesity, but control and avoidance of smoking remains the top priority for pancreatic cancer control."

Prof. Eva Negri from the University of Bologna (Italy), co-leader of the research

Over 37 years between 1988 and 2025, the researchers calculated the number of cancer deaths avoided, assuming that rates remained constant at the 1988 rates. They estimate that a total of 6.8 million deaths from all cancers have been avoided in the EU (4,700,000 in men and 2,100,000 in women), and a total of 1,500,000 in the UK (1 million in men and 500,000 in women).

Lung cancer will kill the greatest absolute number of men in both the EU and the UK (151,000 and 16,700 respectively), and among women in the UK (15,500). In the EU, breast cancer will kill the greatest number of EU women, but the predicted death rate from lung cancer is now slightly higher than breast cancer in these women and is increasing (up 3.8%), whereas it is falling for breast cancer (down 3.6%).

Prof. La Vecchia concluded: "Trends in cancer mortality continue to be favourable across Europe. However, there are a few negative indications. These include deaths from bowel cancer in people younger than 50, which have started to increase in the UK and several central and northern Europe countries, mainly due to increased prevalence of overweight and obesity in the young who are not covered by colorectal cancer screening.

"In addition, death rates from pancreatic cancer are not decreasing in the EU, and it is now the fourth cause of cancer death in Europe after lung, colorectal and breast cancer. Death rates from lung cancer are starting to level off but not yet to decrease in EU women. The trends in pancreatic and female lung cancer underline the urgency of implementing stricter tobacco control across Europe."

A federal judge blocked Donald Trump's executive order banning trans youth healthcare, but access remains uncertain

Aryn Kavanaugh was sitting in her living room in South Carolina when her 17-year-old daughter came into the room and said: “I'm really scared. I think people are gonna die.” Katherine, who is using her middle name for her protection, told Kavanaugh that she thought transgender youth may be the target of violence due to the hate generated by Donald Trump's recent action.

On 28 January, Trump issued an executive order to ban access to gender-affirming care for youth under 19 years old. It directed federal agencies to deny funding to institutions that offer gender-affirming medical care including hormones and puberty blockers.

“She just felt like the world was crumbling around her. So we talked it out and tried to stay super positive,” said Kavanaugh, a parent of two trans children. “I think she really feels like we're on the edge of chaos.”

In a victory for trans kids and their families, a federal judge in Maryland blocked the ban on 4 March. The preliminary injunction extended a mid-February restraining order that blocked Trump's directive and will remain in effect until further order from the US district court for the district of Maryland. In the meantime, the order prohibits the government from withholding federal funding to healthcare facilities that provide treatment to trans youth.

Still, the executive order sent parents, children and medical providers into a tailspin as they deciphered its impacts. Some hospitals immediately canceled appointments and turned away new patients to adhere to the directive. In early February, Katherine was dropped as a patient at Virginia Commonwealth University, where she received gender-affirming care after South Carolina banned hormone therapy, surgery and puberty blockers for trans youth last year. Some parents say that their children's mental health severely declined in the weeks following the executive order. And as a result, families have gone to great lengths to ensure that their trans kids continue to receive care, including considering moving abroad or stocking up on puberty suppressants.

“We have seen dozens of families affected across the United States, in many, many states that have been left and abandoned without care that they need,” said Omar Gonzalez-Pagan, senior counsel and healthcare strategist at the LGBTQ+ civil rights organization Lambda Legal. “This is an unlawful executive order because it seeks to override the congressional mandate to condition federal financial assistance on non-discrimination, and this order seeks to require discrimination as a condition of federal funding.”

The pause follows a lawsuit filed on 4 February by civil rights organizations including Lambda Legal and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) on behalf of transgender youth. ACLU staff told the Guardian that they anticipated that the preliminary injunction would remain through the court proceedings.

Some hospitals that stopped providing care to trans youth after the January directive, such as Children's Hospital Los Angeles and Children's Hospital of Richmond, lifted limits on surgeries or hormonal therapy in late February. Kavanaugh said she was “relieved and hopeful” about the preliminary injunction, though it does not roll back South Carolina's ban on trans youth healthcare, which was signed into law last year.

Her 18-year-old trans son Parker and Katherine received treatment at Medical University of South Carolina and then a private clinic in the state for several years until Henry McMaster, the governor of South Carolina, signed into law a ban on gender-affirming care for trans minors in May 2024. Parker is now old enough to receive his care in South Carolina, but the state ban means that the family has had to drive more than five hours each way to Virginia Commonwealth University for Katherine's doctors' appointments and medicine every few months.

Being dropped as a patient due to the federal ban “puts us in a really tough spot because we're already having to find care outside of South Carolina. And so that just limits our options,” Kavanaugh said. Katherine's doctors connected her to a private medical practice in Fairfax, Virginia, that does not receive federal funding, so they were able to avoid a lapse in her care. While the change in providers did not cost more money, it stretched their commute to more than seven hours.

In late February, Katherine's puberty-blocker treatment at Virginia Commonwealth University resumed. In a statement, the hospital said that patients would continue medications, but that surgeries would remain suspended. Trans kids' treatment remains in limbo as federal challenges wind through the court.

Studies have shown that gender-affirming medical care greatly improves trans people's mental health and quality of life. A 2022 report published in the journal JAMA Network Open analyzed data from a study of 104 transgender and non-binary youth from ages 13 to 20 who received hormonal therapy or puberty blockers at the Seattle Children's Gender Clinic for a year. Researchers found that 60% of participants reported lower rates of depression and 73% had less odds of suicidal ideation and self harm after receiving gender-affirming hormones and puberty blockers.

Black transgender people, who experience the intersecting stigma of being gender diverse and racial minorities, are at even greater risk of poor mental health. A 2022 national survey of 33,993 LGBTQ+ young people by the Trevor Project, a non-profit, found that one in four Black transgender and nonbinary youth attempted suicide in the past year, more than double the rate of their cisgender counterparts.

“It's already difficult to access healthcare and treatment. It's additionally difficult for folks who belong to other marginalized communities, especially families and children of color, as well as folks who are on various forms of state-funded insurance and may have difficulty selecting their providers to begin with,” Harper Seldin, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU, told the Guardian.

“There is already a subset of gender clinics in this country who provide this care. When you lay over on top of that insurance and access based on family means, it's particularly devastating for families who can't just pick up and go somewhere else – to another city, state or other country – to get care.”

While her trans daughter's care hasn't been directly affected by the executive order, Sarah, a Texas mother who asked that her last name not be used to protect her daughter's privacy, said that her daughter Raven was devastated by the president's directive. Raven, a 16-year-old Black trans girl in Texas who is using a pseudonym, dropped out of school last month due to her declining mental health, exacerbated by the federal ban. Sarah said that Raven had rarely got out of bed, and when she did, she would show her mom news reports of murdered Black trans girls and women.

“She has told me that she's afraid of being killed if she leaves the house,” Sarah said. “She really only will leave the house with me. But that's very few and far between, because she's just incredibly depressed.”

Since dropping out of school, Sarah said that Raven's depression and anxiety significantly decreased, and she plans to start GED test preparation classes over the summer.

In November 2024, the LGBTQ+ non-profit Human Rights Campaign Foundation released a report that showed that half of the 36 transgender people killed in the last 12 months were Black trans women. That reality has made it terrifying for Raven to live as a Black trans girl, Sarah said.

Raven's medical providers have increased her antidepressants dosage, and she now checks in with her psychiatrist every three weeks. Since last year, Raven has had to fly to Colorado every six months to receive gender-affirming care due to a Texas ban on treatment for minors. She has received grants from the non-profit Campaign on Southern Equality to fund the travel for medical treatment, which has helped defer some of the exorbitant costs of seeking out-of-state care.

Sarah said that she has researched living in other nations and would be willing to order medicine from Canada if Raven could no longer get medical treatment in Colorado. Gender-affirming care has drastically improved Raven's life. “She feels more herself,” Sarah said. “If she didn't have it, I don't think she would choose to stay alive.”

Navigating medical care restrictions has caused anxiety for parents who are shouldering the burden of the policies' twists and turns for their children. A Georgia-based parent, Peter Isbister, said that he had chosen not to share the news of the executive order with his 11-year-old trans son Lev, who is using a pseudonym out of fear of harassment: “It's taken a psychological toll on his parents, not on him.”

An endocrinologist is currently monitoring Lev's hormone levels to determine when he will be put on puberty blockers. Isbister, an attorney and founder of the peer support network Metro Atlanta TransParent, has to contend with the federal executive order and a looming ban on puberty blockers for minors in Georgia.

“If the bill passes in Georgia, then we as a family are going to really have to study up more seriously on how it works to be an out-of-state person to get care in California, New Mexico, Massachusetts or wherever,” Isbister said. “And the more states that restrict access to care, the harder that's going to be.”

As a result of the federal and state policies, Isbister said that he has talked with an immigration attorney about acquiring Canadian citizenship for his son. But at least for now, Lev's clinic continues to provide him care.

While Isbister was “heartened” by the judge's injunction on the executive order, he said that it is “wrenching and in my view unjust that my ability to provide my kid healthcare should be an issue for our federal courts”.</p>

                Protestors gathered outside the Department of Veterans Affairs headquarters in Washington, DC, US, on Feb. 13, 2025. The agency plans to cut 80,000 jobs.

In the wake of federal firings and executive orders, providers and patients at the Department of Veterans Affairs say mental health and mental health care are suffering.

They fear this struggle will get worse as the VA carries through with 80,000 promised job cuts. The agency is one of the largest providers of mental health care in the country.

"I've been really struggling with my concentration and my ability to focus when I'm at work, because I feel like I have this ax over my head all the time," says a mental health provider who asked NPR not to disclose the location of her work and to identify her only as Lynn, her middle name, for fear she could be fired for speaking out. 

Lynn is especially concerned about her clients who identify as LGBTQ, since one executive order called on federal employees to eliminate "equity related," grants or contracts and another directed them to recognize only two sexes.

Consequently employees at the VA have been directed to remove symbols such as flags that indicate support for transgender or queer rights. "We're kind of skirting around that," says Lynn. "Some people have put up art in their office that says 'Love is love,' or a rainbow. So we're all kind of being subversive."

Therapists in other locations reported similar concern that these patients — already in a marginalized population — are being singled out and targeted for discrimination. They employed strategies similar to Lynn's to silently communicate a message of solidarity to patients who identify as LGBTQ.

These rebellions come with a price.

"If I wear this stuff, am I then gonna become a target from either my patients or maybe my peers?" asks Lynn. "Because there's this culture of, 'you need to rat on people.'"

Employees at the VA have received emails encouraging them to report colleagues who are violating the new ban on diversity, equity and inclusion. There have also been high profile firings in the military of leaders who are Black or female.

Lynn says these changes are destabilizing to patients as well. " We've had patients going to the medical records and asking for their charts to be altered," she says, "to remove references to their gender identity or their sexual orientation because they're fearing that they might be put on a list or that they might be discriminated against."

Some patients who have post-traumatic stress disorder say the changes are especially disconcerting. One woman, who asked to be identified only as D.M., says she's been suffering from near-constant anxiety since the changes began at the VA. She served for 26 years on active duty as a nurse and was sexually assaulted by a fellow service member. She says since then, she's strictly avoided being alone in rooms with men.

"Even if you have to grab the office secretary, you make sure you are not one-on-one with that male, and that's to protect you and to protect him," says D.M.

Receiving both mental and physical health care at an all-women's clinic, she says, has been tremendously helpful. D.M. fears such spaces will be eliminated from veteran and army life." We're gonna get rid of anything that involves women, transgender, you know, all that stuff," she says.

The VA has not announced plans to cut such clinics, and the stated purpose of the executive order D.M. references on gender is to "protect women." In an emailed statement from the VA, spokesperson Peter Kasperowicz wrote, "The VA will always provide veterans, families, caregivers and survivors the health care and benefits they have earned."

Doug Collins, secretary of Veterans Affairs, has promised to preserve "mission critical" positions such as clinicians.

But some VA employees and veterans' advocates warn that getting rid of any staff could compromise care in a system that is predicated on an integrated model of physical and mental health, including research positions.

"Having high quality research is a part of high quality care," says Rashi Romanoff, CEO of a non-profit, The National Association of Veterans' Research and Education Foundations (NAVREF). The group does advocacy for research for veterans and warns that $35 million worth of research that is underway could be lost if the VA does not indefinitely preserve between 350 and 400 clinical trials.

In an emailed statement to NPR, VA spokesperson Kasperowicz said the agency would continue to fund these programs for 90 days "while the department conducts a comprehensive assessment of ongoing research." Trials include research on topics such as suicide mitigation and treatment for substance use disorder, according to NAVREF's data collection.

Nurse practitioner Lynn says going to work everyday feels like she's working on the Titanic. "Half the people on the boat are still in the ballroom partying and 25 percent of them are actively telling me I'm hysterical," she says.

She plans to stay aboard until she has no choice but to save herself.

At Lakeland Robin's job is to spend time with residents, have conversations with them, play games and other activities.

FORT WAYNE, Ind. (WFFT) – Lakeland Rehabilitation and Healthcare Center unveiled a new staff member whose name is Robin the robot.

Robin is an A.I. generated social interactive robot.

At Lakeland, Robin's job is to spend time with residents, have conversations with them, play games and other activities.

The robot will work in the memory care unit specializing with residents that suffer from Alzheimer's and dementia.

“As that disease progresses, they begin to sometimes become a little bit more reclusive as they're not able to communicate as they once were so Robin will really assist in that nature of spending that one-on-one time with each resident," Executive Director Lindsey Floyd said.

Residents got to spend some time with the new staff member before the unveiling.

“I thought it was really interesting, we played a game, she [Robin] told me I'm a genius," resident Donald Boneff.

Lakeland staff learned they would get Robin at the end of 2024. Robin is the second AI-generated robot in long-term care in Indiana.

Floyd says Robin will work a shift of its own.

“Once we unplug her, get her geared up and ready for the day, and then enter the day about 4 o'clock so she'll just bebop around the facility, engage with residents," Floyd said.

Despite a unanimous scientific consensus, health experts are once again defending the safety of childhood vaccines and so-called autism risk.

Health and Human Services (HHS) officials led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., recently confirmed that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will investigate whether vaccines cause autism. 

The public health announcement reignited a longstanding debate over a theory lacking substantial scientific evidence.

“As President Trump said in his Joint Address to Congress, the rate of autism in American children has skyrocketed. CDC will leave no stone unturned in its mission to figure out what exactly is happening,” a department statement said. “The American people expect high quality research and transparency and that is what CDC is delivering.”

Vaccines are widely regarded as safe and effective. However, vaccine skepticism and hesitancy have contributed to low childhood vaccination rates in the United States. 

Vaccinations help prevent the spread of infectious diseases while protecting those who can't receive them. Most health experts agree they do not cause autism.

Experts told Healthline there have been multitudes of reputable studies on the topic over the past 20 years, and none have established a definitive link between autism and childhood vaccines.

“The scientific community has researched this very thoroughly and there's no evidence that childhood vaccine cause autism,” said Danelle Fisher, MD, a pediatrician at Providence Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.

“Scientists from around the world have approached this question in several different ways and none has found a relationship,” added Bryan King, MD, vice chair for child psychiatry and a professor in the school of medicine at the University of California San Francisco. “Scientists have also looked at whether different preservatives in vaccines could have an effect and none exists.”

Experts reaffirmed the importance of children receiving their scheduled vaccinations to prevent infectious and potentially deadly illnesses like measles from spreading. The growing measles outbreak that began in western Texas in January has been linked to low vaccination rates.

“In some ways, we are victims of our success when it comes to vaccines,” King said. “They can be so successful in preventing severe illness and death that we can lose sight of why we need or want to be protected from those potentially devastating diseases. We forget how devastating those diseases are.”

King and other experts noted that vaccinating the majority of children can help protect children who can't receive vaccines because they are undergoing cancer treatment or have compromised immune systems.

“We need to cocoon these kids,” said Gina Posner, MD, a pediatrician at MemorialCare Medical Group in Fountain Valley, CA.

“It is incumbent upon everyone to be good community members,” added Fisher.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a broad term used to describe a group of neurodevelopmental conditions.

The conditions generally affect communication and social interaction. People on the autism spectrum often demonstrate restricted and repetitive interests or patterns of behavior, and language skills are often delayed in children.

The degree to which a person falls on the autism spectrum may vary greatly from person to person. Five subtypes of autism have been identified.

Most people are diagnosed with autism as children, but adults are sometimes diagnosed as well.

Some symptoms of autism may include:

Experts say early intervention when children are young can help ease symptoms and help autistic people improve their quality of life.

“Early intervention is amazing,” Posner told Healthline. Some early intervention therapies for autism may include:

President Donald Trump and HHS Secretary RFK Jr. have quoted figures saying autism rates in the U.S. have skyrocketed from 1 in 10,000 children in 2000 to 1 in 36 children today. The 1 in 10,000 number appears to come from a single study in the 1960s.

The CDC reports that autism rates have more likely increased from 1 in 150 children in 2000 to 1 in 36 today.

The agency also notes that an autism diagnosis is four times more common in boys than it is in girls.

Experts note they believe the increase in autism rates in the past two decades is due to better diagnosis of the condition. King points out that vaccination rates have not increased in the past 10 years while the rate of autism diagnoses has gone up.

“The rate of autism is as much as it's always been. Now, it's just identified better,” Fisher told Healthline.

“A lot of it is we are better at diagnosing,” added Posner.

King added that “the definition of autism now includes a broader spectrum, which may partially explain the increase in prevalence over earlier estimates.”

If vaccines don't cause autism, then what does?

Experts say there are probably a multitude of factors behind the development of autism, but they say the number one reason is most likely genetics, noting that autism tends to be more common in some families than in others.

In 2023, researchers reported they had identified seven genes linked to an increased risk of autism. 

When introducing their research results, they also noted that prior research has estimated that 50% of genetic risk can be predicted by common genetic variation, and another 15% to 20% is due to spontaneous mutations or predictable inheritance patterns.

“None of the hundreds of genes that contribute to the risk for autism is specific, that is, that a so-called autism gene always or only leads to autism,” King told Healthline. 

“But these genes disrupt the usual development or function of pathways in the brain in ways that significantly increase autism risk. The timing of these effects begins before birth, so as scientists look for causes of autism, the focus is on genes or environmental exposures that occur long before children are receiving immunizations,” he added.

Experts said that children of older parents tend to have higher autism risks due to the aging of sperm and eggs. A 2020 study determined that children born to older parents have a 50% higher risk of autism.

Posner added there is also evidence that premature infants have higher autism risks, as do children born to mothers with gestational diabetes.

“You can't specifically point to one cause,” said Fisher. “No two autistic kids are the same.”

Officials at the CDC announced they will study whether childhood vaccines are a potential cause of autism.

Experts say there have been a multitude of scientific studies done on this subject over the past 20 years, and none have concluded that vaccinations are linked to autism risk.

Genetics is likely a top factor for autism risk. Children born to older parents, as well as those born prematurely or to mothers with gestational diabetes, may also have higher risks.

Children should continue to follow their recommended immunization schedules to prevent the spread of disease as well as to protect children who can't receive vaccines.
