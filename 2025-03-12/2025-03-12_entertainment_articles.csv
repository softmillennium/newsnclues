Daylight savings, temperatures creeping upward, wool coats tossed aside for a light jacket: Spring is in the air, and with it, Haim season. The sisters may have spent weeks teasing the first single off their new album through several funny little videos and familiar-looking album art, but the tell-tale sign of new Haim music is when the weather gets good and people feel like acting up. It may always be warm in California, but Haim’s penchant for creating music specifically designed to be listened to in the car with the windows down has never felt more apparent than in their newest song, “Relationships.”

“How did we get ourselves into this?” Danielle Haim sings, more disdainful than saddened by the dissolution at the heart of the single. The song is full of existential questions like that, boiling down to a central thesis of “Why am I in this relationship?,” but rather than belabor romantic mistakes in a low-key ballad or mid-tempo jam, the sisters opt for a groovy, dancier track. It’s a decidedly sexier sound for them, more reminiscent of ’90s R&B than their usual So-Cal rock. Rostam Batmanglij may be partially responsible for this updated sound, as the Vampire Weekend alum and solo artist co-produced the new album alongside Danielle (who, somewhat coincidentally, recently split with Vampire Weekend producrr Ariel Rechtshaid … so maybe the titular relationships in question are all in the family, so to speak). While the sisters Haim frequently make lyrical pop-ish rock music, “Relationships” ups the ante by being the type of song that might drag you out of your chair and out onto the dance floor.

The new video, directed by Camille Summers-Valli, depicts Danielle alongside sisters Este and Alana, moving out of a house after a breakup with an unnamed beau played by Queer heartthrob Drew Starkey. The music video moves in reverse, starting with the sisters packing up the car, taking us back through Danielle’s ennui lying in bed alone, to whenever she and Starkey’s character first met, dancing at the club. Starkey makes for the perfect ex: somehow both doe-eyed and a jock. Whatever occurred between him and Danielle in the context of the video remains unclear, but Summers-Valli’s inclination to move in reverse allows the video to end on a real high note.

It’s the sisters’ first video not directed by Paul Thomas Anderson in some time, and Summers-Valli lends the song a fun innovative form that doesn’t let the whole thing become too self-serious or too funny. As hot as the video is at times, Summers-Valli maintains a strong female gaze, allowing the sisters to be both forces of romantic authority (or sisterly annoyance) as well as sex symbols, clad in neutral, athletic basics. It’s kind of giving Uniqlo ad in the best possible way. “So don’t let it bring you down,” Danielle warns toward the end of the song, “’cause it all comes back around.” So if you think about it, Haim summer is always both behind us and ahead of us: You just have to wait it out. In that way, “Relationships” feels like it’s moving both forward and backward at the same time, allowing the band to open new doors by indulging in an old sound we know and love.",vulture
https://vulture.com,The Pitt Was Testing Us,https://www.vulture.com/article/the-pitt-santos-langdon-accusation-doctor-bias-analysis.html,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 14:01:12 GMT","By stoking viewers’ dislike of Santos and then proving her right, The Pitt is turning around its thematic interest in bias so that it also implicates us. Photo-Illustration: Vulture; Photos: Warrick Page/Max

Spoilers follow for The Pitt through the tenth episode “4:00 P.M.,” which premiered on Max on March 6.

All ten episodes of The Pitt so far have pushed us toward a certain idea: Who the hell does Dr. Trinity Santos think she is?

Of all the characters in the Max medical drama’s deep ensemble, the big-talking, shit-stirring first-year resident is tailor-made to get on our nerves. Santos bullies her fellow trainees at Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center with condescending nicknames and treats patients like game pieces. She leverages surgeon Dr. Yolanda Garcia’s (possibly romantic) interest in her to perform procedures she shouldn’t be doing this early in her career and then proves she’s not prepared enough by dropping a scalpel into Garcia’s foot. She goes behind the back of her supervising senior resident, Dr. Frank Langdon, over and over, acting as if she knows better than nearly everyone else when it’s just her first day.

One of the most consistent things about The Pitt, as dependable as fourth-year med student Dennis Whitaker getting gross stuff splashed on him, is that Santos will be a pain in the ass. And that consistency is incredibly clever because, by stoking viewers’ dislike of Santos — she’s too rude, too young, too ambitious, too much — and then proving her right about Langdon’s drug thieving, The Pitt turns around its thematic interest in bias so that it also implicates us. Now PTMC’s doctors aren’t the only people dealing with their own prejudices, distortions, and preconceived notions. In being led so easily into doubting Santos, we’re put on blast for our own innate ageism, sexism, and “Jeez, she’s a lot”–ism, too.

The Pitt attempts a level of accuracy that has been praised as “absolutely” reflective of how actual emergency departments run, and that fast-paced, real-time nature lets the show take on a variety of cases, and their accompanying biases, per episode. One of its recurrent tensions is how much time doctors spend with patients: The hospital administrators simultaneously want doctors to see sick people more quickly and still receive higher patient-satisfaction scores, and that impossible demand weighs on “the pit” and its backed-up waiting room. And because hospitals are denying doctors necessary resources and rushing them through their diagnoses, The Pitt argues, doctors are going to make mistakes and missteps that hurt patients. No doctor is immune from a wrong judgment call, either because they’re denied time or they’re falling into the same rote patterns of detection, investigation, and determination that have worked for them before. What matters is how the doctors respond to being called out by their superiors and peers for those errors and how they act with their next patient. Reciting the Hippocratic Oath isn’t enough — they have to live it.

Because The Pitt focuses on its characters’ growth, those bias arcs usually end with someone vowing to do better; PTMC is a teaching hospital, after all. The Pitt has routinely emphasized how much being a doctor involves subjective decision-making against objective data and how that subjectivity can be swayed by opinions doctors may not even realize they have. Sometimes these lessons are taught top-down: Third-year resident Dr. Samira Mohan teaches Whitaker to challenge his assumptions when a Black woman who is initially dismissed as an addict is actually in sickle-cell crisis, and Mohan firmly corrects Whitaker when he tries to lowball the woman’s morphine intake because he doesn’t take seriously how much pain she’s in. In a later episode, senior resident Dr. Heather Collins gently chastises second-year resident Dr. Cassie McKay for not doing a thorough enough exam of a larger woman experiencing abdominal pain and for missing her widespread infection. “I raise it as a possibility, not as an accusation” is Collins’s measured answer when McKay asks, “Are you saying I was biased against the patient because of her weight?”

To extend the idea that PTMC is a teaching hospital where everyone can learn, sometimes the series’ corrections flow the other way. Third-year medical student Victoria Javadi proactively changes a trans patient’s incorrect gender pronouns in her medical file, drawing praise from McKay. Second-year resident Dr. Mel King questions Langdon’s bluntness with an autistic patient and pushes against his declaration that the patient’s autism has nothing to do with his current diagnosis. And sometimes the biases feel like setups for a later narrative payoff, such as Robby’s and McKay’s differing reactions to possible homicidal incel David, who’s still in the wind after fleeing PTMC and his concerned mother. Robby thought McKay was overreacting by calling the cops on the teen, but as he admits to her after David goes missing, “I did not think enough about those girls” David had threatened to harm. How much Robby may come to regret his own soft-handed reaction to David’s menace we’ll have to wait to find out.

For the most part, these professionals accept correction with a certain amount of humility and resolve to do better — which is very much not how Santos has acted for most of the season. Even with her admission early on that she uses “sarcasm and comedy as a shield,” it has been hard as a viewer not to get irritated with her constantly cringe behavior: her flustered defensiveness when Mohan criticizes her flippant small talk with a college student whose friend died of a drug overdose; her unpolished questioning of a young girl about whether her father is sexually abusing her; and her ordering medical tests without Langdon’s approval. Santos usually means well, but she can’t seem to break away from insubordination, either.

Of course, it’s possible two things can be true at the same time: that Santos can be pushy and rude and that she was right about Langdon helping himself to the hospital’s drugs and stealing patients’ prescriptions. But with hindsight, it becomes clear how much The Pitt guided us down the anti-Santos path almost as a test, intentionally amping up her prickly qualities and the resistance from her more experienced colleagues to see how willing we were to fall into the same traps of misconception as The Pitt’s own characters. Would we have been so quick to turn on Santos if she were nicer to her fellow trainees or more faithfully followed the rules? If she smiled more? If Langdon weren’t so handsome? If Santos were male and Langdon female? If either of them were a different race or closer in age? If Langdon slid into twitchy paranoia more quickly? Was it only after Robby found those pills in Langdon’s locker that you finally accepted she was right, and if so, is that the only thing that could have convinced you?

When it comes to its doctors’ biases, The Pitt reveals most of them after they have already affected a patient, so we settle into a pattern of being surprised by the disclosure and then soothed by the character’s humble vow to do better. In presenting Santos as more bristly than deferential, The Pitt conditions us to suspect her motives and treat her differently from other characters, toward whom we may be more inclined to extend grace. It created in us the bias it asks us to recognize in others — trapped us in the pit, you might say, and then helped us climb out by making us admit our own preconceptions. When Collins tells Robby, “Leave your baggage at the door like everyone else,” that’s also The Pitt telling all of us how to watch.",vulture
https://vulture.com,Will Shortz Is Back in the Game,https://www.vulture.com/article/nytimes-crossword-will-shortz-puzzle-editor-interview.html,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 07:00:37 GMT","Photo: Stefan Ruiz for New York Magazine

In February 2024, the New York Times crossword editor Will Shortz was sitting at his desk in Pleasantville, hard at work around 11 p.m., when he shifted to the left and found he couldn’t shift back. The side of his mouth was drooling. Shortz recognized the signs: He was having a stroke. Later, at the hospital, he had a second, larger stroke and then, after thrombolysis to dissolve the clot that caused it, a brain bleed — a rare and serious complication. He spent ten days in intensive care, prognosis uncertain, before he was stable enough to move to an inpatient rehab center, where he would begin the long work of recovery.

Early on, Shortz said, the doctors offered him a sliver of good news: The strokes had affected the right hemisphere of his brain (which controls nonverbal abilities, like emotions and musicality), not the left (where linguistic abilities, like puzzling, originate — though all brain function involves both sides to some degree). While still in the hospital, he was making puzzles again, and before his full recovery, he left the rehab facility to attend the annual American Crossword Puzzle Tournament, which he founded. “When I came out of the wheelchair and went up onstage, there was just thunderous applause,” Shortz said, sitting in a newly set up workspace in his house in Pleasantville, wedged between a kitchen with NPR mugs drying on the dish rack (he has also been puzzle master for “Weekend Edition Sunday” since 1987) and a white leather couch draped with a crossword-print throw. “Really brings tears to my eyes to think about it.”

Shortz has been the puzzle editor at the Times since 1993, when he was considered a young upstart: At 41, he was 36 years younger than his predecessor, Eugene T. Maleska. But time passes quickly in easy Mondays, tricky Thursdays, taxing Saturdays, and oversize Sundays. About a month after his strokes, the paper announced that for the first time in 30 years, the crossword would be in non-Shortz, though recognizably Shortzian, hands: those of Joel Fagliano, who has published under Shortz since he was 17, spent college summers as Shortz’s intern, and became a puzzle editor at the Times in 2016.

The Times crossword has a relationship to other crosswords roughly akin to the one the paper has with competitors: It’s beloved and assailed equally. A vibrant, often cranky community of solvers congregate in blog comments and Reddit threads to celebrate and complain as puzzling has proliferated. Under Shortz, the crossword has modernized, though a running conversation in Crossworld is whether he has modernized enough. The decades-stale fill of the pre-Shortz crosswords, when any reference less than 25 years old was deemed suspect, has been replaced by BABYSHARK. Female constructors and constructors of color have ticked up but still fall far short of parity. (The Times runs an annual Diverse Crossword Constructor Fellowship to try to address this.)

When Shortz started out, he was the Times’ sole full-time puzzle employee; now, there are roughly 100. The main crossword has been joined by the Mini and new games like Wordle and Connections with more likely to come. The “Games” department is a major moneymaker and subscription driver to an increasingly polyvalent company. The paper is cagey about specific numbers, but more than 11 billion of its puzzles were solved last year. More than 150 crossword submissions come in every week, of which 10 to 15 percent make it to the weekly Thursday “maybe” meeting. Shortz has the final say.

After arriving home in a wheelchair in April, with a long road to recovery still in front of him, Shortz threw himself into rehabilitation. He moved quickly from the wheelchair to walking with a cane to walking unassisted. He still has a pronounced limp on the left side; otherwise, presiding over his kitchen table in a pair of gym shorts, he looks hardly changed from the grinning, mustachioed man familiar to generations of solvers from the covers of the many published collections of crosswords he has edited, though his hair is a little thinner on top. A major brain injury might be enough to dim anyone’s sunniness, but Shortz bore up cheerfully. He has an imperturbable equanimity joined to a logician’s clarity. “That’s funny,” he would say steadily if I said something he thought was funny. “I’m a naturally optimistic, upbeat person,” he told me. “Even if I lost an arm or a leg or something, I would figure out how to make the best of it.”

Shortz volunteered to bring me along to his two-hour session of physical and occupational therapy at Rehabologym, a “neurorobotic” facility in Tarrytown he visits several times a week. As soon as we entered, a group of therapists — some assigned to him, others walking patients in robotic exoskeletons to train their gaits or restore atrophying muscles — perked up: “What’ve you got for us today, Will?” A puzzle master is never unprepared. As he bounced through Wii-style video games — Shortz as a squat-thrusting octopus, Shortz as a slaloming penguin — designed to retrain his flexibility, balance, and reach, he called out clue after clue. Name two heroines of Shakespeare, nine letters, beginning with C and ending with A! (Cleopatra, Cassandra.) Name two six-letter animals that begin with B and end with R! (Beaver, badger.)

At the end of the session, his husband, a 30-year-old programmer and gamer whom Shortz asked me to call “S” for privacy’s sake, picked us up. The two share a passion for table tennis and met in 2021 at the Westchester Table Tennis Center, which Shortz co-founded, and following their courtship, Shortz came out as gay. They got married there in 2023 before a crowd of fellow players and a few Times colleagues; the reception included games of trivia about the couple and a scavenger hunt. Despite a 42-year age difference, and S’s indifference to crosswords, they seem quite contentedly in love. The day after I met them, I couldn’t help noticing 48-down in the Thursday puzzle: “Separation in some relationships?” (AGEGAP.)

Shortz plays table tennis two to three times per week against his husband (who now routinely wins) or one of the club’s national-champion pros. (Until his strokes, he had a 4,141-day streak of uninterrupted daily play.) His standing has fallen somewhat — the day I visited, the club rankings listed him as No. 52; S was No. 5 — but both the therapists at Rehabologym and the pros at the Westchester Table Tennis Center consider it a critical part of his recovery. “He’s getting there,” Rawle Alleyne, the former national table-tennis coach of Barbados, told me as balls flew by us in all directions. “I can see the progress.” The popcorn sound of dozens of balls connecting with paddles filled the air.

Shortz returned to his post just before the New Year. When I asked Fagliano what he thought about his brief tenure as lead editor, he said, “One of the highest compliments I got was somebody telling me they hadn’t even noticed.” The biggest difference, he said, was that he “maybe took a lighter touch on some of the younger pop culture.”

Though Shortz has already identified his pick for his successor — Fagliano — it’s the Times that will decide. Whoever it is will have to wait in any case; Shortz insisted he was in no rush. “I’m doing exactly what I want,” he said. “I never plan to retire.” He and S. are going to take a brief break, though, to honeymoon in Grenzau, Germany. “There’s a four-star hotel,” Shortz said, “and just across the street is a table-tennis facility.”",vulture

Peacock, you better watch out, Gaggy isn’t playing around. The Traitors S3 winner Gabby Windey is calling out the streamer and reminding them that she’s still waiting for a check. On WWHL on March 11, Windey said one of her thorns on the reality series is not getting paid for her winnings yet. She proclaimed her thorns on the show with dollar signs in her eyes, “[I] still haven’t seen a dime. Everybody knows here at Bravo, NBC, Peacock… Not receiving my money. I’m still waiting on the money!” She also jokingly (and probably not so jokingly) told Jimmy Fallon that she wouldn’t consider going on an All Stars season just yet until she gets paid. She explained, “There’s not enough time that’s passed. I don’t know. I need a break. I need my money! I still haven’t even gotten my money. This is NBC; I’ve been screaming.” Accounting departments should fear her.

However, it looks like she might be getting her winnings soon. People reports that the streamer is waiting on a signature from Windey’s team to get the check sent through. But in the meantime, if she needs another NBC show to sound off on until then, maybe Seth Meyers is available.",vulture
https://vulture.com,Everything That’s Happened to the Menendez Brothers Since Monsters,https://www.vulture.com/article/menendez-brothers-now-what-to-know.html,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 20:20:00 GMT","Photo-Illustration: Vulture; Photos: Los Angeles Times/Getty Images, Miles Crist/Netflix

When Ryan Murphy’s Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story was released on Netflix in September 2024, his true-crime drama spurred calls for a reexamination of Lyle and Erik Menendez’s murder case — as well as demands for the brothers’ release from prison after more than three decades. The coinciding release of Netflix’s The Menendez Brothers documentary in early October further intensified interest. Indeed, public understanding about victimhood and violence has directed attention to the context of these killings and whether the brothers were prevented from presenting a comprehensive defense, as a judge imposed limits on evidence of familial sexual abuse at their second trial. The brothers’ high-profile supporters include Kim Kardashian, Murphy’s friend and collaborator, and Rosie O’Donnell.

The brothers are also backed by many family members — including their mother’s sister — who cited the abuse they suffered. Los Angeles prosecutors reviewed the case and, despite the previous Los Angeles District Attorney initially advising a resentencing for the brothers, newly elected D.A. Nathan Hochman withdrew support for resentencing on March 10. Their next hearing in front of the California Parole Board is scheduled for June 13. “We will submit that report to the judge for the resentencing,” California governor Gavin Newsom explained on his podcast. “That will weigh into our independent analysis of whether or not to move forward with the clemency application to support a commutation of this case.”

Let’s go back: What did the Menendez brothers do?

In 1996, the brothers were convicted of first-degree murder for killing their parents, José and Kitty Menendez, in their Beverly Hills home seven years prior. The path to their conviction was not straightforward. Lyle, who had dialed 911 and told authorities, “Someone killed my parents,” was arrested in March 1990 after the brothers admitted to their therapist that they killed their parents, per CNN. After Lyle was arrested, Erik surrendered several days later, for alleged first-degree murder. They were first tried in 1993, each with their own jury, in a highly publicized trial broadcast by Court TV. The prosecution claimed that they murdered their parents for money. Their respective defense attorneys conceded that they had killed their father and mother but claimed it was in self-defense after their father had sexually abused them for years.

The juries in their first trial could not reach a unanimous verdict. The brothers were retried in October 1995 with one jury for both of them. Most of the defense’s evidence about sexual abuse was barred from court, CNN said. They were both found guilty of first-degree murder in March 1996. A judge sentenced the brothers to life in prison — without the chance of parole — in July of that year. Lyle and Erik have previously appealed their convictions to no avail with the California Courts of Appeal, and Supreme Court of California, upholding their convictions in 1998 and 1999, Variety noted. They were also unsuccessful in their federal-court appeal.

Why are people reevaluating the case right now?

Monsters, understandably, brought renewed attention to the Menendez brothers’ case, but prior to that, interest was resparked in May 2023 when a prominent musician accused José of sexual abuse. Roy Rosselló, an ex-member of the boy band Menudo, claimed that José — who was a record executive — raped him. Rosselló’s allegations in the three-part Peacock docuseries Menendez + Menudo: Boys Betrayed bolstered the brothers’ claims that their father was an abuser, Variety noted. The brothers’ attorneys filed a petition with the court, requesting that their convictions and life sentences get overturned, citing Rosselló’s accusation.

They also noted that, eight months before the killings, Erik had sent his cousin a letter, in which he discusses his father’s predatory behavior, CNN explained. “Its still happening Andy but its worse for me now,” the December 1998 letter said. “He’s so overweight that I can’t stand to see him,” the letter says. “I never know when its going to happen and its driving me crazy. Every night I stay up thinking he might come in. I need to put it out of my mind. I know what you said before but I’m afraid. You just don’t know dad like I do. He’s crazy! He’s warned me a hundred times about telling anyone especially Lyle. Am I a serious whimpus? I don’t know I’ll make it through this. I can handle it, Andy. I need to stop thinking about it.” José’s younger sister allegedly found the letter and showed it to journalist Robert Rand some six years ago. Rand, in turn, showed this letter to Erik’s onetime appeals lawyer. This letter was not shown during either of the brothers’ trials, CNN said.

What has the family said about Monsters?

The brothers do not approve of Murphy’s show at all. “I believed we had moved beyond the lies and ruinous character portrayals of Lyle, creating a caricature of Lyle rooted in horrible and blatant lies rampant in the show. I can only believe they were done so on purpose. It is with a heavy heart that I say, I believe Ryan Murphy cannot be this naïve and inaccurate about the facts of our lives so as to do this without bad intent,” Erik said in a post on Lyle’s Facebook page. “So now Murphy shapes his horrible narrative through vile and appalling character portrayals of Lyle and of me and disheartening slander.”

How has the Monsters’ cast reacted to criticism?

Javier Bardem, Nathan Lane, and Cooper Koch responded to Erik’s comments. Lane, who plays journalist Dominick Dunne, said, “He’s just criticizing it and condemning it without ever having seen it, so one has to take that with a grain of salt. Obviously, to have your life portrayed this way in a Netflix miniseries … he wasn’t one of the producers, so not everything might be flattering or make you happy. But I would say you should probably see it before you speak out again.” Bardem, who plays José, reflected that it’s “absolutely normal, logical and legitimate” to be worried about a dramatization involving one’s deepest tragedies. Koch, who portrays Erik, said that Erik’s response prompted him to “feel things” but believed the research he conducted for his role was accurate. “I get it. I understand how difficult it would be to have the worst part of your life be televised for millions of people to see. It’s so exposing. I understand how he feels and I stand by him,” Koch said.

Murphy, for his part, had a more acerbic reaction. “We had an obligation to so many people, not just to Erik and Lyle,” he told The Hollywood Reporter. “But that’s what I find so fascinating; that they’re playing the victim card right now — ‘poor, pitiful us’ — which I find reprehensible and disgusting.” Prior to this, Murphy seemed to criticize Erik for speaking out without viewing Monsters. “I think it’s interesting that he’s issued a statement without having seen the show. I know he hasn’t seen the show in prison. I hope he does see the show,” Murphy said. “It’s really, really hard — if it’s your life — to see your life up onscreen.”

What have the brothers’ family said about their case since the show’s release?

During an October 16 press conference, more than one dozen of the Menendez brothers’ relatives demanded their release from prison. “I had no idea the extent of the abuse they suffered at the hands of my brother-in-law. None of us did,” Joan Andersen VanderMolen, Kitty’s sister, said, per ABC7 Eyewitness News. “We know that abuse has long effects, and victims of trauma sometimes act in ways that are very difficult to understand.” When the brothers were tried, VanderMolen said, “the whole world was not ready to hear that boys could be raped,” but “today we know better.”

“They tried to protect themselves the only way they knew how,” Brian Andersen Jr., Kitty’s nephew, reportedly said. “Instead of being seen as victims, they were vilified … they are no longer a threat to society.” Anamaria Baralt, one of José’s nieces, offered a similar view. “If Lyle and Erik’s case were heard today, with the understanding we now have about abuse and PTSD, there is no doubt in my mind that their sentencing would have been very different.”

What have authorities said recently?

On March 10, newly elected L.A. County District Attorney Nathan Hochman filed a motion to rescind his predecessor’s recommendation for resentencing the brother’s decision. “The Menendez brothers have continued to lie for over 30 years about their self-defense — that is, their purported actual fear that their mother and their father were going to kill them the night of the murders,” Hochman explained. “Also, over those 30 years, they have failed to accept responsibility for the vast number of lies they told in connection with that defense.”

However, California governor Gavin Newsom disagrees with Hochman’s views and shares that the brothers will have separate parole hearings on June 13 despite his motion. The hearing will decide whether or not the brother will be resentenced, granted parole, or maintain their current sentencing.

What did the former D.A. originally write in the recommendation?

Former Los Angeles district attorney George Gascón recommended a resentencing for the brothers on October 24 before he lost re-election to Hochman. “After a very careful review of all the arguments that were made for people on both sides of this equation, I came to a place where I believe that under the law, resentencing is appropriate, and I am going to recommend that to our court tomorrow,” Gascón said at the time. The prosecutors are now seeking 50 years to life for the brothers, whose ages at the time they committed the crime makes them both immediately eligible for parole. “They have been in prison 35 years,” Gascón added. “I believe they have paid their debt to society, and the system provides a vehicle for their case to be reviewed by a parole board.”

Gascón also released a statement following the family’s October 16 press conference. “We have heard the heartfelt pleas from the Menendez family regarding a review of this case. While we cannot formally comment on any decisions at this time, please know that our office is dedicated to a thorough and fair process and is exploring every avenue available to our office to ensure justice is served,” Gascón said. Lawyers from his office met with the brothers’ family to hear out their concerns. “Prosecutors are still seeking full documentation of the defense’s claims. The office is working as quickly as justice permits,” the statement continued. “Our office has developed a more modern understanding of sexual violence since the Menendez brothers first faced prosecution. Today, our office acknowledges that sexual violence is a pervasive issue affecting countless individuals — of all gender identities — and we are committed to supporting all victims as they navigate the profound impacts of such trauma.”

How does Kim Kardashian fit into all of this?

Kim Kardashian, who is a vocal advocate for prison reform, visited the brothers, TMZ first reported in September. Kardashian also wrote an essay for NBC News on October 3, in which she argued that they should not be behind bars for life. “I doubt anyone would claim to be the same person they were at 18,” she said. “I know I’m not!” Kardashian discusses their father’s sexual abuse in her op-ed. She also said that the brothers had “no chance of a fair trial” with the attention on their case and evidentiary rulings:

“Back then, there were limited resources for victims of sexual abuse, particularly for boys. There were virtually no systems in place to support survivors, and public awareness of the trauma of male sexual abuse was minimal, often clouded by preconceived judgments and homophobia. Can anyone honestly deny that the justice system would have treated the Menendez sisters more leniently?”

Can the brothers actually get released?

Several attorneys think that their chances are good. Lovell pointed to new evidence that backed their sexual-abuse claims and “exemplary conduct” while incarcerated, such as mentoring other inmates and taking classes, as well as social shifts that take trauma into account. “Society’s view of sexual abuse has drastically changed from the time of the convictions, and the court will most likely consider today’s beliefs, as opposed to those present in the ’90s,” he said.

Cominsky noted that there are still many things that would happen before release. A short sentence, for example, is on the table. “That new, shorter sentence would ultimately lead to their release,” she said. “With a resentencing, the court only modifies the sentence; the conviction still stands.”

https://vulture.com,Is Lisa Barlow Leaving ‘Real Housewives of Salt Lake City’?,https://www.vulture.com/article/lisa-barlow-rhoslc-leaving-rumors.html,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 00:53:03 GMT","Photo: Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images for Vox Media

Lisa Barlow, the tequila connoisseur in a land of soda pops, has been spotted in a completely different state during the filming of the upcoming season of the Real Housewives of Salt Lake City. What’s going on? Is Barlow trading being a housewife for Ben Affleck movie promo?

Why did the rumors start?

At first, it looked like Barlow skipping out on big group trips on the show. Mary Cosby, Angie Katsanevas, Meredith Marks, Heather Gay, Whitney Rose, and Bronwyn Newport were spotted filming at hot springs in Utah over the weekend— without Barlow. It didn’t seem to ring any alarm bells until people began speculating on Barlow’s absence. On March 11, RHOSLC fan pages started claiming that Barlow removed the show’s name from her Instagram bio. Then, a parody page posted a fake statement from Barlow that read: “It was a long run! When life gives you real problems this reality shit doesn’t make sense. Peace out I’m out.” Barlow herself has been keeping quiet on the rumors. She’s been at SXSW for the past week, making herself royalty at another arts festival. Podcaster Up and Adam! claims that Barlow is holding out for a hiring paycheck from Bravo; he alleges Barlow is looking for a $1 million salary for this season.

So, is Lisa Barlow coming back?

It seems like she is. She was spotted filming with her husband by a fan in Salt Lake City on the same day the rumors were spreading. It looks like the queen of Sundance is here to stay and possibly got a pay bump. Sorry, Whitney and the other housewives Barlow feuds with— the rumors couldn’t even last a fourth night.",vulture

Soulja Boy’s former assistant is suing the rapper with allegations of rape, assault, and kidnapping in a lawsuit initially filed in California in 2021. The rapper, legal name DeAndre Cortez Way, headed into court this week in Los Angeles for the trial; opening statements will be shared “within days,” per a press release. The former assistant, a Jane Doe, says she began working for Way in 2018 for an agreed-upon wage of $500 a week. She claims once she began working for him, he sent her unsolicited, explicit photos. They eventually began a romantic relationship; however, she alleges the rapper was abusive, describing “kicking and punching and threats of violence and death” throughout their time together. “On one occasion, defendant Way punched plaintiff so hard in the head, she lost consciousness, only to wake up in a locked bedroom with no mattress, food or water,” the lawsuit reads. “On another occasion when plaintiff tried to quit and leave defendant Way, defendant Way locked her in a room for approximately three days against her will with no hot water until she was coerced into not leaving.” She claims she was not paid at all for any of the assistant work she did. Vulture has reached out to Way’s attorney for comment.",vulture

Elon Musk already has a lot of enemies — did he really need the country of Ireland coming after him too? Princess of Ireland Ayo Edebiri has posted that she received death threats in 2024 after Musk quoted a false news story claiming Disney was considering Edebiri to replace Johnny Depp in an upcoming Pirates of the Caribbean movie. “Just remembering when I got some of the most insane death threats and racial slurs of my life (idk if it’s the #1 moment, but for sure top 3) for a fake reboot of a movie I had never even heard of because of this man,” Edebiri wrote over a screenshot of Musk’s post from February 7, 2024. “LMAO. So not only is he double s**g h**l-ing fascist, he’s an idiot but anyway.” Musk’s quote-tweet read, “Disney sucks.” Edebiri’s post follows claims by Musk that he’s getting a lot of “flak,” including death threats, since speaking at Donald Trump’s first Cabinet meeting on February 26.

Earlier, Edebiri posted a screenshot of Bill Burr’s comments about Musk on NPR’s “Fresh Air.” “I’m trying to get regular people to stop yelling at each other and realize that it’s a select few group of nerds eating raw almonds and doing their stupid workouts and competing with each other to have the biggest infinity pool and the rest of us are getting pushed down,” Burr says in the screenshot. “They’ve politicized the whole stupid thing and we’re falling for it.” Edebiri then posted a screenshot of a friend telling her she would “eat” a Pirates update “up a lil bit,” which is true. Finally, Edebiri requested that news outlets “stop making my IG stories news” because “I’m just tryna have a silly goofy time.”",vulture

The Kelly Clarkson Show sets a clear expectation with its name. It’s a show hosted by Kelly Clarkson. But off and on for the past week, The Kelly Clarkson Show has aired without its namesake host. Clarkson was first absent on February 28 when comedian Roy Wood Jr. stepped in for her, simply sharing that he was there “to fill in for Kelly.” Actor Simu Liu guest-hosted on March 3, telling the audience he’d found out “about five minutes ago.” “Kelly actually isn’t able to make it today,” he told the audience. “We are sending her our very best.” Clarkson returned on March 4 and 5 with no details on her absence, but Wood was once again scheduled to host on March 6. She has been absent ever since — even missing her show’s thousandth episode on March 7.

Since Clarkson’s been gone, actor and model Brooke Shields and NBC anchor Willie Geist have also taken over her show. Singers Marc Broussard and Josh Groban have stepped up for Kellyoke with “Cameo-ke” performances. Model Molly Sims is slated to host the show on March 13 and 14, while actor Kal Penn is up on March 17. Clarkson is finally set to return on Tuesday, March 18 — though Andy Cohen of Watch What Happens Live! is taking the March 19 episode before she’s fully back on the couch.

On Wednesday, March 12, a hearing was held in a Manhattan federal court regarding ICE’s detainment of Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident of the United States and a graduate of Columbia University. A large crowd gathered outside the courthouse to protest the detention and attempted deportation of the Palestinian student activist leader, who is married to an American citizen. Among the crowd was Susan Sarandon, who gave a statement in solidarity with Khalil. “No matter where you stand on genocide, freedom of speech is an issue, is a right, that we all have,” she told reporters. “And this is a turning point in the history and the freedom of this country.” The Six Triple Eight actor has long used her celebrity platform to support leftist causes ranging from Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaign to climate-change action.

Marvel looks different in 2025. Captain America: Brave New World did okay at the box office, scoring $370 million, but it paled in comparison to the $1.15 billion earned by the previous Captain America installment. Plus, both Thunderbolts* and Fantastic Four are introducing new crews, which is always a risk (see: Eternals). So, it should come as no surprise that, as soon as Marvel can, it’s getting back to what it knows works: friendly neighborhood Tom Holland. Below, find all the information we know about Spider-Man 4, including its cast and new release date.

Okay … so Tom Holland is back?

Yes, Tom Holland is back. The man, whose 2024 is notable mostly because he started a nonalcoholic beer called Bero, will still be playing the teen. Luckily, even Peter Parker can still drink a refreshing can of Bero.

Who else is in the cast?

The first person confirmed to be cast is Sadie Sink, who will play a new role to the Marvel Universe, per Deadline. Sink is best known as the reason “Running Up That Hill” went so viral after season four of Stranger Things, though she’s also acted in prominent projects like The Whale. There’s no confirmation of whom she’ll play in Marvel, though some are theorizing her red tresses are being tapped to play Jean Grey (a.k.a. Phoenix), an X-Men character who was last played by Sophie Turner. If it’s not Jean Grey, Sink could very well be playing another universe’s version of Mary Jane, who is a redhead in the comics, though Zendaya’s MJ has brown hair in the current MCU. Otherwise, no casting is official, even Zendaya’s, though we do know that Destin Daniel Cretton (Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings) is directing.

When is the release date?

Spider-Man 4 is now slated to come out on July 31, 2026. It was previously set to hit theaters a week earlier; the new date gives it some more space from the July 17, 2026 release of Christopher Nolan’s The Odyssey, which Holland is also starring in. Both Spider-Man 4 and The Odyssey are expected to film in 2025, which makes this quite a year for the beer salesman. And if that isn’t enough, though his involvement hasn’t been confirmed yet, per THR, he’s been cast as Austin Butler’s in the upcoming film American Speed and is likely — though not confirmed — to appear in Avengers: Doomsday. We just hope he’s started practicing the art of not giving up information on press tours, because he has a lot of them coming up.",vulture
https://vulture.com,Do You Give a Stitch About Live-Action Stitch?,https://www.vulture.com/article/lilo-and-stitch-live-action-release-date-cast-details.html,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 13:20:00 GMT","Folks, get ready to watch an animated alien interact with real humans. Disney is making a live-action Lilo & Stitch, but, if you cast your mind back to the original, you may remember that one of the titular characters is a blue alien. In fact, half of the main cast is alien. It looks like the movie is using a “human disguise shield” bit for beloved alien bounty hunters Jumba and Pleakley because the photorealistic versions of them … well, see for yourself. Put on your lei and queue up “Hawaiian Rollercoaster Ride” for the cast, the release date, and everything else we know about the upcoming “live” action.

A live-action Stitch? Let’s see the trailer.

So yeah, this pretty much looks like a beat-for-beat retelling of Lilo & Stitch with a few new gags thrown in and a very cute live-action kid acting opposite a CG Stitch with realistic fur and a less-expressive face than the original. When Disney started doing these reimaginings with 2014’s Maleficent and 2015’s Cinderella, those movies seemed to have an artistic purpose on top of the obvious financial incentives, taking their original films’ classic iconographies and retooling them with 60 years of perspective. This, meanwhile, just has Stitch slamming a fridge door in Nani’s face while she recites the “Ohana means family” line. It’s bleak Pleak.

Who’s behind experiment 626 this time?

Marcel the Shell With Shoes On director Dean Fleischer Camp has been tapped to direct, according to Deadline. So the burden of making a live-action Stitch — who must somehow be believable as both blue dog and alien — lies with him. Jon M. Chu was in talks to direct in 2020. Originally, it was reported that horror writer Mike Van Waes would pen the script, but now Chris Kekaniokalani Bright will be writing it.

And the cast?

According to The Hollywood Reporter, Chris Sanders, returns as the voice of Stitch. Acting opposite the monstrous CG alien will be Courtney B. Vance, per The Hollywood Reporter. He will reportedly star as sunglasses-wearing social worker and former CIA agent Cobra Bubbles, and joins previously-announced cast member Zach Galifianakis. “But Vulture, who is he playing?” you ask. He’s none other than Dr. Jumba Jookiba, Stitch’s daddy and mad scientist. His fabulous sidekick, Agent Pleakley, will be played by Billy Magnussen.

The titular Lilo will be played by Hawaiian actress Maia Kealoha, making her film debut. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Sydney Elizebeth Agudong will play Lilo’s big sis/legal guardian Nani. Kahiau Machado was originally slated to play Nani’s love interest, David Kawena. Reportedly, however, after his past use of racial slurs on social media resurfaced, the part will now be played by Kaipot Dudoit. Tia Carrere, the original voice of Nani, will star as new character Mrs. Kekoa, while Amy Hill will star as new character Tūtū.

What’s Lilo & Stitch about again?

The OG L&S followed Experiment 626 (a.k.a. Stitch) as he fled the scientist who created him, got adopted by a girl in Hawaii, and fell for the stylings of Elvis. It also showed us all the meaning of ohana and taught Disney the meaning of toyetic. In the aughts, Stitch merch seemed like the backbone of the American economy. The little dude was everywhere: TP-ing Cinderella’s castle, getting a TV-show spinoff, and becoming big in Japan. The adaptation will be released directly to Disney+. Lilo & Stitch is the latest Disney classic to get the live-action treatment, something of a reimagining of the old Disney Vault model. Rather than rerelease Disney films every few years, why not completely remake them?

When’s the release date?

Surf’s up on May 23, 2025. Until then, there’s always the delightful 2003 animated series on Disney+.",vulture

Millie Bobby Brown, who is currently on the press tour for Electric State as Millie Bobby Blonde, did not mean to be a trad wife. She just … likes everything that goes along with it. Brown is the guest on the March 12 episode of Call Her Daddy, and in the episode, host Alex Cooper almost immediately asks her about the “trad wife” allegations that have been leveled at Brown on social media recently. “I understand why they would say that,” Brown, who lives on a farm with over 30 dogs, admits. “I have chickens, I get the eggs. I know what it looks like.” Plus, there’s the fact that she got married at just 20 to Jake Bongiovi. But still, she doesn’t necessarily see herself that way. “I love my job, I love being untraditional and unconventional in so many ways,” she claims, before admitting that she does, actually, always make dinner for her husband. “I cook every night,” she says. “This is the problem.”

Previously, she told the SmartLess podcast on March 10 that she really, really wants a family. “Jake was like, ‘We cannot do that until we get married,’” she said. “So that was his thing, and my thing was, I really want a family. I really want a big family. I’m one of four. He’s one of four. So it is definitely in our future.” Nara Smith, watch out.

Luckily, the group once again caught everything on film and is releasing a new documentary for its 41st anniversary. Spinal Tap II: The End Continues follows Nigel Tufnel, David St. Hubbins, and Derek Smalls as “one of England’s loudest bands” returns to the road, this time featuring performances with fellow legends like Paul McCartney and Elton John.

Read on for more Poker Face deets, from the new guest criminals to the first teaser trailer to the release date for these 12 “killer new episodes.”

Poker Face 2: Still Poking

Charlie Cale lives! The Peacock series, starring Natasha Lyonne and created by mystery man Rian Johnson, was renewed for a second season — four episodes before season one even finishes. “Poker Face is one of those rare, undeniable shows that we all fell in love with from the start, but the critical acclaim and viewer response has been beyond our wildest dreams,” Susan Rovner, NBCUniversal Television and Streaming’s chair of entertainment content, said of the renewal. The first season was packed to the brim with guest stars like Adrien Brody, Hong Chau, Lil Rel Howery, Cherry Jones, Chloë Sevigny, Jameela Jamil, Nick Nolte, and Stephanie Hsu. We’d kill to see Lyonne’s But I’m a Cheerleader co-star RuPaul or Rian Johnson’s Knives Out alum Toni Collette in season two. No b.s.

Who will guest-star on Poker Face season two?

We’ve been given a few more clues. This season’s guest stars include [deep breath] Adrienne C. Moore, Alia Shawkat, Awkwafina, Ben Marshall, B.J. Novak, Carol Kane, Cliff “Method Man” Smith, Corey Hawkins, Cynthia Erivo, David Alan Grier, David Krumholtz, Davionte “GaTa” Ganter, Ego Nwodim, Gaby Hoffmann, Geraldine Viswanathan, Giancarlo Esposito, Haley Joel Osment, Jason Ritter, John Cho, John Mulaney, Justin Theroux, Kathrine Narducci, Katie Holmes, Kevin Corrigan, Kumail Nanjiani, Lauren Tom, Lili Taylor, Margo Martindale, Melanie Lynskey, Natasha Leggero, Patti Harrison, Rhea Perlman, Richard Kind, Sam Richardson, Sherry Cola, Simon Helberg, Simon Rex, and Taylor Schilling. As evidenced by Lyonne’s Instagram, the gang shot #PokeyFaceRedux in July 2024.

What happens in the teaser trailer?

“This is getting crazy,” Erivo says. What, more crazy than her playing sextuplets this season? Apparently so. The 30-second teaser shows Charlie peeking out of a coffin, jumping away from an explosion in a store, and holding a cup that falls victim to a drive-by shooting and reminds her what she’s “running from.” Plus, we get previews of the stacked list of guest stars, from Mulaney as an FBI agent to Method Man as a guy who appears to be really struggling in the gym.

What else do we know about what Poker Face season two will look like?

In a joint statement, Johnson and Lyonne said that 12 killer new episodes will have Charlie Cale solving murder mysteries everywhere from “minor-league baseball to big-box retail, from funeral homes to alligator farms and even a grade-school talent show.” The duo noted that they pulled visual inspiration from American cinema in the ’70s that they love from the likes of Robert Altman, Bob Rafelson, and Peter Bogdanovich. “But the backbone of this show is TV — the kind of TV we grew up watching, episodic case-of-the-week gems like Columbo and The Rockford Files and Quantum Leap,” they added. “Each episode is a mini movie, existing in its own world with a unique tone and vibe, featuring an eccentric lot of characters played by a truly gonzo parade of guest stars.” Shuffle through the first-looks below to get a taste of what’s in the cards this spring.

We're so back! And that's no bullsh*t.

Five years ago, acclaimed documentarian Liz Garbus made her narrative film debut at the Sundance Film Festival with Lost Girls, an adaptation of Robert Kolker’s book of the same name about the women whose bodies were found on Long Island and unsolved case of the Long Island serial killer. “The film was about the surviving women — not about the sex work that these young women engaged in that ended up being how they were defined in their death. It was really about the family members and their search and their desire for justice. The living legacy of these girls was the love of their family members,” Garbus told Refinery29 at the time of the film’s release on Netflix in March 2020. With five years’ hindsight and a suspect arrested, Garbus returns to Netflix this March with a docuseries that goes back to the cold, swampy beaches of Long Island.

In both the feature film and the new documentary, Garbus is keen to avoid the traps of sensationalizing the nature of missing women as a point of lurid fascination, unwilling to blame or indulge in any victim-blaming on account of the women’s shared backgrounds in sex work. At the heart of this case is the story of misogyny as well as police indifference, incompetence, and ultimately corruption.

The series focuses on the piecemeal nature of the investigation but also the way in which the investigation was only advocated for by the families of the women whose bodies were found, a grieving sisterhood united in advocacy. Garbus also directed the docuseries adaptation of Michelle McNamara’s I’ll Be Gone in the Dark, explaining to Vulture at the time that, “the other important thing is not to endow the perpetrator with a point of view. Point of view is everything in filmmaking. When you give it, you’re giving power. It was a conscious choice to remove the power from the criminal’s perspective, which in this kind of story generally fetishizes women.” In turn, Garbus prioritizes the stories of these women — who they were outside this case and how those who loved them fought for them for decades — amid the violence and injustice they suffered.",vulture

Let’s say you’re running a little bit hot tonight. You can barely see the road from the heat coming off it … you reach down between your legs and ease the seat back … to get your pristine copy of 2006’s Strummin’ with the Devil, a bluegrass album of Van Halen songs created under the tutelage of David Lee Roth. The record is now a personal favorite for John Mulaney, who told Rolling Stone in a new interview that he, Bill Hader, Fred Armisen, and Jimmy Kimmel are in a group chat dedicated to gossiping about the hard rockers. “I like Van Halen a lot and I like Diamond Dave’s bluegrass album of covers,” he said. “I’m embarrassed to say, it’s kind of in my shuffle.” Of the quartet’s thread, Mulaney added, “interviews with Alex and Eddie Van Halen about David is the platonic ideal.” (Mulaney also has a separate group chat with Kimmel and Nick Kroll about Kiss, where they “mainly” trade thoughts about Gene Simmons’s questionable business endeavors.) Mulaney tried to get Roth as a guest on his Everybody’s in L.A. live show last year, but the vocalist rejected every idea presented to him, including being a bandleader. “I should just call him up and say ‘Let’s party,’ and he might show up,” Mulaney joked at the time.

This week’s observation that West and Jesse have absolutely no personal boundaries did not happen in their bathroom — though Lexi did get in there and share a shower with Jesse Solomon (always both names). That sounds like a good kind of boundary pushing, not whatever these two bros are up to. The incident still involved Lexi, however. After a long night of sharing a bed with his paramour, Jesse arrives back in his and West’s room, pauses for a moment, and lets out the sort of loud sputtering fart that you only hear in prank videos. He says after 12 hours of holding it in, he couldn’t wait any longer. Dude, you held it in for 12 hours, it wouldn’t kill you to let it loose in the toilet? Or better yet, take it outside. Maybe the backyard could smell like Jesse’s pent-up White Claw farts instead of the boys’ day-old urine for a change.

After this exchange, I don’t ever want to hear about Jesse gassing the girls up again because, well, I think we’ve had enough of Jesse’s gas. But this episode was about the relationships that everyone in the house is fostering, and since we’re already smelling Jesse, let’s get to him and Lexi, which may be stalling out. He said he went into this weekend thinking he would end up being exclusive with her, but now he’s facing some red flags. We also learn that she’s given him a month to decide if he wants to be exclusive with her or not, so he’s working on a timetable. I think this is a good strategy. Lexi is mature enough to essentially say, “I’m only going to have sex if we’re in a relationship, and you have a deadline to decide. If you can’t, then I’m moving on and not wasting any more time.”

While the deadline is good, Lexi seems a little too in her head about things. After they spend the night together, Lexi says she’s worried that everyone keeps saying Jesse is a boob guy. I think she’s sort of misinterpreting what happened at the beach, where all the girls were talking about how big their boobs are in relation to Lindsay’s, which are now bigger than ever thanks to, you know, human biology. They’re all joking about how Jesse would like those boobs less because they know Jesse’s into boobs and more because Jesse loves to flirt with the ladies, and it’s become a kind of gag amongst them. Ciara says explicitly what I think many of the girls in the house are feeling, they like clowning with Jesse, but none of them actually harbor any sexual feelings for him, which is what allows them to be so open.

I think these relationships are going to be hard for Lexi, considering her jealousy, but I also feel for her. She talks about how, as a model, her body is always being criticized, even as its also being exalted. So many of us at home see these gorgeous people with their perfect bodies on Instagram and think they have all the confidence in the world, but Lexi is obviously insecure about her smaller breasts, probably because she’s heard, point blank, at so many castings that she doesn’t have the bodacious tatas that some campaigns are looking for. But Lexi is obviously gorgeous and her body is absolutely perfect. Jesse has a wonderful moment with her in bed when he hears about this and reassures her that he’s into her and his intentions are good. He also tells her that he’s an ass guy, which, same, just different kinds of asses. If that’s true, then great, and if it’s not, it was still the perfect thing to say. A+ for Jesse Solomon and all his names.

Another relationship that came a bit under fire is Lindsay’s relationship with her baby daddy, Casper the Friendly Ghost. Danielle is shocked to learn that the two of them don’t live together and have no plans to do so. Lindsay doesn’t think it’s a big deal, saying, “He spends every night at my house anyway.” Okay, so … why not live together? I’m with Danielle; once the baby comes, he’s going to need to be up in her apartment all the time just to help her feed and care for that bundle of rushed relationship joy. His having his own place lets him say, well, he can’t say anything because he’s a ghost. But he can spell out on the Ouija board, “Oh, I had a hard day at work. I’m gonna stay at my place tonight.” No, he is not! Lindsay has been getting up every four hours to feed and change that child, and he is taking at least one of those shifts. Danielle is right; Lindsay does not need to be “single momming it,” while this specter could cross over to the other side at any time.

The contrast between Lindsay and Carl (RIP Larl) couldn’t be starker. As Paige says, “Carl became a priest, and Lindsay is pregnant with her third child.” This comes after Carl admits to not having sex in the year since he broke up with Lindsay. I really feel for Carl, who got sober during the pandemmy, started dating Lindsay, and is now trying to date and be sober for the first time. Jesse and West, hot off their newfound fame, both tell him that he could just walk out the door and fuck any girl he wants, but poor Carl can’t figure out how to meet a girl at a club and just start making out with her. It turns out that sober Carl is a bit of a dork. I don’t mean this in a bad way. Everyone should get themselves a hot nerd for a partner. Not only are they super appreciative of the attention, but they’ll never leave you, and most of them overcompensate for their awkwardness by being extremely proficient in the sack. It’s the whole package!

Our Carl could use an intervention. The green clogs are a perfect example. They’re not hideous; in fact, they could be very stylish, and I applaud Carl for taking a risk and trying to stand out by wearing something bold. The problem is those clogs were totally wrong for that outfit and made him look silly. This is a failure of both the girls and the boys. Paige, at the very least, should have gotten right in there and told him they were a mistake and styled him better. Really, any of the girls could have and should have helped. And the boys, well, they need to take Carl out and wingman that shit, not only in helping him with better footwear choices but by carefully guiding him toward figuring out the best way to talk to women in a way that he’s comfortable with. This guy hasn’t gotten any in a year, it’s gonna take a village.

Carl should not be taking either fashion or relationship advice from newbie Imrul, who wears a pair of white sunglasses with a shade on them that is so stupid they would be laughed out of a day rave on Staten Island. He opens up to the crew about how he was in the country illegally until he got married in his 20s. I loved that he said he learned that he could no longer be sexually monogamous and could be really open about that. I hated that he discussed his immigration status so openly. Dude, there are ten ICE agents staked out in every Stop and Shop up and down the eastern seaboard. Now is the time to be keeping quiet about that shit.

Imrul brought home his second lady in a row this weekend. Crazy enough, she has the same exact name as the girl he brought home last weekend, which is Janet, Ms. I Didn’t Sign a Release So You Can’t Show My Face If You’re Nasty. I bet producers are pissed about this whole arrangement, and I can’t decide if I should be or not. He’s gone on a reality show to share his life, a big part of which is shagging. Great, and he is sharing that. But everyone else on this show has dealt with bringing people home and showing the consequences. Look at how Kyle and Amanda were treated in the early years or all the footage of Lindsay hooking up with dudes. It seems like Imrul wants to have his cake and eat out every woman who won’t sign a release too.

Finally, we need to talk about the relationship that was the most strained in this episode, and that is Kyle and Paige. They have a very easy chat on the beach where my imaginary husband Kyle has never looked better. It’s like he just finished filming a reenactment of the Top Gun volleyball scene. (Focus, Moylan. Stop thinking of sweaty, shirtless Kyle.) Anyway, Kyle apologizes for putting Paige in the middle of his stuff with Craig and Hannah and adds that the relationship he was most concerned with was his and Paige’s as well as Paige and Amanda’s. That’s as sweet as all the Loverboy “non-alc” in the world, but where was that concern when the rage text started? How do we get Kyle to this place of zen understanding and bypass the anger it takes to get there?

Paige sweetly tells him that they will never not be friends, and she will make sure of that, but I would have added a bit more of an admonition against Kyle engaging in similar behavior again in the future. Our Paige is a little too kind. We see the same thing in her dinner with Craig at the very end of the episode where they eat kangaroo kebabs like they’re at Ashley Darby’s ill-fated Australian restaurant. Of course, we all know these two are headed for a bust-up, and it becomes even more clear when Paige tells him how excited she is to move on with her career and how excited she is to be busy, but Craig still wants her to move to Charleston, birth his babies, and make him sandwiches for lunch every day. That is clearly never going to happen, and Craig is struggling with his toxic masculinity that he is the submissive one in this relationship. And he should be! Look at him! He’s a liar who lives in a pokey town and only learned to dress in the last two years. She is Paige Motherfucking DeSorbo, and a better catch does not exist either on reality television or in the world. If he’s not going to accept that and rise up to her level, well, then he deserves to be alone in a room, clutching at his neck and gasping for breath, because the room is filled with weeks and weeks of Jesse Solomon’s pent-up flatulence.",vulture

Not that I’m complaining, but from the science fair to the winter concert, this season has been filled to the brim with kid-centric installments showcasing the adorable talent that makes up the “elementary” part of Abbott Elementary. Tonight is a welcome respite as the bleak reality of our piss-poor public education system often accompanies the school-heavy episodes. Our teachers deserve to let their hair down every once in a while, and this time, it’s Barbara who organizes a karaoke outing for the staff to do just that. Of course, Abbott’s queen of vocals would choose this as the off-the-clock activity for the crew, and thank goodness she did because the episode is packed with hilarious performances and plenty of after-hours behavior.

Music has always been an important element Abbott uses to set the mood and establish the specific corner of culture that the show honors, with the soundtrack boasting artists like Missy Elliot, Boyz II Men (gotta have Motownphilly!), Cardi B, The Jackson 5, and Jazmin Sullivan. Whether it be Ava queening out to Back That Azz Up, the students calling Lil Wayne’s “A Milli” an “oldie,” or the staff bonding during Wild Wild West line dance in that now iconic cold open, Abbott’s music selection has almost become a tertiary character of the show. The karaoke club outing takes Abbott’s love for using music to tell a story to the next level, with their song choices injecting ample comedy (Mr. Johnson needs to release a full version of “It’s Hard Out Here for a Pimp”) and sentimentality as the crew deals with their various relationship issues.

No kids means the adults no longer have the responsibility of being the ones holding everything together, so the episodes without the students tend to showcase the more vulnerable side of the characters. For Ava, whose armor often comes in the form of her fortress of an office and the knowledge that she’s the commander-in-chief, this manifests in her first date with O’Shon. After a season-long slow burn, the couple finally makes it out to dinner, but once outside of the school, their chemistry flatlines as Ava’s constant defensiveness erects a wall between them. At the restaurant, she swerves his attempts at connecting with constant sarcasm and cynicism, keeping things cooly surface-level if not slightly hostile (telling a guy he “giggles a lot for a man” isn’t exactly flirty).

O’Shon, a man who is clearly sure of himself and his desires, asks for the bill, cutting the date short, saying he doesn’t want to waste her time. Shocked, Ava tries to cover her tracks, saying she thought snarky rapport was their “thing,” but O’Shon expresses his desire for a deeper connection. As they wait for her ride on the curb, Ava takes a stab at letting her walls down, restarting one of the conversations O’Shon tried to start earlier by mentioning how her father used to take her to chain restaurants as a kid. Although these outings were once a fond memory, after her dad started a second family with one of the waitresses, Ava became resentful — well, that’s the mature interpretation of her words; she merely says, “Queso dips are very triggering for me now.” This display of vulnerability pulls O’Shon back in, who tells her, “I don’t really like queso dip anyways, so it won’t be hard to avoid on our next date.” Finally, Ava properly gets into the flirty energy, offering that technically their date doesn’t have to end yet, inviting him to karaoke … but not before making fun of his car, asking what divorced lesbian he got his Suburu from.

Ava and O’Shon take a second stab at their first date by heading to the club, where the rest of the teachers have been holding it down, getting increasingly inebriated while dealing with adult drama of their own. Although Janine’s ecstatic about her duet with Gregory — they’re going to sing “Always on Time,” and she’s been practicing her Ja Rule voice all week — she does her best to play the role of the supportive partner when he’s unable to make it until after logging a few hours as a rideshare driver. She spends most of the evening anxiously awaiting his arrival and moving their name further down the queue the longer it takes for them to get there. But, like the driven girl we know, Janine is emphatically optimistic and tries to make the most of the evening, even pushing Jacob to strike up a conversation with a cutie at the club named Elijah, played by comedian Jaboukie Young-White.

Following his breakup with Zach and the shortlived relationship with paramedic Avi, romance has been on the back burner for Jacob and it’s not until he runs into his ex at the karaoke club that he realizes how much he’s neglected his personal life. We haven’t seen Zach since the aftermath of their messy breakup, so when Jacob spots him at the club, hysterically laughing with a new love interest, he tries to avoid the inevitably awkward interaction. But after some encouragement from Melissa and Barbara, he summons the courage to talk to Zach, who reveals that not only does he have a new man and moved to his dream neighborhood, but he’s also there to celebrate the opening night of his one-man show “Got Out” (which is actually funnier than the original title that we got the PG version of last season, a.k.a. “Fleabag with an F”).

When Jacob has nothing else to contribute to this catch-up than “Melissa got a guinea pig,” he starts questioning his own decisions, falling into a self-pitying spiral. Through gritted teeth, he assures his coworkers he’s fine before snatching the mic and bursting into a rendition of Papa Roach’s “Last Resort” that should honestly win Chris Perfetti an Emmy and definitely changed my rating from four stars to five. The rage-filled performance pushes Barbara and Melissa to ask him why he’s so triggered. Jacob describes his feelings of envy towards the amount of things Zac has accomplished since the breakup, saying it makes him feel stuck. He lists some of his achievements, like helping RJ and getting the school a consulate, but Barbara points out that while those are amazing professional wins, there’s more to life than work. Invigorated by this advice, he courageously approaches Elijah, cleverly getting his number in a corny way that Jacob pulls off adorably.

While the party’s flowing at the karaoke club, Gregory moonlights as a rideshare driver in a characteristically meticulous way, with a carefully practiced welcoming speech, snacks, phone chargers, and “Gregory’s Goofy Games” to entertain the slew of eccentric riders he picks up along the way. But once Friday night surge prices spike to unprecedented highs and he’s tasked between accepting more rides or hurrying over to the club for his duet with Janine, he’s caught between his trademark pragmatism and his newfound romance. He calls Janine, gauging how upset she’d be if he ditched karaoke, but even as she tries her best to remain unaffected, encouraging him to take the rides, he can hear the disappointment in her voice. As the ride fare continues to rise incrementally, the always idealistic Janine determinedly tries to sing both parts of “Always on Time,” saying she has lots of practice as a “very lonely High School Musical fan.” But right as Janine takes a breath, preparing her diaphragm for a lengthy Ja Rule verse, Gregory bursts through the door, grabbing a mic and backing his lady up. Then, Ava and O’Shon arrive at the club, and the group bestows them with the privilege of choosing the very last song. Together, they pick “What Would You Do” by City High, with everyone joining in, validating Gregory’s decision to spend time with the chosen family we all love to watch.

Teacher’s Notes

• My favorite moment, perhaps of the whole season, was Ava meeting Zach’s new boyfriend. The interaction references Ava’s surprise at Jacob having a Black boyfriend, a moment that bred one of Abbott’s most famous jokes (“Actually, it’s pronounced Zach.”) Instead of exclaiming “Black?!” like she did when she first met Zach, this time she blurts out “White?!”, to which the new boyfriend responds, “It’s actually pronounced Wyatt.”

• I love Abbott’s side characters, Erika and Simon perfectly played that one toxic couple everyone knows. Also crossing my fingers for more Jaboukie!

• Finally, here are the funniest lines of the episode:

Ava and Barbara on Janine’s friend Erika coming to karaoke:

Ava: “I can’t believe you’re forcing your friend to throw it back on a district employee just so you can get back in their good graces.”

Barbara: “She’s welcome to come…as long as she does not throw it back, forward, or to the side.”

Jacob on why Zac turned down his mic: “He said my voice only worked in theory.”

Erika shit-talking Gregory: “You ask a lot of questions about me and my man, but what about yours? He still built like a Lego?”",vulture

I hate nothing more than being wrong, so I must admit that the Shot in the Dark turned out to be a halfway decent twist this week. After saying for a few seasons that it’s never used correctly and it doesn’t add anything to the game, it turned Tribal Council totally on its head. I have to admit when Jeff unscrolled the scroll and it said “SAFE,” I screamed a little bit in my living room.

While I was wrong about the SITD, this episode just proves to me that I’ve been right about everything else in the new era. This episode proved that all the things I (and plenty of other fans) hate about the post–Winners at War status quo created a crisis in the game itself, which led to one person on a tribe of four deciding who gets to go home. No one who believes in the integrity of the game and its ideology — that the tribe decides who wins and loses — should be onboard with these changes.

Let’s start with the first thing wrong, which is dividing everyone into three small tribes where, in almost every instance, one of those tribes is decimated. The episode starts with equal time for all of the tribes, but none of it really matters. Based on how much we saw of David in the recap and how much time was spent on him talking about how he lives in a trailer in his father’s front yard, it seemed for sure like he would be a linchpin to the whole episode. However, it’s all moot. (I will add that David needs to dump his girlfriend. He says if he doesn’t win $1 million so that she can be a stay-at-home mother of four kids, then she’s going to break up with him. She is more in love with some idealized, imaginary lifestyle than she is with David, the person, so even if he wins, he needs to show her the door. Even his friends think so!)

Similarly, everything we learn at Lagi (purple like the nerple) — about how Eva is throwing out Thomas and Bianca’s names, and they’re now gravitating closer to Star in order to get her out — is negated. We got another great moment with my doppelgänger Thomas where Bianca tells him that she lost her vote for him to then keep his advantage all to himself, but what little joy that brought me does not outweigh what seems like wasted time.

Both of these tribes are essentially moot. Why? Because Vulu (green with anything but envy) loses their third straight challenge, this one a Survivor classic where a caller has to guide their blindfolded tribemates through an obstacle course. They’re going to tribal again, and so it’s only the dynamics of their tribe that matter.

As the challenge ended, it was only halfway through the episode, so I knew something had to be going on because there was still a lot of episode left. There is a journey, of course, but even after the journey, the timing seemed off. Anyway, Lagi won and decides who goes on the journey, sending Bianca from their own tribe, Kamilla from Civa (orange you glad I didn’t say Civa), and Justin from Vulu. This brings me to problem No. 2, which is the new era and possibly my biggest complaint. The journey is a dice game with seven dice with skulls and flames on them. If the person rolls four skulls first, they lose their vote; if they roll four flames, they get an extra vote. Nothing on Survivor should ever be left to chance. Period. Players don’t even have a choice on whether or not they want to play. A puzzle I don’t mind because it requires skill. I also wouldn’t mind something else that challenges players’ morals or intellect, like whether they take a big bag of rice for the tribe or an extra vote for themselves. But this is just dumb luck and the thing about dumb luck is that it is dumb. Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.

Justin, who is going to the Tribal Council, loses his vote, as does Bianca, leaving Kamilla the only one with a victory and an extra vote. I might care if we ever got to spend any time at Civa, but we don’t because we’re always at Vulu being annoyed by Sai’s gameplay that is giving Rome 2.0. Justin also decides to keep his loss a secret and tells the tribe that he was rolling dice with different-colored question marks. Oh, wait, he’s from Boston. The dice had different-colored question mahhhhhhhhks.

The day before losing, Mary was running all around the camp, trying to get away from Sai long enough to find an idol. However, after their loss, she comes back and decides to take a swim to make it look like she may have an idol or some advantage. This was actually brilliant gameplay because Sai can only think of one way of playing the game, which is harder than JD Vance in a Jennifer Convertibles. “I can’t believe you’re giving up like this; something ain’t right,” Sai tells Mary, who just shrugs and tells her it is her time to go, and she has accepted it.

It seems like it’s working on Sai, who wants Cedrek and Justin to vote Mary and her to vote Justin so that if Mary has something and votes for Sai, then Sai is protected. The only problem is, Justin doesn’t have a vote. Justin was smart not to tell anyone, because if Mary figured out Sai would vote for Justin and she also voted for him, then Justin would go home.

However, when we get to voting, there is still a lot of episode left. There is no idol in play, so what, exactly, is going to happen with this here vote? As I said above, Mary plays her SITD and is safe. The SITD is chance, of course, but I don’t mind it so much because it is a chance the player opts into. Mary didn’t need to leave it up to chance, but she sacrificed something, her vote, and made a decision to leave it up to chance. Decisions and their consequences are great; just blindly rolling dice is boring.

Jeff reads the two votes, which are both for Mary. I was a little bit shocked that Sai hadn’t gone rogue and voted for Justin, because she does not seem like the type of player to listen to anyone else. Also, that there were only two votes should have been the first clue to Sai and Cedrek that something funky was going on. They go to revote, and as Sai approaches the podium, she says, “This is what happens when you trust boys.” I think that both Thomas and I can tell her, from bitter experience, that you should never trust a boy, especially a cute one.

Jeff reads the votes, and there is one for Justin and one for Sai. Jeff tells us that in the event of a tie, the tied voters can’t vote — but in this instance, since Justin has no vote, then Sai gets to vote, but she can only vote for Justin. That means Cedrek is essentially deciding if he wants to send Justin home with Sai or force another tie. They vote again, with Sai approaching the parchment and saying, “Cedrek is honestly the worst.” Cedrek votes for Sai again, probably because he knows that she hates him now. This is when things get complicated. Know how we know? Because Jeff goes from his vote-counting podium and sits back in his chair. Gather ’round, children, Grandpa Probst is going to tell you about the time his machinations broke the game. Oh, wait, that’s not how he’s framing it. He’s saying it’s “historic.” Yeah, well, the COVID-19 pandemic was historic, and look at how much all of us loved that.

Grandpa Jeff tells us that typically with a deadlock, the tribe would discuss and if they can’t come up with a decision on who to send home, they draw rocks. However, those with votes against them don’t draw rocks, and Mary is safe. So that means Cedrek would essentially be dooming his own game, which he should have figured out when he voted against Sai the second time. This means that Cedrek is the only person who decides who gets to stay or go.

This is what I hate about the new era: paralysis. Jeff wants us to think this is exciting because we don’t know what is going to happen, but the suspense isn’t for a good reason. It’s not because someone played an idol well, flipped the numbers, or figured out a loophole and voted differently than they said they would. No, we’re in suspense because we don’t know the deep parliamentary rules of Survivor about what happens when one person has lost his vote, one has given up a vote and been named safe by the SITD, and one person is a surgeon who wouldn’t know good gameplay if it stabbed him with his own scalpel.

Cedrek says he met Justin first, which makes it seem like he’s going to keep him even though the order in which they met seems to be almost as arbitrary as rolling skull dice. Then Sai makes the only good argument, which is that she has always told him the truth and that Justin lied to him about losing his vote. This seems to work, and Cedrek turns to Mary and Sai and says that he will make a decision based only on the stipulation that Mary and Sai can squash their beef and start working as a tribe.

This is foolish for several reasons. Cedrek just betrayed Sai’s trust not once but twice. Why would she ever work with him again? If Sai were smart, she would squash her beef with Mary by teaming up with her and getting rid of Cedrek. He put all his trust in Justin, so why not just boot Sai for good? Secondly, as we saw in the preview, they’re going to be switching tribes in the next episode, so the bargain he made for a stronger tribe is a complete wash. Now instead of having a loyal soldier in Justin, who would have been on his side for saving him, Cedrek now has Sai going to another tribe and telling everyone that Cedrek can’t be trusted. He’s essentially ruined his whole game after being painted into a corner thanks to a Kafkaesque set of rules that had to be written because there are too many twists, too many risks, too many people losing their votes, which is something that should never happen. We watch Survivor to be excited by the interpersonal dynamics, the blindsides that happen because of betrayals of trust, the reversals when someone chooses themselves over loyalty. All of that is exciting and human. What we don’t watch Survivor for is Jeff reading us the fine print, which is what we got tonight.",vulture

This is the way Temptation Island ends: Not with a bang (or, in Brion’s case, multiple bangs), but with a whimper. After the climax (badum, tsk) of episodes four through seven, the men seem to have found capacity in their hearts for introspection, so they stop vigorously thrusting into every girl that looks at them sideways. But the result of this means that this final batch of episodes feels pretty much like one long waiting room until the final bonfires. And when those meet-ups do happen, fans are left feeling like an exhausted mother confronted with a mess in the kitchen: Not mad, but disappointed. Let’s get into it.

Amiah pulls Brion aside to decline his date. In the last episode, he insulted her for not wanting to talk about rough sex, and on top of all that, she doesn’t really respect him for cheating on his girlfriend. I really respect this play — what’s the point in going out for frozen yogurt with a man who just wants to use you as a mirror for his own problems? As a result, there are a couple of shots of Brion alone eating a very sad Icee. It’s what he deserves.

The rest of the couples head out on their dates, where there’s a whole lot of making out. Ashley and Danny at a pottery wheel! Tayler and Yamen underneath a waterfall! Grant and Natalie near a beach! Kay and Tayler on a beach! Every day, we get closer to a mouth herpes outbreak taking down this entire show. Perhaps the most surprising moment on these dates comes when Grant wonders whether or not he’ll introduce Natalie to his daughter after the show. Excuse me? You’ve only ever introduced your daughter to two women, and the third will be … a 22-year-old you once took to a place called the “Temptation Haven”? When she was invited to take part in a two-week, filmed vacation, I’m not sure Natalie envisioned becoming a stepmother at the end of it.

It’s time for the final bonfire … before the final bonfire. Alexa remains steadfast in her love for her boyfriend, Ashley and Tayler remain steadfast in their hatred for their boyfriends, and Shante remains as confused as ever. When Shante watches Amiah turn down Brion, she’s disgusted by her boyfriend’s behavior. But, as he’s wont to do, Mark L. Walberg clocks her tea, asking her if she’ll have the same strength when Brion’s back in front of her. Spoiler alert: she won’t.

During the boys’ bonfire, Tyler and Grant get pissy upon seeing their girlfriends make out with other men, as if they haven’t been doing the same thing for the last two weeks. Meanwhile, things start to become clearer for Brion: He opens up about his rough childhood dealing with addiction, foster care, and abuse, explaining that he’s been seeking validation from other women. This absolutely helps put his actions into perspective, but it’s unfortunate that he had to embarrass his girlfriend on international television to come to that conclusion. However, the biggest surprise comes when Lino determines, in the most garishly colorful shirt I’ve ever seen, that he’s going to propose to Alexa! Yay! We love love!

It’s time for the final dates, and the singles asked to them are (mostly) no surprise: Yamen, Hashim, Danny, and Gio for the boys, and Natalie, Kay, Amiah, and someone named Nikki for the girls. Since we’ve never seen Nikki before, her final date with Lino is pretty much just planning his engagement with another woman. How fun for her.

The dates consist of whatever activities their tour company hasn’t already done on this show, plus an AirBnb villa rental for one night. There aren’t cameras in these bedrooms, but the fear of being caught in 4K didn’t stop these boys before, so why would it now? Some highlights from these dates include Hashim (unsuccessfully) trying to convince Shante not to immediately forgive Brion, Yamen, and Tayler sharing some steamy-hot pool makeouts, Ashley and Danny sharing some steamy-hot shower makeouts, Tyler and Kay sharing some steamy hot tub makeouts, Natalie and Grant eat mangoes as their final date, then go into yet another tent (Did production forget to budget for them?), and Amiah forcing Brion to sleep on an air mattress. These two ended up having some good banter, so I guess his goal of being platonically friends with women was achieved in the end?

After the final dates, the boys and girls meet for one final time. Brion is ready to apologize, Tyler is going to break it off, Lino is going to propose (hopefully not in that knit tank top), and, of course, Grant doesn’t know what the hell he’s doing. Some things never change!

First to the final bonfire is Shante, who’s wearing the revenge dress to end all revenge dresses. Unfortunately, this sentiment is watered down by the fact that she immediately hugs Brion as he cries about his threesome. Mark L. Walberg explains the rules: First, each person can share their uninterrupted sentiments, then they can have a back-and-forth, and then decide the future of their relationship. This is the first of four times you’ll have to hear Mark L. Walberg say this.

Brion and Shante start off by saying what we already know: Shante’s hurt and Brion’s sorry. She then asks if he crossed any other lines besides the threesome, and he says no. Excuse me, what about calling Amiah “weird” because she didn’t want to discuss your love of rough sex? That’s weird to me! Later on, Mark prompts Brion to bring up what he learned from his childhood. No matter the outcome of his relationship with Shante, this is one good thing: Brion realizes that he needs a proper therapist, not just the unlicensed Mark L. Walberg. (Sorry, Mark!)

When it comes time to decide, Shante teeters off into the grass on the tiniest high heels and talks to a producer. When she comes back, Shante seemingly wants to be single, saying she needs to choose herself. However, when confronted with Brion’s layered apologies and man-tears, Shante folds. She’s leaving the island with him. After hearing her half-hearted rebukes at the previous bonfires, this is what we — and Brion — knew would happen all along. He can give into temptation and get away with it.

The beauty of Temptation Island is that adulterers are supposed to get their just desserts. Your every move is captured by hundreds of cameras. If you mess up, your partner will see it and immediately have the opportunity to take revenge with someone new. But in Shante and Brion’s case, that didn’t happen. Shante went on Temptation Island to see if her partner was truly faithful and chose to stick her head in the sand when she learned that he wasn’t. It’s a deviation from the natural order of Temptation Island, which is why this ending is particularly disappointing.

Luckily, the next two couples follow the formula to a tee. Next up are Tayler and Tyler, who social distance from each other like it’s March 2020. Tayler has prepared a memorandum of every way Tyler has messed up. Tyler, meanwhile, is stuck on the fact that Tayler said that he has “bitch tendencies” and uses it as his excuse to make out with Kay all over the island. In this environment, it’s more clear than ever that their differences are fundamental: He’s not ready to get another job, while she desperately needs stability. He wants someone soft and supportive, while she’s the master of tough love. She’s found her confidence in herself; he’s found his confidence in someone else. Tayler chooses to leave alone, while Tyler opts to bring Kay with him. It’s reflective of exactly who they are.

Then it’s time for Grant, who is rightfully “scared shitless” of this conversation, and Ashley, who would literally rather be anywhere else other than here. Grant uses Ashley’s words as his excuse to cheat but laughably forgives her; in response, Ashley metaphorically body slams him into the wooden bleachers, calling him a “serial cheater” who couldn’t even be faithful for three business days. As Ashley points out, their relationship was over the moment they separated, so this conversation is relatively short: They’re better off apart than they are together.

However, Grant has a surprisingly insightful moment when he chooses to leave the island alone rather than take off with 22-year-old Natalie; he needs time to be alone for a while. This is the right call: Don’t let the viewers — and especially his daughter — have expectations that they’ll be a couple post-show. Meanwhile, Ashley whisks her 22-year-old, Danny, off for some more island smooches. Hey — it’s not like she has a kid! Perfect Match season three, here she comes!

Finally, the Lino-Alexa engagement has come to lift our spirits from this sad, sad finale. Harry Styles Lookalike Contest Fourth-Placer Lino enters with his shirt unbuttoned and a pearl necklace on. When they see each other, Lino and Alexa immediately hug and kiss and tell each other that they’ve gotten over their respective insecurities. Obviously, they choose to leave the island together, but … where’s the engagement? Naturally, it’s next to the parking lot, where producers have hidden thousands of flowers and candles!

Lino gives the speech that he practiced on Nikki. Alexa says yes and cries. Amid a somewhat soft ending, Lino and Alexa remind us that it only takes 24 sexy singles to find the One. And isn’t that what Temptation Island is all about?",vulture

Because once Grant makes out with Natalie, any “rules” that they may have been following were thrown into that very picturesque ocean. The floodgates have opened.

I sound like Lana from Too Hot to Handle, but this is a bit much … right? Did the Challengers wind that makes you cheat just roll through? Or did the boys just get the Severance chip and completely forget about their significant others?

The worst part is that it really doesn’t seem like these men regret their adultery since it’s all in the name of figuring out their preexisting relationships. Or worse, they twist their girlfriends’ words from the first bonfire to make them feel better about cheating. I was rooting for some light adultery in the last recap, but upon further reflection, I’d like us all to repent and go back to church, please.

In the midst of all of this pent-up sexual frustration, Mark L. Walberg tells the couples it’s time to trim the fat from this island and eliminate two singles per villa. The girls cut Quinten, who had previously gone on a date with Alexa, and Erik, a man whose only real plus is his frosted tips. Also, Case crashes out and decides to self-eliminate for some reason. He comes back two episodes later and is never heard from again. This house is a convoluted maze of abs and creatine.

Meanwhile, boys get rid of Reba, who I’ve literally never seen before in my life, and Mia, the FBoy Island alum who had to (a) take on the role of Lino’s therapist and (b) in the same breath, hear him declare that she’s just not his type. Mia needs to hop on a boat and head back to FBoy Island — clearly, her captain got lost at sea and took her to the wrong beachfront villa. Reboot THAT, Netflix!!!!!!! I’m begging you!!!!!!

Those four are immediately replaced with sexy new singles — Daries, Ladimore, Daria, and Angel — who are dropped into the show in increasingly ridiculous ways. First, the boys are the girls’ painting “models,” then Daria and Angel come, pretending to be wait staff at a Mexican restaurant. Rightfully, Brion is concerned if this ruse has messed with their chips and guac. (It hasn’t, thank God.)

At the bonfire, the boys get more ammo for their twisted mind games when they see their girlfriends doubting their relationships. But the real fireworks (or lack of) come when Ashley sees that Grant had sex with another woman. Upon seeing this clip, she silently sits there, without crying. For a woman who tears up at just about everything, Ashley definitely wasn’t surprised. And although she went on television to find out if her boyfriend was loyal, it seems like Ashley knew the answer all along.

Tayler also gets a shock upon seeing her clip, which shows Tyler cuddling with Kay and admitting that his relationship is probably over. It hits a chord — she has abandonment issues, which cause her to tearfully utter, “I’d probably leave me too.” Oof. But this is where consummate pro Mark L. Walberg comes in. “You’re believing a lie!” he proclaims. If Mark L. Walberg told me to get my shit together in a booming voice, I probably would, too.

Of course, Mark L. Walberg isn’t done yet. He’s introducing a twist called the “Temptation Haven” — a tent in their yards where there are no cameras, but plenty of microphones! Only problem is, an alarm goes off in the other house when someone enters it. That way, the psychological torture can happen live, while the act is happening. Genius!

The first couple to take advantage of the so-called “Haven” (which is actually just a smaller version of the Weasleys’ tent from Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire) is Tyler and Kay, whose passionate makeout confirms that the mics are, indeed, on. Then it’s Natalie and Grant’s turn, who clearly aren’t bothered by the tent’s already broken-in mattress.

But Brion won’t be outdone because this is when he gets his threesome on! I’m sorry — where are the cameras in this bathroom? You mean to tell me we watched Natalie throw a sloppy handprint on the shower wall a few days ago, but now I can’t see exactly what the subtitles mean by “wet slapping”? Perhaps it’s for the best. The next day, Brion tells cameras he’s “still respecting Shante” despite cheating on her with multiple women, which is more off-putting than any sex scene could be.

As Angel rightfully points out the next day on their date, Brion is full of contradictions. He wants a woman that’s in church every Sunday, but will also participate in (or at least permit) threesomes. He’s into polyamory, but also wants to come home to the same person every night. He wants to strengthen his relationship with Shante, but balks at Angel’s deep questions. This man has a lot of growing to do, and Temptation Island might not be the place to do it.

Another man full of indecision is Grant, who seems to bounce back and forth from hooking up with Natalie to missing Ashley. He hates seeing Ashley with other men, yet doesn’t hesitate to kiss Natalie whenever it feels nice. Grant doesn’t see his relationship as fully over, despite cheating on her multiple times. While Tyler seems to, at the very least, understand his relationship must be done, Grant wants to have his cake and eat it, too.

Back at the ladies’ villa, Ashley and Tayler have deemed themselves officially single, so they start making moves. Tayler asks out life-of-the-party Yamen, who is finally getting the screen time he deserves. After Ashley and Danny’s “sensual embodiment” date — which consisted of two nearly-hairless people holding each other — the two set off the “Temptation Haven” alarm but don’t kiss. They quickly rectify this the next day.

In the middle of all this, Alexa and Lino remain pretty steadfast in their commitment to each other (except when Lino occasionally gets the urge to cheat and flirts with Alex, who turns him down every time). This should be a lesson for future Temptation Islanders: The least controlling couple is actually coming out the strongest.

Meanwhile, Shante has pretty much walled herself off from male touch or connection. She writes to Brion in her journal and even paints “I Love Brion” onto the shoulder of dual-sport Princeton grad Hashim. At the next bonfire, she finally finds out about the infamous threesome, but her reaction is flat. After crying at a Temptation Haven alarm being set off, Shante doesn’t shed a tear when her boyfriend gets involved in some “wet slapping” with two other women. (Sorry, I had to repeat that.) She even starts making comments that hint at her eventual reconciliation with him: Shante doesn’t believe Brion is a bad person since he wouldn’t have done that in the “real world.”

So, here’s my question: What isn’t real about cheating on your girlfriend while being filmed for the largest streaming service in the world? Shante had wanted to show this series to her children as an example of Brion’s faith, but that’s gone up in flames. She refuses to reconcile the man who’s gone on Temptation Island with the future father of her kids, and it only makes for a confusing, embarrassing mess. Just like Ashley, Shante refuses to make Brion’s cheating a dramatic moment for the cameras—whether that’s because she wasn’t surprised or because she doesn’t want to make a bad situation worse, I don’t know. But at what point is it enough?

Everyone has narrowed down their options to two or three singles, so Mark L. Walberg makes the couples thin the herd again. The girls send home four boys so nameless that they didn’t even get goodbye confessionals, while the boys’ group of eliminees includes Courtney, a.k.a. one-third of the threesome. She’s confused, and I get it — if group sex can’t keep you around, what can?

The couples now get to send a brief, 30-second video message to their significant others — or not. They have to hike out to a rock and open a box with an iPad in it to watch in the beating-hot sun. This is not the ideal set-up. Starting off strong, Lino and Alexa confess their undying love for each other, which includes Lino’s banger of a line, “Please remember there’s only one me, and I’ve realized there’s only one Alexa.”

Meanwhile, in Grant’s video, he blames all his cheating on Ashley but says he “forgives” her at the same time. This makes no sense to me or to Ashley, who doesn’t send a response. Tyler sent an equally confusing video, telling Tayler he loves her but saying nothing about his emotional affair. When confronted with Tayler’s silence, Tyler immediately runs into Kay’s arms. Sometimes men are very predictable.

After Brion gives a watered-down apology, Shante tells him that she’s really and truly hurt by his actions. Upon hearing this, Brion cries for the first time all season. In more ways than one, the floodgates have opened — and it’s far too late to stop the swell.",vulture
https://vulture.com,Temptation Island Season-Premiere Recap: I Saw Goody Grant With The Devil,https://www.vulture.com/article/temptation-island-premiere-recap-episodes-1-3.html,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 14:00:49 GMT","Temptation Island Bring on the Temptation/Testing the Waters/Playing with Fire Season 1 Episodes 1 - 3 Editor’s Rating 2 stars * * Previous Next » « Previous Episode Next Episode » Photo: Netflix

In many ways, it seems like the Temptation Island reboot — which just debuted on Netflix after more than two decades on Fox and USA — is primed to be a hit. It takes Netflix’s reality mainstay The Ultimatum and strips it back to basics, reminding fans that we’re all horrible people because we’re rooting for couples to cheat on each other. The Spanish iteration even just had a major viral moment with Montoya, a man whose flair for the dramatic is so intense that it transcended language itself. But unfortunately, that clip may have given newer viewers (like myself) expectations that simply couldn’t be matched.

A brief history lesson: America’s Puritan roots have caused television to be far more censored than many other countries’ programming, even in the age of streaming. From 1952 to 1983, the Television Code prohibited profanity, a negative portrayal of family life, sex, and even the negative portrayal of cops from airing on TV; even now, television nudity remains rare, aside from the classic example of HBO. Meanwhile, in Europe, we’re ogling full cock and balls on Naked Attraction.

The Temptation Island reboot is no different: In the first few episodes, the couples are reluctant to break the promises they made to their significant others, so the biggest blow-up stems from Kay giving Tyler a fully-sober, lights-on lap dance. If you go into this season of Temptation Island expecting to see Montoya’s ex humping her way to a break-up, don’t get your hopes too high.

Still, the series hits all the high points that veteran fans have come to know and love. In some aspects, it’s been stream-ified — the slow-motion shots of the singles are over-the-top and glamorous, while the cast appears to be varying levels of influencers-in-training. The signature chime that viewers hear during the Temptation Island title card even signifies that this is part of the NRTVU (Netflix Reality Television Universe).

But in many ways, it’s the same old TI, from the beachfront villa to the consistent format to longtime host Mark L. Walberg, who appears to have been given grey hair from two decades of therapizing adulterers. Let’s get into it.

In the first few episodes, fans are introduced to four couples — Brion and Shante, Ashley and Grant, Tayler and Tyler, and Alexa and Lino — all of whom are at a breaking point in their relationship. Pretty much all of the women are ready to be settled down, steady, and committed, while the guys are just … not. Grant cheated on Ashley one month into their relationship and she’s never quite gotten over it. Brion did the same thing, plus he won’t shut up about wanting to have threesomes. Tyler is jobless and immediately jumped into this relationship after his divorce. Lino still feels like a second choice because Alexa was dating two guys at the beginning of their relationship. (Are we not calling that cheating…?)

The answer to all of this? A herd of sexy singles, of course!

The singles are Glamazons, marching into Mark L. Walberg’s field with all the confidence of someone who’s never wondered if their hairline is thinning. Some producer ordered a 48-pack of corded black bracelets on Amazon, so each single gives a bracelet and innuendo to their contestant of choice. Some highlights include, “I used to be a cheerleader, so I’m not afraid to be tossed around,” “I hope your Thanksgiving is your favorite holiday because I’ll be serving all the yams,” and the poetic, “My guilty pleasure is sucking dick.” The girlfriends aren’t happy about this, but unfortunately, they can’t do much more than insult the single girls’ dye jobs. (Hey, that’s my thing!)

It’s time for the couples to say goodbye, which cues up the waterworks. Now’s a good time to go over boundaries: All of them bar physical intimacy besides Alexa and Lino, who don’t have any rules. (Can you see where this is going…?) Also, did I mention that Grant has a daughter watching at home that he wants to make proud? This is a recipe for disaster.

After a night of journaling, crying, and Grant wailing on the guitar he inexplicably brought, the ex-couples choose their first dates, which are as follows:

Alexa selects Quinten, who is 36 years old. At what point do we age out of things like Temptation Island and get a 9-to-5? Apparently, 36 is a perfectly acceptable age to fuck off to Hawaii for 2-4 weeks in the pursuit of “love.”

Tayler asks Chris, the personal trainer who would “love to stretch you ladies out.” Smart move on her part.

Shante picks Hashim, a dual-sport Princeton grad and one of the many self-described “teddy bears” on this show.

Ashley picks a 22-year-old named Logan. I wonder what he and Quinten talk about.

Lino selects Natalie, who looks like the human version of a TikTok filter.

Tyler picks Courtney to spite Tayler, who thought he was going to pick someone blonde. Just give him time, Tayler!

Brion picks Amiah, the girl who did a dance in place when introduced to the couples.

Grant picks a blonde woman named Olivia. Please don’t come for Tyler’s job.

There’s not much room for temptation on these first dates, considering they’re put on in massive groups. The boys go on a boat while the girls dance in a hula show. Back at the guys’ villa, the single girls are popping champagne in lingerie, as I am wont to do on a Tuesday night. Side note: For fans of the chronically underappreciated reality series FBoy Island (hosted by the fabulous Nikki Glaser), Mia was one of the leads! Oh, how the mighty have fallen. She starts directing a sexy game involving strawberries and body shots — because she knows exactly how this song and dance goes — and ends up licking chocolate off Brion’s neck. Somewhere, Mark L. Walberg just woke up in a cold sweat.

The next morning, the ex-couples are — as Kylie Jenner once said — Realizing Stuff. After Grant cheated on her, Ashley doesn’t think she’ll ever be able to trust him. Alexa wants to feel independent and confident after jumping from relationship to relationship. Brion wants a threesome. If you ever need to write a paper on the psychology of men, Temptation Island is assigned reading.

The producers decide that not enough scandalous things have happened, so the single guys and girls are tasked with doing some sexy dances. Amiah and Melissa do a choreographed routine that reads like you and your elementary school bestie begging your parents for a sleepover with a talent show. Here’s where we start to get some single standouts: Natalie teases Grant about his dancing and twerks for him, while Kay gives Tyler that aforementioned sober grind sesh. (Just as Tayler predicted, she’s blonde.) Tyler is tempted enough by this that he takes Kay on a “room tour.” Tyler, Kay isn’t interested in your bare-ass AirBnb walls — she’s interested in your bare ass.

The next day is the first bonfire, where Mark L. Walberg gets to flex everything he learned in his Foundations of Marital Therapy class last year. The boys see their girlfriends venting about everything wrong in their relationships, save for Shante, whose dancing clip gives the vibe of someone who’s thinking about making an excuse to leave the club early. Tyler seems to be the most hurt by his video, which shows Tayler saying that she buys the groceries while he leaves the toilet seat up. These seem like pretty easy fixes to me, but in Temptation Island, they’re all the permission that Tyler needs to start flirting with a certain tall blonde.

Meanwhile, the girls get hit with some atomic bombs. Shante is once again subjected to Brion’s threesome obsession, while Tayler watches Tyler get a dance from Kay and tell her that she’s trouble. On the surface, this doesn’t seem too bad — until Tayler says that these were the exact words Tyler said to her before they shared their first kiss. The lack of creativity in this line only adds insult to injury.

After the bonfire, the couples overanalyze their clips with the singles, who seem to only exist to help these people unpack their relationships. A couples’ counselor might be more convenient, but this works too! Tayler says Tyler has “bitch tendencies” (I laughed, sorry), while Ashley wonders why she’s even here if Grant’s questioning their relationship. In the other house, Grant’s doing a bit more than questioning: He and Natalie have an extremely sexy staring contest in the dark. The loser has to have a threesome with Brion!

The next day, the couples are tasked with asking different singles on dates. Here’s the B-team:

Grant picks Natalie, the 22-year-old he’s been eye-fucking for 24 hours.

Ashley selects the mulleted Danny, who is also 22 years old. When Grant does it, it’s weird; when Ashley does it, it’s chic. I don’t make the rules!

Tyler writes a note to Kay that unfortunately looks like a toddler wrote it.

Tayler asks out Cody, a guy who just revealed to the group that he likes his ass eaten.

Shante selects a man I’ve never seen before in my life. I later learn his name is Gio.

Brion swipes Courtney from Tyler.

Alexa selects another unknown, a guy named Max who has the worst case of hat hair I’ve ever seen.

Lino asks out Alex, who’s also been flirting with Brion. Keeping track of all this?

For these dates, the groups are cut in half — Tyler and Brion are bowling, Shante and Ashley are driving ATVs, Grant and Lino are doing partners’ yoga, while Alexa and Tayler are stuck wading into some knee-high water. As punishment to their men for this half-hearted date, Alexa and Tayler spend their entire date talking about their boyfriends. Gotcha!

Meanwhile at partners’ yoga, Grant and Natalie have snuck away to a rock for some alone time. Grant has basically decided that a clip of Ashley crying about their relationship is all the permission he needs to start macking on Natalie. They furiously make out. This is the first time a member of one of the couples has explicitly broken their rules, and the dramatic needle drop signifies that it won’t be the last. In all our Puritan glory, Mark L. Walberg’s cameras are there to capture it all. I saw Goody Grant sucking face at the kissing rock!",vulture
https://vulture.com,Daredevil: Born Again Recap: The Right Thing to Do,https://www.vulture.com/article/daredevil-born-again-recap-episode-3.html,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 02:00:02 GMT","For Matt Murdock, defending Hector Ayala is about more than just helping someone he believes is innocent. It’s about sticking it to the dirty cops at the NYPD, sending a message to them and Mayor Fisk that this city will not stand for corruption — that sometimes vigilantism, while an imperfect solution to a systemic problem, may sometimes be a necessary corrective when no other form of justice can be found.

Episode three is another court-heavy episode, the second half of a story that began last episode. Officer Powell, whom many viewers thought Matt straight-up killed in Nicky’s apartment, is already back to witness tampering and accusing Matt of interfering with a police investigation. It’s a little hard to take his threats too seriously when we just saw the legendary beatdown that left him unconscious and bloody on the floor, but the police shouldn’t be underestimated, especially with Commissioner Gallo in Fisk’s pocket. During Powell’s testimony, he and District Attorney Hochberg paint the late Officer Shanahan as a great, upstanding man who just wanted to make the city a safer place to live.

Instrumental to Hector’s defense is key witness Nicky, whom Cherry has secured at a safe house with enough drugs to keep him calm for his big moment. On the stand, Powell denies knowledge of any confidential informant, and some overheard murmurs from the cops on the benches confirm to Matt that they will not allow Nicky to take the stand easily. It takes some crafty maneuvering for Cherry to get Nicky to the courthouse in one piece, driving a decoy to throw Powell and the others off the scent. But after making it there just in the nick of time (no pun intended), Nicky ultimately caves to the pressure of the admittedly scary NYPD. He admits to becoming a CI after an arrest for dealing drugs, sure, but he denies leaving home on the night of the subway attack. It’s easy to understand Matt’s anger and frustration in this moment; with no paper trail, where can the defense even go from here?

The only option, really, is to put Hector on the stand. Kamar de los Reyes did a great job introducing this character in “Optics,” and he’s even better this time, imbuing an important comic character with real humanity. It’s easy to see why his testimony strikes a chord with the jury, including the detail that he’d been planning to surprise his wife with a new studio apartment in the South Bronx that next day. But what really seals the win for the defense is Matt’s risky choice to expose Hector as White Tiger despite actively suppressing that information last week.

Matt’s own vigilante double identity plays into this, of course, and his conversation with Hector following this dramatic moment is a highlight of the episode. When Hector insists that he’ll always be White Tiger and that he could never truly retire that identity even if he hung up the suit, it shows that he’s clearer-headed about that duality than Matt. Then again, Matt also has a point when he suggests that Hector should be there for his family at this time, that he might actually enjoy his life more as Hector Ayala.

There is a slight corniness to the series of grateful court testimonies that follow, a scene that feels a little more “yay, superheroes!” than the old Daredevil usually got. Or maybe I’m just a little resistant to the police glorification strategy Matt and Kirsten use: showing the jury that Hector saves cops, actually, and even helps them arrest suspects. After some pushback from Hochberg, the acquittal comes through, and it’s very inspirational. Of course, the end of the episode shows that this was never going to end well: Fisk is privately and publicly furious with the verdict, and he must stick to the anti-vigilante promise on which he ran for mayor.

So when a newly released Hector takes to the streets once again as White Tiger, someone with a Punisher skull on their T-shirt comes out of nowhere to shoot him in the head. Over the credits, we hear the sound of coquí frogs whistling over the wash of waves, perhaps a suggestion of what Hector heard as he died, memories of the home he never got to see again. Matt assured him he’d be back on those beaches one day.

Hector’s death definitely raises the stakes of the season, connecting this mini-arc to the larger Fisk story that has otherwise stayed separate from Matt’s recent work. It also keeps with the original show’s dark, realistic tone, though part of me wishes we didn’t have to lose such a likable new character so soon.

Fisk’s story in episode three is also interesting-ish, though it still mostly feels like setup until that big moment with White Tiger. He and Vanessa are still disagreeing about how exactly to handle the various criminal factions they’re allowing to run loose in Red Hook; Vanessa has her own ideas, like laundering money through expensive painting sales, but Fisk is insistent on prioritizing his more ambitious goals and staying clean, or at least his version of clean. To him, it’s not worth getting involved with the petty squabbles of Luca and Viktor; they’ll kill each other, and Fisk will be better off for it. But Vanessa orders Buck to deliver the message of what Luca owes to Viktor, which only exacerbates the tension between her and her husband. He even suggests he’s starting not to trust her, though she insists what he’s really doing is punishing her for sleeping with someone else.

I’m intrigued by these marital spats and curious if it could lead to Vanessa breaking from Fisk and taking control. But I agree with him, in a way: It’s hard to get super invested in the lower-level criminal schisms at this point. Episode three has plenty to recommend, especially in the Hector story, but I have to admit I’m a little impatient for the action to kick in, or at least to see Matt and Fisk come in direct contact again, or at least to see Matt’s pro-vigilante defense extend to accepting that he’s Daredevil already and stop limiting his powers to the courtroom. Daredevil works as a legal drama, but it’s at its best when the heroes get in the muck.

Devil in the Details

• Outside a brief glimpse of Heather in a session with Fisk and Vanessa, she mainly appears in one scene here, toasting to Foggy Nelson after Matt reminisces about his old best friend. It’s a nice conversation, folding her a little more into the show’s deep history, though I still think this relationship happened a little quickly.

• Maybe part of my slight dissatisfaction comes from the loss of directors Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead, who made that first episode look and sound so good. Visually speaking, these last two episodes have paled a bit in comparison. Kudos on the credits sound mixing, though, which is an inspired touch.",vulture
https://vulture.com,Deal or No Deal Island Recap: Snakes and Eels Everywhere,https://www.vulture.com/article/deal-or-no-deal-island-recap-season-2-episode-10.html,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 02:00:02 GMT","In a game like Deal or No Deal Island, it’s never enough to go after what you want — you have to be good at convincing others that what you want is also what they want. Without a tight grip on your priorities, you’re liable to get swept up in someone else’s strategy only to get spat back out whenever it best suits them.

I’m still trying to decide if that happened to Phillip, who went home this week in vexingly predictable fashion. On one hand, I do think he trusted Australian Survivor champ David Genat when he shouldn’t have. On the other, it’s also plausible that Phillip simply weighed the odds and decided to walk away with a guaranteed consolation prize.

We’re into the Final Five, which means, as Phillip put it, there are “snakes and eels everywhere.” He and Lete have played pretty honest games, but everyone else has been in Machiavellian mode. David still has everyone but fellow Survivor deity Parvati Shallow convinced that he’s just a regular guy from Australia. Parv has gone full Black Widow. And C.K. Kim is telling everyone what they want to hear — promising David and Parv that she’ll take Lete out first chance she gets while also telling Lete that David and Parv, the last vestiges of the once-powerful alliance “The Family,” are her main targets. In this treacherous jungle, no one can be trusted.

Two people had to go home this week, so everyone was scheming. David sidebarred with Phillip to say it was their “time,” not Parvati’s, and they promised to take each other to the end. C.K. promised everyone the world, and everyone half-believed her. Parv wondered if it was time to take out David. So much for a happy family!

This week’s excursion, “The Banker’s Fire Pit,” was a test of priorities. Each player had to hold a bag of money above a burn pit. The sacks were calibrated to weigh one-quarter of each player’s weight. Whoever held on the longest would automatically win $75,000 to take home, even if they lost the game. At the same time, our host, Joe Manganiello said, players had to watch as our case models opened a bunch of cases with randomly assigned values. To claim a case, they had to burn their money.

Whoever secured the highest-value case won automatic immunity. If two players dropped their bags for the same case, they split its value. The two players with the lowest value were automatically at risk to face the banker, and even worse, the winner would send the other one home immediately — no banker, no passing go, no collecting $200. And with that, it was time to find out who’s been skipping arm day.

Going into the game, only Phillip seemed to be considering the $75,000 and the “stability” it could give him. Everyone else wanted their chance to compete for the multimillion-dollar final briefcase, and they were ready to let their biceps burn to get it.

Lete lost her grip first, after the 30-minute mark. Luckily for her, she happened to give out on a pretty good case — $2.5 million, the third-highest possible. Manganiello prompted her to add her weight to someone else’s load, so naturally, she chose her in-game nemesis, David. Then came the funniest flub this season of DONDI has seen so far.

Both C.K. and Parv were getting tired, so when the $3 million case came up, they both wanted it. But after agreeing that they needed to communicate to avoid accidentally splitting it, they both announced they were claiming it and dropped their money at the same time. This could have been a brilliant act of sabotage on C.K.’s part to end Parvati’s weeks-long safety streak, but alas, she admitted (furiously) that it really was a simple mistake. Parvati, meanwhile, looked ready to eat her alive. When C.K. tried to smooth things over, she cut her off with a “Girl, it’s too late — it’s done.” No kidding.

That left us with David and Phillip, who, lest we forget, had just last-minute pinkie promised to take each other to the end. Did any of us believe either of them would keep it? Anyone? Bueller?

Like any good gamer, David knew it was time to try some inception — and Phillip had already said he was considering the money. It didn’t take much convincing. Both of them were getting shaky, with Phillip holding his own weight and Parvati’s while David struggled with his, Lete’s, and C.K.’s.

Still, David drove it home by saying he’d “give” Phillip the money if he dropped after him — a pretty obvious manipulation, given that Phillip would get the $75,000 regardless if David dropped first. By letting David take the $2.75 million case — the highest left — Phillip would be the one giving him something. But again, this game is all about convincing people you’re doing them a favor when really, you’re stealing from the palm of their hand — and David’s very good at it.

Also, here’s the thing: Phillip probably thought he could hold on longer than he did. After David dropped, if Phillip had held on for three more cases, he could have claimed $1.75, which would have left Parvati and C.K. in the bottom two with $1.5 million apiece. Instead, he gave out soon after David and wound up with $1.25 million — the lowest case value in the game.

And so, instead of a bottom two, we got a bottom three — Phillip, plus C.K. and Parvati, who tied for second lowest. David had to pick who would go home and who would face the banker.

This is where things got really messy. C.K. tried to explain herself to David and Parv, who didn’t want to hear any of it. She promised to take out Lete if she faced the banker, but this game’s power “couple” wasn’t born yesterday, so of course they didn’t totally believe her.

Naturally, though, the most interesting negotiation here was between David and Parv. David knew this would be the week to take Parv out, and he had a clear shot to do it. But would he have the stomach for a move like that? A quick little montage of Parv putting her head on David’s shoulder and burying her face in his bare chest reminded us of the bond these two have built on this deal-making island. Could he really betray her now?

Then again, what does “betrayal” mean here? Parv wanted Phillip out because she was convinced if he beats the banker, he’d take her out — and she was right. Still, did she want to face the banker when C.K. is promising to cut Lete if she wins?

Because C.K. cannot pass up an opportunity to make things weird, she went back on her promise and told Parvati in the showers that she would probably “have” to eliminate her if she won against the banker. With that, Parvati pulled a middle-school-bully move on her, asked if she really wanted to face Lete in the finale, and told her to “get a life.” Guess that fake alliance is over now!

In the end, David did the predictable thing and took out Phillip. It’s a bummer, but at the same time, Phillip had to know this was a possibility — even if David promised him safety. If that truly didn’t occur to him, frankly, he deserved to lose. As for who will play the banker? We’ll all just have to sit here burning on the edge of our seats until next week, because these cruel editors left us on a big ol’ cliffhanger.

David might need to watch his back, lest Parvati “Black Widow” him, but he’s a beast at challenges and also has a (slightly) better relationship C.K., which could be enough to send him off to the banker. Parvati and David could take each other to the end, assuming he doesn’t cut her out. C.K. is after her, though, so the real question is where she stands with Lete. C.K. is an absolute mess, but somehow, that seems to throw everyone off their rhythm and work in her favor. Maybe she can chaos-baby her way to the end! Lete has made it clear she’s working against David and Parv, and with all of her reliable allies gone, she’ll need to put in some serious work to evade elimination. That said, I’d love to see her succeed!

https://vulture.com,Denise Richards & Her Wild Things Recap: Only Godzilla Forgives,https://www.vulture.com/article/denise-richards-and-her-wild-things-recap-episodes-3-4.html,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 02:00:02 GMT","As I said when I recapped the first two episodes of Denise Richards & Her Wild Things, I root for Denise. That means, by default, I root for this show. I was even fairly kind in my assessment of the first hour, which didn’t come anywhere near the heights of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, the series it’s been paired with. But there are some things I can’t defend — lines that I won’t cross — and a memorial for a lizard is near the top of that list. Not since Tom Schwartz forced us to endure a poolside memorial for his lizard, Daug, during the worst-ever season of Vanderpump Rules, have I felt such despair over what I was watching. Denise has given us another lizard memorial, this time for Brooke Mueller’s longtime companion Godzilla.

The best thing I can say about the Godzilla storyline of “Drop Dead Gorgeous Lizard,” the first of two new episodes aired back-to-back, is that it at least resembles plot, which is more than can be said for anything else that happens. Following the resolution of the Sami-Lola conflict at the end of the second episode, the show seems to be scrambling for direction. We get a scene of Denise taking her eldest daughters rock climbing, which is about as dynamic as it sounds. (I did enjoy Denise bragging to the instructor about her time filming Special Forces and her disappointment when he hadn’t heard of it.) Denise tells Sami and Lola they’ll have to plan the memorial for Godzilla, because Brooke has requested it — she calls Godzilla her “little soulmate” in a flashback — and because (though this part’s unspoken) they need something to do if they’re not going to fight with each other. I appreciate Lola not wanting to tell her employer she has to miss work for a non-human memorial, even as I agree with Denise’s advice to just flub the details.

As I’m coming to learn with Denise Richards & Her Wild Things, it’s the darkness lurking under the surface that’s most compelling. I’m already over all the reminders of how totally wacky these people are. “This is not normal,” says Denise of all the pets they’ve had, “but there’s nothing normal about us or about our family.” The constant insistence on weirdness is starting to feel like the “she’s so crazzzzzzzy! Love her!” meme. Give me more of Sami and Lola not knowing if Brooke ever married their father (she did) or Denise mentioning that Godzilla was dropped off on her doorstep without warning when Brooke was being taken to rehab. I certainly don’t need this show to be an onslaught of trauma — I do believe this family has been through enough — but it has to be willing to dive into the ugly stuff sometimes if it wants to keep us invested.

It’s the show’s desire to steer clear of mess that makes Denise’s long-awaited sit-down with Erika Jayne such a disappointment. Erika is currently having a stellar season on RHOBH, and I was looking forward to the spark she could bring to this show. Unfortunately, she spends more time listening to Denise explain Godzilla’s memorial than anything else. They do also make up following their explosive fight on season 13 of RHOBH, but neither of them brings up the real root of their estrangement. “Erika and I were starting to become friends, and then from there, it went super sideways for some reason,” Denise says in a confessional. That reason, as far as I can tell, is Brandi Glanville accusing Denise of having a clandestine affair with her, culminating in a Denise takedown by Lisa Rinna. Erika may not have been the ringleader, but she was on Rinna’s side, and that’s clearly central to Denise’s feelings here — it’s why she left RHOBH! Of course, there is no way in hell Denise would ever let Brandi’s name come up on her own show, so instead we rehash the drama about Erika’s potty mouth around a much younger Sami and Lola. Erika says she felt judged, and they apologize to each other. I didn’t expect thrown glasses of Casamigos, but was it too much to hope for something a tiny bit more substantive?

At the same time, I’ll take an uneventful Denise and Erika scene over Sami and Lola going to the frame store to get a giant photo of Godzilla framed for the memorial. You can’t just take cameras along on your errands and call it a show! We do get some hints of ongoing strife between Sami and Lola, but it all seems like normal sister stuff: Sami not letting Lola use her fancy hairbrush, Sami flipping Lola off, Sami asking Lola if there are any good prayers for lizards. Okay, so it’s really mostly Sami antagonizing Lola, though she also gets very protective on Lola’s behalf when a guy who does not make Jesus the center of his life won’t stop blowing up Lola’s phone. Sami feels like she always has Lola’s back, and that Lola doesn’t do the same for her. Again, this strikes me as a completely standard sibling complaint, but I’ve been told this family is wild and crazy, so maybe I’m wrong here.

Here’s what I’ll say about the lizard memorial itself: It’s actually lovely. There is a framed photo of Godzilla along with a framed photo of Stevie Nicks (he loved Fleetwood Mac). There’s a cake made out of Fig Newtons, his favorite food. Everyone gets up to talk about their memories of Godzilla. “I really miss this little guy,” Aaron offers. “I saw him and I’m like, that guy’s really special.” While Denise is mildly bothered that her daughters didn’t get a rabbi, probably because they didn’t remember Brooke was Jewish (or their father’s third ex-wife), Lola is forced into delivering a prayer. She speaks from the heart about Brooke’s grief: “The fact that she was able to find love from Godzilla, I pray that she continues to find love flowing into her life from the Lord.” Before I spend too much time pondering whether or not Denise Richards & Her Wild Things counts as faith-based programming, we’re wrapping things up. Denise is glad she got her daughters to work together, and now thinks they can plan her funeral when she dies. Sami finds this morbid, but as Denise loves to remind us, “life is short.”

Personally speaking, “Life is short” is not something I want to hear when I’m watching a subpar reality series, though the second new episode of the show is a slight improvement. I’m probably being overly generous (or just feeling grateful about not having to sit through another lizard memorial) because there’s really not much more going on in “OnlyPans.” In fact, a huge chunk of the episode is taken up by Denise filming herself making homemade pasta with Sami and Eloise. It’s fairly disastrous, but this is all part of Denise’s audition for her own cooking show. “I just think it would be fun and something different,” she says, “being someone that is not trained at all.” While I support her in all her endeavors, I do wonder why she’s not focusing on doing a better job with the show she’s currently filming. When the pasta-making is done — without any pasta to show for it — Denise says, “This video isn’t even worth posting.” Can’t argue with that, so why did we spend several minutes watching it on TV?

But I do think this is a better episode for Denise overall. There is a great scene where we meet Eloise’s homeschool teacher, Miss Angie, and learn a little bit more about her communication skills and limitations. Eloise can say eight to ten words, though she usually whispers them, and she’s learning how to respond “yes” or “no” via text. Denise’s third daughter also finally gets to join her mom for a confessional, and you can really see what a supportive and loving mother Denise is. I appreciate how the entire segment never feels condescending — it’s respectful and compassionate, and the producers are meeting Eloise where she’s at in getting her involved in the show. Seeing this side of Denise helps me forgive a lot, including the revelation that her OnlyFans photos were briefly synced to Eloise’s iPad. Hey, nobody’s perfect.

Meanwhile, Denise is clearly struggling with what kind of example she’s set for Sami, who is enthusiastically going under the knife for a new nose after getting breast implants. She says these are surgeries she’s wanted for as long as she can remember, which is a dark thing to hear coming from a 20-year-old. Also dark: Sami revealing she’s paying to get a nose that looks more like her mother’s. In a confessional, a tearful Denise says, “I feel bad that she feels she has to live up to my nose or whatever the fuck, ’cause I don’t want them to feel they have to look a certain way.” That’s a lovely sentiment, although it’s one I wish she would express more directly to Sami — and perhaps she has! It’s clear from Sami’s insistence that Denise not come with her to the surgery, and that Lola be kept in the dark, that she sometimes keeps her family at arm’s length. On a practical level, Sami doesn’t want too many people to know about her nose job, because she told a lot of people about her implants, and they encouraged her to opt for a smaller size, which she now regrets.

Denise is, however, allowed to come with Sami to the pre-op appointment, during which Dr. Dugar explains that he’s going to do a “finesse rhinoplasty.” This sounds very chill to me until he uses the phrase, “We just filet your natural anatomy.” Denise and Sami are both visibly horrified by this, and I would like to never think about it again. I’m honestly sorry to even put it in writing. Mercifully, we don’t see Sami’s surgery at the end of the episode, but we do see her wish she had told Lola, who could have said an “85-minute long prayer” for her. (I am interested in Sami’s true feelings about Lola’s born-again Christian identity, despite the fact that the show is already becoming bogged down in Jesus talk. Lola even says, “I can do all things through Christ” while assembling a dog crate.) Regardless, Lola does find out about the nose job because Denise accidentally spills the beans at the end of the episode. Like Lola, I fail to see why this is a big deal. Wasn’t she going to find out imminently anyway? Or was Sami planning to hide until she was fully healed and then hope she could credit any facial changes to contouring?

The only other notable event in the episode (and I use the word notable loosely) is Denise’s “OnlyPans” photoshoot, where she forces Aaron to take photos of her covering her boobs with pans. “People would be like, ‘Okay, Denise Richards’s cooking show … boring,’” she says when explaining her rationale for the saucy pics. Denise being topless except for pans, on the other hand, is an attention-grabber. Listen, I love the shamelessness and the naked (no pun intended) ambition. I like when Denise admits that after making Wild Things, she was told to go in a different direction to avoid being pigeonholed as a sex symbol, and now she balances her OnlyFans with Christian and conservative movies. (I’m dying to see Angels Fallen: Warriors of Peace.) But we are four episodes into this reality show, and I feel the need to reiterate that I’d really like to see Denise focus on the task at hand. While I’m not giving up hope on Denise Richards & Her Wild Things, I can’t pretend my attention isn’t fading.

It’s a rare moment when we get to see a podcast’s segment turned against itself. Rarely does Call Her Daddy morph into a meta critique of Call Her Daddy, and The Town doesn’t ever seem to use its “The Call Sheet” to talk about its own ratings. But on Las Culturistas this week, Lady Gaga, who is there to promote Mayhem, does just that. Upon reaching hosts Bowen Yang and Matt Rogers’s esteemed “I Don’t Think So, Honey” segment, which requires Bowen, Rogers, and the guest to rant against something in culture for 60 seconds, Gaga seems worried. After Rogers performs his off-the-cuff rant, Gaga says, “I am dead over that rant,” and after Yang goes off, she is left basically in shock, incapable of speaking. All that leads up to her IDTSH, which ends up being “I don’t think so, honey, that you guys are putting me on the spot to do this.”

“I hate ranting; I hate confronting people,” Gaga explains, which is funny because she is choosing the most confrontational option possible: the people who are in the room with her at that very moment. “It is so scary to me,” she says. “I feel scared. I want to cry. I love you both so much, but I don’t think so that you’re putting me on this spot. I’m just gonna do whatever you say, whenever you ask me to do it! When you tell me to do things, it makes me want to cry — it makes me insane!” When she finally reaches the end of her allotted 60 seconds, she says, “Thank you so much for having me here, but please, please, please don’t make me get angry about anything in public.” It is truly the manic work of a woman who is being gay tortured. If she ever gets forced to go again, we have some suggestions:

• I don’t think so, honey, people not putting enough respect on the song “Bad Kids” from Born This Way.

• I don’t think so, honey, Warner Bros. not releasing Coyote vs. Acme but still releasing a different Looney Tunes movie in 2025.

• I don’t think so, honey, how confusing the rules on the show Deal or No Deal Island are.",vulture

For more on Severance, sign up for Severance Club, our subscriber-exclusive newsletter obsessing over, dissecting, and debating everything about season two.

Spoilers ahead for Severance season two, through episode eight, “Sweet Vitriol.”

At the end of “Chikhai Bardo,” Devon Scout takes the reins of Mark’s increasingly messy reintegration process, basically firing Dr. Reghabi and summoning the big guns by calling Mrs. Selvig — sorry, Ms. Cobel! — for help. Viewers who thought, Oh yeah, where is Ms. Cobel, anyway?” could easily be excused for not having Patricia Arquette’s character at the forefront of their mind; we had scarcely seen her since she drove off toward someplace called Salt’s Neck five episodes ago. But she reemerges in full force in “Sweet Vitriol,” which takes place the same day Devon frantically reaches out to Cobel, and it does for Lumon’s disgraced severed-floor manager what “Chikhai Bardo” did for Gemma Scout, answering some questions while raising others.

Unlike the Ms. Cobel of Severance’s first season, the Harmony Cobel who takes center stage in “Sweet Vitriol” has reached the galvanizing state of grim determination and seething fury she needs to stomach a return to her rusted-out husk of a small coastal hometown after decades away. The resulting backstory-laden stand-alone episode is essentially a three-hander for Arquette, James LeGros (playing Hampton, whom Harmony refers to as her former colleague but is strongly coded as a childhood sweetheart), and Jane Alexander (as Harmony’s Aunt Sissy). For all the revelations in “Sweet Vitriol,” though, it is just as brimming with what’s not there — alluding to histories between characters and moments from Cobel’s past that the episode only glances at — so we asked Arquette to help fill in the blanks.

A bunch of revelations and questions are packed into “Sweet Vitriol,” but we have to start with a timeline question: When did you learn Harmony Cobel was the true inventor of severance?

There was some allusion to it in earlier episodes, her connection to severance being very personal and pivotal, but I didn’t really understand the full extent until I got that script.

As Harmony flips through the notebook, sort of shaking it at her aunt to show her all the work she’s done, we see it’s not just conceptual; she created the Overtime Contingency, the Glasgow Block, all of it. How has that knowledge of Harmony’s contributions to the company informed your understanding of her relationship with severance?

I had layered into my performance already that she felt a certain ownership and was involved on a very deep level with severance. Her perception of the procedure and what it meant for her and the company, then seeing how really pivotal she was to all of it, gave me a different level of leverage for her in her relationship with Lumon. It’s like, Oh, you guys are going to try to screw me over. I have this proof now, so how am I going to utilize this to make you give me what I want or to make this turn out in a better way for myself than it’s going right now?

This reframes so much of Harmony’s behavior in the previous season. Her life is littered with instances and different types of severance: She’s severed from her family and friends once she goes to school, she’s severed from her mother and what remains of her family, and then she’s severed from her own creation.

Yeah, and then her Aunt Sissy reminds her that no matter how brilliant her work is, she should be ashamed of taking any credit! All the glory goes to the company, the religion, the organization. That assumption isn’t far off from our reality, either, that attitude of “You sign a contract, whatever you think of or build or do on our clock is ours. We own it.”

This revelation of Harmony as a genius-level woman in STEM also changed my perception of her conversations with both Helly R. and Helena Eagan. Helena’s entire life flows from the ingenuity and skills of this person she’s treating like garbage!

I think Harmony has a bunch of understandings all at once. First, there’s Oh my God, you spoiled person, why are you treating me like this? At the same time, she wants Helena to see that genius. And then there’s the annoyance and horror of Why am I being forced to deal with this unruly Eagan, who could die on my watch? Helena’s presence and playacting at being Helly R., and the real Helly R., too — they all challenge Harmony’s subconscious need for severance and the value it has in her mind.

Could you break down the breathing-tube scene? We’ve known for a long time that the tube has real significance to Harmony, but now it’s performing a number of functions.

First off, Harmony’s mom became an ether addict. Whenever you deal with a drug addict as a child, you don’t get the parenting you need. And then she is trying to please this corporation and her school and her aunt, even though she hates her aunt. On top of that, her aunt put a wedge between Harmony and her mom, and her aunt is very judgmental of her mom, whom Harmony wants to protect even now. So the breathing tube is holding the love she didn’t get. Breathing through it is almost like getting a kiss from her mom, lying in bed and cuddling with her. It’s also tied to her not getting to have any kind of closure, not getting to say good-bye to her mother, and all this trauma is resurfacing because she has been unceremoniously kicked out of Lumon.

I imagine the landscape and the town of Salt’s Neck don’t help either. It’s so bleak and cold, and it reveals the damage left behind by the earlier iteration of Lumon.

Yes! Early Lumon is clearly part of a broken-down industrial age. The ether factory was an attempt at something big, but you can see it didn’t work and it created this whole environmental nightmare, too. They killed this whole town, and now there’s the new, rebranded Lumon with its bright carpeting, new aesthetic, and cute cartoons. There’s also a kind of lingering Bergmanesque coldness and loneliness to the whole area, not just in Harmony’s mother’s old room. That room is so quiet and dusty and strange and cold, and all of that’s reflected in real things like the icebergs floating by.

The only warmth in the episode comes from Hampton, James Le Gros’s character. He’s literally pouring hot cups of coffee for people at his tiny shack restaurant, and he helps Harmony out when she needs him, even though driving her out to Aunt Sissy’s place is the last thing he wants to do that day.

I always love to work with James. We get to see Harmony as the girl she used to be, glimpses of the feelings and the relationship between them before something bad went down. He’s mad at her, but you also see he’s the only person who really cares about or does anything to help her. I really think they were each other’s first love and a lot of things got in the way of that — his not being a company man, his drug addiction, his lack of ambition. James and I have known each other a little since we were teenagers. He was good friends with a boyfriend of mine and helped me move all my boxes out of my mom’s house, and I made him cookies as a thank-you. So we go way back.

Once Hampton takes Harmony up to Aunt Sissy’s house, we’re plunked right into the thick of some awful stuff. Can you talk a bit more about the family history between Harmony and Sissy?

I mean, Jane Alexander is just a powerhouse. And there’s so much history between these two characters, so much pain and judgment, and so much wanting. Harmony wants her aunt to acknowledge her, to make her pain go away. Like, “Why didn’t you let me know? Why didn’t you do this for my mother?” There’s just a lot of unshielded rawness in Harmony’s younger self, and that wanting shows us how dangerous her family is. Playing those scenes with Jane in this old, uninsulated saltbox house with the wind blowing through it was so interesting. We’re literally rattling around in a house from the turn of the past century; it felt like we were in a time warp.

You also feel that sense of history a bit with the ether, which underpins so much of Harmony’s experiences, especially her mother’s and Hampton’s addictions, and the desolation of the town where she grew up. But that moment where she huffs it in her mother’s bedroom also leads to her brainwave about the notebook’s location. Having played that scene, what do you think Harmony thinks about the role of ether in her life?

I don’t know that Harmony consciously thinks about it that way, but I do. I grew up in a time when there were so many heroin addicts, and I remember a therapist once said to me that when you’re high, heroin is like a mother holding you. There’s an aspect of that to ether. That’s very interesting for me, how it connects with the breathing tube. But there’s also an aspect of forgetting with ether that makes it a very primitive form of severance. If I were going to choose a drug that would work like severance, it would be ether.",vulture

If you’ve been following Scarlett Johansson’s career for a while, then you’re probably aware that there’s not a lot of places you can follow her online. ScarJo is that rare breed of A-list celebrity who does not use social media — and in a recent interview with InStyle, she affirmed that she plans to keep it that way, even as requests keep rolling in. “I mean, even today, I got an email from Universal [Pictures], and they’re like, ‘Hey, would you consider joining Instagram in tandem with the release of Jurassic World Rebirth?’ [I] get a lot of pressure to join social media.” Johansson previously acknowledged in an April 2023 episode of The Skinny Confidential Him & Her Podcast that she previously got on Instagram “once for three days,” but deleted it after feeling like she’d “wasted” time looking at someone’s page and getting the urge to “change [her] life” to be more like theirs. “I honestly am too fragile of a person to have social media,” she said. “My ego is too fragile. I can’t deal with it. My brain is too fragile, I’m like a delicate flower. I have enough anxiety.”

While Johansson understands the business potential of the app, she told InStyle that making an account goes against her “core values.” Elsewhere in the interview, the actress similarly emphasized with a laugh that she doesn’t feel like there’s a way she could create an account and “stay true” to who she is. “The work that I put out there is all based in truth. That’s the key ingredient. So if I was a person who really enjoyed social media, then I could totally get on the bandwagon,” Johansson said. “But I’m not. And I think the film will do fine.” It is kind of funny to emphasize that her work is based truth given that her latest movie involves genetically engineered dinosaurs, but we know what she means.",vulture
https://vulture.com,The Valley Season Two Drama Reaches New Peaks,https://www.vulture.com/article/the-valley-season-2-trailer-jax-taylor-brittany-cartwright.html,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 01:16:24 GMT","Guess bad things really do come in threes for Jax Taylor. “I already told him. Filing, restraining order, and custody,” Brittany Cartwright says in the trailer for the second season of The Valley. She’s already checked the first thing off her list; Taylor is served with divorce papers in the three-minute preview. Cartwright claims that the father of her 3-year-old son, Cruz, has been bringing girls to their home, with one allegedly leaving a thong and a baby wipe behind. She also alleges that he’s had people “watching” her. For his part, Taylor — who checked himself into rehab last year to address his mental health struggles and recently publicly acknowledged his history with cocaine addiction — says he’s “not satisfied” with who he is anymore, and admits to former Vanderpump Rules co-star Tom Schwartz that he “was a fucking terrible husband.”

But Cartwright and Taylor aren’t the only ones going through it this season: Jesse Lally alleges that Michelle Saniei cheated on him and is “sleeping with a billionaire for $1,500 a night” (which seems a bit stingy for someone with that kind of net worth), Danny Booko is accused of groping people, and Kristen Doute pointedly claims that Jason Caperna takes his wedding ring off when going out. Apart from Luke Broderick’s punny proposal to Doute on a boat, there’s hardly a happy moment in sight.

https://indiewire.com,"After a Self-Imposed Acting Hiatus, Michael Fassbender Explains Why Projects Like ‘Black Bag’ and ‘The Agency’ Brought Him Back",https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/michael-fassbender-black-bag-the-agency-interview-1235103003/,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 21:30:00 GMT","Michael Fassbender is back. After a recent four-year hiatus (2020-2023) to pursue Formula One racing at Le Mans, he’s returned to acting with a vengeance.

In 2023, he played a perfectionist assassin in David Fincher’s “The Killer” (Netflix); an alcoholic soccer coach in Taika Waititi’s sports comedy “Next Goal Wins” (Searchlight); and took on his first TV series since his early years, as a London CIA agent in love with Jodie Turner-Smith’s Sudanese professor in “The Agency” (Paramount+/Showtime).

And, this week, his latest movie opens in theaters, Steven Soderbergh’s “Black Bag” (Focus), a rarity in today’s world: an original smart spy thriller for adults.

Fassbender is specializing in spies of late. In this witty British whodunit artfully written by Hollywood veteran David Koepp (“Jurassic Park,” “Spider-Man,” “Mission: Impossible”), the German-Irish Fassbender is George Woodhouse, a star spy at Britain’s National Cyber Security Centre, happily married to another star spy, Kathryn St. Jean (Cate Blanchett).

At the start of the film, George is given a list of five possible moles at his agency — his wife is on it. He tells her he’s tracking a traitor, but not that she’s a suspect. She’s in his “black bag,” the place where secrets are hidden.

When Fassbender first read the script, “it was a fantastic collection of characters,” he said on Zoom. “And it falls into the film demographic that we just don’t see a lot of these days. That it was going to get made was exciting. It’s hard for film companies to support films in that budget category, there’s not many $30 to $40 million films anymore, unfortunately.”

He continued, “As I started reading the script: ‘Wow, this is smart and funny.’ And it moved at a click. The pace at which I was propelled forward by these characters was exciting. And we were in this spy genre: the story wasn’t motivated by action set pieces, it was psychological warfare going on between these fascinating and intriguing characters. There are a couple of visceral moments in the film that are quite violent, for sure, but what’s propelling it forward are these crackling scenes of dialogue and intellect between these characters.”

At the start of the movie, George invites his agency suspects to dinner, and all hell breaks loose. Fassbender loved playing the two centerpiece dinner scenes, one introductory, the other climactic, which were the only ones rehearsed with the six actors (Fassbender, Blanchett, Tom Burke, Marisa Abela, Naomie Harris, and Regé-Jean Page).

“Steven Soderbergh sets up a relaxed atmosphere on set,” said Fassbender. “It’s fun to watch him come into a room, look around, light it, be the DP [director of photography], operate the camera, be the director, and then go home and edit whatever we shot that day. We move fast. He’ll operate 95 percent of the time. You’re always trying to develop a rapport with the person behind the camera, because you’re going to be doing a dance with them throughout. He has a lot of confidence in the way he casts it. It’s a choice of his not to interfere with whatever the players are bringing.”

At the first dinner party, George is taciturn behind his thick black glasses. “George doesn’t show a lot of emotion of any kind, really,” Fassbender said. “That was evident in the script, right from the first scene when he meets [fellow spy] Meacham with the list of five names. David Koepp had written that it is hard to read anything on George’s face, it’s a standard for him. But it was a lot of fun playing it. We [the actors] never talked between each other about relationships at all. There was a lot of trust in whatever the other person brought to the scene, and then you would respond accordingly.”

The dinner scenes were less a challenge for the six actors sitting around a table, than the director. “For us, it was an opportunity to all be together in one scene,” said Fassbender. “You don’t have to figure out any blocking. It was finding the rhythm between each other.” The rehearsal was for Soderbergh’s benefit. “He said those two scenes were keeping him up at night. It was where he was going to put the camera, the different angles he was going to find, keeping those scenes dynamic,” the actor said. “If handled the wrong way, it could just become flat and lose that tension that is so necessary.”

The real tension in the film is between this happily married couple. Will George do what he says and stay loyal to his wife, no matter what? “Yeah,” said Fassbender. “It’s not to say that he wouldn’t investigate fully to see her culpability in this scenario. If she is one of the traitors on this list, he’s still going to find that out. Then he’ll figure out what to do from there. He’s a process-driven individual. He’s analytical. He will gather all the pieces of evidence together before making any assumption and then take the next step. But for me, his loyalty always laid with his wife. It’s a lonely world. It’s an isolating world. What’s unique about the characters Kathryn and George: they have each other. None of the other characters have that.”

Marisa Abela (“Back to Black”) as younger agent Clarissa is struggling to find a balanced life as she dates a fellow agent (Burke). “How are you supposed to date anybody outside the agency?,” said Fassbender. “It’s impossible. She is the audience. She is the new person coming into this world. And I’ve always wondered what kind of person wants to become a spy or enter into this world of espionage. A lot of people are driven by idealism, and a real willingness to help their country, and patriotism. You can see through her that naivety and enthusiasm and idealism, and you can see the other characters that have been doing it for a while, the various levels of cynicism that come with that.”

Fassbender has had some recent practice using his spy muscles. In “The Agency,” a remake of hit French series “Le Bureau” written by Jez and John-Henry Butterworth (“Edge of Tomorrow,” “Ford v. Ferrari”), he plays Martian, an undercover CIA spy come in from the cold to London. We watch him adopt and shed different personae with his bosses (Jeffrey Wright and Richard Gere), the in-house shrink (Harriet Sansom Harris), and his lover Samia (Turner-Smith). With her, his face opens and shows emotions, and when he leaves her, closes again.

“It’s that idea of spies being forgettable,” said Fassbender. “They would enter a room and leave it and you would never remember that person. So it’s trying to find a balance of not having that on screen, so an audience forgets you, but staying true to it, and then finding the moments where you can see the real human being come through. Martian lies and tells the truth. He’s lost the compass where the lies start and end. With his daughter Poppy, he tells these inconsequential lies. Why did he do that? It becomes second nature, that idea of your resting place being that steeped in paranoia that you could never leave that paranoid itch alone, because you might die, it might be the end of you.”

He added, “I knew that I could show some signs of the human being with Samia and Poppy. You get a peek into what he might have been like, or what he is like. But you never really know, because it could also be a performance for them as well, consciously or subconsciously, because he’s just been lying so for so long.”

Carrying a ten-episode TV series was an adjustment. “This was a definitely different experience,” said Fassbender, “just the volume of of dialogue, the speed that you work at. You don’t have the luxury of time that you would on a film set. You’ve got to make decisions fast, and move fast.”

The actor returns to the fray at the end of April when “The Agency” Season 2 starts shooting in London, Estonia, and Egypt. Fassbender is reading all the scripts now. “‘The Agency’ is a slow burn,” he said. “You have to lean in as an audience member and do a little bit of work, but then the payoff comes through as it starts to ramp up and the walls start closing in. And Season Two, it just continues to tighten. It doesn’t let up.”

As if Fassbender didn’t have enough to do, he also joined the cast of scrappy Irish film “Kneecap” in 2023, playing an IRA officer and the father of one of the rappers at its heart. At the outset, it was far from clear that the movie would be a small arthouse hit for Sony Pictures Classics and wind up on the International Feature Film Oscar shortlist.

“I loved what they were doing,” said Fassbender. “As soon as I saw their music videos and what they were all about, I thought, ‘These guys are the real deal, and everything about them is genuine. There’s nothing contrived about them. They’re smart, they’re funny, and they’ve got an infectious energy. They’re born performers. They’re doing exactly what they’re supposed to do in life.'”

After putting the four “X-Men” and two “Alien” movies in the rear view, at age 47 Fassbender is in superb physical shape, but is less invested in action spectacle, “probably because I was younger and I could run around and bounce off the walls better than I can do today,” he said. “I’ve never had any fixed plan. I did make a conscious decision of taking a break. I was doing three, four films a year, sometimes. That wasn’t by design. Sometimes you sign up to something and there’s a delay. The next thing you know, three films are back to back. But I wanted to get into racing, and approach it seriously and give my time to it. And obviously it’s impossible for me to do a race season and film, just for insurance reasons alone. It was good for me to take a break and get some perspective and try something totally different.”

When Fassbender returned to acting with David Fincher on “The Killer,” he credits his Formula One racing with helping him adapt to the director’s meticulous perfectionism and multiple takes. “It’s fractional, the work you’re doing with him,” said Fassbender. “It’s as precise as when you’re racing and you’re coming back and you’re looking at the data and you’re analyzing corner to corner: ‘Did I lose a tenth of a second here or three tenths?’ So it was quite helpful.”

(While Fassbender did most of the assassin’s heart-rate-lowering yoga, “we did have somebody do that leg kick in the back,” he said.)

He sees similarities with Fincher and Soderbergh, who are good friends. “They’re directors who’ve worked in all the different departments on a film set,” said Fassbender. “They have a language for each department. They have a deep understanding of cinematic history, but different ways of executing what they want. [Fincher’s] belief is, the distillation of doing a scene a number of times is not just for performance, but for camera moves, for whatever is happening in the frame.”

Clearly, Fassbender, who has been married to fellow actor Alicia Vikander since 2017, is in a happy place. “I’m glad to be acting again,” he said, “because I realize it’s the only thing I can do.”

But by his own admission, the scribe behind 25 Academy Award ceremonies and more than his fair share of Miss Universe and USA pageants has also penned some real flops.

In his new book, “It Seemed Like a Bad Idea at the Time: The Worst TV Shows in History and Other Things I Wrote,” Vilanch walks readers through some of the most ill-conceived projects he’s been attached to over the years — from 1978’s “The Star Wars Holiday Special” to the now infamous 1989 Oscars ceremony that opened with Rob Lowe and Snow White pirouetting to “Proud Mary.”

“‘It was a terrible idea, and I shouldn’t have gotten involved’ didn’t even occur to us at the time,” Vilanch told IndieWire on a Zoom call, using the screen name “travis kelce’s other” in a nod to online comparisons between him and the NFL mom, which he’s helped fuel.

“Most of these things happened before the internet, and the internet is what tells you that you shouldn’t have done it, because they constantly pummel you with, ‘Well, what do you want to hear from that guy for? Look what he wrote,’” he said. “And they all came back to haunt me.”

Vilanch, who came up in the era of comedy legends like Carol Burnett and Dean Martin, often alludes in conversation and in the book to the thrashings he’s taken from “keyboard warriors.” But the frequent guest on pop culture podcasts actually seems to enjoy younger viewers discovering and deriding his less-successful variety shows, TV specials, and stage productions. And he uses “It Seemed Like a Bad Idea at the Time” to join in the fun, musing about the power-drunk producers, degenerate writers, and illicit substances that helped birth bizarre projects starring the likes of Florence Henderson, Paul Lynde, Bea Arthur, Charo and — before she shot the whole thing down — Carol Channing.

In the case of “The Brady Bunch Hour” — which alternated weeks on CBS with “The Hardy Boys” and “Nancy Drew” from 1976 to 1977 — the problems began when storied network producer Fred Silverman had a lightbulb moment involving America’s favorite blended TV family.

For five seasons beginning in 1969, “The Brady Bunch” enjoyed a successful run on ABC, convincing Silverman that the ensemble of actors, led by Henderson and Robert Reed, would make perfect variety show hosts. His solution was to embed a variety show within a sitcom about the Bradys and Alice (Ann B. Davis) moving to Los Angeles to pursue a career in TV. But as everyone found out once they arrived on set, working in musical performances and drop-ins from guest stars like Tina Turner and Vincent Price into the Bradys’ once-rather-mundane existence was, in fact, a very bad idea.

“’The Brady Bunch’ existed as the Brady Bunch. They didn’t have ‘an act,’ so to have them suddenly get a variety show was kind of weird,” Vilanch said, citing Silverman’s penchant for offbeat and sometimes disastrous variety shows at the time, including “Pink Lady and Jeff.” “There was a better way to do it, but this was what we were handed. And I didn’t even know that until we actually got to the thing.”

According to Vilanch’s book, neither the motley crew of writers assembled to bring the producer’s vision to life nor the stars of the show had any idea what “The Brady Bunch Hour” would entail until at least a month after arriving on location. At that point, the writers gathered to familiarize themselves (for the first time) with the original show and began concocting various excuses for having big-name stars floating in and out of the Bradys’ new life in Malibu. And eventually, someone broke the news to the unsuspecting cast — some of whom took it worse than others.

“They all thought they were going into some sort of revival of the old show with some musical elements added. They didn’t think they were expected to become Osmonds overnight, that there would be songs to learn, dance routines to master, characters to play in sketches. And the characters wouldn’t simply be characters. They would be their Brady character playing a character,” Vilanch writes, adding that this was “a drastic change from entering from the backyard and asking Alice what was for dinner.”

“Robert Reed, the captain of the SS Brady, was especially hard hit by this revelation, as he was a seriously serious actor,” he continues. “If you ever watch the show, you will see a man going through a deep psychological struggle trying to make sense of Mike Brady, architect and family man, attempting a soft-shoe with a straw hat and cane.”

Chewbacca, a Wookiee Christmas, and a Creature Nicknamed “C*ntface”

In “It Seemed Like a Bad Idea at the Time,” Vilanch never passes up a chance to share (mostly) harmless gossip about a famous former coworker, tell an outrageous story, or revel in on-set shenanigans.

Along with describing the show’s disastrous start, Vilanch peppers “The Brady Bunch Hour” chapter with anecdotes about a closeted Reed coming to life in Carmen Miranda drag, Henderson flashing the writers’ room after getting pranked, and new cast member Rip Taylor waging a pointless battle to win over Davis, who’d recently found Jesus. While in the previous chapter on 1976’s “The Paul Lynde Halloween Special,” he recounts how ABC’s push to appeal to younger audiences resulted in the biting “Bewitched” comedian driving a semi-truck through a stage wall in sequins and KISS regaling the audience with rock ballads, alongside Margaret Hamilton playing the Wicked Witch of the West.

But some of his juiciest revelations come from the book’s opening pages, which describe how a key misunderstanding about the nature of variety TV led to the Wookiee-centered collaboration between George Lucas, a group of enthusiastic CBS producers, and a room full of writers on a variety of substances.

“I don’t think George knew what he was getting into when he sold them that,” Vilanch said of Lucas pitching the network “The Star Wars Holiday Special” before turning back to more legitimate endeavors, like filming “The Empire Strikes Back.”

“He withdrew once he saw what was happening, but it was too late,” the comedian added, underscoring the point he makes in the book that neither the “Star Wars” creator nor his team knew exactly what a variety special entailed. “It was on, so all he could do was begin disowning it before it was born.”

Although Lucas may have saved some face with his early exit, it certainly didn’t help the look of the special, which revolved around Chewbacca rushing home to celebrate Wookiee Christmas, or Life Day. While the producers managed to get a hesitant Carrie Fisher and the rest of the central cast on board, much of the world-building was left up to the writers and crew, who had to source their own aliens from secondhand shops. And this, with Vilanch’s help, led to outrageous moments like a strikingly vaginal creature, whom the writers nicknamed C*ntface, appearing alongside Bea Arthur doing a floor show for patrons of the Mos Eisley cantina.

“We were out at the Warner Bros. studio in Burbank, and it was September, and the sun was pounding down. Air-conditioning could do just so much when combined with bright lights, heavy costumes and prosthetics …. We were losing aliens by the hours,” Vilanch writes of filming the scene in which the “vagina doppelgänger” and future star of “The Golden Girls” found themselves side by side as numbers dwindled.

“Each time one of them went down, I would quietly move C*ntface closer to Bea,” he writes. “Finally, it was just the two of them in the frame, C*ntface and Bea. We were that underpopulated.”

Of course, Vilanch doesn’t blame the entire thing on Lucas’ absence, his own antics, or the producers who devised solutions like guest stars translating for the otherwise unintelligible Wookiees and having Jefferson Airplane dropped in as a hologram. The people most to blame for the infamous reputation of “The Star Wars Holiday Special,” he implies, are the legions of fans who rediscovered and circulated the program online years later.

“As I said in the book, you have to remember Star Wars had not yet become the Scientology of the nerds. That happened after people could get the movies on tape. And then, the internet happened, and they could discover this thing,” Vilanch said.

“At the time, it was just another weirdo special cooked up by people doing drugs in Hollywood. That was the perception. We weren’t really committing a crime against the cultural nation,” he added, noting that, in the years and Star Wars off-shoots since, Lucas “won’t let go” of finding vehicles for his Wookiee holiday.

Space Bandits, Disco, and a Severed Head

People who pick up Vilanch’s slim text and expect him to show remorse for helping usher questionable content into the world will be disappointed. The veteran TV and stage writer is much more interested in bouncing between the weird circumstances surrounding a spattering of his less-acclaimed work, including the 1976 variety-show-turned-special “Charo” and a never-developed Channing-led sitcom named “Henne.” Though occasionally, he uses the book to explain why some of the ideas, like the 1978 musical “Platinum” and 1984’s “The Ice Pirates,” were either not so bad or could have been better than they turned out.

“‘Platinum’ was ahead of its time. It was not executed well, but it was a terrific idea — for something,” Vilanch said of the near-success of his Broadway debut featuring an aging film star attempting a comeback disco album, insisting it could be resurrected if everyone who remembers the ‘40s wasn’t “in assisted living somewhere.”

“‘Ice Pirates’ was neither fish nor fowl. It had a question of tone, but people don’t generally say, ‘God, that was awful.’ They say, ‘Well, that was fun, but I can’t believe that it got made,” he said of the film about space bandits targeting frozen water, in which he played a severed head opposite Anjelica Huston. “And as I said in the book, it was a half-assed hit. It actually opened pretty well — when movies were allowed to do that.”

While “Platinum” and “The Ice Pirates” are framed as forgivable — if only audiences would agree — there is one historic onstage gaffe that even Vilanch can’t pardon: the opening number of the 1989 Academy Awards ceremony.

A Stroke… of Genius

In the final pages of “It Seemed Like a Bad Idea at the Time,” Vilanch walks readers through “Grease” producer Alan Carr’s solo mission to recreate the long-running San Francisco revue “Beach Blanket Babylon” for confused audiences everywhere. As he tells it, he and ceremony co-writer Hildy Parks repeatedly tried to talk Carr out of the elaborate 1989 Oscars number that involved Snow White hobnobbing onstage with Merve Griffin, old Hollywood legends, and Rob Lowe. But like many of the other big personalities in Vilanch’s book, Carr was not one to question a scheme once it took hold — as the chapter on the 1980 film “Can’t Stop the Music,” a fictional origin story of the Village People, also demonstrates.

“Alan didn’t entertain a lot of questions when he was high on something, and I’m not talking drugs. If he was, like Mel Brooks’ creation Roger De Bris in ‘The Producers,’ in the throes of a stroke … of genius, he was phoning it in from a different plane of reality,” writes Vilanch, who was eventually taken off the script for asking to be paid for repeated rewrites, but not before Carr convinced him to do one draft from a “fat farm” in North Carolina.

Like the “Beach Blanket Babylon” tribute, which prompted a swift lawsuit from Disney, Carr blindly pursued “Can’t Stop the Music,” which he conjured up during a night out dancing to the Village People with Vilanch, Jacqueline Bisset, and Bronté Woodward, who was recruited to co-write the film. The script went through various iterations after Bisset, Olivia Newton-John, and a string of other leading ladies passed on the film. But neither the long road to filming nor the exit of the group’s lead singer, Victor Willis, during preproduction deterred the producer. By a sheer force of will, the film, starring Valerie Perrine as a fashion model who discovers the Village People and Steve Guttenberg as a music producer who helps them rise to fame, released a month before “Xanadu” and instantly bombed in theaters — as the story goes.

“[A bad idea] starts at the root. When they say ‘rotten to the core,’ they’re not kidding,” Vilanch said.

“I mean, something starts out and you just kind of know. When you say to yourself, ‘Gee, the Village People as movie stars with Olivia Newton-John, this is either going to be the greatest thing ever or the worst thing ever,’ the idea that it will turn out great is very slim compared to the idea that it will not,” he said.” “You just stubbornly refuse to acknowledge that, and you boldly go.”

https://indiewire.com,Duke Johnson Left Film School Assumptions Behind for His Hypnotic Live-Action ‘The Actor’,https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/duke-johnson-the-actor-interview-1235102790/,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 19:00:00 GMT","One of the great pleasures of director Duke Johnson‘s haunting and beautiful new film “The Actor” is, appropriately enough given the film’s title, the abundance of terrific performances. André Holland anchors the movie as the title character, an actor struggling to figure out who he is and where he belongs after an accident leaves him with amnesia. He’s surrounded by a gallery of equally fascinating supporting players — most of whom play multiple characters, with the actors often unrecognizable under layers of elaborate hair and makeup.

For Johnson, the decision to create a troupe of actors who would play different characters throughout was both practical and philosophical. “There are the limitations of shooting in Europe and getting your actors,” Johnson told IndieWire on an upcoming episode of the Filmmaker Toolkit podcast, noting that getting a huge cast to Budapest for production would have been prohibitively expensive — once he got talented performers like Tracey Ullman and Toby Jones to the location, why not use them as much as possible?

But having each actor play different people Holland interacts with on his journey served a deeper conceptual purpose as well, having to do with the ideas raised by the Donald Westlake novel (“Memory”) on which Johnson and co-writer Stephen Cooney based their screenplay. “There’s the theme of acting and how we’re all playing roles in our daily lives,” Johnson said. “It leans into the idea of ‘What can you really trust?'”

‘The Actor‘ NEON

The effect on the audience is hypnotic, and at times disorienting, making “The Actor” a profoundly subjective viewing experience as we’re sucked into the lead character’s point of view. As actors reemerge in different guises, there’s a sense of déjà vu exacerbated by the film’s approach to production design. Multiple sets are repurposed to serve as different locations — again, a financially sensible decision that also carries deep emotional resonance.

Johnson’s background is in stop-motion animation — he’s best known for co-directing “Anomalisa” with Charlie Kaufman — and he found that directing the actors in his first live-action feature was a far cry from what he had experienced in his previous work. “In animation, you do voice records, and there’s a lot of opportunity for actors to contribute, but then you take that and make the film and the performance doesn’t change much after that point,” Johnson said. “Making a live-action film, it’s evolving on a daily basis.”

Johnson also discovered that the time pressures in live action made his job exponentially more difficult than on a painstaking project like “Anomalisa.” “I was like, ‘I’m not going to do another stop-motion movie,’ because they’re too hard to make,” Johnson said. “And then I did a live-action movie, and they’re so hard! Because you have no time. It’s like a ticking clock, and if something goes wrong, it’s really, really challenging. Sometimes things aren’t working and you have to stop and figure it out with your collaborators, but sometimes there’s just not time to do that.”

The biggest thing Johnson learned on his first foray into live-action was to leave some of his film school assumptions behind. “I come from a pretentious background where coverage is for losers, or not for artists,” he said. “There’s a David Fincher quote that there are two ways to shoot a scene, and one of them is wrong. And I would just say, get some fucking coverage. You need it to control pacing and to have something to cut to in the editing room. If you shoot digitally, it’s so easy to throw in another camera — even if you know the shot you want to get, cover it with something else if you can.”

https://indiewire.com,Producer Rick McCallum Says Lucas’ Scrapped Live-Action TV Series Would Have Nixed Disney ‘Star Wars’ Purchase,https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/george-lucas-nixed-live-action-star-wars-tv-show-underworld-1235103219/,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 22:30:00 GMT","“There’s always a little bit of truth in legends,” Ahsoka once said on “Star Wars: Rebels.”

That line was a little Easter Egg to fans to assuage them about how the pre-Disney takeover “Star Wars” stories — told in decades-worth of novels, comics, and video games — might still live on in the official canon. It also applies a bit to the show “Star Wars: Underworld,” George Lucas‘s ambitious, but ultimately scrapped live-action TV series he was developing in the years after “Star Wars: Episode III — Revenge of the Sith” hit theaters in 2005.

Little bits of information have leaked about the show over the years. One thing was certain: Per its title, it was set in the demimonde of the galaxy far, far away, among its scoundrels, and smugglers, and bounty hunters and assorted other criminals. But now Rick McCallum, the producer best associated with the “Star Wars” prequels, who oversaw the production of those films at Lucasfilm with Lucas himself directing, is opening up a bit more about what the series would have represented.

On the “Young Indy Chronicles” podcast — McCallum entered the Lucasfilm fold as a producer on the ’90s show, which arguably bears many tonal similarities to the prequels — the producer said that it “would’ve blown up the whole ‘Star Wars’ universe and Disney would’ve definitely never offered George to buy the franchise.”

IndieWire’s request for comment to Lucasfilm about this podcast have gone unanswered.

Part of that might have been simply due to the cost. He said on the podcast that they couldn’t figure out how to do each episode for less than $40 million (and if we know anything, the cost-conscience Disney isn’t willing to invest too much more in shows that go over budget — just look at “The Acolyte”). “The problem was that each episode was bigger than the films,” he said. “So the lowest I could get it down to with the each [installment] that existed then was $40 million an episode.”

McCallum also said that “These were dark. They were sexy. They were violent. They were absolutely wonderful, complicated, challenging scripts.” Over the years “Star Wars: Underworld” had been referred to as Lucas trying to do “The Sopranos” in “Star Wars.” And as time has elapsed since the show simply proved too expensive to make and a broadcast partner was never lined up, more details have emerged here and there.

Among them, “Star Trek” writer and “Battlestar Galactica” showrunner Ronald D. Moore, who went on to showrun “Outlander” instead, was one of the writers on “Underworld” — given the extraordinary complexity he gave “Galactica” as well as episodes of “The Next Generation,” “Deep Space Nine,” and his all-timer of a script with Brannon Braga for “Star Trek: First Contact,” the idea of him being involved in “Star Wars” is a “could have been” for the ages.

McCallum went so far as to say they had 60 episode scripts to at least the third-draft stage — it’s believed Lucas planned for the show to run over 100 episodes, much as he had planned for the “Star Wars: The Clone Wars” animated series that launched in 2008 — it achieved that feat, ultimately clocking in at 133 installments. He departed the company following the Disney acquisition in October 2012.

Getting back to the meaning of that Ahsoka quote that fans have always embraced: That the stories developed in “Star Wars” before Disney have always found a way of bubbling back somehow — just look at how the non-canon Grand Admiral Thrawn, introduced in a popular series of books in 1991, made his way into the official canon in the “Rebels” show and then “Ahsoka” itself. It’s believed that elements of “Underworld” may have popped up in the Disney properties that have been produced since and we just haven’t known it.

We do know “Rogue One” was a project pitched to Lucasfilm pre-Disney by VFX wiz John Knoll, who told IndieWire in 2017 that the idea was conceived as an “Underworld” installment. Germain Lussier at Slashfilm said “Underworld” would have explored Han Solo’s origins… might that have morphed into “Solo: A Star Wars Story”? Even the idea of focusing on the criminal underworld is something “Underworld” had in common with “The Mandalorian,” while “The Bad Batch” animated series and “Andor” went on to explore the same time period “Underworld” ostensibly would have.

“Underworld” seems like an incredible lost opportunity that was a few years ahead of its time. But we might have watched more of it than we realize.",indiewire
https://indiewire.com,‘Daredevil: Born Again’ Episode 3 Embraces the Courtroom Drama,https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/shows/daredevil-born-again-303-review-1235102982/,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 18:30:00 GMT","[Editor’s note: The following article contains spoilers for “Daredevil: Born Again” through Season 1, Episode 3.]

There are few things as satisfying as a courtroom drama. From the tradition of “12 Angry Men” to “Juror #2” and even the recent, twisted version on “Yellowjackets,” this dramatic sub-genre exemplifies that formula can be consistently entertaining in the right hands.

I read a tweet many years ago about how the best Marvel movies are something else at their core: “Winter Soldier” is a spy thriller, “Ant-Man” is a heist film, “Spider-Man: Homecoming” is a teen comedy, and so on. “Daredevil: Born Again” Season 1, Episode 3 is a full-tilt courtroom drama that expertly opens up further storylines while wrapping up its main arc.

After learning that his client Hector (Kamar de los Reyes) is the vigilante known as White Tiger, Matt (Charlie Cox) has his hands full trying to keep the secret and still prepare his defense. He believes that Hector is a good and innocent man, but no one involved is naive enough to think that’s enough to sway a jury. If Officer Powell’s attempts at intimidation are any indication, they’ve both invoked the wrath of the NYPD which will make the trial and its fallout even more dangerous.

The trial unfolds in predictable but satisfying fashion. There’s a de facto villain with Officer Powell (Hamish Allan-Headley), who intimidates Matt outside of the courtroom and tries to prevent star witness Nicky (Nick Jordan) from taking the stand. There’s the consistently strong performance of John Benjamin Hickey as D.A. Hochberg, as committed to a fierce closing argument as to telling Matt he will have A.D.A.s “up his ass” for the forseeable future.

And then there’s Matt’s hail Mary of putting Hector on the stand to let his character alone sway the jury — repeating “It’s the right thing to do” is so deeply hokey and yet stunning in de los Reyes’ hands — a risk that should never have paid off, and its success has the desired effect of invoking unease for the character’s future. Outing Hector as White Tiger puts his life in danger, as does his freedom for people like Powell who take it as a personal insult — and the final moments drive that heartbreakingly home.

The show isn’t being subtle about the parallels between Matt and Wilson Fisk (Vincent D’Onofrio), nor does it intend to. They’re both teetering on the edge of the personas they claim to have abandoned, as evidenced at the top of this episode by the scrapes on their knuckles.

But the end of this episode highlights their differences: where the retired Devil of Hell’s Kitchen opens up about his grief to his new partner, the artist formerly known as Kingpin gives an interview about the rule of law. Matt’s walls are coming down, and Fisk’s are growing stronger.

I love the “BB on the street” interstitials, which remind me of Sam Raimi’s “Spider-Man.”

You know who’s gotta be pissed about the price of eggs right now? Wilson freaking Fisk.

“The best cure for a black eye is fast hands.” Matthew, you absolute savage.

Hector’s killer is, in fact, wearing Frank Castle’s (Jon Bernthal) Punisher logo. FRANK, WHY?

Disney+ started to autoplay “Marvel’s Daredevil” from Netflix right after this, as I’m sure you all experienced. On the one hand, “Born Again” is achieving the desired effect because I went ahead and clicked “play”,” but it took mere seconds to yearn for the rich visual palette of that show.

https://indiewire.com,‘Death of a Unicorn’ Review: ‘Knives Out’ Meets ‘Jurassic Park’ to Agonizingly Unfunny Results in Big Pharma Satire,https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/death-of-a-unicorn-review-1235103055/,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 16:00:00 GMT","Eat-the-rich satires go back to the supposed dinosaur days of cinema, from Luis Buñuel to Jean Renoir, but they’re as in demand as ever thanks to the worlds, desperately populated by wealthy delusionals, created by Rian Johnson in his scalding and adored “Knives Out” movies. That many contemporary filmmakers are eager to jump on that tradition thanks to the latter films’ streaming (and no longer especially theatrical) success has led to results both punching and effective (“Ready or Not”) and severely undercooked (“The Menu”).

Enter Alex Scharfman’s “Death of a Unicorn” into that fray, an agonizingly unfunny send-up of big pharma and “Jurassic Park”-scale tentpoles that has none of the tooth or wit of any of the movies I just mentioned.

Here, en route to a weekend retreat in Canada to become proxy to a pharmaceutical billionaire (Richard E. Grant), the feckless Elliot (Paul Rudd) and his Gen Z, internet-warrior-pilled daughter Ridley (Jenna Ortega) accidentally hit and kill a unicorn with their rental car. But not before Ridley gets the chance to touch its psychedelia-inducing horn, and form psychically linked powers of her own to the mythical creature.

The unicorn’s radiance has the power to heal everything from Ridley’s teenage acne to Elliot’s poor-sightedness, which turns this unicorn into an inevitable potential cash cow for pharma CEO Odell Leopold, his pleated-short-wearing son Shepard (Will Poulter), and freshly blown-out wife Belina (Téa Leoni). This, and more, they learn upon arriving at the Leopolds’ many-acred estate, where company lawyer Elliot is negotiating to take a significant partnership in the enterprise because Odell is dying of terminal cancer.

But the unicorn population at large running about the wilds surrounding the Leopolds’ posh, secluded ranch compound is none too happy with the fact that one of their brood has now died by oligarchical hands. And so an uprising ensues where the rest of the unicorns attack and eliminate the Leopolds in grisly fashion, making for a confused mix of horror and comedy, ever a tricky knife’s edge (or unicorn’s tooth) upon which to dance. Writer/director Scharfman, whose feature directing debut teams him with, among other production companies, Ari Aster’s Square Peg, offers a potentially intriguing concept but one that only scratches the surface of unicorn lore, or the characters inhabiting this film, or the creature features this one wants to emulate.

Leoni seems to have fun in a jumpsuit and bumped-up hairdo, doting on her son Shepard, who’s recovering from drug addiction, as ever the prodigal children of rich parents with nothing better to do are. “Barry” breakout Anthony Carrigan gets the majority of the best laughs in the film, here playing a put-upon butler who, when asked to unlock the Leopolds’ gate during a moment of particular crisis, is told by Belina, “Years of service, and we’ve asked nothing of you!” But the upstairs-downstairs satire only goes about as deep as that, as the Leopolds get greedy about the unicorn’s potential to stop their patriarch’s cancer, its blood something they can perhaps peddle to the rich billionaires of the rest of the world for a sickness cure-all.

Ridley, traumatized by the cancer death of her mother and considered mostly a wastrel by those around her for pursuing a degree in the dread-inducing major of art history, knows a thing or two about the mythology behind these kindly rainbow-spewing creatures. If only anyone would listen to her! It becomes all too late once Shepard realizes that a fair-haired maiden such as Ridley could be the one to save them, and the unicorns encircle the Leopolds’ home and go in for a series of “Final Destination”-level kills.

It’s hard to tell if the shoddiness of the digital effects is intentional, serving to remind that this is a horror-comedy, not a horror movie. There is some hilarity to the kills, like when poor Dr. Bhatia (Sunita Mani) meets an unexpected fate. And perhaps, even, some satisfaction once the smugness of these people is wiped right off their faces and gutted from their insides. “Death of a Unicorn” doesn’t cheap out on intestines spilling out of bodies or sudden impailings that instantly obliterate people the movie has trained us to hate.

The lurching between genres, whether horror or comedy or heartfelt father-daughter movie, becomes increasingly transparent and frustrating as the movie tries to win our hearts back over with sentimental weepie moments in the film’s last act. The problem is we don’t really care who lives or dies, unless it’s, of course, these horrible rich people getting stabbed to death by unicorn horns.

The only entities this movie makes you feel for are its creatures, however unbelievably realized they are. Was that the film’s point? Scharfman may see humans as pitiful beings under a magnifying glass meant to be evaporated and punished for their hubris, but his point of view is far less clear.

https://indiewire.com,‘Ash’ Review: Flying Lotus’ Pummeling Sci-Fi Freak Out Stars Eiza González and Aaron Paul as Astronauts in Hell,https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/ash-movie-review-flying-lotus-eiza-gonzalez-aaron-paul-1235103042/,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 14:15:00 GMT","Usually, when someone says a movie is “all vibes,” they mean it as an insult. But vibes can accomplish some wonderful things: Just ask Alejandro Jodorowsky, Dario Argento, Amy Seimetz, Panos Cosmatos, and now Flying Lotus. Born Steven D. Bingley-Ellison, the musician and record producer claims his place in the pantheon of vibes-based filmmakers with “Ash,” a pummeling psychedelic sci-fi freakout that one doesn’t watch so much as experience.

Don’t let the green mist tinged with white lightning and rotating cosmic orifices fool you, however: Ingesting psychedelic drugs is not recommended before watching this film. Like Brandon Cronenberg’s “Possessor,” “Ash” makes extensive use of cut-ins that violently tear through the frame, jarring the audience with nightmarish imagery that’s disarming under normal circumstances and probably soul-searingly terrifying if one’s third eye happens to be open at the time. Think rage monsters — coated in blood that’s as thick as crude oil — who scream under red lights as the score spikes in the background. It’s very much a horror movie, and a freaky one at times.

I saw this film stone-cold sober and sufficiently caffeinated at its world premiere at SXSW, and still had trouble figuring out what was going on throughout a lot of it. This was true even when one of the characters explicitly explained what was going on, which happens quite a bit — this is writer Jonni Remmler’s first produced screenplay, and it shows. But there aren’t too many dialogue scenes, thankfully, as heroine Riya (Eiza González) spends a good deal of the movie alone, walking through the husk of a wrecked spaceship after waking up bruised and bloody, trying to figure out who she is and who all these dead bodies around her used to be.

Then Aaron Paul shows up as a previously unseen member of the ship’s crew, and if you’ve ever seen an “Alien” movie you’ll know immediately that this guy should not be trusted. The “Alien” series is a prominent influence on “Ash,” showing up everywhere from a scene of working-class astronauts cracking jokes over dinner to the tank tops and tight white T-shirts that make up González’s wardrobe. Riya is a Ripley type, and although her head injury and subsequent amnesia keep her from being as clever as Sigourney Weaver’s iconic sci-fi heroine, she shows an equal amount of grit in a climactic sequence involving a flamethrower and the cosmic anemone Riya just excised from her brain.

That creature combines invertebrate goo with magnetic liquid metal, an example of the many visual textures Flying Lotus plays with in “Ash.” The attention to detail is impressive: An insectoid mobile surgery unit projects vaporwave grids onto its patients, and although the display screen is in English — flashing text that says “Sorry for Your Loss” when the device scans a dead body provides one of the film’s few laughs — the audio prompts are in Japanese, presumably because it sounds cool. Attention is paid to sound as well as to visuals, and Flying Lotus’ score is excellent, a head-nodding blend of pulsating rhythms, abrasive noise, and atmospheric synths.

The last twenty minutes or so of “Ash” are violent and intense, with little time to stop and appreciate the retro-futuristic set design, gel lighting, and bloody gore effects. This is where the montage sequences get really aggressive, assaulting the viewer with imagery of barren alien landscapes and skulls with the flesh melting off of their faces. (Again, psychonauts should proceed with caution.) Combined with first-person action sequences that play like they were filmed through a VR headset, it’s all quite dizzying — one audience member at my screening spent much of the film with his head between his knees.

No worries, though, because the circular flashback structure ensures that we get to see most of the coolest images twice, first out of context and again in slightly more coherent fashion later on. The emphasis there is on “slightly.” Core themes of space colonization and human survival instincts translate clearly. But keeping track of the characters can be difficult, given that we spend barely any time with them pre-alien attack and that many of them are wearing matching space suits in pivotal scenes.

The type of moviegoer who leans over to ask their seat mate what’s happening will be lost almost immediately. And trying to fight this film’s sensations, as unpleasant as they may be at times, will bring nothing but misery. So just give in, vibe out, and take solace in the fact that “Ash” is way more accessible than Flying Lotus’ first film.

Grade: B-

https://indiewire.com,‘The Python Hunt’ Review: This Insane Look at an All-Night Snake-Hunting Contest Might Be the Next ‘Tiger King’,https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/the-python-hunt-documentary-review-1235102930/,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 18:30:00 GMT","You can’t have a picnic at the beach and then be upset when seagulls show up. And when you advertise a free-for-all python hunting contest offering cash to anyone willing to run through swamps in the middle of the night and bring back deadly snakes, you really have no right to complain when strange characters start appearing on your doorstep.

But it’s not like I have a better idea for culling the invasive Burmese python population in the Florida Everglades. Since 1992, when Hurricane Andrew ripped through Miami during a wildlife convention and released foreign species into the state’s swamps, these strangling snakes have been reproducing in the Everglades and feasting on native species. The vast majority of Florida preservation enthusiasts want these intruders gone — as do the vast majority of normal people, who don’t need a principled reason for preferring not to live anywhere near 20-foot pythons.

The prevalence of pythons, and the difficulty of removing them, has spawned a cottage industry of python hunters. The state of Florida has been willing to pay licensed professionals to spend their nights driving through deserted roads in the Everglades looking for these snakes and bringing them back dead. Eventually, some brilliant bureaucrats realized that humans are motivated by competition, and the Florida Python Challenge was born. Each October, Florida invites professional and amateur python hunters from around the world into the Everglades for a 10-night competition to see who can remove the most nocturnal snakes. The results are ultimately a drop in the bucket — most contests remove a couple hundred pythons from a population of several hundred thousand — but goddamn, does it make for some entertaining cinema.

Xander Robin’s documentary “The Python Hunt” follows a coterie of misfits who descend upon the Everglades to compete in the festivities. The ensemble of characters making up the Florida-fied “Cannonball Run” include Anne, a widowed grandmother and self-described “nature lover” who decides to enter the contest as one final adventure and demonstrates a sadistic obsession with stabbing pythons through the brain; Toby Benoit, a tobacco-chewing journalist and swamp enthusiast who offers to be Anne’s chaperone; and Jimbo, a local python hunting enthusiast who is so bitter about being banned from the event over cheating allegations that he spends his days making fake pythons to fool the out-of-state tourists that he looks down upon.

The hunters spend 10 nights prowling the back roads of the Everglades with the hope of reeling in the biggest snakes they can find, often demonstrating a blatant disregard for personal safety. The film features some impressive moments of snake spectacle, but the real attraction is the human drama that emerges from the larger-than-life personalities. Everyone has different motives, from principled preservationists to sadistic killers to observers who just look for different species like they’re playing a big game of Pokemon Go. And while it can be hilarious to see how much of their identity some people get from their status within a niche world of snake-hunting, the film does make space for some larger conversations about the role that extermination plays in preservation.

There’s no denying that the pythons pose a real threat to Florida’s ecosystems, but different voices in the python hunting community have different opinions about how to deal with it. Some feel that the gamified aspect of these hunting contests bring the wrong kind of people out of the woodwork, and giving them permission to kill pythons will eventually lead to them hurting the species we want to preserve. Others feel that government officials use the python problem as a sensational story to pull attention away from bigger environmental issues like pollution. And some are so libertarian in their approach to snake hunting that they think the government should play no role and simply leave Florida natives to tend to their own swamps. The conversations are fascinating, but it does sometimes feel like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic, as there has never been a successful removal of an invasive reptile population and the pythons are breeding much faster than anyone in Florida can get rid of them.

Nothing is ever certain in the world of film distribution, but I would be stunned if “The Python Hunt” doesn’t get picked up by a streamer and become at least a minor cultural phenomenon. The premise is too compelling and the characters are too zany for it not to crack the mainstream in some way. The “Florida Man Does Crazy Shit” trope has become overplayed in recent years (and if your bandwidth for such discourse is truly spent, perhaps seek your entertainment elsewhere), but “The Python Hunt” just might be the rare project that’s indescribable enough to break through a saturated niche and become the next “Tiger King.”

Grade: B+

https://indiewire.com,Will American Audiences Turn Out for ‘On Becoming a Guinea Fowl’? Rungano Nyoni and Susan Chardy Make the Case for Their Zambian Gem,https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/on-becoming-a-guinea-fowl-rungano-nyoni-susan-chardy-interview-1235102562/,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 13:00:00 GMT","The mile-a-minute banter and easy repartee between Rungano Nyoni and Susan Chardy, the Zambian British director and lead actor, respectively, of “On Becoming a Guinea Fowl,” belies the “incandescent furious[ness]” that runs through Nyoni’s surreal follow-up to “I Am Not a Witch.”

“On Becoming a Guinea Fowl” premiered last May in Cannes’ Un Certain Regard section, and is now playing in theaters across the U.S. In doing so, it joins a tiny handful of films from Sub-Saharan Africa, especially those directed by diasporic Black women, to secure a release stateside.

Nyoni’s resort to endearing guinea fowl local pop culture references has a forceful absurdist denouement, not dissimilar to how she lured the goat’s bleat in “I Am Not a Witch.” Both films sharply critique the culture-specific contradictions that constitute a fragile matriarchal solidarity among women and girls in Zambia.

In “On Becoming a Guinea Fowl,” protagonist Shula (played by Chardy) is forced to confront the mausoleum of silence perpetuated by her aunties during a suffocating, seemingly endless funeral that she hosts after she discovers her Uncle Fred’s dead body lying on a deserted and discomfortingly well-lit stretch of highway, as she returns home from a costume party, rocking Missy Elliott’s iconic and futurist “The Rain” headgear.

Shula slows down the car, and then seems to stop entirely, as she is figuratively mummified for the rest of “On Becoming a Guinea Fowl,” with her risible cousin Nsansa (played with electric vulnerability by Elizabeth Chisela) her only ally in face of an ever ballooning brood of mother figures, crawling, genuflecting, wailing — funereal idiosyncrasies are a theme in another recent festival hit set in India — but also pointing angry shushing fingers at their nieces. Uncle Fred’s life was pristine, no one else better know better!

In a freewheeling interview with IndieWire, Nyoni reveals her playful and rebellious side as auteur, as she dissects some the artful indulgences she had to scale back on, whereas Chardy, a free-spirited antonym of Shula, attempts to reconcile her own upbringing in England with her character’s proclivities to internalize. The two tease each other and laugh about production behind-the-scenes, even as they notably differ in their core philosophical outlooks about any “agency” — a concept Nyoni hints feels foreign — wielded by younger Zambian women to outwit the coils and embroils of silence.

This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity and length.

IndieWire: It’s been long journey since Cannes. How were you feeling before the U.S. premiere?

Rungano Nyoni: What I want to enjoy is that it is very rare for a film from the continent to get shown in America, in cinemas. I don’t care even if it is just one or two [screens]. The intention to release in cinemas fills with so much pride. It’s a film from Zambia, in Bemba! It’s mind-boggling!

Susan Chardy: I was lucky to go to the New York Film Festival. People there got the film and asked really great questions. I hope other people in America feel the same way. I’d like to put my full house on the table and say that I’d find it very hard to believe if someone would see the film and walk away with nothing.

At the beginning, we see Shula driving alone at night on a deserted highway, returning from a fancy dress party, when she spots her uncle’s body. She is rocking Missy Elliott’s iconic headgear from “The Rain.” I am curious about that Shula and the world of the fancy dress party, so different from the one she is be dragged into for the rest of the film.

Nyoni: I had actually written a scene set in the fancy dress party. But you always ask yourself, “Why am I showing this?” To show Shula is happy, and then suddenly sad? It’s not that simple. It felt cheap. The other thing, if you shoot the fancy dress party, then people will compare: “Oh, this is a film about modernity vs. tradition.” So I had her start off in the car, and you get an inkling of her life while she is inside the vehicle. But Zambia is contradiction of traditions, of ideas, things that live next to each other. So in the beginning, it does look like she’s coming from a different place, a bombastic one.

Chardy: For the rest of the film, she’s internalizing, she’s looking after everyone else. In that moment [in the beginning], she’s a just girl who has fun with her friends. She’s wearing such a bold outfit, it has to be a certain kind of fun person who would embrace that.

The world-building is so notable. I was struck by the contrast between the emptiness of that opening road, and the dark interiors later, with the gradual encroachment of aunties, and surrealist scenes with the flooded dorm and kitchen. What was your thinking behind this, and how did you collaborate with David Gallego, your DP?

Nyoni: We wanted to find more ways of trapping Shula. [One way was] through the limit set by the darkness. It became more dark than we had originally written, so we were always questioning if we should switch on the lights. In the end, I chose to have them off. David and I don’t like coverage, so we had to be very strict about how we framed. We always talked about cutting off Shula’s head or filming her from behind, to make her feel more trapped. I knew in the first shot she had to be trapped. And I wanted the last shot to be very different. [But in the end, we realized] we just need to see her face more [laughs]. So we had to do reshoots. That was a hard lesson.

There is so much rich cultural subtext throughout, especially in the hierarchy and relationships among all the aunties and cousins. An international audience might enjoy but not understand everything a Zambian viewer would. Can you elaborate on what else is playing out here?

Nyoni: There’s actually two Zambian languages being spoken. Shula’s bougie family speaks Bemba. I’m Bemba too. We are the equivalent of the English people, the oppressors in a way [laughs]. People get frustrated since we take up all the high positions. It is changing, though. The widow’s family is definitely from another tribe. They speak Nyanja. The aunties weaponize this against her and isolate her further. So yes, you wouldn’t know that if you saw that.

[At the same time], I don’t want to be anthropological. There are only some things where I feel contextualizing helps. People have fought me on this. Executive producers and financiers were like, “We need to know what is happening.” But I didn’t know anything about your [thing] but I still accepted it. No one said yellow cars were taxis, so why am I contextualizing anything? It’s about being clever enough to write a bit more context without being patronizing or over-explaining. I do sometimes go the other way too much though.

Susan, what about Shula could you relate to and not relate to? How did you think Shula felt when all these aunties were coming at her, starting with the early hotel room scene?

Chardy: I could relate to the sense of responsibility she had and the weight of what she carried within her family. She’s always the one that’s fixing stuff. She could easily have said, “I come from the UK, from the West. I don’t want to do this.” But then she’s the one in the pantry who decides to cook for the widow. She’s the carer, the big sister. I’m oldest in my family, so I know what that’s like. In the end, with [her cousins] Bupe and Nsansa, we have a sisterhood, which is a catalyst to this movement within ourselves to effect change.

The biggest thing I didn’t relate to was Shula’s internalizing pretty much everything. I am an oversharer. I love people. If they become my friend, they really become my friend. [Yet] it was really interesting to dive into this space of processing things so differently than my own. There was a sense of love for her, care for her. I wanted to protect Shula. Because who is protecting her? I felt that watching the film in Cannes, where both Rungano and I were in tears at the end.

The aunties, my God, were wonderful women to work with! All different, and just so committed to the film and the role. Sometimes we’d be off-camera, and they’d still be at each other. It was comical. But that scene with them in the hotel room, there was this sense of me being lowered. They are physically descending at me. Their voices are descending at me. It needed to be like that because at the end of the day, you would not disrespect your elders in our culture. Even if you mean well by it.

Speaking of Shula being on the floor, one of the most striking moments is toward the middle, when the funeral is well on its way. It’s an overhead shot of Shula standing over the aunties, watching them all sleep on the floor in a formation. Visually, it feels like a slight shift in the power dynamic, but we soon know it wasn’t.

Nyoni: Yes, it wasn’t a shift. It shouldn’t be that the aunts would be on the floor. It’s the first time you feel Shula’s going to do something. I was trying to show why you’re so complicit to the silence in this culture. It’s a reflection of my own indecisiveness. This is what my friends from different cultures find frustrating about me. But my own cousins are all trapped in the same way. My cousin’s a doctor, my sister’s a lawyer. Lawyers, doctors, film directors, all stuck in a room, unable to even exert ourselves [in front of our mothers and aunties], in a way that just doesn’t compute with a lot of people.

The whole film is an expression of my own self. Susan is very different from me. I am a closed book. [She looks at Chardy and laughs, Chardy laughs back.] So you basically played me. For me, it’s a conversation about how not everybody can speak up, and why. So I tease [that she will] and then she doesn’t. I wanted people to be frustrated by her. That’s the first thing they ask women, “Why didn’t you say something?” But that’s what’s different about my film. Shula did speak up when she was young [to her mother, as is later revealed]. The twist is that they all knew. You have to deal with the shame of people knowing that. That’s what keeps you more within yourself, somehow.

Susan, could you talk about how your worked with the wonderful Elizabeth Chisela, who plays your cousin Nsansa?

Chardy: Elizabeth grew up in Zambia. I left when I was quite young. So we had different upbringings, culturally. Stepping off the plane for the shoot, when I hadn’t been for a long time, felt like home. Meeting Elizabeth and everyone on set, we just kind of all got on. Elizabeth and I spent time off set, we’d text and we talked. She’s so funny, genius, the things she’d come up with! She jokes she actually wasn’t drunk in any of those scenes. Because Elizabeth and I had built this bond off set, it was nice to know we had each other’s backs when we got into working with our characters. Some scenes were really emotional, we sounded like kids. But the scene in the car, when Elizabeth is looking for something to cover the body, I could barely keep a straight face. If you had gone on a few seconds longer…

Nyoni: Yes, we had to cut off a few frames!

You start the film with a futuristic-looking Shula, so I was wondering what the future is for Shula. The last shot is memorable, it is absurd and surreal. But in a realist sense, I wanted to ask: Does Shula grow up to become like her aunties?

Nyoni: [Pauses] That’s a very good question. I don’t know. I hope not. The mothers — who are the aunties, we call them mothers — their power comes in how collective they are in their ideas and how they reinforce them amongst each other. [Our generation, the cousins], we are much more individualistic, we freestyle. The mothers grew up in the village together, so it’s like speaking to an eight-headed monster. You get all the versions of mother: the hardcore aunty, my mother was the soft one. But they all experience the same thing. They can’t not have. It is part of womanhood that you experience some kind of sexual harassment, sexual assault. They just deal with it with in a different way.

Would Shula be different? I think between the two of them [Shula and Nsansa], they could be a different voice. The difference between us and our mothers is that our mothers are trying to prepare us for a world we just we just refuse to inherit. They want to follow the status quo and we want to change it. They might have tried to change it and failed. As we see in our modern day society, women are still hackled, they’re still mocked if they come out with allegations. It’s still a very difficult hill to climb and they pay the price for it.

The mothers just want to push through and avoid harm. Would Shula do the same thing, avoiding harm? I like to think each generation is a step towards something more nuanced. Our mothers represent something much more different to what their grandmothers experienced, for example. Is it in a good direction? I don’t know, but it’s different.

Chardy: I’m naturally a very positive person. That last shot of us coming forward, I love that shot, yeah, but it’s not like, “Oh, The Avengers are coming in. It will all be fine now.” It’s not that simple. I get that. But for me, there’s so much coming out of those cries, that it’s impossible to imagine that nothing will be done going forward. [Uncle Fred’s death] started this motion for change. That could have been the gift from God. He’s not here, so what are you going to do with this?

For me, it would be strange for Shula to continue her life, have kids of her own, and do what her mother did to her. I feel there’s a sense of drive and determination in her that would try to not make the same mistake. I don’t wanna call it a mistake, because obviously we can’t judge what the mothers and the aunties have been through. But when it comes our generation, you are already sounding the alarm [in the last shot], you’ve got no choice, but to keep forward with it. The change starts here.

Nyoni: I think there’s a difference. Me and my sisters do talk more. We talk as much as probably our mothers do. But I think we are good at disagreeing more, and can still pick up ourselves afterwards. My mother and their generation is so secretive. My mom’s secretive about my own secrets! I have secrets I never had. I have eczema. She would be like, “Don’t tell anybody.” I’m like, “It’s my eczema.” [Chardy laughs] We have secrets about really odd things.

In my old age, I have just no time for it. But we’ve found ways to rebel, a Zambian way, it’s like passive resistance. We don’t announce that we are rebelling. We just don’t turn up for, or we just don’t turn up emotionally. We fight differently.

Amazon MGM optioned the rights to the book “The Tiger Slam: The Inside Story of the Greatest Golf Ever Played” by author Kevin Cook. The book was published in November 2024 and gives the behind-the-scenes story of how Woods in 2000, already having dominated the Masters earlier in his career, managed to win four major golf titles in a row that left all of his other rivals on the course in the dust.

Reinaldo Marcus Green, who directed the biopic “King Richard” about Venus and Serena Williams’ father that won Will Smith an Oscar, is in talks to direct the film.

Winkler Films is producing the project, but the Obamas’ Higher Ground is also in talks to board the project. Woods is one of the most accomplished Black athletes in any sport, so it’s not a surprise that the Obamas want to be involved. But Woods has been in the news quite a bit lately because of the recent headlines he’s made with the Trump administration: Woods golfed with Trump ahead of the Super Bowl in February, he spoke at an event at the White House honoring Black History Month, and he even got involved in some diplomacy in which Trump met with Woods and the chief of the Saudi Wealth Fund regarding the Saudi-backed LIV Golf tour.

Woods has been surrounded by off-the-course scandal, as well, and the later part of his career has been plagued by injuries. Just this week, he announced that he would undergo surgery to repair his Achilles, with many fearing that Woods may have played his last professional round of golf.

Cook is the author of “Tommy’s Honor,” which was adapted into a BAFTA-winning feature in 2016. Cook is represented by CAA and David Halpern at David Halpern Literary Management. “The Tiger Slam” is published by Avid Reader Press, an imprint of Simon & Schuster.

https://indiewire.com,Poker Face Season 2 Teaser: Natasha Lyonne Meets New Celeb Guest Stars,https://www.indiewire.com/news/trailers/poker-face-season-2-teaser-natasha-lyonne-1235102925/,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 15:30:00 GMT","Natasha Lyonne is back in the game of solving mysteries in Season 2 of “Poker Face.”

The star-studded, Emmy Award-winning original series returns with Lyonne’s Charlie Cale tackling a new mystery-of-the-week. Charlie has an extraordinary ability to know without fail when someone is lying, and now for this season, Charlie continues her journey on the road across the country, encountering a new cast of characters and investigating crimes along the way.

“Poker Face” previously received four Primetime Emmy nominations, including Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for Lyonne, and garnered Peacock its first Emmy win for Judith Light’s Outstanding Guest Actress Performance in a Comedy Series.

Lyonne is joined by a fresh crop of celeb guest stars for Season 2, ranging from “Wicked” actress Cynthia Erivo to comedian John Mulaney. The full list also includes Awkwafina, Ben Marshall, B.J. Novak, Cliff “Method Man” Smith, David Krumholtz, Davionte “GaTa” Ganter, Ego Nwodim, Gaby Hoffmann, Giancarlo Esposito, Jason Ritter, John Cho, Justin Theroux, Carol Kane, Kathrine Narducci, Corey Hawkins, Alia Shawkat, Haley Joel Osment, Katie Holmes, Simon Rex, Kevin Corrigan, Kumail Nanjiani, Margo Martindale, Melanie Lynskey, Patti Harrison, Sam Richardson, and Sherry Cola.

“We still can’t believe we got to work with rockstars like Cynthia Erivo, Katie Holmes, John Mulaney, and Awkwafina (and many many more, the list is kinda dizzying) who all dove into the game with joy and came ready to play,” Lyonne and series creator Rian Johnson wrote in a statement.

As the synopsis reads, Season 2 finds Charlie back on the run with a ’70s twist.

“We’ve taken her journey to the next level one murder mystery at a time,” Johnson and Lyonne said. “From minor league baseball to big box retail, from funeral homes to alligator farms and even a grade school talent show, Charlie navigates her crime solving existential road-trip with deadpan wit, human empathy, and her signature uncanny lie-detecting ability. 12 killer new episodes are coming your way. Buckle up and see you on the road!”

The duo continued, “To bring Season 2 to life, we pulled visual inspiration from American ’70s cinema, all the stuff we love like Robert Altman, Bob Rafelson, Peter Bogdanovich. But the backbone of this show is TV, the kind of TV we grew up watching, episodic case-of-the-week gems like ‘Columbo’ and ‘The Rockford Files’ and ‘Quantum Leap.’ Each episode is a mini-movie, existing in its own world with a unique tone and vibe, featuring an eccentric lot of characters played by a truly gonzo parade of guest stars.”

“Poker Face” is created by Johnson, who also writes, directs, and executive produces the Peacock series. Lyonne directs, writes, stars in, and executive produces. Tony Tost is the showrunner and executive producer of the show, with Ram Bergman, Nena Rodrigue, Adam Arkin, Nora Zuckerman, and Lilla Zuckerman also executive producing. “Poker Face” is a T-Street and MRC series, with T-Street and Animal Pictures producing.

“Poker Face” Season 2 premieres May 8 on Peacock with three episodes, followed by a new episode streaming Thursdays. Check out the teaser below.",indiewire

https://indiewire.com,‘Everybody’s Live with John Mulaney’ Turns a One-Off Experiment Into Consistently Delightful Chaos: TV Review,https://variety.com/2025/tv/reviews/john-mulaney-netflix-review-everybodys-live-1236335973/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 04:26:19 GMT","“Everybody’s Live with John Mulaney” isn’t quite a new show. Instead, the series is the evolution of “Everybody’s in LA,” a pop-up concept — and apparently, trial run — timed to the Netflix Is a Joke festival last year. After producing six episodes in eight days, Mulaney took 10 months to retool the series into something less hyper-regional but no less idiosyncratic.

“10 months is the perfect amount of time to forget how to do this show,” Mulaney joked in his monologue. But the next hour made clear the comedian and his collaborators forgot, and in fact changed, very little from that initial sprint. (That Mulaney referred to — and kept referring to — “Everybody’s in LA” as “this show,” not a separate one, was an accurate preview.) Richard Kind is still the announcer; the hour’s centerpiece is still an expanding panel pairing celebrities with non-famous experts in their field; Mulaney still asks callers what kind of car they drive, because while everybody may no longer be in LA, he certainly is. The ‘70s-inspired set on a Hollywood soundstage proved a metaphor for the transition from one-off experiment to a three-month run of a dozen weekly episodes: mostly the same, with minor tweaks only apparent to a small subset of nerdy aficionados.

That’s great news for fans like myself, having named “Everybody’s in LA” one of the best shows of last year in my annual roundup. It’s nonetheless surprising how non-expository Wednesday’s technical debut was. The presence of Saymo the delivery robot, for example, went unexplained. Mulaney’s four-wheeled friend needed no introduction for those who watched the bug-eyed apparatus develop into a full-fledged character last spring, but neophytes dropping in on a major launch from a worldwide streamer may have been left scratching their heads. Mulaney may have cracked that the name change came after focus groups showed audiences didn’t like LA, but nothing else about the show felt focus-grouped or planned with mass appeal in mind.

Popular on Variety

“Everybody’s Live” takes after its five-member panel, in part because the discussion took up the majority of the episode: often odd and offbeat, yet in a way that allows for a transcendent weirdness when the stars align. Without the ability to edit down and tighten a pre-taped segment, the chit-chat between actor Michael Keaton and personal finance columnist Jessica Roy on the night’s selected topic — lending money to friends and family — could wander aimlessly. (Keaton sort of flubbed his delivery of a story about Jack Nicholson’s “$500 junkie buyout” strategy, although his impression was pretty great.) Yet we were also treated to folk singer Joan Baez narrating the time she crashed her brand-new Tesla into an oak tree, much to the in-studio audience’s delight.

Part of what made “Everybody’s in LA” so exciting was in how it took the cultural decline of the talk show as an opportunity. Rather than subjecting itself to the endless grind of daily headlines or relying on stars’ promotional schedules to book guests, the show would embrace the niche fascination its genre was already trending toward — treating “talk show” like an aesthetic to be tried on and toyed with, not a set of expectations to be met. “Everybody’s Live” maintains this spirit of chaos and curiosity, with all the risks that come with it. Despite a more regular schedule than its predecessor, the show is in no danger of becoming Netflix’s answer to “Late Night” or “The Tonight Show.”

Broadening the focus from Los Angeles and its many contradictions to more general prompts has its growing pains. I didn’t feel the same infectious enthusiasm from Mulaney for financial etiquette as, say, the O.J. Simpson case. On the other hand, it would be difficult to shoehorn a Willy Loman focus group into a Southern California-themed broadcast. That sketch, coming just before the episode’s closing performance by Cypress Hill, was the hour’s peak, containing all the promise of petty obsessions afforded airtime in a chorus of besuited actors shouting a monologue as one.

“Everybody’s Live” will continue to have hiccups as it eases into its new schedule, because hiccups are built into the blueprint of a show that solicits live callers and has the host react in real time. (I have some follow-up questions about the Redondo Beach trainer’s high-tech workout.) For all Mulaney’s self-deprecation, though, there’s still a confidence to picking right back up where he left off almost a year ago. Nothing else on TV vibrates at the same frequency as “Everybody’s Live,” née “Everybody’s in LA.” It’s on us to attune ourselves.",indiewire

Roan appeared on a new episode of Today’s Country Radio With Kelleigh Bannen on Apple Music, as previewed by E! News, and reflected on her longtime love of country.

“I really just did it for fun,” Roan said of the new single. “I’m not switching genres or anything. I wanted to write a country song because I just thought it would be funny. It’s campy and fun.”

The singer explained that her connection to country music goes back many years. “I’m from southwest Missouri,” she said. “Grew up on Christian and country, and then found ‘Alejandro’ by Lady Gaga and I was like, ‘I think I like this, too.’ So, I have kept country in my heart. And it’s so incredibly nostalgic to drive in West Hollywood and [play] Jason Aldean or Alan Jackson’s ‘Chattahoochee.’”

She added that Big & Rich’s 2004 track “Save a Horse (Ride a Cowboy)” was a big inspiration on “The Giver.” “I was like, ‘I want to feel that way on stage. I want to feel that,'” she explained. “Because that’s how I write. I’m like, ‘How do I want to walk around on stage and sing?’ And I was like, ‘I want to write that song, but Chappell’s version.’”

Roan initially debuted “The Giver” on Saturday Night Live in November and has since been teasing the song on social media and on billboards around the U.S. The song, written with Dan Nigro, arrives later today.

The musician previously addressed fan concerns that she was leaving her formative pop music in the dust in a post on Instagram. “I have such a special place in my heart for country music,” she wrote. “I grew up listening to it every morning and afternoon on my school bus and had it swirling around me at bon fires, grocery stores and karaoke bars. Many people have asked if this means I’m making a country album??? My answer is.. hmm right now I’m just making songs that make me feel happy and fun and The Giver is my take on cuntry xoxo may the classic country divas lead their genre, I am just here to twirl and do a little gay yodel for yall.”

Roan recently took home the Grammy for Best New Artist following the ultra-massive success of her debut album and its follow-up single “Good Luck, Babe!” She used her acceptance speech to demand that labels offer “a livable wage and healthcare, especially to developing artists.”",indiewire

Cooper, whose podcast is one of the most popular in the world, is producing a new dating format, Overboard for Love (w/t), for Hulu.

It marks Cooper’s first series for her production company Unwell Productions.

The series is set on the high seas. A group of “sexy singles” step board a luxury yacht, ready to mix and mingle and find love. But there’s a twist. Per the logline, gaining access to the yacht’s extravagant amenities won’t be so simple. As the journey unfolds, romance ignites, alliances form and hearts are shattered. In the end, only one couple will reign supreme. Who will rise to the top, and who will be left stranded?

Cooper’s Unwell Productions will produce alongside Jeff Jenkins Productions in association with 3BMG, and Walt Disney Television Alternative.

Watch on Deadline

Exec producers include Cooper, Jenkins, Matt Kaplan, Mina Lefevre, Russell Jay-Staglik, former Bachelor exec producer Jason Ehrlich, Ross Weintraub and Reinout Oerlemans.

Cooper, who has been described as the Barbara Walters for Gen Z, has telegraphed her interest in moving into TV for some time; in 2023, she launched Trending, a media company co-founded with her husband Kaplan, who produced Netflix’s To All The Boys franchise and its series spinoff XO, Kitty. The pair hired former Meta and MTV exec Mina Lefevre as chief content officer of television at the end of 2023.

Cooper, a former D1 soccer player, hosted Olympics coverage over the summer on Peacock. This comes after she signed a lucrative podcasting deal with SiriusXM to take over distribution and advertising for Call Her Daddy.

Overboard for Love also marks the second series for Jenkins at Hulu. Jenkins, who previously exec produced E!’s Keeping Up With The Kardashians, produced The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives for the streamer. The reality show, which featured a group of MomTok influencers, including Taylor Frankie Paul, who went viral for revealing the “soft-swinging” that went on in the group, debuted in 2024 as Hulu’s most-watched unscripted season premiere. It returns on May 15 for its second season.

The series joins Hulu’s unscripted slate, which also includes The Kardashians, Vanderpump Villa and forthcoming competition series Got to Get Out.

“I couldn’t be more excited that Unwell Productions’ first unscripted series, Overboard for Love, is coming to life with our amazing partner, Hulu,” said Alex Cooper. “This project marks a major milestone for us, perfectly reflecting our vision of creating bold, unfiltered content that pushes boundaries. We’ve designed a truly unique dating show, and I can’t wait for viewers to see what Unwell is capable of.”

“I’m incredibly excited to be collaborating with Alex and the team at Unwell Productions on their first television project,” added Rob Mills, EVP, Unscripted and Alternative Entertainment, Walt Disney Television. “Alex is a trailblazer who is undoubtedly shaping the future of entertainment, and this is only the beginning of an exciting journey as we welcome her to the family.”

(Sorry, too soon?)

After deciding that she wanted to pursue a relationship with Robin (complete with Fatima’s unexpected blessing), Andi left the firm in high spirits, finally believing that she’s worthy of love. Unfortunately, her vibes were almost instantly harshed by a masked assailant who kidnapped her in the parking garage.

Meanwhile, Zac and Fatima concluded that they’ve been suspecting all the wrong people in their investigation into Gary’s stabbing. As Fatima rightly pointed out, “Gary’s been a lying psychopath since way before he and Andi started dating.” So Gary high-tailed it to the firm, picking up on Andi’s phone location.

And Team #Zatima was right on the money! Gary was taken down by a team of his longtime haters, led by Hudson — or should we say Oswald Hudson, who still holds a grudge against Gary and his friends for bullying him in high school 18 years ago, as well as for the death of Kimberly Potter.

As for who did the actual deed, Gary was gobsmacked by the return of his ex-wife Jasmine, who took full responsibility for his stabbing with a devious smile on her face. Jasmine then added Andi to the party, recapping all of her grievances — ruining her and Gary’s marriage, blowing up her life, blah, blah, blah.

And we weren’t the only ones who got annoyed by Jasmine’s yammering. Before she could finish laying out her master plan, Hudson shot her in the chest, splattering her all over the walls of Gary’s office.

Then came one final twist: Zac barreled his way into the room, entering into a struggle for the gun with both Hudson and Gary. Multiple shots went off… but who was hit? We’ll find out when Season 9 premieres on July 16 (9/8c).

In non-Andi and Gary news, Tony revealed that he’s being transferred to Alaska as punishment for his and Danni’s office drama, Jordan celebrated his newfound freedom, Sabrina walked in on Penelope and Rich having sex in his juicery, and Robin boarded a flight believing that Andi doesn’t love him.

But the most exciting non-Andi and Gary news came courtesy of Karen, whose water finally broke after what feels like 15 seasons. Naturally, the big moment happened with Fatima by her side. This is going to be good.

https://indiewire.com,College Hoops Prosecutor Defends DOJ Bribery Probe’s Legacy,https://www.sportico.com/leagues/college-sports/2025/college-basketball-fbi-bribery-pitino-1234842571/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 04:01:00 GMT","In late January, Duke men’s basketball eked out a seven-point victory at Wake Forest. Watching from the crowd of 13,169 at LJVM Coliseum in Winston-Salem, N.C., was Robert Boone, a former Division I soccer player at Howard University who now works as a white-collar lawyer for WilmerHale in New York City.

A college sports fan, there was no notable reason for Boone to be at the game—but his presence stood out. Before transitioning to private practice, Boone worked as an assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, where he served as one of the key lawyers behind the federal government’s effort to criminally prosecute NCAA athlete bribery.

Originally hailed as a game-changer seven and a half years ago, the college basketball corruption probe is now widely regarded as a case of prosecutorial overreach that fell short of its hype.

“I totally get the perception that it was going to be something bigger, and it wasn’t,” Boone told Sportico last fall at a Manhattan coffee shop near his office. “And I don’t think that’s necessarily an unfair read.”

In the course of that conversation—and in a follow-up phone interview earlier this month—Boone reflected on the government’s efforts to confront college sports’ underground economy and all the reforms to that economy that have taken place since. While he acknowledges the criticism of those efforts, Boone maintains that the investigation was a necessary first step that, despite its shortcomings, helped spur many of the NCAA reforms that followed.

“Maybe I’m biased,” Boone said, “but I think the involvement of federal authorities was a bigger shock to the system than any previous attempts at reform. Combined with the timing and the growing money in college sports, it was reaching a tipping point that ultimately pushed the issue over the edge.”

This year’s March Madness seems to offer a compelling closing argument for detractors of the Department of Justice operation that carried the high-flown codename “Ballerz.”

Rick Pitino, who was ousted from Louisville amid the scandal, is now the head coach at St. John’s University, where he has led the No. 6-ranked Red Storm to their highest heights in a quarter-century. Auburn’s Bruce Pearl, whose program was also at the center of Ballerz, currently leads a Tigers program ranked No. 3 in the nation. Alabama, which was implicated in the investigation, is currently No. 5. And Creighton and Arizona, while currently unranked, are well-positioned to make the NCAA men’s basketball tourney with at-large bids.

Beyond specific schools and individuals, the entire landscape of college sports has been turned on its head. Players can now hire agents and get paid for their NIL—wink, wink—and, come next academic year, many Division I college basketball players are expected to receive revenue-sharing payments directly from their schools.

The 10 individuals initially arrested in September 2017, which included four college assistant coaches, were all relative bit players in the ecosystem. Although the feds suggested there was more to come, no others were ever charged. That’s if you’re not including one of the FBI’s lead case agents in the probe, who would later plead guilty to gambling away thousands of dollars of the government’s money that was supposed to be used for a “Ballerz”-related sting.

From the outset, prosecutors faced skepticism from the public and media, who questioned why law enforcement appeared to be taking on the role of the NCAA’s enforcement arm.

“Normally, when these cases and the evidence are announced, [prosecutors] get the benefit of the doubt from the media, for better or for worse,” Boone said.

He laments that the distinction between two separate alleged fraud schemes—one involving charges against individuals who bribed players to attend specific schools, and the other concerning bribes paid to coaches to direct players toward certain agents—was blurred into a single pay-to-play conspiracy in the public’s eye.

Boone attributes this confusion to media coverage and the legal tactics employed by the defense attorneys. Yet the government itself framed it as a unified web of corruption when it first announced the indictments over 7 1/2 years ago.

“The picture painted by these charges is anything but pretty,” Joon Kim, the acting U.S. Attorney, said at the time. “Coaches at some of the sport’s most prestigious programs soliciting and accepting cash bribes. Managers and financial advisors preying on top-tier prospects like vultures. And employees from one of the largest sportswear companies secretly funneling money to high school recruits.”

To Kim’s right, two easels displayed posters illustrating the flow of money in the alleged bribery and fraud schemes. Beside them was Boone, the former Howard soccer player, standing sentinel along with the other assistant U.S. attorneys handling the cases.

The press conference took place during the first week of official practice for the 2017-18 college basketball season—one year after the Supreme Court upheld the ruling in O’Bannon v. NCAA and two years before California passed its groundbreaking NIL law. Watching the event today feels like tuning into Turner Classic Movies– or cracking open a sedimentary rock. The under-the-table payments at the center of the case, which involved sums of up to $100,000, now seem trivial in comparison to the rapidly escalating figures involved in today’s NIL economy. And the government’s portrayal of the situation was quaint, if not fanciful.

“We hope these charges and arrests serve to keep the sport they love clean and honest,” said Kim, who then turned it over to Bill Sweeney Jr., the assistant director of the FBI’s New York Field Office.

“All of those charged today played a role in creating a pay-to-play culture that has no place in college basketball,” Sweeney said, before delivering his infamous punchline. “Today’s arrests should serve as a warning to anyone considering this kind of business in college athletics: we have your playbook.”

The probe came to be known in the media as the FBI’s college basketball investigation, but as Boone points out, the Bureau was relatively late to the scene. In fact, the work began as part of a securities fraud case involving Louis Martin “Marty” Blazer, a financial advisor accused of embezzling millions from his clients, including several former pro athletes. In a bid to reduce his charges, Blazer told SEC investigators that he had knowledge of widespread bribery in college athletics, and offered to help expose it. The SEC passed the information along to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, who assigned the matter to its public corruption unit.

Boone, who joined the Southern District of New York (SDNY) in 2012, had been on the public corruption beat for approximately a year when he was assigned the task of debriefing Blazer over college sports. From the outset, he said he approached the situation with tempered expectations.

“It was more like, ‘Hey, let’s just talk to the guy and sort of check the box to see if there’s anything there,’” Boone said. And initially, it didn’t seem like there was.

For the first six months of the investigation, it was just Boone and an in-house SDNY staffer conducting interviews of Blazer every few weeks, typically in Boone’s office. Those early conversations focused on bribes Blazer purportedly knew about involving college football coaches and recruits.

“There were many times where we almost ended it,” Boone said. “I remember at one point the SEC wanted to go forward with their case, because they had basically been waiting for us to see if we could get any use out of his proactive cooperation before bringing (securities) charges. It was just taking a while, and it was unclear if we were going to be able to do anything on the sports stuff.”

Nevertheless, Boone continued to engage with Blazer, which ultimately led to his learning about Blazer’s connections to Christian Dawkins, a former AAU basketball coach and talent recruiter for ASM Sports. By then, Dawkins was attempting to launch his own athlete representation business, but he was struggling to find financial backers after being sued by another former employer, International Management Advisors, for allegedly stealing clients and misappropriating the company credit card after he left. Blazer, acting as a cooperating witness, agreed to help Dawkins.

“We got a little bit fortunate in that Christian Dawkins had his own issues at the time that put him in a more desperate position for financial help, and so that kept the conversation going,” Boone said.

On Sep. 15, 2017, nine days before “Ballerz” was made public, Boone represented the government in the court hearing in which Blazer pled guilty to securities fraud. As part of his cooperation agreement, Blazer admitted to having given cash payments to college athletes between 2000 and 2013 to induce them to hire him as their financial advisor when they turned pro.

Persons eventually plead guilty in March 2019 to accepting $91,500 in bribes in exchange for directing Auburn players to Blazer. Dawkins, along with former Adidas reps James Gatto and Merl Code, were convicted by a jury in October 2018 of defrauding three Adidas-sponsored universities—Louisville, Kansas and North Carolina State—by funneling illicit payments to their recruits or their families as inducements to sign with the schools. The athletes included Brian Bowen (Louisville), Billy Preston (Kansas) and Dennis Smith Jr. (NC State).

Boone was not involved in those proceedings, but did lead the two-and-a-half-week trial in May 2019 that earned Dawkins his second conviction for paying bribes to college coaches to steer their players to his upstart agency.

Over the years, Dawkins has suggested, including in interviews last year with Sportico, that the feds had their sights set on Pitino from early on and that Dawkins turned down a plea offer tendered by FBI agents upon his arrest to help make a case against the legendary coach. Pitino, who was never charged, has maintained that he never knew about any bribes taking place, was terminated by Louisville less than a month after charges were announced. He later conceded he “deserved” to be fired, given his leadership role with the Cardinals.

“I don’t think it was accurate to say Pitino was the focus,” Boone told Sportico, though he added: “You always want to get who you think is most responsible for directing the misconduct.”

Throughout the prosecution, Boone emphasized that he and his team remained “very conscious” of the public debate surrounding college athlete compensation.

“That issue was clearly top of mind from the start,” Boone said. “We consciously were not interested in trying to criminalize the mere payment of money going to a player, in and of itself.”

In the end, the government won convictions of nine of the 10 individuals it arrested, five of whom served time in prison. Dawkins had the longest sentence behind bars.

Blazer, who never served jail time, died of natural causes in January 2024 at the age of 53.

As a direct offshoot of “Ballerz,” Boone would go on to successfully prosecute Michael Avenatti, the former attorney for Stormy Daniels, for attempting to extort Nike. According to the government, Avenatti had threatened to publicize allegations about the shoe company making illicit payments to top college basketball recruits. A former SDNY prosecutor, who was representing Nike at the time, tipped off the U.S. Attorney’s Office to the scheme. Avenatti was found guilty in February 2020, the first of several convictions he received in separate, unrelated cases.

After spending 9 1/2 years at the SDNY, Boone left in October 2021 for his current position at WilmerHale. He occasionally runs into his former boss, Joon Kim, who now works six blocks away as a partner at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton. When they cross paths, Boone says, the topic of “Ballerz” tends to come up—and fondly so. (Kim did not respond to an interview request.)

Boone takes comfort in the belief that the prosecutions contributed to desperately needed reform in college athletics.

“I think it helped push the conversation forward,” Boone said. “If the goal is to shine a light on areas of corruption—or areas vulnerable to it—and get people thinking about why that is, whether it should be, and if there’s a way to change it, then I’d like to think I played a part. How change happens is up to those in the space, but I think it was a piece of the puzzle.”",indiewire

Taylor Hasselhoff-Fiore, 34, shared a touching tribute to her mom — who died by suicide on March 5 at age 62 — via her Instagram Story on Wednesday, March 12.

Taylor shared a series of photos of Pamela, including childhood photos of her and Pamela, as well as David and her younger sister, Hayley, 32, and set it to the song “Pure Imagination,” performed by Timothée Chalamet in the hit movie Wonka.

“I’d do anything in the world to hug you again, my forever angel,” Taylor wrote over the post.

“You are my best friend, my whole heart, my everything,” Taylor continued. “I promise to make you proud & celebrate you every day. [Taylor’s daughter] London will know how incredible you are & I promise I will protect Hayley forever.”

Taylor concluded, “Mama, I love you so much … the pain is unbearable but I will be strong for you & hold onto your memory until we meet again, my beautiful.”

After David and Pamela met on the set of Knight Rider when she was a guest star, the pair tied the knot in 1989 before splitting in 2006.

After their divorce was finalized, Pamela told The Associated Press, “I’ve always loved him and always will, and have love and compassion for him. It’s a very, very sad day, but a day to move on.”

“Yes, I have two children now. One was controversial, one you all seem to be cool with,” Mulaney, 42, joked during the premiere of Everybody’s Live With John Mulaney on Wednesday, March 12. “So, thank you so much for that. I did want to say something: Over the past few months, many people have reached out in a very nice way about my wife Olivia who’s been battling breast cancer. I really appreciate all the nice messages that obviously she has received and that even I have received.”

The comedian continued: “But it’s been a real thing to be with someone you love so much going through this. In the past couple years, Olivia has had five surgeries, months and months of cancer treatment, and the fight that she’s put up has made her so inspiring. And the effect of cancer treatment on her brain has made her, at times, so dumb.”

As Mulaney explained, “There’s a thing called cancer brain: not brain cancer. Cancer brain. It’s a sweet, wonderful dumbness that happens after all that challenging treatment. I’ll give you an example. We went to a fertility doctor, we were going to make embryos. This was after Olivia had a double mastectomy, but before her hysterectomy and ovariectomy. We were going to make embryos for what eventually became our daughter this fall.”

He recalled that he and Munn, 44, “were standing in the doctor’s office and this conversation happened word for word. Doctor: ‘The great news is nine eggs survived the thaw.’ Olivia: ‘So now, we uh, combine it with his, uh, cum?’”

At the time, Mulaney corrected Munn, saying, “Baby, baby. It’s semen,” while the doctor stated: “Guys, it’s sperm.”

Munn revealed in March 2024 that she had been diagnosed with cancer one year earlier.

“I took out my uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries,” she told Vogue in May 2024. “Doing a full hysterectomy was a big decision to make, but it was the best decision for me because I needed to be present for my family.”

During the Thursday, March 13, episode of The Kardashians, Kim, 44, reflected on each ring she received from her three respective marriages.

“Khloé [Kardashian], should I just start wearing my diamonds again? I wonder what my next ring shape will be — of my last and final hoorah,” Kim quipped. “The first one [from Damon Thomas] was a cushion cut that was 14 carats.”

Kim married Thomas, now 54, when she was 19 and they divorced before her debut on Keeping Up With the Kardashians in 2007. The duo, who had a 10-year age difference, were married for three years until they called it quits in 2003.

“The second I had to give Kris [Humphries] and it was 18 carats,” she continued on Thursday. “I didn’t keep it. I was pregnant with North, still married to him and in order to divorce him, he said I had to give him the ring in the divorce. The ring that I bought. He contributed a fifth [of the cost].”

Kim got engaged to Humphries, now 40, in 2011 following a whirlwind romance. Kim and Humphries tied the knot in 2011 but split after 72 days of marriage. Their divorce was finalized in April 2013 following a lengthy court battle.

“That whole situation was just really hard for me,” Kim said of her relationship with Humphries during an appearance on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen in 2017. “At the time I just thought, ‘Holy s—, I’m 30 years old, I better get this together. I better get married.’ I think a lot of girls do go through that, where they freak out thinking they’re getting old and all their friends are having kids. So, it was more of that situation. But I knew on the honeymoon it wasn’t going to work out.”

Kim moved on with Kanye West and the pair welcomed daughter North before getting married in 2014. They later expanded their family with son Saint in 2015, daughter Chicago in 2018 and son Psalm in 2019. In February 2021, Kim filed for divorce after nearly seven years of marriage. Their divorce was finalized in November 2022.

Are you looking to get robbed?'”

Kim noted that her plan was to give North her engagement ring from West, 47. Kim previously opened up about how she wasn’t ruling out another marriage. (The reality star was linked to Pete Davidson and Odell Beckham Jr. after her third divorce.)

“I think I am definitely going to be really cautious because I maybe have proven that I am not the best at [marriage]. And I don’t want to make that mistake again,” Kim said during the June 2022 episode of Today With Hoda & Jenna. “Sometimes I think, ‘Should I just be in one of those relationships like Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell [who are together but not married]?’ It seems to be working out for them.”

“I thought it was going to be like the marketplace,” Kim said in a confessional. “This is like the streets.”

She continued: “What you see Aladdin going through and stealing the bread from. That is where I thought we were going.”

Kim and Khloé were able to make the most of their walk by buying some gifts for their family. They had to step into a jewelry store after getting caught in some rain, since July is usually “monsoon season” in India. At the store, Kim and Khloé purchased silver pill boxes “to put by” their beds for everyone in the family.

In a post-credits scene, Kim elaborated on her love for Disney movies, adding, “I just feel like Princess Jasmine. This is where I am meant to be.”

Elsewhere in the episode, Kourtney Kardashian took part in the Run Travis Run 5K in support of husband Travis Barker. While Barker, 49, ran most of the way, Kourtney, 45, opted to speed walk instead.

Klebba, who voices Grumpy in the live-action adaptation of the animated classic, told TMZ on Wednesday, March 12, that “he’s seriously bummed and a bit pissed Disney axed what should’ve been a massive premiere for such a major film.”

While the Snow White premiere will take place on Saturday, March 15, at Los Angeles’ El Capitan Theatre, it won’t be a typical red-carpet event. As Variety reported Tuesday, the press won’t be present for interviews with stars Gal Gadot and Rachel Zegler, the film’s leading ladies, and the event will instead be limited to photographers and house crew. (Us Weekly has reached out to Disney for comment.)

Zegler, 23, plays the titular princess in the film, and Gadot, 39, portrays the Evil Queen. Klebba, meanwhile, is among the actors lending their voices to motion-captured versions of the Seven Dwarves, taking on the role of Grumpy. (Klebba, 55, has a form of dwarfism called acromicric dysplasia.)

Related: Why Are People Mad About 'Snow White'? The Controversy Explained Walt Disney Studios/Courtesy Everett Collection After the success of 2023’s The Little Mermaid, Disney’s next live-action project is a remake of Snow White — but not everyone is excited about the new movie. A live-action version of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has been in development since at least 2016, but production didn’t kick […]

Reasons for the scaled-back premiere have not been confirmed, but the latest Snow White iteration has generated various controversies since the production began four years ago. In a January 2022 interview on Marc Maron‘s “WTF” podcast, actor Peter Dinklage, who has a form of dwarfism known as achondroplasia, opined: “You’re progressive in one way and you’re still making that f—ing backward story about seven dwarves living in a cave together. What the f— are you doing, man?”

After Dinklage’s feedback, Disney released a statement saying, “To avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film, we are taking a different approach with these seven characters and have been consulting with members of the dwarfism community.”

According to TMZ, Klebba claimed that “as far as he knows, motion-capture was always the plan and was not a knee-jerk reaction” to Dinklage’s comments.

The outlet reported, however, that Klebba noted how “it’s unbelievably difficult for Little People to land Hollywood roles, let alone lead ones, so this could have been a bigger opportunity for others.”

She’s not going to be dreaming about true love. She’s dreaming about becoming the leader she knows she can be.”

During an interview for the March 2025 issue of Vogue Mexico, Zegler addressed the public’s response to the reinterpretation of Snow White. “I interpret people’s sentiments towards this film as passion,” she said, per translations. “What an honor to be a part of something that people feel so passionately about.

“We’re doing the movie and, you know, Eminem is just such a brilliant dude,” Mackie, 46, recalled during the Tuesday, March 11, episode of “The Pivot” podcast. “We’re on set one day and he’s like, ‘Yo, it don’t make sense that we beefing.’ And I was like, ‘Right?’ And he’s like, ‘I need something on you.’”

Mackie portrayed Papa Doc in the 2002 drama, the leader of the Free World rap group who ultimately loses to Eminem’s B-Rabbit in an epic final rap showdown. During B-Rabbit’s verses, he claims Papa Doc’s real name is Clarence, he went to a private school and that his parents are still married. According to Mackie, some of the shots were toward him personally, and had “nothing to do” with his character.

“So we talk for, like, two hours, chilling. I go to the casino. The next day, we’re shooting the battle scene, and that’s why I’m standing there like, ‘You’re talking about me. You’re not talking about Clarence!” Mackie recalled, adding that his character’s frustrated facial expressions were his natural reaction to Eminem’s lyrics.

“You’re an a——, Eminem!” he joked. “I’m like, ‘I’m gonna fight this mother f———!’ I’m like, ‘Yes my parents are still married!’”

8 Mile marked both Mackie and Eminem’s feature film debuts. The Marvel star previously opened up about shooting the movie during a 2021 episode of The Rich Eisen Show, claiming that Eminem originally promised his raps would only include “character stuff.”

“There was this one day, we were sitting on the set and Eminem comes over and he’s like ‘What’s up man, I was reading a script and there is no reason for me not to like you, you are cool dude, I like you,’” Mackie recalled. “And then I said, ‘I like you too,’ and then he was like, ‘Cool, so you don’t mind if I add some stuff in the script about you?’ I was like, ‘About me or the character?’ He’s like ‘No, no just some character stuff’. I’m like, ‘Yeah no problem.’”

The actor claimed, “So before the entire 8 Mile final battle, he googles me and learns about me and all that stuff he basically makes fun of me as Papa Doc.”. And then I’m like, ‘That’s a little personal Mr. Marshall. … I grew up in a nice house, my parents were nice to me, why are you making fun of me?’”

“The idea of approaching a rapper from the perspective of an actor, you’re really just speaking in poems. I always said, one of the greatest rappers [who] ever lived was Shakespeare,” Mackie said during a 2021 episode of Hot Ones. “If I didn’t have my training, I wouldn’t be able to play Tupac, Martin Luther King, Papa Doc, Falcon.

During Summer House season 9, episode 3, which aired on February 26, Paige revealed that she was thinking about freezing her eggs, noting that then-boyfriend Craig had already frozen his sperm. (While Summer House filmed in July-August 2024, Paige broke up with Craig that November after three years of dating.)

“I said to him, ‘I should probably freeze my eggs.’ And he goes, ‘Oh should I freeze my sperm?’” she recalled, adding that when Craig got tested, he was “perfectly fine.” She teased, “If anything, [he was] above average.”

Paige’s remarks about having a possible family with Craig aren’t the only comments that have Us doing a double take watching this season unfold.

That’s the fun stuff for me now,” Craig told Austen Kroll during season 10, episode 4, which aired in […]

Scroll down to see which of Paige and Craig’s quotes from season 9 of Summer House haven’t gotten better with age:

Italian Memories

During the season 9 premiere, which aired on February 12, Paige recounted her recent trip to Italy with Craig and her family. “It was so nice. Craig came, like, four or five days in,” she told Ciara Miller, teasing, “Me and my brother just ganged up on Craig the whole time. Every time he talked, we’d be like, ‘Shut up Craig!’”

Getting the Pregnancy Scares

Paige got real about eventual road to motherhood during the season premiere after castmate Lindsay Hubbard revealed her pregnancy. (Lindsay welcomed her first baby, daughter Gemma, in December 2024.)

“I think in my very younger years I had very rose-colored glasses on of like, ‘And then you get a job and you get married and you have a baby,’” Paige told the cameras. “I also used to go in a tanning. You grow up and you learn things.”

She confessed, “Craig is ready to get married and have a baby and I’m still … not.”

Feeling ‘Bad’ for Craig

In a moment that actually makes more sense knowing that they pulled the plug on their romance, Paige gave fans a little insight into her long-distance relationship with Craig during the February 19 episode. After the pair went back and forth over FaceTime about their schedules — and inability to fly to each other’s homes — Paige explained their dynamic was no longer the same.

“Mark the day, ‘cause I’m gonna say it,” Paige said during a confessional. “I feel a little bad for Craig because I am a completely different person than the girl he started dating three years ago.”

Bravo released a preview of what’s to come this season on Summer House after the season 9 premiere aired on Wednesday, February 12. Most of the premiere focused on meeting […]

She noted, “I’m busier. I’m not around as much. I’ve changed my mind [on] a lot of things.” Paige pointed to “marriage and moving and a baby” as things she’s flip-flopped on since she and Craig started dating.

“I’m not going to apologize that my life got busier and that I think differently on certain topics,” Paige continued. “But also, I am trying to recognize that I changed a lot.”

Not Ready for Kids

During season 9, episode 2, Paige shared that Lindsay’s pregnancy was “giving me anxiety” about her own relationship. “Let’s just put it in perspective. Craig and I started dating then Lindsay and Carl [Radke] started dating,” she recalled. “Then they got engaged. Then they planned a wedding. Then they called off a wedding.”

Paige continued: “Then [Lindsay] got a new boyfriend. Then she got pregnant and I’m still dating Craig. So, I’m feeling stressed that I have to have a baby, and I don’t want to do it.”

No More Bed Rotting

“Craig’s been ready for a family and for me to move into his home since literally the day he texted me,” Paige revealed during the February 26 episode. “But I have worked for this exact moment in my career for 10 plus years.”

She reflected on her past goals, saying, “Trust me, I wanted to be in the bed. I wanted to be taken care of. I would’ve loved to have just married a man and said, ‘And now I’m done,’ but that’s not where I’m at.”

Doing a ‘Health Check’

When Craig went to New York during season 9, episode 5, he and Paige had a serious discussion about their future while eating at an Australian restaurant. After Paige revealed she’s so busy she “can’t even find two weeks to freeze my eggs,” Craig confessed it’s a “bummer” that they are always on the go — and nowhere near each other.

“I think we’re so busy sometimes it feels like we live a single life,” Craig explained, noting, “I don’t want us doing events apart forever.” He expressed concerns for the future, adding, “I want to make sure as we continue to get busier … that we continue to make each other and our relationship a priority and we don’t let it slip. We never let our relationship fall to the wayside.”

Craig insisted that he wasn’t upset about their current dynamic, but said the chat was “more of like a health check in the relationship” so it didn’t start to unravel.

“Is there a tinge of you being not happy?” Paige asked. Craig claimed he was happy, but pointed out, “We are five times busier now than we were when we started dating.”

More Money, Less Paige

During the same March 12 episode, Craig alleged that it was “awesome” that Paige was becoming “more successful and busier,” which prompted Paige to ask, “Is it?”

When Craig questioned whether Paige thought he was truly happy for her success, she confessed that she wasn’t expecting her career trajectory either.

“My career took a different turn, and I can’t travel as much as I used to,” Paige explained, telling her then-partner, “I don’t want you to ever feel neglected. I don’t want you to ever feel like you’re not a priority. You’re absolutely a priority.”

She noted that Craig needed to be “a little bit OK” that they were going to be spending more time apart that year because of her job commitments.

Who Is Summer Houses’ No. 1 Guy in the Group?

“I was just being honest, if you were this busy for the rest of our lives, I wouldn’t see it working out,” Craig replied. He acknowledged that Paige would choose work “10 times out of 10” now, but added that when they had kids, she wouldn’t be able to “choose work all the time.”

Paige admitted Craig’s way of thinking made her feel like “if I get more and more successful it’s a bad thing” and that if she didn’t make him her “No. 1 priority, I’m going to feel guilty.”

Craig tried to ease the tension, claiming that he didn’t want her to “slow down,” but Paige pointed out that Craig was ready for babies “tomorrow” and the white picket fence existence.

“I don’t ever want to live a slow life,” she confessed. Craig confirmed that he did want the dad and hanging in the backyard lifestyle “one day,” adding, “I just never thought I’d be in such a submissive, like, relationship.”

Paige quipped, “Should I apologize for being strong and independent?” to which Craig replied, “I didn’t realize I would be giving up so much decision making.”

“For the past three — almost three years, I have been living in my car,” Robinson, 58, said in a YouTube video uploaded on Tuesday, March 11. “I said it. Oh my God.”

Robinson explained that in 2020 she was living with her parents in Las Vegas. She claimed that after experiencing some tension with her mother, she decided to leave the home.

“I can’t deal with this. I respect her too much. I didn’t understand it. I still don’t and it hurt me,” she reflected on her decision to leave her parents’ house. “I was just trying to figure it out but I couldn’t … you can’t read someone else’s mind and you can’t figure them out.”

I was homeless for about three months, way in the beginning before Baywatch,” D’Errico, 56, exclusively told Us Weekly while attending the Los Angeles Mission’s annual Christmas celebration. During the […]

When Robinson moved out, she was sleeping in her car for “about a month in Vegas.” Robinson’s manager at the time encouraged her to come back to Los Angeles where he lived. As the temperatures in Las Vegas started to increase, she decided to go back since she “loved” living in Los Angeles.

Robinson then claimed that her former manager offered to let Robinson stay with him until she got back on her feet. However, both he and Robinson had dogs and there wasn’t enough space in his place for two people and two canines. As a result, the manager volunteered to get her a hotel where she ended up staying for “eight months”

While Robinson looked for a place to live, she said the manager offered to help her and attend listings with her — but didn’t follow through. When she asked him for his thoughts, she said he allegedly found something wrong with each housing option.

“I’m trying to make this easier on you because financially I know it’s got to be hard,” she said she told her former manager in the video. “You’re paying rent and you’re paying my hotel.”

After finding no success on the home front, Robinson said she decided to research car life and was impressed with the lifestyle.

“There’s a whole community of people who live in their cars and a whole community of people who live in their RVs and a whole community of people who live in their vans,” she reflected. “And I loved what I was seeing. I just thought, ‘Wow, these people. I could do this, I think.’”

Robinson left the hotel for good in 2022 and took her car up to Malibu. While she said she found the first night to be “scary,” Robinson had no regrets about her decision and she ended up getting comfortable as she learned the ins and outs of car life, including how to cover her windows and being selective of the information she shared with others around her.

“I felt free,” she shared. “That was a sense of freedom that I had. I was so free.”

Robinson claimed that many people encouraged her not to be so candid about her current living situation, fearing it would lead to public judgment. For Robinson, she said she wasn’t worried about others’ perception of her lifestyle.

“Nobody has stepped or walked five steps in my stilettos,” she said. “It’s real and it’s OK. Part of being human is to be vulnerable.”

Instead, she opted to be honest, hoping to inspire others.

“My aim is to inspire and let people know that you’re capable of anything no matter what the odds are against you,” she said.

Robinson was an on-and-off member of the girl group En Vogue. She joined the band when they formed in 1989. Robinson first exited En Vogue in 1997. In 2002, she returned before leaving again in 2008 for a solo music career.",usmagazine

On the Wednesday, March 12, episode of her and Teddi Mellencamp’s “iHeartRadio’s Two Ts In A Pod” podcast, Judge, 57, elaborated during a chat with Dolores Catania regarding her recent claims that she quit RHOC while filming season 19.

“I think I just hit a wall. There’s so much going on in my life and it’s just I don’t know,’ Judge reflected while admitting that’s she’s been going to therapy as she is struggling with some “personal things.”

She continued: “I just just hit a wall and I feel like I’m gonna be in a full depressed mode.”

Related: ‘Real Housewives’ Cast Members Who Have Quit While Filming the Show On Sunday, March 9, Real Housewives of Orange County star Tamra Judge appeared to suggest she’s done with the show — and she’s not the only cast member who has unexpectedly quit mid-season. “It was a long run! When life gives you real problems this reality s— doesn’t make sense. Peace out … I’m out,” […]

Judge explained that this year has not been off to a good start for her recently and she can’t get out of the funk she’s been in despite seeking professional help.

“I’m just so mad at myself because I feel like I just can’t pull myself out of the funk. Well, I’m usually pretty good of just pulling myself out, and I’ve been saying it for a while now,” she said. “I just can’t pull myself out of this. I

can’t pull myself out of this. And it was just 2025 has been a real doozy. It’s just been one thing after another.”

Judge shared that she went into filming this season of RHOC amid her personal struggles. However, it all got to be too much for her.

“I went into the season not knowing, not sure, very anxious and just dealing with some stuff through therapy, and

you know that really breaks you down to your lowest point,” she admitted. “I’m like, ‘Should I just quit?

Because it’s just I feel like it’s breaking me down.'”

Judge added that Mellencamp’s health issues have also taken a heavy toll on her. However, her podcast cohost has still been by her side through this rough patch.

“Teddi gave me a pep talk and that is like the first time I’ve laughed in so long. Like, we laughed, and she just yelled at me and said, ‘Listen to me, I have to be bald and fat right now and going through this. You get your ass back over there,'” she recalled. “I just started laughing. So I think I’m going to see her today. I think that’s gonna pull little bit of spark back into me.”

Catania then addressed the speculation that Judge had exited RHOC, telling Judge, “The word on the street is you just need a little break.”

Judge, for her part, agreed that was the case.

“Yeah. When I get like this, my body just shuts down, It just completely shuts down,” she said. “And I can

just sit in one place and just stare at the wall for hours. And that’s how I feel and it’s really hard to film like that when you feel like that.”

Earlier this week, Judge sent fans into a frenzy when she hinted at her exit from the Bravo reality show.

“It was a long run! When life gives you real problems this reality s— doesn’t make sense,” she wrote via her Instagram Story on Sunday, March 9. “Peace out … I’m out.”

Judge then shared an Instagram Story selfie on Monday, March 10, alongside the caption, “Mental health is health.”

Following Judge’s cryptic messages, she weighed in on the comments section of a fan account speculating about the details of her apparent departure.

“#TamraJudge just posted this?? The cast is currently in New Orleans on their cast trip. 🎥🍊 Is Tamra quitting??” the Instagram account wrote, referring to a screenshot of Judge’s Instagram Story. Judge subsequently reacted, appearing to confirm the theory of her exit by commenting, “Yes!!!”

The fan account then replied to Judge’s comment, asking, “Tamra what’s going on??” while other viewers begged her to stay on the show.

Although Bravo has yet to announce the season 19 cast, Gretchen Rossi was previously confirmed to return as a “friend,” and Judge was recently spotted filming in New Orleans with Shannon Beador, Heather Dubrow, Katie Ginella, Gina Kirschenheiter, Jennifer Pedranti and Emily Simpson.

Amid the drama, Andy Cohen remained tight-lipped about Judge’s future on RHOC.

“I got the report of what happened last night,” Cohen, 56, said during the Monday episode of SiriusXM’s Radio Andy. “All I will say is this. I can’t comment on what’s going on while we’re filming shows.”

Judge has been a cast member on RHOC since season 3 in 2007. She briefly left the show after season 14 in 2019 but later returned as a full-time Housewife in season 17, which premiered in 2023.

The RHOC ordeal comes as Judge supports her friend and podcast cohost, Mellencamp, 43, following her recent surgery to remove multiple brain tumors. Judge asserted during the February 19 episode of their podcast that it was “not my place” to offer updates on Mellencamp’s health and grew emotional when she said, “All I can do is pray on her and love her like all of her friends are doing.”",usmagazine

“They are spending time together in [New York City] and it’s very new,” the insider shares, adding that Jowsey, 27, “initiated things” with Hale, 35, after sending her a DM on Instagram.

The source notes that the pair’s mutual sobriety is what caused them to initially “hit it off.” The Pretty Little Liars alum, the insider says, has been “very supportive toward” Jowsey and “his decision” to cut out alcohol.

“It’s casual and they are having fun, but Harry is very into Lucy,” the source continues. “Friends around them think they are very cute and are a good, yet surprising match.”

I was very scared.” Hale had her first […]

Hale first opened up about her efforts to get sober in February 2023, when she revealed via Instagram that she was celebrating one year of sobriety. She opened up about the journey further while on an episode of “The Diary of a CEO” podcast later that month.

“I have been working on getting sober since I was 20. I’m 33. It takes time. It took time. It took patience with myself,” she shared, admitting she thought the “real Lucy” came out when she drank which eventually became “exhausting.”

While speaking to People in September 2023, Hale, who was 32 at the time and first began drinking at the age of 18, recalled her “rock bottom” moment with alcohol, claiming that she would have “lost everything” she “cared about” had she continued on “the path” of alcohol dependency.

“It was the scariest choice in my life, but also it’s been the best gift,” she explained. “When I made that change, everything else changed. My whole life has changed.”

She continued, “I definitely had to go through my own process of getting sober. took many, many, many years, many relapses, many dark moments, many falling on my face quite literally, but figuratively as well, to figure out what was working in my life, finding out why I was drinking, because removing alcohol is just one part of it.”

In January, Hale revealed that she is officially three years sober.

“Since then, I’ve experienced moments that can only be described as pure miracles and magic. I am deeply grateful every day — for the people who have been guiding lights, for a power greater than myself that loves me unconditionally, and for my own perseverance in not giving up,” she wrote via Instagram to mark the major milestone. “To all of you who have supported my journey, I have felt your love and it means everything to me.”

Jowsey, for his part, first opened up about his desire to get sober in 2022. He told Newsweek at the time that he wanted to “realign my goals and focus on the man that I want to be in five years” after realizing that alcohol had become a reward system.

Brown, 21, who is on a press tour for her forthcoming film The Electric State, walked the red carpet for a fan screening at The Paris Theatre in New York on Tuesday, March 11. Afterward, she slipped into a sheer black lace vintage dress from the ’90s (that her stylist Ryan Young unearthed from a consignment shop in London) for an evening with her husband Jake Bongiovi, who is the son of musician Jon Bon Jovi.

Brown’s outfit was just the latest in a long line of ’90s-influenced looks. Indeed, she’s recently taken to wearing only archival designs from the decade during which her new movie takes place.

Featuring a faux fur neckline and cuffs, Brown’s frock flashed her panties, which recalled Kate Moss’ legendary transparent slip, who similarly wore hers with black underwear while at a party in 1993.Brown, however, elevated the ensemble not with rubber flip-flops à la Moss, 51, but black satin pumps with crystal-covered stiletto heels by Louis Vuitton.

Eagle-eyed fashion fans may recall that the supermodel also wore a near-identical black lace gown on her 50th birthday, which suggested that Brown may have been doubling down on the the everlasting appeal of the naked dress.

This isn’t the first time Brown has bared (almost) all. Last month in Madrid, she graced the crimson rug in a sheer blue Giorgio Armani gown (the exact one Gwyneth Paltrow wore to the 1998 premiere of her movie Shakespeare in Love — six years before Brown was born).

As Brown revealed on a March 11 episode of “The Movie Podcast,” Paltrow, 52, sent over a rack of ’90s-era clothes for her to wear during the ongoing press tour. Pamela Anderson also mailed the actress a “huge bag” of pre-loved pieces, which Brown was spotted in as of late.

“I’ve been a huge fan of ’90s style aesthetic, hair, makeup,” the Stranger Things actress said on the podcast. “I wasn’t as well versed in it before The Electric State, so [it] opened up those ideas.” Brown continued: “I was really able to indulge in these ’90s icons and actually pull some looks from those icons’ closets, so we have been able to build out this amazing journey of what the press tour could look like.”

The couple started working together on Amazon Prime’s The Boys. Quaid has played tech genius Hughie Campbell since the show’s premiere in 2019, while Doumit began appearing as Victoria Neuman, a politician turned supervillain, in 2020.

Two years after Doumit joined The Boys, she and Quaid seemingly confirmed their romance when they were spotted holding hands in Australia while promoting season 3 of their show.

In July 2023, a source told Us Weekly that Quaid and Doumit were “still together and going strong.”

While the duo have chosen to keep their relationship very private, they made their red carpet debut at the 2024 Oscars and Doumit supported Quaid at the premiere of his film Novocaine in March 2025.

“We offered Jake Paul the fight probably 10 or 20 times and he turned us down,” said Mayweather, who spoke exclusively to Us Weekly while promoting his 101 (ONE OF ONE) line of premium natural supplements. “So that’s bulls—.”

Rumors about a boxing match between Mayweather, 48, and Paul, 28, have circulated for years. The speculation picked up further steam during Mayweather’s appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon last month, when the undefeated boxer said a fight against Paul would be “easy.”

Days later, Paul released a YouTube vlog alleging Mayweather “wouldn’t sign” their fight contract, but Mayweather insists that it’s actually been Paul who has refused to put ink on the dotted line.

Thomas, 20, was front and center at the Friday, November 15 boxing match, which certainly got the attention of the hordes of viewers watching at home. In an exclusive interview […]

When asked about the claim that Mayweather and his team wanted Paul to cut weight down to 160, which Paul called “physically impossible,” Mayweather had a solution for that.

“Well, we can do an exhibition,” he offered to Us. “We know we can’t do a real fight because it’s not going to be sanctioned because of the weight difference. But we could do an exhibition. That’s easy work, super easy.”

Mayweather previously fought Paul’s older brother, Logan Paul, in an exhibition boxing match in 2021. The non-scored bout went all eight rounds and no winner was announced.

Jake, meanwhile, last entered the ring against legendary boxer Mike Tyson, a fight that streamed live on Netflix in November 2024. Jake ultimately defeated Tyson, 58, by unanimous decision — but Mayweather was less than impressed.

“Mike Tyson was a 60-year-old man,” Mayweather told Us. “He’s an old man. Mike Tyson is enjoying his life. It is what it is.”

Despite his beef with some of the Paul brothers’ gamesmanship and tactics, Mayweather credited them for their work ethic.

“One thing about Jake Paul and Logan Paul, we can’t knock their hustle,” Mayweather said. “I take my hat off. I like how they hustle.”

On the topic of hustling, Mayweather recently unveiled his 101 (ONE OF ONE) line of products, which includes whey protein powder, pre-workout, hydration stick packs and more.

“You always want to be better each time you go out and perform,” Mayweather explained. “You always want to be better each and every day. Our supplements give you everything you need. The greens, the proteins, the boost, the rehydration.”

Mayweather added, “This didn’t just happen overnight. This took a lot of years, four or five years of doing research and making sure that we give people a great product.”

“I do think Stella would be the bad cop for sure,” Mayo, 34, who plays firefighter Kidd, exclusively told Us Weekly while promoting season 13 of the NBC series.

She teased, “I think Kelly presents a stoic [exterior], but he would melt whenever his offspring was asking for something of him. He’d be like, ‘Yeah, yeah, yeah. Stella just give it to him.’”

At the end of season 12 of Chicago Fire, Severide (Taylor Kinney) told Kidd he was ready to start a family, which took her by surprise.

Related: Chicago Fire’s Kelly Severide and Stella Kidd’s Relationship Timeline Chicago Fire has been filled with red-hot romances throughout its run, but nothing compares to Kelly Severide’s relationship with Stella Kidd. When fans first met Kelly (played by Taylor Kinney), he was a rough and tough firefighter who was known for being a ladies’ man. However, the arrival of Stella (Miranda Rae Mayo) in season 4 […]

During season 13, which premiered in September 2024, Kidd revealed that she wants to be a mom and proposed going the adoption route since her aunt basically adopted and raised her as a kid.

“Stella is in love with Kelly. I don’t think she ever was a woman who wanted to be married. I don’t think she ever envisioned that type of, you know, wife and kids type of life for herself,” Mayo told Us, noting that Kidd’s relationship with Severide is what swayed her to change her tune.

The fictional […]

The actress explained, “She met this man and fell in love with this man and was like, ‘Hey, wherever you’re going, I’m going.’ We’re doing it together.”

While Mayo noted that Severide brought up the idea of expanding their family “much sooner” than Kidd was initially ready for, they have since gotten on the same page.

During season 13, episode 15, which aired on March 5, Kidd and Severide met with an adoption agency and, after a few hiccups at Firehouse 51, they were approved. It’s unclear whether the couple will become parents this season but, until then, Mayo told Us she’s enjoying the ride acting alongside Kinney, 43.

“I love working with him. My experience of working with Taylor is he’s a very present person,” Mayo revealed. “When we’re doing [a scene], I think neither one of us ever really knows what’s gonna happen.”

“She is in great shape mentally and physically,” Wendy’s brother Tommy Williams exclusively shared with Us Weekly on Wednesday, March 12. “Let her out.”

Since May 2022, Wendy, 60, has been living under a legal guardianship that oversees both her finances and health. Speculation surrounding the former radio host’s well-being and absence from the public eye led to a 2024 Lifetime documentary titled Where Is Wendy Williams?

This week, however, Us Weekly confirmed that Wendy was transported from her assisted living facility to a New York hospital “for evaluation” after police were called to do a wellness check.

Related: Wendy Williams‘ Health and Personal Struggles Over the Years Wendy Williams has made headlines for much more than her brutally honest opinions and on-air spats with her A-list interviewees. The talk show host has found herself face-to-face with numerous health and personal struggles, from struggling with a cocaine addiction in the beginning of her career, to more recently, battling Graves’ disease, hyperthyroidism and other […]

Wendy later appeared on The Breakfast Club and said she underwent competency tests, which she claimed to pass with “flying colors.”

According to her brother, Wendy’s ability to pass those recent tests is a positive step forward.

“Now she has some direction and understanding of her functional abilities and cognizant abilities,” Tommy told Us. “It’s a win for Wendy, a big one. And she did it herself. It also shows she is fluid with her thoughts and actions.”

Wendy’s friend Ginalia Monterrosa — who accompanied the media personality to the hospital this week — recently sent a letter to Adult Protective Services formally requesting a probe into what she saw as “troubling circumstances” surrounding Wendy’s treatment.

In an exclusive interview with Us, Monterrosa — who is part of Connect Care Advisory Group — said those closest to Wendy are “just figuring out next steps of what’s going to happen.”

Related: Everything Wendy Williams Has Said About Diddy Over the Years Wendy Williams and Sean “Diddy” Combs haven’t been on the best terms over the years. The drama between the pair began in the ‘90s when Williams spoke out against Diddy on her radio show Hot 97 on multiple occasions. In 1998, Williams was fired from the radio show and has maintained a “belief” that Diddy […]

“She is letting the public know it is unfair, it is unjust,” Monterrosa said of Wendy’s recent interviews. “She doesn’t need to be in a guardianship. She is not incapacitated. She will continue to voice her opinion.”

According to Monterrosa, Wendy is not allowed to have a cell phone at the facility she is residing in. Instead, she has a landline in her room that allows her to make outgoing calls, but doesn’t allow any to come in.

“We’d love for her to be in an unrestrictive environment — even at another facility — where she has freedom to come in and out, see her friends, people can call her, she can have an iPad, she can use a two-way phone — not just [a] one way [phone],” Monterrosa explained to Us. “[She has] the freedom to go to the store and supermarket, to go to the gym, to have a life and the things we take for granted.”

Before a judge makes a ruling in regards to Wendy’s guardianship, the former talk show host is expected to speak out on the Friday, March 14, episode of The View.

“Look at your hair! It’s fantastic,” William, 42, jokingly quipped on Tuesday, March 11, during a walkabout, per social media footage. “I wish I had hair like that, amazing!”

According to William, he “has the Charles.” (The Prince of Wales is the eldest son of King Charles III and his late ex-wife, Princess Diana.)

William visited an FA Referee Training Course at Aspray, which is the home of Sporting Khalsa FC in Willenhall, England. The visit was part of the prince’s duties as patron of the Football Association to highlight its “Reflective and Representative” campaign to recruit more individuals of color as referees.

“I don’t know if you guys have heard about the Earthshot Prize, but it’s an initiative I started about two years ago now, but it’s been about four years in the making,” he quipped in a July 2023 YouTube video. “I had hair when it started.”

Several months earlier, William’s brother, Prince Harry, made a pointed dig at his sibling’s hairline in his Spare memoir. Harry, 40, wrote about William’s “alarming baldness” and quipped that his resemblance to Diana was “fading with time.”

“In some ways he was my mirror, in some ways he was my opposite,” Harry wrote in the book published January 2023. “My beloved brother, my archnemesis, how had that happened?”

“It’s a super tough situation. The reality is it’s kind of reality, but it’s not reality,” PK, 57, exclusively told Us Weekly at the grand opening of New York City’s Planet Hollywood on Tuesday, March 11. “It gets mixed up. It gets edited. We say things, they don’t come out exactly as they were said. If you missed the sentence before, it changes the meaning, but we’re navigating it.”

He added, “Listen, we have to own the fact we did it. So this is our world and yeah, we’re OK.”

Dorit, 48, and PK announced in May 2024 that they were taking time apart after nine years of marriage. At the time, they still planned to amicably coparent son Jagger, 11, and daughter Phoenix, 9. While neither Dorit nor PK have yet to formally file for divorce, their breakup has remained a staple of conversation throughout RHOBH season 14.

“We’re going through what every couple goes through,” he said, “It’s not easy, but it’s not horrible either. She’s still Dorit [and] is still fabulous. She’s very chic!”

While Dorit is a main cast member on RHOBH, PK last appeared on a season 14 episode to meet up with Mauricio Umansky — who himself is separated from fellow Housewife Kyle Richards — for lunch. Despite the brief cameo, PK isn’t looking to make another appearance this season.

“I am done with reality,” PK proclaimed on Tuesday, teasing that he won’t make additional cameos on the Bravo hit. “I’m done. I’ve gotta go back to work.”

While the British real estate developer is no longer interested in appearing on RHOBH episodes, he’s not barring Dorit — or the kids — from their own reality TV future.

“I’ll support Dorit wherever I can,” PK stressed, further noting that Jagger and Phoenix are “doing good.”

What’s the Biggest Real Housewives of Beverly Hills Moment of All Time?

“They’re happy,” PK told Us. “We’re working together with the kids. We took them to Disney and we celebrate the birthdays together, so that’s all good.”

In between coparenting duties, PK stepped out to support Planet Hollywood’s CEO, Robert Earl, at the grand opening of the Times Square location.

“Robert is a very dear friend of mine [and] Jagger’s godfather,” PK gushed. “We’re excited to be here. It’s such a legacy brand, isn’t it? … I didn’t even know him when it first came out, [but] I met Robert about 20 years ago and we’ve become super close. I’m absolutely delighted to be here.”

“We always turned it down because we’re a little more private,” she shared. “But honestly, it’s inspiring to see someone like Alec, who I know is private, able to just kind of show off his family and go more deep into his life. It’s really fun to watch so you never know.”

Her comment comes a month after she filed for an emergency court hearing over concerns for her kids while they’re in Biermann’s care. Zolciak alleged that Biermann “has taken steps to completely cut the children off” from her and that he has an “inability to refrain from disparaging” her in front of their kids, according to court documents obtained by Us Weekly.

“His explosive temper raises concerns that [Biermann] is suffering from an undiagnosed mental health disorder which may require follow-up or treatment,” the documents read.

Zolciak previously accused Biermann of becoming physical with her during a dispute last November that resulted in a call to police. She alleged that Biermann forced her off of a ladder while she was taking down curtains and threw her to the ground. She claimed to have sustained injuries during the incident but refused to show them to police. Biermann, for his part, alleged that Zolciak instigated the altercation and struck him in the face.

Zolciak and Biermann filed for divorce in May 2023 after 11 years of marriage. They sold their Georgia mansion for $2.75 million in January one month after it went up for public auction as it faced foreclosure. They originally purchased the property in 2011 for $880,000.

The pair has engaged in a public back-and-forth throughout their divorce, particularly around their current financial situation.

“I’m the one who pays all the bills. All the kids’ clothes, all the school clothes, most of the food,” she said to TMZ in September. “He has not paid a bill in that house. He’s paid two electric bills in the last 18 months – not a cable [bill], water [bill], phone [bill], nothing. That man has not paid a bill in that house. [My daughter] Brielle has helped more than he has.”

Biermann responded to her claims via his lawyer Marlys A. Bergstrom, who told Us, “I find it ironic that this interview took place at LAX. Who’s watching the kids? The answer is Kroy. He’s in Georgia working 40-plus hours a week, taking care of the kids and trying to get the marital residence sold so that family can avoid foreclosure.”",usmagazine

“I think we didn’t think it through very much, which I look back now and I’m thinking ‘What were we thinking?’ But at the same time, I’m so glad that we didn’t because it is so raw and it is so true and it was a very vulnerable time,” Hilaria, 41, exclusively told Us Weekly at the grand opening of Planet Hollywood in Times Square on Tuesday, March 111. “It’s interesting to look back and even though it’s not that long ago, it really was a diary of how we were coping and moving forward.”

She added, “I’m very grateful that we did it and we were so lucky with the people that we did it with and I don’t say that lightly.”

Alec, 66, and Hilaria costarred with their seven young children — the 30 Rock alum also shares eldest daughter Ireland with ex-wife Kim Basinger — in TLC’s The Baldwins, which showcases the married couple’s family dynamics. Filming began shortly after Alec’s Rust fatal shooting scandal. (Alec fired a prop gun in 2021 that ultimately killed the film’s director of photography. He was indicted and charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter, which were dismissed at trial.)

“We’re so lucky because Sarah Reddy helped tell our story,” Hilaria told Us on Tuesday. “Howard Lee really, really is the one that believed in us and saw this. Just to be heard and seen and speak is such a special thing.”

Alec, meanwhile, joked to Us that he “didn’t make any decisions” during season 1.

“I didn’t have any input at all,” the actor quipped. “My wife and Sarah just shoved me around all day long for months.”

Alec also weighed on the possibility that filming The Baldwins could have impacted their marriage.

“Well, we’re always going to get a response [like] that [when doing] reality TV, among other things,” Alec said. “I hosted game shows and did Match Game for a while and that was all to put money in our foundation, to get to charity, and you’re always looking for alternative forums to do that with. And so, we did that and when you do things like this, people are always like, ‘Oh, this is another silly thing you’re doing.’ I really don’t care. We had fun.”

According to Hilaria, she and the kids also enjoyed the production.

While The Baldwins season 1 is currently airing on TLC, Hilaria teased that more episodes could be coming down the pipeline.

“We’ll see,” Hilaria hinted, before Alec chimed in to add that “she’ll be back.”

Alec and Hilaria took a break from filming and parenting alike to attend the grand opening party of Planet Hollywood in New York City.

“Well, I went to the opening of the original Planet Hollywood,” Alec recalled. “This was the beginning, I think, of that kind of movie star, celebrity-centered club restaurant. It was more like music and things like that — House of Blues eventually — but Danny Akroyd and those guys and these things were a huge success. And then, they kind of petered out. They’re reopening again, which is a great idea.”

Hilaria, for her part, was only “6 years old” when the eatery originally launched.

“But look at this!” she gushed. “This is such an iconic place. It really is, and we’re in the heart of New York, so it’s such a fun thing to be part of.”

“See, this comment’s really nice because not only is she calling me pretty, [but] she’s saying I’m not Tyler Cameron pretty,’ which is basically her saying I don’t look like a boy,” Madden quipped in a Tuesday, March 11, TikTok video. “She just thinks I’m really pretty.

Madden concluded, “It’s really nice of you.”

“Tate’s army is strong,” he wrote in the comments section. “Love y’all.”

Kelsey Anderson also concurred, replying, “She’s a fan.”

Cameron, best known as the runner-up on The Bachelorette season 15, and Madden have been together since 2023.

“So Tyler and I actually met a couple times before he remembered meeting me. I thought Tyler and I were actually good friends. Turns out he didn’t know who I was,” she recalled on the “Trading Secrets” podcast in November 2024, adding that they were introduced by mutual pals.

While Cameron and Madden continue to be loved up, there are some lingering fears about embarking on a future together.

“[Having kids is] a fear I have, and it has nothing to do with Tate,” he said on “Trading Secrets” in November 2024. “It’s just when I grew up, I had parents who busted their asses and worked their asses off for us, gave us everything they had. We lost everything in the [2008 stock] market crash.”

Cameron added, “We went from having everyone together, living this dream life in this dream house, to losing it all, losing the house, losing the family and then moving back to a little house, and then having all types of drama and s— and losing what our family was at that point.”

According to Cameron, he wants to be in a “financially set place” before expanding his family.

“I think right now, just doubling down and just working as much as we can to get to that spot so then when we do hopefully have kids one day, God willing, that he can also be the dad that he wants to be,” Madden added at the time. “Never miss a game, be the coach, do all the things.

After trying some new golf clubs and not being thrilled with the results, the professional golfer decided to stick to what he knows and loves.

“He started the week here at Bay Hill with some newer model TaylorMade woods,” McIlroy’s coach and confidant, Brad Faxon, said on the Monday, March 10, episode of the “Sky Sports Golf” podcast. “On Sunday morning, he had his older set that he used to win at AT&T, he had them Ubered from his house Saturday night, which is pretty extraordinary to have those shipped up.”

Thanks to an Uber driver, who likely drove nearly two and a half hours to reach McIlroy’s location, the golfer was able to reunite with his clubs before The Players Championship kicks off Thursday, March 13.

“I think he’s a little more comfortable with [the clubs] that he will use this week at the Players Championship,” Faxon, 63, explained. “Those clubs have slightly more spin for him. As we know, Rory doesn’t need more speed. You need a little bit more control.”

McIlroy, 35, is expected to compete in The Players Championship, which is an annual golf tournament on the PGA Tour. Located in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, the course will feature some of the best athletes in the sport including Scottie Scheffler, Xander Schauffele and Collin Morikawa.

So far, Faxon likes what he sees as McIlroy prepares to compete in the tournament, which will be available to stream on Disney+ and ESPN+.

“There’s nothing prettier in golf than seeing Rory hammer a draw down a fairway or into a green,” Faxon shared. “I love his confidence on the greens and around the greens.”

One golfer who will not be competing in The Players Championship is Tiger Woods.

“I didn’t think much about it,” De Niro, 81, admitted on the Tuesdsay, March 11, episode of Late Night with Seth Meyers.

De Niro received his first Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for playing Don Vito Corleone in 1974’s The Godfather Part II. During his interview with late-night host Seth Meyers, he revealed that the reason he wasn’t in attendance was because he was busy filming a movie in Italy. In fact, he didn’t even find out he’d won the Oscar until the next morning.

“I was doing [1976 historical drama] 1900 with [director] Bernardo Bertolucci in Northern Italy. It’s nine hours later there so I got a call early in the morning that I had won the Academy Award,” he remembered.

And we’d tell [Leo], ‘You don’t need that dialogue,’” Scorsese, 80, told the Wall Street Journal […]

When Meyers asked whether De Niro considered watching the Oscars on TV, he admitted, “I don’t know, in those days, whether you could watch it [in other countries] … I didn’t think that I was going to win.”

De Niro remembered having a very brief and casual phone call with someone in the U.S. where he thanked the caller for informing him about the career-defining moment. He was the only Best Supporting Actor nominee missing on Oscar night when Ryan O’Neal and his daughter Tatum O’Neal announced the category winner.

The Godfather Part II director Francis Ford Coppola – who won Best Director and Best Picture that night – was called up to the stage to accept the award on De Niro’s behalf.

“I think this is a very richly-deserved award,” Coppola told viewers. “I think Robert De Niro is an extraordinary actor and he is going to enrich the films that are made for years to come.”

De Niro won his second Oscar six years later, this time for Best Actor, in recognition of playing down-and-out boxer Jake LaMotta in director Martin Scorsese‘s 1980 sports drama Raging Bull. De Niro was in attendance on Oscar night to personally accept the trophy for the second time around.

“I want to thank my mother and father for having me, and my grandfather and grandmother for having them,” he joked, before declaring: “I love everyone!”

De Niro has received nine total Oscar nominations throughout his acclaimed career, most recently getting a Best Supporting Actor nod in 2024 for portraying Oklahoma crime boss William King Hale in Killers of the Flower Moon.

Elsewhere, the actor recently offered some behind-the-scenes insight on another of his classic roles, when he confirmed to Live with Kelly and Mark in February that his unforgettable “Are you taking to me?” scene from Taxi Driver was partially improvised.

Rodriguez, 61, announced on Monday, March 10 that players would not be permitted to dance on TikTok while members of his roster.

“They’re going to be on it, so I’m not banning them from it,” Rodriguez told reporters of the popular social media platform. “I’m just banning them from dancing on it. It’s like, look, we try to have a hard edge or whatever, and you’re in there in your tights dancing on TikTok, ain’t quite the image of our program that I want.”

He added, “I’m allowed to do that. I can have rules. Twenty years from now, if they want to be sitting in their pajamas in the basement eating Cheetos and watching TikTok or whatever the hell, they can go at it, smoking cannabis, whatever. Knock yourself out.”

Freeman, 39, posted a picture of the bobblehead via Instagram on Thursday, March 6, calling it “the perfect addition to my office.” The bobblehead was situated on Freeman’s desk next to […]

Instead, Rodriguez said he hopes his players can remain concentrated on their gridiron goals instead of the latest social media dance trends.

“I hope our focus can be on winning football games,” he concluded. “How about let’s win the football game and not worry about winning the TikTok?”

Rodriguez’s TikTok dancing ban earned plenty of criticism on social media for a variety of reasons.

“Rich Rod is antiquated, but he isn’t obtuse,” one person wrote via X. “So he delegitimizes a pathway for his athletes to carve out a brand for their own financial futures. He creates a chilling effect on self-determination and remains undoubtedly in control.”

Another wrote, “Not only is RichRod banning his players from dancing on TikTok (a string of words I never thought I’d write together) a potential employment issue but it also likely violates the athletes’ First Amendment rights.”

TikTok has become an increasingly popular space for college athletes, including former Colorado superstar Travis Hunter.

A native of West Virginia, Rodriguez was previously head coach of the Mountaineers from 2001 to 2007.

“I am thrilled to have the opportunity to be the head football coach at West Virginia University,” Rodriguez said in a statement after his hiring in December. “My family and I are filled with gratitude to lead the Mountaineer football program again and look forward to working with the many supporters, fans, and friends to build the best football program in America!

After sliding into her DMs in 2022, Russell and Kramer, 41, welcomed a son, Roman, into world a year later in November 2023. The pair then became husband and wife in July 2024 in Scotland — or so we thought.

During the Wednesday, March 12, episode of her podcast, “Whine Down With Jana Kramer,” Kramer and Russell, 44, answered their fans’ burning questions.

One of those questions: “Did they get married before the Scotland wedding?”

“I think we should answer it,” Kramer said to Russell, who couldn’t quite understand why anyone would care about when they got married.

As Kramer continued, the actress admitted she understood where the question was coming from because Russell started wearing his wedding ring January 2024, seven months before their actually wedding.

And I mean, I’ve got friends who’ve waited years, and then […]

“Yeah, we got married in January, and we made it formal to people in July,” Kramer said, adding it was nice to keep that piece of information between them for the last 15 months.

“We were desperate to marry each other,” the couple said on the podcast. “So what we did was, after we had a Roman, we still had that feeling, like, ‘This is so weird that we’re not married, you know, officially, and we have a son together.’ And so we went to the courthouse in January.”

Kramer and Russell wanted to keep their informal wedding just that, so a “simple notary” made it official.

Kramer noted that she didn’t want to exchange vows or do anything special in January because she wanted to save it all for their formal wedding in July.

“Our wedding date is July 13. We just made it official a little earlier,” Kramer continued.

“But there was something so beautiful and just, private and precious about us holding that together and it just being like, just us having that together without the whole world,” she added.

During the same podcast episode, Kramer and Russell also discussed the possibility of having more children together.

Kramer has two children, Jolie, 9, and Jace, 7, from her marriage to Mike Caussin. Kramer and Russell share their son, Roman, 1.

At first, Russell answered with a quick and hard, “No,” before a shocked Kramer said she was considering the idea of having another child.

“I think we should be grateful for how great that one went,” Russell said, talking about their son. “I don’t think we should.”

Kramer on the other hand told Russell that she thinks they should at least try.

“What if we try for three months?” she asked Russell. “And if it doesn’t happen, we tried it.”",usmagazine

Earle, 24, has been receiving criticism from fans for her outfits since the 2025 Super Bowl, when she wore an all-leather look in the New Orleans heat. On Tuesday, March 11, she took to TikTok to show off her Miu Miu Paris Fashion Week outfit.

“I’m very excited about the socks with the heels,” Earle said as she gave fans a glimpse of her shiny blue ensemble spread on a bed.

She then turned the camera to her stylist, Danyul Brown, who joked, “And guys, I just ask that you count to 10 and breathe.” He added, “It’s not World War. We’re just having fun.”

Earle then cracked up in the background of the video, clearly unbothered by the hate comments she’s received about her fashion sense.

“My stylist preparing for the attack he’s going to get when I wear socks with heels today,” Earle captioned the post. “Happy Miu Miu day 😭.”

Fans were quick to poke fun at her getup which was finished with a leather Moto jacket, a white bodysuit, a coordinating handbag, knit leg warmers and strappy white kitten heels.

“THIS is the culprit!!! 🤣,” one follower joked of Earle’s stylist reveal. “Why does he h8 you so much?! 😩😩,” a second added. A third commented, “I counted to 10. I breathed. still gonna be a no from me. He has failed us too many times.” While some social media users weren’t here for Earle’s fit — which by the way, matched the vibe of the runway and other stars who attended, including Sydney Sweeney — others loved the toeless sock moment.

“Everyone in this comment section saying no has clearly not seen the other celebs also doing socks in heels at the Miu Miu show. It’s a moment okay!🩵😭,” one fan defended her look.

https://usmagazine.com,Biggest Takeaways From Octomom's Return to the Spotlight,https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/biggest-takeaways-from-octomoms-return-to-the-spotlight/,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 20:36:29 GMT","Natalie “Nadya” Suleman retreated from the public eye in 2013, but now she’s back — and sharing her side of the story.

Suleman rose to fame in 2009 after getting pregnant with octuplets via IVF. That same year, she welcomed Noah, Maliyah, Isaiah, Nariyah, Jonah, Makai, Josiah and Jeremiah Suleman is also mom to six older children: Elijah (born in 2001), Amerah (born in 2002), Joshua (born in 2003), Aiden (born in 2005) and fraternal twins Calyssa and Caleb (born in 2006).

As she prepares for the release of her Lifetime film, I Was Octomom (Saturday, March 8), and docuseries, Confessions of Octomom (Monday, March 10), Suleman is reflecting on her life.

“I wasn’t happy as an only child, and clearly I projected my dream onto my kids and wanting a big, well, not this big of a family, but I did want seven kids,” she told People. “But it’s not enough to say I wanted a big family because I was lonely. There is an amalgamation of factors. I wanted kids to create maybe a safe and predictable little world that I lacked growing up. So then of course, I projected onto my future family.”

Scroll down to see the biggest takeaways from Suleman’s return to the spotlight:

Her 1 ‘Regret’

Suleman had multiple back-to-back rounds of IVF administered by Dr. Michael Kamrava. While the recommended standard practice is to implant two embryos, Kamrava implanted her with 12.

Suleman, who wanted “just one more” baby, was told by Kamrava that he had only implanted six embryos. He later admitted to planting 12 and his professional medical license was revoked.

“I don’t think I’d do too much differently,” Suleman told People. “I do regret not suing the infertility doctor. I definitely regret that because his insurance would’ve been the one paying, and it would’ve been some millions, and it would’ve been helpful for my family.”

She continued, “I regret that I kind of threw myself under the bus to cover for him, and I shouldn’t have but I was grateful. I wouldn’t have had any of my kids if it weren’t for his innovative technique. No one else in the world did this type of procedure so I didn’t have it in my heart to sue him,” she said.

However, Suleman “did sue the hospital because they breached HIPAA,” claiming that hospital employees reportedly shared her information. “They’re the reason why I ended up in the public eye.”

Related: Octomom Nadya Suleman's Kids Recall 'Death Threats' and More in Doc Trailer Octomom Nadya Suleman’s 14 children have a lot to say in the new trailer for the upcoming docuseries Confessions of Octomom. “At the time my mom was getting a lot of death threats,” one of Suleman’s daughters claimed to the cameras in the Wednesday, February 26, trailer for the upcoming Lifetime series which premieres on […]

Her Financial Status — And ‘Biggest Misconception’

Suleman is setting the record straight on her financial situation after rising to fame. “At the time, I was not unemployed. I was on disability,” she told People.

Despite being accused of receiving and using government assistance to conceive her children, Suleman said, “That was a lie.”

“I did not use taxpayers’ money. I’d saved so much money working as a psychiatric technician at a state psych hospital,” she said. “I saved well over a hundred thousand dollars. I used all of that money. Instead of buying a house I bought in vitros. I also had an inheritance close to $60,000 that paid for it too, which I’m not proud of. It should have gone for my older kids. I also got student loans, but I paid for everything, period.”

Suleman’s financial situation became more dire after welcoming her octuplets, leading her to participate in paid interviews, photo opportunities and a solo adult film.

“I’ve never wanted fame,” she said. “That’s a No. 1 biggest misconception ever. I sued the hospital because they were the reason I ended up in the public eye.” She added, “I did whatever I needed to do to make ends meet. And that was shaming myself, sacrificing my integrity. The life I was leading was not only destructive, it was dark. It was the antithesis of who I am as a person.”

In 2013, the year she left the spotlight, Suleman said the family was struggling financially “more than ever.” Suleman went back into her “old profession as a therapist working 40 hours a week.”

She added, “I used my education. For years I was typecast as the welfare recipient, unemployed mother, all of which is wrong.”

Five years later, Suleman left her job when son Aidan’s “needs were becoming overwhelming.”

“I’ve always been his only provider, but I never got paid,” she said of her son, who is autistic. “So in 2018, that’s when I started to get actually paid. It’s decent money, but it’s still nothing compared to what we need to make to be comfortable in life.”

Now, Suleman and 11 of her 14 kids live in a three-bedroom townhouse apartment in Orange County, California. The family receives support from members of the community, including one couple who “offered us to live here half the rent just because they’re good Christian people. People at church have made a positive difference.”

Her Love Life — And Being Celibate

Before welcoming her octuplets, Suleman was married to Marcos Gutierrez. The pair separated in 2000 and officially divorced six years later. Looking back, Suleman told People that it “wasn’t a real marriage.”

“I was married, but on paper. He was just a donor and I only tried to pacify my very, very old-fashioned Middle Eastern family on my dad’s side, where some of the marriages are still pre-arranged,” she said.

Her first six children were conceived from a “platonic friend donor,” while the octuplets “have a frozen anonymous donor.” Suleman always knew she wanted a family, but without a partner.

“I’ve never really dated,” she said. “I had one relationship and I was very up front with him and said, ‘I’m really only interested in having a child. Wonderful guy, very nice, funny, great guy. And he had feelings, but I didn’t really reciprocate them. But I was open with him. I was never hiding the fact that I just wanted a child and he tried to help me, but it didn’t work out.”

Suleman revealed that she has been celibate for 25 years. “That’s actually something I’m really proud of,” she said. “And for me, being a romantic asexual person, it just fits perfectly. I’m never going to change that. It’s who I am as a person, down to the fabric of my soul.”

When Suleman participated in an adult film, she was alone. “I knew I could not touch another human being physically,” she said. “That’s where I drew the line.”

Her Death Threats

In the trailer for Suleman’s upcoming Lifetime series, one of her daughters claimed to the cameras that, “At the time my mom was getting a lot of death threats.”

One of Suleman’s sons also sat down with producers, sharing his experience of having people approach him to ask about his mom’s past. (Aside from her adult film, she previously worked as a stripper in men’s clubs.)

“When someone comes up to you at school and asks you, ‘Is your mom a stripper?’ You don’t know what to say,” the son said.

Hospital Frenzy

During a March 7 interview with Today, Suleman claimed that the hospital gave a press conference without her consent. She also alleged that the facility refused to discharge her until she “found a manager to help control the chaos” of the media frenzy.

“It was that professor, that manager, that was trying to protect me who confiscated my phone,” Suleman said, noting she opted for a professor to help her since she was in grad school at the time. “And said as soon as I finished this interview — I called it an interrogation — I could see my kids.”

Looking back on it now, Suleman confessed that she “would have refused” if she had known she could.

“I didn’t even know I had that right as a patient to refuse,” she continued. “I wish I had some legal assistance at that time.”

Single Parent Bias

Suleman told Today that if she had gone through her pregnancy with a partner by her side, she believes she would have received less scrutiny.

“If I were in a relationship and were married, it would have acted as a buffer to being a that target of that hate, of that downward social comparison,” she reflected.

“It’s difficult for me. I think the clearest thing for me is that I’ll always support Emmy and her position on the show. I think that I have probably ruffled some feathers by not going to the reunion,” Will said on the Wednesday, March 12, episode of the “Viall Files” podcast, before clarifying that he had “certainly ruffled some feathers,” adding, “I regret it a little bit.”

Will was absent from the season 3 reunion when the cast met up in New York City, with Emmy telling host Andy Cohen that he was backstage, but didn’t come out due to mental health reasons. (In the season 3 finale of Southern Hospitality, Will was accused of letting a brunette live with him at law school and taking her to a law prom. In response, Will alleged that the woman was a friend from law school, who Emmy knew was staying at the apartment. The allegations came after he was accused of cheating on Emmy in both seasons 2 and 3 of the show.)

When host Nick Viall asked on Wednesday why Will didn’t return to the reunion in an effort to plead his case, the Bravo personality explained that “because of the way that the show had portrayed me and our relationship, it felt like that I would have to dig myself out from under a mountain.”

“The ways that I would address it would need a longform segment just to try to break down all the nuances. On top of that, the people on the stage I knew are just very interested in whether or not they are making it to the next season and are sort of willing to say or do whatever. It was just going to be a bloodbath,” he continued. “It wasn’t like I could come on here and explain to you guys, ‘Hey, this is what happened,’ and we could have an engaging conversation. It would have been sort of two-steps forward, one-step back, two-steps forward, one-step back.”

Will explained that “these people aren’t my friends anymore,” claiming that they would have come on stage and “try to act” like they were pals to use that “as a position of power” to engage with him in a “fake conversation.” Will admitted that his mental health “couldn’t take it.”

“I’m still on the fence,” Will said about returning for season 4. “I think there are some conversations I need to have about how the show is filmed. I also think that the two most important things in my life right now are my relationship and what’s left of my legal career after all this. I just don’t see reality TV as a format where relationships thrive.”

Will admitted that he questioned “whether this is the right thing for me,” adding, “When I look at Emmy, I think she’s a star.”",usmagazine
https://usmagazine.com,Sammy Hagar Mourns Fan Who Gave Him 'Red Rocker' Nickname,https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/sammy-hagar-mourns-fan-who-gave-him-red-rocker-nickname/,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 20:02:42 GMT","Former Van Halen frontman Sammy Hagar paid tribute to a long-time fan responsible for a pivotal moment in his career.

“Rest in peace my friend and be sure to give Eddie [Van Halen] a big hug from me,” Hagar 77, wrote via Facebook on Monday, March 12.

Hagar penned a stirring tribute to John Pruner, the fan who he credited with giving him the nickname “The Red Rocker.” The singer explained that his long association with Pruner dated back to the late 1970s, just after he’d released his self-titled second studio album.

Fans affectionately refer to Hagar’s 1977’s self-titled record as “The Red Album” because Hagar is depicted on its cover wearing a crimson button-up shirt and surrounded by a red car and a brick building. Since the album’s signature track is also titled “Red,” fans naturally started associating Hagar with the color.

In his remembrance for Pruner, Hagar wrote that the super-fan came up with a perfect moniker for him when he once asked for an autograph.

“I was checking out of the hotel and John Pruner, the man in these photos, stopped me and asked for an autograph on the newspaper review of the concert. He asked me to sign it ‘The Red Rocker’ – that was the beginning of being the Red Rocker,” he confirmed.

Hagar even credited Pruner with being “the first redhead before the fans became [known as] redheads.”

“He followed me around the country, showing up everywhere,” the rocker remembered. “I got to know him well. Later, at a birthday bash in Cabo, he showed me that he had paid to see over 100 shows! I said, ‘You will never pay to see me again’ and gave him the golden lifetime all access pass. That was well over 100 shows ago.”

The musician developed a close bond with Pruner off stage in recent years, recalling how his friend’s “health [had] been failing him for well over a decade” before his death.

Per medical examiner records viewed by Us Weekly, Baena died by suicide. “This is an unimaginable tragedy,” Plaza’s rep said in a statement to Us […]

“He still managed to make as many shows as he could in wheelchairs, I always made room for him on the side of the stage or wherever possible,” Hagar remembered. “Some of you might recall me giving him a shout out FaceTime from the stage when he would be in the hospital and couldn’t make the shows. His friend Jon, as well, took care of him and made sure those things happened. God bless him for that.”

The singer concluded: “Well, we lost the original number one redhead a couple nights ago. we will miss you, John pruner and the show will go on without you. I know you wouldn’t have it any other way.”

At the time of the iconic “Red Album” release, Hagar had recently left hard rock band Montrose to strike it out as a solo act. He scored his biggest solo hit with 1984’s “I Can’t Drive 55,” which hit No. 9 on the U.S. Top Rock Tracks chart that year.

Hagar was picked as David Lee Roth‘s replacement as Van Halen’s frontman in 1985, and went on to front the heavy metal group for 11 years. His debut album with Van Halen, 1986’s 5150, sold more than six million copies and has been certified six-times platinum.

Following his departure from Van Halen in 1996, Hagar resumed his solo career and even coheadlined the Song for Song, the Heavyweight Champs of Rock and Roll Tour with Roth in 2002 before reuniting with Van Halen the next year for the Best of Both Worlds Tour. Van Halen cofounder and lead guitarist Eddie Van Halen died at age 65 from throat cancer in October 2020.

Hagar has since continued recording and touring with his backing back the Waboritas, and also formed the supergroup Chickenfoot with Van Halen bassist Michael Anthony, Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith and influential guitarist Joe Satriani in 2008.

Earlier this season, Scola was briefly paired with Sydney Ortiz (Lisette Olivera). However, she left for a different gig with the bureau after episode 8.

Since then, Scola has teamed up with both Maggie and OA together as well as partnering with them one-on-one. That dynamic is something Zaki told Us will continue before the new agent joins the force.

“What’s kind of exciting [with] the next few episodes [is] the ones that we all have off sort of line up,” Zaki shared. “You’re going to see a lot more of one of us not being there and things like that.”

Even with the mixing of partners, Zaki said it will be seamless on the job. “We’ve all been working together now for six years. [OA] and Maggie seven, but Scola came in season 2, so the dynamic between the three of us is always really great,” he explained.

The personal shakeup, however, does mean that Maggie and OA, who have worked together since season 1 of the series, have been apart for a significant amount of time.

“It tees us up for a great kind of reunion moment for Maggie and OA when we get back together on screen,” Zaki teased. “It’s a fun new sort of thing to play.”

No matter what the pairing, Zaki promised a lot of high intensity cases to wrap up the remainder of the season. (During the Tuesday, March 11, episode, OA took down a group of train hijackers solo while trying to protect his girlfriend, Gemma, who was accidentally shot in the attack.)

“We face some eco terrorists, we face some cartel, we get some more traditional cases here and there,” he told Us, adding, “The stakes keep rising and somehow we keep finding a way to do these really exciting episodes.”

Zaki noted that FBI’s final two episodes have yet to film, so he’s not sure what the finale will entail. However, based on past patterns, he is hopeful OA will be front and center for them both.

“Usually, OA gets a heavy one in the last few [episodes]. So we’ll see if there’s one more in the bucket for him,” he shared.

“I believe I was under the bed one time when you and your ex-husband were trying [to get pregnant],” Kardashian, 40, said on the Wednesday, March 12, episode of the Khloé in Wonder Land” podcast. “I still go to therapy over that.”

“I ran out and you guys were like, ‘What was that?’ At first, we were like, ‘Oh my God’ and a little giggling, and then you guys were like, ‘I think I hear something,’” Kardashian recalled. “When you guys said that, we ran.”

Dawn Robinson, the leading voice for R&B powerhouses En Vogue, Lucy Pearl, and even Dr. Dre's Firm supergroup at one point, is cleaning out her closet ... revealing she's been homeless, sleeping in her car for nearly 3 years.

The brave and shocking revelation came on Dawn's YouTube channel in a vid titled, ""YOUR NEW LIFE IS IN THE SCARY 🫣"" ... her channel sat dormant for a year and 6 months before Tuesday.

Dawn explains she fell on hard times during the pandemic and had been staying with her parents in Vegas before that situation fizzled.

She says her former co-manager convinced her to move back to L.A., where he strung her along, putting her in a hotel instead of helping her secure an apartment.

Dawn says she frustratingly started to research the culture of car-living and, to her surprise, learned she could easily adapt.

While she doesn't own a home, Dawn says she does have a membership at a gym, where she takes showers.

She credited her ex-boyfriend's mom, personal assistant Niecy, her brother Evin, and Klymaxx singer Joyce Irby for being her foundation ... but scolded her sister for wronging her in the past.

It's an interesting revelation ... En Vogue just performed (without Dawn) during the 2025 NBA All-Star Weekend for their Oakland hometown.

Former NBA player Eddie Johnson broke the news on Wednesday ... expressing his sadness as he announced Miller's passing.

""We have lost another @NBA Fraternity member!"" Johnson said. ""Going to miss you Big O. 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾. RIP.""

Miller was a standout athlete at Southwest High School in Fort Worth, Texas before committing to the University of Arkansas to play for the Razorbacks. He was the SWC Player of the Year and named First-team All-SWC in 1991.

The Phoenix Suns selected the center with the 22nd overall pick in the 1992 NBA Draft ... and he played there for two seasons.

He also had short stints with the Detroit Pistons, Toronto Raptors, Dallas Mavericks, Sacramento Kings and Minnesota Timberwolves in his nine-year NBA career.

Miller -- who became the heaviest player in league history -- averaged 7.4 points, 5.9 rebounds and 1.5 blocks per game.

Miller then took his talents to the Continental Basketball Association, where he earned All-Star honors and was named to the All-CBA Second Team.

He last played in 2010 for the Premier Basketball League's Lawton-Fort Sill Cavalry.

Martin tells us while Rachel, who plays Snow White, and Gal, as the Evil Queen, are entitled to their own political views and ideals, those personal opinions shouldn’t have overshadowed everyone else’s hard work -- no matter how much bitching about them is on social media.

Martin's no stranger to big Disney premieres -- having played the fan-favorite Marty in the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' series – and says ""Snow White"" deserved to be a major event ... not just a ho-hum screening ... which it is, in comparison.

Variety reported yesterday Disney is significantly scaling back the film's premiere due to multiple controversies, including reactions to the 2 female stars' political stances.

As for the other controversy with Little People not playing the dwarfs IRL, Martin tells us that as far as he knows, motion-capture was always the plan and was not a knee-jerk reaction to Peter Dinklage blasting the project when it was announced.

That said ... Martin tells us it's unbelievably difficult for Little People to land Hollywood roles, let alone lead ones, so this could have been a bigger opportunity for others.

A former Illinois police chief may want a refresher on the Miranda Rights ... 'cause he didn't exercise his right to remain silent -- instead choosing to berate the cops who arrested him for DUI in shocking body cam video.

Walter Klimek -- former chief of police in Bridgeview, a suburb of Chicago -- was arrested one afternoon in December in the nearby town of Justice ... and the footage from the road shows the moments leading up to cops slapping the cuffs on him.

Check out the clip ... it starts with Klimek refusing to get out of the car -- repeatedly screaming ""Let me go"" while in park -- as officers gather around the vehicle.

One officer says Klimek had just been in a pretty bad car wreck -- it looks like airbags deployed throughout the vehicle -- and, they're telling him to get out of the car ... but, Walter just gestures forward like he's ready to keep on driving.

Eventually, an officer has to climb in through the back to unbuckle his seatbelt, and they start dragging him out ... leading Klimek to scream in sheer agony. It's unclear if he's in actual pain or just throwing a temper tantrum -- but, either way, the cops are not happy.

With traffic backed up on the roadway, Klimek's loaded onto a stretcher -- where he profusely apologizes to cops through heavy sobs -- before he's hauled off to the station.

Once there, Walter's told his car was towed -- which he fervently denies, though an officer is telling him they called the tow truck themselves -- and that he's been arrested for DUI.

Klimek's shocked at the arrest too ... claiming he's not drunk, despite his obvious slurred speech and confusion. The officer responds that it's not up for debate -- 'cause Klimek had already been charged.

Klimek was charged with misdemeanor resisting arrest and DUI. He was taken to a hospital, but he refused to have blood drawn that would've been used to determine his blood-alcohol level.

Chicago station WGN-TV reports Klimek had allegedly been speeding when he hit a guardrail and lost control, hitting another car and injuring another person.

Farrah Abraham is just one day away from making her big career switch to comedy ... and she's been getting tips from some seasoned pros in the game!
