Oops, something went wrong

We recently published a list of 10 Tech News Updates Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) stands against other tech news updates investors should not miss.

On March 6th, CoreWeave, an Nvidia-backed cloud-computing startup, denied claims in a Financial Times report that Microsoft had pulled the plug in some of the agreements it had signed with the cloud provider due to service delivery challenges and missed deadlines.

“We pride ourselves in our client partnerships and there have been no contract cancellations or walking away from commitments. Any claim to the contrary is false and misleading,” a CoreWeave spokesperson told Reuters in an emailed statement.

The news follows after Stack Capital Group made an investment of $10 million in the AI-infrastructure company, according to a company release on March 5th.

“Given its growing data center presence across the United States, Europe, and Canada, CoreWeave is extremely well-positioned to continue capitalizing on accelerating global demand for AI infrastructure and compute capabilities,” said Jeff Parks, CEO of Stack Capital.

According to a Reuters report on March 7th, the Azure parent has begun testing out models from xAI, Meta and DeepSeek to develop AI models to compete with OpenAI.

For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds, as of Q4 2024.

At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is a computer technology company that offers a comprehensive and fully integrated stack of cloud applications and cloud platform services. On March 7th, TD Cowen maintained a buy rating on the company, with a steady price target of $210.00 backed by the firm's expectations of its new Stargate partnership which aims to invest around $500 billion over four years in AI infrastructure across the US. Oracle, along with OpenAI and Softbank, have identified locations in Texas for new data centers, while the company has also partnered with Google to enhance the Oracle Database@Google Cloud's capabilities.

Overall, ORCL ranks 2nd on our list of tech news updates investors should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of ORCL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ORCL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

World's First Modular Quantum Computer Operates at Room Temperature

A quantum computer capable of functioning at room temperature has been developed, marking a major advancement in the field. Named Aurora, the system operates using light-based qubits and connects multiple modules through fibre optic cables. This approach aims to address key challenges in quantum computing, including scalability, fault tolerance, and error correction. The technology, designed by Xanadu, a Toronto-based quantum computing company, demonstrates the potential for networked quantum computers that do not require extreme cooling measures.

According to a study published in Nature, Aurora is the first quantum system that operates at scale while being entirely photonic. Traditional quantum computers rely on superconducting qubits that require near-absolute zero temperatures to function effectively. These systems face significant challenges due to heat generation and complex cooling infrastructure. By utilising photonic qubits instead of superconducting ones, Xanadu's researchers have created a system that integrates seamlessly into existing fibre optic networks.

As reported, Christian Weedbrook, CEO and founder of Xanadu, explained that the industry's primary challenges lie in improving quantum error correction and achieving scalability. The system has been designed with smaller, interconnected modules rather than a single large unit. Speaking to the publication, Darran Milne, CEO of VividQ and an expert in quantum information theory, noted that while dividing a quantum system into multiple components may improve error correction, it has been seen whether this approach will ultimately reduce errors or compound them.

The system integrates 35 photonic chips linked by 13 kilometres of fibre optic cables. Researchers believe this framework could enable large-scale quantum data centres, facilitating applications such as drug discovery simulations and secure quantum cryptography. According to Xanadu, future efforts will focus on minimising optical signal loss in fibre connections to enhance performance.

News regarding Apple's foldable iPhone has been circulating for quite some time. Recently, it was reported that the company might launch the Foldable iPhone in the market by next year. Just as discussions about this device were heating up, new rumors emerged about a foldable iPad as well. According to leaked information, Apple is currently developing a foldable iPad featuring an 18.8-inch display.

If these leaks are accurate, Apple is working on a Foldable iPad Pro, and a prototype has already surfaced. This prototype suggests that the device could come equipped with an Under Display Face ID feature. Notably, this would mark the first instance of such technology in a device, as only Samsung currently has under-display Face ID capabilities. If the rumors hold true, this development could pose serious challenges for Samsung in the foldable smartphone market moving forward.

While Apple has yet to officially announce anything about the Foldable iPad, the leaks indicate that the company might aim for a launch by the end of 2027. Furthermore, prior information from the Wall Street Journal hinted that Apple is also developing a foldable device designed to function as a compact laptop; when opened, this device would boast a display size of around 19 inches.

In other news, Apple is gearing up to unveil its slimmest iPhone yet this year, potentially called the iPhone 17 Air. Recent reports have shed light on various details surrounding this groundbreaking smartphone, including its expected launch date and features. If the rumors are accurate, the iPhone 17 Air could emerge as the thinnest smartphone globally, showcasing a design that prioritizes a lightweight construction. 

Notably, it's anticipated to incorporate a silicon carbon battery, setting it apart from its predecessors. The iPhone 17 Air is anticipated to launch sometime in September this year, potentially during an event scheduled between September 9 and 11.

Indian stock market: Kaynes Technology India, a leading player in end-to-end IoT solutions and integrated electronics manufacturing, saw its shares plunge 9.15% in early morning trade on March 12, to hit a 2-week low of  ₹3,898 apiece after the company, in an exchange filing on Tuesday, disclosed that its Managing Director, Mr. Ramesh Kunhikannan, has received a show-cause notice from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).

'The Notice alleges suspected violations in the maintenance of the Structured Digital Database (SDD) pertaining to financial results for the period ended March 31, 2023, as per the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015," the company said in a regulatory filing.

"We are currently reviewing the contents of the Notice and will take all appropriate legal and procedural steps, including providing a timely response to SEBI. The company, the Noticee, and all concerned remain committed to fully cooperating with SEBI to resolve this matter in accordance with the applicable legal and regulatory framework," the company added.

The company shares have been falling recently, especially after the electronics equipment maker trims its FY25 revenue forecast. Although the company reported a 47% YoY jump in its consolidated net profit, it came lower than the street estimates, prompting analysts to cut the target price on the stock.

Global brokerage firm Jefferies upgrades Kaynes Technology India from 'Hold' to 'Buy' while lowering the price target to  ₹5,400 from  ₹6,950. Meanwhile, Japanese brokerage firm Nomura revises the price target for Kaynes Technology India to  ₹6,146 from  ₹6,516, maintaining its 'Buy' rating

Over the last three months (including the current month), the shares have tumbled 44.5%, ending February with a 13.53% decline, followed by January's 35.99% drop, which was the biggest monthly decline since its listing in December 2022.

However, in the long term, the stock is still up 328% over the last two years and 600% over the past three years.

The logistics arm of e-commerce giant JD.com reported its 2024 revenue grew nearly 10%, as external customers contributed 70% of the total

By Teri Yu

JD Logistics Inc. (2618.HK) reported 9.7% revenue growth and a record profit last year, as it diversified its customer base beyond its parent, e-commerce giant JD.com, and boosted its margins through steady technology upgrades and other efficiencies.

The company reported revenue of 182.8 billion yuan ($25.6 billion) for 2024, with external customers supplying 127.8 billion yuan, or about 70% of its total, according to its results released on last Friday. It recorded a non-IFRS annual profit of 7.92 billion yuan, nearly triple the 2.76 billion yuan a year earlier, on greater efficiencies as it upgraded its technology-driven integrated supply chain (ISC) solutions. Its non-IFRS margin rose from 1.7% in 2023 to 4.3% last year. Both the profit and margin were the company's highest since its listing in 2021.

On a quarterly basis, JD Logistics' fourth quarter revenue rose 10.4% year-on-year to 52.1 billion yuan, while its non-IFRS profit rose 23.4% to 2.2 billion yuan, improving for an eighth consecutive quarter.

“Over the past year, we have further consolidated our differentiated competitive advantages centered on ISC solutions and high-quality logistics services by continuously optimizing warehouse network deployment, advancing technological innovations, and enhancing operational efficiency,” said CEO Hu Wei on the company's earnings call.

JD Logistics said it has used its industry-specific ISC management services to help its corporate customers across a range of industries, including home appliances, furniture and apparel, to reduce costs and enhance their efficiency by optimizing inventory management, streamlining resource allocation and reducing operating costs.

Revenue from ISC customers last year reached 87.4 billion yuan. Its external ISC customer base totaled 80,703 up 8% from a year earlier.

In 2024, the company said it fully upgraded its digital supply chain technology ecosystem with its “JD Logistics Super Brain”, which integrates technologies including AI, big data, and operations research into diverse logistics processes.

At the end of last year, JD Logistics operated a network of over 100 warehouses for its international business with an aggregate gross floor area of over 1 million square meters. Its overseas warehouse network now covers 19 countries and regions.

In its global business, JD Logistics said last year it was supporting a leading Chinese new energy vehicle (NEV) brand with its China-Europe trunk line services. It also said it was supporting another automotive brand with its full cross-border services, including customs clearance, warehousing and distribution in the Middle East.

The company continued to build up its network infrastructure last year to expand its freight delivery and international express delivery services to grab a bigger share of the global e-commerce market. As part of its global build-out, it recently announced that it opened its third warehouse in Poland on Tuesday this week.

JD Logistics was the second unit of JD.com for a separate listing in 2021, raising HK$24.1 billion ($3.1 billion). It was originally set up as JD.com's in-house logistics department in 2007 and has grown since then to become one of the largest players in China's ISC logistics services industry.
