Governor Tiff Macklem warns the economic impact of Trump's trade war could be severe

The Bank of Canada cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday, citing trade uncertainty with the U.S. for the decision.

“In recent months, the pervasive uncertainty created by continuously changing U.S. tariff threats has shaken business and consumer confidence,” said Bank of Canada governor Tiff Macklem, during opening remarks in Ottawa. “This is restraining household spending intentions and businesses' plans to hire and invest.”

The decision to cut for the seventh consecutive time on Wednesday was largely expected by markets and economists and brings the central bank's overnight rate down to 2.75 per cent, in the middle of the bank's estimated neutral range.

“Depending on the extent and duration of new U.S. tariffs, the economic impact could be severe,” said Macklem.



The central bank estimates a protracted trade war could knock three per cent off Canada's growth over the next two years. The bank also estimates investment in Canada could decline by 12 per cent and exports could decrease by 8.5 per cent after the first year.

Macklem added that the “uncertainty alone is already causing harm.”

The central bank also published the results of surveys with businesses and consumers on Wednesday, which show how business and household spending sentiment has shifted.

Around 72 per cent of consumers expect costs to go up as a result of tariffs and 47 per cent of businesses think the same, according to a survey conducted between Jan. 29 and Feb. 28.



Around 48 per cent of businesses surveyed plan to reduce their investment plans and 40 per cent plan to pull back on hiring, with just two per cent of businesses saying they will increase investment.

Macklem said he expects some rise in the unemployment rate, if business investment continues to weaken in the second quarter of this year.

“Our surveys also suggest business intentions to raise prices have increased as they cope with higher costs related to both uncertainty and tariffs,” said Macklem. “At the same time, inflation expectations have moved up as Canadians brace for the possibility of higher prices.”

The bank expects inflation to rise to 2.5 per cent in March, after the end of the GST/HST federal tax break.

Macklem said the impact of tariffs on inflation will be more difficult to assess and will include a number of factors such as a weakening Canadian dollar, the cost of retaliatory tariffs and a pullback in household spending and business confidence.

The central bank said it will continue to monitor inflation expectations closely and how quickly costs incurred by businesses are being passed through to prices.

“The reality is that some prices are going to go up, we can't change that,” said Macklem. “What we don't want to see … that first round of price increases have knock-on effects causing other prices to go up, that becoming generalized and ongoing inflation. That's what we can't let happen.”

The bank said it will not be able to provide forward guidance given the uncertainty, a decision made during the last announcement in January. It also said the governing council will be “carefully assessing the timing and strength” of downward pressures on inflation from weaker growth and upward pressures on inflation from higher costs.

Randall Bartlett, deputy chief economist at Desjardins Group, said the market reaction following the announcement on Wednesday suggests an April cut is “no slam dunk.”

Tony Stillo and Michael Davenport, economists at Oxford Economics Canada, think the Bank of Canada could cut its policy rate a few more times this year, but will not go below the neutral range.

“We can't entirely rule out a couple more 25-basis-points rate cuts to cushion against the negative impacts of ongoing uncertainty, but we think it's very unlikely the bank will lower rates below the bottom-end of its 2.25 per cent-3.25 per cent neutral range estimate given the ongoing U.S.-Canada trade war,” they wrote in a note.

The Bank of Canada has cut its overnight lending rate by 25 basis points to 2.75 per cent, it announced on Wednesday, as an ongoing trade war with the U.S. begins to strain the Canadian economy.

Explaining the decision in his opening remarks, Bank of Canada governor Tiff Macklem said the economy started the year strong, with solid GDP growth and inflation within its two per cent target.

But tariff uncertainty caused by the on-again, off-again trade war between Canada and the U.S. has weighed on business spending and hiring, and shaken consumer confidence, he said. Manufacturing businesses in particular have lowered their sales outlooks.

It's "against this backdrop" that the central bank decided to cut the rate by a quarter point, according to Macklem, though he added that a surge in exports ahead of the tariffs might offset a slowdown in growth.

"While it is still too early to see much impact of new tariffs on economic activity, our surveys suggest that threats of new tariffs and uncertainty about the Canada-U.S. trade relationship are already having a big impact on business and consumer intentions," he said during his Wednesday news conference.

Bank of Canada cuts key rate, cites 'pervasive uncertainty' of U.S. tariff threats

It's the seventh consecutive cut the Bank has made since it started bringing rates down in June 2024.

"They're clearly worried that an economy that was otherwise in pretty good shape and wouldn't have needed a rate cut now needs this one, and perhaps more, given the potential shock from higher tariffs and what that's going to do to the Canadian economy in the near term," said Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC.

The bank's internal research shows that Canadian businesses intend to raise prices to offset the impact of tariffs. As Macklem noted, less spending by businesses and consumers tends to put downward pressure on inflation. But rising costs could trigger it.

"We're now facing a new crisis. Depending on the extent and duration of new U.S. tariffs, the economic impact could be severe. The uncertainty alone is already causing harm," he said on Wednesday.

Macklem has warned in the past that the bank cannot shield the Canadian economy from the financial impact of tariffs, but that it can instead use interest rates to manage a potential surge in inflation.

Tiff Macklem outlines what tariffs could mean for inflation in Canada

Meanwhile, the bank's preferred measures of core inflation are still above two per cent, mainly driven by housing-related price growth, adding to its concerns.

Asked what kind of inflationary impacts Canada faces, Macklem said during the Q&A with reporters that "given the pervasive uncertainty and unpredictability of U.S. trade policy, I can't put a number on it."

Several factors could contribute to inflation, he said. The weak Canadian dollar poses a challenge to importers, because it means the products they bring in will be more expensive; retaliatory tariffs imposed by Canada will also add costs; and uncertainty itself adds costs, because businesses are looking for new suppliers and new markets to sustain themselves.

"Somebody has to pay for these costs and, ultimately, they get passed to the consumer," he explained. "What we can do is ensure that any rise in inflation is temporary." 

As one reporter pointed out, Macklem never used the word recession in his remarks, which some economists have said is a likely outcome given that tariffs will hamper growth.

As for whether a recession is imminent, deputy governor Carolyn Rogers said the bank doesn't have a forecast at this point. "All of those things don't bode well for growth, but we'll see," she said.

The Bank of Canada's next interest rate meeting is on April 16, at which point it will also release its quarterly monetary policy report to assess the outlook for the Canadian economy.

BMO chief economist Douglas Porter wrote in a note to clients that any future interest rate decisions "will be largely guided by the direction of travel in the trade war, although we suspect the Bank was headed a bit lower in any event."

"Our core assumption is that Canada will be facing some serious tariffs for an extended period of time and that the growth dampening aspects of the trade war will ultimately outweigh the upside inflationary impact, keeping the Bank in easing mode," Porter wrote.

He expects the Bank will make a 25 basis point cut at each of its next three meetings, bringing the overnight lending rate to two per cent.

The Federal Trade Commission asked a judge in Seattle to delay the start of its trial accusing Amazon of duping consumers into signing up for its Prime program, citing resource constraints.

Attorneys for the FTC made the request during a status hearing on Wednesday before Judge John Chun in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. Chun had set a Sept. 22 start date for the trial.

Jonathan Cohen, an attorney for the FTC, asked Chun for a two-month continuance on the case due to staffing and budgetary shortfalls.

The FTC's request comes amid a push by the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency to reduce spending. DOGE, which is led by tech baron Elon Musk, has slashed the federal government's workforce by more than 62,000 workers in February alone.

"We have lost employees in the agency, in our division and on our case team," Cohen said.

Chun asked Cohen how the FTC's situation "will be different in two months" if the agency is "in crisis now, as far as resources." Cohen responded by saying that he "cannot guarantee if things won't be even worse." He pointed to the possibility that the FTC may have to move to another office "unexpectedly," which could hamper its ability to prepare for the trial.

"But there's a lot of reason to believe ... we may have been through the brunt of it, at least for a little while," Cohen said.

John Hueston, an attorney for Amazon, disputed Cohen's request to push back the trial date.

"There has been no showing on this call that the government does not have the resources to proceed to trial with the trial date as presently set," Hueston said. "What I heard is that they've got the whole trial team still intact. Maybe there's going to be an office move. And by the way, both in government and private sector, I've never heard of an office move being more than a few days disruptive."

The FTC sued Amazon in June 2023, alleging that the online retailer was deceiving millions of customers into signing up for its Prime program and sabotaging their attempts to cancel it. Amazon has denied any wrongdoing, calling the FTC's claims "wrong on the facts and the law."

"Amazon tricked and trapped people into recurring subscriptions without their consent, not only frustrating users but also costing them significant money," former FTC Chair Lina Khan said at the time.

The FTC brought a separate case against Amazon in September 2023 accusing it of wielding an illegal monopoly. The agency alleged that Amazon prevents sellers from offering cheaper prices elsewhere through its anti-discounting measures. That case is set to go to trial in October 2026.

In the time since the FTC filed its cases, Khan has been replaced as the head of the FTC by Trump appointee Andrew Ferguson. Tech companies, which are the target of several regulatory agencies, have sought to curry favor with Trump, including Amazon founder and executive chairman Jeff Bezos. He attended President Donald Trump's inauguration in January, and Amazon was among several tech companies to donate $1 million to Trump's inauguration committee.

Verizon Business takes first-of-its-kind approach to network-native security for business with end-to-end solution that can be embedded in customer networks

NEW YORK — Businesses of all sizes can now bolster cybersecurity along the complete digital pathway from their connected devices through their IT networks all the way to cloud-hosted SaaS applications with Trusted Connection, a new cybersecurity solution from Verizon Business. Instead of simply forming a secure perimeter around your digital landscape, Trusted Connection secures the connection and endpoints from any user device to any digital resource, spanning web/cloud, SaaS, private apps and more.

Trusted Connection is particularly suitable for larger midsize businesses that need enhanced security but don't have the resources or dedicated expertise to install and run it themselves, or for enterprises looking to simplify the management of their security.

“Having the right cybersecurity architecture in place is one of the most important responsibilities technology decision-makers face. Ensuring end-to-end security is critical,” said Kyle Malady, CEO, Verizon Business. “If a perimeter is breached, bad actors can wreak havoc. Trusted Connection creates a protected environment within the outer walls of security, protecting each specific entry point and pathway that could lead a bad actor to a valuable digital asset. It's sophisticated security technology combined with an ease of use that makes cybersecurity accessible to businesses of all sizes.”

“Cloud-related security is an urgent and escalating problem, but few enterprises have the resources to keep safe in real time as exploitable technologies gain ground. The service can dramatically reduce attack surface by encrypting paths between cloud and endpoint.” said Camille Mendler, Chief Analyst, Service Provider Enterprise, Omdia. “Trusted Connection's seamless network-native security offers a huge step forward in functionality and control -- especially for mid-sized companies that face similar threats as large enterprises but often lack the resources to address quickly evolving security threats comprehensively.”

According to the 2024 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report, 77% of basic web application attacks and 31% of all breaches in the past 10 years involved the use of stolen credentials. Trusted Connection can help contain the negative impacts of stolen credentials by enforcing ZTNA on network connections, checking device security posture, providing access from a managed device and by enforcing multi-factor authentication on access as designated by administrators.

The Trump administration raised tariffs on global steel and aluminum imports to 25% Wednesday as President Donald Trump and his administration dig in on trade policies that have rocked financial markets.

Allies of the U.S., such as the European Union, responded in kind with a hail of criticism and reciprocal tariffs. The EU announced retaliatory tariffs early Wednesday on $28 billion-worth of a wide range of U.S. goods imported to Europe such as boats, motorbikes and alcohol. 

President Trump announced the tariffs last month and the White House said Wednesday that there would be no exceptions. 

“President Trump has once again used the leverage of the American economy, which is the best and biggest in the world, to deliver a win for the American people,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement.

Calling the new U.S. tariffs “unjustified,” the European Commission said that the levies would kick in on April 1, with additional countermeasures introduced in mid-April. 

Investors appeared unfazed as they sent U.S. stock futures higher in advance of the release of the latest Consumer Price Index report Wednesday, though major stock indexes remain sharply lower in recent weeks. The S&P 500 is down almost 9% from its February high, putting it in correction territory.

While President Trump has suggested he wants to negotiate a broader trade agreement with the U.K., Britain did not escape the taxes. U.K. business and trade secretary Jonathan Reynolds called the levies “disappointing,” but said his country was “focused on a pragmatic approach” and negotiating a broader deal.

The European reaction echoed that of Canada, another of America's traditional close allies and trading partners, on which Trump had already imposed a 25% metals tax.

New tariffs were briefly expected to go even higher for Canada, the top U.S. export market. President Donald Trump said Tuesday they would jump to 50% in response to Ontario Premier Doug Ford's threat to impose a 25% surcharge on electricity imports into the United States to match the initial U.S. hike.

A conversation between Ford and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, prevented this though, with Trump indicating a doubling of U.S. tariffs for Canada was no longer likely.

In a joint-statement with Lutnick posted on X, Ford said they would meet Thursday alongside the U.S. trade representative to discuss renewing the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade act.

In a Truth Social post Monday, Trump called Canada a longtime “tariff abuser,” going beyond his metals threats to say that “The United States is not going to be subsidizing Canada any longer,” and that “We don't need your Cars, we don't need your Lumber, we don't your Energy, and very soon, you will find that out.”

Other long-time U.S. allies also failed to escape. 

Australia, which had been hoping for the same exemption from steel and aluminum tariffs it received during the first Trump administration, said it would not retaliate.

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the tariff “entirely unjustified,” but added that imposing reciprocal tariffs “would only push up prices for Australian consumers,” and that Australia would impose no new tariffs on U.S. goods.

Perhaps the sharpest response came from China, the world's largest steel producer and second-largest economy, which had already been slapped with a 20% blanket tariff on Trump's return to office, and announced new tariffs in return. 

Beijing's foreign ministry accused the U.S. of violating World Trade Organization rules and said it would take “all necessary measures” to protect its rights and interests. 

“No one wins in a trade war or a tariff war, a view widely shared by the international community,” spokesperson Mao Ning said at a media briefing.

America's Asian allies in South Korea and Japan — both are major steel producers — were also hit. 

South Korea, which Trump singled out in his address to Congress last week over its tariff policies, is scrambling to minimize the impact of U.S. tariffs on its domestic industries. Trade Minister Cheong In-kyo's office said Wednesday he will be in Washington for two days starting Thursday for tariff discussions.

Yoshimasa Hayashi, the Japanese government's top spokesperson, told reporters in Tokyo it was “regrettable” that the new U.S. tariffs had been imposed “without excluding Japan.”

Stock market investors have made their feelings about the tariffs clear, with major indexes plunging on Trump's earlier tariff threats, before rallying on the suspension announcement for Canada.

Pre-market futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq all inched higher early Wednesday after plunging in recent days. 

Aside from steel and aluminum, Trump on Tuesday called on Canada to drop its duties on U.S. dairy products and threatened to "substantially increase" tariffs on cars imported into the United States if Canada did not drop "other egregious, long time tariffs."

The auto tariffs, Trump warned, without citing evidence, “essentially, permanently shut down the automobile manufacturing business in Canada.” He also doubled down on some of his recent rhetoric about making Canada part of the United States.

Canada has quickly emerged as a target of Trump's ire in his second term. Trump this month instituted, then pulled back, tariffs on a variety of Canadian goods as he goaded its leaders and blamed them for a lack of action on fentanyl trafficking. 

Relatively little of the drug is seized at the U.S.'s northern border compared with that with Mexico.

While Mexico has faced similar tariff threats and rhetoric, its president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has succeeded in assuaging Trump.

Newly appointed Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney subsequently called Trump's threats "an attack on Canadian workers, families and businesses."

He said Canadian tariffs on U.S. goods would remain "until the Americans show us respect and make credible, reliable commitments to free and fair trade."

Morgan Stanley analysts warned that because the United States is a net importer of steel and aluminum from Canada, the tariffs would lead to higher domestic prices.

The union positioned the two sides as being "frustratingly far apart" at the negotiating table in an update to members on Tuesday.


							By 

	Katie Kilkenny


Labor & Media Reporter


SAG-AFTRA has been on strike against major video game studios for more than seven months, and the two sides don't seem to be particularly close to making a deal.


	That's the impression that negotiators for the performers union gave to members in a message on Tuesday that warned that the companies' latest proposals contained “alarming loopholes that will leave our members vulnerable to AI abuse” — the very issue that prompted the union's current work stoppage in the first place.




	The memo, which contained a link to a chart showing the alleged gap between the union's and the employer's recent proposals on AI, claimed that the labor group is “frustratingly far apart” in its proposals from the video game studios, though the message said the studios might claim otherwise.

	A spokesperson for the companies that are negotiating the Interactive Media Agreement with the union stated that their deal proposal contains “wage increases of over 15% for SAG-AFTRA represented performers in video games, as well as enhanced health and safety protections, industry-leading terms of use for AI digital replicas in-game and additional compensation for the use of an actor's performance in other games.” The spokesperson added that the two sides have made “meaningful progress” and the companies are eager to return to the bargaining table.

	The firms currently in negotiations with SAG-AFTRA include Disney Character Voices, Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Warner Bros. Games, Insomniac Games and others. In October, that bargaining group stated that the two sides had reached tentative agreements on “24 out of 25 proposals.” 


	Nevertheless, SAG-AFTRA national executive director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland and Interactive Media negotiating chair Sarah Elmaleh wrote to members on Tuesday that the employers' last proposals would allow studios to use union members' past performances and outside performances “without any of the protections being bargained at all.” The negotiators also alleged that the studios' proposals would not require them to disclose how they used a digital replica after a performer has given their consent for how it can be used.


	With its chart, the union showed that it is attempting to negotiate specific AI language — provisions, for instance, that end performers' consent for use of their digital replica during a strike, that require additional reports from the studios regarding their use of digital replicas and that necessitate employer disclosure of whether a performer's voice will be combined with any other voices in a digital replica or whether it will be used for any kind of generative AI chatbot.

	











	The chart also demonstrates that the two parties have reached provisional deals on some issues: They have agreed to mandating that actors give their consent for digital replicas made using their performances and agreed on the amount of information that performers will receive about how their digital replicas are intended to be used in employment contracts. The labor and employer sides have also   been in accord on certain ways that performers can be compensated for their digital replicas, but have not resolved all their differences on payment.


	In its Tuesday message, the union also implored performers who don't usually work in video games to reject any jobs offered by struck companies. “If you're approached for such a role, we urge you to seriously consider the consequences. Not only would you be undermining the efforts of your fellow members, but you would be putting yourself at risk by working without protections against A.I. misuse,” the negotiators wrote.


	Nearly two years into their long-running negotiations with video game studios, SAG-AFTRA called a strike against those companies in July 2024. Negotiations have taken place in starts and stops ever since, with union performers occasionally picketing struck companies. The labor group's latest demonstration, at Disney Character Voices in Burbank, will take place on March 18.

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says U.S. tariffs on Australian steel and aluminum are unjustified, but his government will not retaliate with its own tariffs

Australia Won't Retaliate Against 'Unjustified' US Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum

MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Wednesday that U.S. tariffs on Australian steel and aluminum were unjustified, but his government would not retaliate with its own tariffs.

U.S. President Donald Trump said last month he was considering a tariff exemption for Australia, a free trade treaty partner that has traded with the United States at a deficit for decades.

A former Australian government secured an exemption with the previous Trump administration in 2018 based on arguments including that Australian steelmaker BlueScope employs thousands of workers in the U.S.

Albanese said he would continue to pursue an Australian exemption. The 2018 exemption took several months to secure.

“It has been foreshadowed that no country regardless of its relationship with the United States has been granted an exemption. Such a decision by the Trump administration is entirely unjustified,” Albanese said.

“Tariffs and escalating trade tensions are a form of economic self-harm and a recipe for slower growth and higher inflation. They are paid by the consumers. This is why Australia will not be imposing reciprocal tariffs on the United States,” Albanese added.

The U.S. officially increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25% on Wednesday.

The U.S. decision not to exempt Australia was announced days after a spat became public between Trump and the former Australian prime minister who secured the 2018 exemption, Malcolm Turnbull.

Trump described Turnbull, who quit politics in 2018 after being overthrown as prime minister by his own government, as a weak and ineffective leader.

“Malcolm Turnbull, the former Prime Minister of Australia who was always leading that wonderful country from 'behind', never understood what was going on in China, nor did he have the capacity to do so,” Trump wrote on social media.

READ:  

“I always thought he was a weak and ineffective leader and, obviously, Australian's (sic) agreed with me!!!” Trump added.

Trump was responding to an interview Turnbull gave this week to U.S. media company Bloomberg in which the former Australian leader said Chinese President Xi Jinping would take advantage of the U.S. president's chaotic and erratic leadership.

“I think China will take advantage, massive advantage of Trump,” Turnbull told Bloomberg.

“What my prediction will be that President Xi will aim to be the exact opposite of Trump. Where Trump is chaotic, he will be consistent. Where Trump is rude and abusive, he'll be respectful. Where Trump is erratic, he will be consistent,” Turnbull said.

“And what that will do is build trust with countries, and there'll be many countries who will, you know, looking at China on the one hand and Trump on the other, will find China a more attractive partner,” Turnbull added.

Greenland's pro-business opposition Demokraatit party won Tuesday's closely watched parliamentary election, beating the incumbent left-wing coalition in a vote dominated by U.S. President Donald Trump's pledge to take control of the island.

Demokraatit, which favours a slow approach to independence from Denmark, secured 29.9% of the votes with all ballots counted, up from 9.1% in 2021, ahead of the opposition Naleraq party, which favours rapid independence, at 24.5%.

Since taking office in January, Donald Trump has vowed to make Greenland - a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark – part of the United States, saying it is vital to U.S. security interests, an idea rejected by most Greenlanders.

The vast island, with a population of just 57,000, has been caught up in a geopolitical race for dominance in the Arctic, where melting ice caps are making its resources more accessible and opening new shipping routes. Both Russia and China have intensified military activity in the region.

"People want change ... We want more business to finance our welfare," said Jens-Frederik Nielsen, Demokraatit's leader and a former minister of industry and minerals. "We don't want independence tomorrow, we want a good foundation," Nielsen told reporters in Nuuk.

He will now hold talks with other parties to try and form a governing coalition. The ruling Inuit Ataqatigiit party and its partner Siumut, which also seek a slow path towards independence, won a combined 36% of votes, down from 66.1% in 2021.

"We respect the election outcome," Prime Minister Mute Egede of the Inuit Ataqatigiit said in a Facebook post, adding that he would listen to any proposals in upcoming coalition talks. Greenland is a former Danish colony and has been a territory since 1953. It gained some autonomy in 1979 when its first parliament was formed, but Copenhagen still controls foreign affairs, defense and monetary policy and provides just under $1 billion a year to the economy.

In 2009, it won the right to declare full independence through a referendum, even though it has not done so out of concern living standards would drop without Denmark's economic support.

"I strongly believe that we will very soon start to live a life more based on who we are, based on our culture, based on our own language, and start to make regulations based on us, not based on Denmark," said Qupanuk Olsen, candidate for the main pro-independence party Naleraq.

Inge Olsvig Brandt, a candidate for the ruling Inuit Ataqatigiit party, said: "We don't need the independence right now. We have too many things to work on. I think we have to work with ourselves, our history, and we are going to have a lot of healing work with us before we can take the next step."

Voting had been extended by half an hour at some of the 72 polling stations across the Arctic island, where some 40,500 people were eligible to cast their ballot, although the final turnout was not immediately available.

Inuit pride

Trump's vocal interest has shaken up the status quo, and coupled with the growing pride of the Indigenous people in their Inuit culture, put independence front and center in the election.

In the final debate on Greenland's state broadcaster KNR late on Monday, leaders of the five parties currently in parliament unanimously said they did not trust Trump. "He is trying to influence us. I can understand if citizens feel insecure," said Erik Jensen, leader of government coalition partner Siumut.

A January poll suggested a majority of Greenland's inhabitants support independence, but are divided on timing.

Early on, the election campaign focused on the anger and frustration aimed at historical wrongdoings by Denmark, according to Julie Rademacher, a consultant and former adviser to Greenland's government.

"But I think the fear of the U.S. imperialist approach has lately become bigger than the anger towards Denmark," said Rademacher.

Reuters spoke to more than a dozen Greenlanders in Nuuk, all of whom said they favored independence, although many expressed concern that a swift transition could damage the economy and eliminate Nordic welfare services like universal healthcare and free schooling.

"We don't want to be part of the U.S. for obvious reasons; healthcare and Trump," said Tuuta Lynge-Larsen, a bank employee and Nuuk resident, adding that this election was especially important. "We don't like the attention, to put it short."

The island holds substantial natural resources, including critical minerals such as rare earths used in high-tech industries, ranging from electric vehicles to missile systems. However, Greenland has been slow to extract them due to environmental concerns, severe weather, and China's near-total control of the sector, which has made it difficult for companies elsewhere to make a profit or secure buyers.

Investment pledges

Trump initially declined to rule out military force to take control of the territory, alarming many Greenlanders, although he later softened his stance, stating he would respect the will of the local people and was "ready to invest billions of dollars" if they joined the U.S.

Egede has stressed the island is not for sale and advocated for a broad coalition government to resist external pressure. In an interview aired on Monday by Danish broadcaster DR, he dismissed Trump's offer as disrespectful, expressing willingness to cooperate with other countries instead.

Denmark's prime minister has said Greenland is not for sale, but made it clear that it is up to the local people to decide their future. All six main political parties support independence but differ on how and when it could be achieved.

The pro-independence Naleraq party, the leading opposition force, gained momentum ahead of the election, bolstered by U.S. interest and fresh accusations of Denmark's historic exploitation of Greenland's mineral wealth.

The party believes the U.S. attention strengthens Greenland's position in secession talks with Denmark and aims to bring a deal with Copenhagen to a vote before the next election in four years.
