                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Adding to Bitcoin's typical bull momentum from lower rates is the perception that it serves as a hedge against government dysfunction,” he continued. Brett Sifling, wealth manager for Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, also weighed in on bitcoin's current situation, emphasizing through emailed comments that “There are a few reasons why I think it's building momentum.” “Most recently, softer than expected U.S. jobs data (ADP numbers) has been connected to raising the odds of an October Fed rate cut,” he noted. “Lower rates means that risk-on assets like Bitcoin will generally be viewed favorably by market participants.” “We're also entering October, which in the crypto community is called, ‘Uptober' as it's been a seasonably favorable month for Bitcoin throughout its history,” he added. “Given all these positives, along with the government shutdown, it makes sense to me that Bitcoin would be catching a bid and making new highs,” Sifling concluded. One analyst in particular claimed that a range of bullish variables have been driving bitcoin's latest gains. “Strong inflows into spot ETFs and institutional demand are providing steady buying pressure, while expectations of Fed easing have boosted appetite for risk assets,” he added. “With momentum traders piling in as Bitcoin nears its prior all-time high, the rally has become self-reinforcing.” “This price upward movement has been mostly supported by a relatively higher investor demand in the US, as seen by an increasing Bitcoin price premium on Coinbase, which is at the highest level since June 7,” he said via Telegram. “US investor demand is what typically drives Bitcoin price rallies during bull markets,” added Moreno. Tim Enneking, managing partner of Psalion, offered his two cents on bitcoin's current situation, emphasizing how much it stands out. “Given such a supply-and-demand dynamic, the price really only has one direction to go.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The charter would allow Coinbase to build on its existing custody business by offering services such as payments and settlement, without seeking a charter as a full-service bank. "Coinbase has no intention of becoming a bank," Greg Tusar, vice president of institutional product at Coinbase, said in a blog post. Today, the U.S. crypto exchange's main regulated custody service is run through Coinbase Custody Trust Company (CCTC), which is licensed under New York state's BitLicense regime. A federal trust charter would give the company more flexibility to launch new financial services such as crypto payments without needing state-by-state approvals. Coinbase's move follows a slew of crypto companies, including Circle, Ripple and Paxos, applying for federal supervision this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Six XRP ETF filings are due Oct. 18–25; we trace the paperwork and model flows, liquidity, and price impact. Six spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) await SEC approval in the US, with final deadlines for October, and they can reshape market conditions following their debut. The regulatory backdrop underwent a significant change on Sept. 17, when the SEC approved generic listing standards for crypto-related ETFs across major exchanges. As a result, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted on Sept. 29 that approvals on altcoin ETFs are not a matter of “if,” but “when.” Once staff return, effectiveness orders can be reassessed, meaning an October approval is still plausible. The regulatory backdrop suggests that Bitwise, 21Shares, WisdomTree, Canary Capital, CoinShares, and Grayscale will launch their XRP products on Cboe this month. How much money could flow is a live debate, but several guideposts exist. Market researchers suggested as much as $8 billion in first-year inflows, with CryptoQuant's Julio Moreno estimating ETFs could absorb 1% to 4% of circulating supply. JPMorgan's January framework, extrapolated from Bitcoin and Ethereum penetration, projected 3% to 6% of market cap converted into inflows. XRP traded at $3.05 as of press time, which implies roughly $5.5 billion to $11 billion in year-one net creations. In the battle to capture capital flows in this billion-dollar market, fee competition and distribution strategies are crucial. Lower expense ratios and broad brokerage access historically correlate with stronger early flows. Regarding investor positioning, retail investors are likely to dominate the first-year inflows if XRP is to replicate the movements of spot Bitcoin ETFs. A K33 February research highlighted that 25.4% of spot Bitcoin ETF assets under management are held by institutions. In a larger timeframe, Bitcoin quickly climbed to a local top of nearly $74,000 two months later, while Ethereum continued to nosedive until early October. However, Bitcoin's movement occurred in a bullish environment for the entire market, while the Ethereum ETF aftermath took place during a significant correction period. As a result, it is challenging to predict XRP's price action, although a sell-the-news event is likely to happen, considering past events. Glassnode documented how US spot ETFs have become a structural “supply absorber” for Bitcoin and Ethereum on their weekly reports. Conversely, when flows resume, drawdowns stabilize as supply tightens. An XRP complex would likely replicate that cadence, with steady creations capturing inventory inside funds, shifting price discovery toward the pace of advisor and retail allocations, and reducing sensitivity to purely crypto-native liquidity cycles.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The plaintiffs failed to show how Bored Ape Yacht Club and other NFTs represent investment contracts under the SEC's 3-pronged Howey Test. A US judge has dismissed an investor lawsuit against Web3 company Yuga Labs, ruling that the case failed to show non-fungible tokens (NFTs) meet the legal definition of securities.Judge Fernando M. Olguin ruled the plaintiffs did not demonstrate how Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), ApeCoin (APE) or other NFTs sold by Yuga satisfied the three conditions of the Howey test, a standard used by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to determine whether a transaction qualifies as an investment contract. Yuba Labs marketed its NFTs as digital collectibles with membership perks to an exclusive club, making them consumables rather than investment contracts, Olguin said. Related: NFTs ‘heating up' as nightclubs, rappers jump back on bandwagon The NFTs, which trade on public blockchain networks, did not establish an ongoing and dependent financial link between the purchaser and Yuga Labs, and do not qualify as a “common enterprise” under the Howey Test, Olguin said. Investors who purchased NFTs from the company paid a fee to Yuga that was independent of the NFT prices, Consensys attorney Bill Hughes wrote on X. “Statements about NFT prices and trade volumes are a somewhat closer call, but even then, these statements by themselves fail to establish an expectation of profit,” he added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new law allows for people who have been the victim of a scam involving the use of virtual currency kiosks — often referred to as Bitcoin ATMs — to receive a full refund of their money, and one law enforcement agency reports it's already putting the law to use. Rogers police sent out a news release Thursday about Act 557 of 2025, which allows people get their money back from the kiosks if people follow the proper procedures. According to the Federal Trade Commission, Bitcoin ATMs are machines that look like a traditional ATM and are often found at convenience stores, gas stations and other high-traffic areas. Data from the commission show from 2020 to 2023, consumers lost more than $110 million in scams involving Bitcoin ATMs. Don Lisi, Rogers Police Department spokesman, said police investigate cases involving virtual currency scams on a regular basis, and the department is currently handling a couple of such cases. “(2) files a report with a government or law enforcement agency memorializing the fraudulent nature of the virtual currency transaction.” The law took effect Aug. 5, and Rogers police detectives have already begun assisting victims of virtual kiosk scams in getting their money refunded, according to Thursday's release. Detectives will not be able to assist people with previous cases since the law is not retroactive, the release states. “If you think it is a scam, please hang up or stop communicating with them and contact law enforcement. If someone contacts you claiming to be a law enforcement officer and is asking for some sort of payment, that is a scam. Law enforcement officers will never attempt to collect money from you for any reason.” The Arizona Cryptocurrency Kiosk License Fraud Prevention law took effect Sept. 26, according to a news release from Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes. The law lowers daily transaction minimums, increases warnings on the kiosks, requires transaction receipts and requires Bitcoin ATM operators to issue refunds to victims of fraud, the release states. “I'm glad we can implement commonsense protections to prevent even more Arizonans from becoming victims of cryptocurrency ATM fraud,” Mayes said. “Last year, Arizonans lost an astounding $177 million in their hard-earned savings to cryptocurrency scammers. This is a good first step, but we need to do even more to protect Arizona seniors from these persistent criminals.” J.B. Pritzker signed the Digital Asset Kiosk Act into law Aug. 18, according to a news release from the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation. The act requires virtual currency kiosk operators to register with the Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, provide reports detailing all kiosk locations, and provide full refunds to new customers who are victims of scams at kiosks. It requires operators of virtual currency kiosks to issue refunds to Iowans for fraudulent transactions processed through the machines as long as certain steps are followed within 90 days of the transaction. A lawsuit was filed in April against the Benton County Sheriff's Office after deputies seized $14,120 from a virtual currency kiosk when a person claimed to have been scammed. The user purchased Bitcoin for $14,120 in two separate transactions, and the Bitcoin was sent to a digital wallet, according to court documents. Cryptocurrency is stored in a digital wallet, which can be online, on a computer or on an external hard drive, according to the Federal Trade Commission. He reported he'd received a call from someone who claimed to be a deputy from the Benton County Sheriff's Office and there was a warrant out for his arrest for failure to appear for jury duty, according to the complaint. The seven Benton County circuit judges recused from the case, and it has been assigned to Jim Spears, a retired circuit judge. The Arkansas Attorney General's Office issued a news release in April that cryptocurrency kiosk scams are on the rise in Arkansas. Arkansans who wish to report concerns about potential cryptocurrency kiosk scams should contact the attorney general by calling (800) 482-8982, emailing [email protected] or by visiting arkansasag.gov/file-a-complaint. How do these scams work, and what are the dangers? Often, they create a sense of urgency by stating an account has been compromised or a person owes the government back taxes or missed court and owe several thousand dollars. Scammers may even send someone documents that look official or "spoof" a legitimate organization, meaning the caller ID will show an organization's name. Payments through kiosks are quick and immediate. Transactions cannot be reversed and are often untraceable. No legitimate business will demand advance payment through a Bitcoin ATM. No government organization will contact someone via text message to pay a bill or ask for payments through a Bitcoin ATM. People should not pay anyone who contacts them with cryptocurrency, wire transfers or gift cards. If contacted about cryptocurrency, people should hang up and try calling the institution back (such as the sheriff's office, utility company or bank) through a known number. People should never provide personal information to anyone they do not know. Instead, they should contact a trusted relative or friend and ask for advice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Blazpay ($BLAZ) has officially launched its presale, with Phase 1 now live at the entry price of just $0.006 per token. The big question remains: can Blazpay really deliver on these ambitious targets? Unlike many early stage projects that launch with just a concept, Blazpay has visible traction to build upon. In addition to these milestones, Blazpay has introduced real utilities that drive user engagement. Its BlazPoints rewards system incentivizes platform activity with gamified on chain benefits, while BlazThreads encourages users to create educational content and share knowledge about DeFi. These utilities highlight that Blazpay is building more than hype. It is creating an ecosystem designed for growth, education, and participation, which makes its presale feel less speculative and more about scaling what is already working. Starting at just $0.006 per token, the potential upside is enormous: Few projects combine such a low entry with the possibility of scaling into double digits. Joining the Blazpay presale is simple, and early entry is key to securing the lowest price before tokens rise in Phase 2. Most presale projects launch with promises but little more than a roadmap. Buyers are often left waiting for months before they see working products. It is entering the market as a DeFi platform that unifies trading, staking, bridging, and portfolio management into one secure hub. Adding to this is BlazAI, the built-in AI execution layer. Instead of navigating complicated menus, participants can type commands like “stake 500 tokens” or “bridge USDT to Ethereum.” BlazAI handles the process instantly across more than 20 supported blockchains, optimizing for speed, cost, and accuracy. By combining a one-stop ecosystem with AI-powered simplicity, Blazpay is more than another ico presale. If targets of $1, $5, or $10 are ever reached, early buyers who joined in Phase 1 could see massive returns. With limited tokens available and the next price increase set for just 14 days away, Blazpay's presale is offering a rare early access opportunity in 2025. Join Phase 1 now at Blazpay.com and secure your tokens before the next price increase. Disclaimer: This is a paid post and should not be treated as news/advice.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coinbase Applies for US Banking License, Joining Growing Pack of Crypto Firms If approved, Coinbase said it would be able to faster offer products and services, and further innovate "to integrate digital assets into traditional finance," the company said. The license allows companies—that aren't banks—to oversee their own reserves and take custody of assets for institutions. "Coinbase has no intention of becoming a bank," the exchange said. "If approved, the charter would continue to open up opportunities for Coinbase to launch new products beyond custody, including payments and related services, with the confidence of regulatory clarity, fostering broader institutional adoption," the company added. This year, Circle, which issues the USDC stablecoin, and Paxos, which issues tokens PYUSD and PAXG, applied for the license. RLUSD stablecoin issuer Ripple has also applied for a charter. San Francisco, California-based Coinbase is pushing deeper into the traditional finance world. In July, it signed a deal with JPMorganChase, aiming to allow customers to buy crypto quicker and easier than before. Coinbase went public in 2021 and has a contract with the U.S. Editor's note: This story was updated after publication with additional details.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Ethereum Foundation said Friday it will swap 1,000 ETH (approximately $4.5 million) for stablecoins to fund growth. Using CoWSwap's TWAP feature, the organization said converting the ether into stablecoins will help it fuel "ongoing work to fund R&D, grants and donations, and to highlight the power of DeFi," according to a post to social media platform X. Last month, the Ethereum Foundation made a similar announcement, saying it would convert 10,000 ether (worth $43.6 million at the time) to stablecoins on centralized exchanges, framed as routine funding for research, grants, and donations. Some urged the Ethereum Foundation to either borrow against its ETH using DeFi-native lending platforms or engage in over-the-counter deals with digital asset treasuries. On Friday, the Ethereum Foundation pointed to its treasury policy from last June, outlining how it prefers to manage its funds. "To achieve its objectives, EF will maintain and periodically refine an asset-liability management policy and a high-level grant allocation strategy," the blog post said. "EF will manage its assets, considering risk, duration, and liquidity, while remaining aligned with Ethereum's core principles."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aerospace companies are stepping up their game by harnessing blockchain technology for a whole new level of efficiency. Imagine being able to trace every single part, from raw materials to the final product, on an unchangeable ledger. In this post, I want to dive into how blockchain is enhancing traceability, fighting counterfeit risks, and optimizing logistics. Plus, we'll look at the promise of crypto payments in aerospace, and the regulatory hurdles that lie ahead. With blockchain, aerospace companies can track every transaction and process related to components, including the all-important material testing results and quality assurance data. This creates a tamper-proof "digital birth certificate" for each part, ensuring authenticity and compliance with regulatory requirements. The use of blockchain payments can also speed up the procurement processes for materials, allowing for quicker transactions and better cash flow management. This is especially crucial in an industry where high-value components require meticulous tracking. The aerospace supply chain is a tangled web, involving numerous players from suppliers to manufacturers. Blockchain can enhance supply chain visibility, offering a decentralized ledger to all parties involved. This increased transparency can minimize inconsistencies, improve coordination, and allow real-time tracking of parts. Allowing direct transactions between suppliers and manufacturers can cut down on the administrative mess and errors that come with traditional payment methods. With the rise of B2B crypto payment platforms tailored for aerospace, operational efficiency could see a significant boost. The potential for cryptocurrency payments in aerospace testing and services is becoming increasingly clear. The recent move by Emirates to accept crypto payments for flights is a sign that the aerospace sector won't be far behind. This could streamline the purchasing process for aircraft spare parts and maintenance services, improving both operational efficiency and data handling. This not only makes transactions easier but also aligns with the industry's need for compliance. The aerospace sector is highly regulated, with strict safety, maintenance, and operational standards. The unchangeable nature of blockchain can clash with regulations like GDPR, so companies will need to find a way to balance transparency with the need to protect sensitive information. This means having a solid strategy for managing crypto assets, ensuring compliance, and putting risk management protocols in place to handle volatility. Using a crypto treasury API can also help automate compliance checks and optimize financial operations. By doing this, aerospace companies can keep pace with innovation in the industry. Enhanced material testing, better supply chain management, and seamless payments could lead to greater efficiency and reduced costs. Embracing these technologies could be the key to staying ahead in an increasingly digital world. OneSafe brings together your crypto and banking needs in one simple, powerful platform.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leo Schwartz is a senior writer at Fortune covering fintech, crypto, venture capital, and financial regulation. Fall may finally be here, but any impending Crypto Winter still seems far away. On Friday, Bitcoin continued its five-day rally to near $124,000, mere hundreds of dollars from an all-time high that the leading cryptocurrency notched in mid-August. And for longtime crypto watchers, the start of October is living up to its “Uptober” nickname. Crypto advocates have long argued that Bitcoin could serve as a safe haven amid government uncertainty because of its decentralized architecture, though the cryptocurrency has often traded in lockstep with traditional equity markets. But in recent months, investors have poured into Bitcoin amid threats of tariffs. The JPMorgan analysts argued that Bitcoin remains undervalued compared with another favorite hedge among investors: gold. Other cryptocurrencies have also soared in recent days, with Ethereum climbing nearly 9% over the past week to $4,500. Alex Blume, founder and CEO of investment advisor Two Prime, described Bitcoin's recent gains as a “precarious rally” in commentary shared with Fortune, arguing that it might be caused by investors expecting a fourth-quarter rally. Still, Blume pointed out that even stock prices are trending upward, meaning that the market is reacting to broader monetary policy, including the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates. A lone dissenter at the SEC, commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, argued in a statement earlier this week that the new interpretation could open investors up to risks, from theft to misappropriation of their assets. “I fear investors' assets may fall through the cracks,” she wrote.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coinbase's newest lending product is generating profits for the crypto exchange in several ways, but not all are reflected clearly on-chain. As the firm lets customers deposit wrapped Bitcoin and Circle's USDC into “vaults” on decentralized finance protocol Morpho, it's earning cash from stablecoin reserves and transaction fees indirectly. DeFi offers the promise of a more transparent financial system, but it's unclear whether the arrangement poses conflicts of interest or could potentially put user funds at greater risk. Coinbase says that the initiative is addressing investors' growing appetite for ways to use digital assets, unlocking financial empowerment. “We firmly maintain this philosophy when searching for collaborators that can help us bring simple, secure on-chain financial products to our users.” The specifics of Coinbase's arrangement with a so-called curator on Morpho named Steakhouse, through which users are effectively paying the exchange, are not referenced in an FAQ for its product. Vaults on Morpho allow Coinbase users to do two things: They can post Bitcoin as collateral for loans, or they can deposit USDC to earn yield. As users make payments toward loans, a percentage of the yield that vaults generate is directed to “curators,” who serve as chief risk officers and strategists, according to Morpho's documentation. It is providing liquidity for Bitcoin-backed loans on Morpho, while taking a 10% slice of the 6% APY (annual percentage yield) that around $700 million in USDC deposits is currently generating. Steakhouse, meanwhile, is curating a vault that currently lets Coinbase users earn 5.6% APY on USDC. From Coinbase's perspective, it's acting as a "technology provider," enabling users to access decentralized protocols like Morpho, Max Branzburg, head of consumer products at Coinbase, told Decrypt. “This is really about connecting users as a technology platform with DeFi.” Branzburg compared the initiative to Coinbase's recent support of trading on decentralized exchanges, allowing users to natively access more than 40,000 assets through its mobile app, beyond the 330 currently listed on its platform. Samsung Brings Coinbase Access to 75M Wallet Users in Latest Crypto Embrace With borrowed funds, Branzburg said that Coinbase is seeing people fund large purchases like cars or home renovations, without needing to sell their Bitcoin, “empowering people to help grow their wealth in ways that they couldn't otherwise.” “If we're trying to lend off our balance sheet, for example, or build some centralized financing product, it just has inherent limitations,” he said. “A technology platform to connect people with decentralized protocols can scale infinitely.” Although Coinbase's newest lending product has been tapped by more than 14,200 wallets since its introduction in January, that still equates to less than 1% of the firm's users, Branzburg said. The average loan size that users are taking out is around $50,000, he added. Earlier this year, Circle's public debut revealed that Coinbase earns 50% of the “residual payment base” generated by USDC's backing. Last month, Branzburg said that USDC lending rates for Coinbase users were temporarily “boosted” by Morpho. That means Morpho's platform doesn't entirely reflect what Coinbase users are receiving either. In 2022, former SEC Chair and crypto skeptic Gary Gensler cautioned investors that some yields in the cryptosphere appeared “too good to be true.” He also said the public benefits from “full and fair disclosure.” This year, crypto lending is rallying in the U.S. against a more supportive regulatory backdrop.</p>

The proposal underwent a public comment period, concluding on May 19, 2025, during which the DFPI received valuable feedback from various stakeholders. Specifically, activities now regulated under the DFAL, such as transmission and storage of digital assets, are exempt from the MTA to prevent redundant regulation. For example, the definition of “control” in § 1200 was refined to align with Financial Code § 3309, emphasizing that the presumption of control is rebuttable. Token Listing Certification:Section 1250 introduces a certification requirement for covered exchanges listing digital financial assets, ensuring compliance with disclosure and risk assessment protocols.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Earlier this week Swift announced that it is partnering with Consensys to launch a conceptual prototype for a blockchain to form part of its infrastructure. While Consensys's CEO Joe Lubin was reported as saying the ledger is the Linea Layer 2 blockchain, it's more likely to be a clone of Linea as Swift's Chief Innovation Officer Tom Zschach said the ledger did not yet exist. The banking community has been strongly supportive of Swift's initiative with 30 banks involved, but Fireblocks CEO Michael Shaulov was dismissive. Fireblocks is building its own payments network which targets both fintechs and traditional financial institutions. It has secured more than $10 trillion in digital asset transactions and counts BNY, Revolut and Worldpay as clients. In a LinkedIn post, Shaulov pointed to Swift conducting blockchain experiments since 2018 and that banks have lagged fintechs, despite a rapid acceleration this year. He added that Swift's specifications are not appropriate for new market structures.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin rallied on Friday to within striking distance of its record high as the U.S. government's shutdown entered its third day. That's about 1% below its all-time high price of just north of $124,000 that it reached in mid-August. Investors are flocking to the decentralized asset after U.S. lawmakers failed to strike a deal on federal funding, forcing the U.S. government to shutdown on Wednesday. Bitcoin is up 12% this week alone. "The shutdown matters this time around," wrote Standard Chartered's Geoff Kendrick. "During the previous Trump shutdown (22 Dec 2018 to 25 Jan 2019) Bitcoin was in a different place than now, so it did little." "However, this year bitcoin has traded with 'US government risks' as best shown by its relationship to US treasury term premium," added Kendrick. Standard Chartered expects a new high soon and ultimately the crypto hitting $135,000 after that. Traders are turning to crypto and other assets to hedge against mounting political and economic tensions. Spot gold rose 0.5% to $3,876.55 per ounce on early Friday, with prices gaining more than 2% this week. Traders also poured some money into stocks on Friday, despite the increasing geopolitical uncertainties. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Samsung is partnering with Coinbase to let 75 million U.S. Galaxy users access Bitcoin and crypto with Coinbase One's premium features directly through Samsung Wallet, no extra apps required. The union brings Coinbase One's premium features — including zero trading fees and boosted staking rewards — directly into Samsung Wallet, allowing users to explore Bitcoin and crypto without downloading any additional apps or moving funds across different platforms, Coinbase said. The integration will also connect Samsung Pay to Coinbase accounts, allowing Galaxy users to make purchases with Bitcoin and other crypto holdings in the same place they already store payment cards, transit passes, and IDs. For the millions of everyday Americans who own Galaxy devices, this is a major step toward mainstream crypto adoption. “We're pairing their global scale with Coinbase's trusted platform to deliver the best value for people to access crypto — starting with more than 75 million Galaxy users in the U.S., and soon expanding globally,” said Shan Aggarwal, Chief Business Officer at Coinbase. The move highlights a growing trend in mobile finance: bringing Bitcoin and other digital assets directly to users' fingertips. By embedding Bitcoin trading, staking, and payments into a device most Americans already carry, Samsung and Coinbase are removing barriers that have historically kept retail, every-day users from entering the crypto ecosystem. For example, earlier today, OnePay, the fintech venture majority-owned by Walmart, said it will soon allow its customers to buy, sell and hold bitcoin directly in its mobile app. Rothschild & Co Redburn upgraded Coinbase (Nasdaq: COIN) from Neutral to Buy today, raising its stock price target to $417, citing the company's diversification beyond retail trading fees. Transaction fees now make up ~50% of revenue, while institutional adoption, crypto derivatives via Deribit, USDC distribution, and custodial services provide additional growth. Coinbase serves over 200 financial firms and is less reliant on transaction volume than before.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The agreements, which effectively set the terms for potential future work, have a total estimated spend of €432.1m (about £377m) and a potential maximum spend of €1.164 billion (just over £1 billion). The areas of activity and companies are: for ‘alias lookup' – Sapient GmbH & Tremend Software Consulting S.R.L. The announcement comes as a ‘two-year digital euro preparation phase' focused on practical implementation and technical details wraps up this month (October). RELATED ARTICLE ECB kicks off 2024 with hunt for digital euro ‘components and related services' providers – a news story (4 January 2024) on the launch of the process The alias lookup work would facilitate payment transactions by users and intermediaries using simple aliases instead of long account numbers. The app and software development kit (SDK) component consists of a digital euro app and SDK to support intermediaries in the provision of digital euro services through their own apps and online interfaces. The offline services component includes engineering and development services to provide an offline bearer payment instrument (a payment device that functions without an internet connection). In its relatively short announcement (‘ECB selects digital euro service providers' – 2 October), the ECB also names a ‘second-ranked' provider in four of the five areas, stating that these companies ‘will be approached only if required'. The second-ranked offline services provider is to be announced ‘in due course.' RELATED ARTICLE ECB's Cipollone emphasises ‘autonomy and security' of prospective digital euro – a news story on executive board member Piero Cipollone highlighting the prospective digital euro's ability to “bolster Europe's unity, safeguard our autonomy and strengthen our resilience” in a speech in Estonia earlier this week (29 September) It also said that all frameworks were estimated to start in January 2025. All frameworks will run for a minimum four years, with a maximum contract duration of 10 years – or, in two cases, 15 years.The digital euro preparation phase (previously referred to as a ‘realisation phase') follows a digital euro ‘investigation phase' launched by the Eurosystem, which comprises the ECB and the national central banks of the 20 EU member states whose currency is the euro, in October 2021. RELATED ARTICLE ECB announces 70 private-sector partners for digital euro ‘innovation platform' – a news story (7 May 2025) on an ‘innovation platform' (including a list of all participants) – see below Numerous external parties have already been engaged by the ECB on digital euro-related assignments – albeit with significantly lower spend. For example, the ECB awarded framework contracts with five companies for digital euro consultancy (Accenture, BearingPoint, Deloitte Consulting, Oliver Wyman and Roland Berger) in November 2022.The consultancies' framework agreements (which did not entail a definite financial commitment by the ECB towards any specific contractor) are running for four years, with a maximum of two annual extensions. The maximum spend is €20m across all contracts (so, €4m per consultancy if work were to end up being evenly diced). These five companies were not remunerated for their efforts and the ECB said there were no plans to re-use the prototypes in subsequent project phases. In an appearance before a parliamentary committee in September 2022 then-ECB executive board member Fabio Panetta (now Banca d'Italia governor) mounted a sustained defence of the process and purpose of appointing the company, saying that the ECB was solely focused on learning about technological solutions and was not “making any deal on future co-operation.” More recently, the ECB announced in May that it had been working with about 70 market participants through an ‘innovation platform' to explore possible digital euro applications. In the past week it published a 41-page report (‘Digital euro innovation platform – Outcome report: pioneers and visionaries workstreams' – 26 September) and announced a second round of experimentation. Munich-headquartered G+D highlighted that its appointment to deliver the offline solution was alongside partner companies Nexi and Capgemini. ‘Following the framework agreement conclusion, G+D and other successful tenderers will work with the ECB to finalise planning and timelines,' its announcement continued. Feedzai, a Portuguese-based company, similarly makes reference to another company, stating in an announcement that it would deliver – in partnership with subcontractor PwC – ‘a state-of-the-art central fraud detection and prevention mechanism, ensuring full compliance with EU security, privacy and data protection standards.' The company describes its role as being ‘to contribute to safeguarding transactions from fraud by enriching payment service providers' (PSPs) own risk management with insights derived from a central infrastructure-level view.' It explains that ‘for every transaction, whether peer-to-peer (P2P) or peer-to-merchant (P2M), our platform will provide a fraud risk score that PSPs will use alongside their own controls when deciding whether to approve or decline a payment.' ‘The app, designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, will be accessible via smartphone, tablet or smartwatch, offering all European Union [EU] citizens a uniform and secure experience for digital payments,' Almaviva said. ‘This approach will ensure widespread adoption of the new currency and foster innovation throughout the payments ecosystem, strengthening Europe's technological autonomy,' Almaviva added. Senacor, a German company, highlighted its contract award in a LinkedIn post, describing ‘secure exchange of payment information' (SEPI) as ‘the central token service of the digital euro service platform' and explaining that this component ‘replaces sensitive payment information with secure tokens, so that the data does not need to be transmitted directly'.‘A specialised expert team from Senacor, together with European cloud service providers, will drive the development of an advanced solution for SEPI,' the company said.</p>

Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are completely detached from centralised financial institutions, stablecoins are “pegged” to tangible assets, like US dollars, the British pound, or gold prices. With London responsible for 40% of foreign exchange turnover, the prospect of formal UK participation in stablecoins is an attractive one, according to a report by Innovate Finance. Stablecoins can still be risky, even when pegged to tangible assets. If a stablecoin crashes, the fallout could trigger “fire sales” – rapid sales at significantly low prices due to financial distress – to establish an equilibrium, said Bloomberg. Conversely, if stablecoins “prove their worth”, allowing users to exchange and store vast sums of money, the “monetary monopoly” of the banks would be undermined.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The European Central Bank (ECB) has signed a framework agreement with security technology firm Giesecke+Devrient (G+D) and its partners Nexi and Capgemini to deliver offline payment capabilities for the digital euro. The trio, led by Munich-based security firm G+D, ranked first among tenderers for the contract to design, implement and partially operate the system that will allow users to make digital euro payments without internet or power connections. Offline functionality has been positioned as a defining feature of the digital euro. Payments under the offline model are stored directly on user devices such as smartphones, cards or other compatible tools, and are settled locally between devices without passing through banks, payment providers, or the central bank itself. The digital euro is also intended as a complement to banknotes and coins, available to anyone across the euro area and functioning as a universal means of payment. “This milestone underscores our commitment to innovation and security in digital payment solutions while preserving the privacy and resilience that citizens expect from cash.” G+D brings longstanding expertise in currency technology and security systems to the project. Capgemini on the other hand will support development and testing of the offline interfaces, drawing on its background in technology consulting and digital transformation. The digital euro project remains in its preparation phase. The ECB will spearhead the evaluation of technical solutions, legal frameworks and user experience considerations before any decision on issuance is made.

Current Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems exhibit several critical drawbacks, including significant vulnerabilities in security, privacy, and scalability. Traditional centralized databases are highly susceptible to cyber attacks, data breaches, and unauthorized access, posing severe risks to the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive patient information. In addition, these systems often face interoperability issues, which hinder seamless information sharing and access among healthcare providers. The absence of a unified and secure framework exacerbates these problems, leading to operational inefficiencies and increased administrative costs in the management of health records. This study introduces an innovative framework designed to overcome these challenges by integrating blockchain technology with the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). The proposed EHRChain solution leverages attribute-based encryption to provide fine-grained access control, ensuring that only authorized users can retrieve and decrypt medical records. The IPFS framework eliminates single points of failure by storing encrypted data in a decentralized fashion, thus increasing the resilience of the system to cyber attacks. Incorporating blockchain technology ensures the immutability and traceability of medical data, significantly reducing the risks of data tampering. Performance evaluations using real data set simulation demonstrate the efficiency and feasibility of our framework, highlighting its potential to revolutionize the handling of electronic medical records. This study not only underscores the advantages of integrating blockchain with EHR systems but also presents a scalable and secure solution tailored to meet the demands of modern healthcare infrastructures. Our approach promises to improve data security, improve interoperability, and reduce operational inefficiencies, leading to a new standard in electronic health records. As the healthcare sector transitions from traditional paper-based charts to Electronic Health Record (EHR), various solutions have been implemented to manage these records efficiently, aiming to enhance patient safety by preventing errors and increasing information accessibility. EHR2, not only serve as legal evidence and tools for predicting and preventing infectious diseases but also enable physicians to reflect on and share treatment experiences with patients in real-time. By 20253, it is projected that electronic storage will encompass at least 15% of patient medical records, marking a 110% increase from 2018 levels. Typically, medical institutions rely on third-party servers, like cloud servers, to manage encrypted data, which helps reduce computational costs and save space while facilitating efficient data retrieval4. However, the sharing of electronic medical data among medical facilities, though beneficial for providing immediate feedback on patient responses to treatment, raises serious privacy concerns. Once shared, this data is susceptible to illegal misuse, which could compromise patient privacy. Ensuring proper control over access to patient medical records is of paramount importance, with attribute-based encryption (ABE) emerging as a key technique for enforcing access control5. According to reports from the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)6 and the Journal of Healthcare Security7, approximately 81% of healthcare records of Americans have been compromised between 2009 and 2023. In 2023 alone, data breach costs for healthcare organizations reached a record $7, 13 million, a 10% increase over the previous year. These security and privacy breaches present substantial barriers to the effective management and sharing of health records. Thus, there is an urgent need for innovative solutions that ensure the secure and controlled sharing of sensitive medical information among different participants without risking data disclosure or manipulation. An efficient data access mechanism is essential to ensure data security and restrict access to authorized users only. Patients should have the autonomy to decide who can access their medical information8. In recent years, a variety of healthcare applications have been developed that leverage blockchain technology. Azaria et al. introduced MedRec, the first functional shared Electronic Health Record (EHR) system that utilizes blockchain, although it raises concerns related to confidentiality and privacy9. FHIRChain, a system similar to MedRec, uses cryptographic techniques to encrypt and securely share data among clinicians10. Another framework proposed by Dubovitskaya et al. shares similarities with MedRec, allowing patients to share their health records but lacking a mechanism for consent revocation management11. The Centralized Electronic Health Record systems exhibit significant architectural limitations, as demonstrated in Fig. The dependence on opaque third-party storage solutions creates inherent vulnerabilities in data governance, with users lacking visibility into data location and access patterns. These security concerns, visualized in Fig. Challenges in electronic health record (EHR) storage using centralized approach. In contrast, MedShare utilizes blockchain technology to enforce access control and manage health data that is stored on the cloud but faces the challenge of scalability12. Current EHR management schemes13,14 suffer from a number of limitations, indicating demand for progressive solutions. First, there is a major security and privacy risk with the dependence on centralized third-party servers, such as cloud servers. Such centralized systems are susceptible to all sorts of cyber threats such as data breaches and hacker attacks. Healthcare data breaches have recently surged, highlighting the critical need to act upon these vulnerabilities. These challenges are further compounded by the inability of existing systems to ensure data privacy and access control. Such critical medical information can be stored in a centralized database and is vulnerable to unauthorized access and input. When data breaches are leaked, patient privacy is at risk, and even worse, the validity and confidentiality of medical records are called into question. Moreover, the absence of comprehensive systems to share and recover medical information safely restricts collaboration between healthcare providers with EHR to improve patient health. With the advent of blockchain technology15 presents a transformative approach to tackling challenges in healthcare by enabling the secure, tamper-resistant, and decentralized storage of medical records. To mitigate these limitations, we developed a permissionless blockchain-based decentralized system that demonstrates superior performance in terms of response time, processing capacity, and success rate compared to traditional solutions16. Additionally, adopting a blockchain-based model can lead to reduced expenditures related to data administration and inter-institutional data exchange. This blockchain framework is particularly advantageous for enterprise-level applications, including healthcare, as it aligns with the current practices of hospitals and governmental regulatory authorities responsible for generating, overseeing, and regulating healthcare-related data. In the system we propose, access control is managed via the blockchain, while the medical data itself is securely stored in a decentralized file system, specifically the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). In contrast to conventional systems that centralize data, this design improves the system's resilience against security breaches, including Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks and data integrity threats. The deficiencies of current medical record systems will have to be resolved by innovative and practical methodologies in medical record management17 A Potential Solution: Decentralization The central house of blockchain technology accompanied with decentralized file storage like IPFS. By leveraging the natural security properties of blockchain and the distributed nature of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), this approach aims to enhance confidentiality, integrity, and access to Electronic Health Records (EHR). Additionally, by integrating attribute-based encryption (ABE) into this framework, access to sensitive medical information is restricted to authorized users, thereby mitigating the threats of unauthorized access and compromising patient confidentiality. Not only does this strategy cut down on expenses surrounding the management and sharing of information, it makes use of blockchain so the medical histories are saved securely in a way that ensures they cannot be tampered with, and spread out across multiple systems. The purpose of this article is to emphasize the significant gaps and weaknesses present in modern EHR systems18,19,20. Despite the ongoing adoption of EHR with the goal of optimizing healthcare delivery, existing centralized architectures expose healthcare data to substantial security and privacy risks. According to a recent research21, over 70%of healthcare organizations have suffered a data breach at one point in time, resulting in the exposure of millions of patient data. Additionally, HIPAA violations have also seen a rise, and data breaches in the healthcare sector accounts for 45% of all breaches in 2024 to date. Sadly, these alarming statistics illustrate the failings of centralized EHR systems that leave sensitive patient information exposed. Moreover, the rise of cybercriminal attacks in healthcare environments highlights the necessity for more secure and resilient solutions. Traditional security solutions are becoming insufficient to address the sophisticated threats that now target the healthcare industry22. This paper demonstrates how a hybrid solution has been incorporated into medical record management that is securing medical records while also giving patients the opportunity to manage their own data. With the use of blockchain, The integration of Distributed File System (IPFS) and advanced data restriction mechanisms aims to address the inherent weaknesses of current systems, ensuring the privacy and integrity of sensitive medical data, thereby achieving the state-of-the-art in healthcare information management. The key contributions are as follows: Novel Cryptographic Framework: A novel cryptographic framework is developed to enhance the security and efficiency of attribute-based encryption (ABE) schemes. This framework introduces a more robust mechanism for handling dynamic user attributes, ensuring data privacy and security in decentralized environments. Verifiable Keyword Search: Our scheme enables efficient retrieval of medical records through a verifiable keyword search mechanism. This allows users to swiftly identify and verify authentic medical records, enhancing reliability. This ensures only authorized individuals can decrypt and access sensitive medical information, enhancing data security and privacy. Optimized Storage and Computational Costs: Our proposed EHRChain model significantly reduces the storage and computational costs compared to existing solutions. By employing advanced mathematical structures and optimization techniques, we achieve lower costs in key generation, setup, and search operations, as detailed in our experimental results. Section “Related work” delves into the background study concerning the utilization of blockchain and IPFS in healthcare data management. Subsequently, Section “Our proposed EHRChain model” explains the proposed methodology, outlining the attribute-based encryption scheme and its integration with IPFS and blockchain technology. In “Ethereum smart contracts design”, is designed to ensure that the smart contracts are robust, efficient, and secure against various potential threats and vulnerabilities. Section “Result and discussion” details the experimental findings and performance assessment of the proposed system. In “Security analysis”, we discuss the implications of our findings and compare our approach with existing methodologies. Section “Conclusion and future work” presents the conclusions of this study and highlights potential directions for future research in this field. In the medical industry, there is a high level of confidentiality that requires a high level of protection. Participants often have difficulty sharing medical information since they may be exposed or have their data altered during the surgical procedure. In prior research23, efforts have been made to develop innovative blockchain solutions tailored for the storage and exchange of Electronic Health Records (EHR)20. However, some of these proposals have limitations, such as offering only basic privacy controls or advocating for the use of public blockchains with resource-intensive consensus mechanisms24. Other studies suggest utilizing permissioned blockchains for EHR storage, yet they fall short of providing detailed access control for patient information. The healthcare industry will be greatly impacted by blockchain technology. Blockchain technology17 emerges as a cutting-edge solution facilitating decentralized applications without reliance on a central authority, all while upholding crucial security attributes like data integrity, authenticity, non-repudiation, and accountability. At its core, the blockchain data structure consists of interconnected blocks, each linked to its predecessor via cryptographic hash functions. The content of each block contributes to the generation of a hash value, which is then included as a reference in the subsequent block. The Bitcoin white paper was published by Satoshi Nakamoto in 200815, which marked a major technical advancement. Nakamoto envisioned a secure and safe money system using distributed ledger technology called the blockchain. Blockchain technology revolutionized the financial industry. Puneet et al.25 conducted a pioneering study exploring the potential of blockchain technology in revolutionizing the healthcare sector. Their investigation revealed that the healthcare industry is predominantly governed by hospitals, pharmaceutical entities, and various intermediaries. They highlighted data sharing as a pivotal driver for integrating blockchain solutions into healthcare. Dhasarathan et al. (2024)26 proposed a blockchain-based digital credentialing system for participatory governance using the Hyperledger Fabric platform, as also summarized in Table 1. Their system emphasizes transparent and secure issuance and verification of credentials via smart contracts, improving accountability in governance. The design includes modules for credential management, API integration, and smart contract deployment on permissioned blockchains. While their model demonstrates promising scalability and resilience against tampering, the authors acknowledge limitations such as interoperability challenges, scalability bottlenecks in large deployments, and user adoption barriers in real-world public administration settings. Table 1 provides an overview of existing blockchain-based approaches, outlining their primary contributions and associated limitations. This comparative synthesis serves to contextualize the challenges in current research and underscores the necessity of developing a more secure, scalable, and interoperable framework for electronic health record management. The study identified four key transformative factors necessitating blockchain adoption in healthcare: digital access rights management, enhanced data availability, expedited access to clinical records, and streamlined patient identity verification. Additionally, the study deliberated on the intricacies of on-chain and off-chain data storage, addressing challenges such as managing voluminous clinical records, ensuring security and privacy, and fostering patient engagement. Patil et al.,36 have proposed an ABE scheme for encrypting medical records on the cloud. Data on a patient's condition and the department that the doctor practices in were compiled without divulging the specific nature of their condition or their illness. However, the paper uses symmetric encryption, which must be implemented by an entirely transparent Global Authority, which will issue public parameters for the system and generate secret keys for the doctor, which is the main limitation of this scheme. A Hyperledger-based Blockchain system called MediChainTM was developed to manage medical data assets. The system is comprised of three components: an access control module, a data repository off-chain, and a user interface. This system, however, does not take interoperability into account. To provide integrity to patient records,13 proposed a Blockchain-based handshaking mechanism for integrating an existing cloud-based EHR system with a public Blockchain. There are some issues still associated with these strategies, such as preventing internal malicious activity and being protected from cloud server malfunctions, even though they offer secure cloud storage and fine-grained access control. Don Charles et al.,27 explores the implementation of a blockchain-based payment system to facilitate a potential emissions trading scheme in the Caribbean region. The author discusses the use of blockchain technology to streamline cross-border transactions and enable efficient trading of emissions allowances. However, a potential shortcoming of this paper may be the lack of in-depth analysis on the practical challenges and feasibility of implementing such a system in the Caribbean context, including regulatory, technical, and economic considerations. Gaur et al.,28 investigates abusive adversarial agents and attack strategies within cyber-physical systems. It delves into various forms of attacks and strategies employed by adversarial agents to compromise the integrity and security of cyber-physical systems. However, a potential shortcoming of this paper could be the limited exploration of defensive mechanisms or countermeasures to mitigate the identified threats, which could provide a more comprehensive understanding of cybersecurity in cyber-physical systems. In Table 2, we present a comparative analysis between our proposed approach and the work by Ramesh et al. (2023)31. The table highlights key features crucial for blockchain-enabled Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems, including access control mechanisms, scalability, interoperability, security measures, data integrity, and performance optimizations. Our approach emphasizes multi-factor authentication (MFA) and attribute-based encryption (ABE) for robust access control, off-chain storage to efficiently manage large EHR datasets, and standardized data formats to enhance interoperability. In contrast, Ramesh et al. primarily focus on tamper-proof storage with basic access controls and blockchain-based data integrity. This comparison underscores the advancements and distinctive features of our methodology in addressing critical challenges in secure and scalable EHR management. Namasudra et al.,24 proposed a decentralized and secure cab sharing system leveraging blockchain technology. It focuses on enhancing trust and security in ride-sharing services while decentralizing control and minimizing the need for intermediaries. However, a potential limitation of this work may be the scalability of blockchain-based systems in handling high transaction volumes and ensuring real-time responsiveness, especially in dynamic transportation environments. Further exploration into optimizing the performance and scalability of blockchain-based cab sharing systems may be necessary to address these challenges. Ramesh et al.31 introduced a blockchain-based solution for efficient and tamper-proof storage of Electronic Health Records (EHR) in decentralized cloud-assisted storage systems. However, there may be scalability issues within a blockchain system when it comes to managing vast amounts of EHR data and granting timely access to records in an emergency. Moreover, especially regarding transaction verification and consensus mechanisms, the overhead brought by blockchain could slow down the system negatively affecting efficiency and responsiveness. These challenges require further investigation to improve the performance of blockchain-based EHR storage solutions. The blockchain-based information management systems, MedBlock6 and MedChain37, support secure and efficient access to electronic medical records. Blockchain technology was used to access medical information. MedBlock was conceived as a system for sharing healthcare data for diagnostic and research purposes. It gives patients access to their healthcare records. However, the adopted approach does not provide complete data privacy protection since local hospitals' databases are involved. Aside from that, MedBlock only holds hospital medical records of patients collected from medical examinations and does not store their physiological conditions. Currently, patients are unable to transfer their healthcare data and reports to the Blockchain network. In23 proposes MedChain as a circumvent to these limitations: a session-based healthcare data sharing system based on blockchain technology. In addition to managing and sharing patients' EHR, MedChain allows for sharing their physiological parameters from connected Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)) devices. Transparency and integrity are guaranteed with MediChain, but accessibility and scalability are seriously limited. In addition, the proposed solution does not support the expansion of service providers within healthcare organizations. There are several advantages offered by the use of blockchain for biomedical or healthcare domains, including decentralization, persistence of clinical or medical records, data quality control, and continuous access to data as well as secure information being accessible to healthcare stakeholders. Several challenges with blockchain technology include confidentiality, speed, scalability, and malicious attacks, such as 51% of attacks. As sensitive medical and clinical records are stored on these systems, these limitations are critical for the healthcare and biomedical sectors. According to the authors, these issues can be resolved with the use of VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) to ensure privacy, encryption of data, and off-chain storage of sensitive medical data. In29 proposes a blockchain-based approach for preserving privacy in IoT-enabled healthcare systems. It focuses on leveraging blockchain technology to enhance data security and privacy in healthcare environments. However, a potential limitation of this paper may lie in the practical implementation and scalability of the proposed blockchain-based solution in real-world healthcare settings. Explore whether deploying such a system on large-platform healthcare infrastructures is practical through more conversations on the challenges this may pose. In30 Zheng et al. present another approach to privacy-preserving image recognition in remote sensing which makes use of limited visual cryptography. It aims to achieve better privacy protection for sensitive remote sensing data while facilitating accurate image recognition tasks. Yet, the only restriction this approach may face is with the large-scale remote sensing images and real-time requirements. This is particularly so since they do not always imply greater suitability and efficiency of the proposed method to manage broad and versatile remote sensing image datasets. Datta et al.,32 present a blockchain-enabled smart contract model that combines consumer electronics and mobile edge computing to protect healthcare transactions. The model proposed in this paper combines blockchain technologies and smart contracts to strengthen security and privacy for healthcare transactions, along with consumer electronics and mobile edge computing for data processing and management. However, one of the limitations of this work can be the intricate nature and interoperability problems related to the introduction of wide-ranging consumer electronics, mobile edge computing, and blockchain technologies into the healthcare domain. To achieve the seamless integration and functionality of the proposed model in real-world healthcare environments, further research and development efforts may be needed. In the proposed scheme, bilinear mapping is employed as a fundamental component for the implementation of attribute-based encryption (ABE). This choice is motivated by the unique properties and advantages that bilinear mappings offer, particularly in the context of secure and efficient access control mechanisms for electronic medical records (EMRs). We denote both \(G_{0}\) and \(G_{1}\) as cyclic multiplicative groups composed of large prime numbers \(\rho\). Let \(\rho\) be an element of R and \({\mathscr {Q}}\) be the starting point for these groups, containing an element that maps to \(G_{T}\), the same class of cyclic multiplicative groups, represented by 1. \({\hat{e}}\) is considered a bilinear map if it satisfies the following criteria18,36: Computability: For any elements \(\forall X \in G_0\), \(\forall Y \in G_1\), there exists at least one efficient way to compute \({\hat{e}}(X, Y) \in G_T\). An access structure33, denoted by \({\mathscr {W}}\), is defined as \({\mathscr {W}} = \{w_1, w_2, \ldots , w_n\}\), with each \(w_i\) belonging to \({\mathscr {L}}_{i}\). It important to note that \({\mathscr {S}} \models {\mathscr {W}}\) if the attribute set \({\mathscr {S}}\) meets the access structure \({\mathscr {W}}\), i.e., \({\mathscr {S}}_{i}\) equals \({\mathscr {W}}_{i}\) for all \(i = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots , n\}\). In the proposed scheme, bilinear mapping is crucial for implementing attribute-based encryption (ABE), chosen for its unique properties that enhance secure and efficient access control for electronic medical records (EMRs). Bilinear mappings facilitate the construction of ABE schemes, allowing for fine-grained access control. This means access to encrypted data can be regulated based on the user's attributes rather than their identity, enabling a more nuanced and secure access control mechanism. Additionally, bilinear mappings support the encryption and decryption processes for complex access policies efficiently, which is critical for medical records where different users (e.g., doctors, nurses, administrators) require varying levels of access based on their roles. The mathematical properties of bilinear maps are essential for ABE. This property is crucial for combining user attributes and access policies in a way that allows for efficient encryption and decryption. Furthermore, the nondegeneracy property ensures that there exists at least one pair \((X, Y) \in G_1 \times G_2\) such that \({\hat{e}}(X, Y) \ne 1\), providing meaningful cryptographic results essential for security. The computability property ensures that \({\hat{e}}(X, Y)\) can be computed efficiently for any \(X \in G_1\) and \(Y \in G_2\), which is important for practical implementation and performance. The security of ABE schemes built on bilinear mappings relies on well-established cryptographic hardness assumptions, such as the Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (BDH) assumption. These assumptions provide strong guarantees against various cryptographic attacks, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of medical data. Bilinear mappings also allow for dynamic user management, enabling the addition and revocation of users without requiring re-encryption of existing data. This scalability is vital in a healthcare setting where user roles and permissions frequently change. Furthermore, the scheme can efficiently handle updates to access policies, making it adaptable to changing security requirements and user roles. In our proposed EHRChain model, four primary entities collaborate to ensure secure and efficient electronic health record management: the blockchain, the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), the medical system (comprising doctors and smart healthcare devices), and the data user system. These components collectively represent the main entities and operational processes that underpin our framework (see Fig. Our proposed EHRChain framework ensures secure data handling and scalable storage by integrating two core technologies: Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). ABE provides a fine-grained cryptographic access control mechanism that allows data owners to define access policies based on descriptive user attributes (e.g., role, department, or clearance level). This enables decentralized and flexible access control, aligning with the complex authorization requirements inherent in healthcare data sharing. For off-chain storage, EHRChain leverages IPFS, a peer-to-peer distributed file system that retrieves content using unique cryptographic hashes instead of traditional location-based addresses. Encrypted patient records are stored on IPFS, while their corresponding hash references are anchored on the blockchain. This design preserves data immutability and integrity, reduces on-chain storage overhead, and ensures efficient data retrieval. Together, ABE and IPFS form the foundational pillars of the EHRChain framework, facilitating privacy-preserving access control and scalable, decentralized storage for secure electronic health record management. Doctors are responsible for encrypting and saving medical records. They utilize encryption and indexing algorithms to secure medical records and generate indexes for keywords. The encrypted records are then stored in IPFS, and their hash values, along with IPFS hash addresses, are recorded on the blockchain. System smart devices handle the registration of hospital personnel, assigning secret private keys associated with their attributes. Data users (DU) can be doctors, nurses, researchers, patients, etc. Each DU is assigned a key pair associated with their attributes by the system. After confirming their attributes meet system access policies, the DU receives a token to search for medical records. In our scheme, medical data is stored and searched using the Ethereum blockchain platform. Since blockchains are immutable, they are a reliable source for verifying data authenticity and integrity, due to their inability to be arbitrarily modified. A unique hash value is assigned to each file based on its content. Furthermore, IPFS uses deduplication to effectively avoid redundant data storage. IPFS is used for medical records storage in our scheme. In our proposed framework (see Fig. 3), a key feature of our proposed EHRChain Model is the incorporation of a fine-grained access control scheme, which ensures that only authorized users can access specific medical records. This access control mechanism is tightly integrated with advanced data encryption techniques, safeguarding sensitive patient information from unauthorized access. We utilize robust key management protocols to securely distribute and manage encryption keys, adding an additional layer of security. Furthermore, EHRChain Model employs a hybrid storage solution where actual medical data is stored in a blockchain-friendly off-chain tool like IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). The hash generated from storing data on IPFS is then placed on the blockchain. This approach combines the immutable and transparent properties of blockchain with the scalable and efficient storage capabilities of IPFS, ensuring both security and efficiency in managing large volumes of medical data. Our proposed system model securely manages Electronic Health Record (EHR) using Ethereum blockchain and IPFS. Medical records are encrypted and stored on IPFS, with the hash address recorded on the blockchain. Authorized users can retrieve and decrypt the records, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality through cryptographic techniques. This case study demonstrates the functionality and security features of our proposed EHRChain Model in real-world applications. This information, denoted as \(P\), includes all relevant medical details. Step 2:  Once the documentation is complete, Dr. Bob provides Alice with a private key, denoted as \(K_p\). Step 4:  The encrypted MongoDB symmetric key, denoted as \(E(K_{sym})\), is retrieved and decrypted using Dr. Bob's private key \(K_{bob}\). Step 6:  The encrypted PDF file \(E_{\text {PDF}}\) is stored on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). IPFS generates a Content Identifier (CID) for the stored file. Step 7:  The generated CID is then stored in a block on the Ethereum blockchain network as part of a transaction. This transaction ensures that the CID and, therefore,fore, the linencrypted patient information is immutable and securely stored on blockchain. This encrypted record \(CT^* = (CT, sigR)\) is stored in IPFS, which provides a hash address h corresponding to \(CT^*\). Furthermore, the hash value hR of the medical record and an encrypted hash address h0 are transmitted to the blockchain as part of a transaction, generating a block ID. Step 9:  When Alice needs to access her medical records, she sends an access request with keywords to the hospital. Upon verification, the system's smart contract issues a search token \(STw = (ID, h, \gamma )\) to the authorized Data User (DU), such as Alice or a healthcare provider. The proposed EHRChain model ensures that Alice's patient information is securely documented, encrypted, and stored in a decentralized manner, leveraging the security and transparency of blockchain technology. The EHRChain framework is architected to support interoperability with widely recognized Electronic Health Record (EHR) standards, specifically Health Level Seven (HL7) and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). This interoperability is achieved through standardized API interfaces and a data translation layer capable of mapping blockchain-anchored metadata and IPFS-stored encrypted patient records into FHIR-compliant JSON resources message formats. In contrast, clinical data originating in HL7 format are processed by the ingestion module, which parses HL7 segments and maps them to the standardized schema of EHRChain prior to encryption and offline storage. By incorporating these mechanisms, EHRChain enables healthcare organizations to integrate the proposed blockchain-based system without disrupting existing EHR infrastructures, while maintaining data portability, regulatory compliance, and alignment with established interoperability frameworks. In our proposed framework (see Fig. 4), administrators and users interact through a decentralized application (DApp). Users, such as doctors and patients, are assigned roles defined by the system administrator, typically a hospital administrator. These roles govern granular access to the system's functionalities and data, ensuring secure and controlled operations. This case study illustrates the real-world application of our proposed EHRChain Model. In our scheme, we simulate the process of a patient Alice, who has been admitted to the hospital and then returns home. This detailed process demonstrates the practical application of our proposedEHRChain Model, ensuring secure, efficient, and controlled access to medical records in a real-world healthcare setting. EHRChain Model as an example, where administrators and users, including doctors and patients, interact through a decentralized application (DApp) where roles defined by the system administrator ensure secure and controlled access to medical data. This case study demonstrates the functionality and security features of our proposed EHRChain Model in real-world applications. Each user in the system has a role name and an account address. When a user requests an operation after roles have been assigned, the system checks the user's account address and role name from the Roles List. Given a security parameter \(\lambda\), the system initially generates a set of public parameters \((G1, G2, GT, \lambda , e, p, g1, g2)\), where G1 and G2 denote two cyclic multiplicative groups with prime order p. The elements g1 and g2 serve as generators for G1 and G2 respectively, with \(g1 \in G1\) and \(g2 \in G2\). Additionally, \(e: G1 \times G2 \rightarrow GT\) represents the bilinear map. Furthermore, a collision-resistant hash function \(H: \{0, 1\}^{\lambda } \rightarrow {\mathbb {Z}}_p^*\) is established. Step 1: Registration and Diagnosis - Dr. Bob, a physician at the General Hospital, registers the patient Alice and generates a medical record R for him. The attributes for Alice are: \(S = \{name: Alice, age: 28, gender: male, identity: patient\}\), based on which a public-private key pair is generated. Subsequently, the system proceeds to randomly select parameters \(\alpha , \beta , \sigma \in {\mathbb {Z}}_p^*\). For instance, if \(i = 1\) corresponds to a doctor, \(i = 2\) to a nurse, and \(i = 3\) to an expert, then \(m_1\) represents the total count of doctors, and \(m_3\) represents the total count of experts. The equation outlines the setup process for a cryptographic system utilizing bilinear pairings and random parameter generation. It initializes public parameters including cyclic multiplicative groups G1 and G2 with prime order p, along with generators g1 and g2. The system has roles and account addresses for each user. A user's account address and role name are checked from the Roles List when they request an operation after roles have been assigned. Meanwhile, the DU generates a search request utilizing its search private key and subsequently decrypts the medical records using its corresponding secret private key, which is linked to its set of attributes. Subsequently, it derives the public-private key pair (pko, sko) as follows: The public-private key pair (pko, sko) is then derived as \(pko = (Y, B, u_1, A_{i,t}, 1 \le t \le m_i, 1 \le i \le m_g)\). Additionally, it selects two random numbers \(x_i, \lambda _i \in {\mathbb {Z}}^*_p\), where \(1 \le i \le m_g\), and computes \(x = \sum _{i=1}^{m_g} x_i\), along with \(d_0 = g^{\alpha \cdot x \cdot \beta }\). Random values \(r_i\) are selected for each attribute number i, and the ciphertext CT is computed based on the policy and associated attributes. Next, the doctor uploads \(CT^* = (CT, sigR)\) via IPFS, which provides h for \(CT^*\). Initially, he extracts the keyword \(w = (w_1, w_2,..., w_m)\) from the medical record R. Subsequently, he chooses a random value \(y \in {\mathbb {Z}}_p^*\) and calculates \(I_1 = g^y \cdot H(w_1||w_2||\dots ||w_m)\) and \(I_2 = u_1 \cdot \prod _{i,t \in W_i} A_{i,t}^y\). Upon identity verification of the DU by the system's smart device, a search token is provided. As soon as the Data User (DU) requests access, a test is performed by the smart device to determine whether the DU has authorization to access medical records containing \(w_0 = (w_{01}, w_{02},..., w_{0m})\). Medical records R that \(h_{[0R]} = h_R\) can be considered original if \(h_{[0R]} = h_R\). The decryption operation in our proposed scheme is governed by a pairing-based computation, where the final result \(R'\) is derived by combining ciphertext components with user-specific decryption keys, as illustrated in Eq. Once the Data User (DU) receives the ciphertext \(CT = (C_0, C_0, (C_{i,1}, C_{i,t,2})_{1 \le t \le m_i, 1 \le i \le m})\), he proceeds to decrypt it using his secure private key \(sk_S\). The decrypted medical record \(R'\) is computed as: (6), the decryption result \(R'\) is computed through bilinear pairings over the ciphertext components and corresponding secret keys. Smart contracts play a pivotal role in our DApp ecosystem, enabling essential operations and interactions. Our framework includes the following contracts: These contracts are instrumental in realizing the functionalities of our proposed framework, ensuring seamless interactions and robust data management. The primary smart contract in our system is responsible for executing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on patient records while also defining access roles. This library offers tested and community-reviewed code, ensuring reliability. The Roles contract provides a granular role definition mechanism, making it an ideal choice for our system. It comprises five functions: role definition, addition, viewing, updating, and deletion of records. These functions are accessible to administrators and other system users. The algorithm described in Algorithm 1 defines a function named AddPatientRecord, which is intended to be executed within a smart contract. This function is designed to facilitate the addition of new patient records to a healthcare system. It accepts as input the variables necessary to include data in a patient's record. Similar to the previous algorithm, this function begins by verifying the identity of the caller (msg.sender) to ensure that only authorized users, specifically doctors, can execute this function. This typically involves creating a new entry in the database or appending the provided information to an existing patient record. Overall, this algorithm provides a secure and controlled mechanism for adding new patient records within a blockchain-based healthcare system. The algorithm described in Algorithm 2 defines a function named UpdatePatientRecord, which is intended to be executed within a smart contract. This function is designed to facilitate the updating of patient records in a secure and controlled manner.It given input to the values it needs to change within a patient's record. sender, so that only authorized users can use this function. For example, this usually means updating the same fields in the patient record as you can provide input variables. Moreover, if the caller fails to identify himself or herself as a doctor, the function ends the session, denying them access to data such as patient records. Algorithm 3 describes an algorithm that implements a function called AbortSession that can be run in a smart contract. It is designed for logging out from the health care system. This function does not require any input parameters like previous algorithms as it will end the ongoing session. What the function does is simply log you out or end your active session when you run it This is critical for maintaining security and privacy in the healthcare system, as users should be able to log out when they have completed their tasks or when they need to log out from the system. The function implemented in Algorithm 4 is called DeletePatientRecord and it would be executed in a smart contract to delete patient records within the healthcare system. However, if the identifiers do not match, it means that the provided identifier does not correspond to an existing record so the function returns a failure message. If the sender is not, the function stops immediately to avoid an unauthorized doctor access. It helps protect the integrity and privacy of patient data for authorized medical personnel, who may, if need be, remove patient records while ensuring the protection of sensitive healthcare data. Through rigorous testing and analysis, we assess the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of the framework in addressing key challenges and vulnerabilities inherent in the adoption of novel technologies like blockchain-based solutions. Based on testing and assessment we investigate how well the framework quantities the challenges and vulnerabilities in the new technology, including efficiency, network/computation cost and robustness of solution relative to using a blockchain-based solution. The experiment setup is crucial in evaluating the functionality and efficiency of any framework or system. For our study, we prepared an experimental set-up specifically designed for performance testing in order to reproduce the findings correctly and without distortion. Experimental Setup: The experiment environment includes the hardware configuration, software tools, transaction dataset, evaluation metrics, and performance evaluation methods. All performance tests are done in a high-end desktop machine where we have more than sufficient processors, RAM, and so on. Hardware Configuration: Intel Core i7-6498DU CPU at 2.50GHz (base) and up to 2.60GHz (turbo boost) For RAM, the system sported 8.00 GB, or enough memory to run demanding computational processes. We were able to leverage different tools which served for the different purposes and contributed to the overall process of performance testing. Using Remix – an online Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing, compiling, and deploying Ethereum smart contracts – made it possible to conduct programming in an easy to use interface. Simulation and development of the smart contracts that forms our suggested framework using Remix IDE With its web-based interface, it facilitated direct interaction with the Ethereum blockchain, allowing for on-spot testing and debugging of smart contracts. For the dApp, we use Metamask41, an Ethereum browser extension that is used as a digital wallet and as a bridge between web browsers and the Ethereum blockchain. In order to deploy and test the smart contracts on the Ethereum test network (Rinkby), we use Metamask. This made signing and broadcasting transactions easy and allowed the execution of smart contracts in the sandbox, simplified by its integration with different web browsers. Smart Contract Implementation - Solidity We used Solidity to implement the logic and functionality of smart contracts governing our proposed system. We utilized Solidity for our smart contracts and integrated them with Remix IDE to ensure the integrity of transactional items we were dealing with this way, adding the final layer of usability to our experimental environment. To simulate a realistic healthcare data environment, we generated a synthetic dataset comprising 5,000 electronic health record (EHR) transactions. Each transaction emulates common operations in a decentralized medical data management system, such as role assignment, patient record creation, update, retrieval, and deletion. The dataset was constructed to reflect typical healthcare system dynamics, incorporating various user roles (e.g., physicians, administrative staff, and data users) and record attributes such as patient identifiers, medical categories, timestamps, access privileges, and digital signatures. The simulated transactions were subjected to Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) based on dynamic policy structures and were subsequently offloaded to IPFS for decentralized storage. Only the cryptographic hashes of these files were anchored to the Ethereum testnet, mimicking real-world system behavior while ensuring system efficiency and privacy compliance. This dataset model enabled us to assess how well the proposed EHRChain framework handles concurrent access, access control enforcement, and decentralized data storage under realistic operational conditions. The experimental evaluation was guided by a multi-dimensional set of performance criteria aimed at assessing the system's responsiveness, scalability, and resource efficiency under varied workloads. Execution Time: This metric quantifies the temporal duration between the submission of a smart contract transaction and its successful confirmation on the blockchain. Throughput (Transactions/sec): Defined as the average number of successfully processed transactions per unit time. This measures the system's capacity to handle concurrent operations, a critical factor in scalable healthcare infrastructure. Latency: Measured as the delay between a user-initiated request and the receipt of a system response. This includes smart contract call delays and consensus-related propagation times across the blockchain network. Gas Consumption and Transaction Fees: Each smart contract function incurs a gas cost, which is converted into Ether based on current gas prices. We calculated the financial cost of deploying and executing AssignRoles, AddRecord, ViewRecord, UpdateRecord, and DeleteRecord operations to analyze the cost-effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Storage Overhead: We evaluated the memory footprint introduced by storing encrypted EHRs on IPFS and maintaining their metadata on-chain. The analysis includes transaction payload sizes and their effect on blockchain bloat and off-chain storage scalability. Apache JMeter was configured to simulate multi-user access patterns and concurrency levels ranging from 100 to 500 simultaneous users. Performance profiling was conducted in real time, enabling us to benchmark execution time variations, stress-test system throughput, and evaluate responsiveness under transactional load. This comprehensive performance evaluation demonstrates the viability of our framework for secure, scalable, and decentralized healthcare data management in practical deployment scenarios. Transaction deployment time was the time taken to deploy a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, while Transaction Completion Time was the time needed for a transaction to complete and to be confirmed by the blockchain network. We perform simulations of real-world scenarios to evaluate how well our custom framework performs under the different quoting conditions. For this application, Apache JMeter was used as a performance testing tool to analyze the application's performance. To run these tests, we set up Apache JMeter to simulate multiple concurrent users using the system at the same time and record execution time, throughput, and latency as performance metrics. Through a rigorous analysis of the performance data and an in-depth evaluation of the framework, we obtained meaningful insights into its scalability, efficiency, and reliability. For instance, single-user functions such as “Assign Roles”, “Add Patient Records”, and “View Patient Records” exhibited execution times of approximately 18.29 s, 1 min 48 s, and 50 s respectively. These times increased proportionally with the number of concurrent users, demonstrating the scalability of our framework. Simulations were conducted with user loads ranging from 100 to 500. 5, show the system's ability to handle varying loads efficiently. Throughput of the our proposed EHRChain framework. Latency, defined as the delay between sending a request and receiving a response, was evaluated using JMeter. Average latency of our proposed EHRChain framework. The average latency, or the delay between sending a request and receiving a response, was also evaluated using JMeter. This metric is crucial for understanding the system's responsiveness under different conditions. There is a data payload field in every Ethereum transaction. The data payload is encoded in hexadecimal format and consists of bytes. In this section, we will discuss two Algorithm functions that we can use to gain a deeper understanding of data payload included in transactions. An optional data payload field is used when interacting with contract functions during a transaction. Keccak-256 hash identifies a smart contract function by the first four bytes of the function selector. There are several types of static and dynamic elements in the function arguments, each of which is encoded differently in the payload. For an understanding of how data is generated, let us examine the payload from the Define Roles function in Algorithms. As a first step, we will separate the argument selector from the function selector. Function selectors are function signatures, such as the following: 0x 28e4a6af  In this case, the function selector represents the hashed string of DefineRoles(address,uint256). Lastly, by looking at the data payload we can get useful information about state changes in Ethereum transactions and smart contracts. When we can split the transaction payloads into their function selector and function arguments, we get a more in-depth look at how the smart contracts work. This emphasizes allows us to optimize the encoding and processing of these elements, further improving transaction efficiency. We use the types of the arguments in our functions to differentiate static and dynamic types, which allows us to use our channels more effectively as an encoding mechanism. This difference is an important one for reducing the amount of data sent in each payload and thus for enhancing the throughput of Ethereum transactions. We present a framework for estimating transaction sizes and costs around data payloads. Such an estimation is critically important to the understanding and management of the economic side of implementing blockchain-based solutions in healthcare. Assuming a gas rate of 21 Gwei and a consumption rate of 21,000, we can calculate the transaction fee as follows: This shows the fee calculation in both Ether and Gwei units. We provide a thorough analysis of the costs associated with Ethereum transactions, including gas consumption and transaction fees. Our framework includes strategies to optimize these costs, making it more economical for real-world applications. By ensuring secure storage and transmission of sensitive data, our approach addresses significant security concerns in healthcare data management. We validate its performance using real-world data and a comprehensive experimental setup, demonstrating its practicality and effectiveness in managing medical records. We introduce and evaluate specific performance metrics such as execution time, latency, and throughput using tools like Remix, Metamask, and the Rinkeby test network. These metrics provide a clear and quantifiable measure of the framework performance improvements. The storage and computational costs analysis about the different algorithms in Sharma et al. (2024)43, Sultana et al. (2024)21, and in our proposed study respectively. It appears that although our scheme incurs a higher storage cost in the KeyGen algorithm compared to schemes Sharma et al. (2024)43 and Sultana et al. (2024)21, the storage costs in Setup/Init, Trap/Index, and Search are significantly lower than those schemes. In this function, both static and dynamic types have a 32-byte size. We can estimate the transaction sizes of our proposed framework by using the data payload. These transactions' sizes are shown in Table 3. Moreover, it is important to remember that the transaction size calculated in this section is based on the data payload and specifically calculated for each function. In contrast, the transaction size has been calculated from a block size perspective and is a generalized calculation. In addition, the proposed framework allows us to calculate the cost associated with various transactions. There are certain units associated with Ethereum, such as wei and gwei, which are used for calculating transaction fees. This article also discusses the formula for calculating Ethereum transactions fees. For a transaction, the transaction fee is calculated by multiplying gas consumed by gas price. The performance of the proposed EHRChain framework was rigorously evaluated with respect to two primary operational metrics: scalability, quantified as Transactions Per Second (TPS), and latency, defined as the mean transaction finality time from request submission to blockchain confirmation. Comparative analysis was conducted against two representative blockchain-based EHR management models: (i) Ramesh et al. (2023)31, which employs a fully on-chain architecture with Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), and (ii) Sharma et al. (2024)43, which adopts a blockchain–cloud hybrid approach leveraging conventional symmetric encryption for off-chain data handling. The performance of the proposed EHRChain framework was evaluated against existing approaches by Ramesh et al. (2023) and Sharma et al. (2024). 8, EHRChain consistently achieves higher throughput in terms of transactions per second while maintaining significantly lower latency under varying concurrent user loads. This demonstrates the scalability and efficiency of our framework compared to prior solutions. (b) Average transaction latency in milliseconds. EHRChain was deployed with a hybrid PoS+PBFT consensus protocol and integrated with the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for off-chain storage. Performance benchmarking was conducted using the Hyperledger Caliper framework, with simulated transaction loads of 100, 300, and 500 concurrent requests. To ensure methodological rigor, identical transaction payloads and system configurations were applied across all comparative models. EHRChain demonstrated superior throughput characteristics under increasing workloads. At 500 concurrent transactions, the framework sustained a throughput of 248 TPS, corresponding to a 7.4% degradation relative to the 100-user baseline (268 TPS). By contrast, Sharma et al.43 model achieved 198 TPS (12.2% degradation), while Ramesh et al.31 fully on-chain system recorded 143 TPS (21.6% degradation). These results indicate that the decoupling of bulk EHR data from on-chain storage significantly mitigates consensus bottlenecks, thereby enhancing scalability. EHRChain also outperformed the baseline systems in transaction finality time. At peak load, the average latency was 412 ms, representing a 47.2% reduction relative to Ramesh et al. (781 ms) and a 26.8% reduction compared to Sharma et al.43 (563 ms). The latency gains are attributable to reduced block payload sizes, parallelized IPFS retrieval, and an optimized consensus configuration tuned for healthcare transaction patterns. The empirical results confirm that EHRChain maintains high throughput and low latency under concurrent load conditions typical of real-world healthcare environments. The hybrid consensus protocol, combined with off-chain IPFS storage, delivers a balanced performance profile that addresses both the scalability limitations of fully on-chain systems and the latency constraints of cloud-based hybrids. Consequently, the framework is well-positioned for deployment in scenarios demanding real-time, privacy-preserving, and high-volume medical data exchange. There is no proof in the literature that an adversary is capable of winning the original game G. Thus, we prove that our scheme is secure by exploiting the indistinguishability of \(G, G_0, \ldots , G_{l-1}, G_l\). In-game \(G_0\), if the adversary does not have \(sk_S\) generated from S such that \(S \models W_0 \wedge S \models W_1\), the adversary will choose a random number in GT as the ciphertext component \(C_0\), while the rest will remain unchanged. Aside from the b, the adversary generates component \(C_0\) which is the same as in-game G based on their attribute S. In this case, \(G = G_0\). Assuming asymmetric DBDH, the difference in adversary advantage A between games G and \(G_0\) is negligible with the security parameter k. Given the asymmetric challenge tuple \(h(g_1, g_2, g_{Z11}, g_{Z12}, g_{Z22}, g_{Z23}, Z)\), where \(Z = e(g_1, g_2)^{Z1Z2Z3}\) is equivalent to a random number with the same probability. The security proof our proposedEHRChain model involves a thorough evaluation to ensure its robustness against potential vulnerabilities. EHRChain utilized the open-source tool Oyente, which applies symbolic execution techniques to scrutinize smart contracts by executing functions step by step. Oyente operates exclusively with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and does not require access to high-level representations like Solidity or Serpent. Our focus was on bolstering the security of a blockchain-based healthcare system designed for managing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) securely. In frame number 1, Alice is a healthcare provider who interacts with a critical smart contract in our blockchain healthcare system that handles the access control to patient records. The goal was to employ strong security practices to protect patient data privacy, correctness, and availability. Step 2. we chose Oyente, as it has the ability to symbolically execute and systematically explore paths in Ethereum smart contracts. Insolvency for example, If contract malicious user invokes it – This would allow for detailed examination of possible entry points for attacks like reentrancy, integer overflow or underflow, out-of-gas errors, unexpected state changes and cross-function state changes, etc. The step-by-step simulation performed by Oyente explores different execution paths and input variations to find vulnerabilities. During this audit, it found a critical reentrancy vulnerability in the access control function of our smart contract. An attacker named Bob could use recursive calls to adjust privileges and attack the program using this vulnerability. This guarantees that all critical functions begin with condition validation (Checks), state modification based upon validated conditions (Examples), and secure external interaction handling (Interactions). This added a layer of protection only an internal call to the guard would let the process continue, and when reentrancy was detected it would revert the entire transaction. After implementing the mitigation strategies, we re-executed Oyente to check if our mitigation strategies were effective. Later reports showed a marked decrease in flagged vulnerabilities, a sign that the effort was leading to an enhanced security posture and greater resilience to the common threats faced by blockchain projects. This work illustrates how the use of Oyente for tool-based assessment allowed to discover serious vulnerabilities and in addition to address their effective mitigation in our blockchain-based healthcare system. This perspective safeguards patient data saved onboard development while also navigating developing security hazards. The security analysis, illustrated in Fig. Both of these vulnerabilities are manageable and temporary. Security proof of our proposed EHRChain system model. A comparative evaluation of blockchain-based methodologies focusing on access control, scalability, and contributions to the field is presented in Table 4. This table contrasts previous studies with the proposed EHRChain model, demonstrating how our approach uniquely integrates blockchain, fine-grained access control, and scalability features to address gaps identified in the existing literature. To assess computational costs among the three schemes, we define time-consuming operation symbols, including the bilinear pairing operation (\(OP\)) and exponentiation operations (\(OE\)). Based on the above information, we can infer that our scheme facilitates access control without introducing additional storage and computational overhead. However, further verification of this fact is necessary. In healthcare systems, access control mechanisms must strike a balance between preserving patient privacy and ensuring rapid data availability, particularly during mission-critical situations such as medical emergencies, natural disasters, or rapid administrative changes in user roles. Traditional Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) offers a robust fine-grained access control paradigm, yet it exhibits inherent limitations in handling exceptional access requirements and dynamically revoking privileges. The proposed EHRChain framework addresses these challenges by incorporating advanced extensions to the baseline ABE model, specifically to support: Revocation of access rights – removing user privileges promptly when their authorization status changes or security risks are detected. Under conventional ABE, decryption is rigidly policy-bound: if a user attribute set does not match the embedded access policy, access is unequivocally denied. While this ensures strict adherence to predefined policies, it can hinder timely interventions in acute medical emergencies, where treating physicians or authorized responders may require immediate access to life-critical patient data. This attribute is issued by a designated authority, such as a hospital administrator, security officer, or a smart contract-governed trust entity, following the verification of emergency conditions. Time-bound validity: Emergency access credentials are embedded with cryptographically enforced expiration timestamps, automatically revoking privileges after the predefined duration (e.g., 30 minutes to 2 hours), thereby preventing prolonged or unmonitored access. Scope-limited access: Emergency attributes are strictly bound to relevant datasets or patient records associated with the ongoing critical event, minimizing unnecessary data exposure. Immutable on-chain auditability: Each emergency access request, approval, and usage instance is permanently recorded in the blockchain ledger, enabling post-incident forensic analysis, regulatory compliance verification, and deterrence against misuse. Multi-factor verification: Prior to attribute issuance, an additional verification layer–such as biometric confirmation or secondary authorization from another administrator–can be enforced to strengthen trust in the emergency request. This design ensures that emergency access is operationally efficient while preserving the overarching privacy and compliance guarantees of the system. Access revocation presents a well-documented challenge in traditional ABE systems, as the attribute–ciphertext relationship is static and re-encryption typically requires system-wide re-keying. In healthcare settings, where staff assignments, operational roles, and trust statuses can change frequently, this limitation can result in security risks if not addressed effectively. To overcome this, EHRChain incorporates a dual-layered revocation strategy: Expiration-based key validity: All attribute keys are issued with cryptographically embedded expiration timestamps. Users must periodically request renewed keys, which are only issued if their current role and authorization remain valid, thereby automatically removing access for inactive or reassigned personnel. Proxy-assisted re-encryption: Upon the occurrence of a revocation event, such as role reassignment, employment termination, or detected key compromise, a trusted proxy entity (e.g., a hospital blockchain node) re-encrypts affected ciphertexts using updated access policies. This ensures that previously valid credentials cannot be used to decrypt data post-revocation, without necessitating full re-keying of the entire user base. The integration of proxy-assisted re-encryption provides a scalable and resource-efficient mechanism for dynamic policy enforcement, essential for large-scale healthcare deployments. The practical realization of the proposed EHRChain framework is grounded in healthcare-specific regulatory, operational, and compliance imperatives, ensuring its suitability for deployment in real-world clinical environments. The framework adopts a permissioned blockchain architecture in conjunction with a consortium-governed IPFS network, enabling authenticated participation within a secure and controlled trust domain. This design not only mitigates the risk of unauthorized node inclusion but also inherently satisfies the stringent privacy, security, and accountability requirements associated with the management of sensitive electronic health information. From a regulatory perspective, EHRChain is architected to align with internationally recognized compliance regimes, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the United States, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union, and established interoperability specifications such as HL7 and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). Conformance with these standards is achieved through the integration of Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) for fine-grained, policy-driven access control; immutable blockchain-anchored transaction logs for verifiable auditability; and the off-chain storage of encrypted EHR data within IPFS to prevent unauthorized data disclosure. Collectively, these mechanisms safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of medical records while supporting comprehensive compliance auditing. Operational viability is reinforced through the modular and standards-compliant architecture of the framework, which facilitates seamless integration with existing Hospital Information Systems (HIS) and Regional Health Information Exchanges (HIE) without necessitating disruptive infrastructure replacement. This integration model reduces deployment complexity and cost while preserving continuity of care and existing clinical workflows. Furthermore, as demonstrated in “Scalability and latency analysis of the EHRChain framework”, empirical performance evaluations confirm that EHRChain sustains high throughput and low latency transaction processing under varying concurrent user loads, validating its scalability and robustness for large-scale healthcare ecosystems. In addition, governance policies embedded within the permissioned network enforce role-based participation, transaction validation rules, and jurisdiction-specific compliance constraints. These measures ensure that deployment across multiple healthcare organizations can be tailored to local regulatory requirements while maintaining interoperability across the broader ecosystem. As such, EHRChain not only offers a technically robust solution but also demonstrates regulatory and operational readiness for secure, scalable, and privacy-preserving electronic health record management in diverse healthcare settings. This research presents a comprehensive evaluation of a novel framework aimed at enhancing the security and efficiency of blockchain-based medical record management systems. Utilizing Ethereum smart contracts and detailed transaction payload analysis, the study explores various aspects of performance, including execution time, latency, and throughput. Our findings indicate that the proposed framework offers substantial improvements over existing methods. Through rigorous testing using tools like Remix, Metamask, and the Rinkeby test network, we have shown that the framework can handle complex transactions with improved speed and reduced delays. The detailed analysis of transaction payloads and their encoding demonstrates the robustness and scalability of our approach, ensuring that the system can support a high volume of transactions while maintaining security and integrity. Furthermore, the study provides insights into the costs associated with Ethereum transactions, offering a clear understanding of the economic implications of deploying such a framework in real-world scenarios. The research introduces a robust framework to enhance the security and efficiency of blockchain-based medical record management systems, showcasing significant performance improvements in execution time, latency, and throughput. Future work will address this by focusing on implementing attribute revocation functions for better access control, integrating smart contracts to enhance data functionality, exploring advanced cryptographic techniques for improved security, investigating interoperability with other blockchain platforms, optimizing gas consumption for cost-effectiveness, developing dynamic access control algorithms, and conducting real-world implementation and testing in healthcare environments to validate the practical utility of the framework and identify potential challenges. Future studies could also delve into optimizing the gas consumption and transaction fees associated with Ethereum, making the framework more cost-effective for large-scale deployments. Another potential direction is the development of more sophisticated algorithms for dynamic access control, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific medical records based on evolving policies and user roles. Finally, real-world implementation and testing in healthcare environments will be crucial to validate the framework's practical utility and identify any additional challenges that may arise in a production setting. These future efforts will help in refining the framework, making it a viable solution for secure and efficient medical record management on the blockchain.
