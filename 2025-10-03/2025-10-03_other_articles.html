                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The majority of people have experienced a psychic phenomenon, according to new research. Here's what those strange “gut feelings” could actually mean. For years, villagers had raised concerns about the coal waste heaps perched above their homes. A new study by psychologist Olafur S. Palsson, PhD, suggests that so-called anomalous experiences—events that seem to go beyond what conventional science can explain—are not rare, but in fact quite common. Additionally, people who report experiencing premonitions, déjà vu, superstitious intuition, and out-of-body sensations often share distinct psychological attributes. These “strange-but-true” perceptions correlate strongly with a cognitive trait Palsson terms subconscious connectedness: the degree of interaction between conscious awareness and subconscious thought. The research, published in the peer-reviewed journal Psychology of Consciousness: Theory, Research, and Practice, found that individuals high in subconscious connectedness were significantly more likely to report frequent anomalous experiences, including: “Some people have a much closer connection with the non-conscious or subconscious parts of their mind,” said Palsson, professor emeritus at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “Their consciousness and subconscious mind influence each other to an unusually high degree in everyday life.” Using a newly developed metric called the Thought Impact Scale, Palsson surveyed more than 2,000 adults in the U.S. to assess “interactions between conscious aware thinking and nonconscious mental functions.” Respondents rate how much they agree with statements (on a Likert scale) about their various mental experiences and psychological traits, including automatic thoughts, intuitive insight, emotional resonance, spontaneous mental imagery, as well as the frequency of unusual experiences such as telepathic impressions, precognitive dreams, and uncanny coincidences. A clear pattern emerged: individuals with high subconscious connectedness reported such experiences far more often than those with low scores. What changes, Palsson suggests, is how the trait manifests—the ways in which people interpret intuition, memory, or coincidence. For those with stronger subconscious input, the mind may simply register more of what others discard, Palsson suggests. “Anomalous experiences are something most people have at least occasionally,” says Palsson. Neuroscientists suggest that the brain's default mode network—active during daydreaming and introspection—may play a role in generating these impressions. Heightened connectivity between regions of the brain responsible for memory, emotion, and prediction could explain the intensity or vividness of so-called premonitions.” Might psychic foresight, hunches, or “gut feelings” confer some sort of evolutionary edge? Or, perhaps premonitions and uncanny experiences point to something more banal: they might be explained by selective recall (remembering accurate predictions while ignoring those that never came true). One-hundred dreams are forgotten; the one that coincides with tragedy becomes unforgettable.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Streaming platforms are still a contentious subject for creatives in the entertainment industry and audiences alike, but one benefit is undeniable — the accessibility of a streaming library allows people to discover shows and movies they may have missed out on when they first debuted. It used to be that people would discover their new favorite after browsing video store shelves, catching a stray rerun on cable, or having an older cousin introduce them to something cool from before their time. If you were lucky enough to come of age with the internet, forum discussions, lists published on your favorite online publication (like /Film! ), or the omnipotent Tumblr gifset were methods of cultural sharing that allowed strangers to connect with one another over a shared love of film and television. Recently, the Netflix animated fantasy horror series "Dead End: Paranormal Park," which was canceled two years ago, has been rediscovered by some people whose only knowledge of the show is some out-of-context clips. The supernatural series centers on Barney (Zach Barack) and Norma (Kody Kavitha), two teenagers who are hired to work at Phoenix Parks, a haunted Dollywood-esque theme park created by the famous Pauline Phoenix (Coco Peru). They're joined by Barney's childhood pup Puglsey (Alex Brightman) and Courtney (Emily Osment), the park's resident 1,000-year-old demon. "Dead End: Paranormal Park" boasts some seriously dazzling animation, with charming characters presented in vibrant colors and rounded shapes like Steele's graphic novel come to life. Even with haunted mascots, demonic game shows, and a musical episode, the series transports viewers to a fantastical place, but with relatable messages about learning to understand yourself. Nothing about their identities is presented as a plot twist or surprise reveal; it's simply the reality of who they are. There are also characters like the extroverted and optimistic Badyah Hassan (Kathreen Khavari), who wears a hijab, and Barney's crush, Logan "Logs" Nguyen, who often uses puns to diffuse awkward tension. The show isn't about their marginalized identities, but it also doesn't pretend that their identities have no impact on the way they navigate life. In today's day and age, this shouldn't be revolutionary, but in a world where anti-LGBTQIA+ rhetoric is gaining terrifying ground, especially the kind targeting trans youth, it is. "Dead End: Paranormal Park" lets Barney be a teenager first: awkward, hopeful, and unsure of himself as he navigates crushes, friendship, and finding where he belongs. He explains that this haunted theme park, of all places, is where he's finally felt safe enough to just be — to embrace on his own terms when and how to share who he is, because the people in his life aren't always as affirming. Seeing Barney, a trans teen, express this in an animated series is especially meaningful — mainstream animation seldom explores characters like this with such depth and care, although we've seen great progress with shows like "The Great North" and "The Owl House," as well as movies like "Nimona," just to name a few. Meanwhile, Norma is constantly learning how to step outside of her comfort zone, working on her social anxiety, and allowing herself to be a part of a community. As an autistic character, she sometimes gets overstimulated or can be a little blunt, but the show doesn't look down on her for processing the world differently. The show loves both of these characters exactly as they are, and it only wants what's best for them. It's impossible to be the weirdest person at a park that features demons, witches, ghosts, night hags, and phantoms, which means any kid watching at home can see that they're not "weird" for being themselves, either.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For the first time, scientists have detected trace amounts of phosphine in the atmosphere of a brown dwarf—a molecule that, on Earth, is produced only by living beings. Wolf 1130C is an ancient brown dwarf located in the constellation Cygnus. Brown dwarfs like Wolf 1130C aren't planets or stars, though they have features of both. Previous research suggests that brown dwarfs should contain phosphine—which forms when phosphorus combines with hydrogen—given the conditions of their atmospheres. But past observers failed to find a significant amount of the molecule anywhere, puzzling scientists. That doesn't mean there's life on Wolf 1130C, the authors stress—and brown dwarfs are not expected to be hospitable for organisms as we know them. In 1975, astronomer Jill Tarter coined a name for the objects she called “faint wannabe stars”: brown dwarfs. Their existence wouldn't be confirmed until around two decades later. Wolf's neighboring white dwarf may have undergone nuclear reactions that created phosphorus, explains Burgasser in the statement. All this uncertainty could mean that using phosphine as a biosignature is actually flawed—and the results may force researchers to reconsider their chemical models. More research may be needed to understand the molecule before treating it as a possible signal for life, as researchers did when they found it on Venus in 2020. “The new data really demonstrates that we don't fully understand PH3 (phosphine) chemical networks in the context of atmospheres, so it is premature to rely on PH3 as a biosignature,” writes Mark S. Marley, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona who did not participate in the research, in an email to Fionna Samuels at Chemical & Engineering News. But a better understanding of phosphine and phosphorus synthesis could help researchers better understand the galaxy, too—perhaps yielding insights that could assist in the ongoing search for life outside Earth. “Understanding phosphine chemistry in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs, where we don't expect life, is crucial if we hope to use this molecule in the search for life on terrestrial worlds beyond our solar system,” Burgasser says in the statement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Far-right activist Jack Posobiec is known for peddling conspiracy theories about the integrity of recent elections particularly in Pennsylvania. Now, Posobiec, an outspoken MAGA booster best known for promoting the debunked “Pizzagate” conspiracy, is at the center of an investigative report showing that he is a Maryland resident who has been voting fraudulently in Pennsylvania elections. A report by Slate, found that Posobiec, who helped amplify the “Stop the Steal” movement in 2020, has been voting in Montgomery County, Pa. for a number of election cycles, even as he was a Maryland resident. The report points to “extremely strong” evidence that Posobiec lives in Maryland, including public records such as a divorce filing, and most damning, Federal Election Commission filings showing his political contributions associated with a Maryland address. Slate also perused Posobiec's prolific social media accounts, where he repeatedly boasts about his home and family life in Maryland; last fall, he even posted on X a photo of his Pennsylvania ballot marked up. Vote Early, Pennsylvania!” he wrote on the post, which was accompanied by two photos of him, including his marked up ballot. In an interview with PennLive, Pennsylvania election law expert and attorney Adam Bonin laid out why Posobiec's voting record could be a crime. In its investigation, Slate found that Posobiec used military and civilian overseas ballots until 2016. He continued voting in Pennsylvania via absentee ballots and, later, in-person on-demand mail voting, using his parents' home address in 2018, 2022, and 2024, according to an official copy of his voter information file from Montgomery County obtained through a right-to-know request. Posobiec has aligned himself with far-right groups such as Charlie Kirk's Turning Point USA and was the mastermind behind the “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory, which claimed that Democratic politicians were engaged in runnning a pedophile ring out of a Washington, D.C. pizza restaurant. But Posobiec, known for his vicious trolling of political adversaries online, cemented his status as a social media influencer pushing a slew of conspiracy theories about how Democrats, including former President Joe Biden, won elections with millions of fraudulent votes. Posobiec notably helped get traction on election fraud conspiracies. The Republican National Committee last year filed a lawsuit against Montgomery County, a Philadelphia suburb, claiming the county had failed to ensure election integrity. “Why are you sending out illegal mail-in ballots, Neil?” Posobiec posted on X in October, directing his trolling to county commissioner Neil Makhija. “Petitioners have failed to produce any evidence that Montgomery County's process was unlawful or inaccurate,” Judge Richard P. Haaz opined, rejecting the RNC's claims. Josh Shapiro of “disenfranchising” voters and echoed Trump's stolen election claims with social media posts about Pennsylvania counties processing thousands of fraudulent voter registrations. “There's this line that we sometimes say in politics, every accusation is a confession,” he said. I mean, this based on the facts....This is someone who has not lived in Pennsylvania in quite some time under any reasonable understanding of the law here.” Posobiec would not be the first conservative to seemingly violate election law, even as they espoused debunked theories about fraudulent Democratic votes. In 2022, Matt Mowers, a former senior adviser for President Trump, was caught having voted twice during the 2016 primary election. Mowers, at the time a New Hampshire Republican congressional candidate, cast an absentee ballot in that state, and then used his parents' address in New Jersey to vote in that state as well, the Associated Press reported. While Mowers' actions seemed to have violated federal election law, he was not prosecuted. “Let's be absolutely clear, voter fraud is incredibly rare,” Bonin said. “You only see it in rare circumstances and most of what we've seen is people trying to cast mail-in ballots for recently deceased relatives. Double voting is also pretty rare and people do tend to get caught because whether you voted is a matter of public record. It's harder to catch a single person who is voting in a different state without being qualified there because you really need people to know about it and investigate it like these great reporters have.” Posobiec has not been charged with any violation of voting laws. The county DA's office told Slate it did not comment on active investigations. Sunday's office would neither confirm nor deny that it had opened an investigation. The Slate report was undertaken by independent investigative reporter, Jacqueline Sweet, and journalist Marisa Kabas, who launched the Handbasket, an independent political news publication.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Candace Owens and Tucker Carlson are at the forefront of alternative media, grabbing more eyeballs than ever, but also wrecking the emerging medium's credibility with loony conspiracy theories that are easily debunked. The divergence between the fact-based podcasts, like The Daily and WSJ, and what Owens and Carlson are peddling on their shows has never been further apart, ensuring that Americans are living in dangerously different realities. In the weeks since Charlie Kirk's horrific murder, Owens has unabashedly pushed conspiracy theory after conspiracy theory, claiming everything from a federal cover-up, to there being a female accomplice, to suggesting his assassination was connected to Jewish and pro-Israel forces being angry with him. Carlson, too, has been out with outlandish claim after outlandish claim, including his most recent claim that Israeli military officials were “demanding” U.S. military officials inside the Pentagon do as they say during the recent Israel-Iran conflict. Carlson, since his days at Fox News, has long been famous for “just asking questions,” and has made claim after claim over the years that have proven not to be the case. Owens famously said in March of 2024, “ I would stake my entire professional reputation on the fact that [French First Lady] Brigitte Macron is in fact a man.” The Macrons are now suing Owens in a 22-count defamation lawsuit. Independent journalist Nathan Livignstone put together a short clip of Carlson and Owens pushing some of their recent conspiracy theories and wrote: Clearly, they tune into them for something other than facts. While their approach certainly is working for them, Owens and Carlson are doing untold damage to both the country and the credibility of alternative media. To be fair, many on the right have already tired of Owens's antics. The MAGA influencer known as Catturd posted on Thursday, “Candace Owens is just a few days away of blaming Charlie Kirk's assassination on Kermit the Frog. Others, however, remain willfully blind in the name of partisanship. Too f*cking bad,” Kelly told a podcast this week on the topic, adding, “I don't think he's an anti-Semite at all. She later added, “ I think Tucker's a very important, valuable voice in the national conversation.” Carlson, who is also out right now with a 9/11 truther documentary, has jumped further and further off the rails in recent months – going so far as to claim he was physically attacked by a demon. RedState columnist Bonchie highlighted one of Carlson's recent interview subjects, Elizabeth Lane, noting, “She has 3.3K followers. So naturally, she gets an interview on Tucker Carlson's show. With Owens and Carlson leading the alternative media revolution, they have turned what could have been a journalistic project to speak truth to power into an entertainment-based grift, feeding into the worst impulses of American media consumers and sowing further division and hate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The airship-like S1500, the world's largest flying wind turbine, recently became the first device of its kind to generate one megawatt of power during a test flight. Wind turbines are already a big part of China's big bet on renewable green energy, but the Asian country is always looking to lower the cost and increase the efficiency of its installations. That's how it came up with a versatile inflatable turbine capable of being relocated quickly while generating significant amounts of electricity. It looks like a giant floating airplane engine and it is capable of operating at heights of up to 1,500 meters, where winds are faster and more stable than at the level of traditional towers (approximately 200 meters). Developed by Beijing Linyi Yunchuan Energy Technology Co. Ltd., the world's largest flying wind turbine features a main helium-filled gasbag with a ring wing, which forms a giant duct that harnesses the stable high-altitude winds to drive the rotor. With the help of 12 generators rated at 100 kilowatt, the ingenious power-generating system transmits electricity steadily to the ground through tethering cables. One of the main advantages of lying turbines is that they don't require the construction of large metal towers and rotors, which can reduce the cost per kilowatt-hour by 30%. The inflatable design also makes them extremely easy to move across long distances. Beijing Linyi Yunchuan Energy Technology Co. Ltd. plans to begin mass producing S1500 wind turbines starting next year, but there are still challenges to overcome, such as regulatory frameworks and safety standards, demonstrating the stability of the installation in extreme weather conditions, and the durability of its components. “We look forward to making airborne wind power an important component of affordable green electricity,” Dun Tianrui, CEO of eijing Linyi Yunchuan Energy Technology Co. Ltd., said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many staff members believe a few highly active ghosts haunt the distillery at 624 W. Main St. in Louisville. At one point, Buzzard Roost's resident basement ghost “Gandano” may even select which bourbon is tried next. What I can tell you, though, is that some very curious things have happened on the 600 block of W. Main Street in downtown Louisville. Ryan Svab, who co-owns Hereafter, also bartends at Buzzard's Roost. When the distillery teamed up with Fen Alankus of Feralore and her paranormal investigative team for a two-night investigation, it made sense to do one at Hereafter, as well. Two centuries ago, the 600 block of W. Main Street was Louisville's hub for commerce. Local lore says the upstairs mezzanine at Hereafter was once a Civil War map room. Five firefighters died that day, and Alankus' team believes they've connected with two of them, “Captain Edward” and “John.” A couple of years after the fire, a tornado blew through and took out the north side of the street. That kind of history and devastation can be fertile ground for paranormal investigations. “There's certain parts of the building where you just feel like you're not alone,” Coomes told me ahead of the tour. As Coomes, Svab and Alankus carved out this experience, they knew they wanted to do more than tell ghost stories. They wanted to give their guests a chance to interact with the ghosts and decide for themselves whether they believed anything supernatural was there. “There's no guarantees of what you're going to see and experience, because we think it's going to be different every single time,” Coomes told me. “Even though we've planned it out, every person is going to have a different type of time." Beyond me, only two couples from Pennsylvania, who knew each other, had signed up for it. We started the tour in the still room where Buzzard's Roost brand ambassador Jimmy James Hamblin offered us a pour of whiskey, while Alankus and Coomes talked us through the building's history. Since Buzzard's Roost opened in 2023, the staff has experienced unexplained broken glasses, books falling off the shelf and many elevator and electronic glitches. Coomes has seen unexplained orbs fluttering in upstairs offices on the security cameras. Bartenders hear footsteps when they're alone, only to discover no one is there. Hamblin doesn't believe in ghosts, but he also doesn't have an explanation for the books he's seen fall around him. There, the paranormal investigators played us a recording of an unexplained noise they captured in this room during their investigation. In the middle of hours worth of silence, the recorder picked up what could be a muffled man's voice saying “dimes.” Then Alankus introduced us to “Gandano,” who had previously told her this nickname using a Ouija board. She held up a pendulum from which she showed our group how to use it to channel answers from beyond. In theory, you could use these yes or no questions to learn about his life and preferences. Or, you could use it to choose what type of Buzzard's Roost bourbon we should drink. “Are you cool with choosing the whiskey that we're going to try first,” Alankus asked him. The pendulum swung in a small circle near Buzzard's Roost's smoked barrel rye whiskey, which has previously won a double gold medal at the San Francisco World Spirits competition. Hamblin served the blended three-year-old rye finished in toasted barrel, which had a smooth, almost vanilla taste. As we sipped on that, Alankus showed us a pair of divining rods. Like the pendulum, Alankus explained that the position of these L-shaped rods could be used to answer yes or no questions. After a short test, we learned that when the rods swung apart, Gandano was saying “no” and if they crossed, it meant “yes.” And this is where the real fun began. So much so, eventually Hamblin ended up choosing the second and third pours of whiskey for us, instead of Gandano. Our little group was having too much fun trying to learn about the spirit to give him another shot at selecting a bourbon. “Gandano are you Italian,” one woman asked, and the rods positioned themselves into a “no.” This kind of banter went on for about 25 minutes, until finally it was time to head around the corner to Hereafter. “I would like to know if Gandano enjoyed himself this evening,” Hamblin asked, playfully. Whether or not we were speaking to the dead ― at very least we hadn't ticked this supposed spirit off. The paranormal team had set out stacks of tarot cards. Each card had a corresponding cocktail that went with it, which left the final drink of the night in fate's hands. Hereafter is one of the most active spaces Alankus has ever investigated. Co-owner Svab and some of her staff believe they've seen a male apparition in a dark work suit roaming the building. They worried someone might be in trouble inside, and then when the staff finally got the door open — no one was there. As we sipped our fortune cocktails, the team passed around a collection of sensors designed to detect electro-magnetic energy or unexplained changes in temperatures. They encouraged us to wander the bar and music venue to see if any of the decor might seem sensitive. Svab keeps a “cabinet of curiosities” filled with creepy dolls and bizarre antiques in the downstairs bar, and she said many of the objects seem to have a supernatural charge to them. She has several bubble portraits from the 1800s decorating the walls that her staff suspects might have a spirit connected to them. But really, most of the supernatural activity at Hereafter occurs when the building is quiet and only one or two people are there. So then the woman tried calling out to other significant names in her life. I was just about to put my sensor down and call it a night when conversation in the group turned back to those red-headed, mischievous, 20-somethings. “And I'm observing, and I'm watching what's going around, what would be my motivation to throw a picture or to mess with people?" Right as she said “mess with people” every light on my sensor went off, as though that was the answer. And candidly, that was enough to convince me it was time to call it a night and explore the spirits downtairs behind the bar ... rather than tempt these red heads into "messing" with me from the afterlife.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Horror enthusiasts and Final Destination loyalists have reason to celebrate once again. After thrilling audiences worldwide with its spine-chilling scenes and record-breaking box office performance, Final Destination: Bloodlines is all set to make its OTT debut in India. Final Destination: Bloodlines streaming 16th October onwards in English, Hindi, Tamil and Telugu only on JioHotstar.” The announcement has left fans buzzing with excitement as they prepare to revisit the franchise that has defined horror for decades. About Final Destination: BloodlinesDirected by Zach Lipovsky and Adam Stein from a screenplay by Guy Busick and Lori Evans Taylor, the film stars Kaitlyn Santa Juana, Teo Briones, Richard Harmon, Owen Patrick Joyner, Anna Lore, Brec Bassinger, and Tony Todd in key roles. The story follows college student Stefani Reyes, who inherits haunting visions of a 1968 premonition that prevented a deadly skyscraper collapse from her dying grandmother, Iris. Upon release, Final Destination: Bloodlines received overwhelming praise from both critics and audiences, quickly becoming the most successful film in the franchise. The campy feel, which horror lost a decade ago, is what makes it great. From references to horror tropes to hilarious red herrings and some clever jokes, the humour of the film is macabre but never sick. Yet, you may find yourself questioning your own morality the fifth time you chuckle or marvel as a character meets a gruesome demise. But then that is the beauty of this franchise. And it has never looked more stunning than in Bloodlines.” Directed by Zach Lipovsky and Adam Stein from a screenplay by Guy Busick and Lori Evans Taylor, the film stars Kaitlyn Santa Juana, Teo Briones, Richard Harmon, Owen Patrick Joyner, Anna Lore, Brec Bassinger, and Tony Todd in key roles.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The weekend before last, I was asked to stand in memory of Charlie Kirk. I was not inside the more than 63,000-seater State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, where Kirk's official memorial ceremony took place. He spent the rest of his speech ranting about the threats posed by Muslims who, in his telling, want to “change” Irish society in their image. Carroll, who did not respond to a request for comment, was one of more than 20 speakers at the Rebels Across the Pond conference, a gathering designed to strengthen ties between conspiracists and far-right extremists on either side of the Atlantic. Carroll was one of many speakers who invoked Kirk's name during the event. Another was Eddie Hobbs, a former prominent TV presenter in Ireland who in recent years has launched a YouTube channel that flirts with conspiracy theories and now views his former employers as enemy number one. “My job is to go for the jugular against the Irish media on my channel, and I will do that until or unless I end up like Charlie Kirk,” Hobbs told the audience, which then pleaded with him to run for political office. Boyle is an idyllic town of just 3,000 people in County Roscommon, best known for being the birthplace of Bridesmaids and Black Mirror actor Chris O'Dowd. But since 2017 it has also been the home of Mark Attwood, an Englishman who in 2023 established Live 5D Health, which its website describes as “a private members holistic wellness club,” in the town. In addition to mainstream services like saunas and steam rooms, the club offers more esoteric services such as the Orynoco Healing Pod, described on the club's website as being powered by “quantum healing we can't really explain.” Attwood is a well-known figure in the online conspiracy world, running a popular video podcast series and Substack where he covers everything from QAnon to the threat that demons pose in your everyday life. The location for the event, which was kept secret over concerns about protesters showing up, turned out to be a venue normally used as a roofed beer garden and music venue for a local pub on the banks of the River Boyle, just a few minutes away from Live 5D Health. Previously, one local told me, it was among other things the location for a professional chainsaw workshop. I spoke to Louis Sexton, who was selling black stone medallions under the Atlantis Round Towers of Eire brand. One woman next to me quickly handed over €150 ($180) for three medallions. The attendees were split pretty evenly between men and women, and while the average age was certainly over 50, there were a couple of dozen in their twenties. Also on the stage was a device purportedly emitting scalar waves, in line with an unproven pseudoscientific concept that suggests invisible energy can help heal a variety of ailments. Attwood opened the conference by talking about his own experiences with demonic forces, including a claim that while he was in his kitchen chopping vegetables, someone beamed a voice into his head using “voice to skull” technology that instructed him to “kill your children.” Jana Lunden, an anti-trans activist from America now living in Ireland, said “the tsunami of what is happening in America is coming over to Ireland.” Lunden said that they had discussed her heading up an Irish chapter of an international women's movement and added that she would be traveling to Washington, DC—where, she said, she would “hopefully” not need a bulletproof vest. He told the audience that “God has chosen me for this battle” and that he won't stop until “every indigenous man, woman, and innocent Irish child in this country truly knows the meaning of the word freedom.” He failed to mention that the conference was being organized by a man from England and that the previous speaker was an American living in Ireland. At this point, the event was briefly disrupted by a small protest outside by two local activists who highlighted the fact that Attwood had been advocating a toxic bleach solution to his followers. Power and fellow far-right activist Philip Dwyer confronted the two protesters and questioned if they were trying to get Attwood killed, just like Kirk. Dwyer declined to answer WIRED's questions about his comments but called this reporter a “communist left-wing radical.” Back inside, Attwood laughed off the protesters, with one later speaker calling them “clones.” Finally, after mystic Honey C Golden had informed everyone that “The Matrix was a reality show” and that she doesn't “really believe in time,” it was time for Lewis Herms, a fringe candidate for California governor, to take the stage. While Herms has decided not to employ a campaign manager—because it would not be authentic—he did claim that he is working with some other people. “I'm very proud to say a lot of RFK Jr.'s team is already working with us,” Herms said. “And they already label our team Super MAHA because we're looking for different modalities that we can bring back to California and bring to a whole other level than he's even doing it right now.” Herms and Kennedy did not respond to requests for comment. Herms received a standing ovation at the end of his nearly 45-minute speech despite the fact that most people were, at this point, very cold. Morigeau proceeded to pull half a dozen different cards and very quickly concluded that the person seen on camera being shot was not actually Kirk at all. “Whatever they were doing there was likely a white hat op, because it's to the benefit of humanity,” Morigeau said before adding mysteriously: “I don't know if even the real Charlie Kirk was who we thought he was.” In your inbox: Our biggest stories, handpicked for you each day WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

BANGOR -- The city of Bangor certainly has no shortage of history, but it also has no shortage of spooky stories. The Bangor Historical Society merges both of those in their ghostly walking tours every October.

Tour host and historical society manager Matt Bishop has been hosting these spooky strolls for well over a decade every October. Thursday was the first one of 2025.

Bishop says he hasn't seen a spirit in his time in Bangor yet, but he says leading these journeys is a great way to educate locals on both the history and the haunts.

"You just have the energies of the areas and especially when you hear what happened there, you kind of get the hair to stand on the back of your neck a little bit, and those energies still do speak to us today," shared Bishop. "These tours are really one of those things we look forward to every year...really seeing the city at a beautiful time of year and incorporating the spooky aspects."

To find out more of Bangor's paranormal past, watch above! To book your own tour or learn more, contact the Bangor Historical Society.

Penn's Sung Robotics Lab is working with NASA to lead an initiative investigating how robots can explore and navigate extraterrestrial environments. The project, titled “Temporarily, Robots Unite to Surmount Sandy Entrapments, then Separate," is led by School of Engineering and Applied Sciences researchers from the General Robotics, Automation, Sensing & Perception Lab in partnership with NASA and researchers from other universities. Their research centers around a multi-robot system that allows the robots to physically connect, pulling and pushing each other to overcome environmental hazards. Engineering professor and principal lead Cynthia Sung said that a goal of the project is to create a robot that can successfully interact with lunar surfaces. “We aim to design systems that perform real-world tasks as best as possible,” Sung told Penn Engineering Today. “To do this, we have to build the complexity of the environment into the model as well as find ways where our work in soft robotics' interactions applies to hard robots traversing soft, sandy terrain.” Penn ModLab researchers complete next phase of human-robot interaction project Penn researchers to expand student team for work on NASA space telescope project “By relying on multiple individual robots instead of one, we create a more robust system aligned with NASA's current robotic infrastructure,” Sung added. “If one robot fails, the system can still function. That wouldn't be the case if we just designed one robot that could do all the jobs needed.” The project's website explains that a priority is to have “heterogeneous teams of ground robots” so that “each robot interacts differently with the terrain, offering unique capabilities in team operations.” With such a diverse team of robots, the robots can divide tastes and explore difficult environments, making lunar and Martian missions more feasible.

During their field testing, researchers observed that the robots connected together and were able to climb up about 2.5 meters up the sand dunes. The team described this as a “big success” as it showed how the multi-robot systems could handle environments currently off-limits to single rovers. “We're a little nervous, sure,” project researcher and sixth-year Engineering Ph.D. candidate Shivangi Misra said to Penn Engineering Today.
