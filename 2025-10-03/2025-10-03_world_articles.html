                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New York Yankees' Aaron Judge talks with Toronto Blue Jays first baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. during a game in the Bronx last month.Adam Hunger/The Associated Press When Yankees broadcaster and professional loudmouth Michael Kay ripped the Blue Jays in July, it wasn't what he said. What Kay said made a sort of sense – that the Jays, who were in first place, weren't a first-place team based on their run differential. Baseball nerds have this discussion all the time. It was the sneer in his voice. I don't even want to think about what they'd say after a couple of beers about the rest of Canada. Anybody who's followed Toronto sports for a while knows it's not worth hating New York teams, because they won't hate you back. He may also be the sweetest guy I've ever met in baseball. In Depth: The Blue Jays' year started out rocky. In his debut that year – a meaningless late-May encounter with the Yankees – then-New York star Alex Rodriguez decided to yank his chain. Jorge Posada popped a two-out pitch up in the infield. As he ran past, Rodriguez yelled something. Jays players later said it sounded like, “Mine.” Clark thought he was being called off. The only purpose of Rodriguez's shout – he later said he'd yelled “Ha,” which doesn't make it any better – was to humiliate Clark. Had he done it to an all-star in a game that mattered, it would have still been an awful abrogation of fair play. Gibbons was a yeller, but he rarely got genuinely angry. He couldn't believe someone so high on the baseball ladder had done that to someone so much further down. That incident expressed better than any “they got a great team over there” quote how the Yankees actually felt about the Jays. This summer, Kay reminded everyone that things haven't changed. That's what people were reacting to. Even his apology reeked of noblesse oblige. He made excuses, then he ripped Sportsnet broadcaster Jamie Campbell for waving a broom after Toronto swept New York. Yankees broadcaster Michael Kay was unhappy with the way Blue Jays broadcaster Jamie Campbell celebrated a series sweep earlier this year.Duane Cole/The Globe and Mail It is a cosmopolitan city,” Kay said. You're turning it into Mayberry RFD.” (I had to look that one up. Maybe they watch a lot of TV Land in the Bronx.) Why do all set-tos between Canadians and Americans feel like the weaponization of our national reputation for niceness? I feel terrible about that, loser.” Maybe that's part of it, too. If you're feeling good about your prospects in a fight, it's hard to take your opponent seriously until they've hurt you. The Jays couldn't snatch from them something they weren't capable of grabbing in the first place. Now, 50 years in, they have that chance. I make it a practice not to care who wins what game when, but it would be fun to watch the Jays stomp the Yankees at 161st Street. Gausman set to take the mound for Blue Jays' playoff opener As the Blue Jays head to the playoffs, a new turn in our family baseball drama I'm pretty sure that wouldn't make much of an impression. A one-off, New York would tell itself. Then I'd like to see Toronto do it again. And maybe one more season after that. This is the only bright spot to wild-card expansion. It makes it theoretically possible that right now, Toronto can break New York's (and Boston's) heart for a generation. Not just because it can never happen, but because it's a perversion of how rivalry works. Let's face it – Calgary is Edmonton with bigger belt buckles; Toronto is Montreal with a different accent. That people will read this and be angry about it proves my point. New Yorkers don't know anything about us. They know it's cheaper up here, and that you don't go broke if you fall off a ladder and need to go to the E.R. Some blah blah about multiculturalism, and isn't this where Drake has that big, ugly house? Not everyone is meant to be your best pal. But you draw the line at a lack of respect. There's no call for that sort of thing. You don't earn respect from someone who's not willing to give it. In this case, you do that one baseball humiliation at a time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US treasurer says officials looking at drafts for country's 250th anniversary featuring president with raised fist The words overtly reference what Trump said immediately after narrowly surviving an assassination attempt four months before he won a second presidency. US treasurer Brandon Beach effectively announced a draft design of the coin Friday on X, saying: “No fake news here. One side of the coin on whose draft design Beach commented Friday showed Trump's profile alongside “Liberty”, “In God we Trust”, and “1776-2026”. The other side referenced the attempt on Trump's life at a political rally in Pennsylvania last year, when authorities said a sniper injured Trump's right ear and wounded two others before being shot to death by the US Secret Service. Trump raised his fist after the attack – one of two attempted assassinations for him as he successfully ran for a second Oval Office term in 2024 – and shouted, “Fight! A statement from a treasury department spokesperson to Politico said the draft which Beach's X post discussed was not the “final $1 coin design”. Trump's approval rating on average has plummeted to -9.5%, as his second administration has cut healthcare protections and nutrition assistance that benefits the poor – while also implementing tariffs that preceded a reported rise in consumer prices. A poll of 3,445 US adults taken by Pew Research between 22 and 28 September showed 53% believed Trump had made the national economy worse. Among other things, the Trump administration has also deployed US military troops into the streets of multiple cities, axed roughly half a billion dollars in funding for vaccines such as the ones that helped end the Covid pandemic, and struggled to contain a scandal over his past friendship with late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Palestinian militant group accepts part of US president's plan but seeks further negotiations on many terms Donald Trump ordered Israel to “immediately” stop bombing Gaza as he welcomed Hamas's partial acceptance of his ultimatum to end the nearly two-year war. In a statement on Friday evening, the Palestinian militant group asked for further negotiations on other parts of the plan, and did not say whether it would lay down its arms – a key part of Trump's proposal unveiled on Monday. Despite the qualified response by Hamas, Trump said in a post on Truth Social: “Based on the Statement just issued by Hamas, I believe they are ready for a lasting PEACE. Right now, it's far too dangerous to do that. “We are already in discussions on details to be worked out. In a brief video message posted separately Trump said it was a “very special day” and added that “Everybody will be treated fairly.” There were also strikes on Khan Younis but no reports of casualties, residents said. An AFP journalist in the Gaza Strip's coastal area of Al-Mawasi said they heard celebratory cries of “Allahu Akbar!” (God is the greatest) rise from tents housing Palestinians as news of Hamas's response filtered through. A feeling came over me, like, ‘Oh Allah, at last relief has come to us',” Samah Al-Hu, a displaced Palestinian in Al-Mawasi, said. In a statement earlier on Friday night, Hamas said it was giving its “approval of releasing all occupation prisoners – both living and remains – according to the exchange formula contained in president Trump's proposal, with the necessary field conditions for implementing the exchange”. Hamas also said it was prepared to turn over “the administration of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian body of independent technocrats based on Palestinian national consensus and supported by Arab and Islamic backing”. However, the group said “other issues” in Trump's proposal would need to be discussed further “within a unified Palestinian national framework”. The unspecified issues would likely include arms, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and international guarantees for a permanent ceasefire. Trump's plan called for an immediate end to fighting in Gaza, an exchange of hostages and Palestinian prisoners within 72 hours of the deal's signing, a gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, the disarmament of Hamas and a transitional authority led by Trump. Here is a link to the video instead. The deal was largely seen as unfavourable to Hamas and, if agreed in full, would likely spell the group's end as an armed Palestinian faction while demanding few concessions from Israel. Though Hamas did not immediately agree to disarm, its acceptance of a hostage handover will be seen as significant. Giving them up would we leave the group with few bargaining chips going forward. Israel's war in Gaza has killed at least 66,288 Palestinians and wounded about 170,000, according to the Gaza health authority, mainly civilians. A UN commission of inquiry and many human rights experts have concluded that Israel has committed genocide in Gaza. Netanyahu's government claims it has acted in self-defence. The war was launched by Israel in response to Hamas-led militants killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages in Israel on 7 October 2023. The Qatari ministry of foreign affairs also welcomed Hamas's response, and said it had begun working with fellow mediator Egypt to coordinate with the US on negotiations towards ending the war in Gaza. A spokesman for the UN secretary general, António Guterres, said he “urges all parties to seize the opportunity to bring the tragic conflict in Gaza to an end”, while the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, called for the Trump plan to be implemented “without delay”, saying Hamas's acceptance of it was “a significant step forwards”.</p>

If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation. Democrats are demanding that the bill restore funding for programs ensuring that low-income Americans and those who receive tax credits for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) can continue having access to health care. Trump has made several other posts attacking Democrats during the shutdown. One such post featured a racist video, made with AI technology, of House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) wearing a sombrero and donning a fake mustache — a reference to the false, race-baiting Republican talking point that Democrats are keeping the government shut down to force legislation that would allow undocumented immigrants to access federal health funds and programs. Trump's posts come just weeks after he and several other GOP voices demanded that Democrats tone down their supposedly hateful rhetoric in the wake of Charlie Kirk's murder. Trump — who has frequently peddled violent rhetoric and incited violence against against his political opponents — has used the killing to escalate his crackdown on dissent and people with left-leaning viewpoints, with him and his allies baselessly alleging that the “radical left” is “directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today.” Indeed, Trump signed an executive order last month designating “antifa” as a domestic terrorist organization, despite lacking the legal framework to do so. “Based on government and independent analyses, right-wing extremist violence has been responsible for the overwhelming majority of fatalities, amounting to approximately 75 percent to 80 percent of U.S. domestic terrorism deaths since 2001,” the study's authors wrote.

In June, officers arrested him while he was reporting at a “No Kings” protest against Trump, even though he was wearing a vest with “PRESS” written on the front and back. Guevara was taken to the local jail and then placed in ICE custody. All charges were dropped, but the government fought to deport him, arguing that he was a danger to the community based on his livestreams and videos of law enforcement activities. “I was showing their faces when they were arresting immigrants.” Guevara came to the U.S. on a B1 visa, is authorized to work in the United States, and has a social security number. Signatories included Art Spiegelman, Arundhati Roy, David Remnick, Ibram X. Kendi, Jelani Cobb, John Cusack, Judith Butler, Judy Blume, and Julianne Moore. Amnesty International USA's Executive Director Paul O'Brien said in a statement that deporting Guevara “sends a chilling and dangerous message: that journalists can be detained, silenced, and deported simply for doing their jobs.” “The already cruel immigration system is being used as a testing ground for widespread authoritarian practices under Trump, and now, with the deportation of Mario Guevara, it is being weaponized to silence a journalist,” he continued.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's note: This story was update to include a comment made by French President Emmanuel Macron. French reporter and photographer Antoni Lallican was killed and Ukrainian photographer Heorhii Ivanchenko was injured in a Russian drone strike, Ukraine's 4th Separate Mechanized Brigade said on Oct. 3. According to Reporters Without Borders (RSF), Russian forces have killed at least 13 journalists and injured nearly 50 since the start of the full-scale invasion as of February 2025. RSF, together with the Institute of Mass Information, has documented nearly 150 cases of journalists targeted by Russian abuses while carrying out their work. The Ukrainian Association of Professional Photographers said Ivanchenko had underwent surgery after being "seriously wounded." "We bow our heads in memory of Antoni and hope for the fastest possible recovery of Heorhii," the group said in a statement. Ivanchenko had previously worked with the Kyiv Independent as a freelance photographer. Lallican, a Paris-based photojournalist, covered social and humanitarian issues in conflict zones around the world. "I extend my heartfelt condolences to his family, his loved ones, as well as to all his colleagues who, at the peril of their lives, inform us and bear witness to the reality of the war," Macron wrote on X.

Authorities at Munich International Airport ordered a suspension in flight operations shortly after 9:30 p.m. local time after multiple drones were spotted in the vicinity of the airport for the second time in less than 24 hours. A Russian drone strike on a pig farm in Kharkiv Oblast killed approximately 13,000 pigs on Oct. 3, Ukraine's State Emergency Service (SES) reported. Ukraine's Special Operations Forces said that its drones struck a P-14F "Lena" long-range detection radar system as well as a "Sopka-2" en route radar complex in Russia's Voronezh Oblast. Both men were wearing protective gear marked "Press," Ukraine's 4th Separate Mechanized Brigade said, condemning the strike as a violation of international humanitarian law. "Just today, Russia struck our gas infrastructure with 35 missiles, including ballistic weapons. It was a combined strike, and only half of the missiles were shot down," Zelensky said after a meeting with Ukraine's top military command. We have our own fate, which is much easier than that of the Ukrainians," Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said in an interview. According to investigators, the suspect monitored Andriy Parubiy's daily routine and movements while preparing an escape plan abroad. Law enforcement officers detained him before he could leave Ukraine. The three men — Captain Davit Vadatchkor and assistant captains Robert Egizaryan and Santosh Kumar Chaurasia — had been accused of damaging undersea cables in the Baltic Sea.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US military carried out another strike on a boat operating in the Caribbean officials deemed to be a “narco-trafficking vessel” on Friday morning, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced in a social media post. The strike killed all four people who were on board, Hegseth said. Hegseth posted on X on Friday that at President Trump's order, he directed the “lethal, kinetic strike on a narco-trafficking vessel affiliated with Designated Terrorist Organizations in the USSOUTHCOM area of responsibility.” Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro said on Tuesday that he is preparing to declare a state of emergency to protect his country in the event of an attack by the US military. Hegseth did not say which terrorist organization the boat was allegedly affiliated with, but added that “our intelligence, without a doubt, confirmed that this vessel was trafficking narcotics, the people onboard were narco-terrorists, and they were operating on a known narco-trafficking transit route.” He alleged the boat was “transporting substantial amounts of narcotics - headed to America to poison our people.” The administration has previously argued that other boats it has struck were also headed to the US, necessitating urgent military action. However, at least one boat struck by the US military last month had turned around before it was hit, CNN has reported, indicating it did not pose an imminent threat to the US or US forces. Following the US' first such strike on September 2, Secretary of State Marco Rubio initially said that the boat had likely been headed toward Trinidad or elsewhere in the Caribbean. “They're throwing a lot of words out there that don't necessarily go together or constitute a coherent legal justification,” Brian Finucane, a former State Department lawyer who specializes in war powers issues, previously told CNN. In a letter to Congress this week, the Pentagon said Trump had determined that the US is in an “armed conflict” with the drug cartels his administration has designated as terrorist organizations, and that smugglers for the cartels are “unlawful combatants,” CNN has reported. Describing the US military strikes as part of an armed conflict suggests that the attacks are part of a longer-term campaign and not just one-off strikes in self-defense.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Balin Miller is third person to be killed in Californian national park this summer A climbing influencer fell to his death while livestreaming himself scaling an enormous sheer rock face in California. Balin Miller, 23, became the third person to be killed in Yosemite National Park this summer. Fans had watched him climb on a TikTok livestream for two days before his death. Yosemite National Park's El Capitan is one of the most striking features of the park, an enormous sheer granite rock face of approximately 3,000ft (915 metres) that entices big-wall rock climbers from all over the world. His heart and soul was truly to just climb. Miller died on the first day of the US government shutdown, under which national parks remained “generally” open but with limited operations and closed visitors centres. While it is still unclear exactly what happened, his older brother, Dylan Miller, said Balin was lead rope soloing (a way to climb alone while still protected by a rope) on a 2,400ft (730-metre) route named Sea of Dreams. He had already finished the climb and was hauling up his last bit of gear when he likely rappelled off the end of his rope, Mr Miller said. Miller was an accomplished alpinist who gained international attention for accomplishing the first solo ascent of Mount McKinley's Slovak Direct, a technically difficult route that took 56 hours to complete, he posted on his Instagram in June. He grew up climbing in Alaska with his brother and their father, who was also a climber. “I'm his bigger brother but he was my mentor.” Miller spent weeks solo climbing in Patagonia and the Canadian Rockies this year, ticking off a notoriously difficult ice climb called Reality Bath, which had been unrepeated for 37 years, according to Climbing magazine. “He has inspired so many people to do things that are perhaps unthinkable, including myself. I can't imagine climbing ever again without him,” his brother said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NATO's new Multi-Corps Land Component Command (MCLCC) officially opened its headquarters on October 3 in the Finnish city of Mikkeli, about 300 km from St. Petersburg, Russia. "We set out to seek the establishment of a NATO command in Finland in autumn 2023 to maximize Finland's security. Our objectives were approved at the meeting of NATO Ministers of Defense in June 2024. Now, a year later, we are already launching the command," Defense Minister Antti Hakkanen said at the ceremony, as quoted by the ministry's press service. Hakkanen stated that the headquarters' work would "strengthen NATO's defense capabilities" and "increase security in Finland." At present, it employs about ten people, with a peacetime staff expected to reach 50. According to the Finnish Defense Ministry, the headquarters will plan and coordinate NATO ground forces' activities in Northern Europe. "In normal conditions," it will be responsible for NATO drills and other activities, while "in emergency conditions," it will "plan, command and control land operations and defense in the High North." The MCLCC in Mikkeli began operations on September 1. In September 2024, it was reported that in peacetime the facility would plan and carry out NATO training activities in the region.</p>

MOSCOW, October 3. /TASS/. Ukraine's foreign ministry claims that the US federal government shutdown has not disrupted weapons supplies, nor has it had any impact on the drone deal.

"False. Ukraine-US drone deal talks are proceeding as planned and shipments continue to arrive," Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman Georgy Tikhiy wrote on his X page.

The US government suspended its operations on October 1 after Congress failed to pass a budget for the new fiscal year amid disputes between Republican and Democrat representatives on a number of expenditure items, including public health spending. They accuse each other of provoking and prolonging the shutdown for political purposes.

A Ukrainian negotiating team arrived in Washington on October 1 for talks on the so-called drone deal providing for the joint production of drones worth up to $50 billion. Some Western media reported following the shutdown that the talks had been cancelled. Apart from that, according to the US media, supplies of US weapons to Ukraine could be delayed amid the shutdown.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A general view of the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine on March 29, 2023. Ukraine's state nuclear operator Energoatom warned that the diesel generators powering the plant are designed only for short-term emergency use and are not meant to sustain the plant's operational needs for an extended period. A shutdown of these generators could result in a loss of control over the facility's nuclear safety systems. Diesel generators are now supplying power to the plant, but one has already failed, he said. Najmedin Meshkati, a professor of civil/environmental engineering, industrial and systems engineering and international relations at the University of Southern California, also confirmed that diesel generators "are not designed to be run in such a sustained period of time." "It's a risky situation because emergency generators are big machines, and they could easily break down. They are reliable, but at the same time, (require) a high-maintenance type of machinery due to their wear and tear," Meshkati said. Ukraine's Energy Ministry told the Kyiv Independent that the situation is further complicated by Russia's failure to carry out scheduled repairs and maintenance, which increases the risk of diesel generator failure and threatens a shutdown of the nuclear fuel cooling system and failure of critical safety systems. This could lead to a nuclear or radiation accident. "The potential consequences of the failure of safety systems at the ZNPP will be transboundary and pose a danger not only to Ukraine but also to many European countries," a spokesperson said. The ZNPP has been under Russian occupation since March 2022. The six reactors were shut down a month after Moscow's occupation, but the facility still requires electricity to maintain cooling and prevent a nuclear incident. Russian troops reportedly struck a power line on Sept. 23, severing the plant's connection to Ukraine's electrical grid. While Russian state media blame Ukraine for the strike, Greenpeace Ukraine published an investigation on Oct. 1, saying that there is no evidence of any military strikes around the pylons and power line network at the ZNPP. Greenpeace nuclear expert Jan Vande Putte told the Kyiv Independent that Russia can repair the line "in a matter of hours." It's a very precise sabotage," Vande Putte said. President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed a similar sentiment, writing in an Oct. 1 social post that "Russia is deliberately creating the threat of radiation incidents, taking advantage, unfortunately, of the weak position of the IAEA and its director, Rafael Grossi, as well as the distraction of global attention." Zelensky's statements came after a Russian attack on an energy facility in the town of Slavutych in Kyiv Oblast, which caused a several-hour blackout at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant on Oct. 1. While ZNPP "is not going to blow up tomorrow," the situation is serious in a long-term perspective, Vande Putte said. "They (Russians) can let the crisis get worse. (...) They can move closer and closer to that point over the coming week, and to have that kind of nuclear blackmail. "But they pressured the staff to the point that there was almost no one left to work there," he said. And the station has been turned into a military base." An investigation by the Truth Hounds and Greenpeace Ukraine published on Sept. 24 detailed Rosatom's role in pressuring plant staff,  including torture, "including beatings, electrocution, sexual violence, mock executions, and threats to family members of detainees." Meshkati suggests that Russia's actions at the power plant could be a negotiating tactic. "Nuclear plants are too important to be used as a bargaining chip or for political horse-trading or power plays. If something goes wrong, everybody, the friend and foe, will be hurt equally," Meshkati said. Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on Oct. 2 that Russia deliberately cut power to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant as it's preparing to reconnect the facility to its own energy system. Vande Putte also suggests that Russia's motivation is based "not so much for electricity reasons, but for military and political reasons." It's the way for them to say clearly "this is Russian territory, it's our nuclear power plant," Vande Putte said. In a Sept. 30 statement, the bloc's diplomatic service denounced Russian occupation of the plant as illegal and urged Moscow to withdraw its forces. The Zaporizhzhia plant has faced repeated safety concerns since Russia's invasion, including power outages, nearby shelling and staffing shortages. A monitoring mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been stationed at the ZNPP since September 2022, but Russian authorities have frequently restricted its access.

Miller had been hoping to lead a route at some point in Yosemite, Moorman said, having recently completed an ice and alpine climbing trip in his home state of Alaska.

In June, Miller completed what is believed to be the first solo climb of the Slovak Direct route on Mount McKinley in Alaska, North America's highest peak also known as Denali. Miller's death came on the first day of the federal government shutdown, with many national parks at risk of closing or having limited services available to visitors.</p>

Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield filed suit against the Trump administration on Sept. 28 after the president said he would send troops to defend immigration facilities in Portland from “domestic terrorists.” The state is asking the federal district court to find the deployment unlawful and block it, saying Trump was exaggerating the threat of protests to justify taking control over state National Guard troops.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. How Moscow Has Retained Influence in the Post-Assad Era When armed factions led by the group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham overthrew Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad last December, many observers believed that Russia's days in Syria were numbered. For decades, Moscow had nurtured close ties with the Assad family; less than a year ago, it bombed areas controlled by HTS. Since then, however, Russia has defied expectations, holding on to its main bases on Syria's coast—the Tartus naval facility and the Hmeimim airbase—and even entrenching itself in the country's northeast. Russian diplomats moved quickly to engage the new rulers in Damascus, benefiting from Syrians' perception that Russia is a great power and Shara's desire to build positive relations with all external governments. Syria's new leaders have, in turn, taken a constructive tone with Moscow, hoping for Russian energy, grain, friendly votes at the UN, and possibly, arms. By engaging Russia, Shara's government also seeks to deter former Assad loyalists from rearing their heads, to warn Western states that Syria can look elsewhere for support on energy and defense, and perhaps even to limit Israeli military action within its borders. Other interested parties want Russia to retain a modest presence in Syria, too: as different forces vie for clout, Russia has emerged as everyone's favorite hedge. Both Israel and Turkey calculate that Russia's influence could be leveraged to prevent the other from becoming too strong. And the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a Kurdish-led militia, want Russia on their side in case the United States abandons them or Damascus tries to quash their hopes for autonomy. The possibility that Russia could retain its foothold in Syria has caused some unease among European officials. U.S. and European leaders should accept that Russia will have a modest presence in Syria and avoid forcing Syria's new government to pick between their help or Russia's. When Bashar parachuted into power in 2000, he felt no special affinity for Russia. He traveled to London and Paris before visiting Moscow. But he still maintained Syria's friendly relations with the Kremlin. In 2017, Russia deployed its military police to certain so-called de-escalation zones as part of an initiative also backed by Iran and Turkey. By maintaining a military presence in the country and, later, negotiating evacuation deals for rebels, Russia amassed valuable experience dealing with different armed groups. Other countries intervening in Syria always had to consider Russia. In response, Russia stepped up its patrols near the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Moscow also intensified its bombardments of Idlib Province, a region controlled by anti-Assad rebels, to dissuade them from advancing. The rebels commenced their lightning offensive in late November 2024, and Russian forces largely stood aside, abandoning Assad to his fall. But Russia wasted no time in courting Syria's new rulers. Overnight, Russian TV stopped calling HTS a terrorist group. At the UN in early January 2025, Russian diplomats commended Syria's transitional government for acting “competently.” Later that month, a Russian delegation traveled to Damascus for wide-ranging negotiations, including on the future status of Russia's bases, investments into gas fields and ports, and—according to Syria's state-owned news agency, SANA—a request that Russia pay reparations for supporting Assad and contribute to Syria's reconstruction. (Russian President Vladimir Putin is unlikely ever to do so—even now that Syrian authorities have issued a formal arrest warrant—because he wants to maintain a reputation for sticking by his authoritarian partners.) Over the years, Tartus and Hmeimim had become critical logistics hubs for Russian operations in Africa. In the immediate aftermath of Assad's fall, Russia moved naval assets out of Tartus and consolidated its military aircraft, stationed at bases elsewhere in the country, at Hmeimim. In February, Syria's new defense minister hinted that Russia would be allowed to keep its bases as long as their existence served Syria's interests. “In politics, there are no permanent enemies,” he said. Negotiating over its bases, Russia has reminded Syria of the support it can offer. In the spring, Russia shipped oil, diesel, and wheat to Syria. According to Reuters, the Russian company Goznak, which is under British, European Union, and U.S. sanctions and has long printed Syria's currency, will issue the country's new banknotes. With its veto on the UN Security Council, Russia could help remove the UN's terrorist designations, which come with travel bans and asset freezes, on Shara and others close to him. Trained on Soviet and Russian systems, Syria's new army may also hope for Russian weapons in the future, especially because much of its military capability has been decimated by Israeli strikes over the past year. Many Syrians loathe Moscow for the countless bombs it dropped on Syrian cities in support of Assad. But Syrians never perceived Russia—as they did Iran—as sectarian or bent on changing the very fabric of their society. These perceptions—plus the fact that Maher al-Shara, Ahmed's brother, has family ties to Russia—also help explain why Russia was not chased out of Syria outright. In March, Sunni militants killed over 1,000 people, many of them Alawite, on Syria's coast. Israel has captured a buffer zone adjacent to the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights and regularly hit sites deep inside Syria, even as the two countries have begun to negotiate a security agreement. In that context, Damascus's bilateral engagement with Moscow serves several additional purposes. And Syria's new rulers may hope that Putin will use his good relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to get Israel to rein in its military activities on Syrian territory. As Syria's new rulers strive for “zero problems” with foreign powers they seem to believe that it is useful to keep things amicable with the Kremlin. Israel has its own reasons for wanting Russia to maintain a modest presence in Syria. Turkey wants a highly centralized Syria to quash the Syrian Kurds' aspiration for autonomy. Israel's leaders seem to think that Russia's presence might help keep the country divided into zones of influence. Ankara has registered Israel's daring attacks and Saudi Arabia's forays into Syria with apprehension. Turkey hopes that it could turn to Russia to keep Israel at bay, support removing the UN Security Council's terrorist designation on Shara, supply the weak Syrian military with weapons, and back Ankara's position against Syrian Kurds. When Assad was in power, Russia acquiesced to Turkish military operations against the SDF and jointly patrolled parts of northern Syria with Turkey. The group is at risk of losing autonomy as Shara tries to consolidate power. In recent months, the SDF has increased its engagement with Russia with the aim of gaining an advantage over Turkey and the government in Damascus—and to have an additional ally in case the United States makes good on its promise to substantially reduce or even end its military presence in Syria's northeast. Through the spring and summer, Moscow deployed air defense systems and electronic warfare units—which would allow Russia to jam radio signals—to its base at Qamishli airport (located in a Kurdish-majority area), expanded housing for its troops, and fortified the base's perimeter. Notwithstanding its cooperation with Turkey, Russia has in the past called for the protection of Kurdish rights and offered to mediate between Kurdish leaders and Syria's central government. Israel, Turkey, and the SDF each seek to leverage Russia's presence to accomplish goals that are fundamentally incompatible; given Russia's shrewd maneuvering in the past, each one has some reason to hope that Moscow will end up supporting their parochial ambition. In this fluid landscape, Russia will be one among many players, and far from the most important. Yet more than anything, Syria now needs economic support, financial investment, and the lifting of all remaining international sanctions. Even before it invaded Ukraine, Russia had little bandwidth to focus on Syria's economic recovery and reconstruction; with its resources now sunk deep into Ukraine, it has even less to spare. Africa Corps, a Russian paramilitary outfit, is currently consolidating its presence in West Africa, a region the Kremlin views as important. Still, Western states should not penalize Syria's new leaders for engaging Russia in the context of their pragmatic, multi-vector foreign policy. Soon after Assad fell, for example, the Dutch foreign minister, Caspar Veldkamp, suggested that the EU should consider lifting sanctions only if Syria expels Russia. But Shara has no intention of returning the country into Russia's orbit. In fact, he is maintaining a delicate balance between Russia and its adversaries. And it is unlikely that Russia's bases will serve as a conduit for Iran to claw its way back into Syria. As Syria's authorities navigate formidable challenges, it only seems prudent for them not to antagonize Russia. Rather than panicking over Moscow's maneuverings or conditioning their own support on Syria's total break with Russia, U.S. and European leaders should focus on helping Syrians recover after a decade of civil war and a half century of despotism.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. Both bodies use rigorous criteria to designate five progressive levels of food insecurity, with “famine” as the worst. In concluding that Gaza had reached level 5, the IPC further noted that since the crisis is “entirely man-made, it can be halted and reversed.” For months, the starvation of Gaza has seized international attention. In fact, it is not even the worst. In July 2024, the IPC concluded that “famine with reasonable evidence” was unfolding in war-torn Sudan, where large parts of the population have been cut off from food aid. According to recent IPC estimates, some 800,000 Sudanese are now suffering full-blown famine and another eight million face what the IPC calls a level 4 food “emergency,” just one step below that threshold. And just below that, some 22 million people—an astounding half of the country's total population—are contending with a level 3 food “crisis,” meaning they need aid in order to avoid becoming trapped in a doom loop of hunger and destitution. But for both populations, that may be too late. International humanitarian law dictates that essential aid should not be contingent on a cease-fire. Famines under any circumstance have been comparatively rare since the late twentieth century. In recent decades, bigger and more skilled relief agencies and better early-warning systems have made it much easier to address hunger crises before they reach catastrophe. In 2018, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2417—which formally highlighted the link between armed conflict and hunger and condemned depriving civilians of food as a method of warfare. At the time, China, Russia, and the United States each preferred to denounce some regimes while being more lenient toward others. But they all voted for the principle that intentionally starving civilians was a war crime. Just seven years later, that looks like a long-lost era, and not only because of the disastrous wars in Gaza and Sudan. In conflicts around the world, including in Ethiopia, Myanmar, and Ukraine, military forces and their backers have once again been weaponizing hunger. Yet leading global powers, distracted by volatile geopolitical shifts, new rivalries, and economic challenges at home, have done little to stop them. Meanwhile, the humanitarian-aid budgets of many wealthy countries have been drastically cut. Withholding access to food is among the oldest weapons of war. In 1988, near the frontline of a previous civil war between the government and southern rebels, I witnessed unchecked starvation, with civilians dying at a rate almost 50 times the IPC famine threshold. The horrors of that war were a catalyst for change. Over the following decades, data on hunger crises also improved. Humanitarians now had a blueprint for how to monitor and prevent starvation; they just needed high-level political backing to sweep away the roadblocks, open aid corridors, and demand cease-fires. With the UN Security Council's passage of Resolution 2417, it looked like that resolve had finally crystallized. She refrained from publicly condemning Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for their blockade of Yemen, but U.S. officials worked quietly—and effectively—to ensure that aid was delivered. After Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine and blockade of Ukraine's grain exports, international attention shifted to securing global food supplies. Sudan is today's biggest and most intractable famine. Amid the vicious two-and-a-half-year civil war between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a ruthless paramilitary organization led by General Mohamed Hamdan Dagolo, known as Hemedti, the numbers of hungry, destitute, and displaced are mounting every day. Because the warring parties restrict aid operations and many parts of the country are difficult to access, data is poor. This tragedy is a direct result of actions taken by the warring parties on a population that is especially vulnerable to food weaponization. Before the current war began, more than two million people in Darfur were already living in camps and relied on World Food Program rations—more than half of which was funded by USAID. In this precarious situation, RSF forces have systematically pillaged towns and villages and laid siege to El Fasher, the last SAF stronghold in Darfur, for more than 500 days. Although the SPLA-N and RSF recently signed a political pact, people in encircled towns and ravaged villages continue to starve. Yet this catastrophic situation has failed to trigger international action. This year, the UN scaled back its emergency appeal for Sudan, aiming to reach just two-thirds of the 30.9 million people in need. Even so, as of September, that bare-bones goal is barely 25 percent funded. Until January this year, USAID supported 1,400 community kitchens across Sudan, which were run by a network of local volunteers and were considered highly effective. Even the UN Security Council has been unable to muster a strong response. But in November, Moscow vetoed a second, more forceful resolution, saying it infringed on Sudanese sovereignty—a sign of how impunity has become the norm. In mid-September, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, together with his counterparts in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates—collectively the Quad—announced a cease-fire plan that requires the two sides to immediately allow in humanitarian aid. To actually stop the crisis, an international aid campaign must not only purchase and ship food and medicine to Sudan but also ensure that they are delivered to where they are most needed, a process that involves relief convoys traversing vast distances on poor roads with numerous roadblocks where local commanders run extortion rackets. For those already sucked into the vortex of famine, this slow timeline could be a death sentence. If Sudan is the world's worst manmade hunger crisis, Gaza has become its most visible. For months, images of starving children and crowds of desperate people risking life and limb in a struggle for food have shocked the international public. Even before Israel's ground invasion of Gaza City began, conditions were dire for the nearly one million people remaining there. But using its second-best measure, surveying children's mid-upper-arm circumference, it found a sixfold increase in malnutrition between early June and later July—the kind of exponential spike that occurs when a population is spiraling into famine. By August, reported deaths from starvation were also mounting, and the IPC inferred, in line with its data from previous crises, that these numbers are a small fraction of the overall hunger toll, with many more perishing from the ravages of disease on malnourished bodies and low rates of survival after surgery because wounds need nutrition to heal. In early March, Israel began a total blockade of Gaza and did not allow food into the territory for 11 weeks. And when Israel, under enormous pressure, finally allowed some aid to resume, it insisted that aid would henceforth be distributed not by the UN and long-established humanitarian nongovernmental organizations, but by a new entity, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, under the supervision of the Israel Defense Forces. As has been widely reported, aid distribution from these sites has been plagued by violence, with more than 1,000 people shot and killed by IDF soldiers and private security contractors. Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu has tried to dismiss the pictures of starving children as “fake” and claimed falsely that the IPC has lowered its thresholds for famine. (Notably, Israel was quiet about what transpired last May, when FEWS NET reported that northern Gaza was in famine, and the IPC adjudged that the evidence didn't yet warrant the finding.) If Israel wanted to clear its name, it could permit better humanitarian data gathering—and indeed, allow international journalists to enter Gaza. Aid practitioners know what's needed to reverse the Gaza famine, and because the area is small and accessible, they could make it happen very quickly. But in order to do so, external powers, and particularly the United States, must force Israel to allow the UN and humanitarian agencies to do their job, unhindered and at scale. In January 2025, the incoming Trump administration insisted on a cease-fire, and Israel concurred. For aid workers, the urgency of needs has created a larger dilemma. Established humanitarians condemned this, arguing that the GHF doesn't adhere to core humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality, and independence. To a degree, these shortcomings should not be disqualifying: after all, an occupying power—such as Israel in Gaza—has legal obligations to provide aid, but it clearly isn't neutral or independent. But ending mass starvation requires more than handing out boxes of food. In such a crisis, people are so gripped by hunger that they may transgress social norms—scavenging in garbage heaps, eating animal fodder, and stealing food or hiding it from their neighbors. Thus far, the GHF has failed the test of humanity because it fails to treat Palestinians as dignified human beings. The foundation's basic rations might keep people alive but destroy their dignity in doing so. Observing the lack of accountability in Tigray, Mariupol, El Fasher, and now Gaza City, autocrats and warlords in any of a dozen of the world's hot spots may well seize the chance to employ this terrible weapon. Danger spots include a looming new war between Ethiopia and Eritrea, escalating conflicts in the West African Sahel, Myanmar's ongoing campaign to destroy the country's Rohingya minority, and Venezuela's relentless food crisis. Paradoxically, this trend is occurring even as international bodies have finally begun to condemn weaponized starvation. Eighteen months ago, in the case brought by South Africa against Israel, the International Court of Justice ruled that Israel should immediately provide a full spectrum of humanitarian relief and essential services, at scale and unhindered. Israel hasn't complied, a failing that increases the risk that the ICJ will in due course find that the Israeli government hasn't met its duty to prevent genocide. In November 2024, the International Criminal Court for the first time cited starvation crimes in announcing international arrest warrants against Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, giving a high profile to the issue. On Sudan, UN Security Council Resolution 2736, of June 2024, still stands, demanding humanitarian aid and protection of civilians in the famine zone—but has never been enforced. Failing to enforce these decisions risks making a mockery of them. In a world with apparently insoluble problems, preventing famine is one of the easier ones. Sufficient humanitarian funding is one step—$85 billion would meet the UN's overall target for this year. That's tiny compared with current spending on arms or the development of artificial intelligence. And those funds won't be needed next year if agreed measures against starvation crimes are enforced. States can legitimately fight in self-defense, but the rules of war must be obeyed. Political solutions in Sudan and between Israel and Palestine may be hard to find, but keeping people from starving is perfectly feasible. It should be something on which all can agree.

ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) — French soccer great Zinedine Zidane's son Luca was called up by Algeria for the first time Thursday, with the team close to qualifying for the 2026 World Cup in North America. Luca Zidane, a 27-year-old goalkeeper, represented France at youth level but never for the senior national team and is eligible for Algeria through his father's family ties. FIFA approved a change of national eligibility two weeks ago for Zidane, who once played at Real Madrid when his father was coach there. He is now with Spanish second-division team Granada. Algeria coach Vladimir Petkovic picked Zidane in a 26-player squad for qualifying games against Somalia on Oct. 9 and Uganda five days later. Zinedine Zidane played at three World Cups for France, winning the 1998 title at home and losing the final in 2006. His red card in extra time of the 2006 final for headbutting Italy defender Marco Materazzi is part of World Cup lore and was his final game as a player.
