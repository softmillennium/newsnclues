McLaren ‘in a good place' after Friday practice – Piastri

‘We're not as fast as we look,' insists Hadjar after taking P2 in second practice

Oscar Piastri set the pace during a disrupted second practice hour on Friday in Singapore, but can McLaren lead the way throughout the weekend or is one of their rivals looking likely to pose a challenge?

It wasn't the smoothest of days for Formula 1's 10 teams in Singapore as a disrupted second practice – which is the only practice session to take place at night and thus the only representative running drivers will get before Qualifying – meant very few long runs were completed, while multiple drivers had to abort their soft-tyre runs because of stoppages or yellow flags. That makes it's very tricky to work out a pecking order - but there are a few trends that emerged....

Championship leader Oscar Piastri wasted no time putting his frustrating weekend in Baku behind him (he suffered his first DNF of the year with crashes in both Qualifying and the race) to go top of the pile – and it looks like his McLaren is the one to beat as they search for 13 points this weekend to wrap up the Teams' Championship.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>McLaren ‘in a good place' after Friday practice – Piastri George Russell has apologised to Mercedes after crashing out of second practice for the Singapore Grand Prix, having lost some track time and left his mechanics with more work to do overnight. While most other drivers ended the night-time running with some 20 laps under their belts, Russell could take no further part and was limited to just six tours, putting him on the back foot for Saturday's action. “Thankfully I sort of went in front-end on and didn't do too much damage. Obviously game over, so it's a bit annoying. I'm sorry to the team for that, but better today than tomorrow.” In those early laps [of FP2] I had a much better feel with the car, to be honest. “We didn't complete any [proper] laps, so there was no sort of real lap time on the board, but at least the laps, if you took the sectors together, felt better. “As I said, it's not been our best Friday by a long way. “The result definitely didn't show what we could have achieved. “On the soft I had to abort the lap, but we were on for a pretty good lap. To be honest, I felt pretty good in the car. There's still quite a little bit to improve, but as well with my driving I'm trying to evolve lap by lap.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Typically high temperatures and humidity levels are expected at the Singapore Grand Prix, leading to a ‘heat hazard' being declared. A ‘heat hazard' has been declared by Formula 1's governing body, the FIA, for this weekend's Singapore Grand Prix. Ahead of the 2025 season getting under way, it was confirmed that a ‘heat hazard' can be declared if pre-weekend weather forecasts predict temperatures of 31 Celcius or above at some point during a Sprint or Grand Prix. Teams are notified of the declaration by the FIA, as they have been in Singapore, and subsequently need to fit a ‘Driver Cooling System'. Singapore has made a name for itself as one of the toughest races on the calendar, both physically and mentally, with the demands of driving an F1 car around city streets added to by high temperatures and humidity levels. All three days of action at the Marina Bay Street Circuit are set to feature air temperatures above 30 Celsius, as well as high humidity, even with Free Practice 2, Qualifying and the Grand Prix taking place well into the evening. In short, this is defined as a system with the “sole purpose” of providing additional cooling for drivers under a ‘Heat Hazard' scenario. Several components are involved, including a pump, plumbing and thermal store, with cold fluid generated by the system delivered to the drivers through a special fireproof vest featuring various tubes. Given this extra, mandated equipment, an increase to the standard 800kg minimum car weight limit will come into play, with two different numbers applied: an additional 2kg for practice, Qualifying and Sprint Qualifying sessions, and +5kg for a Sprint or Grand Prix. “We've used the driver cooling vest a few times already this season at hot races, but obviously this is the first time where [the Driver Cooling System] has become mandatory, which is good news,” said Russell. “When you're racing in 90% humidity and the cockpit [temperatures] are getting on for 60 degrees, it's a bit of a sauna inside the car, so I think we all welcome it.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>McLaren ‘in a good place' after Friday practice – Piastri Aston Martin driver Fernando Alonso was a somewhat surprising pace-setter during Friday's first practice session for the Singapore Grand Prix, leading the way from Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and the Red Bull of Max Verstappen. Alonso worked his way down to a best time of 1m 31.116s over the course of the one-hour session, which began at 1730 local time under cloudy skies – fresh from some afternoon showers – in typically hot and humid conditions. Those high temperatures led to a pre-weekend ‘heat hazard' declaration from F1's governing body, the FIA, introduced following the conditions experienced at the 2023 Qatar Grand Prix, meaning a special ‘Driver Cooling System' has been fitted to cars this weekend. While that unfolded, the remaining 19 drivers got laps on the board and tried to find a rhythm around the Marina Bay Street Circuit – Lando Norris going fastest (1m 33.388s) via a wobble through Turn 17 and Leclerc surviving a lock-up at Turn 13. Bad news followed for Albon, with Williams confirming that his car had experienced a rear brake hardware problem, ruling him out for the remainder of the session – although the team are “confident” of it being resolved ahead of second practice. Further moments followed when drivers began to push that little bit harder, bringing a trip to the run-off for Alpine's Pierre Gasly when he went too deep at Turn 14, and a close call with the wall for Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton exiting the same corner. Attention then turned to drivers' soft-shod running, with the first runs on Pirelli's red-marked compound triggering another flurry of green and purple sector times – Leclerc going quickest on a 1m 31.266s from Verstappen, Norris and Racing Bulls rookie Isack Hadjar. “That felt very understeery,” reported Piastri, meanwhile, after initially lapping more than half a second slower than team mate Norris – the Australian looking to bounce back from a difficult Azerbaijan weekend that saw his championship lead cut to 25 points. Despite some traffic and a brush with the wall, Piastri improved significantly to edge out Norris for fifth, followed by Hadjar, Sainz, the second Red Bull of Yuki Tsunoda and Haas racer Esteban Ocon, who rounded out the top-10 positions. Drivers and teams will now regroup in the Marina Bay paddock to dig through the data ahead of Free Practice 2, which is set to begin at 2100 local time and take place in conditions more representative of Qualifying and the Grand Prix.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>McLaren ‘in a good place' after Friday practice – Piastri Check out all of the odds for this weekend's Singapore Grand Prix, from the pole position favourite to who might claim victory. Odds are provided by F1's Official Betting Data Supplier ALT Sports Data, are subject to change and are presented in decimal form: for every $1 wagered you would win the figure represented by the odds; so, if Verstappen is favourite at 1.50, you would win $1.50 for every dollar bet. Despite his return to the winner's circle, Verstappen has had to battle in previous editions of the Singapore Grand Prix, never claiming top honours. Last year's winner Lando Norris enters the weekend with five triumphs to his name this year, but the Briton failed to capitalise on team mate Oscar Piastri's DNF in Baku, leaving valuable championship points on the table. Double Singapore podium finisher Charles Leclerc is tipped as having a decent chance of adding to this tally during the weekend ahead. The Spaniard will be hoping for another strong result as he lines up on the circuit where he triumphed from lights to flag in 2023. Isack Hadjar only has two top-sixes in the vault this campaign, but they've both come on tracks demanding a higher downforce set-up. He thrived in the Netherlands a month ago, clinching his first F1 rostrum, and backed it up with consecutive 10th places in Italy and Azerbaijan. Liam Lawson stands out as a value-for-money pick, coming off his second top-six return in seven starts. The Kiwi has really settled into his role at Racing Bulls, and qualified third fastest in Baku before finishing fifth. Over at the senior team, Yuki Tsunoda stepped up to drive his finest race in an RB21. He ended sixth in the previous round to give his team their highest points tally in a single Grand Prix this season. Meanwhile, three-time event victor Lewis Hamilton carries shorter odds for a top-six after collecting eight in 17 rounds. Double World Champion Fernando Alonso touches down in Southeast Asia with six top-10s to his name. Esteban Ocon is another competitor with six top-10 results behind him. Lance Stroll lines up on the streets of Marina Bay after finishing inside the first 10 positions on five occasions in 2025 while, over at Kick Sauber, Gabriel Bortoleto arrives into the weekend averaging 9.80 since F1's visit to Belgium. Verstappen leads the Pirelli Pole Position award with six fastest Qualifying laps in 17 rounds. The Briton did it on these streets a year ago and also took pole in Monaco earlier in the year, a track with similar downforce demands. Leclerc presents attractive odds to qualify quickest, having twice claimed pole position in previous editions of the Singapore Grand Prix. They only require 13 points to put the title beyond their peers, but the papaya outfit will clearly be seeking a repeat of Norris' 2024 race win regardless. However, they need to outscore the Woking team by 31 and 35 points respectively. The Silver Arrows will be hoping for a good result after a second and fourth-place return in Baku, while Ferrari have taken top honours in Marina Bay three times in the past 10 editions.</p>
