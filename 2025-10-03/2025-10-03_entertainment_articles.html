                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Up until now, ABC's Scrubs revival has been almost entirely nostalgia-facing in how it's been presented to the world: Series creator Bill Lawrence knows fans will be tuning in, to a pretty heavy degree, to check back in on the old Sacred Heart gang, and so all the early promotion for the show—including a cast photo released after the show's first table read last week—has focused on returning stars Zach Braff, Donald Faison, Sarah Chalke, Judy Reyes, and John C. McGinley. But Lawrence has also talked about the show having a healthy component focused on younger and newer characters, and now a big dump of casting info has arrived to confirm that there will be plenty of new folks around to struggle with modern medicine. This is per Variety, reporting on the new intern class that the show (which is being showrun by original series alums Tim Hobert and Aseem Batra) will feature in its revival season: Ava Bunn, Jacob Dudman, David Gridley, Layla Mohammadi, and Amanda Morrow, all of whom are relative newcomers, and will be billed as recurring guest stars.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rachel Reilly isn't done with reality TV just yet. If she were to be cast, she would become the first contestant ever to complete CBS's “Reality Trifecta” of “Big Brother,” “The Amazing Race,” and “Survivor.” A post shared by CBS Big Brother (@bigbrothercbs) Reilly reshared a video of “Survivor” host Jeff Probst to her Instagram Story. Reilly then tagged a “Survivor” casting director in her post and wrote, “Working on that [audition] tape this week!” She has a lengthy reality television career with CBS. She also works as a casting agent for various unscripted shows. While nothing is guaranteed, if Reilly were given a spot on an upcoming season of “Survivor,” she would become the first person to complete the CBS “Reality Trifecta.” Reilly has competed on three seasons of “Big Brother” and three seasons on “The Amazing Race.” What's left to do? During that interview, Probst was told that Reilly was interested in competing on his show and becoming the first person to complete the trifecta. “I mean, come on, she's got to want it bad enough to send in a little two-minute video and say, ‘Here's why I should be on. This recent push for Reilly to compete on “Survivor” came after she was shockingly eliminated on “Big Brother” in September due to the “White Locust” twist. Fans and former houseguests thought this new twist was unfair. It sent the “Big Brother” legend home without facing an eviction vote. Ultimately, she voted for her ally, Ashley Hollis, to win the game.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Friday evening (Oct. 3), Spotify announced that Taylor Swift has another new streaming record under her belt. Spotify announced about 11 hours after the album's release that it has already broken the record for most streamed album in a single day so far in 2025. It's no surprise one record has already fallen. As Good Morning America reported from Spotify's Life of a Showgirl pop-up experience in New York City Friday morning, there were 1.2 million users on the platform who were streaming the new album exactly at that moment. Shortly after the release of The Life of a Showgirl, Swift shared a message with her fans about her latest album. “I can't tell you how proud I am to share this with you, an album that just feels so right,” she wrote in part in an Instagram post. The pop superstar first announced the 12-track project on now-fiancé Travis Kelce and brother Jason Kelce's podcast, New Heights, in August. Swift has also said that the album, which is filled with what she described as “bangers,” was worked on in Sweden with producers Max Martin and Shellback during her career-spanning, record-breaking Eras Tour, which became the highest grossing tour of all time when it wrapped in December.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Powered by a creative team that was embracing the “too-online writer” stereotype back when that meant, like, Usenet, the long-running animated series started pegging too-picky fans early and often, doing foundational work in the “Chill out, Poindexter” sciences. We're happy to report that the show's modern creators have not dropped the ball in this regard, either, as series showrunner Matt Selman recently addressed one of the show's most obvious points of fan nit-picking—a sliding timescale that now means Homer and Marge Simpson are, in many cases, younger than fans who grew up watching the series when it first started airing—with a fresh and resounding cry of ” None of it happened! Selman was talking to Entertainment Weekly, and specifically about last week's season 37 premiere, “Thrifty Ways To Thieve Your Mother.” (Because what young and hip millennials don't love a 50-year-old Paul Simon pun?) Yeah, basically: “It's a fucking paradox,” Selman says in the EW interview, laying out the obvious practicalities that fans basically have to accept by now. It would've been interesting as an experiment to just lock into the '70s and have them be like, ‘Well, Lisa, when I was a kid in the '70s…' and then just have it all be about the '70s, even though we live in the fucking post-apocalyptic future now. Selman, who seems mostly amused by the whole phenomenon, invites fans to drive themselves crazy in whichever ways they like: “If it brings you pleasure as a fan to pick apart the timeline of a 40-year-old show where the characters do not age, please pick it away. Have fun, pick at it, go crazy, pick it away…I would also like to point out that in no way are we saying that the beloved other flashbacks didn't happen. Everything happened and didn't happen with the same level of historical veracity.” Paul Thomas Anderson's latest wages One Battle After Another with white supremacy By Matt Schimkowitz September 29, 2025 | 10:00am The end is nigh, and always has been By Mike Vago September 28, 2025 | 12:00pm 5 To Watch: TV shows that prove the hangout comedy is still hanging in there By A.V.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In advance of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, HGTV fan favorite Hilary Farr offered an emotional message via social media on September 29, 2025, urging her fans to get screened. The famed designer, who announced her departure from “Love It or List It” in December 2023 after starring in 258 episodes of the show, began her latest video on Instagram by saying, “Hi, I'm Hilary Farr and I am a breast cancer survivor.” In her video, Farr said she had partnered with the American Cancer Society (ACS) to help spread awareness as a breast cancer survivor. “You're going to see an awful lot of people in pink shirts and with pink pins showing their awareness and their support,” Farr told her followers. But I think it's time to do a little bit more, if we can.” “Now here's a statistic that I really think you should know,” Farr said. “And fight they will,” Farr continued, “and the research that is being done is going to help us every inch of the way. “I felt so much relief,” she recalled to People. But in late 2014, while filming “Love It or List It” in Raleigh, North Carolina, another mammogram revealed a new tumor that had spread into surrounding breast tissue, Farr told People. She was diagnosed with invasive breast cancer and underwent a second lumpectomy surgery. Farr told the outlet that her medical oncologist said they got all of the cancer, but erroneously said she didn't need any further treatment. However, two months later, Farr learned she needed radiation to destroy any remaining cancer cells and reduce the risk of recurrence. “I felt absolute fury that someone could be so flippantly wrong,” she said, noting that she filed a complaint and the oncologist retired the following year. Farr underwent 28 rounds of radiation in March 2015, but another lump was found seven months later. Farr has been in remission since her third lumpectomy, but revealed to one of the fans who commented on her September 29 post that she still deals with the side effects of treatment. The fan, who said she was a fellow breast cancer, wrote, “I developed lymphedema in my right arm nearly 2 years after a lumpectomy and node removal. Also side effects from radiation … But We're Still Here!” The body's lymph system helps to fight off infection and disease, but cancer or cancer treatment can disrupt the flow and cause extremities to swell dramatically. For breast cancer patients, per the NCI, lymphedema tends to develop in the hands, arms or chest due to lymph nodes being removed or damaged during treatment. Many of Farr's followers shared their breast cancer stories in the comment section of her post, and others praised her for speaking up about the importance of early detection, including one who wrote, “What a wonderful way to celebrate and recognize and help those going through what you've experienced first hand👏 and you look beautiful.” Since Farr left “Love It or List It,” a new version launched in 2025 featuring her former co-star, David Vistentin, paired with longtime HGTV personality Paige Turner. The new duo has begun filming their second season together in Toronto.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>1 exhibitor in the world's theatrical release of Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl, is heading toward a $15M-$16M Friday with a current opening-weekend forecast of $29M-$31M at 3,700 theaters. Note these figures do not come from AMC Theatres There are some estimates out there as high as $40M, but here is what's vital to keep in mind: This is very front-loaded with advance tickets sales arguably accounted for (true, we heard that last time with Dragon Ball: Infinity Castle, but that found an audience). The notion here is that all Swifties are making a date to see Showgirl today, because it's the release date of her album The Life of a Showgirl (duh). RELATED: Taylor Swift Reveals How Travis Kelce “Crushed” Proposal & Why ‘Life Of A Showgirl' Was A Remedy When She Was “Worn Down” During Eras Tour Although not any kind of October opening record, the marvel of it all is how the 14x Grammy winner was able to announce a cinematic experience two weeks before its release; steal Premium Large Format screens from Dwayne Johnson's The Smashing Machine, Leonardo DiCaprio's One Battle After Another and James Cameron's re-release of Avatar: The Way of Water; and get to this box office threshold with very little P&A. Swift already has broken the Spotify record for most single-day streams; her pre-saves for Showgirl were north of 5 million. No word yet where album sales will land for Swift on Showgirl, but she's the only performer to have sold more than 1M albums a week seven times. Swift's bestselling album reportedly is 1989, which has sold 14M copies in the U.S. alone and going platinum abroad. RELATED: George Michael Estate Praises Taylor Swift's ‘Father Figure' Update: “We Had No Hesitation” It was the best of times, and it was the worst of times at the weekend box office — the latter going to Dwayne Johnson's arthouse biopic about UFC fighter Mark Kerr, The Smashing Machine, which unfortunately is in a sleeper hold and destined for $6M-$7M in third place at 3,345 locations (read Deadline's review here). The net $50M production was funded largely by foreign sales. Smashing Machine hit tracking three weeks ago with a $20M projection. But after Swift announced two weeks ago that she was pushing her way onto The Rock's weekend, forecasts plummeted. In second, is Warner Bros.' second weekend of One Battle After Another (read our review here), still armed with its 70MM Imax locations, with an estimated $12.5M (-43%) after a second Friday of $3.6M. If all goes right, domestic hits $44.1M by Sunday and overseas shoots to $56M take after a second frame $17M haul for a $100.1M global running cume. Universal's second weekend of Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie at 3,507 venues is collapsing with $4.7M in 4th, -66%. Fifth belongs to New Line's The Conjuring: Last Rites at 2,753 with a fifth Friday of $1.1M and fifth frame of $3.8M, -44%, and running cume of $166.6M, again, the highest-grossing movie in the horror franchise. 20th Century Studios via Disney's reissue of Avatar: The Way of Water at 2,140 sites is seeing a $3M outside the Top 5.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are moments across Taylor Swift's newly released album, The Life of a Showgirl, that revel in the theatrics of public spectacles and high drama, something she knows well. Her 12-album discography has no shortage of friends, foes, lovers, and skeptics playing key characters in her music, but her new song “Actually Romantic” introduces a new leading lady who fans can't stop speculating about. But their stars blazed different paths for them both, converging again only by a twist of fate. Charli fell in love with the 1975's George Daniel in 2022, then a year later, Swift had entered a highly public and controversial situationship with the 1975's Matty Healy. For the first time in a while, their pop world's fully collided. Taylor Swift tapped Camila Cabello and Charli XCX to join her as openers for her Reputation stadium tour in 2018, welcoming both singers onstage for a rendition of “Shake It Off” every night. “But as an artist, it kind of felt like I was getting up on stage and waving to 5-year-olds. Charli later clarified that she felt the quote had been taken out of context, adding on Twitter at the time, “I'd been playing a [ton] of 18+ club shows and so to be on stage in front of all ages was new to me and made me approach my performances with a whole new kind of energy… I am extremely grateful for the opportunity I was given.” Taylor and Charli's paths crossed once again in 2023 — this time thanks to the 1975. At the time, Charli and her now-husband, George Daniel, the band's guitarist, had been together for at least a year after going Instagram official in 2022. Swift started dating the 1975 frontman Matty Healy after weeks of speculation in May 2023, although they only lasted a few months together. “I wanna dance with george foreverrrr,” she captioned some of her wedding pictures. Charli XCX's unexpected Brat was sold as an album with fewer complexities than she set out to communicate across its track list. But as much as she was bumpin' that on “365,” she was also putting her biggest insecurities under a microscope on “Girl, So Confusing” (about how she and Lorde orbited each other before they worked it out on the remix) and “Sympathy is a Knife,” which many people thought revolved around Swift. Taylor Swift Releases 'The Life of a Showgirl' Album & Swifties Are Celebrating With Fan-Inspired Merch Taylor Swift Won't Be Touring Anytime Soon: 'I Am So Tired' In the first verse, she sets the stage: “This one girl taps my insecurities/Don't know if it's real or if I'm spiraling.” Later, she gets a little more direct, singing, “Don't wanna see her backstage at my boyfriend's show/Fingers crossed behind my back, I hope they break up quick.”Listeners were quick to make the connection to Swift and Healy. While Charli hasn't directly addressed whether “Sympathy Is a Knife” references Swift, she did say in a since-deleted TikTok post that there are no “diss tracks” on Brat. She issued the clarification after lyrics to the album leaked, and also criticized the experience of being a “female artist, where you are pitted against your peers but also expected to be best friends with every single person constantly. “I think it's really just only human to at some points in your life compare yourself to other people,” she said while explaining “Sympathy Is a Knife” during a Brat track-by-track. You can't be too tough on yourself, because the world is really vicious and really hard, and envy is a natural emotion for people. Charli XCX called out her fans after a June show in São Paulo, where videos surfaced of crowds chanting “Taylor is dead.” On Instagram Stories, she urged them to stop: “Can the people who do this please stop, online or at my shows. It is the opposite of what I want, and it disturbs me that anyone would think there is room for this in this community.” In that same interview, Swift was quoted praising Charli. She just takes a song to places you wouldn't expect it to go, and she's been doing it consistently for over a decade,” Swift said. Online, speculation quickly mounted, with people guessing it referenced Charli's “Everything Is Romantic” in its title. “Some people might be offended/But it's actually sweet/All the time you've spent on me.” Taylor Swift Conquers Her Biggest Stage Ever on ‘The Life of a Showgirl' Hayley Williams Confirms Morgan Wallen Is the ‘Racist Country Singer' She Sings About Taylor Swift's ‘The Life of a Showgirl' Is Officially Here (How many artists sold vinyl records filled with white powder?) The line “How many times has your boyfriend said/‘Why are we always talkin' 'bout her? '” feels like a response to Charli singing, “George says I'm just paranoid/Says he just don't see it, he's so naive.” But other shots on the song feel rooted in private interactions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>(That sentence adds up to just over four years, but the 14 months he has already served in prison will be deducted.) Today in Manhattan's Federal District Court, U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian outlined his reasoning behind the substantial length, citing the need “to send a message to abusers and victims alike that exploitation and violence against women is met with real accountability.” “The Court has to consider all of your history here. A history of good works can't wash away the record in this case, which shows that you abused the power and control over the lives of women who you professed to love,” said Judge Subramanian. He apologized to Cassie Ventura and her family “for any harm or hurt that I've caused her, emotionally or physically.” He also apologized to former girlfriend Jane, saying, “I brought you into my mess.” Diddy then apologized to all victims of domestic violence, his family, and his children, and referred to his conduct “disgusting, shameful, and sick.” “No matter what anybody says, I know that I'm truly sorry for it all,” he concluded. Diddy's hearing opened with Judge Subramanian setting a sentencing guideline of 70 to 87 months—nearly six to just over seven years—which far exceeded the maximum of 14 months that Diddy's lawyers requested, and stated that the law allowed him to consider all relevant testimony and evidence from the trial in making his final decision. He added that Diddy “has expressed remorse for some things,” but not for his actual convictions of transporting people to engage in prostitution. Diddy, who pleaded not guilty to all the charges, still faces numerous civil lawsuits accusing him of various sex crimes. “This is not just a case about freak-offs and hotel rooms,” U.S. prosecutor Christy Slavik said today before the judge, arguing for a more severe sentence. “[It's] about a man who did horrible things to other people. He weaponized it.” Slavik continued: “The defendant tries to argue this is just a sex, drugs, and rock ‘n' roll lifestyle. But this is a case about transportation for prostitution and violence. Slavik also claimed that Diddy is still acting with extreme arrogance in the wake of his charges because the rapper booked multiple speaking engagements in Miami “for next week,” implying Diddy expected a light sentence, reports The New York Times. Giovanni Sairras—founder of Re-entry One, a nonprofit that helps incarcerated people re-enter society upon their release—elaborated on why his nonprofit booked Diddy as “an instructor teaching both virtually and in person” about entrepreneurship, mentorship, life skills, and more. Diddy's lawyers, Marc Agnifilo, Jason Driscoll, Teny Geragos, Alexandra Shapiro, and Brian Steel, were present for the decision, as were the disgraced rapper and his family. Diddy's lawyers argued for a more lenient sentence of no more than 14 months in prison, including his time already served, by pointing to the sentences of similar cases. Diddy's lawyers also submitted numerous letters written by those who can speak to the hip-hop mogul's character—including a letter by Diddy himself, which Judge Subramanian criticized as “inappropriate” in tone—as well as a 12-minute video to play in court, which compiled various footage of Diddy hosting charity events, interacting with his children at home, and taking part in other moments meant to emphasize his generosity. Casandra Elizabeth “Cassie” Ventura, Diddy's former girlfriend, set off a chain of litigation when she filed her bombshell lawsuit against Diddy in November 2023. “I am so scared that if he walks free, his first actions will be swift retribution towards me and others who spoke up about his abuse at trial,” she wrote. The federal indictment alleged that Diddy has run a criminal enterprise since at least 2008, under which he “abused, threatened, and coerced women and others around him to fulfill his sexual desires, protect his reputation, and conceal his conduct,” largely during marathon multi-partner sex sessions the rapper calls “freak-offs.” Diddy and his associates have been accused of drugging women and forcing them to have sex with male sex workers while filming them. The prosecution, an all-women legal team led by Maurene Comey, questioned 34 witnesses during the trial, presenting photos, videos, pages of text messages and email transcripts, and financial records as evidence against Diddy. Key testimony in the trial came from singer, songwriter, and former Diddy collaborator Dawn Richard. Richard alleged that, during that period, Diddy physically and verbally assaulted her during years spent working together on the reality show Making the Band and in the groups Danity Kane and Diddy - Dirty Money. (She brought the same allegations in a lawsuit filed last year.) During the trial, Richard also testified to witnessing Diddy physically abuse Cassie on numerous occasions, including an alleged 2009 incident during which she watched Diddy “beat [Cassie] on the ground in front of us.” Richard added, “I was scared that if I intervened, I might get [it] worse. Cudi testified that his brief relationship with Cassie infuriated Diddy to the point that he arranged for a Molotov cocktail to be thrown into Cudi's car. Cudi claims that Diddy had his Porsche 911 convertible blown up as a form of retaliation for dating Cassie. The prosecution also presented numerous former employees of Diddy, who claimed to have witnessed the rapper engaging in physical abuse and drug use; former escorts who testified about getting paid by Diddy for the alleged “freak-offs”; Cassie's mother, who recalled that Cassie informed her, in 2011, that Diddy was threatening to release sex tapes of her; and several others. The defense focused on framing Diddy's alleged victims as willing participants. Diddy's attorneys depicted Jane as a consenting sex partner and showed text messages intended to present her as an enthusiastic participant in sex acts with Diddy and male escorts. The rapper's legal team also emphasized text messages between Cassie and Diddy during the lead-up to a 2016 “freak-off,” claiming that Cassie planned the event, and pointing out texts that suggested she consented to participation. Additionally, the defense presented drugs (or withdrawal from them) and jealousy as pretexts for Diddy's alleged violence.

It's opening day of Paul Thomas Anderson's “One Battle After Another,” and Alejandro González Iñárritu is worried about how it will play with audiences. “I just cross my fingers that people go in millions,” he told me. We are talking on Zoom, and of course, Iñárritu is rooting for PTA: He's a fellow auteur who makes expensive original movies with movie stars. For his part, Iñárritu just wrapped principal photography in April on an untitled comedy ensemble led by Tom Cruise and produced by Legendary for Warner Bros. The Mexican filmmaker is directing his first English-language movie since 2015's “The Revenant,” which won “One Battle After Another” star Leonardo DiCaprio his first Oscar. The untitled Cruise comedy, shot in 35-millimeter VistaVision by three-time Oscar-winner Emmanuel “Chivo” Lubezki, should come out sometime next fall. Related Stories ‘Anemone,' ‘After the Hunt' Shake Up New York Film Festival as ‘One Battle' Heads Into Second Weekend — Screen Talk ‘The French Italian' Review: A Neurotic Neighbor Revenge Comedy Overflows with Adult Theater Kid Energy “We're going to finish in February, March,” he said. “We still have a long way [in] post-production.” Even though both Iñárritu and Cruise are powerful, controlling perfectionists on a movie production, “it was the most amazing, unexpected, sweet, gentle relation that I have had on a set,” Iñárritu said. Filmmaking has been his life for 40 years. I have never seen somebody so devoted. I was happy to share with him that passion. And at the same time, we built an incredible relation of mutual trust. People will see a new kind of thing. It was blessed, and not only him, but all the cast: Riz Ahmed, Sandra Hüller, John Goodman, and Jesse Plemons. But we are not Zooming to talk about Cruise. This May, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of “Amores Perros,”  Iñárritu's daring triptych debut feature, shot in Mexico City and introducing Gael García Bernal, the director screened the restored 4K version at Cannes to a packed house. The movie holds up: It's vivid, loud, assaultive, and violent, from the visceral dogfights (no animals were harmed) to the glam model (Goya Toledo) who is forever mutilated in a car crash. A brand-new 5.1 surround sound mix by Jon Taylor at NBCUniversal StudioPost enhances the intensity. “I hadn't seen the film complete in 25 years,” he said. So we have to restore a lot of things. [I thought] what young man did that? It hasn't become a flaccid film.” “Amores Perros” played Cannes 25 years ago, but not in Competition, where it was roundly rejected before it went to the selection committee. Luckily, it was invited to Critics' Week, won the Grand Prix, and landed a North American release in 2001 from Lionsgate. It launched the careers of Iñárritu, 19-year-old García Bernal, and Prieto, among others. After the screening, a grateful and teary García Bernal said, “It's a film that we all were transformed, and even the way in Mexico we were perceived, the films were transformed.” “Even when we were a very small independent film in a very small section that is not even official, it became the film that everybody wanted to see,” said Iñárritu. Maybe one would wind up in theaters. Also based in Mexico City, novelist Guillermo Arriaga wrote the screenplay for “Amores Perros,” “an incredible, solid, complex script,” said Iñárritu. So we can see and observe: low, high, wherever. We were having access to many things.” The “Amores Perros” team had been working together making commercials and videos for seven years. “There was a new government coming, that threw out the party dictatorship of 70 years. This film came into the right moment.” Iñárritu has written an essay about making the film for Mack Books' just-published “Amores Perros” book, which also showcases unseen set photography, critical essays, and production documents. Back in 2020, “Amores Perros,” which runs two hours and 37 minutes, was edited down from 1 million feet of material. The director found out that his 1 million feet of dailies were in storage in Mexico's National Autonomous University archive. “It was beautiful to see how, when I start seeing all [that] was left out, how many films were there within the film, and watching this material with a new gaze. And that's the beginning of this installation. It's 35-millimeter projectors in a labyrinth of dark rooms, with these big guys projecting material like a magic lantern. “My obsession is the grammatical film language,” he said. Those are my bricks that sustain some clarity during [filming], and it helped me out. It's an exercise that takes me days and months to get it all, but it's homework that goes deep for me to understand what I'm dealing with. Mubi will re-release the film this month in theaters all over Latin America, and make it available globally on its streaming platform on October 24. While the filmmaker never made any money on the film, which he invested in, he now owns about 75 percent. “They're one of the few streamers that are supporting independent filmmakers. While the life of a filmmaker is peripatetic at best, Iñárritu and his wife, with their two children out of the nest, are trying to decide where to live. So I lived in Mexico City for one year and a half. Then I finished shooting the last film at Warner Bros. It's a difficult moment in the world, and that decision is important for us. Things have changed a lot, as you know.” We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

Leonardo DiCaprio Pays Tribute to Jane Goodall: "We Have Lost a True Hero for the Planet" He also had a part in Dennis Hopper's critical and financial disaster The Last Movie (1971) and made a short documentary about the experience working in Peru with Hopper, Peter Fonda and Kris Kristofferson called The Last Movie Movie. Mitchum's mom was determined to keep him out of show business as long as possible, but when he was 16, he was cast as Robert's younger brother, Robin Doolin, in the cult classic Thunder Road. (The part was originally written for Elvis Presley, a family friend of the Mitchums, but he wanted too much money.) Also produced by Robert, the movie, about Southern whiskey runners pitted against federal agents and organized crime, was filled with car chases and stunts. He also appeared with his father in the 1961 war comedy The Last Time I Saw Archie, directed by and starring Jack Webb. Named for his paternal grandfather, James Robin Spence Mitchum was born in Los Angeles on May 8, 1941. When Dorothy went into labor, Robert was appearing as a Russian peasant in a small theater production, and he rushed to the hospital in full make-up. By 1943, Robert was making enough money from acting to rent a house nearby — just in time for the birth of Jim's brother, Christopher, who would also become an actor. James appeared in his first film, Raoul Walsh's Colorado Territory (1949), when he was 8, then attended University High School in West Los Angeles, where his classmates included Frank Sinatra Jr. He passed on college and a potential career in baseball to pursue acting. While he was residing in Santa Barbara as the co-founder of a publishing company, Mitchum married Vivian Ferrand in 1985, and they moved to Paradise Valley, Arizona, where he managed his parents' quarter horse ranch, overseeing the breeding and racing operations. They had two kids, Brian and Caitlin Ann, before divorcing in 1995. After Robert Mitchum's death in July 1997 at age 79, Jim continued to breed racing quarter horses at his ranch in Skull Valley. In recent years, he developed a line of premium moonshine, traditional corn whiskey and Robert's Rye whiskey in tribute to his dad. His life will be celebrated privately by the family. Robert Mitchum was known for his performances in such films as Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo (1944), Out of the Past (1947), The Night of the Hunter (1955), Not as a Stranger (1955), Cape Fear (1962), Ryan's Daughter (1970) and Farewell, My Lovely (1975), to name just a few.

[Editor's note: This interview contains mild spoilers for “The Ice Tower,” now in theaters from Yellow Veil Pictures.] “Mulholland Drive” meets “Last Year at Marienbad” and the snow-flecked sagas of Hans Christian Andersen in French writer/director Lucile Hadžihalilović‘s coolly drawn, amorous, and elusive industry fairy tale, “The Ice Tower.” In other words, an irresistible hypnosis for cinephiles. Hadžihalilović, the wife of director Gaspar Noé (who also stars in this movie), directs her ninth feature and first with Marion Cotillard in 20 years after the eventual Oscar winner's breakout movie “Innocence” in 2004. Cotillard here plays Cristina, a fading movie actress on set in the mountains of France, making an adaptation of “The Snow Queen.” Meanwhile, a teenage runaway named Jeanne (Clara Pacini) stumbles into the production after fleeing an orphanage, taking on a plum role in the film and falling under the wing and spell of Cristina, with whom she develops an obsession. One that becomes mutual, as a mother/daughter dynamic emerges, as does an erotic frisson, despite their age difference.

Iñárritu on Revisiting ‘Amores Perros' After 25 Years, and His New Tom Cruise Movie: ‘He Will Surprise the World' “The Ice Tower,” which won a Silver Bear Award for Outstanding Artistic Contribution from Todd Haynes' 2025 Berlin International Film Festival jury, opens in select theaters this weekend and is a must-see for fans of hypnotic cinema, the theremin-like soundtrack and woozy, dream-tinged cinematography by Jonathan Ricquebourg putting the audience into a trance. Hadžihalilović, as she told IndieWire over a Zoom interview in September, doesn't mind if you nod off or fall asleep or get lost in the trance of the film. It's maybe even better, because you will have a wonderful or very scary dreams that can help the experience.” Despite the 20 years between “Innocence” and this film, Cotillard and Hadžihalilović hadn't exactly kept in touch, but a chance meeting at a party sparked her casting in the movie. “We didn't keep any relationship between the two films,” Hadžihalilović said. “But it's funny how because of that, I saw her so many times onscreen, it's like my relationship to her was going on because I could see her, I could see her many faces, all the emotions, the things you can express. “It was kind of a coincidence that you had this project, and then suddenly you ran into me, which was kind of like serendipity. She talked to me about the project, and I got so excited. I love working with people I already worked with.” Cotillard also said that “Innocence,” in which she starred as a boarding school headmistress overseeing a nefarious operation involving its students, is her father's favorite of all her films. The below interview combines a conversation with Hadžihalilović and Cotillard over Zoom as well as a Q&A I moderated with Cotillard at the IFC Center in New York. IndieWire: In this movie, Lucile Hadžihalilović's husband Gaspar Noé plays the movie director running the '70s film set, this recognizable archetype of the kind of filmmaker who mansplains Hitchcock to ingénues. He asked me once to do a horror film. Horror movies are hard for me to watch. I love that this character in this very enigmatic, dramatic movie is someone who is out of a comedy. Clara Pacini, who plays Jeanne and your protégé in this movie, is a real discovery. Cotillard: She didn't need my help. The first time we met, she came to my house, and it was snowing that day, and it was really not a snowing period, so we thought it was funny. So I was very intimated by her and also by, when I saw her, first of all she plays a teenager but she's much older. It was better for the things that we had to do, but I couldn't even watch her in the eyes because I had all those scenes in mind and I was just thinking, oh my god, what am I going to do with her? The character is really trying to destroy this poor girl, and I felt very shy. It was the first time we met, and it really created this very special atmosphere and energy between us that you can feel in the movie. There is an erotic frisson between Jeanne and Cristina throughout the movie despite their age difference and daughter-mother-like relationship. But that culminates in a sexual assault at the movie's end. Cotillard: Jeanne is fascinated by Cristina and the Queen. Cristina is fascinated by this young woman, and it has this feeling of being a vampire and wanting to suck the youth out of her. She feels good to see that this girl is fascinated by her in a period of time where her acting career is going down because of her age. She didn't have a mother, so the mother figure is something that she doesn't want to look at, that she doesn't want to be. When they have this conversation on the couch, where she talks about her mother and that she has this feeling that she would see Cristina as a mom, then something twists inside of her and then she wants love, she wants to develop this relationship of love to go against and to not open the door to a mother relationship. And at the same time, it's like she wants to eat her. Was this scene difficult for you, Marion? Cotillard: We really worked on the kiss as a kiss that becomes someone who wants to swallow the other person, and it was very intense that day because honestly I didn't like that scene. We had a very strong connection with Clara that day because I wanted her to feel good. But again, you go through the feelings of your character. Hadžihalilović: When I began to write the script … I had not so much thought that it would be a real erotic or sexual bond between them. There is this attraction from girls to women, and this pleasure to be in the company of women. We had [an intimacy coordinator] on set. We knew it was super safe, and I really talked to Clara about it and wanted her to feel comfortable and to feel free to say no if she didn't think it was OK for her. We really created a choreography so you know exactly what to do, and it gives you the freedom to experience the scene and be fully in your character because you know exactly what's going to happen. So you wouldn't work without an intimacy coordinator again, I'd imagine, though you've obviously had many experiences without one. Any sex scenes today, I would never go on set with a director telling me and the other actors or actress, “Oh let's do it, let's see how you feel.” No. I think it's a very important thing to really choreograph those scenes. “The Ice Tower” is now in select theaters from Yellow Veil Pictures.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taylor Swift has released her new album, The Life of a Showgirl. Tonight all these lives converge hereThe mosaics of laughter and cocktails of tearsWhere fraternal souls sing identical thingsAnd it's beautifulIt's rapturous.It is frightening.———I can't tell you how proud I am to share this with you, an album that just feels so right. A forever thank you goes out to my mentors and friends Max and Shellback for helping me paint this self portrait.If you thought the big show was wild, perhaps you should come and take a look behind the curtain...The Life of a Showgirl is out now. In a statement on social media, the George Michael estate said, “We were delighted when Taylor Swift and her team approached us earlier this year about incorporating an interpolation of George Michael's classic song ‘Father Figure' into a brand new song of the same title to be featured on her forthcoming album. George Michael Entertainment wishes Taylor every success with The Life of a Showgirl and ‘Father Figure. Since releasing The Tortured Poets Department in 2024, she concluded her record-breaking, 149-date Eras Tour, which reportedly grossed over $2 billion in ticket sales and spawned both a companion book and a three-hour concert film. In May, Swift announced she had bought back the master recordings for her first six studio albums, which she'd been steadily re-recording as the Taylor's Version series.
