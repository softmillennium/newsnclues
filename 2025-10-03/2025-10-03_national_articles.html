                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Five years after protests roiled Portland, Oregon, the city known for its history of civil disobedience is again at the center of a political maelstrom as it braces for the arrival of federal troops being deployed by President Donald Trump. Months of demonstrations outside Portland's immigration detention facility have escalated since Trump said last week he was sending federal troops to the city, which he described as “War ravaged.” Police made a few arrests late Thursday after fights broke out in the crowd, including of conservative influencer Nick Sortor on a disorderly conduct charge. “Last night, the arrests that we made, we made based upon probable cause, not based upon individuals,” Police Chief Bob Day told a news conference Friday. “There is no political bias associated with our enforcement.” Meanwhile, a federal judge heard arguments — but did not immediately rule — on whether to temporarily block Trump's call-up of 200 Oregon National Guard members, which the administration said is needed to protect the ICE facility and other federal buildings. The escalation of federal law enforcement in Portland, population 636,000 and Oregon's largest city, follows similar crackdowns to combat crime in other cities, including Chicago, Baltimore and Memphis. Sortor, 27, who's a regular guest on Fox News and whose X profile has more than 1 million followers, was arrested Thursday night with two other people outside the city's Immigration and Customs Enforcement building. The Multnomah County District Attorney's Office said it was reviewing the case and would make a decision on whether to proceed with charges before Sortor's arraignment Monday. Portland police said they moved into the crowd to make arrests as fights broke out. Sorter was released Friday on his own recognizance, according to Multnomah County Sheriff's Office's online records. An email seeking comment from Sortor sent Friday went unanswered and no one answered phone numbers listed for him. In a post on X on Friday morning, Sortor said his arrest proved that Portland Police are corrupt and controlled by “vioIent Antifa thugs who terrorize the streets.” Army veteran and Portland City Council member Mitch Green, second from left, stands with protesters outside a federal courthouse on Friday, Oct. 3, 2025, in Portland, Ore., before a federal court hearing on Oregon's bid to temporarily block President Donald Trump's deployment of the National Guard to Portland is held inside. Viral videos captured militarized federal officers, often unidentified, arresting people and hustling them into unmarked vehicles. At the same time, Portland police were unable to keep ahead of splinter groups of black-clad protesters who broke off and roamed the downtown area, at times breaking windows, spraying graffiti and setting small fires in moments that were also captured on video and shared widely on social media. The shooter, Michael Forest Reinoehl, was himself later shot and killed when he pulled a gun as a federal task force attempted to apprehend him near Lacey, Washington.

(AP Photo/Jenny Kane) There's been a sustained and low-level protest outside the ICE facility — far from the downtown clashes of 2020 — since Trump took office in January. Those protests flared in June, during the national protests surrounding Trump's military parade, but have rarely attracted more than a few dozen people in the past two months. Trump has once more turned his attention to the city, calling Portland “war ravaged,” and a “war zone” that is “burning down” and like “living in hell.” But local officials have suggested that many of his claims and social media posts appear to rely on images from 2020. Under a new mayor, the city has reduced crime, and the downtown has seen a decrease in homeless encampments and increased foot traffic. Most violent crime around the country has actually declined in recent years, including in Portland, where a recent report from the Major Cities Chiefs Association found that homicides from January through June decreased by 51% this year compared to the same period in 2024. People protest outside a federal courthouse on Friday, Oct. 3, 2025, in Portland, Ore., before a federal court hearing on Oregon's bid to temporarily block President Donald Trump's deployment of the National Guard to Portland is held inside. On Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Karin J. Immergut heard arguments on whether to block the deployment of National Guard troops in Portland, where they would defend federal buildings such as the ICE facility from vandalism. Oregon sued to stop the deployment on Sept. 28 after Democratic Gov. Immergut said she would rule later Friday or over the weekend. Meanwhile, the National Guard troops — from communities not too far from Portland — were training on the Oregon Coast in anticipation of deployment. Thursday's arrest of Sortor, however, likely means more federal law enforcement presence in Portland. In an X post, which reposted a video from the protest and a photo of Sortor being detained, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said there would be an immediate increase in federal resources to the city with enhanced Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement resources.</p>

The American Principles Project released a seven-figure ad tying Abigail Spanberger to Tier III sex offender Richard Cox, warning voters that her policies put girls at risk. FIRST ON FOX: A new seven-figure ad in Virginia's governor's race is drawing comparisons to the infamous Willie Horton spot of 1988 amid record early voting in the Old Dominion State.The ad, produced by the American Principles Project, attacks Democrat Abigail Spanberger over transgender policies and warns of the dangers of biological men in women's spaces. The spot points to Richard Cox, a Tier III sex offender in Arlington County who has been charged multiple times with exposing himself in girls' locker rooms. The ad says Spanberger's record and her opposition to Gov. Glenn Youngkin's guidelines for transgender students would let it happen again. "The case of sexual deviant Richard Cox preying upon young girls in Virginia is enraging to any decent person – but not to Abigail Spanberger," Terry Schilling, President of the American Principles Project, told Fox News Digital. "SPANBERGER DEFENDS ABORTION AD CRITICIZING SEARS AFTER BERNIE WARNS AGAINST HIGHLIGHTING ISSUE The campaign ad contrasts Republican Winsome Earle-Sears with Democrat Abigail Spanberger on crime and safety. "She's avoided answering any and all questions about it, and the answer is obvious because this situation is only possible because of Spanberger's radical transgender policy agenda. Cox has been a repeat offender for over 30 years. He was allowed to enter women's private spaces where little girls are vulnerable, and no one stopped him," Schilling added. "If Abigail Spanberger is elected governor of Virginia, she will repeal all protections for women in Virginia and put even more young girls in danger. The reason we are spending $1 million on this ad is because every Virginia voter should know that Abigail Spanberger will endanger their daughters." APP has run similar ads in other battleground states, positioning itself as a defender of families and warning against policies it claims "confuse[s] young children about changing their gender." By airing the ad now, APP hopes to frame Spanberger as out of step with Virginia voters before Election Day.ELON MUSK WADES INTO VIRGINIA TRANSGENDER BATHROOM CLASH, SAYS DEM GOV CANDIDATE WRONGLY ‘BLAMING' TRUMP A campaign ad in Virginia attacks Democrat Abigail Spanberger over what it calls radical transgender policies. Bush defeated Dukakis by seven points nationally, and the ad became a defining example of how the GOP can use crime to win races. Spanberger has voted for the Equality Act in Congress and opposed Youngkin's guidelines, but local school boards control locker room access. "Convicted sex offender Richard Cox is a predator who should be in jail — and that's exactly where he is," a spokeperson for Spanberger's campaign told Fox News Digital. "Abigail is a parent of three daughters in Virginia public schools and a former federal law enforcement officer who went after child predators. Nothing is more important to her than the safety of Virginia's kids. "As Governor, Abigail will work with state and local law enforcement officers to keep Virginia kids safe and make sure sex offenders are prevented from preying on children and prosecuted for their crimes." The American Principles Project released an ad tying Abigail Spanberger to sex offenders and criticizing her transgender policy record. Cox remains in custody at the Arlington County jail on multiple pending charges, according to the Arlington County Sheriff's Office inmate database. "Abigail Spanberger's policies enabled Richard Cox to prey on women and girls. No amount of political damage control can erase that record," Schilling told Fox News Digital in response to the Spanberger campaign. Youngkin's recent executive order barring males from female private spaces. "Republicans argue that safety and cultural issues are resonating more deeply with parents across the state, particularly after Youngkin's win in 2021, which many linked to parental rights in education. More ads are expected as the campaign heats up and voters in Virginia send in record numbers of early ballots.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth speaks to senior military leaders at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Tuesday, Sept. 30, 2025 in Quantico, Va. (Andrew Harnik/Pool via AP) WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Friday that he ordered another strike on a small boat he accused of carrying drugs in the waters off Venezuela, expanding what the Trump administration has declared is an “armed conflict” with cartels. In a post on social media, Hegseth asserted that the “vessel was trafficking narcotics” and those aboard were “narco-terrorists.” He said the strike killed four men but offered no details on who they were or what group they belonged to, following the U.S. designation of several Latin American cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. President Donald Trump said in his own social media post that the boat was “loaded with enough drugs to kill 25 TO 50 THOUSAND PEOPLE” and implied it was “entering American Territory” while off the coast of Venezuela. It is the fourth deadly strike in the Caribbean and the latest since revelations that Trump told lawmakers he was treating drug traffickers as unlawful combatants and military force was required to combat them. That assertion of presidential war powers sets the stage for expanded action and raises questions about how far the administration will go without sign-off from Congress. “Blowing them up without knowing who's on the boat is a terrible policy, and it should end,” said Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a consistent and harsh critic of the U.S. strikes. “The President determined that the United States is in a non-international armed conflict with these designated terrorist organizations,” according to the memo sent to Congress. “What could be a bigger defense of this country than keeping out this poison that's killing thousands of Americans every year?” Risch said Friday. “We see it and feel it, as they murder our countries' citizens in summary extrajudicial executions,” she said during a conference in Venezuela's capital, Caracas, focused on colonialism in the West. Meanwhile, President Nicolás Maduro did not explicitly mention the strikes, but he told conference attendees that his country is ready to defend itself. “And if it is necessary to move from an unarmed struggle to an armed struggle, this people will do so. Colombian President Gustavo Petro, a leftist leader who has clashed with the Trump administration, accused the U.S. of committing “murder” and urged the victims' families to “join forces.” “There are no narco-terrorists on the boats,” he posted on X after the strike was announced. “Drug traffickers live in the U.S., Europe and Dubai. On that boat are poor Caribbean youth.” Video of Friday's strike posted online showed a small boat moving in open water when it suddenly explodes, with water splashing all around it. With it, at least three of the strikes have now been carried out on vessels that U.S. officials said had originated from Venezuela. The strikes followed a buildup of U.S. maritime forces in the Caribbean unlike any seen in recent times. The Navy's presence in the region — eight warships with over 5,000 sailors and Marines — has been pretty stable for weeks, according to two defense officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing operations. Posts about all the subsequent strikes, including Friday's, have not provided any details about what organizations have been targeted.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge in Tennessee ruled Friday that the foreign national from El Salvador, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, has shown a sufficient evidentiary basis to proceed with claims that his criminal prosecution was brought for “vindictive” and politically retaliatory reasons by the Trump administration. U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw, an appointee of former President Barack Obama based in Nashville, granted Abrego Garcia's request for discovery and an evidentiary hearing, writing that the totality of events, including public comments by senior administration officials, raised a “realistic likelihood of vindictiveness.” The court stopped short of dismissing the charges but said more evidence must be considered before deciding whether to throw out the case entirely. The ruling applies only to Abrego Garcia's criminal case in Tennessee, where he is charged with conspiracy and unlawful transportation of undocumented immigrants. In court filings, federal prosecutors have accused Abrego Garcia of being a “known MS-13 gang member” who has “personally participated in violent crime, including murder.” They claim he trafficked women, children, firearms, and narcotics — and that he is the subject of an ongoing investigation into solicitation of child pornography. DHS has described him as a “serial domestic abuser” and “child predator,” noting a previous restraining order that was filed against him by his U.S.-citizen wife, who supports his effort to remain in the country. Crenshaw noted that Trump administration and Justice Department officials “celebrated” the criminal charges in public statements and that Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche “strikingly” admitted in a television interview that the investigation began after a Maryland judge questioned the legality of Abrego Garcia's deportation. “This could be direct evidence of vindictiveness,” Crenshaw wrote, adding that Blanche's “remarkable statements” may establish that the charges were motivated by retaliation for Abrego Garcia's legal challenge, “rather than a genuine desire to prosecute him for alleged criminal misconduct.” Abrego Garcia's attorneys have long argued that DHS and DOJ officials targeted their client for successfully suing to return to the U.S. and embarrassed the administration's immigration enforcement strategy. “The government is attempting to use this case — and this Court — to punish Mr. Abrego for successfully fighting his unlawful removal,” they wrote in an earlier filing. Abrego Garcia remains in ICE custody in Pennsylvania pending the outcome of both the immigration and criminal proceedings, though the government has indicated he will be removed to a third country if he loses his appeal of his immigration case.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Terence “Bud” Crawford, left, fights David Avanesyan during a WBO welterweight title boxing bout on Saturday, Dec. 10, 2022, in Omaha, Neb. From left, Omaha, Neb., Police Chief Todd Schmaderer, Mayor John Ewing and Ewing's chief of staff, Tom Warren, hold a news conference Friday, Oct. 3, 2025, to address the traffic stop of champion boxer Terence Crawford, who was pulled from his car by police at gunpoint just hours after the city held a parade and celebration in this honor. (AP) — The police chief of Nebraska's largest city acknowledged Friday that police nationwide are more likely to pull Black people out of their cars at gunpoint than other racial groups as Omaha grapples with growing outrage over champion boxer Terence “Bud” Crawford being ordered out of his car at gunpoint only hours after the city held a downtown celebration in his honor. That is nationwide,” Police Chief Tobb Schmaderer said at a news conference to address an internal investigation into Crawford's traffic stop. Omaha Sen. Terrell McKinney, one of three Black state lawmakers in the Nebraska Legislature and a vocal critic of Omaha police and the state's justice system, said he was disappointed — but not surprised — by the police stop. “I urge the people to keep speaking out and demanding real change boldly and unapologetically,” McKinney said in a Facebook post earlier this week. “Our lives are at risk, and we have endured oppression for far too long.” According to a U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics' special report released in 2022, Black and Hispanic people were more likely than white people to experience the threat or use of force by police in 2020. Schmaderer has long been an advocate of community policing that aims to build trust between officers and the public they patrol. He said Friday that he understands there is a lot of anger in the community over the treatment of Crawford — a favorite son of Omaha after making history by becoming the first male boxer to capture three unified division titles. But he said a nearly completed internal investigation into the traffic stop shows the officers involved did not violate department policy. According to their reports, the officers spotted a high-performance sedan without license plates pull out of a downtown parking garage around 1:30 a.m. Sunday and quickly accelerate to more than twice the 25 mph (40 kph) speed limit. Schmaderer said the initial interaction was cordial, which he assessed through body camera footage. Crawford, who was driving, told the officer at his window that the car was new and “had gotten away from him.” At that point, a member of Crawford's security team who was in the passenger seat told the officer at his window that he was carrying a legal handgun, Schmaderer said. Schmaderer said Crawford and the others were handcuffed for about 10 minutes. Police confirmed all occupants of the vehicle were legally permitted to carry firearms and let them go after about 30 minutes, ticketing Crawford on suspicion of reckless driving. Crawford's spokesperson said Friday that the boxer had no comment. Schmaderer said he will not be sharing police video of the stop unless Crawford agrees to it. We don't have an officer-involved shooting, and it's generally not our protocol to release that footage under those circumstances,” he said. Crawford's stop by police came after the city held a parade through downtown streets in Crawford's honor, followed by a party to celebrate his 38th birthday at a live music venue near where the stop occurred. The celebration came after Crawford earned the unified super middleweight championship with his unanimous decision victory over Canelo Alvarez on Sept. 13 in Las Vegas.

Police in Michigan released body camera video from officers who responded to the shooting at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, eventually killing the gunman. Thomas Jacob Sanford is accused of killing four people and injuring eight at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, during Sunday service. Authorities say he rammed his truck into the building and opened fire, setting fire to the church while services were going on. The Grand Blanc Township Police Department provided Fox News Digital with body camera video from officers who responded to the shooting. "Get on the ground," one law enforcement officer yells at Sanford. Thomas Jacob Sanford killed four people and injured eight, according to officials. "Shoot him," another officer can be heard saying. Several shots can be heard before Sanford is seen lifeless in the Church parking lot. Grand Blanc Police Chief William Renye said during a news conference that the video shows "what law enforcement is trained to do." White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in an update Monday that Sanford hated Mormons. "Based on my conversations with the FBI director, all they know right now is this was an individual who hated people of the Mormon faith, and they are trying to understand more about this, how premeditated it was, how much planning went into it, whether he left a note. All of those questions have yet to be answered but certainly will be answered by the FBI," Leavitt told "Fox & Friends" "Local police officers were on the ground of this scene within minutes and neutralized this shooter, no doubt saving lives, and they should be commended. Our police officers are heroes, and this president will always respect them and support them," Leavitt continued. Fox News Digital's Pilar Arias and Hanna Panreck contributed to this report.

Trump advisor Corey Lewandowski responded to the news that Bad Bunny, who attacked ICE raids, would be performing at the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said immigration authorities will enforce the law at Super Bowl 60 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, before criticizing the NFL, which she said was "so weak." Noem was speaking with Benny Johnson on "The Benny Show" when she was asked about Bad Bunny, the Puerto Rican reggaeton artist slated to perform in the halftime show and the presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Bad Bunny, a three-time Grammy winner whose real name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, said last month he would not perform in the United States during his upcoming tour due to concerns about potential ICE raids at the shows. Noem said immigration authorities will enforce the law at Super Bowl 60 in California. That's what America's about," Noem told Johnson. Noem said those attending big game should be law-abiding Americans "who love this country." Johnson asked Noem about the decision to have Bad Bunny perform, given his views on ICE. "They suck, and we'll win," Noem said of the NFL. "God will bless us, and we'll stand and be proud of ourselves at the end of the day. Bad Bunny attends the 2025 Met Gala Celebrating "Superfine: Tailoring Black Style" at Metropolitan Museum of Art May 5, 2025, in New York City. Earlier in the week, Trump advisor Corey Lewandowski warned ICE agents would be present at the game. "There is nowhere you can provide safe haven to people who are in this country illegally," Lewandowski said on "The Benny Show." "Not the Super Bowl and nowhere else. Know that this is a very real situation under this administration, which is contrary to how it used to be." "But there was the issue of — like, f---ing ICE could be outside [my concert]. And it's something that we were talking about and very concerned about," he told i-D last month. Fox News Digital has reached out to the NFL for comment.

GRAND BLANC TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) — Police responding to a mass shooting at a Michigan church quickly encountered the gunman and killed him after repeatedly demanding, “Drop the gun! Drop it now!” according to bodycam video released Friday. A 47-second video was released by police, five days after four people were killed inside The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc Township, near Flint. The gunman, Thomas “Jake” Sanford, also died. Chief William Renye praised the “very courageous actions” of a state conservation officer and another local officer who ran to the sounds of gunfire. “This is what law enforcement is trained to do, and this is how law enforcement should respond to these incidents,” Renye said. Renye did not release video showing police near Sanford after he was killed, saying he was mindful that the Sanford family also has suffered. Drop it now!” One of the officers tells the other officer, “I've got your back. He said the entire incident lasted less than four minutes from the time of the first 911 call, not eight as initially reported. Sanford had rammed his pickup truck into the chapel, repeatedly fired shots and set the building on fire last Sunday. Besides the deaths, eight people were injured. ▶ Stay up to date with the latest U.S. news by signing up to our WhatsApp channel.

Noem said she and her team were denied access while seeking a 'quick bathroom break' at Broadview Municipal Building as tensions flared outside a nearby Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem said Friday she and her staff were denied entry to a government building in a Chicago suburb, where they attempted to stop for a "bathroom break" as federal agents clashed with protesters outside a nearby immigration facility. In a post on X, Noem said her team was denied access to the Village of Broadview Municipal Building, located about 12 miles west of downtown Chicago, and blasted Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker's administration for its treatment of federal agents. "My team and I were just blocked from accessing the Village of Broadview Municipal Building in Illinois," Noem said. "We were stopping for a quick bathroom break. The Village of Broadview receives at least $1 million in federal funding every year. This is how JB Pritzker and his cronies treat our law enforcement. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Friday she and her staff were denied entry to a government building in a Chicago suburb where they attempted to stop for a "bathroom break." before Noem calmly replies, "OK, all right, thank you," and walks away. Village officials said Noem showed up unannounced Friday morning seeking a meeting with Mayor Katrina Thompson, who was out of the building at the time. "Since DHS Secretary Kristi Noem appeared this morning, unannounced, at Broadview's Village Hall asking for a meeting while Mayor Katrina Thompson was out of the building, the mayor returned her visit," Village of Broadview spokesperson David Ormsby said in a statement. Noem said her team were denied access to the Village of Broadview Municipal Building, located about 12 miles west of downtown Chicago. However, DHS officials insisted the stop was not about a meeting at all. This is insane," DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News. The bathroom dispute came as tensions flared outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) processing facility in Broadview, where more than a dozen people were arrested by federal agents during demonstrations. Fox News observed agents firing pepper balls, tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds blocking federal operations. Pritzker accused Noem of overseeing federal enforcement tactics that he said had violated rights and traumatized families in Illinois. He also said she should "no longer be able to step foot inside the State of Illinois without any form of public accountability." A demonstrator is detained as people protest outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Broadview facility in Chicago Oct. 3, 2025. "Last time when the secretary was here, she snuck in during the early morning to film social media videos and fled before sunrise," Pritzker's office said. "It's been nearly 45 days since Secretary Noem has held an official press conference, so it's time she faces the public and takes questions from the press to be held accountable for the Trump administration's gross misconduct. "Illinois is not a photo opportunity or war zone, it's a sovereign state where our people deserve rights, respect and answers." McLaughlin snapped back on behalf of DHS, accusing Pritzker of failing to protect Illinois residents from violent offenders. "Grow up and start protecting the people of your own state," McLaughlin said in a statement. The Village of Broadview did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A public school district in Des Moines, Iowa, sued a consulting firm on Friday for “failing to properly vet” a former superintendent detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement last week. The school board alleges the firm breached an executive search agreement by neglecting to disclose “all known information of a positive or negative nature regarding any candidate,” namely, Roberts. “JG Consulting materially breached the Agreement by, among other things, failing to properly vet Roberts and by referring Roberts as a candidate when he could not lawfully hold the position,” the lawsuit states. She said the consulting firm should have done a better background check on Roberts, considering public reporting has unearthed his criminal history and immigration status since his arrest. “It's clear that people are identifying and finding information in a matter of hours,” Norris said. “We are pursuing legal action as allowed by law. Last Friday, ICE detained Roberts and confiscated his loaded handgun, fixed-blade hunting knife, and $3,000 in cash found in his vehicle. He had lived and worked in the United States illegally without any work authorization for years. Roberts was the superintendent from July 2023 until his resignation on Tuesday. His rap sheet includes multiple charges related to firearms violations, criminal possession of narcotics, and reckless driving over the past 30 years, according to the Department of Homeland Security. “Ian Andre Roberts, a criminal illegal alien with multiple weapons charges and a drug trafficking charge, should have never been able to work around children,” DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said. “When ICE officers arrested this Superintendent, he was in possession of an illegal handgun, a hunting knife, and nearly $3,000 in cash,” she added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Administration officials have argued that self-deportation incentives are more cost effective, given the high price tag of immigrant detention and deportation. A notice sent to legal service providers Friday by the Department of Health and Human Services, seen by CNN, said the administration “will provide a one-time resettlement support stipend of $2,500 U.S. Dollars to unaccompanied alien children, 14 years of age and older, who have elected to voluntarily depart the United States as of the date of this notice and moving forward,” adding that the “benefit is intended to support reintegration efforts following departure.” CNN reached out to HHS, which is charged with caring for unaccompanied migrant children. “Any payment to support a return home would be provided after an immigration judge grants the request and the individual arrives in their country of origin. Access to financial support when returning home would assist should they choose that option,” the spokesperson added. Trump administration officials have increasingly focused on migrant children who arrived in the US southern border alone and are awaiting to be placed with a sponsor, typically a parent or relative, in the United States. As of October 2, there were around 2,100 kids in HHS custody. In late August, the Trump administration prepared dozens of Guatemalan children to be sent back to their home country — a move that was temporarily blocked by a federal judge. Declarations from some parents of the children in Guatemala revealed that they were unaware their child was being deported and raised concern over their safety if returned. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, which has been in place for more than two decades, provides protections for unaccompanied migrant children who arrive and reside in the US, including being screened to see if they are victims of human trafficking or have a credible fear of persecution in their home country. Generally, kids in custody are not affirmatively offered the option to leave voluntarily, and those who request it must have it approved by an immigration judge. ICE said kids, in this case, will also go before an immigration judge, who are there to ensure the child knows what it means, are making the choice of their own free will, and aren't being put in harm's way. “Voluntary departure has always been an option for unaccompanied children and when this option is explained by an attorney who has the child's best interest in mind, the risks and benefits can be fully explored. There is no legitimate reason for the government to affirmatively provide children with this option and incentivize it with a financial payoff,” said Neha Desai, managing director of Children's Human Rights & Dignity at the National Center for Youth Law, in a statement. Earlier this year, the administration separately moved to rapidly deport some migrant children who arrived in the US without a parent or guardian by having federal agents ask teens whether they want to voluntarily depart the country. The directive marked a departure from long-standing protocol which required that federal authorities turn over most unaccompanied children to HHS. Federal authorities previously didn't ask unaccompanied kids from countries other than Mexico and Canada if they wanted to self deport. The efforts to repatriate migrant children who are in immigration proceedings to determine whether they have protections in the US have sparked alarm among immigrant advocates and attorneys. While immigrant advocates maintain that child safety should be a priority, particularly when dealing with vulnerable migrant children, they argue that the Trump administration's policies risk doing more harm than good if they result in kids being sent back to dangerous conditions. The administration has also implemented additional vetting checks and other protocols prior to releasing a child from custody that have prolonged their stays in shelters.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump has asked members of his administration to investigate whether federal funds can be clawed back from Portland, Oregon, in the aftermath of violent antifa protests, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. Conservative influencer Nick Sortor was arrested on charges of second-degree disorderly conduct as violent protests broke out near an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility, drawing outrage from Leavitt and an investigation from the Justice Department. “This incident is part of a troubling trend in Portland, where left-wing mobs believe they get to decide who can visit and live in their city. “I just spoke with the President about this, and he has directed his team here at the White House to begin reviewing aid that can potentially be cut in Portland. We will not fund states that allow anarchy,” she added. Portland Mayor Keith Wilson (D-OR) pushed back against attempts from the Trump administration to bring in federal forces after Friday's press briefing. “The federal government should be focused on partnering with us to expand housing, create jobs, and bolster social services – not siphon vital funding from our economy during a government shutdown that is already hurting cities like ours across the nation,” Wilson added. “It's because the administration is concerned that the Biden administration was handing out taxpayer dollars to pay for this construction based on DEI,” Leavitt explained to reporters. Vought also previously revealed on Wednesday that the government put $18 billion in funding on hold for several large-scale New York infrastructure projects due to similar concerns. He also paused or canceled another $8 billion for “Green New Scam” projects in 16 states, all led by Democrats. Trump and Vought met on Thursday to discuss what agencies could potentially face more layoffs during the shutdown.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Days after being fired, the top national security prosecutor in Virginia's eastern district taped a letter outside his former office accusing top Justice Department officials of being “more concerned” with going after President Donald Trump's perceived enemies than protecting the country's security. The typed letter dated Friday and signed by Michael Ben'Ary said that as a prosecutor, he took an oath “that requires you to follow the facts and the law wherever they lead, free from fear or favor, and unhindered by political interference.” “In recent months, the political leadership of the Department have violated these principles, jeopardizing our national security and making American citizens less safe,” he said. Ben'Ary's letter adds to a list of federal prosecutors who, since Trump took office in January, say they were fired as part of a political calculus and without consideration for their work. But he wasn't involved in the case against former FBI director James Comey case, CNN previously reported, and Ben'Ary denounced his firing as “without cause” and “based on little more than a single social media post containing false information.” “Justice for Americans killed and injured by our enemies should not be contingent on what someone in the Department of Justice sees in their social media feed that day,” he said. CNN has reached out to the Justice Department for comment The Eastern District of Virginia was thrust into turmoil last month when its former leader was forced out over his refusal to indict one Trump's perceived enemies, New York Attorney General Letitia James, with mortgage fraud. The new US Attorney, Trump ally Lindsey Halligan, quickly secured an indictment against Comey for allegedly lying during congressional testimony about the Russia investigation. “The decisions to remove experienced career officials from US Attorneys Offices, the FBI, and other critical parts of DOJ undermines our country's ability to counter terrorist organizations, malign nation-state actors, and countless others that seek to harm our nation and its citizens,” Ben'Ary wrote.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration is reversing cuts to counterterrorism funding for New York after the president intervened, a person familiar with what happened told CNN. “I am pleased to advise that I reversed the cuts made to Homeland Security and Counterterrorism for New York City and State. It was my Honor to do so,” President Donald Trump said in a Truth Social post on Friday. Trump was only informed about the counterterrorism cuts to New York, which have been met with strong pushback from state leaders, in recent days and exploded in anger, ordering them to be reversed, the person said. “While FEMA's initial allocation fully met program requirements, after consultation with federal partners and in recognition of our critical security partnership with New York, FEMA is providing access to $136 million, bringing the State Homeland Security funding to $187 million to ensure it has the resources needed to counter and combat evolving threats,” a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said on Friday. Kathy Hochul celebrated the news on X and credited Trump with the reversal, writing: “From the moment @Sec_Noem tried to defund our police and counterterrorism programs, we stood up and fought back. I'm glad that @POTUS heard our call to reverse these cuts.” “That means $187 million for the NYPD, FDNY & first responders across the state that keep New Yorkers safe,” she said. In a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem earlier this week, Hochul had warned that cutting 86% of homeland security funding from the state “serves only to make not just New York but all of America more vulnerable to terrorist attacks.” A district judge on Wednesday expressed similar concerns, citing 9/11 attacks and other threats, as they blocked the federal government from diverting or withdrawing $34 million in funding to protect New York's transportation system from terrorist attacks, the Associated Press reported. This story has been updated with additional details.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump has set a firm deadline for the terrorist group Hamas to accept the peace deal he crafted with Israel and a coalition of Arab nations. “An Agreement must be reached with Hamas by Sunday Evening at SIX (6) P.M., Washington, D.C. time. If this LAST CHANCE agreement is not reached, all HELL, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas.” The announcement gives Hamas a few extra days to deliberate its next move, as Trump estimated earlier this week that the terrorist group had “three or four” days to decide — a time frame that has already elapsed. Failing to accept the plan could also lose Hamas its last remaining allies, neighboring Arab nations that have grown tired of the terrorist group's unwillingness to establish peace. Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al Thani reportedly told Hamas leaders during a meeting in Doha on Monday that he would be unable to secure a better deal for them than the current offer. “Most of the [remaining Hamas soldiers] are surrounded and MILITARILY TRAPPED, just waiting for me to give the word, ‘GO,' for their lives to be quickly extinguished,” Trump said in his Friday statement. Everyone will be well cared for by those that are waiting to help. Fortunately for Hamas, however, they will be given one last chance!” the president added. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly opposed the plan at first but was strong-armed into support by Trump following the Jewish state's unprecedented cross-border bombings into Qatar last month. The U.S. offered Qatar a defense guarantee against future aggression following Israel's strikes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At least 18 people were arrested outside the Broadview Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility near Chicago Friday, where protesters have gathered several weeks in a row amid bubbling tensions as the Trump administration's larger immigration enforcement efforts continue. Friday's protests mirror demonstrations seen at the ICE facility in recent weeks. Broadview police officers and Cook County sheriff's deputies held the line near a large group of protesters and were instructed at one point to put on gas masks. At least five people have been arrested for aggravated battery to a police officer and resisting and obstruction, the Cook County Sheriff's Office told CNN. “We're not just going to be rolling out of Chicago here, but we're sending in the Department of War at the request that I made to Secretary Hegseth. They're going to be rolling in here within the next 24 hours. There are no written orders for the National Guard to be deployed to Chicago, and there is no unit preparing for that mission, a US Northern Command spokesperson told CNN. This is a public building,” Noem said in the post. “This is how JB Pritzker and his cronies treat our law enforcement,” she said in the post. Village of Broadview spokesperson David Ormsby told CNN in a statement, “We are distressed to hear that the bathrooms are unavailable at the ICE facility.” Noem visited Broadview's Village Hall unannounced to ask for a meeting with Mayor Katrina Thompson, who was out at the time, the spokesperson said. The facility, about 10 miles west of Chicago, has been the site of demonstrations against ramped-up ICE enforcement and aggressive tactics for several weeks. Similar protests have flared across the country, including this week in Portland, Oregon, as the White House has aimed to crack down on crime more broadly in Democratic-led cities, often citing the need to protect ICE sites. “Our house is on fire, and our firefighters are using their hoses to water the lawn outside,” Pritzker said while speaking at a fundraiser held by Georgia Democrats. The protests near Chicago began after local leaders got word in early September that “a large-scale enforcement campaign” would soon be underway in the Windy City as part of the Trump administration's sweeping immigration agenda. The Midway Blitz Operation has resulted in more than 1,000 arrests, the Department of Homeland Security said in a news release Friday. “Federal agents reporting to Secretary Noem have spent weeks snatching up families, scaring law-abiding residents, violating due process rights, and even detaining U.S. citizens,” Illinois Gov. Federal agents are also “acting with impunity,” the governor said in a statement provided to CNN. “In addition to their inhumane tactics on immigration enforcement, they have grossly mishandled and incited tensions at the Broadview facility. Local, state and federal agencies have a large presence at the facility, and have closed multiple streets, including 25th Avenue, a major street in Broadview. 4 Illinois ICE facility protesters face federal charges; 1 threatened to kill an agent, complaint says Protesters outside the facility Friday morning held signs and chanted. One sign read, “ICE melts under resistance,” meanwhile another said, “Hate has no home here.” Protester Nicole Bandyk lives in a nearby suburb and decided to join the demonstrators after watching coverage of the protests in news reports and online. We are becoming a fascist authoritarian state and it's wrong.” The latest round of arrests come two weeks after a Democratic Chicago-area mayor running for Congress in Illinois said federal agents teargassed him outside the same facility. Daniel Biss, the mayor of Evanston, Illinois, spoke about the incident in a video on his X account, saying: “Not only did they come with weapons and violence, show of force and drive a van into us, but then they teargassed us, and I have to tell you, it was terrifying.” Chicago-area mayor says federal agents teargassed him at a protest outside an ICE facility Sidney Wright IV, Kara Devlin and Elizabeth Wolfe contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? In Life of a Showgirl, she's done with that. She urges the song's second narrator — a wide-eyed dreamer “as sweet as a peach,” also voiced by Swift — not to strive after the spotlight. The peach-sweet dreamer decides she's going to aim for fame nonetheless. She takes the first showgirl's warning to heart, finding that by the peak of her career, all the up and comers are “bitches” who wish she would “hurry up and die.” Regardless, the dreamer-turned-icon has no plans to do so: “I'm immortal, baby dolls,” she croons. “I couldn't if I tried.” For that reason, she's “married to the hustle,” and despite the “pain hidden by lipstick and lace,” she “wouldn't have it any other way.” So it's not unusual for Swift to sing about the dark side of fame. But it is unusual, both for pop stars in general and Swift in particular, to finish up such a song by announcing that nonetheless, she wants to be famous and she is happy that she is. The idea that Swift has pursued fame with a single-minded fixation since the beginning of her career cannot be news to anyone who has ever given one of her songs a more than cursory listen. From her self-titled release in 2006 forward, Swift's public persona has seemed to vibrate from a desire to win: Grammys, billboard battles, feuds, prestige, money, history, everything. That pure intensity of ambition has always been one of the most compelling aspects of Swift's star image, all the more so because it is so in tension with her sweet everygirl relatability. In a culture that discourages feminine agency, nice girls are not supposed to be ambitious, and Taylor Swift is nothing if not a nice girl. Yet all the same, Swift wants with such an unfeminine lack of restraint (complimentary). At times, Swift's ambition has read as a liability. When she got photographed by the paparazzi — and she was papped a lot — people said the pictures looked posed. When Kim Kardashian leaked snippets of a conversation between Swift and Kanye West that made it appear Swift was lying to the public in a cynical ploy for sympathy, people said she was a conniving snake. (Swift would later be vindicated when the full tape leaked.) The harder she insisted on being a dreamer, the more it felt like a lie, because anyone could see how hard she was working and how much she wanted to be huge. How disorienting if she was both, after all. We live in a moment that rewards celebrities who show their work over celebrities who make it look easy (see Beyoncé), and Swift didn't shy away from showing the sheer physical strain of performing her three-hour Eras tour set night after night after night. She's also played with making her ambition less threatening by putting it in a romantic context. In “Mastermind” from 2022's Midnights, she sings about a woman who ruthlessly strategizes her romantic conquests, only to be rewarded with a boyfriend who knows she's plotting her way to him and likes that about her. “I'm not trying to exaggerate, but I think I might die if it happened, die if it happened to me,” she sings in character as a young striver in “Clara Bow” from 2024's Tortured Poet Department. The song ends with Swift herself rendered as obsolete as original It Girl Clara Bow, left only as a reference for some new up-and-comer who looks “like Taylor Swift” but has “edge she never did.” Sure, fame is rough and people say mean things about her sometimes, but still — “I wouldn't have it any other way.” It's a remarkably self-assured statement from someone who has spent so much of her career furiously working to portray a non-threatening girl next door. It suggests a Taylor Swift who is done apologizing for being ambitious, who sees no profit in trying to cover it up any longer. She is, like the narrator of “Mastermind,” telling us that none of this was accidental, that nothing was gonna stop her, and that furthermore she isn't tortured by her fame; she's happy about it. She is “not a bad bitch,” as she sings on “Eldest Daughter.” She's a responsible oldest child, clearly announcing her intentions to marry her boyfriend and have a bunch of kids. She just also loves being famous and has no intention of giving it up. What's new here is seeing her acknowledge it without any apology, and being forced to confront our own knowledge of Swift's ambition at the same time. We're living in a moment of deep anti-feminist backlash, one where it's becoming an increasingly common talking point from conservatives to say that a woman's highest purpose is to have children. The policies of Trump's administration have been both effectively and ineffectively targeted at pushing women out of the workforce. Charlie Kirk spent the week before he died telling a newly engaged Swift that she should submit to her husband, take his last name, and have a passel of babies. “Maybe one of the reasons why Taylor Swift has been so annoyingly liberal over the last couple of years is that she's not yet married and she doesn't have children,” Kirk mused. “That's not a great role model for young women, to wait all the way until you're 35 and just put your career first.” Nice girls, after all, are not ambitious: They put family before work. Yet here is Swift, just weeks after announcing her engagement, singing about being happy that she knows the life of a showgirl. Right now, despite everything else, the biggest star in the world is a woman who is willing to crow over her own professional and artistic ambition. The age of AI slop is upon us. ﻿Why are so many young men turning toward fatherhood? Zoomers might fear cringe, but the internet embraces personal humiliation. In Trump's manosphere, the center is not holding.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Sixteen rectangular, clear plastic bins lined the room's back and side walls, tiny stages for unlikely romances. Each bin contained a plastic green pond plant — the kind you would buy for fish to make Nemo feel at home — about an inch of water, and two endangered Houston toads, a drab-looking critter with a pale belly, dark spots, and raised patches of skin that, in a betrayal of the stereotypes, aren't warts. The females, hanging out in their respective bins, had already been injected with their doses since it takes them longer to both lay eggs and acquiesce to the next step. Soon, each female shuffled around her tub, laying a string of thousands of tiny eggs strung together like black pearls. And I like to think…might have even helped a little with the ambiance. You probably haven't thought much about amphibian-assisted reproduction lately (or, let's be honest, ever). But in a lab tucked inside the Fort Worth Zoo, scientists are playing matchmaker for one of the rarest toads in the country — performing ultrasounds, injecting hormones, counting eggs by the tens of thousands, and trying to keep a species alive with spreadsheets and syringes. The Houston toad, once common across southeast Texas, is now so endangered that its best shot at survival involves assisted reproduction, willing landowners, and some very determined humans who want to help them survive again in the wild. After that initial discovery, herpetologists made sporadic observations of hundreds of toads at individual ponds, on coastal plains, and in forests across 13 Texas counties, but their sightings were still relatively few and far between. “The challenge is [the Houston toad has] always been kind of rare,” said Paul Crump, the state herpetologist for Texas Parks and Wildlife, who has worked for nearly two decades on Houston toad recovery. “And we've only got these little glimpses into what it's doing.” By the mid-century, people in the state had introduced non-native species like fire ants that bit and killed juvenile toads, feral hogs that ate them and reduced wetland water quality, and grasses that made it difficult for toads to navigate. But the listing may have been too late. But uncharismatic species like the Houston toad still matter. “They're like rivets on an airplane,” said Crump. “All these pieces exist in a system, and there's probably some redundancy, but you can only lose so many amphibian species, just like you can only lose so many rivets on an airplane, before things fall apart.” And the planet is losing a lot of rivets. Amphibians are among the most endangered classes of animals on Earth. Protecting a species like the Houston toad also means restoring and maintaining habitat. That helps not only countless other native species like quail and deer but also protects aquifers that supply our drinking water. And while efforts like assisted reproduction may sound herculean (they often are), Diane Barber, the Fort Worth Zoo's senior curator of ectotherms (animals that rely on external sources for temperature regulation), said they're relatively inexpensive in the world of keeping species alive. At the Fort Worth Zoo, technicians individually counted and marked the latest batch of fertilized Houston toad eggs, adding them to the 3 million embryos they and three other breeding facilities planned to catalog. Eventually, they hope to introduce them into the few ponds where researchers know small numbers of Houston toads still exist in the wild. The species may be critically endangered, but following Marvin Gaye's advice was never their issue. They're good at reproducing, said Barber, if they can just live long enough to find each other — a sometimes impossible hurdle for a critically endangered species. So in 2007, researchers scooped up portions of three Houston toad egg strands and brought them into captivity, and began the years-long process of figuring out how to breed and raise endangered toads. A few years later, Barber brought toadlets to the Fort Worth Zoo and turned breeding from a series of tossing toads together, crossing fingers, and hoping for the best, to an exercise in spreadsheets, hormone injections, and tediously kept calendars. Each Wednesday after breeding, she sits in her office surrounded by drawings and sketches of Houston toads and Puerto Rican crested toads (another amphibian on the brink) and parses the complex data on her monitors, deciding which individuals are best suited for the next week's matchmaking session. Then she uses a convoluted algorithm to pair together female and male toads best suited by size (if the male is too small, he can't hold onto the female, and if he's too big, he might drown her), and, most importantly, by their distance from one another on the Houston toad family tree. She is not selecting for individual traits so much as preventing toad incest. “We don't want to breed nieces, nephews, cousins, siblings, brothers, or sisters,” she said. If a male contains important genetics — as in, is not closely related to many of the females — but is too small to mate with them, Julien collects his microscopic sperm and either freezes it in a cryopreservation bank or artificially fertilizes a good match's eggs. “If the Houston Zoo, for example, has had an important male die, they will ship us the male's testes and [Julien] will mash them up and preserve the sperm,” said Barber. Once this intricate process is complete, Barber and her team load the eggs into plastic bags and place them in buckets along with dozens of juvenile toads not needed for breeding for a long drive south to one of the only places in the wild where Houston toads can currently survive. Today, more than 10 million people live across San Antonio, the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area, and Houston. But just past the billboards, six-lane highways, and sprawling development, biologists believe there's an existing ecosystem where the Houston toad could soon thrive again. This spring, Barber, with her buckets filled with toad eggs in tow, pulled up to the gated entrance of a large property owned by Scouting America Capitol Area Council, an arm of what was formerly known as the Boy Scouts of America. It's a sprawling piece of undeveloped Texas, with stretches of oak and loblolly pine forests and peppered with scenic ponds — perfect for ropes courses, hiking, and lessons on living in the wild. Mike Forstner, a Texas State University biologist who has studied the Houston toad for decades, Jon Yates, the CEO of the Capitol Area Council, and a handful of other biologists from TSU and the Fish and Wildlife Service waited for Barber and her precious cargo. Those strings of tiny pearls suspended in plastic bags would soon join any wild egg masses in one of two small ponds on the Scouts' property, the Griffith League Scout Ranch. And so they decided they could make a more nature-based adventure park for their Scouts while also conserving an endangered species. “There was a lot of consternation (at first),” said Yates about the decision to keep the land intact for conservation. But eventually the Scouts found a good balance: They cut hiking trails, curated education opportunities, and even built a ropes course. Essentially, Scouting America could “still have Scouts on it but do the right thing for conservation,” Yates said. But even here — in this figurative walled garden as well as a nearby state park — the last remaining wild Houston toads have struggled. Persistent drought in the area has dried many of the ephemeral ponds where Houston toads live, and then a wildfire incinerated much of the remaining occupied Houston toad habitat, including almost an entire neighboring state park. By 2016, Houston toads were closer to extinction than they'd ever been. The Scouts' ranch is a good start, but restoring Houston toads in the wild requires more than one population on one piece of land. If landowners agree to manage their property to the benefit of Houston toads and countless other species, the state of Texas will give them a better deal on their property taxes. Decades before he bought his property northwest of Houston a handful of years ago, the land had been used as a ranch. But when the former owner stopped grazing cattle, yaupon took over. With a grant from the Fish and Wildlife Service, Bermúdez mechanically cut down 50 acres of yaupon and created large swaths of open space. His wife takes bird walks through his property and every week records more species, already noticing a difference in habitat. He's a long way from welcoming Houston toads to his property — he just started his restoration work — but that's the ultimate goal. “The Houston toad is like a lot of these iconic species,” he said. “It's a way of preserving the land for other things.” Dozens of landowners like Bermúdez participate in the program. In part because long-term, managing and conserving the habitat may actually save him money. Thirty years ago, Texas voters made a consequential decision. The state already evaluated the value of agricultural land differently than a house in a city, understanding that 40,000-, 70,000- or 100,000-acre ranches used for grazing cattle weren't worth the same as even a city block in, say, downtown Austin. The effect was, essentially, a tax break for anyone raising livestock. But then deer hunters, environmentalists, and landowners had an idea: What if those same benefits could go to people who produced not cows and sheep, but native wildlife like deer, quail, or songbirds? Now landowners get the same change in valuation by participating in some meaningful conservation practices like setting out bird boxes or feeders, shooting feral hogs, poisoning fire ant mounds, or cutting and burning overgrowth. And ultimately, it means someone like Bermúdez is a lot more likely to help out a beleaguered little species like the Houston toad. This kind of capitalistic mutual benefit may just be one of the best approaches to solving our country's endangered species conundrums, and in a state like Texas, where more than 93 percent of the land is private, a lot is possible — at least when reasonable landowners are part of the equation. Not far from the Scouts' property, land owners Roxanne and Elvis Hernandez aren't in it for tax benefits — they're in it for the toads. But even with their altruistic motivation, keeping up the work is about to get a lot harder. “Habitat work is not inexpensive,” Roxanne Hernandez said. “And any cutback in funding is just a setback for the conservation effort.” And so I wanted to witness the work still underway. On a muggy spring night after we transplanted all those eggs, I went out with Crump to survey wooded areas where Houston toads once called but hadn't been heard from in well over a decade. Was it possible they still existed somewhere else in the wild? Had they reproduced somewhere else, tucked away, hidden from all those threats? We'd been creeping along rural county dirt roads in an old Chevy Silverado. We stopped every so often to hop out and listen again. But despite our abysmal night, he wasn't ready to call it. “It's either optimism or quitting,” he said about Houston toad recovery efforts. Crump and Truelock might have felt optimistic, but I sure didn't. Because if a toad that's almost gone can still call for a future, the least we can do is try to answer.
