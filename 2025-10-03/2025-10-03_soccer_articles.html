                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Italian football club Juventus banned three fans from a rival club on Friday for shouting racist comments at United States national team star Weston McKennie. Club officials said they used a “state-of-the-art surveillance system” to help law enforcement identify the three visiting supporters. FIFA said they will use their "three-step anti-discrimination procedure" to tackle racism and discrimination if encountered at any sanctioned event, including the World Cup. Italy's Juventus Football Club banned three fans from rival club Parma on Friday for shouting racist comments at United States national team star Weston McKennie after a league match between the teams in August. McKennie, a Texas native who is Black, has played for Juventus in the Italian Serie A League since 2020 and has heard racist comments from fans several times during his professional career overseas. Club officials said they used a “state-of-the-art surveillance system,” including multifocal cameras, to help law enforcement identify the three visiting supporters. Authorities say they heckled McKinnie as he cooled down after the match with his teammates. Download the SAN app today to stay up-to-date with Unbiased. After the first few opening matches of the Club World Cup, a lack of anti-racism and discrimination signage led to criticism from fans. FIFA responded by playing a message on video boards before subsequent games in which several players repeated the same mantra. Make your voice heard for football without racism. Soccer's world-wide governing body fined six nations on Sept. 3, including defending World Cup champion Argentina, for racist abuse by fans at World Cup qualifiers in June. The six countries officials said engaged in “discrimination and racist abuse” were Albania, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, according to the FIFA disciplinary committee. It did not provide details on the cases. FIFA President Gianni Infantino urged politicians and law enforcement professionals around the world to join his organization in the fight against racism and discrimination. He delivered a pre-recorded video message to the Red Card to Racism in Football event in May, saying criminal penalties should be imposed on offenders. “FIFA's Global Stand Against Racism called for the football world to take action,” Infantino said. FIFA said it will use its “three-step anti-discrimination procedure” to tackle racism and discrimination if encountered at a match, whether in the stands or on the pitch. That procedure involves players, staff and even fans using the “No Racism” gesture seen in the player's video to alert officials to a violation. The next step would be a formal disciplinary process for any team personnel or fans involved — for instance, banning them from future competitions. The third step is sharing evidence for national-level prosecutions if local statutes apply. The club has previously dealt with similar incidents by visiting supporters following games in 2023 and 2024.

Repeated racist abuse towards players demonstrates persistent discrimination in professional soccer, spurring calls for stronger action and penalties from clubs and governing bodies. The use of advanced surveillance technology by clubs helps identify and ban perpetrators, representing evolving methods to combat discriminatory behavior at sporting events.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>‘Seven or eight' players to miss Liverpool match Enzo Maresca believes Chelsea are paying the price for their Club World Cup exertions, with the manager without “seven or eight” players for Saturday's visit of Liverpool. Cole Palmer is out with a recurring groin problem, joining the long-term absentees Wesley Fofana, Liam Delap, Levi Colwill, Andrey Santos and Tosin Adarabioyo on the sidelines, and Trevoh Chalobah is suspended after his sending-off in last weekend's home defeat by Brighton. A report published by the global players' union Fifpro this week said Chelsea's players were given 20 days off after winning the Club World Cup in July, and that the beaten finalists, Paris Saint-Germain, rested players for 22 days, a high workload it linked to both clubs' injury problems. Maresca said he agreed with the tenor of the Fifpro report before expressing faith in the young players he will call up to stand in, with the 19-year-old Josh Acheampong expected to replace Chalobah at centre-back for his fourth Premier League start. “If PSG and Chelsea have so many injuries, probably it's some consequences from the Club World Cup. In this moment we have four or five defenders out, but we're going to try to adapt and find the right solution. For sure, when you can change one player after four or five games, it's better. When you continue to change it's more difficult. Maresca was on less sure ground when claiming to be unconcerned by Chelsea's disciplinary record, with João Pedro's sending-off in their Champions League win over Benfica this week their third red card in as many matches after Chalobah's dismissal and Robert Sánchez's in the defeat at Manchester United. Since Maresca joined in June 2024, Chelsea's disciplinary record across all competitions is the worst of the Premier League clubs, with seven red cards in 73 games, one every 10.4 matches. Chelsea also top the table for Premier League yellow cards under his reign, with 114, and the Italian has the second-highest card-per-game rate at one club in the Premier League at 2.7, a figure beaten by Mauricio Pochettino during his time at Stamford Bridge (2.9). “I don't see any discipline problem,” Maresca said. In that case, it's just a decision that you have to take in two seconds, three seconds.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manchester United and Chelsea both continued their unbeaten starts to the Women's Super League season as a stunning Anna Sandberg strike earned the Red Devils a well-deserved 1-1 draw against the champions, who dropped points for the first time this season. Wieke Kaptein scored an early opener for the Blues and both sides could have gone on to clinch victory in an entertaining encounter between the two early pace-setters. Marc Skinner's Red Devils could have gone to the summit of the table with victory, and played like a team with a point to prove. United striker Elisabeth Terland forced the game's first save early on, before Ella Toone freed Jess Park on the break but she could only clip the ball over. It was a moment of undoubted quality. The home side would soon be level, though, and what a goal it was. It was a goal which even the champions could do nothing about. If any side would win, it looked like the Red Devils - until a couple of nervy moments late on, where Keira Walsh forced a smart save while Dominique Jansen caused a nervy moment for her goalkeeper. One final cross by Blues substitute Alyssa Thompson sailed agonisingly out of play and the referee blew the final whistle after an enthralling encounter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Slated to take place in the USA, Mexico and Canada, the United States will be aiming to make a deep push in the World Cup being contested on their own turf, having appointed former Tottenham Hotspur, PSG and Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino in 2024. American president Donald Trump has also stated that any potential decision to ban Israel from the World Cup would be blocked by the country, which has further fueled discussions about the tournament. The draw for the upcoming edition of football's most prestigious competition is slated to take place in the American capital of Washington D.C., on 5 December, where group stage fixtures will be determined. "The list includes federation president Mehdi Taj, national-team coach Amir Ghalenoei, and seven other officials, according to federation spokesman Amir-Mehdi Alavi." Concerns over the relations between the two countries have been questioned throughout the year, following changes to American visa requirements for Iranians being imposed during Trump's presidency. This, in turn, fueled speculation that participation in the World Cup for Iran's national team "would be jeopardised." Iran were one of 12 countries that were revealed to be banned from entering America and the denial of entry to the FFI delegation suggests that the US are unmoved from their earlier stance. Whether a resolution for this situation is ultimately found before the draw takes place in December remains to be seen. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA vice president Victor Montagliani struck down U.S. President Donald Trump's recent threats to move certain host cities for the 2026 World Cup, asserting that only FIFA can “make those decisions.” Eleven cities in the U.S., including Seattle and San Francisco, will host matches, which were scrutinized by President Trump last week. “It will be safe for the World Cup. If I think it isn't safe [for the World Cup], we'll move it to a different city. Absolutely… If I think it's not safe, we're going to move it out of that city,” the U.S. president said. Now, Montagliani made his and FIFA's stance clear on the subject, going directly against the remarks of President Trump. Sign Up to Get Informed With SI FC (US Only). “That's the beauty of our game, is that it is bigger than any individual and bigger than any country,” Montagliani finished. Severe logistical, legal and financial issues could arise with the change of any host city with the tournament just nine months away. FIFA president Gianni Infantino has not yet weighed in on the subject. The U.S. men's national team kicks off their 2026 World Cup campaign in Los Angeles at SoFi Stadium before heading to Seattle to play their second group stage match at Lumen Field. The city has been one of several in the U.S. to push back against President Trump's immigration and crime policies. It remains unclear how matches could, or potentially would, be moved to other cities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For the second time this season, a legend of the game is getting her flowers. Now, Christine Sinclair gets the royal treatment in Portland with a Thorns Hall of Fame induction and jersey retirement. As one of the OG NWSL players, who helped define what the league would look like, Sinclair crystalized her legacy over 12 seasons – all with Portland. In all competitions, she scored 79 goals and had 19 assists. It's hard to pick from a monumental career like that, but in honor of the Sinc celebration this weekend, we're looking back at 12 of Portland's forever No. Her stoppage time goal in the 2013 NWSL Championship not only secured Portland's first title, but it also marked the beginning of a new era of women's soccer. The Thorns became the very first NWSL Champions, something they'd repeat two more times – in 2017 and again in 2022 – before Sinclair retired. Two minutes into stoppage time, Morgan teed up a pass through the Flash defense and Sinclair drove it home to the lower left corner. After scoring two goals in the first half against the Boston Breakers on July 20, 2014, it was again Morgan who set Sinclair up to finish the job. The third goal of Sinclair's hat trick came just moments into the second half after Morgan danced around in front of Alyssa Naeher but couldn't get a shot off. Morgan passes to Sinclair, and with a single touch, she puts Portland up 4-3. The best kind of chips are as follows: ice, potato, and Sinc. After falling to the Flash 2-0 in October 2016, Sinclair took it upon herself to try and mount a comeback. Though the Thorns ultimately lost 4-3, she opened up scoring for Portland with a long, high ball. With a single touch she volleyed it home. As much as Sinclair got by with help from her teammates, sometimes she got creative and assisted herself – like this 2017 game against the Spirit. With a tap of her left foot, Sinclair gets the goal. This equalizing goal when Portland played Chicago in 2018 is simply electric. Sinclair makes it look easy with another single touch goal against the Pride in 2019. With pressure on Gotham, she forced a turnover and took it home herself with a clean shot from just outside the box. In a 2022 match against Angel City, the Thorns took an early 1-0 lead, but when Hina Sugita forced a turnover just minutes later, Sinclair didn't miss her chance to double the lead. There is nothing like a rivalry, and there is nothing like the Cascadia Rivalry. As the minutes wound down in this June 2023 match, the Thorns were up 1-0, but in these intense games, you can't be too safe. Morgan Weaver took the ball down to the line and crossed it into Seattle's box, where Sinclair drove it home with a single touch. Less than 10 minutes into the second half, Sinclair doubled Portland's lead with a shot from just outside the 18. If the past is any indication, fans can expect the home crowd to be out in full force to celebrate No. You can watch the Thorns host Bay FC on Saturday, October 4 at 10 p.m.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>

The U.S. State Department has reportedly declined visa requests for an official Iranian delegation to attend the draw for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which is scheduled to be held at the Kennedy Center in D.C. on Dec. 5. The Tehran Times, an English-language Iranian news outlet, reported Wednesday that the U.S. government has not issued visas for Iran Football Federation President Mehdi Taj, coach Amir Ghalenoei and seven other federation members seeking to attend the draw.

The report of a potential effort by the federal government to prevent the Iranian officials from attending the draw has naturally raised questions about whether the Iranian team, which has already qualified for the World Cup, will be able to participate in the competition itself next summer. President Trump issued an executive order earlier this year banning travel to the U.S. from 12 countries, including Iran, but included a carve-out for “major sporting events,” with specific references to the World Cup and Olympics. 

FIFA VP and Concacaf President Victor Montagliani said Wednesday at Leaders Week London that he was not concerned about the Iranian national team being able to play matches in the U.S. during next summer's World Cup despite the host country's restrictions on travel from Iran. He said that where Iran plays its matches will be determined by December's draw rather than any geopolitical considerations. “We already have assurances from all three governments [the U.S., Canada and Mexico] ... that teams that qualify will be allowed to come in and participate,” Montagliani said.

A State Dept. spokesperson declined comment to SBJ, citing visa record confidentiality.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Italy are due to play Israel in a FIFA World Cup qualifier in Udine but there have been calls for a boycott. Pro-Palestinian protesters approached the gates of the Italy football team's training centre on Friday to demand the cancellation of its upcoming World Cup qualifier against Israel due to the war on Gaza. The protest was part of a national strike that was reacting to Israeli forces' interdiction of an aid flotilla. Italy is scheduled to host Israel in Udine on October 14. But UEFA is considering suspending Israel over the war. Protesters appeared to behave peacefully on the opposite side of the street from the football complex, holding aloft a banner that read in Italian, “Let's stop Zionism with the resistance.” A protest leader grabbed a microphone and shouted, “How can you still allow Israel, a Zionist and criminal state, to play football games?” Dozens of protests have erupted across Italy since Wednesday night, after the Israeli navy intercepted the Global Sumud Flotilla, detaining its activists. On Friday, workers and students took to the streets after the country's largest unions called for a one-day general strike in solidarity with the Palestinians and the flotilla. Hundreds of trains were cancelled or delayed, as were several domestic flights, and many private and public schools closed. The Italian Football Coaches' Association (AIAC) pushed in August for Israel to be suspended from international competition for its war on Gaza.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thomas Tuchel says it would be “better if we play later” as the England boss welcomed the idea of next summer's World Cup kick-off times being moved back to deal with the intense heat. The back-to-back European Championship runners-up are among the favourites to win a tournament they could qualify for this month if they beat Latvia and other results in Group K go their way. The United States, Canada and Mexico are co-hosting a tournament that will be played amid challenging conditions, which Tuchel witnessed firsthand during his time at the Club World Cup. FIFA vice-president Victor Montagliani this week said the impact of kick-off times had been a major lesson for the organisers, meaning fixtures could be put back to combat the heat next year. “I know the fans will not like it but for us it's better if we play later, of course,” England boss Tuchel said. “For everyone it's better to play later.” Tuchel said “if you do a run at 2pm in Charlotte then you know” when asked why it would be better to move World Cup kick-off times. “Midnight here, I understand that it's bad for our fans,” Tuchel said. “There will be a lot of drop outs the next day at school, I guess!” Would we use it as an excuse? (Earlier) it becomes slower, and less quality.” Tuchel last month said he was ready to mix it up at the World Cup, saying the “long throw-in is back” as he also spoke about the need to utilise long balls. The weeks since England's last camp has underlined that change in tack, from Liverpool's set pieces struggles to Pep Guardiola getting Manchester City defending deep at Arsenal. Long goal kicks are back, it's not only about playing short. “I think it's just everyone tries to find the slightest advantage, and once you suffer against a team who's doing it, you go ‘why are we not doing this?' These things are back, and also we will try to find our advantages of course.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>England head coach Thomas Tuchel has admitted that he would prefer later kick-off times at next summer's World Cup to “protect the game” even if it makes the matches harder to watch on television in Europe. Speaking at his squad announcement press conference at Wembley on Friday, Tuchel said that he would rather not play in that heat and humidity in the middle of the day. Those games were easy to follow on TV in Europe (EDT is five hours behind British Summer Time) but difficult for the players. Tuchel said that his experiences at the tournament meant he did not want his England team to go through that next year. “If you do a run at 2pm in Charlotte then you know,” said Tuchel, when asked why exactly he wanted later kick-off times. “It's clear, for me, we have to put the players first. This would be better for the players but harder for those watching at home in Europe, with games being broadcast at midnight or 1am in the UK. “I understand that it's bad for our fans,” Tuchel said, when asked about the possibility of midnight BST kick-offs next summer. There will be a lot of drop-outs the next day at school, I guess!“ “I'm not sure if the coaches have a big word on that,” he said. “I think everyone is very clear about it.” Jack Pitt-Brooke  is a football journalist for The Athletic based in London.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Thursday, October 2, FIFA and adidas unveiled the “Trionda” match ball for the tournament on FIFA's website and social media channels with a little help from mascots Maple, Zayu and Clutch. The Trionda — a name derived from Spanish for “three waves” — ball is composed of just four white panels, which are adorned with swirling red, green, and blue designs to represent each of the three North American host countries. I am happy and proud to present TRIONDA. adidas have created another iconic FIFA World Cup ball, with the design embodying the unity and passion of next year's host nations Canada, Mexico, and the United States. “The four-panel construction incorporates intentionally deep seams, creating a surface that produces optimal in-flight stability by ensuring sufficient and evenly distributed drag as the ball travels through the air,” FIFA says. “Additionally, embossed icons that are only visible up close elevate grip when striking or dribbling the ball in wet or humid conditions.” The panels are thermal bonded, giving the ball a more predictable trajectory, better touch and lower water uptake. Two versions of the Trionda are currently available for purchase on FIFA's official online store: the pro version ($170 USD) and the competition version ($60 USD). Trionda is the 15th official World Cup match ball that adidas has manufactured, dating back to the 1970 tournament in Mexico. The 2026 FIFA World Cup kicks off on June 11, 2026, at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City. The final is slated for July 19 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Other matches will be held in Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, Vancouver, Dallas, Guadalajara, Houston, Kansas City, Monterrey, Atlanta, Boston, Miami, Philadelphia, and Toronto. This will be the first World Cup contested under a new 48-team format. So far, 18 teams have qualified for the tournament, including the three host nations, who will all play their group stage matches on home soil.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pep Guardiola has cautioned Manchester City supporters that star midfielder Rodri (29) may not return to his peak levels until next summer's World Cup. The Spain international, who was sidelined for the majority of last season with an ACL injury, has made just eight appearances for club and country this term as he continues his gradual return to full fitness. Rodri featured for 61 minutes in City's Champions League draw with Monaco on Wednesday, but Guardiola insists the 29-year-old must be given time to rediscover his rhythm. Speaking to Sky Sports, the City boss explained: “Rodri, I said to him, he maybe struggled to understand it, it's not about six months, seven months, eight months. ‘Oh, I'll play and be the Rodri I was before.' In the World Cup will be the best Rodri, and the next season will be the best Rodri. This season will be how you handle it, step by step.” Guardiola added that the physical toll of a year on the treatment table cannot be underestimated, emphasising that rhythm and sharpness only return through consistent match play. For City, the challenge will be balancing patience with their reliance on Rodri's influence at the heart of midfield. City next face Brentford away from home on Sunday.</p>

Raines continued his run forward and latched onto the end of a pass in the box before tucking a low, right-footed effort past France ‘keeper Lisandru Olmeta in the 88th minute. The USA wasn't satisfied with two and bagged one more in the second minute of second-half stoppage time. Substitute Matthew Corcoran played a looping ball over the top for Miller who chested down on the right before playing a centering pass for Gozo. U.S. head coach Marko Mitrović made two changes from the Starting XI that faced New Caledonia on Monday, inserting Taha Habroune and Peyton Miller.
