                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Treasury Department is considering minting a $1 coin bearing President Donald Trump's likeness on both sides to honor him and commemorate the United States' 250th birthday next year. A first draft of that coin, which will mark the semiquincentennial anniversary of the nation's founding, depicts Trump's head in profile on one side, above the words "IN GOD WE TRUST" and the dates 1776 and 2026. The other side of the coin shows a defiant-looking Trump raising his fist, closely matching the pose he struck moments after surviving an assassination attempt at a 2024 presidential campaign rally in Pennsylvania. The words "FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT," which Trump mouthed to his supporters right after that attack, appear around the edge of that side of the coin. These first drafts honoring America's 250th Birthday and @POTUS are real," U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach wrote on X in response to a post touting sketches of the coin. "Looking forward to sharing more soon, once the obstructionist shutdown of the United States government is over," Beach wrote. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reposted Beach's message from his own X account. But "this first draft reflects well the enduring spirit of our country and democracy, even in the face of immense obstacles," the spokesperson said, adding, "We look forward to sharing more soon." Commemorative coins are legal tender, but they are not minted for general circulation, according to the United States Mint. It was not immediately clear if the government has created any previous commemorative coins or other coins depicting a living president. A federal law signed by Trump in January 2021 — just a week before his first term in office ended — allows the Treasury secretary to mint $1 coins "with designs emblematic of the United States semiquincentennial" during the year of the anniversary. But that same law, under a heading on standards for circulating collectible coins, states, "No head and shoulders portrait or bust of any person, living or dead, and no portrait of a living person may be included in the design on the reverse of any coin under subsections (x), (y), and (z)." That language appears in similar forms in other coin-related laws listed on the U.S. Mint's website. The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco notes, "To avoid the appearance of a monarchy, it was long-standing tradition to only feature portraits of deceased individuals on currency and coin." "That tradition became law with an 1866 Act of Congress," the Fed bank added. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Supreme Court again cleared the way on Friday for Donald Trump's administration to revoke a temporary legal protection for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants in the United States, backing a key priority of the Republican president as he pursues a policy of mass deportations. The justices granted the administration's request to put on hold a judge's ruling that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem lacked the authority to end the Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, granted to the migrants under Trump's Democratic predecessor Joe Biden while litigation proceeds. Chen issued a final ruling on September 5, finding that Noem's actions to terminate the program violated a federal law that governs the actions of federal agencies. The judge also faulted Noem's "discriminatory statements" concerning the Venezuelans, noting that her generalization of the alleged crimes of a few migrants "to the entire population of Venezuelan TPS holders who have lower rates of criminality and higher rates of college education and workforce participation than the general population is a classic form of racism." Chen's ruling meant that more than 300,000 Venezuelan TPS holders would be able to remain in the country for now, even though Noem had determined that to be "contrary to the national interest," according to the administration. Trump has made cracking down on immigration - legal and illegal - a central plank of his second term as president, and has moved to strip certain migrants of temporary legal protections, expanding the pool of possible deportees. The TPS program is a humanitarian designation under U.S. law for countries stricken by war, natural disaster or other catastrophes, giving recipients living in the United States deportation protection and access to work permits. The U.S. government under Biden designated Venezuelans as eligible for TPS in 2021 and 2023. Just days before Trump returned to office in January, Biden's administration announced an extension of the program to October 2026. Noem, a Trump appointee, rescinded that extension and moved to end the TPS designation for a subset of Venezuelans who had benefited from the 2023 designation. Some lower courts have expressed confusion and frustration in recent weeks as they attempt to follow Supreme Court emergency orders that often are issued with little or no legal reasoning presented. "This court's orders are binding on litigants and lower courts. Whether those orders span one sentence or many pages, disregarding them - as the lower courts did here - is unacceptable," the Justice Department said. In another case, the Supreme Court on May 30 let the administration revoke a different type of temporary legal status for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan, Cuban, Haitian and Nicaraguan migrants. The justices put on hold another judge's order that had halted the administration's move to end the immigration "parole" granted under Biden to 532,000 of these migrants while a legal challenge played out. Immigration parole is a form of temporary permission under U.S. law to be in the country for "urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit," allowing recipients to live and work in the United States.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon is closing four more Fresh supermarkets in Southern California as the e-commerce giant continues to focus its grocery strategy around Whole Foods and delivery. They follow the shuttering of four other U.S. locations in recent months, in Washington, Virginia, New York and a Los Angeles suburb. "Certain locations work better than others, and after an assessment, we've made the decision to close these Amazon Fresh locations," Amazon spokesperson Griffin Buch said in a statement. "We're working closely with affected employees to help them find new roles within Amazon wherever possible." At one Fresh supermarket in La Verne, California, employees were told to gather for an all-hands meeting on Wednesday, according to an internal message viewed by CNBC. Last week, Amazon said it intends to close 14 Fresh grocery stores in the U.K. and convert its five other locations there into Whole Foods markets. Amazon said it regularly evaluates its store portfolio, which can lead to opening, reopening, relocating or closing certain locations. It's also been culling its footprint of Go cashierless convenience stores. Amazon has been determined to become a major grocery player for nearly two decades. The company launched Amazon Fresh in 2007, then a pilot project for fresh food delivery, before acquiring upscale chain Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in 2017, its biggest purchase on record. Amazon debuted its Fresh grocery chain in 2020, with an eye toward mass-market shoppers. The rollout has been turbulent since its early days. In 2023, Amazon announced it would shut some Fresh stores and halt further openings temporarily as it evaluated how to make the chain stand out for shoppers. While it's closing Fresh stores, Amazon continues to "innovate and invest in making grocery shopping easier, faster, and more affordable," Buch said. Buch said that Amazon serves 150 million U.S. customers with millions of "grocery and everyday essentials available for online delivery, pick-up, or in store shopping." On Wednesday, Amazon also launched a new "price-conscious" grocery brand that will be offered online and in its physical stores. Jassy and other company executives have touted the success of sales of "everyday essentials" within its online grocery business, which refers to items such as canned goods, paper towels, dish soap and snacks. Jassy told investors at the company's annual shareholder meeting in May that he remains "bullish" on grocery, calling it a "significant business" for Amazon.

Sean "Diddy" Combs pleaded for mercy, apologized to his sex trafficking accusers, and said he's learned his lesson before he was sentenced on Friday to over four years in prison for transporting hired male escorts across state lines for "freak offs" with ex-girlfriends. "My actions were disgusting, shameful, and sick," Combs said. Combs said that he wanted to apologize to two of his former girlfriends — R&B singer Cassie Ventura and "Jane" — who both played a central role in his criminal trial and who prosecutors alleged he sex-trafficked and coerced into his freak off sex sessions. "I want to personally apologize, again, to Cassie Ventura for any harm or hurt that I've caused her emotionally or physically," Combs said. The "I'll Be Missing You" rapper also apologized to his mother, saying, while choking back tears, that he had "failed" her as a son. Combs told the judge that he's been "humbled and broken to my core." I really truly am sorry for it all, no matter what they say," he said. "I want your honor to know that, given the chance, people can change. Before Combs addressed the court, six of his children made emotional pleas for why their father should be released from behind bars and told the judge that Combs was a changed man. Ahead of his sentencing hearing, Combs urged the judge, in a four-page letter filed with the court on Thursday, to take mercy on him. "I take full responsibility and accountability for my past wrongs," Combs wrote to Subramanian. "This has been the hardest 2 years of my life, and I have no one to blame for my current reality and situation but myself." Before the sentencing hearing, several people, including Ventura and a former Combs assistant who accused him of rape, filed impact statements with the court. Combs, in his pre-sentencing letter to the judge, said that "the scene and images of me assaulting Cassie play over and over in my head daily." "We are confident that with the support of her family and friends, Ms. Ventura will continue healing knowing that her bravery and fortitude have been an inspiration to so many," they said. Combs has been locked up at a notorious federal Brooklyn jail since his September 2024 arrest and indictment, and he was hoping to soon be released with a sentence of time served. That acquittal allowed Combs to dodge a possible sentence of life in prison. In clearing Combs of those top charges, the jury rejected the US government's claims that the music tycoon sex trafficked Ventura and another ex of his for his freak off sex encounters, and that he ran a criminal enterprise. Ventura, who dated Combs on and off between 2007 and 2018, and another ex-girlfriend who testified under the pseudonym "Jane," told the jury during the trial that they were brutally beaten by Combs. Combs' attorneys argued at his trial that the hip-hop and fashion entrepreneur, once worth close to a billion dollars, had a violent side, but was no sex trafficker.</p>

Meta is ramping up the pressure for its employees to use AI. The Facebook parent company is tracking how extensively its teams are using AI through dashboards it rolled out earlier this year, and it created a game to boost employees' usage, Business Insider has learned. Across Big Tech, companies are dangling both carrots and sticks to get employees on board with AI. Google is monitoring how many extra hours of productivity its engineers are squeezing out each week from AI tools and encouraging staff to try new tools, as Business Insider previously reported. The message is clear: Play along and be rewarded, or risk being left behind. "It's well-known that this is a priority and we're focused on using AI to help employees with their day-to-day work," a Meta spokesperson told Business Insider. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has publicly said the company is driving hard to use AI more internally. Speaking on Joe Rogan's podcast in January, he said he expected that by the end of 2025, Meta would have AI that can perform to the standard of a midlevel engineer. "I'd expect that by the middle to end of next year, AI coding agents are going to be doing a substantial part of AI research and development," Zuckerberg stated. In June, the division had reached a utilization rate of 30%, according to two sources. In other areas of the business, workers use AI to brainstorm ideas, create collaborative workspaces, ask about company policies, and ask it to make suggestions on a draft, and write. Employees are rewarded with badges as they hit different usage level milestones. Three worker-tracking software providers previously told Business Insider that over the past two years, they've seen demand for monitoring employees' AI usage soar. That's because they want to see if AI adoption pays off and unlocks cost savings or productivity gains.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spirit Airlines plans to shrink its fleet by nearly 100 aircraft and exit more than a dozen U.S. markets as part of a sweeping bankruptcy restructuring process, CFO Fred Cromer said on Friday during a virtual meeting with creditors. Spirit Airlines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after a prolonged period of financial strain. The low-cost carrier, which Cromer said currently operates 214 aircraft, is using bankruptcy tools to eliminate unprofitable routes and reduce its network footprint. The strategy is expected to save the company "hundreds of millions of dollars" in costs, Cromer said, allowing it to "support a much smaller and stronger Spirit Airlines." Spirit said in a statement that it filed a motion with the court on Thursday to reject 87 additional aircraft leases. "The motion is subject to court approval, and we continue to engage with key stakeholders, including our lessors, as part of our ongoing restructuring to position Spirit for the future." Industry overcapacity among low-cost carriers combined with low passenger demand, significant downward pressure in pricing, and an influx of low-fare seats at legacy airlines led the company to bankruptcy, Cromer said. "While the industry was hopeful at the beginning of 2025 that there would be a rebound, it didn't happen," he said. He did not specify a deadline for the fleet reduction. "We're talking order of magnitude, reducing that by almost 100 aircraft." In recent weeks, Spirit has announced plans to exit service at more than a dozen U.S. airports, including Hartford, Connecticut, and Minneapolis, Minnesota, and suspended roughly 40 routes as part of its restructuring plan. It is not clear how many of those cuts have already been made. AerCap will pay Spirit $150 million as part of the deal, which resolves their dispute over a deal covering 36 Airbus planes due for delivery between 2027 and 2028.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Senate on Friday once again did not pass dueling funding bills that would have kept the three-day-old government shutdown from stretching into next week. The latest attempts to pass both Republicans' "clean" resolution, which would resume funding at current levels through late November, and Democrats' version, which includes additional health-care funding and other measures, was expected not to succeed. The shutdown is now all but guaranteed to drag on until at least Monday. Both parties' leaders so far have shown more interest in convincing Americans that the other is to blame for the impasse than in working out a compromise. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., on Friday accused his Democratic opponents of being cowed by the far left of their party into obstructing President Donald Trump's agenda. "It's all about President Trump and the Democrats needing to pick a fight to satisfy their far left political base, far left activist organizations who are the tail wagging the dog right now," Thune said. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said earlier on MSNBC that the president bears responsibility. Trump "is in the presidential witness protection program — no one can find him when it comes to the government shutdown issue, because he knows he's responsible for having caused it," Jeffries said. Meanwhile, the funding lapse is expected to lead to the furlough of an estimated 750,000 federal employees and trigger the temporary closure of a slew of government programs and offices. The Trump administration, which was already working to shrink the size of the government, is warning that the shutdown could lead to permanent layoffs of thousands of federal workers — despite that not happening during prior funding lapses. Trump said Thursday that Democrats gave him an "unprecedented opportunity" to cut what he described as "Democrat Agencies." While it was unclear precisely what that meant, Trump's warning came a day after his administration froze $18 billion in Department of Transportation funds for two big infrastructure projects in New York City, and said the Department of Energy had cancelled nearly $8 billion in climate-related projects and other initiatives in 16 states that Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris won in the 2024 election. On Friday morning, the DOT froze another $2.1 billion in federal funds allocated for Chicago's transit system. We want to hear from you.

Have you ever wondered how much money the 1% makes?

While the ultrawealthy often hold their fortune in a mix of assets, the salary earned by the top 1% is still sizable — but it might vary largely depending on which state you look at.

While earning $416,310 a year puts you in the top 1% of earners in West Virginia, it takes over a million dollars to be in the top 1% in Connecticut.

A recent SmartAsset study calculated the income needed — or the income floor — to be in the top 1% of earners in each US state, using 2022 IRS tax return data for individual tax filers adjusted to May 2025 dollars using the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index.

The study, which was released in July, also calculated the number of 2022 tax returns for each state that would be considered in the top 1% of earners.

Here's how each US state fared.

Anthropic, the world's second most valuable AI startup, released a big model upgrade this week. I chatted with Alex Albert, head of developer relations, about the news. I also asked him how he uses AI in his personal life. Albert said he taps Anthropic's Claude chatbot for loads of stuff, but he's been particularly impressed by its "ability with general life administration and management." Claude, and its sibling Claude Code, can access your entire computer, so Albert sometimes asks the chatbot to diagnose issues with his laptop. In one recent example, Chrome seemed to be running slowly. Albert also asked Claude to clean up the digital desktop on his computer. It can then automatically produce reports and articles based on these digital assets, he explained. With access to the web, Claude can also make memes and crop images. Albert has used this capability to create some amusing things to post on X, including an animated GIF of sunglasses sliding down on his face. "Excel art is a whole thing," Albert told me. Beyond fun stuff like this, Claude has gotten very good at Excel, according to Ethan Mollick, a Wharton professor who studies AI use.</p>

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia's swelling drone threat has NATO scrambling for new defenses cheaper than missiles and jets — and deployable at scale, a top alliance commander told Business Insider. Adm. Pierre Vandier, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Transformation, who oversees modernization efforts, said that the alliance is building something like a Walmart of counter-drone capabilities for member states. One of the promising solutions being tested is a new interceptor drone, which costs roughly the same as its Russian target and is less expensive than a missile launched from a fighter jet, he said. "We are working on that, and the goal I've given to my team is a cost-efficient solution in order to match the threat." His comments came just weeks after Russian drones violated Polish airspace during a large-scale attack against Ukraine. The early September incident, widely condemned across Europe, immediately raised questions about NATO air defenses and the cost-efficiency of using fighter jets and missiles to shoot down cheap drones worth just tens of thousands of dollars. It's a problem that Ukraine is facing nightly, with its soldiers tasked to protect cities from swarms of dozens or hundreds of Russian drones. Vandier described the Russian drone threat as industrial in scale. The country produces around 4,000 a month at its factories, and Western intelligence has warned that Moscow could soon be able to expand its attacks against Ukraine from hundreds of drones a night to thousands. Several European officials said the recent drone incursion into Polish airspace was a test of NATO and a probe of its air defenses. The alliance's existing air defense network is mainly focused on targeting expensive and complex threats, such as fighter aircraft or missiles, not cheap drones. Almost immediately after that new Eastern Sentry mission began, fighter jets were scrambled to intercept a Russian drone that had violated Romanian airspace. NATO was already testing solutions to counter threats like Russia's Geran-2, a one-way attack munition used frequently against Ukraine, that can be cheap and mass-produced. The incursions into NATO airspace last month have, however, added a fresh sense of urgency to these efforts. One solution that NATO is eyeing right now is autonomous interceptor drones carrying explosive warheads that can hunt down enemy drones and slam into them. Vandier said that the interceptor drones need to be produced in large numbers and quickly. Then, it becomes a question of which countries buy the systems and how many are deployed. Developing this tech is not one and done, though. "Drones and software change in a matter of weeks," Vandier said. Interceptor drones are not the only solution NATO is looking at; the alliance has also tested radars that can predict trajectories and a wall of small drones to act as a last-resort shield against incoming munitions. And Vandier said directed energy weapons, which use high-power lasers or microwaves, are also under consideration. NATO militaries do have counter-drone capabilities, and a number of them deployed personnel and systems to Denmark ahead of the European summits this week after the country was forced to temporarily close some of its airports due to drone sightings. Since the Russian drone incursion into Polish airspace in September, NATO has cast a wider net and expanded its search for more systems. Vandier said the alliance is putting together a "catalogue of solutions" for member states to then browse and purchase for their militaries. "We are building sort of a c-UAS Walmart," he said, using the term for counter-unmanned aerial systems.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The much-needed modernization of the U.S. Army's battlefield communications network being undertaken by Anduril, Palantir and others is rife with "fundamental security" problems and vulnerabilities, and should be treated as a "very high risk," according to a recent internal Army memo. The two Silicon Valley companies, led by allies of U.S. President Donald Trump, have gained access to the Pentagon's lucrative flow of contracts on the promise of quickly providing less expensive and more sophisticated weapons than the Pentagon's longstanding arms providers. "We cannot control who sees what, we cannot see what users are doing, and we cannot verify that the software itself is secure," the memo says. Palantir and Anduril did not comment for this story. The assessment, seen by Reuters and first reported by Breaking Defense, comes just months after defense drone and software maker Anduril was awarded a $100 million to create a prototype of NGC2 with partners including Palantir, Microsoft and several smaller contractors. Despite the early September memo's scathing critique, Leonel Garciga, Army chief information officer and Chiulli's supervisor, said in a statement to Reuters that the report was part of a process that helped in "triaging cybersecurity vulnerabilities" and mitigating them. In March, the 4th Infantry Division used the system in live-fire artillery training at Fort Carson, Colorado, in an exercise Anduril described as demonstrating faster and more reliable performance than legacy systems. The Army memo identifies some major security gaps. The report says the system allows any authorized user to access all applications and data regardless of their clearance level or operational need. As a result, "Any user can potentially access and misuse sensitive" classified information, the memo states, with no logging to track their actions. Other deficiencies highlighted in the memo include the hosting of third-party applications that have not undergone Army security assessments. One application revealed 25 high-severity code vulnerabilities. Three additional applications under review each contain over 200 vulnerabilities requiring assessment, according to the document.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI now has two of the top three free apps in Apple's App Store, and its new video generation app Sora has snagged the coveted No. The artificial intelligence startup launched Sora on Tuesday, and it allows users to generate short-form AI videos, remix videos created by other users and post them to a shared feed. Sora is only available on iOS devices and is invite-based, which means users need a code to access it. Despite these restrictions, Sora has secured the top spot in the App Store, ahead of Google's Gemini and OpenAI's generative chatbot ChatGPT. "It's been epic to see what the collective creativity of humanity is capable of so far," Bill Peebles, head of Sora at OpenAI, wrote in a post on X on Friday. "Team is iterating fast and listening to feedback." OpenAI said the model is capable of creating scenes and sounds with "a high degree of realism," according to a blog post. The startup's first video and audio generation model, Sora, was announced in February 2024. OpenAI said it has taken steps to address potential safety concerns around the Sora app, including giving users explicit control over how their likeness is used on the platform. But some of the initial videos posted to the app, including one that depicts OpenAI CEO Sam Altman shoplifting, have sparked debates about its utility, potential for harm and legality. "It is easy to imagine the degenerate case of AI video generation that ends up with us all being sucked into an RL-optimized slop feed," Altman wrote in a post on X on Tuesday. "The team has put great care and thought into trying to figure out how to make a delightful product that doesn't fall into that trap, and has come up with a number of promising ideas."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stock markets are due a "drawdown" in the next year or two after years of being propelled to record highs by an AI frenzy, according to Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon. "Markets run in cycles, and whenever we've historically had a significant acceleration in a new technology that creates a lot of capital formation, and therefore lots of interesting new companies around it, you generally see the market run ahead of the potential ... there are going to be winners and losers," he said at Italian Tech Week in Turin, Italy, on Friday. "You're going to see a similar phenomenon here," he said. "I wouldn't be surprised if in the next 12 to 24 months, we see a drawdown with respect to equity markets ... An AI boom has gripped global markets in recent years, with a slew of new technologies, multibillion-dollar deals and the continued rise of ChatGPT-developer OpenAI. The buzz around AI has helped to push indexes on Wall Street and beyond to record highs, even as the major U.S. averages were dented earlier this year by President Donald Trump's trade policies. However, as investors have continued to seek out opportunities in AI, concerns have been raised about the possibility of a bubble bursting somewhere down the line. "And when [investors are] excited, they tend to think about the good things that can go right, and they diminish the things you should be skeptical about that can go wrong ... The extent of that will depend on how long this [bull run] goes," he added. Solomon is not alone in having concerns about current market levels. Speaking at the same event, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said Friday that artificial intelligence is currently in an "industrial bubble." And earlier this week, veteran investor Leon Cooperman told CNBC that we are in the late innings of a bull market where bubbles can form — something Warren Buffett had warned about. Karim Moussalem, chief investment officer of equities at Selwood Asset Management, meanwhile, warned of "enormous risks" on the horizon for the AI trade which could rapidly unravel. "The AI trade is beginning to resemble one of the great speculative manias of market history," Moussalem, who runs a market-neutral equity strategy at the London-based hedge fund, said in a post on LinkedIn. But while Solomon predicted some money would be lost, he also appeared optimistic about artificial intelligence. I'm not going to bed every night worried about what will happen next," Solomon said Friday. "Generally speaking, I think what's super exciting is the technology is expanding, new companies are being formed, and the potential of this technology deployed into the enterprise can be very, very powerful. — CNBC's Hugh Leask and Yun Li contributed to this report Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration on Friday froze $2.1 billion in Department of Transportation funding for two projects to improve Chicago's transit system. That statement echoed a Trump administration talking point that Democrats in Congress are refusing to vote for a short-term funding agreement that would reopen the government because they insist on providing health-care benefits for "illegal immigrants." Democrats call that claim a lie designed to distract from their goal of continuing the offer of enhanced Affordable Care Act health insurance plan subsidies to more than 20 million Americans. "At a time when federal agents are sowing chaos in Chicago, the Trump administration is holding bipartisan funding hostage," Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said in a social media post on X after the DOT's announcement. "It's attempting to score political points but is instead hurting our economy and the hardworking people who rely on public transit to get to work or school," wrote Pritzker, who, like Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, is a Democrat. The mayor's comment referenced a Trump administration officer to bolster Argentina's sputtering economy with a $20 billion credit line, and a Chicago neighborhood relying on one of the transit improvement projects. "South Siders have waited for more than 50 years for the Red Line Extension," Johnson said, referring to a project that would extend that train line by 5.5 miles with four new stations. "This project will bring 25,000 jobs to the Chicago area and billions in new development. "Right when we are finally on the brink of moving forward, Trump just cut off the funding," Johnson said. Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought first announced the freeze on the Chicago projects on Friday morning. It was the third time in recent days that he revealed funding actions by the Trump administration targeting cities and states led by Democrats. President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers have blamed Democrats in Congress for the shutdown, which hit its third day on Friday. Trump said on Thursday that the shutdown had given him an "unprecedented opportunity" to cut what he called "Democrat Agencies." Vought on Wednesday revealed that the Department of Transportation was freezing $18 billion in federal funding for two major infrastructure projects in New York City. Both Schumer and Jeffries are from New York City. Later that same day, Vought said that the Department of Energy had cancelled nearly $8 billion in funding for climate-related projects and other efforts in 16 states, all of which were won by Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. On Friday, Vought, in a post on X, wrote, "$2.1 billion in Chicago infrastructure projects -- specifically the Red Line Extension and the Red and Purple Modernization Project -- have been put on hold to ensure funding is not flowing via race-based contracting." The Red and Purple Modernization Project is reconstructing infrastructure along those color train lines. DOT later Friday said, "This week, USDOT issued an interim final rule (IFR) barring race- and sex-based contracting requirements from federal grants." "To continue implementation of this rule, USDOT today sent letters to the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) to inform them that" the two CTA projects "are also under administrative review to determine whether any unconstitutional practices are occurring," the DOT said. "Illinois, like New York, is well known to promote race- and sex-based contracting and other racial preferences as a public policy." The DOT also said that Americans "don't care what race or gender construction workers, pipefitters, or electricians are. They just want these massive projects finally built quickly and efficiently." "Benefits for illegal immigrants are not worth potential impacts to important investments in our nation's transportation infrastructure," the department said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TURIN, Italy — Artificial intelligence is currently in an "industrial bubble" but the technology is "real" and will bring big benefits to society, Amazon Founder Jeff Bezos said on Friday. The term bubble usually refers to a period of inflated stock prices or valuations of companies that have disconnected from the fundamentals of a business. Exor CEO John Elkann asked Bezos on stage at Italian Tech Week in Turin, Italy whether there were signs that the current AI industry is in bubble. "This is a kind of industrial bubble," the Amazon founder said. Bezos laid out some of the key characteristics of bubbles, noting that when they happen, stock prices are "disconnected from the fundamentals" of a business. "The second thing that happens is that people get very excited like they are today about artificial intelligence," Bezos added. During bubbles, every experiment or idea gets funded, he told the audience. And that's also probably happening today," Bezos said. This is "very unusual behavior" and yet this kind of activity is happening today, he said without making it clear what company he was referring to. The billionaire however, said that ultimately industrial bubbles could be positive. He pointed to the biotech and pharmaceutical company bubble in the 1990s, which led to the development of some life-saving drugs even though many companies eventually went bust. "The [bubbles] that are industrial are not nearly as bad, it can even be good, because when the dust settles and you see who are the winners, societies benefits from those inventions," Bezos said. Bezos is not the only major business figure warning about an AI bubble. In August, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman reportedly said the AI market is in a bubble, and many investors have also raised the issue. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon on Friday expressed some concerns about stock market levels amid the AI hype. "When [investors are] excited, they tend to think about the good things that can go right, and they diminish the things you should be skeptical about that can go wrong ... There will be a reset, there will be a check at some point, there will be a drawdown," Solomon said at Italian Tech Week. "The extent of that will depend on how long this [bull run] goes." Karim Moussalem, chief investment officer of equities at Selwood Asset Management, said last week that the "AI trade is beginning to resemble one of the great speculative manias of market history."

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Myra Deshmukh, the 39-year-old founder of Leadership Lab and a former Amazon employee living in Montclair, New Jersey. It has been edited for length and clarity. Overall, Amazon has a very heavy writing culture, so we write a lot of documents, emails, memos, press releases, and FAQs. The course I taught was a six-week foundations course in business writing 101, and covered how to write concisely, tell compelling stories, and structure writing — from Slack chats and emails to a six-pager. Email is one of the primary ways we communicate today, and how you show up in an email can make a real difference in how others perceive you. Here are seven things you can try in order to improve your email communication. If it's just for their information, include "FYI" in the subject. For example, a good subject line is: Marketing Proposal - Feedback Needed by 8/13. I avoid using "Dear ___," in work situations, as it's a very personal greeting, like something I'd use when writing to a close relative. I also wouldn't use "hey," as it's very casual and can come across as too informal to different generations or cultures. Not using a greeting and just writing their name could be perceived as too curt. But tailor to your audience; if it's with my manager, I may drop the greeting to answer their questions directly, but if it's with my skip level or higher, I may keep the greeting for some formality and respect. Before writing an email, you should know the purpose of what you're writing; your email should be concise and specific. You should have one objective, not a million. This might look like: "Hi name, I hope you're well today. By writing it this way, you're not leaving people to read through and figure out the point of the email. This is especially true if you're writing for an ask, for feedback, or something that you need somebody to reply to. We use filler words or phrases to soften the ask, or to make an email more personal, but it really just comes across as less confident. Instead, try: "Can you send me feedback on this marketing proposal by the end of the day, [insert date]," and then add some context. This way, it becomes more of an action or direct ask, versus a passive statement. If it's not an ask, but rather, you're telling someone information, you could say, "The marketing campaign that we ran last week was very successful; it exceeded our revenue goal." You can include a short intro, like, "Hope you had a great weekend," but don't make it so long that it distracts from the purpose of your email. When it comes to emailing someone, I'd suggest staying away from emojis for the same reason you avoid language that's too casual — it can be misinterpreted. For example, you might send a winky face with a completely platonic intention, but the person reading it could think, "Why are they winking at me? You just never know with emojis, so I'd recommend staying away from them. It's very hard to read tone over email, harmless emojis included. I think punctuation like exclamation points is fine in an email if you're trying to convey excitement or enthusiasm. For example, "We're so excited about tomorrow's launch!" is totally appropriate, but "We're so excited about tomorrow's launch!!!" Use your judgment on how many you need for the whole email. As with any special formatting, use it intentionally. If every sentence in your email has an exclamation, it loses emphasis. It's the same with bolding; if everything is bolded, nothing stands out. You could say, "Hey, just following up on this, I would love your feedback." I would love the feedback by tomorrow, if you can." Putting yourself in the other person's shoes, you realize a reminder isn't annoying — it can be really helpful. When writing an email, you should always write it as if it's going to be forwarded to that person's boss. Good communication helps you be seen as a great leader at work and makes you more likely to get promoted. If you have to invest in one skill to enhance your career, invest in clear, effective communication — and that includes email.</p>

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Christopher Zhang, 27, the founder of Cryozone China. His words have been edited for length and clarity. I left high school two months into my senior year. I'd always been different, and that difference gave me the determination to eventually open my own business in China. I grew up in Shanghai, and before dropping out in 2016, I spent most of my free time working part-time jobs: English-Mandarin translator, assistant for a nightclub owner, PA for A-list celebrities, and even a venture capital intern. I never saw higher education as the only road to financial success or — more importantly — happiness. I wanted out of the race and to chart my own course. My Asian parents, two high-performing executives with degrees from top universities, didn't support their only son dropping out. They figured it was just a "gap year." But when I started succeeding at work, they ultimately accepted my decision. Within a week of dropping out of school, I had an interview that turned into a job offer. That's how I started as an account manager at Toplist China, a SaaS company. I managed bigger budgets, took on new clients, and stepped up to more responsibility. Work slowed down during COVID-19, so I threw myself into fitness. One night in November 2020, I was up late reading about its benefits when a friend messaged me asking if I knew of any cryotherapy offerings in Shanghai. That's when I realized I wasn't the only person in a city of 25 million who was interested in it. That's where the idea for my company came from. There are clients who add on additional services, which can extend a visit to an hour. By 2022, I'd phased out Toplist entirely and started expanding revenue streams: partnering with manufacturers to build and sell affordable, high-quality cryotherapy chambers worldwide, and I opened a second location in Shenzhen. The launch wouldn't have happened without an investor and mentor I met at a luxury watch convention. When a bad supplier set us back, we had to invest another $100,000 on top of the $120,000 we'd already spent to switch to a local factory that could actually support us. Plenty of "great business ideas" never make it past the bar counter. Making a living while providing my community with an extra option for a healthy lifestyle has kept me focused and assured me that this is the right path. My favorite quote is a reply from Elon Musk on words of encouragement for entrepreneurs: "If you need encouragement to start a company, don't do it." Reflecting on my career so far, I've learned that success isn't just about financial gain, it's about creating something meaningful and finding encouragement in that. I'm living proof that the path to fulfillment can be different for everyone.</p>
