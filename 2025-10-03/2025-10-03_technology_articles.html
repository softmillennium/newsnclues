                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The company will wind down operations and end its service to customers on October 15. While it's not clear whether any of Roi's technology will transfer over to OpenAI or which unit Vishwajith will join, the acquisition clearly aligns with OpenAI's bet on personalization and life management as the next layer of AI products. Roi brings a specialized team that has already tried to solve personalization in finance at scale — a challenge whose lessons can be applied more broadly. New York-based Roi was founded in 2022 and has raised $3.6 million in early-stage funding from investors like Balaji Srinivasan, Spark Capital, Gradient Ventures, and Spacecadet Ventures, according to PitchBook data. Its mission was to aggregate a user's financial footprint, including stocks, crypto, DeFi, real-estate, and NFTs, into one app that can track funds, provide insights, and help people make trades. “We started Roi 3 years ago to make investing accessible to everyone by building the most personalized financial experience,” Vishwajith wrote in a post on X. When signing up, users could personalize Roi by providing information like what they do for a living and how they wanted Roi to respond to them. In one telling example that Roi posted on X, the sample user wrote: “Talk to me like I'm a Gen-Z kid with brain rot. Cause of the tariff announcements, you took an L today of $32,459.12…Based on your risk preference this might be an opportunity to buy the dip.” That vision dovetails with OpenAI's existing consumer efforts, including Pulse, which generates personalized news and content reports for users as they sleep; the Sora app, a TikTok competitor filled with AI-generated content, including personal cameos from users; and Instant Checkout, a feature that lets users shop and make purchases directly in ChatGPT. The deal also comes as OpenAI beefs up its consumer applications team,  led by former Instacart CEO Fidji Simo. It's a further signal that OpenAI isn't just trying to be an API provider, but wants to build its own end-user apps. Vishwajith, alongside his co-founder Chip Davis, used to work at Airbnb, where he developed a knack for optimizing user behavior to drive revenue.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Naveen Rao, who was formerly the head of artificial intelligence at Databricks, is in talks to raise $1 billion at a $5 billion valuation for a new startup, called Unconventional, Inc., that's building a new type of computer, according to four people familiar with discussions. Databricks is also said to be investing in Rao's new company, Bloomberg reported last month. Rao has already raised hundreds of millions and plans to begin building the startup without waiting for the full $1 billion round to close, our sources said. Rao declined to comment, although he did publicly acknowledge the new startup on X last week, confirming its name and describing its hoped-for product as “rethinking the foundations of a computer to build a new substrate for intelligence that is as efficient as biology. Founded by Rao in 2020 with a focus on training and deploying large AI models, MosaicML raised $33.7 million from investors, including Lux Capital, DCVC, Playground Global, and Samsung Next, according to PitchBook. Prior to MosaicML, Rao co-founded the machine learning platform Nervana Systems, which Intel Corp. acquired in 2016 for reportedly more than $400 million. Rao, who spent over two years as VP of AI at Databricks (now valued at $100 billion and generating $4 billion in ARR), left the company last month to focus on his new startup, according to his LinkedIn profile and earlier reporting by Bloomberg. Our sources say Rao's vision will essentially compete with Nvidia by designing a novel AI machine that includes both custom silicon chips and server infrastructure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While he's keeping details close to the vest, the co-founder of digital remittance company Remitly told GeekWire this week that he's launching Arkero AI, a startup that aims to help sports organizations and the live events industry as a whole leverage artificial intelligence to their advantage. Gulati said a lot of business owners are stuck on a key question: How do I use AI to unlock value in my business? For the past six months, he's also served as a technical advisor to Seattle Sounders FC helping the Major League Soccer club with its AI and tech strategy. Specifically, he said his work with the Sounders allowed him to connect some of the dots on his latest venture “where I think we can create some interesting business value.” Gulati is working on assembling a team and attracting investors. “Seattle is an amazing, talent-dense place for us,” he said. “It's a great place to build a company, and we're going to double down on that and build another big company here.” Publicly traded on Nasdaq, Remitly now boasts a market value of $3.3 billion. Arkero is looking for what Gulati calls “AI native product builders.” While he wasn't ready to share names yet, Gulati said he's creating an investor roster that includes some “big hitters and some team owners around the nation,” adding that he's fortunate to be in a position where investors want to back him again. Arkero has also attracted three initial design partners in the U.S. and England.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This worked nicely until the tensions in Europe lead to more cyberattacks rolling in and suddenly you have people not being able to buy food, medicine, and so forth. Not too long after, there was a government advisory urging people to keep some cash reserves in case a larger cyberattack happens, but cultural habits at large are hard to change. This is of course a coarse simplification of the context, but might help understand this incentive a bit better. Are you sure this isn't impression you've gotten from isolated reactions involving a small number of individuals, perhaps just a single individual? I can't relate to the sentiment at all, having lived here for just over three decades and experiencing the popularity shift from cash to debit card. I can, in fact, not recall a single time ever that someone has divulged the opinion that they consider cash "dirty and criminal".More than anything else the Swede's favor of debit card is the convenience. Second to that I would say is the security of not immediately losing funds if you misplace the card or it being stolen - it feels less risky carrying a debit card, in particular if you're the type who prefers having more than a few "tens" on you in case you'd need or want to buy something.

This is what people think of when someone "uses cash". Not hauling tens of thousands to buy a used car or to settle the bill for having your bathroom tiled, which would be cases I too would raise an eyebrow over. If a merchant tries to promote cash options I immediately think they're doing it for tax evasion reasons - not because of the touted reason that “card payments cost more to process” (they don't once you factor in the cost of handling cash). You're probably putting this solely in the context of using cash for significantly large purchases, e.g. higher 4 digit sum or above, or as in your example a craftsman who want to exempt it from his or her accounting. You are spewing complete nonsense.Here's some perfectly normal stuff I use cash for in sweden on the regular:- flea markets- strawberry stand by the road- unmanned vegetable shop has a cash bin and a pay-for-what-you-take sign Here's some perfectly normal stuff I use cash for in sweden on the regular:- flea markets- strawberry stand by the road- unmanned vegetable shop has a cash bin and a pay-for-what-you-take sign Tradespeople sometimes request cash payment or provide a good discount for cash payments (well above any fee they would be charged). I guess where you are no one considers this dubious (really???) Someone wanted to split payment on something between cash and a check so they could report the value of the item was lower because it would save them taxes every year. Again, the use of cash was I think a bit dubious.Note: Cash allows you to avoid all sorts of obligations (tax / family support / debt collection and garnishment etc etc), ineligiblity for banking (europe is pretty strict in some cases for example with folks with no legal status with banking) and is still used in things like the drug trade. We also have a local retail establishment that is cash only.

When I joined my gamedev studio I had colleagues asking me why I had cash, and many of them didn't even recognise what it looked like (there was a switchover of the notes a year or two prior).There was an insinuation that I would use it for drugs. So, I suspect that the parent is right here. There was an insinuation that I would use it for drugs.

I don't love the law, but having cash on its own is not grounds for seizure. Having expensive goods that you cannot explain how you managed to pay for is what they are targeting, according to your source.This is basically a law that takes your expensive shit away if you are too stupid to launder your ill-gotten cash. This is basically a law that takes your expensive shit away if you are too stupid to launder your ill-gotten cash. Which effectively means that using the "price base amount" value of ~59k SEK in 2025, you are subject to asset forfeiture at the whims of any police officer once you have more than 600 bucks in your wallet or under the mattress.But I'm sure they will only use it on brown gang bangers or knife wielding foreign drunks and not law abiding citizens such as myself, so it's fine! But I'm sure they will only use it on brown gang bangers or knife wielding foreign drunks and not law abiding citizens such as myself, so it's fine! in a conversation about cash in Sweden, and posted an article about how there is a law that allows police to seize goods in certain circumstance.I pointed out that cash != luxury goods.I already said it was a law I don't agree with. But it also isn't a law that says that police can just take cash from you according to your sources . The section that you quoted doesn't seem to support your assertion about cash either, but I need the rest of the context.In reading the law it is allowed to seize cash under very specific circumstances, but simply possessing cash is not enough evidence to seize it.Cash seizure ("penningbeslag") can be used in an investigation concerning independent forfeiture ("utredning om självständigt förverkande").The initiation of an investigation and the use of "penningbeslag" are contingent on the "reason to assume that property originates from criminal activity." This implies that merely possessing cash, without any connection or suspicion of it being linked to criminal activity, would not be sufficient grounds for seizure under this law. There needs to be an antecedent suspicion that the cash is proceeds of crime.An investigation for independent forfeiture should be initiated "if there is reason to assume that property originates from criminal activity" (2 kap. 1 §).Therefore, the primary circumstance for cash seizure is when there is reason to believe that the cash originates from criminal activity.> You can put lipstick on a pig all you want, but if you reverse the burden of proof from "we have to prove your money is dirty" to "you have to prove your money is clean", that is a very clear cut case of "possessing cash is grounds for seizure" to me.Swedish law does not describe such a reversal for the initial act of seizure or investigation. As previously discussed, the law states: "En utredning om självständigt förverkande ska inledas om det finns anledning att anta att egendom härrör från brottslig verksamhet" (2 kap. This means there must first be a "reason to assume" that the property (including cash) originates from criminal activity before an investigation is initiated and seizure measures like "penningbeslag" (cash seizure) are applied.> Section 4 If the property has been seized and the value of what may be confiscated does not exceed one tenth of the price base amount according to Chapter 2, Sections 6 and 7 of the Social Insurance Code, a question about confiscation of the property may be examined by 1. a police officer, or 2. another employee of the Police Authority or the Security Service appointed by the respective authority.This section, "Beslut om förverkande" (Decisions on forfeiture), discusses who can decide on the forfeiture of already seized property (beslag or penningbeslag) if its value is below a certain threshold.

Deviation from the collective way is always suspect. Very long time ago I was approached by a group of seemingly friendly people asking for direction, then I felt sharp object to my belly and they told me to walk slowly towards cash point. When cards were not popular, I would have small amount of cash in the wallet and anything more substantial hidden in a sock or elsewhere. I guess it can be the same with cards - have a card with small amount and actual card hidden, but it is not as easy to hide as cash. Then you have whole other kettle of fish - banking apps. There's been instances of people being forced to do transfer at knifepoint. For that reason I don't use any apps, apart from throwaway bank account - again with small balance just in case. Shame more banks are restricting web access, which I think is most secure. Just to reiterate how ubiquitous Swish and BankID are here: 99.9% of Swedish residents age 18-67 have BankID (8.6M users), while Swish has 8.7M private users, and 93% of those users send or receive money via Swish at least once per month. That said, nobody thinks of cash as dirty, just annoying. Also our payment system has always been able to work offline, because it started rolling out in the 80s. As a swede, your statement is outlandish and false.We use cash all of the time. So if anyone wants to send you money, they can just open Swish and enter your phone number (or scan a QR code) and send you some. 99.9% of Swedish residents age 18-67 have BankID (8.6M users), while Swish has 8.7M private users (93% of which use Swish at least once per month). 99.9% of Swedish residents age 18-67 have BankID (8.6M users), while Swish has 8.7M private users (93% of which use Swish at least once per month). When counting money is just arithmetics and never cash, something is missing, and it's very clear in many young kids. they give credit like candy because being online and low value only it's easier to avoid (or swallow) fraud.forcing their hand to accept offline sales mean they can't decide on the spot, and now those 5k credit lines which they only allow transactions for sub 100 purchases at a time will be wide open for offline fraud they can't detect, and which visa already know how to handle/sustain.this will probably be lobbied elsewhere soon. forcing their hand to accept offline sales mean they can't decide on the spot, and now those 5k credit lines which they only allow transactions for sub 100 purchases at a time will be wide open for offline fraud they can't detect, and which visa already know how to handle/sustain.this will probably be lobbied elsewhere soon. And now that Japan has fully embraced credit card touch payments, it is losing market share to Visa, Mastercard, etc. > Mondex was a smart card electronic cash system, implemented as a stored-value card and owned by Mastercard.> Mondex allowed users to use its electronic card as they would with cash, enabling peer-to-peer offline transfers between cards, which did not need any authorization, via Mondex ATMs, computer card readers, personal 'wallets' and specialized telephones. This offline nature of the system and other unique features made Mondex stand out from leading competitors at the time, such as Visa Cash, which was a closed system and was much closer in concept to a traditional payment cards' transactional operation.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondex > Mondex allowed users to use its electronic card as they would with cash, enabling peer-to-peer offline transfers between cards, which did not need any authorization, via Mondex ATMs, computer card readers, personal 'wallets' and specialized telephones.

I assume this is a trust in-credit-based system because they don't accept debit cards, i.e. if you are worth being trusted with a card you can have your sandwich now and we will take care of the bank processing once we are on the ground. So maybe this will be like we trust you enough with basic goods that once we get a connection things will be sorted out situation? The card has a variety of risk counters on it that allow it to securely decide whether an offline transaction can proceed, at least some of which are also exposed to the terminal which can have its own separate policy. I imagine internally the banks and payment gateways have a huge variety of internal related tuneables. Calling a call centre to verify every transaction is too expensive so only purchases over certain limits came in following BofA/Visa - and that stated that way till the late eighties when larger stores started using back office to talk to Visa network etc. but even so the ability to do live updates and verification was too much and there were weird cacheing tricksSo banks could easily approve or be liable for transactions they would prefer not to approve - so they only gave credit to the rich at first, and then to those who paid back regularly. This info was shared and became credit reference agencies - because the credit card companies shared it initially like casinos but the abuse and mistakes brought legislationI think what i am saying is our consumer credit culture was not designed, it just grew.

IIRC, the merchant gets paid if hitting a credit limit or similar decline reason. The card holder then gets hit with a financial penalty (usurious interest rates, or extra charges). If the card has been stolen, it ends up in a big phonebook-like book for offline use (otherwise the merchant just called it in for big purchases). In order to leave an impression on the carbon paper (I should probably explain that, too, huh? In the past embossed credit and debit cards were both accepted on planes. That's why they were embossed in the first place: for offline processing which in even more distant path was the only option. Later CC machines and offline chip/stripe transactions co-existed with online transactions.Normally (at least in Europe) you couldn't get an embossed card, even a debit one, without proving your credit worthiness. The possibility of offline transactions assumes overdraft — the same as with check books.When online transactions appeared, banks started to issue Visa Electron and Maestro cards which didn't work offline, could explicitly prohibit overdraft and were easier to get.But nowadays all boundaries gradually disappeared. Nothing is embossed, Visa Electron doesn't exist, bank issue debit cards with credit codes. It's all much simpler and more confusing at the same time.

And probably in more than just a bit in a packet, as, for example, paying with debit Visas or MasterCards (normal ones, not Electron resp. Maestro) in the Netherlands (where locals almost universally have credit cards) is something of a crapshoot. Some payment providers ask up front to simplify the flows as it's not totally trivial to determine what sort of card it is, and also because different fees apply - historically some merchants added specific fees to basket etc. (less so nowadays but the UI convention sticks) And because the same card can be both. AFAIK, they're separate applications within the same chip, and the terminal has to select which one to use before starting. Edit: OK maybe there's different level of trust and some take a leap of faith :)  In my experience debit didn't work but it appears that its not the same everywhere. When a debit card prompts for a PIN, don't enter it, press submit, and it runs as credit instead of debit, but functionally works the same as far as the card-holder is concerned. It might take slightly longer to settle, and the merchant likely gets charged higher fees, but it works just fine. When I got my first debit card 20+ years ago my bank specifically told me to select credit and using it, instead of using it with the PIN as a debit card.These days I've noticed the systems tend to auto-prompt for the PIN instead of asking credit or debit. But skipping it functionally works the same as pressing credit used to. But skipping it functionally works the same as pressing credit used to. Even without any cellphone/internet coverage they'll let you pay, but only with credit. "Starbucks does not use two phase commit":https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/ramblings/18_s... I guess this is similar: how do you make trustworthy decisions that seem to inherently depend on the network, in the absence of a network? A dog-eared dollar with a bunch of phone numbers on it, half-torn ... the merchant doesn't have to accept it.How do you do these things digitally? Periodic issue seems pretty straightforward ... if you have a network. Token issuance, similarly, needs at least occasional communication with other nodes in the network.So there's a local dwell capability.Is this part of the same reaction we saw with Denmark starting to have emergency stores within 50 km of every Dane? Is this motivated by a need to prepare for war? Periodic issue seems pretty straightforward ... if you have a network.

Is this a typo where they meant to say “the offline function”?If I'm reading this right, the goal is to allow food, fuel, and medicine purchases with card + PIN in offline mode.Seems like a reasonable goal. I wonder what the technical details will look like. Will there be a periodically updated list of cancelled cards/accounts distributed to endpoints? Even a hashed list of all cards cancelled before their expiration date within a country is a reasonable amount of data for modern storage systems.Or would they simply rely on the ability to track down account owners by their originally registered contact info in the event that someone gets an invalid transaction through during an offline period?

It's already a thing, the EMVCo standard predates ubiquitous internet connectivity. Mass transit systems typically use it, airlines used to for in-flight purchases before the advent of reliable WiFi.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMV#Offline_data_authenticat...It is somewhat common to maintain a denylist of known fraudulent cards, but as you note the main mitigation is on the bank to track the card down. One of the key things you need to figure out with an offline payment system - and what I imagine is needed here - is a consensus on who has the liability for offline transactions and what the dollar limits are.

That's why many merchants have their terminals set to require online payments. That's why many merchants have their terminals set to require online payments. EMV (chip cards) can have a small amount of local smarts, so it is typical for example to insist on going online for a large transaction or if the card has performed too many offline transactions since last going online. The card maker decides these rules, so the bank gets to ensure the cards it issues to customers meet whatever requirements it has decided upon, balancing fraud risk against problems with loss of connectivity or services being down.So I doubt they'd bother doing some sort of ad hoc revocation technique. So I doubt they'd bother doing some sort of ad hoc revocation technique. However, it requires that all the parties involved (issuer, acquirer, payment network, merchant) allow it, and there are certain limits. One of the linked documents[2] in the riksbank press release has more details about what they expect from these parties.

Most of these reasons just sound like fee-issues to me. The fact that checks somehow cost less to use than debit/credit cards sounds ridiculous tbh, especially with all the added handling that must go into dealing with them (it just seems so inefficient). > My company requires me to send it a check for the amount I receive from the government for jury dutyThat just sounds like something that shouldn't be allowed. My company claims that allowing me to have both my regular pay and the government pay would be considered an over-payment, and the accountants say it triggers all kinds of messy things.However, at the same time, it is illegal to do this in some American states where we have offices.

At least in the US, individual businesses don't like dealing with credit because of the transaction fees but are kind of forced to thanks to everybody else taking credit everywhere.Of course, the big chains love credit and are happy to pay the transaction cost because it lets them audit all the transactions and increase their control over local managers and employees. Of course, the big chains love credit and are happy to pay the transaction cost because it lets them audit all the transactions and increase their control over local managers and employees. I wonder if that hinders tax evasion at all since there's presumably a pretty reliable paper trail of cash transactions. Clearly the right thing for Sweden and others to do. Also worrying that even 3yrs into the Russian invasion, bordering countries are urgently increasing their preparedness for future conflicts. Most people here pay by card and I would say the vast majority use debit cards. A lot of people don't even have credit cards, unlike the US.I'm no expert so may be wrong about some of this, and maybe huge events like these have these systems in place due to the risk of having to shut down bars etc. Many events are completely cash less these days. I'm no expert so may be wrong about some of this, and maybe huge events like these have these systems in place due to the risk of having to shut down bars etc. Many events are completely cash less these days. I suspect this could be implemented with just policy and config changes, with no need to reissue cards or deploy new readers. Payment terminals might be trickier as we've observed during outages that they currently don't fall back to offline transactions. But their software and business rules can obviously be updated. The bigger challenge is an offline terminal that can easy accumulate tenths of USD in case of a long outage. But then compared with cards the terminal may have better protection. imo, the mandate creates an interesting technical constraint on any CBDC standard, where the offline mode limits the effectiveness of a "turn off" of someone's money, as there will always be some feature where they can use their money to buy food and fuel. For now I am interpreting this mandate as constructive to civil liberties. although heavily misunderstood, this is built into cryptocurrencies since day 1 (many critics have long thought crypto requires power and internet access, many proponents also don't know otherwise)with card networks learning from competition and functionally being public-only keys, this should be even simpler to implement with card networks learning from competition and functionally being public-only keys, this should be even simpler to implement Even better, when you're back online the network will run a sanity check to protect against the evils of inflation. (Note: inflation-check fees will vary between 0 and 100% per payee.) (Note: inflation-check fees will vary between 0 and 100% per payee.) Checking the signature on some blob that says "this be money" is not enough. For example, when each transaction is done, both parties might keep a cryptographic proof which they are required to submit once they are online again.Failing to submit could result in a small fine (to encourage submission) and double spending which can then be detected could result in a large fine (or even a prison sentence), for example.There is, perhaps, a privacy issue, just like with blockchain. But it's not more of an issue than online transactions. But it's not more of an issue than online transactions. There is, perhaps, a privacy issue, just like with blockchain.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's plenty of talk online about echo chambers and the way that certain ideas can get amplified when stuck in a silo of like-minded people. But the controversy earlier this year over American Eagle's “Good Jeans” advertising campaign featuring Sydney Sweeney is an example of how motivated political actors can pluck otherwise insulated discourse out of parts of social media and spin it into full-blown drama to serve their own means. According to data collected by open-source social intelligence platform Open Measures, pushback against the American Eagle ad campaign, which was criticized as dabbling in eugenics and winking at white supremacists, was a relatively small part of the conversation surrounding the marketing effort. But if you caught wind of the discourse about it, you'd think it was the only thing anyone was talking about. By July 27, the researchers found that conservative personalities started to boost selected posts to suggest that liberals were outraged by the ads. The accounts used this to generate backlash against what they painted as the entire Left crying “racism” about a jeans advertisement. But, as the New York Times reported in August, most of the posts that got presented as representative of a larger political ideology had fewer than 500 views before being amplified. Meanwhile, the amplification efforts were being done by accounts like LibsOfTikTok, which has 4.5 million followers on Twitter. Open Measures further notes, “a larger share of posts discussing the ads that also claimed the ads echoed bigoted ideologies were represented on alt-platforms with predominantly conservative communities than those without, indicating that the claims were more popular with conservative critics of liberals than with liberals themselves.” The Right managed to take a handful of outliers, turn them into the representatives of something bigger, and then spin up an entire effort to push back against that narrative that it amplified in the first place. If you thought social content was trash already, just wait, the worst is yet to come. Doesn't that make more sense than lots of people caring about Cracker Barrel? You won't just have to deal with angry Plave fans, but possibly the courts as well. They went from banning social media to being run by it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The good news is that we can still write our Scala `val`s and `var`s (`const` and `let`) in the source code, enjoying good scoping and good performance. There are some relatively simple heuristics where you can tell without escape analysis that a variable will not be referenced before initialization.The obviously bad constructions are references in the same scope that happen before the declaration. It'd be nice if these were an early errors, but alas, so keep the TDZ check. Then you have hoisted closures even if they're after the initializer (eg, var and function keyword declarations). These might run before the initializer too.But everything else that comes after the initializer: access in the same or nested scope and access in closures in non-hoisted declarations, can't possibly run before the initializer and doesn't need the TDZ check.I believe this check is cheap enough to run during parsing. The reason for not pursuing it was that there wasn't a benchmark that showed TDZ checks were a problem. It'd be nice if these were an early errors, but alas, so keep the TDZ check.

The reason for not pursuing it was that there wasn't a benchmark that showed TDZ checks were a problem. function f() { return x; // Syntax parsing fails here. } you would get the equivalent of a ReferenceError for x when f() tried to use it (well, refer to it) at the commented line. But in JavaScript, this successfully returns 4, because `let` inherits the weird hoisting behavior of `var` and `function`. Would that have a 50/50 chance of returning the outer x? Would the engine have to swap which x is referred to in f1 when x gets initialized?TDZ is also terrible because the engines have to look up at runtime whether a lexical variable's binding has been initialized yet. You can't constant fold even a `const`, because `const v = 7` means at runtime "either 7 or nothing at all, not even null or undefined".In my opinion, TDZ was a mistake. The right thing to do when introducing let/const would have been to make any capture of a lexical variable disable hoisting of the containing function. would raise a ReferenceError for `useX`, because it has not yet been declared at that point in the syntactic scope. which in current JavaScript also either returns 1 or throws a ReferenceError. I'm not against hoisting functions, and removing function hoisting would have not been possible anyway. It's binding to something not in its lexical scope, an uninitialized slot in its static environment. That's a weird special case that has to be handled in the engine and considered in user code.

It basically means you can always override anything, which allows for monkey patching and proxying and adapter patterns and circular imports… These are all nasty things to accidentally encounter, but they can also be powerful tools when used deliberately.These hoisting tricks all play an important role in ensuring backwards compatibility.

It's much easier to reason about when your variables aren't going to escape past the end of the block.In non-GC languages going out of scope can also be a trigger to free the contents of the variable. This is useful for situations like locking where you can put the minimal span of code that requires the lock into a scope and take a lock which automatically unlocks at the end of the scope, for example.JavaScript's hoisting and scoping feel natural to people who started in JS, but most people who came from other languages find it surprising.

In  function example(measurement) { console.log(calculation); // undefined - accessible! Why does the author say `calculation` and `i` are leaking? They're not even defined at that point (they come later in the code), and we're seeing “undefined” which, correct me if I'm wrong, is the JS way of saying “I have no idea what this thing is”.

They're not even defined at that point (they come later in the code), and we're seeing “undefined” which, correct me if I'm wrong, is the JS way of saying “I have no idea what this thing is”. This is different than with let/const where the variable would not be in scope at that point in the function. An undefined value bound to a variable is not the same as "I have no idea what this thing is". That would be the reference errors seen with let/const. > As of TypeScript 5.0, the project's output target was switched from es5 to es2018 as part of a transition to ECMAScript modules. This meant that TypeScript could rely on the emit for native (and often more-succinct) syntax supported between ES2015 and ES2018. One might expect that this would unconditionally make things faster, but surprise we encountered was a slowdown from using let and const natively!So they don't transpile to ES5, and that is the issue.1: https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/52924 So they don't transpile to ES5, and that is the issue.1: https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/52924 I can always rely on FAANGs to make things unnecessarily confusing and ugly. They cite a surprising 8% performance boost in some cases by using var. They did a great job of explaining javascript variable hoisting, but that's all that they have explained. They are only talking about one javascript engine (node). They didn't test any other engine or go into the implementation in node. For all we know, this might just be a poorly optimized code path in node that needs a little love, but the author didn't bother doing any investigation.Looking at the linked github issue, jsc doesn't have the performance penalty. It would have been interesting if the author had investigated why and shared that with us. It would have been interesting if the author had investigated why and shared that with us.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shane Black has brought a lot of entertainment to Hollywood over the years, sometimes as an actor (he played Hawkins in 1987's Predator), but mostly as a filmmaker. But 2018's The Predator, which he co-wrote and directed, misfired both in front of and behind the camera. It was especially disappointing for fans given his long history with the franchise. Black aims to bounce back from The Predator with his current release, a thriller called Play Dirty. But he acknowledges that Dan Trachtenberg, the director who took up Predator after The Predator—and is now steering the entire franchise, with animated film Predator: Killer of Killers and Predator: Badlands releasing this year—deserves a lot of credit. “Dan Trachtenberg saved that franchise,” Black told the Hollywood Reporter. That was a really great mythic take. So, yeah, I'm happy that the franchise is still humming, as you say, and he's the right shepherd for it, at least for now.” Check out when to expect the latest Marvel, Star Wars, and Star Trek releases, what's next for the DC Universe on film and TV, and everything you need to know about the future of Doctor Who.

Chinese company Highlander is building a server pod near Shanghai, where it will be submerged underwater to reduce the power consumption used by the facility for cooling. This isn't the first underwater data center project; Microsoft concluded its own experiment off the coast of Scotland in 2024. Although Microsoft said that it has learned a lot from the project, it did not proceed with a commercial deployment of the system. “Underwater operations have inherent advantages,” Highlander vice president Yang Ye told the Morning Post. Ye also said that it will reduce cooling energy consumption by around 90%. There are also significant challenges that Highlander had to overcome. Salt water and electronics do not mix well, so the company had to take special precautions to protect its systems. One technique Highlander uses involves a coating with glass flakes to protect the steel capsule from corrosion. Although placing data centers underwater will help reduce their power consumption, some experts are concerned about the effects of ocean warming due to continuous heat output. There hasn't been enough research on this, University of Hull Marine Ecologies Andrew Want told SCMP. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Nevertheless, the Highlander claims that an independent assessment of its test project showed that temperature changes were still within acceptable limits.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Speaking by video at the UN Climate Summit in New York last week, China's president Xi Jinping laid out his country's climate ambitions. While the stated goals may not have been aggressive as some environmentalists would like, Xi at least reaffirmed China's green commitment. Any reference to Donald Trump and the United States was surely intended (though not explicit). And with this approach, China has already taken quite a few steps. Today, there is no race to be a climate leader. A few months later, Russia invaded Ukraine; the ensuing energy crisis and inflation kicked climate off of many political agendas. The European Union has also stuttered: Too internally divided, it did not go beyond a drab declaration of intent at the UN Climate Summit. There hasn't been much movement from India, a country of nearly 1.5 billion people. And other nations' emissions are simply too small to matter. Given this background, it becomes easy to understand how, in this scenario, China has become a global leader in the clean energy transition. In Xi's speech you can seen China transition from a developing country approach to a role more akin to that of industrialized countries, whose emissions have been declining for decades. It should be pointed out that reducing emissions at the pace promised by Beijing means a decline of about 1 percent a year. According to an analysis by William Lamb of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, this is a slower pace than that held by most industrialized nations. Italy, for example, has reduced them by an average of 3.2 percent every 12 months since their peak in 2006; the United Kingdom by an average of 2.8 percent since 2004; France by 2.3 percent. “China has often promised little and achieved much,” notes Andreas Sieber, associate director for policy and campaigns for the global climate nonprofit 350.org, suggesting that China might overdeliver. Xi Jinping's speech included a commitment to reach 3,600 gigawatts (GW) of installed wind and solar capacity by 2035, six times the country's 2020 figures. This is already the leading country in terms of installed renewable power, and a giant on the technology front as well, with universities churning out environmental and climate tech research at full speed, and attracting scientists from abroad across numerous fields. He also announced a commitment to an energy mix with more than 30 percent renewables. Mobility has long been an issue for China, which has moved from bicycles, ubiquitous until the 1990s, to the mass automobile. The government has in recent years given a strong boost to electric mobility: At the Climate Summit it announced plans to make EVs “mainstream,” that is, prevalent in sales. China made additional commitments on forests, which it says will reach an extent of 34 billion cubic meters. To skeptics expecting broader measures and the mantle of true global leadership from China, well, that's not a particularly coveted title these days—especially if the US continues to reverse course on climate science. As senior advisor Bernice Lee of the think tank Chatham House notes, China invested $625 billion in the clean energy transition last year alone; that's nearly a third of the gobal total. Not only that: Research and massive adoption of renewable technologies have led to the dramatic drop in prices, and China's very large domestic market is a formidable driver in this regard.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Once-cheap SSDs, DRAM, and HDD prices are climbing fast as AI demand and constrained supply converge to create the tightest market in years. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. This free-to-access article was made possible by Tom's Hardware Premium, where you can find in-depth news analysis, features and access to Bench. Nearly every analyst firm and memory maker is now warning of looming shortages of NAND and DRAM that will result in skyrocketing pricing for SSDs and memory over the coming months and years, with some even predicting a shortage that will last a decade. SSD prices cratered to all-time lows in 2023, with high-performance NVMe drives selling for little more than the cost of a modest mechanical hard disk. In 2024, the pendulum swung firmly in the other direction, with prices for both NAND flash and DRAM starting to climb. From consumer SSDs and DDR4 kits to enterprise storage arrays and bulk HDD shipments, there's a singular throughline: costs are moving upward in a convergence that the market has not seen in years. The downturn of 2022 and early 2023 left memory makers in dire straits. Manufacturers responded with drastic output cuts to stem the bleeding. By the second half of 2023, those reductions had worked their way through to sales channels. NAND spot prices for 512Gb TLC parts, which had fallen to record lows, rose by more than 100% in the span of six months, and contract pricing followed. Western Digital's 2TB Black SN850X sold for upwards of $150 in early 2024, while Samsung's 990 Pro 2TB went from a holiday low of around $120 to more than $175 within the same timeframe. Forecasts for Q3 2025's PC-grade DDR4 products were set to jump by 38-43% quarter-over-quarter, with server DDR4 close behind at 28-33%. Even the graphics memory market began to strain. Vendors shifted to GDDR7 for next-generation GPUs, and shortfalls in GDDR6 sales inflated prices by around 30%. DDR5, still the mainstream ramp, rose more modestly but showed a clear upward slope. That shortage redirected some workloads toward flash, tightening NAND supply further. This time, the main driver of demand is AI. OpenAI's “Stargate” project has recently signed an agreement with Samsung and SK hynix for up to 900,000 wafers of DRAM per month. That figure alone would account for close to 40% of global DRAM output. Whether the full allocation is realized or not, the fact that such a deal even exists shows how aggressively AI firms are locking in supply at an enormous scale. High-density NAND products are effectively sold out months in advance. Samsung's next-generation V9 NAND is already nearly booked before it's even launched. Micron has presold almost all of its High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) output through 2026. Contracts that once covered a quarter now span years, with hyperscalers buying directly at the source. Raspberry Pi, which had stockpiled memory during the downturn, was forced to raise prices in October 2025 due to memory costs. Eben Upton, the company's CEO, noted that “memory costs roughly 120% more than it did a year ago,” in an official statement on the Raspberry Pi website. Seemingly, nothing and no one can escape the surge in pricing. Over the past decade, NAND and DRAM makers learned that unchecked production expansion usually leads to collapse. HBM, in particular, commands exceptional margins, making it an obvious priority. According to the CEO of Phison Electronics, Taiwan's largest NAND controller company, it's this redirection of capital expenditure that will cause tight supply for, he claims, the next decade. “NAND will face severe shortages in the next year. I think supply will be tight for the next ten years,” he said in a recent interview. First… every time flash makers invested more, prices collapsed, and they never recouped their investments… Then in 2023, Micron and SK hynix redirected huge capex into HBM because the margins were so attractive, leaving even less investment for flash.” It's these actions that are squeezing more mainstream products even tighter. Meanwhile, TLC NAND, once abundant, is also being rationed as manufacturers allocate their resources where the money is, leaving older but still essential segments undersupplied. The same story is playing out in storage. For the first time, NAND flash and HDDs are both constrained at once. Historically, when one was expensive, the other provided a release valve, but training large models involves ingesting petabytes of data, and all of it has to live somewhere. That “warm” data usually sits on nearline HDDs in data centers, but demand is now so high that lead times for top-capacity drives have stretched beyond a year. With nearline HDDs scarce, some hyperscalers are accelerating the deployment of QLC flash arrays. That solves one bottleneck, but creates another, pushing demand pressure back onto NAND supply chains. The result is a squeeze from both sides, with HDD prices rising because of supply limits and SSD prices firming as cloud buyers step in to fill the gap. Fabs are being built, but they're expensive and take a long time to get up and running, especially in the U.S. A new greenfield memory fab comes with a price tag in the tens of billions, and requires several years before volume production. Even expansions of existing lines take months of tool installation and calibration, with equipment suppliers such as ASML and Applied Materials struggling with major backlogs. If demand cools or procurement pauses after stockpiling, an overbuilt market could send prices tumbling. The scars of 2019 and 2022 are still fresh in their minds. This makes companies reluctant to bet on long-term cycles, even as AI demand looks insatiable today — after all, many believe that we're witnessing an AI bubble. Talent shortages in semiconductor engineering slow the process even further. The net result is deliberate discipline, with manufacturers choosing to sell existing supply at higher margins rather than risk another collapse. For consumers, this puts an end to ultra-cheap PC upgrades, while enterprise customers will need larger infrastructure budgets. Storage arrays, servers, and GPU clusters all require more memory at a higher cost, and many hyperscalers make their own SSDs using custom controllers from several vendors. Larger companies, like Pure Storage, procure NAND in massive quantities for all flash arrays that power AI data centers. Some hyperscalers have already adjusted by reserving supply years in advance. Smaller operators without that leverage face longer lead times and steeper bills. Consumers can delay an upgrade or accept smaller capacities, but the broader effect is to slow the adoption of high-capacity drives and larger memory footprints. Enterprises have little choice but to absorb costs, given the critical role of memory in AI and cloud workloads. The market should eventually rebalance, but it's impossible to predict when. New fabs are under construction, supported by government incentives, and if demand growth moderates or procurement pauses, the cycle could shift back toward oversupply. Until then, prices for NAND flash, DRAM, and HDDs will likely remain elevated into 2026. And the seasonal price dips we took for granted in the years gone by probably won't be returning any time soon.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump posted some new videos to Truth Social late Thursday, continuing his tradition of pushing out the most bizarre content ever distributed by a U.S. president. One of the videos was AI-generated and features OMB Director Russ Vought as the Grim Reaper… and President Trump playing a cowbell. ET, is set to a parody version of Blue Öyster Cult's 1976 hit song “Don't Fear the Reaper” and opens with a stormy rendering of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., including figures draped in long black robes. Vought was a key architect of Project 2025, the conservative plan to gut the federal government, which Trump and his allies tried to pretend wasn't actually Trump's plan during the 2024 presidential campaign. The idea is that Democrats have shut down the government because they want to give health care money to undocumented immigrants, something that's not true but has been repeated incessantly by Trump and his allies in Congress. Trump just posted an AI-generated video depicting Russ Vought as the grim reaper, set to Don't Fear the Reaper Yet this new video doesn't exactly cast Trump and his allies as the guys coming in to save the day. Honestly, Vought as the Reaper is probably a fair representation of his goals. Far-right politicians increasingly seem confused about who counts as the good guys. “We want their funding to be shut down so that the EPA can't do all of the rules against our energy industry because they have no bandwidth financially to do so. We want to put them in trauma,” Vought continued. But all of the threats that Vought has been making aren't so intimidating now. After the past nine months of Trump taking a chainsaw to the federal government (often with the help of Elon Musk and DOGE), there's a real question of how much more they can cut. There's also the question of whether Trump even knows what's being posted to his social media accounts and what kinds of unhinged AI-generated content might be next. The president posted an AI video of himself last weekend promoting something called “med beds,” a QAnon-adjacent conspiracy theory that magical beds can cure all disease but are being suppressed by the pharmaceutical industry. Another AI video from Trump on Truth Social, this time of his throwing a Trump 2028 hat onto Hakeem Jeffries' head. The video has some subtle clues that it might be AI, including just the fact that Trump wouldn't be coordinated enough to pull off tossing a hat like that, but it's going to get increasingly harder to tell what's fake in our current environment. OpenAI launched a Sora app this week that makes extremely realistic-looking AI video content. And while it's invite-only right now, the tools to make very convincing fakes are becoming more commonplace. Trump and his allies aren't serious people, even if they control all the levers of power. And a reporter asked Speaker of the House Mike Johnson about the way that his party trolls Democrats with these ridiculous videos. Fox News reporter to Mike Johnson: "How can you say 'they take no pleasure in this,' and then the next minute say, 'Oh, they're just having fun and trolling?'"

The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Association (PNWH2), a multi-state hub launched to establish a hydrogen economy, lost $1 billion of federal funding in cuts announced yesterday by the Trump administration. “Our region was awarded this Hub following an intensive national competition because we showed we had the pioneering researchers, clean energy resources, and over $5 billion in committed local investment that it would take to show that clean hydrogen can work,” Cantwell said in a statement. For the fuel to be climate friendly, the electrolysis needs to be powered with clean energy, such as solar, wind or hydroelectric dams. Hydrogen has predominantly been made by pyrolysis from sources like methane, but that fuel typically is less clean. “Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left's climate agenda is being cancelled,” said Russ Vought, director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, in a post on X. Bob Ferguson defended the regional hub and its associated benefits. “These projects will lower costs, create jobs, and reduce air pollution. We're working with the Attorney General's Office to fight this illegal action,” he said in a statement. Washington state has multiple companies developing or using hydrogen technologies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Those boxy, white, electric delivery vans you may be seeing on the streets of Seattle are being used to deliver Amazon packages. Bloomberg reported last month that Amazon is separately testing about a dozen of the vans. The pilot is reportedly aimed at exploring additional EV options for Amazon's delivery fleet, which includes vans made by Rivian. “We're committed to having 100,000 electric delivery vehicles on the road by 2030, and we regularly test various vehicle options — including a small number of Chevrolet BrightDrops in our fleet,” Amazon spokesperson Steve Kelly previously told Bloomberg. Amazon began rolling out electric delivery vans in summer 2022 as part of its Climate Pledge commitment to achieve net-zero carbon emissions across global operations by 2040. A blue-vested DSP driver behind the wheel told GeekWire he was enjoying driving the BrightDrop as he streamed his music through a large, center “infotainment” display.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. A group of researchers from the University of California, Irvine, have developed a way to use the sensors in high-quality optical mice to capture subtle vibrations and convert them into audible data. Mouse sensors with a 20,000 DPI or higher are vulnerable to this attack. Note that this compromise does not necessarily mean a complicated virus installed through a backdoor — it can be as simple as an infected FOSS that requires high-frequency mouse data, like creative apps or video games. "With only a vulnerable mouse, and a victim's computer running compromised or even benign software (in the case of a web-based attack surface), we show that it is possible to collect mouse packet data and extract audio waveforms," the researchers state. The processing works like this: the raw audio data is run through digital signal processing using a Wiener Filter, where you can start to hear some information. This is then further cleared up through a neural model, giving the researchers clear audio. Although this is a novel method for extracting audio from unsuspecting targets, it's not exactly the first time that someone has attempted to covertly record targets. However, this method is empowered by AI models, allowing the researchers to get a speech recognition accuracy of about 42 to 61%, effectively turning your mouse into an eavesdropping microphone, though. The proof of concept is certainly unnerving, but it will hopefully prompt future steps taken to prevent this sort of acoustic privacy violation, the kind that would have been unthinkable in a world before AI.

I wouldn't pretend to understand the Android app ecosystem better than Google.A charitable guess would be that Google understands that forcing developer registration will introduce more risk for some people, but overall the total risk over the entire population is reduced. It's a net benefit.
