New York Yankees' Aaron Judge talks with Toronto Blue Jays first baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. during a game in the Bronx last month.Adam Hunger/The Associated Press

When Yankees broadcaster and professional loudmouth Michael Kay ripped the Blue Jays in July, it wasn't what he said. 

What Kay said made a sort of sense – that the Jays, who were in first place, weren't a first-place team based on their run differential. Baseball nerds have this discussion all the time. 

Rather, it was the way Kay, a native New Yorker, said it. It was the sneer in his voice. 

The Yankees have never rated the Jays, because New York doesn't rate Toronto. I don't even want to think about what they'd say after a couple of beers about the rest of Canada. 

Hockey, sure. They'll defer on hockey. But baseball? What's next? Football? Are you serious?

Anybody who's followed Toronto sports for a while knows it's not worth hating New York teams, because they won't hate you back. They'd need to see you as equals for that to happen.

The nadir of this tendency was the Howie Clark incident.

Clark was a 14-year-veteran who'd yo-yo'd between the majors and the minors – mostly the minors – his whole career. He'd worked construction in the off-season to pay the rent, making him the last, honest-to-God working-class pro. He may also be the sweetest guy I've ever met in baseball. 

In Depth: The Blue Jays' year started out rocky. Now it's monumental. Here's what changed

In 2007, he caught on with the Jays for the second time. In his debut that year – a meaningless late-May encounter with the Yankees – then-New York star Alex Rodriguez decided to yank his chain. 

Jorge Posada popped a two-out pitch up in the infield. Clark settled under it. As he ran past, Rodriguez yelled something. Jays players later said it sounded like, “Mine.” Clark thought he was being called off. The ball dropped in. A run scored. 

The Yankees were already winning the game. The only purpose of Rodriguez's shout – he later said he'd yelled “Ha,” which doesn't make it any better – was to humiliate Clark. 

Had he done it to an all-star in a game that mattered, it would have still been an awful abrogation of fair play. But to do it to a guy who's just hanging on, in his first game, for no reason other than to do it?

Then-Jays manager John Gibbons got it. Gibbons was a yeller, but he rarely got genuinely angry. He was angry then. As angry as I ever saw him. He couldn't believe someone so high on the baseball ladder had done that to someone so much further down. 

That incident expressed better than any “they got a great team over there” quote how the Yankees actually felt about the Jays. That they were lesser than. 

This summer, Kay reminded everyone that things haven't changed. That's what people were reacting to.

Even his apology reeked of noblesse oblige. He made excuses, then he ripped Sportsnet broadcaster Jamie Campbell for waving a broom after Toronto swept New York.

“I love Toronto. It is a cosmopolitan city,” Kay said. “You're waving a broom on a postgame show? You're turning it into Mayberry RFD.”

(I had to look that one up. Maybe they watch a lot of TV Land in the Bronx.)

Why do all set-tos between Canadians and Americans feel like the weaponization of our national reputation for niceness? “What, you're mad? I feel terrible about that, loser.”

When things kick off on Saturday, it will be the first time the Jays have played the Yankees in the postseason. Maybe that's part of it, too. If you're feeling good about your prospects in a fight, it's hard to take your opponent seriously until they've hurt you. The Jays have never hurt the Yankees in a game that really mattered. They've nicked them up, but they've never knocked them out. 

The last time Toronto was really good – the late eighties and early nineties – the Yankees were mostly terrible. The Jays couldn't snatch from them something they weren't capable of grabbing in the first place.

Now, 50 years in, they have that chance. 

I make it a practice not to care who wins what game when, but it would be fun to watch the Jays stomp the Yankees at 161st Street. 

Gausman set to take the mound for Blue Jays' playoff opener

As the Blue Jays head to the playoffs, a new turn in our family baseball drama

I'm pretty sure that wouldn't make much of an impression. A one-off, New York would tell itself. 

Then I'd like to see Toronto do it again. And maybe one more season after that. 

This is the only bright spot to wild-card expansion. It makes it theoretically possible that right now, Toronto can break New York's (and Boston's) heart for a generation. 

It's beneath any Canadian team to want to be taken seriously in the States. Not just because it can never happen, but because it's a perversion of how rivalry works. You can only be proper rivals with the places that are most like you. 

Let's face it – Calgary is Edmonton with bigger belt buckles; Toronto is Montreal with a different accent. Hence, the great rivalries. 

When we start parsing the small differences between this place and that that we claim add up to a chasm, we're showing how close we are. That people will read this and be angry about it proves my point. 

New Yorkers don't know anything about us. They know it's cheaper up here, and that you don't go broke if you fall off a ladder and need to go to the E.R. Some blah blah about multiculturalism, and isn't this where Drake has that big, ugly house? 

New Yorkers are not our rivals. It's not romantic like that. They are our frenemies from work. We see each other every now and again, and they never remember our name. 

We go to them, but they never bother coming to us. That's fine. Not everyone is meant to be your best pal. 

But you draw the line at a lack of respect. There's no call for that sort of thing. You don't earn respect from someone who's not willing to give it. You take it from them. In this case, you do that one baseball humiliation at a time.

US treasurer says officials looking at drafts for country's 250th anniversary featuring president with raised fist

To commemorate the 250th anniversary of the US's independence, the treasury department is mulling production of a $1 coin displaying Donald Trump with a clenched first under an American flag and the words “fight, fight, fight”.

The words overtly reference what Trump said immediately after narrowly surviving an assassination attempt four months before he won a second presidency.

US treasurer Brandon Beach effectively announced a draft design of the coin Friday on X, saying: “No fake news here. These drafts honoring America's 250th birthday and [Trump] are real.”

The X post – which boosted another account commenting on the draft design – said Beach looked “forward to sharing more” after the end of the partial government shutdown that began after midnight Wednesday when Senate Democrats demanding concessions on healthcare and other spending priorities refused to provide the votes necessary to pass a Republican-backed funding bill.

As Politico pointed out, in 2020, at the end of his first presidency, Trump signed bipartisan legislation authorizing the treasury secretary to issue $1 coins during the calendar year 2026 that are “emblematic of the United States semiquincentennial”.

One side of the coin on whose draft design Beach commented Friday showed Trump's profile alongside “Liberty”, “In God we Trust”, and “1776-2026”.

The other side referenced the attempt on Trump's life at a political rally in Pennsylvania last year, when authorities said a sniper injured Trump's right ear and wounded two others before being shot to death by the US Secret Service.

Trump raised his fist after the attack – one of two attempted assassinations for him as he successfully ran for a second Oval Office term in 2024 – and shouted, “Fight! Fight! Fight!” with an American flag looming nearby.

A statement from a treasury department spokesperson to Politico said the draft which Beach's X post discussed was not the “final $1 coin design”. But the statement maintained that “this draft reflects well the enduring spirit of our country and democracy, even in the face of immense obstacles”.

Trump's approval rating on average has plummeted to -9.5%, as his second administration has cut healthcare protections and nutrition assistance that benefits the poor – while also implementing tariffs that preceded a reported rise in consumer prices.

A poll of 3,445 US adults taken by Pew Research between 22 and 28 September showed 53% believed Trump had made the national economy worse. Only 24% believed that he's improved the economy, according to the poll's finding.

Among other things, the Trump administration has also deployed US military troops into the streets of multiple cities, axed roughly half a billion dollars in funding for vaccines such as the ones that helped end the Covid pandemic, and struggled to contain a scandal over his past friendship with late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

WASHINGTON—Gaza-based terrorist group Hamas said Friday it has agreed to release all hostages in accordance with U.S. President Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan.

The group also said it has accepted parts of the peace proposal to end its war with Israel, including giving up power over Gaza, but noted that other provisions would require further consultations among Palestinians.

Palestinian militant group accepts part of US president's plan but seeks further negotiations on many terms

Donald Trump ordered Israel to “immediately” stop bombing Gaza as he welcomed Hamas's partial acceptance of his ultimatum to end the nearly two-year war.

Hamas has agreed to release all hostages in return for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, as well as surrender governing power in the Gaza Strip, in accordance with Trump's plan.

In a statement on Friday evening, the Palestinian militant group asked for further negotiations on other parts of the plan, and did not say whether it would lay down its arms – a key part of Trump's proposal unveiled on Monday.

Despite the qualified response by Hamas, Trump said in a post on Truth Social: “Based on the Statement just issued by Hamas, I believe they are ready for a lasting PEACE.

“Israel must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the Hostages out safely and quickly! Right now, it's far too dangerous to do that.

“We are already in discussions on details to be worked out. This is not about Gaza alone, this is about long sought PEACE in the Middle East.”

In a brief video message posted separately Trump said it was a “very special day” and added that “Everybody will be treated fairly.”

The unprecedented order from Trump underlined that Israel and Hamas are the closest they have been in two years to achieving an end to the war in Gaza.

After the Hamas response, the office of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, issued a statement cited by local media saying Israel was preparing for an “immediate implementation” of the first stage of the plan for the immediate release of all hostages.

“We will continue to work in full cooperation with the president and his team to end the war in accordance with the principles laid out by Israel, which correspond with Trump's vision for ending the war,” the statement said, making no mention of Trump's demand that Israel stop bombing Gaza.

Trump is widely seen as the only international leader with the power to compel Netanyahu to agree to a ceasefire deal.

According to residents, Israeli tanks bombarded Talateeni Street, a major artery in the heart of Gaza City, after Trump's message to Israel to stop.

Witnesses said Israeli military planes also intensified bombing in Gaza City in the hour after Hamas issued its statement, hitting several houses in the Remal neighbuorhood.

There were also strikes on Khan Younis but no reports of casualties, residents said.

An AFP journalist in the Gaza Strip's coastal area of Al-Mawasi said they heard celebratory cries of “Allahu Akbar!” (God is the greatest) rise from tents housing Palestinians as news of Hamas's response filtered through.

“The moment I read the news … my body trembled and shivered. A feeling came over me, like, ‘Oh Allah, at last relief has come to us',” Samah Al-Hu, a displaced Palestinian in Al-Mawasi, said.

In a statement earlier on Friday night, Hamas said it was giving its “approval of releasing all occupation prisoners – both living and remains – according to the exchange formula contained in president Trump's proposal, with the necessary field conditions for implementing the exchange”.

Hamas also said it was prepared to turn over “the administration of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian body of independent technocrats based on Palestinian national consensus and supported by Arab and Islamic backing”.

However, the group said “other issues” in Trump's proposal would need to be discussed further “within a unified Palestinian national framework”. The unspecified issues would likely include arms, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and international guarantees for a permanent ceasefire.

A senior Hamas official told Al Jazeera that the group would not disarm before Israel's occupation of the enclave ends, comments that underscored the gap between the parties.

Trump's plan called for an immediate end to fighting in Gaza, an exchange of hostages and Palestinian prisoners within 72 hours of the deal's signing, a gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, the disarmament of Hamas and a transitional authority led by Trump.

The deal also stipulated a surge of aid to Gaza, parts of which are experiencing famine, and the reconstruction to the mostly demolished strip.

The deal was largely seen as unfavourable to Hamas and, if agreed in full, would likely spell the group's end as an armed Palestinian faction while demanding few concessions from Israel. International pressure on the group to accept the plan has been intense, with most regional and international powers welcoming the Trump initiative.

The catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza, with Israel's continued aid blockade and daily bombing, also puts pressure on the group to reach an agreement to end the war.

Though Hamas did not immediately agree to disarm, its acceptance of a hostage handover will be seen as significant. The 48 hostages have been used as leverage throughout the nearly two-year war. Giving them up would we leave the group with few bargaining chips going forward.

Israel's war in Gaza has killed at least 66,288 Palestinians and wounded about 170,000, according to the Gaza health authority, mainly civilians. The figure does not include the thousands buried under the rubble or those killed by indirect consequences of the war.

A UN commission of inquiry and many human rights experts have concluded that Israel has committed genocide in Gaza. Netanyahu's government claims it has acted in self-defence.

The war was launched by Israel in response to Hamas-led militants killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages in Israel on 7 October 2023.

The Qatari ministry of foreign affairs also welcomed Hamas's response, and said it had begun working with fellow mediator Egypt to coordinate with the US on negotiations towards ending the war in Gaza.

A spokesman for the UN secretary general, António Guterres, said he “urges all parties to seize the opportunity to bring the tragic conflict in Gaza to an end”, while the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, called for the Trump plan to be implemented “without delay”, saying Hamas's acceptance of it was “a significant step forwards”.

The French president, Emmanuel Macron, wrote on social media that “the release of all hostages and a ceasefire in Gaza are within reach!”, and the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said that “after almost two years, this is the best chance for peace”.

Trump has shared vitriolic and racist social media posts targeting Democratic leaders during the government shutdown.

On Thursday, President Donald Trump shared a meme on Truth Social claiming that the Democratic Party is the party of  “Satan.”

The post featured images of prominent Democratic members of Congress, including Sen. Chuck Schumer (New York), Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (New York), Rep. Nancy Pelosi (California), and others. Superimposed on the images are the words “THE PARTY OF HATE, EVIL, AND SATAN.”

The post also included the words, “The Democratic Party is Dead!” and “Their only message for America is to hate Trump!”

The social media post comes as tensions between Republicans and Democrats in Congress are high, with the parties currently negotiating a continuing resolution bill to end the government shutdown. Democrats are demanding that the bill restore funding for programs ensuring that low-income Americans and those who receive tax credits for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) can continue having access to health care.

Trump has made several other posts attacking Democrats during the shutdown. One such post featured a racist video, made with AI technology, of House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) wearing a sombrero and donning a fake mustache — a reference to the false, race-baiting Republican talking point that Democrats are keeping the government shut down to force legislation that would allow undocumented immigrants to access federal health funds and programs. 

Trump's posts come just weeks after he and several other GOP voices demanded that Democrats tone down their supposedly hateful rhetoric in the wake of Charlie Kirk's murder. Trump — who has frequently peddled violent rhetoric and incited violence against against his political opponents — has used the killing to escalate his crackdown on dissent and people with left-leaning viewpoints, with him and his allies baselessly alleging that the “radical left” is “directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today.”

Indeed, Trump signed an executive order last month designating “antifa” as a domestic terrorist organization, despite lacking the legal framework to do so. And last week, he told U.S. military generals to prepare to target “the enemy within,” a term he's previously used to refer to progressives and people with left-leaning views. 

Meanwhile, studies have repeatedly showcased that the vast majority of politically motivated violence in the U.S. involves people with right-wing views. One such study, conducted by authors at The Conversation, demonstrated that “Right-wing extremist violence has been deadlier than left-wing violence in recent years.”

“Based on government and independent analyses, right-wing extremist violence has been responsible for the overwhelming majority of fatalities, amounting to approximately 75 percent to 80 percent of U.S. domestic terrorism deaths since 2001,” the study's authors wrote.

Human rights organizations have condemned Mario Guevara's deportation as an authoritarian attack on the free press.

Emmy award-winning journalist Mario Guevara was deported today to El Salvador – a country he fled over 20 years ago — in retaliation for filming law enforcement activities, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ.)

On Tuesday, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals denied an emergency request to temporarily block the Board of Immigration Appeals' order to deport Guevara. The three judges on the immigration appeals board were all appointed by Attorney General Pam Bondi under President Donald Trump.

“Mario and his family are being punished for his reporting,” the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said in a post on BlueSky. “This cruelty is meant to stifle our free press.”

“Words cannot begin to describe the loss and devastation my family feels,” said Mario's son, Oscar, in a statement released on Thursday. “I am in utter shock and disbelief the government has punished my father for simply doing his life's work of journalism.”

“He is the reason our home feels like home,” he continued. 

Oscar said after he was diagnosed with a brain tumor, “it was my dad who centered me, who drove me to my medical appointments, and who lifted me up.” 

In 2004, Guevara came to the United States from El Salvador to escape persecution for his journalism. He settled in Georgia and continued his work as a reporter. Over the course of his career in the United States, he won numerous awards, including an Emmy, and was named one of the 50 Most Influential Latinos in Georgia. In 2019, his reporting was the subject of a New York Times documentary, and in 2024, he founded his own news organization, MGNews. 

In June, officers arrested him while he was reporting at a “No Kings” protest against Trump, even though he was wearing a vest with “PRESS” written on the front and back. Guevara was taken to the local jail and then placed in ICE custody. All charges were dropped, but the government fought to deport him, arguing that he was a danger to the community based on his livestreams and videos of law enforcement activities. 

“I was following them,” Guevara told the Altanta-Journal Constitution in a phone interview published in July. “I was showing their faces when they were arresting immigrants.”

He said that during his detention, officers have said to him, “You gave me a hard time, Mario. Hey, remember me?”

Over the course of his more than 100 days of imprisonment, he has been subjected to prolonged solitary confinement, confined to his cell for 22 hours a day, according to the ACLU.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) previously told Truthout in an email that Guevara was in custody because he entered the country illegally in 2004, which is false. Guevara came to the U.S. on a B1 visa, is authorized to work in the United States, and has a social security number. He is also eligible for a green card.

Local lawmakers, human rights groups, and press freedom organizations condemned Guevara's detention and called for his immediate release. On Tuesday, more than a hundred scholars, journalists, and writers sent a letter to DHS and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to demand his release. Signatories included Art Spiegelman, Arundhati Roy, David Remnick, Ibram X. Kendi, Jelani Cobb, John Cusack, Judith Butler, Judy Blume, and Julianne Moore.

In response to the news that Guevara would be deported on Friday, Seth Stern, director of advocacy for the Freedom of the Press Foundation, said in a statement that Guevara was “ripped from his family and community because the Trump administration punishes journalists to protect its own power.”

“The only thing that journalists like Guevara threaten is the government's chokehold on information it doesn't want the public to know,” he continued. 

Amnesty International USA's Executive Director Paul O'Brien said in a statement that deporting Guevara “sends a chilling and dangerous message: that journalists can be detained, silenced, and deported simply for doing their jobs.” 

“The already cruel immigration system is being used as a testing ground for widespread authoritarian practices under Trump, and now, with the deportation of Mario Guevara, it is being weaponized to silence a journalist,” he continued.

Last month, Guevara penned an essay about his imprisonment.

“I have to remain strong and confident that the United States still has some caring and decency left and that in the end justice will prevail,” he wrote.

“Hopefully, soon all my tears and my family's tears will be wiped away, and we can have fun and smile, triumphant, as we did before, together and in absolute freedom.”

Pentagon chief says strike – fourth by US military in recent weeks – targeted boat with ‘substantial amounts' of drugs

The United States carried out a strike against an alleged drug-trafficking boat on Friday that killed four people, US defense secretary Pete Hegseth said, a day after the Trump administration told Congress it was entering a new “non-international armed conflict” with cartels.

The strike, which Hegseth said he directed on Donald Trump's orders, appears to be at least the fourth in recent weeks. Hegseth gave few details about the boat or the evidence that it was carrying narcotics, other than saying the US had confirmed it was carrying drugs.

“The strike was conducted in international waters just off the coast of Venezuela while the vessel was transporting substantial amounts of narcotics – headed to America to poison our people,” Hegseth said on X.

“Our intelligence, without a doubt, confirmed that this vessel was trafficking narcotics, the people onboard were narco-terrorists, and they were operating on a known narco-trafficking transit route,” Hegseth said.

The latest attack on a boat comes as the Trump administration provided a notification on the issue to Congress in the form of a memo that attempted to legally justify the increasingly expansive use of military force against alleged Venezuelan drug boats.

The notification was provided by senior Pentagon officials as part of an attempt to explain the Trump administration's legal arguments for the strikes. It also included a classified briefing to members of the Senate armed services committee that took place on Wednesday.

Hegseth's post claimed the boat was “affiliated with Designated Terrorist Organizations”, a term the administration introduced for the first time in a confidential memo sent to Congress that attempted to legally justify the strikes. The Guardian reviewed a copy of the memo.

Until this week, the administration has referred to Tren de Aragua and other cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, or FTO. Legal experts suggested that simply characterizing drugs cartels as an FTO did not give the administration any additional authority to use lethal force.

White House officials have sought to justify the strikes internally and externally by claiming Trump was exercising his article II powers, which allows the president to use military force in self-defense in limited engagements.

The self-defense argument revolves around Trump's designation of Tren de Aragua as a foreign terrorist organization, a claim advanced by Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff, in order to defend the deportations of dozens of Venezuelans earlier this year under the Alien Enemies Act.

The administration claimed that Tren de Aragua had infiltrated the regime of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro – and so the presence of the cartel's members in the US amounted to a “predatory incursion” by a foreign nation, allowing for the deportation of any Venezuelan national.

But the administration has yet to provide concrete evidence that Tren de Aragua has become an instrument of the Venezuelan government, and legal experts contacted for this story said the White House could only justify the strikes if it could make that showing.

The strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug boats have largely been overseen by Miller and Tony Salisbury, his top lieutenant at the White House homeland security council (HSC), the Guardian has previously reported.

Miller empowered the HSC earlier this year to become its own entity in Donald Trump's second term, a notable departure from previous administrations where it was considered part of the national security council and ultimately reported to the national security adviser.

That was the case, for instance, with the second Venezuelan boat hit with hellfire missiles on 15 September. While the White House was informed the Pentagon had identified the boat as a viable target more than four days before, many top White House officials only learned of the impending strike hours before it happened.

The previous strikes trikes on three boats in the Caribbean have killed 17 people and triggered widespread international outrage. Hegseth added in his social media post: “These strikes will continue until the attacks on the American people are over!!!!”

Editor's note: This story was update to include a comment made by French President Emmanuel Macron.

French reporter and photographer Antoni Lallican was killed and Ukrainian photographer Heorhii Ivanchenko was injured in a Russian drone strike, Ukraine's 4th Separate Mechanized Brigade said on Oct. 3.

The brigade said that the journalists had come under a targeted attack with a Russian first-person-view (FPV) drone. 

Ivanchenko, a Ukrainian photojournalist and member of the Ukrainian Association of Professional Photographers, was wounded. His condition is stable, according to the brigade. 

Both men were wearing protective gear marked "Press," the brigade said, condemning the strike as a violation of international humanitarian law.

According to Reporters Without Borders (RSF), Russian forces have killed at least 13 journalists and injured nearly 50 since the start of the full-scale invasion as of February 2025. RSF, together with the Institute of Mass Information, has documented nearly 150 cases of journalists targeted by Russian abuses while carrying out their work.

The Ukrainian Association of Professional Photographers said Ivanchenko had underwent surgery after being "seriously wounded." 

"We bow our heads in memory of Antoni and hope for the fastest possible recovery of Heorhii," the group said in a statement.

Ivanchenko had previously worked with the Kyiv Independent as a freelance photographer.

Lallican, a Paris-based photojournalist, covered social and humanitarian issues in conflict zones around the world. He first arrived in Ukraine in March 2022, shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion, and since then had documented the impact of the war, particularly in Donetsk Oblast.

The brigade expressed condolences to Lallican's family and colleagues and said the attack was further proof of the "cynicism and brutality" of Russia's army.

French President Emmanuel Macron also reacted to the death of Lallican, saying he "learned with deep sadness of his death, a victim of a Russian drone attack."

"I extend my heartfelt condolences to his family, his loved ones, as well as to all his colleagues who, at the peril of their lives, inform us and bear witness to the reality of the war," Macron wrote on X. 

With the accelerated use of drones by Russian forces, short-range drones have become one of the deadliest threats to both civilians in front-line areas and the Ukrainian military on the battlefield.

Authorities at Munich International Airport ordered a suspension in flight operations shortly after 9:30 p.m. local time after multiple drones were spotted in the vicinity of the airport for the second time in less than 24 hours.

A Russian drone strike on a pig farm in Kharkiv Oblast killed approximately 13,000 pigs on Oct. 3, Ukraine's State Emergency Service (SES) reported.

Ukraine's Special Operations Forces said that its drones struck a P-14F "Lena" long-range detection radar system as well as a "Sopka-2" en route radar complex in Russia's Voronezh Oblast.



Both men were wearing protective gear marked "Press," Ukraine's 4th Separate Mechanized Brigade said, condemning the strike as a violation of international humanitarian law.

"Just today, Russia struck our gas infrastructure with 35 missiles, including ballistic weapons. It was a combined strike, and only half of the missiles were shot down," Zelensky said after a meeting with Ukraine's top military command. 

"Ukraine is a country with a very difficult fate. Why should we share in this difficult fate? We have our own fate, which is much easier than that of the Ukrainians," Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said in an interview.



The 59th Brigade of the Unmanned Systems Forces destroyed the Russian helicopter near the village of Kotliarivka, in Donetsk Oblast.



According to investigators, the suspect monitored Andriy Parubiy's daily routine and movements while preparing an escape plan abroad. Law enforcement officers detained him before he could leave Ukraine.

The disruption has stalled meetings between Ukrainian officials and U.S. counterparts from the Pentagon, State Department, and White House, according to the Telegraph.



The ship was intercepted by the French Navy on Sept. 28 and diverted to the coast of Western France while investigations continue.

The three men — Captain Davit Vadatchkor and assistant captains Robert Egizaryan and Santosh Kumar Chaurasia — had been accused of damaging undersea cables in the Baltic Sea.

            The US military carried out another strike on a boat operating in the Caribbean officials deemed to be a “narco-trafficking vessel” on Friday morning, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced in a social media post. The strike killed all four people who were on board, Hegseth said.
    


            The attack marks at least the fourth known US military strike in the Caribbean since the beginning of September, all of which have targeted boats the administration claims are “affiliated” with drug cartels that the US has designated as terrorist organizations in recent months.
    


            Hegseth posted on X on Friday that at President Trump's order, he directed the “lethal, kinetic strike on a narco-trafficking vessel affiliated with Designated Terrorist Organizations in the USSOUTHCOM area of responsibility.”
    


            The attack took place in international waters just off Venezuela's coast, Hegseth wrote — a move that could further inflame tensions between the US and the Venezuelan regime. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro said on Tuesday that he is preparing to declare a state of emergency to protect his country in the event of an attack by the US military.
    


            Hegseth did not say which terrorist organization the boat was allegedly affiliated with, but added that “our intelligence, without a doubt, confirmed that this vessel was trafficking narcotics, the people onboard were narco-terrorists, and they were operating on a known narco-trafficking transit route.” He alleged the boat was “transporting substantial amounts of narcotics - headed to America to poison our people.”
    


            The administration has previously argued that other boats it has struck were also headed to the US, necessitating urgent military action. However, at least one boat struck by the US military last month had turned around before it was hit, CNN has reported, indicating it did not pose an imminent threat to the US or US forces. Following the US' first such strike on September 2, Secretary of State Marco Rubio initially said that the boat had likely been headed toward Trinidad or elsewhere in the Caribbean.
    


            Legal experts and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have questioned the legality of the strikes.
    


            “They're throwing a lot of words out there that don't necessarily go together or constitute a coherent legal justification,” Brian Finucane, a former State Department lawyer who specializes in war powers issues, previously told CNN.
    


In a letter to Congress this week, the Pentagon said Trump had determined that the US is in an “armed conflict” with the drug cartels his administration has designated as terrorist organizations, and that smugglers for the cartels are “unlawful combatants,” CNN has reported.
    


            Describing the US military strikes as part of an armed conflict suggests that the attacks are part of a longer-term campaign and not just one-off strikes in self-defense. In his post on X on Friday, Hegseth said “these strikes will continue until the attacks on the American people are over!!!”

Indigenous protesters have been demonstrating and shutting down highways since Noboa lifted Ecuador's diesel subsidies.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

The video is shocking. The footage is low quality, shot from above and behind the scene: A group of people run from state security forces up an empty highway at full speed. Four people are carrying a limp body. But under the fire of gunshots, tear gas and police sirens, three of the people drop the body and flee. The other man, in a blue jacket, kneels beside the body, and holds onto him.

Two armored vehicles arrive, lights flashing. Two men in green fatigues, helmets and body gear jump out. They point their weapons, and begin to kick and beat the two men on the ground — one alive, though he would end up unconscious and hospitalized, one already dead. The latter's name was Efraín Fuerez. He was a 46-year-old Indigenous Kichwa community member from Cotacachi, Ecuador, and the father of two children.

Reports say Ecuadorian armed forces shot Fuerez three times with live ammunition the morning of September 28 on the Pan-American Highway close to the town of Ilumán. There is no video of the shooting itself, which took place immediately before these images.

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

Fuerez was the first to be killed by state forces after a week of widespread protests, led by Ecuador's largest Indigenous movement, the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE), against President Daniel Noboa's austerity measures.

“Justice is what I want for my husband's life,” Fuerez's wife told a local media outlet. “He wasn't a terrorist or someone bad. He was a hard worker. All I ask for is justice, for my husband and all of the people who are detained.”

“The police and military, using lethal weapons and ammunition, are shooting to kill against our communities as we exercise our legitimate right to social protest,” CONAIE posted on social media. “Efraín's death was a direct execution in the midst of the repression … This act constitutes a very serious violation of human rights.”

CONAIE had announced an “immediate and indefinite national strike” on September 18 in response to Noboa's lifting of diesel subsidies that sent gas prices skyrocketing by nearly 60 percent. Protests have since rippled across the country.

Noboa is the 37-year-old millionaire son of a banana tycoon. He's one of President Donald Trump's top three allies in Latin America, alongside El Salvador's strongman Nayib Bukele and Argentina's libertarian leader Javier Milei.

Noboa was reelected in April in a controversial election marred by disinformation and accusations of fraud and vote buying.

Noboa had previously promised not to touch gas or diesel subsidies. He repeated this in numerous interviews in previous years, and in the lead up to April's election. Recently, however, he said he changed his mind because the measure wouldn't impact inflation.

“We have inflation pretty well controlled,” he said during an interview with the news outlet Ecuavisa. “Eliminating this subsidy, which is more than a billion dollars a year, with the current situation, won't impact inflation very much.”

Noboa's spokesperson Carolina Jaramillo said lifting the diesel subsidy will save the Ecuadorian government $1.1 billion a year, which the government will use to provide financial social support for vulnerable sectors of society.

But community leaders say it has nothing to do with helping needy communities and everything to do with fulfilling Noboa's commitments to the structural adjustment policies prescribed by the International Monetary Fund. The international organization agreed to increase its financial support to Ecuador in June.

“This government is committed to the International Monetary Fund and its classic neoliberal agenda of eliminating subsidies, raising taxes and raising fuel prices, privatizing education, health care, and social security,” Ecuadorian human rights defender Alexis Ponce told Truthout. 

This is not the first time that shock doctrine policies like this have sparked an uprising among Ecuador's Indigenous and social movements.

In 2019, Indigenous-led protests rattled the country after conservative President Lenin Moreno rolled out austerity measures and also tried to lift the fuel subsidy.

Indigenous communities again shut down the country in June 2022 after neoliberal financial policies from right-wing businessman and president Guillermo Lasso led to rising food and fuel prices. Nine people were killed during the protests, which was considered Ecuador's largest general strike in recent memory.

Protests have now been ongoing for nearly two weeks. In addition to demonstrations and road blocks, marches have poured down highways, with protesters waving banners and carrying Ecuadorian flags. They've shut down major highways, in particular in the highland province of Imbabura, near the Indigenous town of Otavalo and Llumán, where Efraín Fuerez was killed.

The actions have seemed to gain strength.

One cell phone video sent to Truthout by a human rights observer shows dozens of members of the Zumbahua community in the province of Cotopaxi pushing boulders and rocks onto a highway as people shout, “Long live the strike!”

“Right now, we are shutting down the Latacunga-La Maná road,” says a voice off camera. “The people here are really pissed off. We aren't going to allow anyone through. Not to get to the coast or the mountains. No one is paid or forced to be here. The people are just indignant with what's happened in provinces around the country.”

Videos shared widely over social media show state security forces in helmets and riot gear firing tear gas and rubber bullets into protests and communities.

One map posted on X by the Ecuador Critical Geography Collective identified, as of September 30, 55 acts of documented repression and 16 cases of intimidation carried out by state security. The collective also documented 66 cases of what it calls “financial harassment,” with the bank accounts of human rights defenders and leaders of the movement frozen without explanation.

On October 1, the Ecuadorian Alliance for Human Rights reported 165 instances of human rights violations, with 100 people injured.

As of September 26 — the last time Ecuador's Ministry of Interior updated the public about the strike — nearly 100 people had been arrested. Thirteen have been charged with terrorism.

“Compared to previous protests, Noboa has employed a much more hardline, ‘mano dura' [‘iron fist'] approach to repression,” Pedro Labayen Herrera, a researcher with the U.S.-based Center for Economic and Policy Research, told Truthout. “The military was already in the streets as part of an unending series of states of emergency and his declaration of an ‘internal armed conflict' in January 2024, but he has also sought to link the protesters with ‘narcoterrorists,' criminals, and illegal mining.”

CONAIE released a powerful video over social media on September 27 in response to the terror charges. Members of the movement stand in the street and look into the camera.

“I'm a farmer, not a terrorist,” says an older man in the video.

“We are campesinos, not terrorists,” says a woman in traditional dress.

“I am a businessman, not a terrorist,” says someone in a white and grey wool poncho.

“Without a doubt the government is using the state of exception and the fight against organized crime to shield itself from the protests,” Billy Navarrete, the executive director of Ecuador's Permanent Committee for the Defense of Human Rights, told Truthout. “The national government is instrumentalizing criminal violence to repress protesters who are demanding better living conditions and human rights.”

Ahead of the national strike, Noboa expanded the state of emergency (also described as a state of exception) that already applied to most of the country. In January 2024, Noboa issued his first state of emergency, suspending certain constitutional rights in order to battle what he called an “internal armed conflict” against drug gangs in the country. His new decree limited crowds in public spaces throughout seven provinces, among other things.

“This situation requires exceptional intervention by state institutions to safeguard security and guarantee citizens' rights, public order, and social peace,” his decree stated.

Noboa has also temporarily moved the seat of his government to the city of Latacunga — 100 kilometers south of the capital Quito.

“While this may seem counterproductive — since Latacunga is in a region that is a stronghold of the Indigenous movement with a long tradition of demonstrations — Noboa intends it as a show of force and resolve,” said Labayen Herrera. “At the same time, the move seeks to divert the attention of protesters and organizers away from the capital, Quito, which was the site of major and decisive demonstrations in 2019 and 2022.”

Ecuador's Indigenous movement is in a peculiar moment. In a hotly contested vote amongst the organization's leadership, Marlon Vargas was elected to be the group's new president in July. He was sworn in a large ceremony in the town of Puyo, in the Amazonian province of Pastaza, where he's from.

Hundreds of Indigenous peoples from across the country's 14 different Indigenous groups packed into the city's sports stadium. 

Shamans laid out altars, lit incense, held ceremonies, and said prayers for the organization's new leadership. Indigenous leaders from across the country spoke in support of the new leadership. Many wished it well, and also demanded that the organization continue to stand up, when necessary, to defend their territories and their rights.

Some analysts had expressed doubts over Vargas's ability to respond to the Noboa government, which has been moving to expand fossil fuel extraction and mining on Indigenous lands. But in his first speech following his inauguration, Vargas hit back hard.

“During my term at the head of CONAIE, it will have a clear and firm line: Confront all threats to our territories, extractivism, large-scale mining, the expansion of oil production, and any project that threatens life,” he told the packed crowd in the auditorium, in Spanish. “I will not surrender to any government or economic power. I am a man of dialogue with dignity. When dialogue is necessary, it will be done publicly and transparently. When we must rise up, we will do so with the strength that the unity and legitimacy of our struggles give us.”

Truthout spoke with numerous members of the organization who traveled to the event from around Ecuador. They expressed faith in the new leadership. Many wore traditional Indigenous dress. 

Jairo Gualinga, a member of the Kichwa Sarayaku community in the Northern Amazonian province of Sucumbíos, wore a feather headdress and necklace of beads.

“I have known [Marlon Vargas] because we have worked together in moments of resistance, and I am sure that he can guide this organization in the way that the people have asked for,” Gualinga told Truthout. “And I am sure that he will be successful in maintaining and organizing our people for the good of the future of the Indigenous movement.”

Under Vargas' leadership, CONAIE appears to be coalescing around the strike. The group has also created an internal commission of former presidents of the organization in order to help guide their strategy forward. Among them, is Leónidas Iza, who lost to the vote to Vargas earlier this year.

Noboa has promised not to back down. So have the country's Indigenous social movements.

Analysts predict that both the protests and the repression will intensify, carrying the country down a road everyone has seen before.

“We are once again on the same path,” said Navarrete. “We have to consider that the Indigenous protest is not going to stop, and the government has to look for dialogue to avoid more misfortunes in relation to deaths, in relation to injured people, and in relation to people unfairly deprived of freedom.”

But until Noboa backs down and reinstates the diesel subsidy, Indigenous movements have promised to stay on the streets.

“Thanks to the mobilizations like this, we've been able to hold on to our territories,” Hugo Guatatoca, a young Indigenous communications student from the Amazonian region of Pastaza, told Truthout. “And right now, we are fighting against government measures that can harm our community. They say higher diesel prices won't affect other people, but it really will have an impact, with increased food prices and bus fares. And this is all harming us right now.”

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

A climbing influencer fell to his death while livestreaming himself scaling an enormous sheer rock face in California.

Balin Miller, 23, became the third person to be killed in Yosemite National Park this summer.

Fans had watched him climb on a TikTok livestream for two days before his death.

One viewer wrote: “He made it to the summit but he had to retrieve his bags as they got stuck on a rock as he was hoisting them up. As he was trying to retrieve the bags he fell to his death, all caught on the livestream.”

Yosemite National Park's El Capitan is one of the most striking features of the park, an enormous sheer granite rock face of approximately 3,000ft (915 metres) that entices big-wall rock climbers from all over the world. Alex Honnold completed the first free solo climb of El Capitan in 2017 for the documentary “Free Solo”.

Paying tribute to her son, Miller's mother Jeanine Girard-Moorman said: “He's been climbing since he was a young boy. His heart and soul was truly to just climb. He loved to climb and it was never about money and fame.”

Earlier this year, an 18-year-old from Texas died in the park while free-soloing, or climbing without a rope, on a different formation. In August, a 29-year-old woman died after being struck in the head by a large tree branch while hiking.

Miller died on the first day of the US government shutdown, under which national parks remained “generally” open but with limited operations and closed visitors centres.

The park service said it was investigating the incident and “park rangers and emergency personnel responded immediately”.

While it is still unclear exactly what happened, his older brother, Dylan Miller, said Balin was lead rope soloing (a way to climb alone while still protected by a rope) on a 2,400ft (730-metre) route named Sea of Dreams.

He had already finished the climb and was hauling up his last bit of gear when he likely rappelled off the end of his rope, Mr Miller said.

Miller was an accomplished alpinist who gained international attention for accomplishing the first solo ascent of Mount McKinley's Slovak Direct, a technically difficult route that took 56 hours to complete, he posted on his Instagram in June.

He grew up climbing in Alaska with his brother and their father, who was also a climber. “He said he felt most alive when he was climbing,” Mr Miller said. “I'm his bigger brother but he was my mentor.”

Miller spent weeks solo climbing in Patagonia and the Canadian Rockies this year, ticking off a notoriously difficult ice climb called Reality Bath, which had been unrepeated for 37 years, according to Climbing magazine.

“He's had probably one of the most impressive last six months of climbing of anyone that I can think of,” Clint Helander, an Alaska alpinist, told the Anchorage Daily News.

But this most recent trip to Yosemite was not supposed to be hard climbing. Miller had arrived two weeks early to climb before the rest of his family, who planned to meet up there.

More than just a climber, he loved animals and was fun, kind and full of life, his mother said.

“He has inspired so many people to do things that are perhaps unthinkable, including myself. I can't imagine climbing ever again without him,” his brother said.

Tens of thousands of students walked out of classrooms in cities and towns across Spain on Thursday to protest Israel's ongoing US-backed genocide in Gaza and abduction of Global Sumud Flotilla members, dozens of whom are Spanish.

The National Students' Union organized Thursday's protests under the slogan “stop the genocide against the Palestinian people.” Demonstrations, which took part in at least 39 cities and towns, varied in size from small groups to thousands who turned out in Barcelona and the capital Madrid, where students held banners with messages like “Stop Everything to Stop the Genocide,” “All Eyes on the Global Sumud Flotilla,” and “Free Palestine!”

“We're not going to look the other way,” the union said in a statement. “The Palestinian cause is the cause of the youth and the millions who stand for human rights and social justice. That is why… we called the general student strike to empty the classrooms and fill the streets with dignity.”

Maria, a Spanish student interviewed by Turkey's Anadolu Ajansı in Madrid, said: “While young people like us are being killed and subjected to genocide in Palestine, we cannot be in class. The whole world must do everything it can to stop this genocide.”

Another Madrid protester, Francesca — an Italian student studying in Spain — told Anadolu that “we must pressure governments to stop Israel.”

“Allowing genocide in full view of the world is unacceptable,” she added. “The killing of women, children, and students in Palestine must end.”

In Barcelona — whose former leftist Mayor Ada Colau was among the dozens of Spaniards who set sail for Gaza from the port city — an estimated 6,500 students and others took to the streets Thursday.

“What I can do is be here, with my presence,” student Donia Armani told El País. “The more people, the better; so the Palestinians will not be alone.”

Armani's mother added, “The Palestinians are like a brotherly people, we feel a lot from the absurd images we see.”

Ana, a 14-year-old student protesting in Barcelona, said: “I think it's very bad what's happening,” adding that Israel does “not let food arrive and also bombs them, which causes many, especially small children, to die, and I am very sorry.”

Thursday's walkouts took place as Israeli forces continued assaulting Gaza on Thursday, killing scores of Palestinians amid a backdrop of ongoing famine and forced displacement. Since October 2023, Israeli forces have killed at least 66,225 Palestinians in Gaza, although experts say the actual death toll is much higher. At least 168,938 other Palestinians have been wounded, and thousands more are missing and presumed dead.

Spain's socialist-led government has been a leading critic of Israel's genocide in Gaza, taking numerous proactive steps including cutting off arms transfers to the erstwhile ally, prohibiting the shipment of fuel to the Israeli military, formally recognizing Palestinian statehood, and backing South Africa's genocide case currently before the International Court of Justice in The Hague.

The Spanish Foreign Ministry says at least 30 Spaniards are among the many Global Sumud Flotilla activists seized by Israeli forces in international waters overnight Thursday while attempting to deliver desperately needed humanitarian aid to Gaza.

STOCKHOLM, October 3. /TASS/. NATO's new Multi-Corps Land Component Command (MCLCC) officially opened its headquarters on October 3 in the Finnish city of Mikkeli, about 300 km from St. Petersburg, Russia.

"We set out to seek the establishment of a NATO command in Finland in autumn 2023 to maximize Finland's security. Our objectives were approved at the meeting of NATO Ministers of Defense in June 2024. Now, a year later, we are already launching the command," Defense Minister Antti Hakkanen said at the ceremony, as quoted by the ministry's press service.

Hakkanen stated that the headquarters' work would "strengthen NATO's defense capabilities" and "increase security in Finland." At present, it employs about ten people, with a peacetime staff expected to reach 50.

According to the Finnish Defense Ministry, the headquarters will plan and coordinate NATO ground forces' activities in Northern Europe. "In normal conditions," it will be responsible for NATO drills and other activities, while "in emergency conditions," it will "plan, command and control land operations and defense in the High North."

The MCLCC in Mikkeli began operations on September 1. The new headquarters is located less than 200 km from the Russian border. In September 2024, it was reported that in peacetime the facility would plan and carry out NATO training activities in the region. The so-called high-alert headquarters will operate around the clock under the authority of NATO's command in Norfolk, Virginia, on the US East Coast.

MOSCOW, October 3. /TASS/. Ukraine's foreign ministry claims that the US federal government shutdown has not disrupted weapons supplies, nor has it had any impact on the drone deal.

"False. Ukraine-US drone deal talks are proceeding as planned and shipments continue to arrive," Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman Georgy Tikhiy wrote on his X page.

The US government suspended its operations on October 1 after Congress failed to pass a budget for the new fiscal year amid disputes between Republican and Democrat representatives on a number of expenditure items, including public health spending. They accuse each other of provoking and prolonging the shutdown for political purposes.

A Ukrainian negotiating team arrived in Washington on October 1 for talks on the so-called drone deal providing for the joint production of drones worth up to $50 billion. Some Western media reported following the shutdown that the talks had been cancelled. Apart from that, according to the US media, supplies of US weapons to Ukraine could be delayed amid the shutdown.

The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) remains disconnected from the Ukrainian electricity grid and without external power for the 10th consecutive day, creating an increasingly "risky" situation,  experts told the Kyiv Independent.

Russian President Vladimir Putin referenced the crisis at the ZNPP, which is under Russian control, in his Oct. 2 remarks at the Valdai International Discussion Club,  again blaming Ukraine for the outage, despite evidence to the contrary, and threatening retaliatory strikes on Ukrainian nuclear power plants. 

Beyond the escalating rhetoric, experts indicate that the danger at the plant, the largest nuclear power station in Europe, is real. 

Ukraine's state nuclear operator Energoatom warned that the diesel generators powering the plant are designed only for short-term emergency use and are not meant to sustain the plant's operational needs for an extended period. A shutdown of these generators could result in a loss of control over the facility's nuclear safety systems. 

President Volodymyr Zelensky described the situation at the Zaporizhzhia plant as "critical" on Sept. 30. Diesel generators are now supplying power to the plant, but one has already failed, he said.

Najmedin Meshkati, a professor of civil/environmental engineering, industrial and systems engineering and international relations at the University of Southern California, also confirmed that diesel generators "are not designed to be run in such a sustained period of time."


"No nuclear power plant in the world has ever been in the same situation as the ZNPP, and it is impossible to predict anything."
    

"It's a risky situation because emergency generators are big machines, and they could easily break down. They are reliable, but at the same time, (require) a high-maintenance type of machinery due to their wear and tear," Meshkati said.

"I would not be surprised if some of them break down after this length of period of being in operation," he added.

Ukraine's Energy Ministry told the Kyiv Independent that the situation is further complicated by Russia's failure to carry out scheduled repairs and maintenance, which increases the risk of diesel generator failure and threatens a shutdown of the nuclear fuel cooling system and failure of critical safety systems. This could lead to a nuclear or radiation accident.

"The potential consequences of the failure of safety systems at the ZNPP will be transboundary and pose a danger not only to Ukraine but also to many European countries," a spokesperson said.

"No nuclear power plant in the world has ever been in the same situation as the ZNPP, and it is impossible to predict anything," the spokesperson added.

The ZNPP has been under Russian occupation since March 2022. The six reactors were shut down a month after Moscow's occupation, but the facility still requires electricity to maintain cooling and prevent a nuclear incident.

Russian troops reportedly struck a power line on Sept. 23, severing the plant's connection to Ukraine's electrical grid. This marks the 10th and longest blackout at the plant since Russia's full-scale invasion began in 2022.

While Russian state media blame Ukraine for the strike, Greenpeace Ukraine published an investigation on Oct. 1, saying that there is no evidence of any military strikes around the pylons and power line network at the ZNPP. Greenpeace nuclear expert Jan Vande Putte told the Kyiv Independent that Russia can repair the line "in a matter of hours."

"But they don't do that. They created the crisis, and they want to manage it as a political strategy. It's a very precise sabotage," Vande Putte said.

President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed a similar sentiment, writing in an Oct. 1 social post that "Russia is deliberately creating the threat of radiation incidents, taking advantage, unfortunately, of the weak position of the IAEA and its director, Rafael Grossi, as well as the distraction of global attention."

Zelensky's statements came after a Russian attack on an energy facility in the town of Slavutych in Kyiv Oblast, which caused a several-hour blackout at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant on Oct. 1.

While ZNPP "is not going to blow up tomorrow," the situation is serious in a long-term perspective, Vande Putte said.  

"They (Russians) can let the crisis get worse. (...) They can move closer and closer to that point over the coming week, and to have that kind of nuclear blackmail. That's their strategy," he added.

Dmytro Orlov, Energodar mayor, who lives in Ukraine-controlled territory, told the Kyiv Independent that at the start of the Russian occupation, the power plant remained fully operational. 

"But they pressured the staff to the point that there was almost no one left to work there," he said. "All the equipment was shut down, is not being repaired, and is deteriorating. And the station has been turned into a military base."

"The nuclear power plant is no longer used as an energy facility, but is used exclusively for military purposes, and the goal is clear — international pressure. The occupiers are doing this (provocations) to use nuclear blackmail against the whole world," Orlov added.

An investigation by the Truth Hounds and Greenpeace Ukraine published on Sept. 24 detailed Rosatom's role in pressuring plant staff,  including torture, "including beatings, electrocution, sexual violence, mock executions, and threats to family members of detainees." Rosatom, the Russian nuclear giant, became ZNPP's operator after the occupation.

The report indicated that 78 staff members were unlawfully detained, while six were "tortured to death."

Meshkati suggests that Russia's actions at the power plant could be a negotiating tactic.

"Nuclear plants are too important to be used as a bargaining chip or for political horse-trading or power plays. They are really too dangerous. If something goes wrong, everybody, the friend and foe, will be hurt equally," Meshkati said.

Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on Oct. 2 that Russia deliberately cut power to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant as it's preparing to reconnect the facility to its own energy system.

Greenpeace Ukraine published a report on Sept. 27 that used satellite imagery and Rosatom's reports indicating  that Russia wants to restart one of the reactors, and reconnect the grid to the occupied territories and eventually to the Kremlin.

Vande Putte also suggests that Russia's motivation is based "not so much for electricity reasons, but for military and political reasons."

It's the way for them to say clearly "this is Russian territory, it's our nuclear power plant," Vande Putte said.

In a statement issued by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), chief Rafael Grossi said that the U.N. agency is "in constant contact with the two sides with the aim to enable the plant's swift re-connection to the electricity grid."

The EU has called on Russia to "immediately cease all military operations around the nuclear plant" and enable the repairs. In a Sept. 30 statement, the bloc's diplomatic service denounced Russian occupation of the plant as illegal and urged Moscow to withdraw its forces.

The Zaporizhzhia plant has faced repeated safety concerns since Russia's invasion, including power outages, nearby shelling and staffing shortages. A monitoring mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been stationed at the ZNPP since September 2022, but Russian authorities have frequently restricted its access.

            American climber Balin Miller has died at the age of 23 while climbing at Yosemite National Park, his mother confirmed on Thursday.
    


            Miller was attempting to summit El Capitan, Yosemite's iconic wall soaring 3,000 feet from the valley floor, via the “Sea of Dreams” route when the accident occurred, Jeanine Moorman – Miller's mother – wrote in a blog post on the VIRR website, the family's outdoor goods business.
    


            “This is unthinkable,” Moorman wrote in tribute to her son. “At this time, we do not yet know all the details. What we do know is that the world has lost an extraordinary soul, and our hearts are shattered.”
    


            Moorman went on to describe her son as having “a touch of Robin Williams' wild energy. Strategic, curious, and endlessly playful, he brought light wherever he went.”
    


            El Capitan is a popular destination for big-wall climbers, best known as the site of Alex Honnold's Oscar-winning “Free Solo” documentary, during which Honnold scaled the rock face without ropes.
    


            Miller had been hoping to lead a route at some point in Yosemite, Moorman said, having recently completed an ice and alpine climbing trip in his home state of Alaska.
    


            A popular figure in the climbing community, Miller would live stream some of his climbs on TikTok and was affectionately known as “orange tent guy” due to his eye-catching camping equipment.

            He would often wear silver glitter across his cheekbones during climbs, a look he likened to “a warrior putting makeup on before going into battle” in an interview with Climbing magazine earlier this year.
    


            According to Moorman, Miller was introduced to rock climbing by his father at a young age. His early years in the sport were spent in the mountains of Alaska, before graduating to “cliffs and ranges across the world, living a nomadic life in pursuit of adventure,” Moorman said.
    


            “Balin was full of life – a true wild card at heart,” she added. “He lived simply, often out of his silver Prius, scraping together a shoestring income to support his greatest passion: climbing.”
    


            In June, Miller completed what is believed to be the first solo climb of the Slovak Direct route on Mount McKinley in Alaska, North America's highest peak also known as Denali.
    


            Miller's death came on the first day of the federal government shutdown, with many national parks at risk of closing or having limited services available to visitors.

Police, politicians and Jewish leaders in Britain have implored pro-Palestinian groups to cancel planned demonstrations over the weekend out of respect for those who died in an attack on a synagogue in Manchester. 

But organizers have insisted the marches will go ahead, arguing that they have the right to free speech and to protest against the war in Gaza.

The showdown over the demonstrations intensified on Friday as mourners gathered for a vigil in Manchester to remember the two men who died and the three who were injured in what police have called a terrorist attack. 

The attack happened Thursday morning when a man rammed a car into a crowd outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue and then stabbed several people just as worshippers gathered for Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar.

Police have identified the assailant as 35-year-old Jihad al-Shamie. He moved to Britain from Syria as a young child and became a citizen in 2006. 

Mr. al-Shamie had not been flagged by any counterterrorism programs, but according to press reports he had a criminal record, and he was on police bail after being arrested earlier this year on suspicion of sexual assault.

Alan Levy, the synagogue's chair of trustees, who was inside the synagogue at the time of the attack, told ITV that he heard Mr. al-Shamie shout, “This is what you get for killing our children.”

Greater Manchester Police also confirmed on Friday that one of the deceased, 53-year-old Adrian Daulby, may have been shot by responding officers. Police shot and killed Mr. al-Shamie who was carrying a knife and wearing a vest that looked like it was lined with explosives. 

Police said Mr. Daulby was among several worshippers who were inside holding the doors closed so that Mr. al-Shamie couldn't get in. It's believed that one of the bullets fired by an officer went through the door and hit Mr. Daulby.

The cause of death has yet to be disclosed for the second victim, Melvin Cravitz, a 66-year-old security guard who was believed to be standing in front of the synagogue when the car drove into the crowd. 

Of the three people who were injured, police said one was struck by the car and another person standing near Mr. Daulby suffered a gunshot wound that was not life threatening. It's not clear how the other person was hurt. 

“Adrian and Melvin died as Jews for being Jews. The only way to defeat darkness, the only way to defeat unholiness, is with goodness,” said Rabbi Daniel Walker of Heaton Park Synagogue as he closed a vigil on Friday.

As the investigation into the attack continued, there were growing calls for pro-Palestinian demonstrations to be called off.

“Peaceful protest is a cornerstone of our democracy – and there is justified concern about the suffering in Gaza – but a minority have used these protests as a pretext for stoking antisemitic tropes,” British Prime Minister Keir Starmer wrote in an article for the Jewish Chronicle. “I urge anyone thinking about protesting this weekend to recognize and respect the grief of British Jews this week.”

Police chiefs in Manchester and London said their resources have been stretched to provide greater reassurance to the Jewish community. 

“I am directly appealing to all those who might be intending to protest this weekend to consider whether this is really the right time,” said Stephen Watson, Chief Constable of the Greater Manchester Police.

There have been regular marches across Britain for months in support of people in Gaza and many have drawn tens of thousands of people, including a few Jewish groups.

However, there has been criticism that some demonstrators have used hate speech and expressed support for Hamas, which is considered a terrorist organization in Britain. 

The government has moved to restrict some marches, and it recently banned one organization, Palestine Action, under terrorism legislation after alleging that members conducted a campaign of “intimidation and sustained criminal damage.” 

Hundreds of Palestine Action supporters have been arrested in recent weeks during demonstrations in London, and another event is planned for Saturday at Trafalgar Square.

During a visit to Manchester on Friday, Britain's Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis questioned why the marches have been allowed to take place. 

“We have witnessed an unrelenting wave of hatred against Jews being expressed on our streets, on campuses, right across social media, and in some of the media,” he told the BBC.

“You cannot separate the words on our streets, the actions of people in this way and what inevitably results which was yesterday's terrorist attack. The two are directly linked and therefore we call on the government yet again, we say get a grip on these demonstrations, they are dangerous.”

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said there was little the government could do to stop the demonstrations. “I can take my lead from the police, if they were to tell me there was an inability to respond and to police the protests, then there are powers that are available,” she said Friday.

The organizers of Saturday's demonstration in London, Defend our Juries, said cancelling the protest would only reward terrorism.

“Our thoughts are with everyone who has lost loved ones in the horrific attack on Heaton Park Synagogue,” the group said in a statement on Friday. 

“Cancelling peaceful protests lets terror win. It's more important than ever to defend our democracy, including our fundamental rights to peaceful protest and freedom of speech, and to take a stand tomorrow against killing and against oppression, and for peace and justice for all,” the statement added.

Sarah Mullally becomes the first woman to lead the Church of England in the 1,400-year history of the role.BEN STANSALL/AFP/Getty Images

The Church of England named Sarah Mullally on Friday as the next Archbishop of Canterbury, the first woman to hold the 1,400-year-old office, prompting immediate criticism from conservative Anglican churches in Africa who oppose women bishops.

The 63-year-old former nurse will become the ceremonial head of 85 million Anglicans worldwide and, like her predecessors, will face a Communion divided between conservatives and more liberal Christians in the West over the role of women in the Church and over same-sex couples.

While the appointment was welcomed by many religious leaders in Britain, Laurent Mbanda, archbishop of Rwanda and chairman of a global grouping of conservative Anglican churches, told Reuters that Mullally would not be able to unite the Communion.

A bishop in Nigeria said the choice was “very dangerous” because men should lead and women should follow. The Church of England's evangelical wing also called for a halt to what it called a drift away from scripture.

 

The Associated Press

Bishop of London since 2018, Mullally has previously championed blessings for same-sex couples, a major source of contention in the global Anglican Communion. Homosexuality is outlawed in some African countries.

In an address in Canterbury Cathedral on Friday, Mullally said she would seek to help every ministry to flourish, “whatever our tradition.”

On same-sex relationships, she told Reuters in an interview that the Church of England and the broader Anglican Communion had long wrestled with difficult issues.

“It may not be resolved quickly,” she added.

Mullally said she wanted the Church to tackle the misuse of power after sexual abuse scandals and safeguarding issues, and she condemned rising antisemitism following an attack on a synagogue in Manchester on Thursday which killed two men.

Reforms introduced more than a decade ago made it possible for a woman to become the 106th Archbishop of Canterbury. It is one of the last British institutions to have been run until now only by men.

But those reforms have been rejected by many churches in Africa and Asia.

“Christ is the head of the Church, man is the head of the family, and from creation God has never handed over the position of leadership to woman,” Nigeria's Funkuro Godrules Victor Amgbare told Reuters in Abuja.

Mullally will replace Justin Welby, who resigned over a child abuse cover-up scandal and who was criticized by some Anglicans for taking an activist role on social issues.

She spoke in her cathedral address of the difficulties of an age which “craves certainty and tribalism” and a country which is wrestling with complex moral and political questions around migration and communities feeling overlooked.

“Mindful of the horrific violence of yesterday's attack on a synagogue in Manchester, we are witnessing hatred that rises up through fractures across our communities,” she said, adding that it was her Christian faith that gave her hope in a world which often feels “on the brink.”

Mullally is also an outspoken opponent of legislation currently in parliament that would allow assisted dying, describing it as “unworkable and unsafe” and saying it poses a risk to the most vulnerable in society.

Mullally is a former cancer nurse who worked as England's Chief Nursing Officer in the early 2000s. She was ordained as a priest in 2002 and became one of the first women to be consecrated as a bishop in the Church of England in 2015.

The married mother of two adult children said there were similarities between nursing and Christian ministry.

“It's all about people, and sitting with people during the most difficult times in their lives,” she once told a magazine.

Linda Woodhead, professor of theology and religious studies at King's College London, said the Church needed Mullally's strong management skills.

“Her emphasis on unity, gentleness and strength is exactly what the Church, and nation, needs right now,” she said.

Reflecting the Church of England's status as the country's established church, the appointment was announced by Prime Minister Keir Starmer's office.

It was given formal consent by King Charles, the Supreme Governor of the Church of England, a role established in the 16th century when King Henry VIII broke from the Catholic Church.

David Pestell, 74, who heads a tourist guide group in Canterbury, reflected on Mullally's predecessors.

“Some of them have been very good, some of them have been pretty bad,” he said. “Some of them have been very contentious, and some of them ended up murdered. I hope it doesn't happen to this one. It's delightful.”

A federal judge recused himself on Oct. 2 from Oregon's lawsuit over President Donald Trump's plan to federalize Oregon National Guard troops to deal with civil unrest outside federal immigration facilities in Portland.

Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield filed suit against the Trump administration on Sept. 28 after the president said he would send troops to defend immigration facilities in Portland from “domestic terrorists.” The state is asking the federal district court to find the deployment unlawful and block it, saying Trump was exaggerating the threat of protests to justify taking control over state National Guard troops.

Ukrainian drones attacked the Orsknefteorgsintez oil refinery in Russia's Orenburg Oblast on Oct. 3, a source in Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent.

The facility lies about 1,400 kilometers (870 miles) from Ukraine-controlled territory.

Founded in 1935, Orsknefteorgsintez is one of the oldest and largest refineries in the southern Urals, with an annual capacity of 6.6 million tons of crude oil. 

Regional Governor Evgeny Solntsev confirmed the attack but claimed operations at the refinery were not disrupted. He said emergency services were working at the site. 

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. 

According to the SBU source, an evacuation was announced at the facility.

The facility produces motor gasoline, Euro 5 diesel, jet fuel, bitumen, and lubricants, serving as the only refinery in Orenburg Oblast and a key part of Russia's domestic energy network.

Ukraine has intensified drone strikes on Russian refineries in recent months.

"SBU continues to cause significant harm to the Russian economy by targeting facilities in the Russian oil and gas industry," the source said. "The reduction in oil dollar revenues to the budget directly affects the aggressor's ability to continue the war against Ukraine."

"Nearly 40% of Russia's oil refining capacity is currently out of operation."

Sixteen of Russia's 38 oil refineries have been targeted since August 2025, according to the Financial Times. 

The attacks have pushed Russian diesel exports to their lowest level since 2020.

Authorities at Munich International Airport ordered a suspension in flight operations shortly after 9:30 p.m. local time after multiple drones were spotted in the vicinity of the airport for the second time in less than 24 hours.

A Russian drone strike on a pig farm in Kharkiv Oblast killed approximately 13,000 pigs on Oct. 3, Ukraine's State Emergency Service (SES) reported.

Ukraine's Special Operations Forces said that its drones struck a P-14F "Lena" long-range detection radar system as well as a "Sopka-2" en route radar complex in Russia's Voronezh Oblast.



Both men were wearing protective gear marked "Press," Ukraine's 4th Separate Mechanized Brigade said, condemning the strike as a violation of international humanitarian law.

"Just today, Russia struck our gas infrastructure with 35 missiles, including ballistic weapons. It was a combined strike, and only half of the missiles were shot down," Zelensky said after a meeting with Ukraine's top military command. 

"Ukraine is a country with a very difficult fate. Why should we share in this difficult fate? We have our own fate, which is much easier than that of the Ukrainians," Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said in an interview.



The 59th Brigade of the Unmanned Systems Forces destroyed the Russian helicopter near the village of Kotliarivka, in Donetsk Oblast.



According to investigators, the suspect monitored Andriy Parubiy's daily routine and movements while preparing an escape plan abroad. Law enforcement officers detained him before he could leave Ukraine.

The disruption has stalled meetings between Ukrainian officials and U.S. counterparts from the Pentagon, State Department, and White House, according to the Telegraph.



The ship was intercepted by the French Navy on Sept. 28 and diverted to the coast of Western France while investigations continue.

The three men — Captain Davit Vadatchkor and assistant captains Robert Egizaryan and Santosh Kumar Chaurasia — had been accused of damaging undersea cables in the Baltic Sea.

MOSCOW, October 3. /TASS/. Vladimir Putin delivers major foreign policy statements at a Valdai Discussion Club session; Russian air defenses are capable of repelling Ukraine's potential use of US missiles; and Hamas seeks to introduce changes to Donald Trump's plan for Gaza. These stories topped Friday's newspaper headlines across Russia.

 

Russian President Vladimir Putin outlined the features of the emerging multipolar world in his address at the annual session of the Valdai International Discussion Club. He spoke harshly of European countries and stressed the need to revive relations with the US, noting, however, that if Washington sent Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, another round of escalation would follow, Vedomosti reports.

Putin's criticism of European politicians and a lack of similar direct criticism of Donald Trump shows his understanding of the special responsibility for maintaining global security that Russia and the United States share, Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies Director Ruslan Pukhov noted. This gives hope that Moscow and Washington will be able to prevent negative scenarios in Europe that its current leaders may create, the expert added.

There are no real prospects in sight to overcome the crisis in relations between Russia and the EU during the current European electoral cycle that will last until 2027, when France is set to hold its presidential election, political scientist Alexey Makarkin said. "Moscow's relations with European capitals are very bad, and they cannot be mended in the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, the United States is unwilling to cut off dialogue with Russia, regardless of the statements that Trump made recently," the analyst observed.

Even setting aside the Ukraine crisis, Moscow and Washington have a common agenda for consultations at the level of diplomatic workers, which particularly includes the issue of Russian property on US territory. As for Europe, discussions of both political matters and technical aspects have been shut down, Makarkin emphasized.

Putin paid much attention to the issues related to a multipolar world because he sees the positive trends of strengthening cooperation between countries, Alexander Kamkin, associate professor at the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation, pointed out. BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) are examples of such trends, but even outside of them, political processes are entering a completely different phase. According to Kamkin, the unipolar world has become a thing of the past and it's not only Russia but also China and India that don't want a return to a confrontation between two superpowers. That said, the "civilization states" are taking center stage in shaping the development of the global community in the coming centuries, the expert concluded.

 

Russian air defenses are capable of repelling all types of US missiles, experts told Izvestia, commenting on reports that the United States might approve the transfer of long-range Tomahawk and Barracuda missiles to Ukraine. Washington's increasingly hostile policy towards Russia could be linked to its desire to exert pressure on Moscow.

Konstantin Sukhoverkhov, program manager at the Russian International Affairs Council, noted that discussions of missile deliveries should be viewed both in military and political terms. "Washington realizes that the cruise missile issue involves not only military operations but also its bilateral ties with Moscow. This is why the US military and political advisors are assessing all possible risks," the expert explained.

The Ukrainian armed forces are unlikely to obtain the advanced Barracuda systems in the near future, military expert Dmitry Kornev believes. "Neither launchers nor the Barracuda missiles themselves are produced on a large scale at the moment, as trials aren't completed yet. They haven't even been adopted by the US army," he said. As for the Tomahawk cruise missiles, "launchers are scarce and the US itself has not yet started the full-scale deployment of these systems, so Washington is unlikely to export them at the expense of its own forces," Kornev added. Meanwhile, Europe could support the US initiative by expanding the supplies of British-French Storm Shadow/SCALP-EG missiles, the expert noted.

Russian air defenses can effectively destroy both US and European missiles, said military experts. "Cruise missiles are troublesome targets," military expert Yury Lyamin admitted. "The main difficulty in intercepting them is their low flight altitude, which complicates detection by radars, as well as their ability to follow complex routes to the target and bypass air defense systems. This is what the Ukrainian army needs US intelligence for. However, we know how to deal with them. In particular, air defense forces will more frequently change their positions, and also employ other methods. This is the adversary our systems have been built against since the Soviet era," he explained.

Russian air defense forces will face a difficult challenge if such missiles are delivered to Ukraine in large numbers, but it will not alter the situation on the battlefield, experts emphasized.

 

The prospects for a peace agreement on the Gaza Strip are once again uncertain. Hamas members disagree with US President Donald Trump's plan to resolve the situation in the enclave and want to introduce modifications, which Israel is certain to reject. The group insists on a staged release of Israeli hostages, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the entire strip, except for the buffer zone on the border with Israel, and the transfer of its weapons to Arab mediators, Izvestia writes.

"The problem is that the longer the conflict lasts, the more polarized the positions of the sides become. The only option is that the countries backing Hamas and its sympathetic governments cease their support for the group," said Middle East expert Andrey Ontikov. According to him, if Hamas feels isolated, some diplomatic progress may be achieved.

Danila Krylov, researcher at the Department of the Middle and Post-Soviet East at the Institute of Scientific Information on Social Sciences of the Russian Academy of Sciences, pointed out that neither side was willing to reconcile. "However, Hamas has been put in a difficult position, where all of its peace initiatives are being ignored, the mediation efforts of Egypt and Qatar have been cut short, and essentially, the recent attack on Doha made it quite clear to Qatar what Israel thinks about its mediation efforts," the expert stressed.

The political scientist added that in light of recent events, Hamas members were unlikely to alter anything because Trump pursued a very tough approach. "He has already threatened them with consequences. Besides, Israel maintains an absolutely categorical, unconstructive and non-negotiating stance," the specialist emphasized. In his opinion, a peace agreement may be reached but, like all previous ones, it won't last long. "Both sides will fail to respect the agreement but will distort it, that's for sure, simply judging by the situation on the front. In fact, it's not that important how Hamas will view a potential ceasefire but how the Israeli authorities will handle it because if Israel supports a truce but fails to respect it, nothing will depend on Hamas' policy," the expert concluded.

 

It will be difficult for the world's most popular cryptocurrency - Bitcoin - to rise in value almost ten-fold and hit the $1 million mark, which is what Telegram messenger founder Pavel Durov anticipates. However, if the cryptocurrency succeeds in becoming part of the traditional financial system and even being included in state reserves, it could both increase in price and be at least partially freed of its image as a highly volatile asset, Rossiyskaya Gazeta observes.

Bitcoin is currently trading at about $120,000, which is quite close to the record high of $123,500 that it reached in August.

"There are actually no grounds for Bitcoin's price to climb to $1 million at this stage, even if financial regulators establish conditions for that," said Gennady Fofanov, director general of the InvoiceCafe investment platform. According to him, Bitcoin is an extremely volatile cryptocurrency; its price has repeatedly surged and plummeted, influenced by both remarks by political figures and the overall macroeconomic climate. "Even taking into account that its present price is nearly $120,000, it is a long and challenging path to reach the $1 million level, given its volatility and sensitivity to outside factors," Fofanov underlined.

Still, the decision by leading countries to legalize cryptocurrencies could provide certain prospects for Bitcoin. The recent measures taken by the United States are an example of such gradual acceptance: in the summer, bills were adopted in the US that define the legal framework of cryptocurrencies and regulate stablecoins (digital assets linked to national currencies or other assets).

"Bitcoin is overly dependent on external influences. If the US continues a policy of legalization, it will reduce its volatility, but so far, we don't observe any significant progress in this regard," Fofanov emphasized.

Some have started to compare Bitcoin with gold, particularly because the cryptocurrency may gain a place in central bank reserves by 2030, Deutsche Bank noted. "The issue of cryptocurrencies' integration into government reserves is becoming important as central banks aim to diversify their assets to lessen reliance on traditional currencies such as the US dollar. Still, Bitcoin's portion will clearly remain small, about 2% of the total," the expert concluded.

 

Oil prices continue to steadily decline. Experts interviewed by Izvestia agree that the factors influencing energy prices are a mix of contradictions tied to the economy, politics and market expectations.

"Geopolitical forces will keep weighing on oil prices in the remaining months of 2025, along with trade wars that alter supply chains and affect the volume of fuel used for cargo transportation, as well as restrictions on the production and export of oil and petroleum products and the potential accumulation of resources for stable supplies to local markets," said Tamara Safonova, associate professor with the Institute of Economics, Mathematics and Information Technology of the Russian Presidential Academy.

Market participants currently aren't as sensitive to developments in the Middle East as they were a year ago, Finam analyst Nikolay Dudchenko noted. However, the issue of Iran's nuclear program remains unresolved. In addition, Israel continues to draw other countries into an international conflict (particularly through its recent strikes on Qatar). Besides, in the expert's view, tensions have begun to intensify around Venezuela.

The prospects for sustaining Russian oil exports look reliable at this point, said experts interviewed by Nezavisimaya Gazeta. "Sanctions against tankers have had a very limited impact on export revenues. Numerous vessels continue to openly transport Russian oil. Sanctions raise transportation costs and hinder the process, but they don't block the use of ships. After three years of confrontation, mechanisms have been developed quite well to use such tankers," Alexander Firanchuk, senior researcher with the Laboratory of International Trade at the Gaidar Institute, remarked.

"Most major buyers of Russian oil will continue to purchase Russian energy under almost any scenario. China is in a state of a permanent trade war with the US, so the threat of Western sanctions doesn't matter much for it. India did not stop Russian oil imports even after the US imposed tariffs, and the country's government has repeatedly stated that it will choose sources of import on its own," Finam analyst Sergey Kaufman pointed out.

The LNG Canada facility in Kitimat, B.C., started to ship cargoes earlier this year.Aaron Whitfield/The Globe and Mail

A decade ago, the United States exported almost no liquefied natural gas. The world's biggest LNG exporter was Qatar. The U.S., with barely any capacity to ship gas overseas, was responsible for around one-1000th of global LNG exports. 

That changed quickly. Massive private investments in the rapid build-out of LNG terminals and pipelines turned the U.S. into the world's largest exporter, almost overnight. Between 2013 and 2023, American LNG exports increased by more than 100,000 per cent. S&P Global estimates that over the next 15 years, U.S. LNG will generate US$1.3-trillion in economic activity and US$166-billion in federal and state tax revenue. 

Australia also quadrupled LNG exports over the same 10-year period. By 2024, it was the world's second-largest exporter.

And Canada? Despite being the world's fifth-largest producer of natural gas – ahead of both Qatar and Australia – Canada was late to the LNG party. While the U.S. was going from near-zero to the top of the charts, Canadian LNG exports went from zero to … zero.

Opinion: Canada, don't make the same mistake with LNG that Australia did

That is finally starting to change. The LNG Canada facility in Kitimat, B.C., began shipping cargoes earlier this year. Several other such projects are at various stages of development. And in September, when Prime Minister Mark Carney announced five major projects prioritized for regulatory fast-tracking, phase two of LNG Canada was the first item on his list. 

The good news for Canada is that there remains considerable demand for natural gas in Europe and Asia. That demand is reflected in high prices. 

The debate over whether Canada should build more oil pipelines to the coasts is going to consume a lot of political oxygen in the coming months. It's a nudge this country needs, because the last pipeline – TMX, the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion – has been a winner. Ottawa had to buy it and build it, and it suffered significant delays and cost overruns, but the pipeline is delivering hefty returns. 

It helped to close the gap between Canadian oil prices and the West Texas Intermediate benchmark. The result has been an economic boost – the Bank of Canada estimated that the opening of TMX permanently added a quarter percentage point to gross domestic product – along with a cash windfall for Alberta and the feds. 

Alberta Central chief economist Charles St-Arnaud recently estimated that the narrowing of the price gap through TMX raised oil industry revenues by $13-billion in the first year of operation. It also delivered an extra $4.4-billion in royalties to Alberta, along with an extra $1-billion in corporate taxes to the province and $2-billion to Ottawa.

Canada may be in a position to do something similar with natural gas. The gap between Canadian and U.S. gas prices is wide and the gap with global prices is vast. Reducing it would produce returns for the Canadian economy, along with a pile of new revenues for Alberta, Saskatchewan, British Columbia and the federal government. 

Though Canada still has only one working LNG terminal, this country is nevertheless the world's fifth-largest gas exporter. But until recently, the only place our exports could go was to the U.S.

Opinion: Let's build Canada now – or risk falling behind

Leaving aside the now omnipresent concern about excessive reliance on the American market, this is a problem because gas prices on this continent are far below international prices. And North America's low gas prices are lowest in Canada.

Late last month, Canadian spot prices even went negative. If you wanted to buy gas, the seller would have had to pay you. 

That's a rare situation, but a gap between Canadian prices and the U.S. Henry Hub benchmark is not. Earlier this week, when the AECO hub Western Canadian price was less than zero, the U.S. Henry Hub price was more than US$3. European and Asian benchmark prices were around US$11. 

The yawning chasm between global and North American prices is long-standing. It's the reason behind all that U.S. investment in turning gas into LNG, loading it on ships and sending it across the oceans, where it will fetch a much higher price. 

Building a new oil pipeline comes with political challenges. B.C. Premier David Eby has shown no eagerness for a new route to the Pacific, and there's significant Indigenous opposition in his province. In contrast, Mr. Eby has become an enthusiastic cheerleader for more LNG capacity on the West Coast, and he has quite a bit of Indigenous support. Because B.C. is a major gas producer, higher gas prices would benefit provincial coffers in Alberta and B.C. (and to a lesser degree, Saskatchewan), as well as in Ottawa.

I'm not here to knock the idea of another oil pipeline. But don't ignore the opportunity in gas – which risks getting less attention precisely because it's so much less politically fraught.

LONDON, October 3. /TASS/. Consultations on US military support for Ukraine have been halted following the suspension of the US government's operations, and deliveries of American weaponry may be affected, The Telegraph newspaper reported, citing a source within the Ukrainian government

"The main concern is we have a lot of discussions ongoing about future shipments [of weapons] <...> All future projects are a little bit harmed because people from the Pentagon, State Department and White House are not meeting and we lose the time because of this shutdown," the newspaper quotes the source as saying.

According to its information, negotiations between Ukrainian and American officials on a potential agreement for the transfer of drone manufacturing technology have been left in limbo. Meanwhile, Ukrainian delegations that had planned visits to the US in the coming weeks are now reassessing their plans.

As the publication notes, the cancellation of consultations between the two countries will raise concerns that the recent warming in relations could be undermined, while Ukraine continues to suffer devastating losses on the battlefield.

Earlier, The Wall Street Journal reported that a Ukrainian delegation arrived in Washington this week to work on agreements with US authorities regarding drones. According to the newspaper, the completion of agreements between Kiev and Washington could take several months.

The US government suspended its operations on October 1 after Congress failed to pass a budget for the new fiscal year.

 How Moscow Has Retained Influence in the Post-Assad Era

 Hanna Notte

When armed factions led by the group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham overthrew Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad last December, many observers believed that Russia's days in Syria were numbered. For decades, Moscow had nurtured close ties with the Assad family; less than a year ago, it bombed areas controlled by HTS. As the head of HTS, Ahmed al-Shara, took the reins in Damascus, The Economist warned that Russia's military presence in the country was “hanging by a thread.” Russians worried, too. Shortly after Assad's fall, Russian newspapers bemoaned the loss of a key ally in the Middle East, and military bloggers panicked over the future of Russia's bases and outposts in the country.

Since then, however, Russia has defied expectations, holding on to its main bases on Syria's coast—the Tartus naval facility and the Hmeimim airbase—and even entrenching itself in the country's northeast. Russian diplomats moved quickly to engage the new rulers in Damascus, benefiting from Syrians' perception that Russia is a great power and Shara's desire to build positive relations with all external governments. Syria's new leaders have, in turn, taken a constructive tone with Moscow, hoping for Russian energy, grain, friendly votes at the UN, and possibly, arms. By engaging Russia, Shara's government also seeks to deter former Assad loyalists from rearing their heads, to warn Western states that Syria can look elsewhere for support on energy and defense, and perhaps even to limit Israeli military action within its borders.

Other interested parties want Russia to retain a modest presence in Syria, too: as different forces vie for clout, Russia has emerged as everyone's favorite hedge. Both Israel and Turkey calculate that Russia's influence could be leveraged to prevent the other from becoming too strong. And the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a Kurdish-led militia, want Russia on their side in case the United States abandons them or Damascus tries to quash their hopes for autonomy.

The possibility that Russia could retain its foothold in Syria has caused some unease among European officials. In the spring, for instance, members of the European Parliament appealed to Syria's new government to ban Russia's military presence. Even if Moscow manages to preserve its bases, however, it will not be among the key players to shape Syria's destiny. Bogged down in Ukraine, it simply lacks the financial and military resources to do so, and it will be eclipsed by the Arab Gulf states, Turkey, and, should they step up their engagement, the United States and European countries. U.S. and European leaders should accept that Russia will have a modest presence in Syria and avoid forcing Syria's new government to pick between their help or Russia's. The best way for Washington and its partners to prevent an ambitious Russian return is to lend concerted and patient support for Syria's governance and economic recovery.

Russia's ties with the Assad family go back to the Cold War, when Hafez al-Assad—Bashar's father—solidified Syria's place in the Soviet Union's orbit. When Bashar parachuted into power in 2000, he felt no special affinity for Russia. He traveled to London and Paris before visiting Moscow. But he still maintained Syria's friendly relations with the Kremlin. A decade later, when he responded to a peaceful uprising with a violent crackdown that escalated into civil war, Russia shielded his regime from UN Security Council sanctions and, eventually, launched a military intervention to prop him up.

By intervening, Russia gained enormous leverage over the trajectory of the war in Syria. In 2017, Russia deployed its military police to certain so-called de-escalation zones as part of an initiative also backed by Iran and Turkey. By maintaining a military presence in the country and, later, negotiating evacuation deals for rebels, Russia amassed valuable experience dealing with different armed groups. It settled local tensions, imposed security arrangements throughout the country, and cultivated relationships it could benefit from today. Russia also fortified its military footprint on NATO's southern flank by expanding and upgrading the Tartus and Hmeimim facilities. Other countries intervening in Syria always had to consider Russia. The Gulf Arab states, which for a period supported different rebels; Iran and Hezbollah, which collaborated with Russia on the ground; and Israel, Turkey, and the United States all maintained deconfliction channels with the Russian military.

But when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Moscow became distracted and, in Syria, even complacent. The Kremlin thought it could maintain the Syrian status quo with limited effort and a reduced military presence. As Israel's response to Hamas's October 7, 2023, attack widened, it escalated its attacks on targets linked to Iran in Syria. In response, Russia stepped up its patrols near the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Moscow also intensified its bombardments of Idlib Province, a region controlled by anti-Assad rebels, to dissuade them from advancing. But these measures proved too little, too late. The rebels commenced their lightning offensive in late November 2024, and Russian forces largely stood aside, abandoning Assad to his fall.

Many observers expected Assad's ouster to bring Russia's influence in Syria to an end. Within days, a spokesman for the new transitional government called on Russia to reconsider its presence in the country. But Russia wasted no time in courting Syria's new rulers. Overnight, Russian TV stopped calling HTS a terrorist group. At the UN in early January 2025, Russian diplomats commended Syria's transitional government for acting “competently.” Later that month, a Russian delegation traveled to Damascus for wide-ranging negotiations, including on the future status of Russia's bases, investments into gas fields and ports, and—according to Syria's state-owned news agency, SANA—a request that Russia pay reparations for supporting Assad and contribute to Syria's reconstruction. Syria's new leaders also asked the Russian government to extradite Assad, who had fled to Moscow. (Russian President Vladimir Putin is unlikely ever to do so—even now that Syrian authorities have issued a formal arrest warrant—because he wants to maintain a reputation for sticking by his authoritarian partners.)

Russia was especially keen to preserve access to its military bases. Over the years, Tartus and Hmeimim had become critical logistics hubs for Russian operations in Africa. In the immediate aftermath of Assad's fall, Russia moved naval assets out of Tartus and consolidated its military aircraft, stationed at bases elsewhere in the country, at Hmeimim. In February, Syria's new defense minister hinted that Russia would be allowed to keep its bases as long as their existence served Syria's interests. “In politics, there are no permanent enemies,” he said.



Negotiating over its bases, Russia has reminded Syria of the support it can offer. In the spring, Russia shipped oil, diesel, and wheat to Syria. According to Reuters, the Russian company Goznak, which is under British, European Union, and U.S. sanctions and has long printed Syria's currency, will issue the country's new banknotes. With its veto on the UN Security Council, Russia could help remove the UN's terrorist designations, which come with travel bans and asset freezes, on Shara and others close to him. Trained on Soviet and Russian systems, Syria's new army may also hope for Russian weapons in the future, especially because much of its military capability has been decimated by Israeli strikes over the past year.

Many Syrians loathe Moscow for the countless bombs it dropped on Syrian cities in support of Assad. But Syrians never perceived Russia—as they did Iran—as sectarian or bent on changing the very fabric of their society. Russia was seen as a cynical, pragmatic, ruthless, great power with a long history in the Middle East. These perceptions—plus the fact that Maher al-Shara, Ahmed's brother, has family ties to Russia—also help explain why Russia was not chased out of Syria outright.

Syria's new rulers signaled early on that they were willing to build a new relationship with what they called the “second most powerful country in the world.” In July, a delegation of 20 Syrian officials including the foreign and defense ministers, the intelligence chief, and Maher al-Shara, who serves as secretary-general of the presidency, visited Russia. The two countries agreed to reactivate the Syrian-Russian Joint Committee to reevaluate Assad-era agreements and discuss economic cooperation. SANA heralded the visit as the beginning of a new era in relations.

Syria's new rulers have much to deal with in their effort to stabilize the country's fractured domestic landscape. In March, Sunni militants killed over 1,000 people, many of them Alawite, on Syria's coast. In July, hundreds of people died in clashes between Bedouin and Druze fighters in the country's southwest. Israel has captured a buffer zone adjacent to the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights and regularly hit sites deep inside Syria, even as the two countries have begun to negotiate a security agreement.

In that context, Damascus's bilateral engagement with Moscow serves several additional purposes. It sends a message to U.S. and European countries that Syria has other doors to knock on. Russian-Syrian diplomacy might disabuse any remaining Assad loyalists inside the country of the notion that they can play the Kremlin and Shara off each other. And Syria's new rulers may hope that Putin will use his good relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to get Israel to rein in its military activities on Syrian territory. As Syria's new rulers strive for “zero problems” with foreign powers they seem to believe that it is useful to keep things amicable with the Kremlin.

Israel has its own reasons for wanting Russia to maintain a modest presence in Syria. Israel views Shara as a radical Islamist with questionable intentions and fears the growing role of Turkey—a country it accuses of anti-Semitism and spreading political Islam—in Syria and the wider region. Turkey wants a highly centralized Syria to quash the Syrian Kurds' aspiration for autonomy. Israel, meanwhile, prefers a decentralized Syria—perhaps not as a matter of principle, but because Israel doesn't trust the country's current rulers and calculates that a fragmented Syria will be easier to handle. Israel's leaders seem to think that Russia's presence might help keep the country divided into zones of influence.

Turkey sees utility in a Russian presence in Syria for many of the same reasons. Ankara has registered Israel's daring attacks and Saudi Arabia's forays into Syria with apprehension. In the past, Riyadh has funded the SDF. Turkey hopes that it could turn to Russia to keep Israel at bay, support removing the UN Security Council's terrorist designation on Shara, supply the weak Syrian military with weapons, and back Ankara's position against Syrian Kurds. Such hopes are not without basis. When Assad was in power, Russia acquiesced to Turkish military operations against the SDF and jointly patrolled parts of northern Syria with Turkey.

Yet it is perhaps the vulnerable SDF that counts on Russia the most. The group is at risk of losing autonomy as Shara tries to consolidate power. In recent months, the SDF has increased its engagement with Russia with the aim of gaining an advantage over Turkey and the government in Damascus—and to have an additional ally in case the United States makes good on its promise to substantially reduce or even end its military presence in Syria's northeast. Russia is already moving in. Through the spring and summer, Moscow deployed air defense systems and electronic warfare units—which would allow Russia to jam radio signals—to its base at Qamishli airport (located in a Kurdish-majority area), expanded housing for its troops, and fortified the base's perimeter. Notwithstanding its cooperation with Turkey, Russia has in the past called for the protection of Kurdish rights and offered to mediate between Kurdish leaders and Syria's central government. Israel, Turkey, and the SDF each seek to leverage Russia's presence to accomplish goals that are fundamentally incompatible; given Russia's shrewd maneuvering in the past, each one has some reason to hope that Moscow will end up supporting their parochial ambition.

For the foreseeable future, Syria will remain fragmented and weak, with external powers competing for sway over Damascus and for informal spheres of influence. In this fluid landscape, Russia will be one among many players, and far from the most important. As Shara prepares for his first visit to Russia, planned for October, it appears that Moscow has avoided expulsion from Syria. Yet more than anything, Syria now needs economic support, financial investment, and the lifting of all remaining international sanctions. To accomplish these aims, the Arab Gulf states, Turkey, the United States, and European countries will be key, not Russia. Even before it invaded Ukraine, Russia had little bandwidth to focus on Syria's economic recovery and reconstruction; with its resources now sunk deep into Ukraine, it has even less to spare.

If Russia can hold on to its bases while continuing to prove its utility to the different forces that are competing to shape Syria's future, it will still be quite a feat. Russia's influence in Syria and the regional clout that came with it will never be what it was before Assad's fall. But Russia will retain a military foothold on which it could build in the future—and from which it could continue to support its operations in the rest of the Middle East and Africa, especially once the war in Ukraine ends. Africa Corps, a Russian paramilitary outfit, is currently consolidating its presence in West Africa, a region the Kremlin views as important. Retaining its logistics nodes in Syria could help Russia expand there in the future.

Still, Western states should not penalize Syria's new leaders for engaging Russia in the context of their pragmatic, multi-vector foreign policy. Soon after Assad fell, for example, the Dutch foreign minister, Caspar Veldkamp, suggested that the EU should consider lifting sanctions only if Syria expels Russia. “We want the Russians out,” he said. But Shara has no intention of returning the country into Russia's orbit. In fact, he is maintaining a delicate balance between Russia and its adversaries. In September, Syria restored diplomatic ties with Ukraine. And it is unlikely that Russia's bases will serve as a conduit for Iran to claw its way back into Syria. The Israeli military would likely nip such an effort in the bud.

As Syria's authorities navigate formidable challenges, it only seems prudent for them not to antagonize Russia. Rather than panicking over Moscow's maneuverings or conditioning their own support on Syria's total break with Russia, U.S. and European leaders should focus on helping Syrians recover after a decade of civil war and a half century of despotism. The best way to ensure that Syria will not allow Russia to exploit its territory in the future is to build good relations with Damascus today.

 The Collapse of Global Norms Fueling the Catastrophes in Gaza and Sudan

 Alex de Waal

In late August, two of the world's leading food crisis assessments came to the same conclusion about what is happening in Gaza: “famine with reasonable evidence.” One was the UN-affiliated Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC); the other was the U.S.-based Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), a partnership of government agencies formerly under the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Both bodies use rigorous criteria to designate five progressive levels of food insecurity, with “famine” as the worst. In concluding that Gaza had reached level 5, the IPC further noted that since the crisis is “entirely man-made, it can be halted and reversed.”

For months, the starvation of Gaza has seized international attention. But it is not the only war-induced famine unfolding in the world right now. In fact, it is not even the worst. In July 2024, the IPC concluded that “famine with reasonable evidence” was unfolding in war-torn Sudan, where large parts of the population have been cut off from food aid. Since then, the situation has only worsened. According to recent IPC estimates, some 800,000 Sudanese are now suffering full-blown famine and another eight million face what the IPC calls a level 4 food “emergency,” just one step below that threshold. And just below that, some 22 million people—an astounding half of the country's total population—are contending with a level 3 food “crisis,” meaning they need aid in order to avoid becoming trapped in a doom loop of hunger and destitution. Current cease-fire proposals for both Sudan and Gaza—including the Trump administration's new plan for Gaza unveiled on September 29—call for the reopening of humanitarian-aid channels as soon as the fighting stops. But for both populations, that may be too late. International humanitarian law dictates that essential aid should not be contingent on a cease-fire.

Famines under any circumstance have been comparatively rare since the late twentieth century. In recent decades, bigger and more skilled relief agencies and better early-warning systems have made it much easier to address hunger crises before they reach catastrophe. By the 2010s, an international consensus also seemed to have emerged against the starvation weapon. In 2018, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2417—which formally highlighted the link between armed conflict and hunger and condemned depriving civilians of food as a method of warfare. At the time, China, Russia, and the United States each preferred to denounce some regimes while being more lenient toward others. But they all voted for the principle that intentionally starving civilians was a war crime.

Just seven years later, that looks like a long-lost era, and not only because of the disastrous wars in Gaza and Sudan. In conflicts around the world, including in Ethiopia, Myanmar, and Ukraine, military forces and their backers have once again been weaponizing hunger. Yet leading global powers, distracted by volatile geopolitical shifts, new rivalries, and economic challenges at home, have done little to stop them. Meanwhile, the humanitarian-aid budgets of many wealthy countries have been drastically cut. The result is that more and more, belligerents can inflict mass starvation on vulnerable people with impunity.

Withholding access to food is among the oldest weapons of war. In the twentieth century alone, it was used by all sides in both world wars, by colonial powers such as the French in Algeria and the British in Malaya, and by governments fighting separatists such as Nigeria in the 1960s and Ethiopia in the 1980s. In Sudan, successive regimes have for decades resorted to starvation campaigns to achieve military aims. In 1988, near the frontline of a previous civil war between the government and southern rebels, I witnessed unchecked starvation, with civilians dying at a rate almost 50 times the IPC famine threshold. The Sudanese brigadier in charge of that sector made no pretense about the government's aim: “We're hungering out the rebels,” he said. As the officer well knew, the men with the guns are always the last to go hungry—so his forces were creating a famine and emptying the land of civilians, at which point the insurgents would have to either surrender or starve.

The horrors of that war were a catalyst for change. The next year, under U.S. pressure, Khartoum allowed the UN to set up Operation Lifeline Sudan, the first time the UN crossed the battle lines to aid civilians in a rebel zone. It had an immediate impact. (Khartoum's generals later complained that the intervention cost them victory and ultimately led to the secession of South Sudan.) Over the following decades, data on hunger crises also improved. During the 2010s, when manmade famines loomed in northern Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, and Yemen, FEWS NET and the IPC—which had been set up in the 1980s and the early 2000s, respectively—allowed the world to track the progressive effects in real time, in color-coded maps. Humanitarians now had a blueprint for how to monitor and prevent starvation; they just needed high-level political backing to sweep away the roadblocks, open aid corridors, and demand cease-fires.



With the UN Security Council's passage of Resolution 2417, it looked like that resolve had finally crystallized. At the time, U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley spoke passionately against the hunger weapon, singling out the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad, which had freely used starvation sieges in Syria's civil war. She refrained from publicly condemning Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for their blockade of Yemen, but U.S. officials worked quietly—and effectively—to ensure that aid was delivered. For the first time, both the United States and its global rivals appeared to be united in the determination to make starvation a war crime.

But that moment was short-lived. After Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine and blockade of Ukraine's grain exports, international attention shifted to securing global food supplies. To get Russian President Vladimir Putin to consent to the UN's Black Sea Grain Initiative, which aimed to allow Ukraine to safely export food, the UN had to speak softly about Moscow's own use of starvation against Ukrainians, including the Russian army's 85-day siege of the city of Mariupol. By this point, Ethiopia had already begun a war of starvation against the rebellious region of Tigray. When the IPC predicted famine, Addis Ababa simply responded by dismantling the country's IPC working group, which, as the host government, it chaired. Famine denialism—keeping out journalists and suppressing humanitarian data—proved effective, and others have since followed that playbook. Tigray was a key test of Resolution 2417, but in the end, the Biden administration wasn't ready to press for tough measures at the UN Security Council when Ethiopia failed to end the blockade. By 2023, the year the current wars in Sudan and Gaza started, starvation tactics were already making a comeback.

Sudan is today's biggest and most intractable famine. Amid the vicious two-and-a-half-year civil war between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a ruthless paramilitary organization led by General Mohamed Hamdan Dagolo, known as Hemedti, the numbers of hungry, destitute, and displaced are mounting every day. Because the warring parties restrict aid operations and many parts of the country are difficult to access, data is poor. But there's no doubt that millions of civilians face truly desperate conditions, and even by conservative estimates, tens of thousands of them, most of them children, have already perished.

This tragedy is a direct result of actions taken by the warring parties on a population that is especially vulnerable to food weaponization. Before the current war began, more than two million people in Darfur were already living in camps and relied on World Food Program rations—more than half of which was funded by USAID. In the Nuba Mountains in the south of the country, there was an ongoing food emergency. Sudan's urban dwellers were hungry, too: the Sudanese economy had all but collapsed, in part because of the loss of oil revenues following the independence of South Sudan, where most of the oil was located. In this precarious situation, RSF forces have systematically pillaged towns and villages and laid siege to El Fasher, the last SAF stronghold in Darfur, for more than 500 days. Trapped inside are some 250,000 people who are cut off from food. 

In turn, Burhan has exploited his status as the head of the UN-recognized government to restrict the flow of aid into Darfur and other RSF-controlled areas. Meanwhile, in the Nuba Mountains, a three-sided war is unfolding—between the RSF, SAF, and the Sudan People's Liberation Army-North, which draws its support from the Nuba people, non-Arab farming communities who have long resisted the Arab-Muslim domination of the Sudanese state. Although the SPLA-N and RSF recently signed a political pact, people in encircled towns and ravaged villages continue to starve.



Without immediate intervention, it is almost certain that tens of thousands of Sudanese will die of hunger in the coming months. Yet this catastrophic situation has failed to trigger international action. This year, the UN scaled back its emergency appeal for Sudan, aiming to reach just two-thirds of the 30.9 million people in need. Even so, as of September, that bare-bones goal is barely 25 percent funded. Until January this year, USAID supported 1,400 community kitchens across Sudan, which were run by a network of local volunteers and were considered highly effective. But with the Trump administration's gutting of USAID, 900 of the kitchens have been forced to closed. 

Meanwhile, the United Kingdom and the European Union, once aid superpowers, are tightening their purse strings, and wealthy Arab states, which have been meddling on both sides of the civil war, aren't footing the bill. Even the UN Security Council has been unable to muster a strong response. In June 2024, the council passed, with Russia abstaining, a resolution ordering the RSF to allow aid into El Fasher. But in November, Moscow vetoed a second, more forceful resolution, saying it infringed on Sudanese sovereignty—a sign of how impunity has become the norm.

In mid-September, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, together with his counterparts in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates—collectively the Quad—announced a cease-fire plan that requires the two sides to immediately allow in humanitarian aid. It's the right plan, and hopefully the other Quad members will set aside their differences and press the generals to implement it. But that's only the first step. To actually stop the crisis, an international aid campaign must not only purchase and ship food and medicine to Sudan but also ensure that they are delivered to where they are most needed, a process that involves relief convoys traversing vast distances on poor roads with numerous roadblocks where local commanders run extortion rackets. For those already sucked into the vortex of famine, this slow timeline could be a death sentence.

If Sudan is the world's worst manmade hunger crisis, Gaza has become its most visible. For months, images of starving children and crowds of desperate people risking life and limb in a struggle for food have shocked the international public. In their August reports, the IPC and FEWS NET added hard data and expert judgment to those images. Even before Israel's ground invasion of Gaza City began, conditions were dire for the nearly one million people remaining there. Fully 30 percent of them—more than the “famine” threshold of 20 percent—had no access to food at all. 

Because of extremely limited access, the IPC was unable to obtain its preferred metric for malnutrition—surveys of weight-to-height ratios of children under five. But using its second-best measure, surveying children's mid-upper-arm circumference, it found a sixfold increase in malnutrition between early June and later July—the kind of exponential spike that occurs when a population is spiraling into famine. By August, reported deaths from starvation were also mounting, and the IPC inferred, in line with its data from previous crises, that these numbers are a small fraction of the overall hunger toll, with many more perishing from the ravages of disease on malnourished bodies and low rates of survival after surgery because wounds need nutrition to heal.

Beyond pointing out that the famine is manmade, neither the IPC nor FEWS NET allocates blame. But the causes have been plain for the world to see. In early March, Israel began a total blockade of Gaza and did not allow food into the territory for 11 weeks. And when Israel, under enormous pressure, finally allowed some aid to resume, it insisted that aid would henceforth be distributed not by the UN and long-established humanitarian nongovernmental organizations, but by a new entity, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, under the supervision of the Israel Defense Forces. 

The switch of aid delivery to the inexperienced GHF, at precisely the moment when Gaza's population was plunging into famine, was disastrous. Instead of the 400 or so centers run by the UN and its partners, the GHF has just four locations, three of them in the far south and one in the center of Gaza—and none at all in Gaza City or the north. As has been widely reported, aid distribution from these sites has been plagued by violence, with more than 1,000 people shot and killed by IDF soldiers and private security contractors. The GHF cannot say who has eaten, sold, or hoarded the food boxes it is distributing. Quite possibly, substantial amounts have been grabbed by various criminal gangs or by Hamas itself—another count of GHF's lethal incompetence.

Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu has tried to dismiss the pictures of starving children as “fake” and claimed falsely that the IPC has lowered its thresholds for famine. The IPC has responded with detailed technical explanations of its methods, in line with its well-established protocols. (Notably, Israel was quiet about what transpired last May, when FEWS NET reported that northern Gaza was in famine, and the IPC adjudged that the evidence didn't yet warrant the finding.) If Israel wanted to clear its name, it could permit better humanitarian data gathering—and indeed, allow international journalists to enter Gaza. But it has not. Aid practitioners know what's needed to reverse the Gaza famine, and because the area is small and accessible, they could make it happen very quickly. But in order to do so, external powers, and particularly the United States, must force Israel to allow the UN and humanitarian agencies to do their job, unhindered and at scale.



The United States has the power to turn this crisis around. In March 2024, the Biden administration pressured Israel to allow in more aid, and the crisis was briefly ameliorated. In January 2025, the incoming Trump administration insisted on a cease-fire, and Israel concurred. In early August, responding to international outrage, Israel allowed more food in, and the exponential increase in malnutrition rates charted by the IPC flattened. And now, U.S. President Donald Trump's 20-point plan for Gaza promises “full aid” to begin through the UN and humanitarian agencies when Israel and Hamas accept the agreement. That could end starvation quickly. In the meantime, if Netanyahu's Operation Gideon's Chariots II forces the evacuation of Gaza City, that will mean the closure of 11 of Gaza's 18 remaining hospitals and make it impossible to save the most malnourished children. Every day counts.

For aid workers, the urgency of needs has created a larger dilemma. With few other options, senior UN officials reluctantly began talking with the GHF, exploring whether collaboration might be possible. Established humanitarians condemned this, arguing that the GHF doesn't adhere to core humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality, and independence. To a degree, these shortcomings should not be disqualifying: after all, an occupying power—such as Israel in Gaza—has legal obligations to provide aid, but it clearly isn't neutral or independent. 

But ending mass starvation requires more than handing out boxes of food. It also must reverse the dehumanizing effects. In such a crisis, people are so gripped by hunger that they may transgress social norms—scavenging in garbage heaps, eating animal fodder, and stealing food or hiding it from their neighbors. Survivors often remember famines as when they lived like animals and may be scarred by shame and humiliation. Thus far, the GHF has failed the test of humanity because it fails to treat Palestinians as dignified human beings. The foundation's basic rations might keep people alive but destroy their dignity in doing so.

Today's surge in starvation crimes may portend even worse in the future. Observing the lack of accountability in Tigray, Mariupol, El Fasher, and now Gaza City, autocrats and warlords in any of a dozen of the world's hot spots may well seize the chance to employ this terrible weapon. Danger spots include a looming new war between Ethiopia and Eritrea, escalating conflicts in the West African Sahel, Myanmar's ongoing campaign to destroy the country's Rohingya minority, and Venezuela's relentless food crisis.

Paradoxically, this trend is occurring even as international bodies have finally begun to condemn weaponized starvation. Eighteen months ago, in the case brought by South Africa against Israel, the International Court of Justice ruled that Israel should immediately provide a full spectrum of humanitarian relief and essential services, at scale and unhindered. Aharon Barak, the Israeli judge nominated to sit on the court, voted for the measure, making it unanimous. Israel hasn't complied, a failing that increases the risk that the ICJ will in due course find that the Israeli government hasn't met its duty to prevent genocide. In November 2024, the International Criminal Court for the first time cited starvation crimes in announcing international arrest warrants against Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, giving a high profile to the issue. On Sudan, UN Security Council Resolution 2736, of June 2024, still stands, demanding humanitarian aid and protection of civilians in the famine zone—but has never been enforced. Failing to enforce these decisions risks making a mockery of them.

In a world with apparently insoluble problems, preventing famine is one of the easier ones. Sufficient humanitarian funding is one step—$85 billion would meet the UN's overall target for this year. That's tiny compared with current spending on arms or the development of artificial intelligence. And those funds won't be needed next year if agreed measures against starvation crimes are enforced. States can legitimately fight in self-defense, but the rules of war must be obeyed. The humanitarian tent can be expanded to include new organizations, but they must be made to comply with rigorous professional standards and conform to the principle of humanity.

The global consensus against the starvation weapon took decades to achieve. Now, international apathy risks letting it collapse at the moment it is most needed. Political solutions in Sudan and between Israel and Palestine may be hard to find, but keeping people from starving is perfectly feasible. It should be something on which all can agree.

ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) — French soccer great Zinedine Zidane's son Luca was called up by Algeria for the first time Thursday, with the team close to qualifying for the 2026 World Cup in North America.

Luca Zidane, a 27-year-old goalkeeper, represented France at youth level but never for the senior national team and is eligible for Algeria through his father's family ties.

FIFA approved a change of national eligibility two weeks ago for Zidane, who once played at Real Madrid when his father was coach there. He is now with Spanish second-division team Granada.

Algeria coach Vladimir Petkovic picked Zidane in a 26-player squad for qualifying games against Somalia on Oct. 9 and Uganda five days later.

Algeria leads the qualifying group by four points and a win in either game would send the team to the World Cup being co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico.

Algeria has played at four men's World Cups and reached the round of 16 at its last appearance in 2014.

Zinedine Zidane played at three World Cups for France, winning the 1998 title at home and losing the final in 2006. His red card in extra time of the 2006 final for headbutting Italy defender Marco Materazzi is part of World Cup lore and was his final game as a player.

NEW YORK, October 3. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump said that the import duties he imposed would bring the United States revenue of more than $1 trillion per year.

In an interview with One America News television channel, Trump stated that revenues from new tariffs were just starting to flow in but eventually they could reach $1 trillion a year.

Speaking at the 80th session of the UN General Assembly last month, Trump said the United States was ready to conduct trade with all countries provided that the principles of fairness and reciprocity are respected.

According to the US president, the tariffs that the US administration has imposed on most countries of the world are a protective mechanism.

European defense ministers have agreed to develop a 'drone wall' to intercept drones violating Europe's airspace.Mikhail Metzel/The Associated Press

Russian President Vladimir Putin warned the United States that supplies of long-range missiles to Ukraine will seriously damage relations between Moscow and Washington but will not change the situation on the battlefield, where the Russian army is making slow but steady advances.

The potential supply of U.S. Tomahawk cruise missiles to Kyiv will signal a “qualitatively new stage of escalation, including in relations between Russia and the U.S.,” Putin said at a forum of international foreign policy experts in Russia's Black Sea resort of Sochi.

The Russian leader noted that even though Tomahawk missiles will inflict damage on Russia if supplied to Ukraine, Russian air defences will quickly adapt to the new threat. “It will certainly not change the balance of force on the battlefield,” he added, emphasizing that the Russian military is continuously making gains against Ukraine.

Asked about U.S. President Donald Trump dismissing Russia as a “paper tiger” because of its failure to defeat its smaller neighbour after more than 3 1/2 years of fighting, Putin argued that Russia has faced all the NATO allies backing Kyiv.

“We are fighting against the entire bloc of NATO and we keep moving, keep advancing and feel confident and we are a paper tiger; what NATO itself is?” he said. “A paper tiger? Go and deal with this paper tiger then.”

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Putin's remarks.

At the same time, Putin hailed U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to help negotiate peace in Ukraine and described their August summit in Alaska as productive.

“It was good that we made an attempt to search for and find possible ways to settle the Ukrainian crisis,” he said, adding that he felt “comfortable” talking to Trump.

Putin also reaffirmed his offer to the U.S. to extend their last remaining nuclear arms control pact for one more year after it expires in February. The 2010 New START treaty limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers.

“If they don't need it, we don't need it either,” he said, adding that “we feel confident about our nuclear shield.”

While praising Trump and trying to emphasize potential common interests, the Russian president sent a stern warning to Ukraine's Western allies against trying to seize ships that carry Russian oil to global markers. He argued that would amount to piracy and could trigger a forceful response while sharply destabilizing the global oil market.

Threatening a forceful response to Western “piracy,” mocking drone claims

Asked about the detention of an oil tanker off France's Atlantic coast, which President Emmanuel Macron linked to Russia's so-called shadow fleet of aging tankers of uncertain ownership that are avoiding Western sanctions, Putin cast it as an attempt by Macron to distract public attention from his country's own internal problems and mockingly likened the French leader to Napoleon.

He strongly warned the West against such action, arguing that it defies international maritime law and risks triggering military confrontation. “It's piracy, and how do you deal with pirates? You destroy them,” he said.

Putin also scoffed at Western claims of possible Russian involvement in recent drone flights over Denmark, casting them as part of purported NATO efforts to “inflame tensions to boost the defence spending.”

Intrusions into NATO's airspace blamed on Russia reached an unprecedented scale last month. A swarm of Russian drones flew into Poland, Estonia complained about an intrusion by Russian fighter jets and numerous unidentified drones were sighted over Denmark, Germany and other countries in what some European officials described as Moscow testing NATO's response.

European defence ministers have agreed to develop a “drone wall” along their borders to better detect, track and intercept drones violating Europe's airspace.

Putin dismissed Western allegations of Russia's purported aggressive plans against NATO allies as “nonsense” aimed at distracting public attention from domestic problems.

“We are carefully watching the growing militarization of Europe,” he said. “Is all of this just words or is it time for us to take countermeasures? No one should have doubt that Russia's countermeasures will not take a long time to come.”

Asked about Charlie Kirk's assassination, Putin called it a “heinous crime” that reflected a “deep split” in American society. He hailed Kirk as a hero killed for promoting the same conservative values that Russia shares.

Putin also praised Michael Gloss, an American and the son of a deputy CIA chief, who joined the Russian military and was killed in action in Ukraine in 2024. He said he had awarded Gloss with a medal, which he handed to Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff during his visit to Moscow.

The Russian leader likened Gloss to Kirk, saying they championed similar “traditional” values. “He gave his life while defending those values as a Russian soldier, and Kirk gave his life while fighting for the same values in the United States,” Putin said.

In response to questions about Gloss, the CIA said in a statement that the agency “considers Michael's passing to be a private family matter – and not a national security issue. The entire CIA family is heartbroken for their loss.”

At one point during the four-hour event televised live, Putin, a former Soviet KGB officer and one-time head of Russia's top domestic security agency, misspoke and referred to himself as “the CIA director” while describing a meeting with President George W. Bush and his administration officials. “The future director,” Putin quipped as the audience broke into laughter.

About 60 students walked out of morning classes on Oct. 1 to protest their high school's policy allowing male students who identify as transgender to use girls' bathrooms, in Anaheim, California.

Joining the students at a press conference at Esperanza High School, opponents of state polices allowing transgender-identifying males to compete in girls' and women's sports and use female bathrooms and locker rooms said it's time for the Trump administration to follow through on its threats to withhold federal funding from schools accused of violating Title IX.

PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Five years after protests roiled Portland, Oregon, the city known for its history of civil disobedience is again at the center of a political maelstrom as it braces for the arrival of federal troops being deployed by President Donald Trump.

Months of demonstrations outside Portland's immigration detention facility have escalated since Trump said last week he was sending federal troops to the city, which he described as “War ravaged.” Police made a few arrests late Thursday after fights broke out in the crowd, including of conservative influencer Nick Sortor on a disorderly conduct charge.

On Friday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the agency would send additional federal agents and the Justice Department was launching a civil rights investigation into the circumstances surrounding Sortor's arrest, and whether the Portland Police Bureau engages in viewpoint discrimination.

City leaders adamantly deny any such discrimination and said they don't need the National Guard to help handle the single block outside the ICE facility where the protests have occurred.

“Last night, the arrests that we made, we made based upon probable cause, not based upon individuals,” Police Chief Bob Day told a news conference Friday. “There is no political bias associated with our enforcement.”

Meanwhile, a federal judge heard arguments — but did not immediately rule — on whether to temporarily block Trump's call-up of 200 Oregon National Guard members, which the administration said is needed to protect the ICE facility and other federal buildings.

The escalation of federal law enforcement in Portland, population 636,000 and Oregon's largest city, follows similar crackdowns to combat crime in other cities, including Chicago, Baltimore and Memphis. He deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles over the summer and as part of his law enforcement takeover in Washington, D.C.

Sortor, 27, who's a regular guest on Fox News and whose X profile has more than 1 million followers, was arrested Thursday night with two other people outside the city's Immigration and Customs Enforcement building. The Multnomah County District Attorney's Office said it was reviewing the case and would make a decision on whether to proceed with charges before Sortor's arraignment Monday.

What led to the arrests was not immediately clear. Portland police said they moved into the crowd to make arrests as fights broke out. They arrested Sorter and two others. 

All three were charged with second-degree disorderly conduct. Sorter was released Friday on his own recognizance, according to Multnomah County Sheriff's Office's online records. An email seeking comment from Sortor sent Friday went unanswered and no one answered phone numbers listed for him.

In a post on X on Friday morning, Sortor said his arrest proved that Portland Police are corrupt and controlled by “vioIent Antifa thugs who terrorize the streets.”

Portland famously erupted in more than 100 days of sustained, nightly protests in 2020 during the Black Lives Matter movement. In his first term, Trump sent federal law enforcement to the city to protect the U.S. District Courthouse in the heart of Portland after protests attracted thousands of people following George Floyd's murder by Minneapolis police. 

The presence of the federal agents further inflamed the situation, with federal officers repeatedly firing rubber bullets and teargassing protestors. Viral videos captured militarized federal officers, often unidentified, arresting people and hustling them into unmarked vehicles. 

At the same time, Portland police were unable to keep ahead of splinter groups of black-clad protesters who broke off and roamed the downtown area, at times breaking windows, spraying graffiti and setting small fires in moments that were also captured on video and shared widely on social media. 

A report by the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general found that while the federal government had legal authority to deploy the officers, many of them lacked the training and equipment needed to carry out the mission.

The tensions reached a peak in September 2020 when a self-identified member of the far-left anti-fascist movement fatally shot 39-year-old Aaron “Jay” Danielson in the chest. Danielson and a friend were seen heading downtown to protect a flag-waving caravan of Trump supporters shortly before the shooting.

The shooter, Michael Forest Reinoehl, was himself later shot and killed when he pulled a gun as a federal task force attempted to apprehend him near Lacey, Washington.

The situation in Portland is very different now.

There's been a sustained and low-level protest outside the ICE facility — far from the downtown clashes of 2020 — since Trump took office in January. Those protests flared in June, during the national protests surrounding Trump's military parade, but have rarely attracted more than a few dozen people in the past two months.

Trump has once more turned his attention to the city, calling Portland “war ravaged,” and a “war zone” that is “burning down” and like “living in hell.” But local officials have suggested that many of his claims and social media posts appear to rely on images from 2020. Under a new mayor, the city has reduced crime, and the downtown has seen a decrease in homeless encampments and increased foot traffic. 

Most violent crime around the country has actually declined in recent years, including in Portland, where a recent report from the Major Cities Chiefs Association found that homicides from January through June decreased by 51% this year compared to the same period in 2024.

City leaders have urged restraint and told residents not to “take the bait” this week after the announcement that the National Guard would be sent to Portland.

On Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Karin J. Immergut heard arguments on whether to block the deployment of National Guard troops in Portland, where they would defend federal buildings such as the ICE facility from vandalism.

Oregon sued to stop the deployment on Sept. 28 after Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek failed to persuade Trump to call off the deployment in a phone call a day earlier.

Immergut said she would rule later Friday or over the weekend.

Meanwhile, the National Guard troops — from communities not too far from Portland — were training on the Oregon Coast in anticipation of deployment.

Thursday's arrest of Sortor, however, likely means more federal law enforcement presence in Portland. 

In an X post, which reposted a video from the protest and a photo of Sortor being detained, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said there would be an immediate increase in federal resources to the city with enhanced Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement resources.

“This violence will end under @POTUS Trump,” McLaughlin wrote.

FIRST ON FOX: A new seven-figure ad in Virginia's governor's race is drawing comparisons to the infamous Willie Horton spot of 1988 amid record early voting in the Old Dominion State.The ad, produced by the American Principles Project, attacks Democrat Abigail Spanberger over transgender policies and warns of the dangers of biological men in women's spaces. It comes as early voting tops 146,000 ballots in the first week, more than twice the pace of 2021, according to data from the Virginia Public Access Project.

The spot points to Richard Cox, a Tier III sex offender in Arlington County who has been charged multiple times with exposing himself in girls' locker rooms. The ad says Spanberger's record and her opposition to Gov. Glenn Youngkin's guidelines for transgender students would let it happen again. It accuses her of putting radical ideology ahead of safety for young girls."The case of sexual deviant Richard Cox preying upon young girls in Virginia is enraging to any decent person – but not to Abigail Spanberger," Terry Schilling, President of the American Principles Project, told Fox News Digital. "She refuses to condemn Richard Cox at all."SPANBERGER DEFENDS ABORTION AD CRITICIZING SEARS AFTER BERNIE WARNS AGAINST HIGHLIGHTING ISSUE

"She's avoided answering any and all questions about it, and the answer is obvious because this situation is only possible because of Spanberger's radical transgender policy agenda. Cox has been a repeat offender for over 30 years. He was allowed to enter women's private spaces where little girls are vulnerable, and no one stopped him," Schilling added. "If Abigail Spanberger is elected governor of Virginia, she will repeal all protections for women in Virginia and put even more young girls in danger. The reason we are spending $1 million on this ad is because every Virginia voter should know that Abigail Spanberger will endanger their daughters."

APP has run similar ads in other battleground states, positioning itself as a defender of families and warning against policies it claims "confuse[s] young children about changing their gender." By airing the ad now, APP hopes to frame Spanberger as out of step with Virginia voters before Election Day.ELON MUSK WADES INTO VIRGINIA TRANSGENDER BATHROOM CLASH, SAYS DEM GOV CANDIDATE WRONGLY ‘BLAMING' TRUMP

The strategy echoes the famous Willie Horton ad of 1988 that linked Democrat Michael Dukakis to the convicted murderer who committed rape and assault while on weekend furlough from a Massachusetts prison. George H.W. Bush defeated Dukakis by seven points nationally, and the ad became a defining example of how the GOP can use crime to win races.

Spanberger has voted for the Equality Act in Congress and opposed Youngkin's guidelines, but local school boards control locker room access. Her campaign has tried to keep the focus on the economy and her own record in Washington. "Convicted sex offender Richard Cox is a predator who should be in jail — and that's exactly where he is," a spokeperson for Spanberger's campaign told Fox News Digital. "Abigail is a parent of three daughters in Virginia public schools and a former federal law enforcement officer who went after child predators. Nothing is more important to her than the safety of Virginia's kids. 

"As Governor, Abigail will work with state and local law enforcement officers to keep Virginia kids safe and make sure sex offenders are prevented from preying on children and prosecuted for their crimes."

Cox remains in custody at the Arlington County jail on multiple pending charges, according to the Arlington County Sheriff's Office inmate database."Abigail Spanberger's policies enabled Richard Cox to prey on women and girls. No amount of political damage control can erase that record," Schilling told Fox News Digital in response to the Spanberger campaign. "Spanberger is too dangerous to lead Virginia. As governor, Spanberger will repeal Gov. Youngkin's recent executive order barring males from female private spaces."Republicans argue that safety and cultural issues are resonating more deeply with parents across the state, particularly after Youngkin's win in 2021, which many linked to parental rights in education.

Polling shows Spanberger with a lead, but the numbers suggest a competitive race. A Washington Post Schar School poll taken in late September showed her at 55% to Republican nominee Winsome Earle-Sears at 43. With Republicans casting about half of the first week's early ballots, the race is one of the most-watched in the nation. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

More ads are expected as the campaign heats up and voters in Virginia send in record numbers of early ballots. The final weeks of the race will show whether the tough-on-crime playbook still rings true nearly four decades after Willie Horton. Early voting ends Nov. 1. The Earle-Sears campaign did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Friday that he ordered another strike on a small boat he accused of carrying drugs in the waters off Venezuela, expanding what the Trump administration has declared is an “armed conflict” with cartels.

In a post on social media, Hegseth asserted that the “vessel was trafficking narcotics” and those aboard were “narco-terrorists.” He said the strike killed four men but offered no details on who they were or what group they belonged to, following the U.S. designation of several Latin American cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. 

President Donald Trump said in his own social media post that the boat was “loaded with enough drugs to kill 25 TO 50 THOUSAND PEOPLE” and implied it was “entering American Territory” while off the coast of Venezuela. 

It is the fourth deadly strike in the Caribbean and the latest since revelations that Trump told lawmakers he was treating drug traffickers as unlawful combatants and military force was required to combat them. That assertion of presidential war powers sets the stage for expanded action and raises questions about how far the administration will go without sign-off from Congress.

“Blowing them up without knowing who's on the boat is a terrible policy, and it should end,” said Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a consistent and harsh critic of the U.S. strikes.

The Trump administration laid out its justification for the strikes in a memo obtained by The Associated Press this week.




“The President determined that the United States is in a non-international armed conflict with these designated terrorist organizations,” according to the memo sent to Congress. Trump directed the Pentagon to “conduct operations against them pursuant to the law of armed conflict,” the document says.

Sen. Jim Risch, Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the president had the authority to go after the cartels without further authorization from Congress under “his general powers under the Constitution as the commander in chief.”

“What could be a bigger defense of this country than keeping out this poison that's killing thousands of Americans every year?” Risch said Friday.

Paul said only Congress has the authority to declare war and characterized the memo as “a way to pretend like” the administration is notifying lawmakers with a justification for the strikes.

“If they want to declare war, come to Congress and say they want to declare war,” he told the AP. “But you can't just say it yourself and say, Oh, well, we sent them a note and now we're at war with unnamed people who we won't even identify before we kill.”

Hours after Hegseth announced the latest strike, Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez said the “warlike aggression” by the U.S. affects the greater Caribbean, not just Venezuela.

“We see it and feel it, as they murder our countries' citizens in summary extrajudicial executions,” she said during a conference in Venezuela's capital, Caracas, focused on colonialism in the West.

Meanwhile, President Nicolás Maduro did not explicitly mention the strikes, but he told conference attendees that his country is ready to defend itself. 

“Venezuela has the right to peace, to sovereignty, to existence, and no empire in this world can take it away,” he said. “And if it is necessary to move from an unarmed struggle to an armed struggle, this people will do so. … Colonialism no more.”

Colombian President Gustavo Petro, a leftist leader who has clashed with the Trump administration, accused the U.S. of committing “murder” and urged the victims' families to “join forces.”

“There are no narco-terrorists on the boats,” he posted on X after the strike was announced. “Drug traffickers live in the U.S., Europe and Dubai. On that boat are poor Caribbean youth.”

Video of Friday's strike posted online showed a small boat moving in open water when it suddenly explodes, with water splashing all around it. As the smoke from the explosion clears, the boat is visible, consumed with flames, floating motionless on the water.

With it, at least three of the strikes have now been carried out on vessels that U.S. officials said had originated from Venezuela. The strikes followed a buildup of U.S. maritime forces in the Caribbean unlike any seen in recent times. 

The Navy's presence in the region — eight warships with over 5,000 sailors and Marines — has been pretty stable for weeks, according to two defense officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing operations. 

In a post about the first strike last month, Trump claimed the vessel was carrying members of the Tren de Aragua gang. Posts about all the subsequent strikes, including Friday's, have not provided any details about what organizations have been targeted. The four strikes have killed 21 people, the administration says. 

Pentagon officials who briefed senators on the strikes this week could not provide a list of the designated terrorist organizations at the center of the conflict. 

Officials in the Pentagon, when asked for more details about the strike, referred The Associated Press back to Hegseth's post.

A federal judge in Tennessee ruled Friday that the foreign national from El Salvador, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, has shown a sufficient evidentiary basis to proceed with claims that his criminal prosecution was brought for “vindictive” and politically retaliatory reasons by the Trump administration.

U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw, an appointee of former President Barack Obama based in Nashville, granted Abrego Garcia's request for discovery and an evidentiary hearing, writing that the totality of events, including public comments by senior administration officials, raised a “realistic likelihood of vindictiveness.” The court stopped short of dismissing the charges but said more evidence must be considered before deciding whether to throw out the case entirely.

The ruling applies only to Abrego Garcia's criminal case in Tennessee, where he is charged with conspiracy and unlawful transportation of undocumented immigrants. It does not affect his separate immigration proceedings, where a Baltimore immigration judge this week rejected his final asylum bid, allowing his order of removal to remain in place pending appeal.

Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Salvadoran national and illegal immigrant, illegally entered the United States in 2012 and later settled in Maryland. He was deported in March in violation of a prior immigration court order that narrowly prohibited his removal to his home country. 

He returned to the United States in June after the Supreme Court sided with a judge who previously ruled the government should “facilitate” his return. On the day of his arrival, federal prosecutors indicted him on human smuggling charges based on a 2022 traffic stop. He has pleaded not guilty.

In court filings, federal prosecutors have accused Abrego Garcia of being a “known MS-13 gang member” who has “personally participated in violent crime, including murder.” They claim he trafficked women, children, firearms, and narcotics — and that he is the subject of an ongoing investigation into solicitation of child pornography. DHS has described him as a “serial domestic abuser” and “child predator,” noting a previous restraining order that was filed against him by his U.S.-citizen wife, who supports his effort to remain in the country.

Crenshaw noted that Trump administration and Justice Department officials “celebrated” the criminal charges in public statements and that Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche “strikingly” admitted in a television interview that the investigation began after a Maryland judge questioned the legality of Abrego Garcia's deportation.

“This could be direct evidence of vindictiveness,” Crenshaw wrote, adding that Blanche's “remarkable statements” may establish that the charges were motivated by retaliation for Abrego Garcia's legal challenge, “rather than a genuine desire to prosecute him for alleged criminal misconduct.”

Abrego Garcia's attorneys have long argued that DHS and DOJ officials targeted their client for successfully suing to return to the U.S. and embarrassed the administration's immigration enforcement strategy.

IMMIGRATION JUDGE ALLOWS REMOVAL ORDER TO STAND IN KILMAR ABREGO GARCIA CASE

“The government is attempting to use this case — and this Court — to punish Mr. Abrego for successfully fighting his unlawful removal,” they wrote in an earlier filing. “That is a constitutional violation of the most basic sort.”

Abrego Garcia remains in ICE custody in Pennsylvania pending the outcome of both the immigration and criminal proceedings, though the government has indicated he will be removed to a third country if he loses his appeal of his immigration case.

OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — The police chief of Nebraska's largest city acknowledged Friday that police nationwide are more likely to pull Black people out of their cars at gunpoint than other racial groups as Omaha grapples with growing outrage over champion boxer Terence “Bud” Crawford being ordered out of his car at gunpoint only hours after the city held a downtown celebration in his honor. 

“Quite frankly, that is generally a true statement. The number of stops are disproportionate. That is nationwide,” Police Chief Tobb Schmaderer said at a news conference to address an internal investigation into Crawford's traffic stop.

The police confrontation with Crawford, who is Black, has reignited long-simmering tensions between Omaha's Black community and its police force. Omaha Sen. Terrell McKinney, one of three Black state lawmakers in the Nebraska Legislature and a vocal critic of Omaha police and the state's justice system, said he was disappointed — but not surprised — by the police stop.

“I urge the people to keep speaking out and demanding real change boldly and unapologetically,” McKinney said in a Facebook post earlier this week. “Our lives are at risk, and we have endured oppression for far too long.”

According to a U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics' special report released in 2022, Black and Hispanic people were more likely than white people to experience the threat or use of force by police in 2020. Black people were also more likely to be shouted at by police than white people.

Schmaderer has long been an advocate of community policing that aims to build trust between officers and the public they patrol. He said Friday that he understands there is a lot of anger in the community over the treatment of Crawford — a favorite son of Omaha after making history by becoming the first male boxer to capture three unified division titles.

“We understand the importance of this traffic stop to our community, and the implications and the impression it has given out,” he said.

But he said a nearly completed internal investigation into the traffic stop shows the officers involved did not violate department policy.

According to their reports, the officers spotted a high-performance sedan without license plates pull out of a downtown parking garage around 1:30 a.m. Sunday and quickly accelerate to more than twice the 25 mph (40 kph) speed limit. The officers did not know Crawford was driving the car, Schmaderer said, before they pulled it over. Two officers approached it — one on the passenger side and another on the driver's side.

Schmaderer said the initial interaction was cordial, which he assessed through body camera footage. Crawford, who was driving, told the officer at his window that the car was new and “had gotten away from him.”

At that point, a member of Crawford's security team who was in the passenger seat told the officer at his window that he was carrying a legal handgun, Schmaderer said. Crawford, who was leaning over the car's console, told that officer he also had a legal firearm, but the officer at the driver's side window didn't hear that exchange, Schmaderer said.

That is when the officer on the driver's side spotted Crawford's gun on the floorboard by his feet, pulled his service weapon and ordered Crawford and three other people out. Schmaderer said Crawford and the others were handcuffed for about 10 minutes. Police confirmed all occupants of the vehicle were legally permitted to carry firearms and let them go after about 30 minutes, ticketing Crawford on suspicion of reckless driving.

Crawford's spokesperson said Friday that the boxer had no comment.

Schmaderer said he will not be sharing police video of the stop unless Crawford agrees to it.

“We don't have a fatality here. We don't have an officer-involved shooting, and it's generally not our protocol to release that footage under those circumstances,” he said.

Crawford's stop by police came after the city held a parade through downtown streets in Crawford's honor, followed by a party to celebrate his 38th birthday at a live music venue near where the stop occurred. 

The celebration came after Crawford earned the unified super middleweight championship with his unanimous decision victory over Canelo Alvarez on Sept. 13 in Las Vegas. Crawford is 42-0 with 31 knockouts.

The Grand Blanc Township Police Department released body camera video of officers responding to the shooting Sept. 28.

Police in Michigan released body camera video from officers who responded to the shooting at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, eventually killing the gunman.

Thomas Jacob Sanford is accused of killing four people and injuring eight at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, during Sunday service. Authorities say he rammed his truck into the building and opened fire, setting fire to the church while services were going on.

The Grand Blanc Township Police Department provided Fox News Digital with body camera video from officers who responded to the shooting. The video shows several officers running toward the church while several shots can be heard.

"Get on the ground," one law enforcement officer yells at Sanford.

"Shoot him," another officer can be heard saying. "Drop the gun now."

Several shots can be heard before Sanford is seen lifeless in the Church parking lot.

According to Fox 2, the first 911 call came in at 10:25 a.m. from a caller describing being shot in the stomach, and the first law enforcement officer arrived at 10:27 a.m.

Grand Blanc Police Chief William Renye said during a news conference that the video shows "what law enforcement is trained to do."

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in an update Monday that Sanford hated Mormons.

"Based on my conversations with the FBI director, all they know right now is this was an individual who hated people of the Mormon faith, and they are trying to understand more about this, how premeditated it was, how much planning went into it, whether he left a note. All of those questions have yet to be answered but certainly will be answered by the FBI," Leavitt told "Fox & Friends"

"Local police officers were on the ground of this scene within minutes and neutralized this shooter, no doubt saving lives, and they should be commended. Our police officers are heroes, and this president will always respect them and support them," Leavitt continued.

The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of "targeted" violence.

Trump advisor Corey Lewandowski responded to the news that Bad Bunny, who attacked ICE raids, would be performing at the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said immigration authorities will enforce the law at Super Bowl 60 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, before criticizing the NFL, which she said was "so weak."

Noem was speaking with Benny Johnson on "The Benny Show" when she was asked about Bad Bunny, the Puerto Rican reggaeton artist slated to perform in the halftime show and the presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Bad Bunny, a three-time Grammy winner whose real name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, said last month he would not perform in the United States during his upcoming tour due to concerns about potential ICE raids at the shows.

"I have the responsibility to make sure everybody who goes to the Super Bowl has the opportunity to enjoy it and to leave safely. That's what America's about," Noem told Johnson. "We'll be all over that place."

Noem said those attending big game should be law-abiding Americans "who love this country."

Johnson asked Noem about the decision to have Bad Bunny perform, given his views on ICE.

"They suck, and we'll win," Noem said of the NFL. "God will bless us, and we'll stand and be proud of ourselves at the end of the day. And they won't be able to sleep at night because they don't know what they believe.

"They're so weak. We'll fix it."

NOEM WARNS OF ‘UNPRECEDENTED' THREAT LEVEL FOR ICE AGENTS, BLAMES 'LIES' FROM DEMOCRATS

Earlier in the week, Trump advisor Corey Lewandowski warned ICE agents would be present at the game.

"There is nowhere you can provide safe haven to people who are in this country illegally," Lewandowski said on "The Benny Show." "Not the Super Bowl and nowhere else. We will find you and apprehend you and put you in a detention facility and deport you. Know that this is a very real situation under this administration, which is contrary to how it used to be."

Bad Bunny has frequently criticized ICE raids and ICE agents.

"But there was the issue of — like, f---ing ICE could be outside [my concert]. And it's something that we were talking about and very concerned about," he told i-D last month.

GRAND BLANC TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) — Police responding to a mass shooting at a Michigan church quickly encountered the gunman and killed him after repeatedly demanding, “Drop the gun! Drop it now!” according to bodycam video released Friday.

A 47-second video was released by police, five days after four people were killed inside The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc Township, near Flint. The gunman, Thomas “Jake” Sanford, also died.

Chief William Renye praised the “very courageous actions” of a state conservation officer and another local officer who ran to the sounds of gunfire.

“This is what law enforcement is trained to do, and this is how law enforcement should respond to these incidents,” Renye said.

The video shows only brief images from outside the chapel. Renye did not release video showing police near Sanford after he was killed, saying he was mindful that the Sanford family also has suffered.

The video shows police yelling, “Drop the gun! Drop the gun! Drop it now!” One of the officers tells the other officer, “I've got your back. ... Shoot him.”

Renye said at least eight shots were fired at Sanford. He said the entire incident lasted less than four minutes from the time of the first 911 call, not eight as initially reported.

Sanford had rammed his pickup truck into the chapel, repeatedly fired shots and set the building on fire last Sunday. Besides the deaths, eight people were injured.

Sanford's friends said he had repeatedly expressed hatred for the Mormon church, as it is commonly called.




Four white crosses with blue hearts were set up down the street from the ruins of the church property. Each cross has the name of someone who died: Craig Hayden, William “Pat” Howard, John Bond and Thelma Armstrong. Flower bouquets were placed there, and votive candles burned Friday.

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem said Friday she and her staff were denied entry to a government building in a Chicago suburb, where they attempted to stop for a "bathroom break" as federal agents clashed with protesters outside a nearby immigration facility.

In a post on X, Noem said her team was denied access to the Village of Broadview Municipal Building, located about 12 miles west of downtown Chicago, and blasted Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker's administration for its treatment of federal agents.

"My team and I were just blocked from accessing the Village of Broadview Municipal Building in Illinois," Noem said. "We were stopping for a quick bathroom break. This is a public building. The Village of Broadview receives at least $1 million in federal funding every year. This is how JB Pritzker and his cronies treat our law enforcement. Absolutely shameful."

A video of the encounter shows Noem approaching the building with her staff as one person asks through the door, "Can we use your restroom?"

Someone inside can be heard responding, "No you cannot!" before Noem calmly replies, "OK, all right, thank you," and walks away.

Village officials said Noem showed up unannounced Friday morning seeking a meeting with Mayor Katrina Thompson, who was out of the building at the time.

"Since DHS Secretary Kristi Noem appeared this morning, unannounced, at Broadview's Village Hall asking for a meeting while Mayor Katrina Thompson was out of the building, the mayor returned her visit," Village of Broadview spokesperson David Ormsby said in a statement. 

"Mayor Thompson went to the ICE center, accompanied by the Broadview Police Chief Thomas, and officers, to ask for the illegal fence to be dismantled. The mayor was told by agents at the gate the secretary was unavailable to meet."

However, DHS officials insisted the stop was not about a meeting at all.

"She didn't ask for a meeting. She asked to use the restroom. This is insane," DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News.

The bathroom dispute came as tensions flared outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) processing facility in Broadview, where more than a dozen people were arrested by federal agents during demonstrations. Fox News observed agents firing pepper balls, tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds blocking federal operations.

Earlier Friday, Gov. Pritzker accused Noem of overseeing federal enforcement tactics that he said had violated rights and traumatized families in Illinois. He also said she should "no longer be able to step foot inside the State of Illinois without any form of public accountability."

"Last time when the secretary was here, she snuck in during the early morning to film social media videos and fled before sunrise," Pritzker's office said. "It's been nearly 45 days since Secretary Noem has held an official press conference, so it's time she faces the public and takes questions from the press to be held accountable for the Trump administration's gross misconduct. 

"Illinois is not a photo opportunity or war zone, it's a sovereign state where our people deserve rights, respect and answers."

McLaughlin snapped back on behalf of DHS, accusing Pritzker of failing to protect Illinois residents from violent offenders.

"Grow up and start protecting the people of your own state," McLaughlin said in a statement. "Federal law enforcement has to be here because JB Pritzker refuses to do his job and has allowed violent illegal alien criminals to terrorize Illinois communities for years."

The Village of Broadview did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares says a Democratic prosecutor 'failed to do his job' against a transgender sex offender on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

Virginia Democratic attorney general candidate Jay Jones once remarked on shooting the Virginia House speaker in texts with another lawmaker, the latest example of charged political rhetoric some have called the politics of "rage."

Texts obtained by Fox News Digital Friday showed an August 2022 conversation between Jones — then a recently departed delegate from Norfolk — and another lawmaker after the death of Del. Joe Johnson, D-Bristol, at age 90.

"Hence the glowing tributes from the Rs. Damn, that (message) was for Mark," Jones texted Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chester.

At the time, several House Republicans — including leadership — offered eulogizing words for Johnson, who had been known as an aisle-crossing, friendly moderate. One of those who had kind words for Johnson was then-House Speaker Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah.

Jones told Coyner that Johnson "leaked everything to your [Republican] caucus. It's why Gilbert gave him such a glowing tribute."

"If those guys die before me, I will go to their funerals to piss on their graves," he continued. "Send them out awash in something."

A text message from Jay Jones to Del. Carrie Coyner. 

At that point, Coyner appeared to attempt to rein in the conversation, texting, "Jay Jones."

But Jones continued, adding, "Three people, two bullets. Gilbert, Hitler and Pol Pot. Gilbert gets two bullets to the head."

The future attorney general candidate was not yet finished condemning the House leader.

"Spoiler: put Gilbert in the crew with the two worst people you know and he receives both bullets every time," he wrote.

Coyner tried again to end the conversation: "Jay. Please stop."

"Lol. OK, OK," he replied.

A source familiar with the situation told Fox News Digital that, around that point, Jones and Coyner had a telephone conversation, which was followed by Jones trying to lighten the mood.

"I genuinely was [asking questions]. I wasn't attacking you. I was trying to understand your logic."

Coyner disagreed, to which Jones replied, "Yes, I've told you this before. Only when people feel pain personally do they move on policy."

In another message to Coyner, Jones considered whether Gilbert and his wife Jennifer were "breeding little fascists."

A spokesperson for Coyner's campaign confirmed the veracity of the texts first reported by National Review, saying they were "disturbing and disqualifying for anyone who wants to seek public office."

"Jay Jones wished violence on the children of a colleague and joked about shooting Todd Gilbert. It's disgusting and unbecoming of any public official," the spokesperson said. 

Gilbert recently resigned from Richmond to accept President Donald Trump's nomination as U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Virginia. He has since left that post, according to reports.

Jones' comments created a firestorm Friday evening, with another state lawmaker recently subjected to a death threat condemning Jones.

Del. Geary Higgins, R-Lovettsville, said Democrats continue to amp up violent rhetoric that has gotten people hurt.

PRITZKER SWIFTLY FACT-CHECKED AFTER CLAIMING HE NEVER DERIDED GOP WITH DICTATORSHIP COMPARISON: ‘PATHOLOGICAL'

"They shot the president. They killed Charlie Kirk. They threatened to kill Kim Taylor. They said they'd kill me at my next rally, then my kids. Now we learn Jay Jones repeatedly said he wanted to kill Speaker Todd Gilbert. Is this what "letting your rage fuel you" looks like?" he said, referring to a widely-condemned remark by Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger unrelated to Jones, specifically.

Spanberger condemned her fellow Democrat, saying in a statement that she spoke "frankly" with Jones after the texts surfaced about her "disgust" for what he had said.

"I will always condemn violent language in our politics," Spanberger said.

A source familiar with the situation told Fox News Digital Jones initially had accidentally texted Coyner, who later made Gilbert aware of the Democrat's invective.

When reached by Fox News Digital, Jones also did not deny the messages were his and blamed his opponent for allegedly planting stories and then criticized Republicans.

"Like all people, I've sent text messages that I regret, and I believe that violent rhetoric has no place in our politics," Jones said.

"Let's be clear about what is happening in the attorney general race right now: Jason Miyares is dropping smears through Trump-controlled media organizations to assault my character and rescue his desperate campaign.

"This is a strategy that ensures Jason Miyares will continue to be accountable to Donald Trump, not the people of Virginia. This race is about whether Trump can control Virginia or Virginians control Virginia."

A source familiar with Gilbert told Fox News Digital he has no comment on the matter.

A public school district in Des Moines, Iowa, sued a consulting firm on Friday for “failing to properly vet” a former superintendent detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement last week.

The lawsuit, filed by the Des Moines Public Schools Board in state court, blames JG Consulting for facilitating the 2022-2023 superintendent search that led to the hiring of Ian Roberts, an illegal immigrant from Guyana with an extensive criminal record.

The school board alleges the firm breached an executive search agreement by neglecting to disclose “all known information of a positive or negative nature regarding any candidate,” namely, Roberts.

“JG Consulting materially breached the Agreement by, among other things, failing to properly vet Roberts and by referring Roberts as a candidate when he could not lawfully hold the position,” the lawsuit states.

The Washington Examiner contacted JG Consulting for comment on the lawsuit.

Jackie Norris, chairwoman of the school board, announced the legal action during a Friday meeting. She said the consulting firm should have done a better background check on Roberts, considering public reporting has unearthed his criminal history and immigration status since his arrest.

“It's clear that people are identifying and finding information in a matter of hours,” Norris said. “And so it's probably something that they should have caught, and that was our expectation.”

The lawsuit says the district has sustained damages and reputational harm as a result of the former superintendent's arrest and the backlash that came with it.

“We are pursuing legal action as allowed by law. This is about accountability, taxpayer dollars, and we are seeking accountability,” Norris added. “As the facts revealed themselves over the past several days, it was crystal clear that the search firm did not do its job.”

Last Friday, ICE detained Roberts and confiscated his loaded handgun, fixed-blade hunting knife, and $3,000 in cash found in his vehicle. He had lived and worked in the United States illegally without any work authorization for years.

Roberts was the superintendent from July 2023 until his resignation on Tuesday. Two days later, the Department of Justice charged him as an illegal immigrant in possession of firearms.

His rap sheet includes multiple charges related to firearms violations, criminal possession of narcotics, and reckless driving over the past 30 years, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

EX-IOWA SUPERINTENDENT FEDERALLY CHARGED AFTER ICE ARREST

“Ian Andre Roberts, a criminal illegal alien with multiple weapons charges and a drug trafficking charge, should have never been able to work around children,” DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said.

“When ICE officers arrested this Superintendent, he was in possession of an illegal handgun, a hunting knife, and nearly $3,000 in cash,” she added. “This criminal illegal alien is now in U.S. Marshals custody and facing charges for being an illegal alien in possession of a firearms. Under Secretary Noem, ICE will continue to arrest the worst of the worst and put the safety of America's children FIRST.”

PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Five years after protests roiled Portland, Oregon, the city known for its history of civil disobedience is again at the center of a political maelstrom as it braces for the arrival of federal troops being deployed by President Donald Trump.

Months of demonstrations outside Portland's immigration detention facility have escalated since Trump said last week he was sending federal troops to the city, which he described as “War ravaged.” Police made a few arrests late Thursday after fights broke out in the crowd, including of conservative influencer Nick Sortor on a disorderly conduct charge.

On Friday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the agency would send additional federal agents and the Justice Department was launching a civil rights investigation into the circumstances surrounding Sortor's arrest, and whether the Portland Police Bureau engages in viewpoint discrimination.

City leaders adamantly deny any such discrimination and said they don't need the National Guard to help handle the single block outside the ICE facility where the protests have occurred.

“Last night, the arrests that we made, we made based upon probable cause, not based upon individuals,” Police Chief Bob Day told a news conference Friday. “There is no political bias associated with our enforcement.”

Meanwhile, a federal judge heard arguments — but did not immediately rule — on whether to temporarily block Trump's call-up of 200 Oregon National Guard members, which the administration said is needed to protect the ICE facility and other federal buildings.

The escalation of federal law enforcement in Portland, population 636,000 and Oregon's largest city, follows similar crackdowns to combat crime in other cities, including Chicago, Baltimore and Memphis. He deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles over the summer and as part of his law enforcement takeover in Washington, D.C.

Sortor, 27, who's a regular guest on Fox News and whose X profile has more than 1 million followers, was arrested Thursday night with two other people outside the city's Immigration and Customs Enforcement building. The Multnomah County District Attorney's Office said it was reviewing the case and would make a decision on whether to proceed with charges before Sortor's arraignment Monday.

What led to the arrests was not immediately clear. Portland police said they moved into the crowd to make arrests as fights broke out. They arrested Sorter and two others. 

All three were charged with second-degree disorderly conduct. Sorter was released Friday on his own recognizance, according to Multnomah County Sheriff's Office's online records. An email seeking comment from Sortor sent Friday went unanswered and no one answered phone numbers listed for him.

In a post on X on Friday morning, Sortor said his arrest proved that Portland Police are corrupt and controlled by “vioIent Antifa thugs who terrorize the streets.”

Portland famously erupted in more than 100 days of sustained, nightly protests in 2020 during the Black Lives Matter movement. In his first term, Trump sent federal law enforcement to the city to protect the U.S. District Courthouse in the heart of Portland after protests attracted thousands of people following George Floyd's murder by Minneapolis police. 

The presence of the federal agents further inflamed the situation, with federal officers repeatedly firing rubber bullets and teargassing protestors. Viral videos captured militarized federal officers, often unidentified, arresting people and hustling them into unmarked vehicles. 

At the same time, Portland police were unable to keep ahead of splinter groups of black-clad protesters who broke off and roamed the downtown area, at times breaking windows, spraying graffiti and setting small fires in moments that were also captured on video and shared widely on social media. 

A report by the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general found that while the federal government had legal authority to deploy the officers, many of them lacked the training and equipment needed to carry out the mission.

The tensions reached a peak in September 2020 when a self-identified member of the far-left anti-fascist movement fatally shot 39-year-old Aaron “Jay” Danielson in the chest. Danielson and a friend were seen heading downtown to protect a flag-waving caravan of Trump supporters shortly before the shooting.

The shooter, Michael Forest Reinoehl, was himself later shot and killed when he pulled a gun as a federal task force attempted to apprehend him near Lacey, Washington.

The situation in Portland is very different now.

There's been a sustained and low-level protest outside the ICE facility — far from the downtown clashes of 2020 — since Trump took office in January. Those protests flared in June, during the national protests surrounding Trump's military parade, but have rarely attracted more than a few dozen people in the past two months.

Trump has once more turned his attention to the city, calling Portland “war ravaged,” and a “war zone” that is “burning down” and like “living in hell.” But local officials have suggested that many of his claims and social media posts appear to rely on images from 2020. Under a new mayor, the city has reduced crime, and the downtown has seen a decrease in homeless encampments and increased foot traffic. 

Most violent crime around the country has actually declined in recent years, including in Portland, where a recent report from the Major Cities Chiefs Association found that homicides from January through June decreased by 51% this year compared to the same period in 2024.

City leaders have urged restraint and told residents not to “take the bait” this week after the announcement that the National Guard would be sent to Portland.

On Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Karin J. Immergut heard arguments on whether to block the deployment of National Guard troops in Portland, where they would defend federal buildings such as the ICE facility from vandalism.

Oregon sued to stop the deployment on Sept. 28 after Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek failed to persuade Trump to call off the deployment in a phone call a day earlier.

Immergut said she would rule later Friday or over the weekend.

Meanwhile, the National Guard troops — from communities not too far from Portland — were training on the Oregon Coast in anticipation of deployment.

Thursday's arrest of Sortor, however, likely means more federal law enforcement presence in Portland. 

In an X post, which reposted a video from the protest and a photo of Sortor being detained, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said there would be an immediate increase in federal resources to the city with enhanced Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement resources.

“This violence will end under @POTUS Trump,” McLaughlin wrote.

Senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram and Fox News contributor Byron York join 'America Reports' to discuss the government shutdown's impact on the nation.

Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is sending a pointed signal to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., as the 2025 government shutdown is poised to enter a second week.

The leader of the House of Representatives canceled chamber activities for next week, effectively directing lawmakers to remain in their home districts until at least Oct. 14.

Johnson appears to be raising the stakes on Senate Democrats, who keep refusing the GOP's plan to fund government agencies on a short-term basis in favor of making demands on healthcare that Republicans are calling unreasonable.

Originally, the House had been slated to return to a regular legislative schedule on Oct. 7. The full House was last in session on Sept. 19.

Johnson warned earlier on Friday that the House may not return until Schumer and Democrats agreed with Republicans' bill.

"We passed it, and it's been rejected by the Senate," the House speaker told reporters during a news conference. "So the House will come back into session and do its work as soon as Chuck Schumer allows us to reopen the government. That's plain and simple."

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., told Fox News Digital during his own Friday news conference that he would summon his Democratic caucus back into D.C. next week whether Republicans were there or not.

Meanwhile, two sources told Fox News Digital earlier on Friday that it was one of several strategies that House GOP leaders were considering, but were waiting to see how the Senate's Friday afternoon vote played out.

It was the fourth time Senate Democrats rejected the GOP's funding plan, a mostly flat extension of fiscal year (FY) 2025 government funding levels. The measure, called a continuing resolution (CR), would also include $88 million in security funding for lawmakers, the White House and the judicial branch — which has bipartisan support.

But Democrats in the House and Senate were infuriated by being sidelined in federal funding talks. 

They have been pushing for an extension of Obamacare subsidies enhanced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Those enhancements would expire by the end of 2025 without congressional action.

Democrats have also introduced a counter-proposal for a CR that would keep the government funded through Oct. 31 while reversing the GOP's cuts to Medicaid made in their "One Big, Beautiful Bill."

GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN SPARKS GOP PLAN TO PENALIZE LAWMAKERS WITH NEW SALARY TAX

The counter-proposal would have also restored federal funding to NPR and PBS that was cut by the Trump administration earlier this year.

Republicans have panned that plan as a non-starter full of partisan demands, while pointing out that Democrats have voted for a "clean" measure similar to the GOP proposal 13 times during former President Joe Biden's time in office.

Canceling next week's House votes also puts off the probability that lawmakers would have to vote on making the Department of Justice release even more files related to Jeffrey Epstein.

Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., needed just one more person to sign onto a petition aimed at forcing a vote on the Epstein files — a signature they would have gotten if Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz., was sworn in next week following her special election victory.

House GOP leaders have panned that petition as unserious and superfluous, having already directed the House Oversight Committee to investigate the DOJ's handling of Epstein's case.

Johnson told Fox News Digital earlier this week that he was concerned the bipartisan measure was written in a way that it would not protect sensitive information regarding Epstein's victims.

When asked about Johnson's move during his own Friday news conference, Schumer told reporters, "Johnson and the House Republicans care more about protecting the Epstein files than protecting the American people."

Michel Picaud, president of Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris, shares updates on the restoration of the Notre Dame Cathedral in France five years after a fire shut the site down.

The world-renowned Eiffel Tower in Paris shut its doors on locals and international tourists on Thursday amid a nationwide strike.

As crowds of protesters marched from Place d'Italie toward the Eiffel Tower, the tower's management announced in a statement that the landmark was closed to visitors due to the strike, according to The Associated Press.

Thousands of workers, retirees and students took to the streets of more than 200 towns and cities across France on Thursday, protesting spending cuts and demanding higher taxes on France's wealthy.

Nearly 200,000 people are protesting across the country, including 24,000 in Paris, according to the French Interior Ministry.

"This is the first time that there are three days of strikes and protests in a month without a government or budget," said Sophie Binet, head of the CGT, one of France's largest and most influential trade unions, per AP. 

"It shows the level of social anger."

The U.S. Embassy in France issued an alert to travelers visiting Paris Sept. 18.

"Avoid the areas of the demonstrations, exercise caution if unexpectedly in the vicinity of large gatherings or protests, [and] monitor schedules with local and national transportation providers," the Embassy advised.

In 2024, the tower welcomed 6.3 million visitors, according to the Société d'Exploitation de la Tour Eiffel, which operates the tower.

About 16,500 tourists visit the tower daily, according to Guide to Paris.

Last year, the tower was shut down between Feb. 19-24 due to a union employee strike. 

Employees argued that Paris City Hall had underestimated the cost of the planned maintenance ahead of the 2024 Summer Olympics, Reuters reported at the time.

In June, the Louvre, the world's largest art museum located in Paris, also closed its doors to visitors due to an employee strike, Fox News Digital reported at the time. 

Overtourism sparked by Leonardo da Vinci's "Mona Lisa" may have in part prompted the strike, with 20,000 people per day crowding the famous painting.

The U.K.'s chief rabbi said Friday that the deadly attack at a synagogue in Manchester was “inevitable” given the “deep tone of Jew hatred on the streets” in Britain, and called on the government to do more to protect its citizens.

At a vigil held in Manchester to pay tribute to those who were killed at a synagogue on the holiest day of the Jewish year, Rabbi Daniel Walker said the “pain is very raw”.

MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Hundreds of mourners gathered in wind and rain Friday for a vigil that combined grief and defiance in the remembrance of two men who were killed when a knife-wielding assailant attacked their synagogue in the English city of Manchester.

Standing behind the police cordon that still surrounds the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in the city's Crumpsall neighborhood, the mourners said they felt forgotten by a society that has allowed antisemitism in the U.K. to grow unchallenged over the last two years.

Politicians and other leaders have failed to reject anti-Jewish speech or protect Jews from hate crimes, they said.

“We are Jews, but we are English. We have lived in Manchester for 150 years. We belong here,” Simon Burton, who works in sales, told The Associated Press. “We feel that, as a community, we are not always listened to. We feel let down.”

On Thursday, as people gathered at the synagogue to celebrate Yom Kippur, the most sacred day of the Jewish calendar, the attacker drove his car into people outside the building and stabbed one person to death. A second man appears to have been inadvertently shot by police who confronted the assailant, police said Friday. Three other people were seriously injured.




Authorities declared the assault an act of terrorism, though they are still investigating what motivated the attacker, who was identified as a naturalized British citizen of Syrian descent. He was shot dead by police.

“Right now, our hearts are shattered,” Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis said Friday. “What transpired yesterday was an awful blow to us, something which actually we were fearing might happen because of the buildup to this action.”

As evidence of the climate of intolerance that has been allowed to fester in Britain, some people pointed to pro-Palestinian protests in London that went ahead Thursday night, even as Jews around the country grieved over the deaths in Manchester.

Police in London urged organizers to call off a demonstration planned for Saturday to oppose the government's decision to ban the group Palestine Action, which was labeled a terrorist organization after its members attacked Israeli defense contractors and Royal Air Force aircraft over support for the war in Gaza.

Organizers rejected the request.

“Canceling peaceful protests lets terror win,” the group said in a statement.

Protests and counter-protests have gripped cities across Britain since the Hamas-led attack on Israel almost two years ago.

Pro-Palestinian marches have become louder and angrier amid criticism of Israel's offensive in Gaza. Some Jews say they feel threatened by chants such as “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.” The protests have been largely peaceful.

The Israeli prime minister and his supporters have frequently accused critics of Israel or its conduct of the war in Gaza of antisemitism. Israel's detractors see it as an attempt to stifle even legitimate criticism.

The number of antisemitic incidents reported across the U.K. has soared since the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas on Israel, according to the Community Security Trust, which works to protect the Jewish community. The group recorded 1,521 antisemitic incidents in the first half of this year, up from 965 in the same period of 2023.

But in Crumpsall, neighbors of all faiths banded together Friday to support one another, focused on their mutual disgust at the violence inflicted on their multicultural community during seven minutes on Thursday morning.

“There's no room for this,” said Sham Raja, a local businessman. “The Jewish community, obviously, they are very upset at what's happened, and there's no room for the antisemitic. And also as a British Muslim, I fully support the Jewish community and work with them shoulder to shoulder.”

Josh Aronson, a Jewish man who lives near the synagogue, said people of all faiths turned out to show their solidarity.

“Yesterday I had a story that … one of my neighbors who's Muslim and another neighbor who's Christian, and myself, we hugged together and it's like so they can be in this community,” he said.

But the air of solidarity was shattered during Friday's vigil, when Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy was introduced to the crowd. Lammy was Britain's foreign secretary until a few weeks ago and is seen as the architect of the government's decision to criticize the Israeli offensive in Gaza and recognize a Palestinian state.

Lammy was greeted with shouts of “not today” and “shame on you.”

Mark Adlestone, chair of the Jewish Representative Council in Greater Manchester, eventually quieted the crowd, saying, “All right, we've heard enough. We know how you feel.”

Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who visited the synagogue Friday, said the attack was designed to “inflict fear” on the Jewish community.

Jews in Manchester seem determined to carry on. Orthodox Jews hurried to do their shopping ahead of the Sabbath, all but tripping over the journalists seeking their views. Were they afraid? Did they see this coming?

Yes, there was grief for those that were lost. Yes, there was fear of rising antisemitism. But there was also defiance.

“We're not going to cower away,” Issaac Friedlander said. “We're not going to hide. ... We're going to carry on with our lives.”

This version has been changed to correct that the pro-Palestinian protests in London were Thursday night, not Wednesday night.

Fox News national correspondent Griff Jenkins reports on the arrest of an illegal immigrant with a violent history. The ‘Outnumbered' co-hosts react and discuss the political rhetoric surrounding ICE enforcement.

The former superintendent of Iowa's largest school district, who was living and working in the United States illegally, has an extensive criminal history, including drug and weapons possession, the Department of Homeland Security said Friday.

Ian Roberts resigned from the Des Moines Public Schools (DMPS) district this week following his arrest by immigration authorities. He was taken into custody after a short car chase and is charged with being an illegal alien in possession of firearms, authorities said.

"Ian Andre Roberts, a criminal illegal alien with multiple weapons charges and a drug trafficking charge, should have never been able to work around children," said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. "When ICE officers arrested this superintendent, he was in possession of an illegal handgun, a hunting knife, and nearly $3,000 in cash."

ILLEGAL ALIEN ARRESTED BY ICE FOUND REGISTERED AS ACTIVE DEMOCRAT VOTER IN BLUE STATE

"This criminal illegal alien is now in U.S. Marshals custody and facing charges for being an illegal alien in possession of firearms. Under Secretary Noem, ICE will continue to arrest the worst of the worst and put the safety of America's children FIRST," she added.

Roberts' criminal record includes a range of offenses, including a 1996 charge for possession of narcotics with intent to sell, criminal possession of narcotics, criminal possession of a forged instrument and possession of a forgery device in New York.

In 1998, Roberts, 54, a native of Guyana, was charged with third-degree unauthorized use of a vehicle in Queens, New York. That case was dismissed on July 6, 1999. He also has a 2012 conviction for reckless driving, unsafe operation, and speeding in Maryland.

In 2020, Roberts was charged with second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, third-degree criminal possession of a weapon, and fourth-degree weapon charges. A document from Feb. 4, 2020, indicates that the second-degree criminal possession charge was inchoate.

In addition, Roberts' immigration history includes two visas, four Green Card applications and subsequent denials, and several trips abroad, authorities said. He entered the U.S. through John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York on a B-2 non-immigrant visa and was classified as a visitor for pleasure.

He left the U.S. on an unknown date but returned before his 1996 arrest for narcotics possession. He re-entered the U.S. through San Francisco in 1999 on a student visa, which expired in March 2004, DHS said. He left and then re-entered the U.S. at least two other times on a student visa.

Roberts also filed multiple green card applications, all of which were rejected. In 2004, an immigration judge in Texas ordered him to be deported.

President and CEO of Focus on the Family Jim Daly joins Fox News Digital to share the real-world implications for the ministry after the Southern Poverty Law Center designated it a hate group last week.

FBI Director Kash Patel announced Friday the agency has "terminated" all ties with the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), a left-leaning nonprofit organization known for its "hate map" and designating groups it views as extremist, including Turning Point USA.

The nonprofit, founded in 1971, originally focused on civil rights legal advocacy. However, in recent years, critics claim it has become highly partisan, targeting conservatives and faith-based organizations alongside actual hate groups.

"The Southern Poverty Law Center long ago abandoned civil rights work and turned into a partisan smear machine," Patel wrote in an announcement on X. "Their so-called ‘hate map' has been used to defame mainstream Americans and even inspired violence. That disgraceful record makes them unfit for any FBI partnership."

PATEL CUTS TIES COMEY'S FBI MADE WITH ADL AS ORGANIZATION FACES BACKLASH FOR TPUSA CRITICISM

Patel said during the FBI's Anti-Christian Bias Panel in April, he made it clear that the agency will "never rely on politicized or agenda-driven intelligence from outside groups and certainly not from the SPLC."

The director's announcement comes less than a month after Turning Point USA (TPUSA) founder Charlie Kirk was assassinated while speaking at Utah Valley University Sept. 10, killing the 31-year-old father of two.

In May, the SPLC listed TPUSA in its "hate and extremism" report, calling it a "hard-right organization with links to Southern Poverty Law Center-identified hard-right extremists."

SCHIFF: PATEL'S FBI LEADERSHIP REPLACED EXPERTISE WITH 'RABID PARTISANSHIP'

"Turning Point USA's primary strategy is sowing and exploiting fear that white Christian supremacy is under attack by nefarious actors, including immigrants, the LGBTQ+ community and civil rights activists," the SPLC wrote in a May 22 case study. "Turning Point USA's effort to sow fear and division to enforce social hierarchies rooted in supremacism is emblematic of the hard right's broader political project to destroy our foundational democratic principles and institutions."

On Thursday, TPUSA spokesman Andrew Kolvet shared one of Kirk's X posts from Feb. 10, 2023, in which he described the SPLC as a hate group, saying, "There's a Charlie tweet for everything." 

"What's happening right now to the ADL and SPLC is critically important and deadly serious," Kolvet wrote in another post Thursday, sharing a photo of the May SPLC case study. "They are both part of an ecosystem leveraged by radical left vigilantes to dehumanize conservatives and stoke political violence. They provide the sheen of legitimacy for the left's violent foot soldiers."

Kirk also posted about the topic on May 25, denouncing the SPLC for comparing TPUSA to extremist groups like the KKK and arguing the SPLC is a corrupt, money-driven organization that raises funds by stoking fear.

"Their game plan? Scare financial institutions into debanking us, pressure schools to cancel us, and demonize us so some unhinged lunatic feels justified targeting us," Kirk wrote. "Remember the Family Research Council? An SPLC-inspired gunman went after them. They'd love nothing more than to see TPUSA in the crosshairs. … Being on their list is a badge of honor. It means they're terrified that we're so effective. Keep crying, SPLC — America's done with your scam."

'MOST TRANSPARENT' FBI EVER: PATEL UPDATES SENATE ON KIRK ASSASSINATION PROBE

Kolvet highlighted that on Sept. 9, the day before Kirk's murder, the SPLC published a newsletter "directly attacking Charlie."

"Did these contribute to the assassin's motive?" Kolvet wrote Thursday. "We may never know, but the swirl of extremist propaganda certainly played a role. The SPLC has been credibly accused of corruption, mishandling of donations, union-busting, and covering up of sexual assault by senior leadership, all while sitting on nearly $1 billion in reserves and being based in red Alabama. These are legitimate predicates for investigation. Those should happen immediately.

"The influence of the ADL and SPLC must be completely purged from any serious company, org, and agency. Companies like PayPal which still rely on these disgraced orgs should be the focus of future boycotts if they insist on continuing their association."

Elon Musk reacted to Kolvet's post with a simple, "Exactly."

Patel's announcement about the FBI cutting ties with the SPLC came just hours after Kolvet's post.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has accused the independent watchdog for the Pentagon of being “weaponized” and says he's overhauling the inspector general's office, upending the way that service members report abuse and other problems in the ranks.

Hegseth unveiled the plans during a speech at an unusual gathering of hundreds of top military leaders this week. He also signed a memo ordering the inspector general to identify anyone who makes a complaint instead of letting them be anonymous, to dismiss any complaints the inspector general deems “non-credible,” and to set new, tighter timelines for complaints to be filed and investigations to be completed. 

Along with a decree stating that the military's policy on “hazing, bullying, and harassment is overly broad,” Hegseth's directives have raised concerns among advocates and experts who say the changes would undo years of progress that have helped protect women and minorities from abuse and would shutter avenues to file legitimate complaints. 

It is part of a broader push by the Trump administration to radically reshape the community of inspectors general tasked with rooting out waste, fraud and abuse at government agencies. More than a dozen watchdogs were fired in January amid a larger dismantling of public integrity guardrails since President Donald Trump took office.




The changes are necessary to fix a process that “has been weaponized — putting complainers, ideologues and poor performers in the driver's seat,” Hegseth told military leaders Tuesday, without offering evidence.

Hegseth is overhauling the office as he himself is under investigation by the inspector general over his use of the Signal messaging app, where he shared sensitive information about military strikes in a group chat that inadvertently included a journalist. He also shared the information in other chats that included his wife and brother.

Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson told reporters in August that Hegseth had made a statement as part of that investigation — one of the last steps in the process.

Don Christensen, a former chief prosecutor for the Air Force and a Virginia-based attorney who often represents people who file complaints with the inspector general, questioned the need for Hegseth's directive.

“This is based upon people that he hangs out with complaining about the process versus any kind of study or data that shows that the IG takes too long or there's this problem with serial complainers,” Christensen said. He added, “I don't know of any data that shows there's a crisis of serial complaints.”

Rachel VanLandingham, a former Air Force lawyer and military justice advocate, said she worries the changes will have a major chilling effect on troops coming forward to report sexual harassment, bullying and racism.

She noted that by eliminating anonymous reporting, Hegseth is planning to shut down a process that has been “proven to bring to light significant issues that affect morale and discipline within units.”

“Survey after survey after survey has shown that service members are afraid of their own command chain, and when they're afraid of their own command chain, problems go on unsolved,” she said.

Despite years of messaging and establishing specialized response teams, the military has continued to struggle with sexual assault and violence toward women.

In a recent case, Army Spc. Vanessa Guillen's dismembered remains were discovered after she had been missing for more than two months from Fort Hood in Texas in 2020. The killing sparked a movement of women speaking out about sexual abuse in the military and led to changes in how they can report it.

An Army investigation later found that, among other issues, there was a climate that tolerated sexual harassment and assault, and that there was a significant lack of confidence in the command chain, and therefore reluctance to report abusive behavior.

In his speech this week, Hegseth seemed to anticipate criticism of his changes and stressed to the assembled military brass that “of course, being a racist has been illegal in our formation since 1948 — the same goes for sexual harassment — both are wrong and illegal.” He said “those kinds of infractions will be ruthlessly enforced.”

While VanLandingham acknowledged Hegseth's position, she said he is making “changes to systems that have been shown to help reduce sexual harassment and sexual assault” and were created in response to widespread systemic racial and sexual discrimination and harassment.

Hegseth's memo also pointedly noted that an article of the Uniform Code of Military Justice — the legal code that governs military personnel — prohibits false statements and that violators “will be held appropriately accountable.”

Both Christiansen and VanLandingham said such wording will almost certainly discourage people from reporting concerns and complaints.

“The people who are coming forward are taking a huge risk for their career already, and now he's making it worse by putting a target on their back,” Christensen said.

VanLandingham added: “That's not how you instill confidence in a system to be able to report things that absolutely need to be reported.”

            The Department of Homeland Security is preparing to offer unaccompanied migrant teenagers in the United States the option to voluntarily leave the country and receive a $2,500 payment, according to three sources familiar with the plans and an administration memo obtained by CNN.
    


            The Trump administration has already been offering financial incentives — including a $1,000 exit bonus — to undocumented adult immigrants in the US to depart the country. Administration officials have argued that self-deportation incentives are more cost effective, given the high price tag of immigrant detention and deportation.
    


            A notice sent to legal service providers Friday by the Department of Health and Human Services, seen by CNN, said the administration “will provide a one-time resettlement support stipend of $2,500 U.S. Dollars to unaccompanied alien children, 14 years of age and older, who have elected to voluntarily depart the United States as of the date of this notice and moving forward,” adding that the “benefit is intended to support reintegration efforts following departure.”
    


            The voluntary option is expected to first be offered to 17-year-old migrants and would need to be approved by an immigration judge. The payment would be given once the migrants arrive in their home country.
    


            CNN reached out to HHS, which is charged with caring for unaccompanied migrant children. HHS referred questions to the Department of Homeland Security.
    


            “ICE and the Office of Refugee and Resettlement at HHS are offering a strictly voluntary option to return home to their families. This voluntary option gives UACs a choice and allows them to make an informed decision about their future,” an Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesperson said in a statement to CNN, referring to unaccompanied migrant children.
    


            “Any payment to support a return home would be provided after an immigration judge grants the request and the individual arrives in their country of origin. Access to financial support when returning home would assist should they choose that option,” the spokesperson added.
    


            Trump administration officials have increasingly focused on migrant children who arrived in the US southern border alone and are awaiting to be placed with a sponsor, typically a parent or relative, in the United States. As of October 2, there were around 2,100 kids in HHS custody.
    


‘Are Mom and Dad not coming home?': American kids left stranded when ICE takes their parents



            The latest move appears to be an extension of ongoing efforts to repatriate migrant children in custody. In late August, the Trump administration prepared dozens of Guatemalan children to be sent back to their home country — a move that was temporarily blocked by a federal judge. Declarations from some parents of the children in Guatemala revealed that they were unaware their child was being deported and raised concern over their safety if returned. That case is ongoing.
    


            The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, which has been in place for more than two decades, provides protections for unaccompanied migrant children who arrive and reside in the US, including being screened to see if they are victims of human trafficking or have a credible fear of persecution in their home country.
    


            Generally, kids in custody are not affirmatively offered the option to leave voluntarily, and those who request it must have it approved by an immigration judge. ICE said kids, in this case, will also go before an immigration judge, who are there to ensure the child knows what it means, are making the choice of their own free will, and aren't being put in harm's way.
    


            “Voluntary departure has always been an option for unaccompanied children and when this option is explained by an attorney who has the child's best interest in mind, the risks and benefits can be fully explored. There is no legitimate reason for the government to affirmatively provide children with this option and incentivize it with a financial payoff,” said Neha Desai, managing director of Children's Human Rights & Dignity at the National Center for Youth Law, in a statement.
    


            Earlier this year, the administration separately moved to rapidly deport some migrant children who arrived in the US without a parent or guardian by having federal agents ask teens whether they want to voluntarily depart the country.
    


            The directive marked a departure from long-standing protocol which required that federal authorities turn over most unaccompanied children to HHS. Federal authorities previously didn't ask unaccompanied kids from countries other than Mexico and Canada if they wanted to self deport.
    


            The efforts to repatriate migrant children who are in immigration proceedings to determine whether they have protections in the US have sparked alarm among immigrant advocates and attorneys.
    


            While immigrant advocates maintain that child safety should be a priority, particularly when dealing with vulnerable migrant children, they argue that the Trump administration's policies risk doing more harm than good if they result in kids being sent back to dangerous conditions.
    


            The administration has also implemented additional vetting checks and other protocols prior to releasing a child from custody that have prolonged their stays in shelters.

President Donald Trump has asked members of his administration to investigate whether federal funds can be clawed back from Portland, Oregon, in the aftermath of violent antifa protests, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.

Conservative influencer Nick Sortor was arrested on charges of second-degree disorderly conduct as violent protests broke out near an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility, drawing outrage from Leavitt and an investigation from the Justice Department. 

“This incident is part of a troubling trend in Portland, where left-wing mobs believe they get to decide who can visit and live in their city. It is not their city, it is the American people's city, and President Trump is going to restore that,” Leavitt told reporters during a Friday afternoon press briefing. 

DOJ ORDERS INVESTIGATION INTO ‘WRONGFUL ARREST' OF CONSERVATIVE INFLUENCER NICK SORTOR IN PORTLAND

“I just spoke with the President about this, and he has directed his team here at the White House to begin reviewing aid that can potentially be cut in Portland. We will not fund states that allow anarchy,” she added. “There will also be an additional surge of federal resources to Portland immediately, including enhanced CBP and ICE resources. Law and order will prevail, and President Trump will make sure of it.”

The president has already moved to deploy 200 Oregon National Guard soldiers to Portland to crack down on recent protests, although a federal judge is reviewing the legality of the deployment. 

Portland Mayor Keith Wilson (D-OR) pushed back against attempts from the Trump administration to bring in federal forces after Friday's press briefing. 

“Let me be clear: Portland is not a military target. We will use every legal and constitutional tool at our disposal to protect our residents, uphold our values, and defend the rights of every Portlander,” Wilson said in a statement. 

Wilson's office also claimed that the threat to withhold funding was made without giving the office a formal notice or directive requiring a response and did not provide a clear mission, justification, or timeline.

“The federal government should be focused on partnering with us to expand housing, create jobs, and bolster social services – not siphon vital funding from our economy during a government shutdown that is already hurting cities like ours across the nation,” Wilson added. 

The crackdown on Portland comes amid the Trump administration's attempts to block funding to Democratic led cities and states amid the third day of a government shutdown. 

Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought placed $2.1 billion allocated to the Red Line Extension and the Red and Purple Modernization Project in Chicago “on hold.”

“It's because the administration is concerned that the Biden administration was handing out taxpayer dollars to pay for this construction based on DEI,” Leavitt explained to reporters. “DOT is reviewing the race-based contracting on unconstitutional grounds, and in the meantime, the Department of Transportation funds for these projects are on hold.” 

Vought also previously revealed on Wednesday that the government put $18 billion in funding on hold for several large-scale New York infrastructure projects due to similar concerns. He also paused or canceled another $8 billion for “Green New Scam” projects in 16 states, all led by Democrats.

Trump and Vought met on Thursday to discuss what agencies could potentially face more layoffs during the shutdown. Leavitt told reporters that “discussions continue between the Office of Management and Budget and Cabinet agencies across the board, and they are actively identifying where these cuts and these layoffs have to be made as this government shutdown hopefully does not continue.”

The Washington Examiner reached out to Portland for comment.

Several Democratic state attorneys general say the Trump administration has backed away from requiring states to agree to cooperate with the president's immigration agenda in order to access federal money for programs that help victims of crime.

In a series of news releases Friday, several of the attorneys general announced that federal Victims of Crime Act money was being released, enabling the states to fund victim assistance grants to nonprofits as well as their state compensation programs that provide direct aid to victims of violent crime. Officials from 20 states and Washington, D.C., had signed on to a lawsuit filed in late August challenging the requirement.

The federal conditions placed on the funds threatened to cut money to a state or subgrantee if it refused to honor civil immigration enforcement requests, denies U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers access to facilities or fails to provide advance notice of release dates of people possibly wanted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement because of their immigration status. 

New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin said in a statement that the U.S. Department of Justice, which overseas the crime victims funds, would remove the conditions that had been placed on applying for the money. Platkin's office declined to comment on the status of the lawsuit, though it still appeared active on the court website Friday.

An automatic reply sent in response to an email to a spokesperson for the Office of Justice Programs Friday noted the office would not respond because of the federal shutdown.

“Faced with our lawsuit, the Trump Administration has abandoned its cruel attempt to impose illegal conditions on nearly $1.4 billion in funding that supports victims and survivors of crime as they navigate their trauma and work to get back on their feet,” Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell wrote in an e-mailed statement. 




The lawsuit filed in late August had asked a federal judge to declare the conditions were an administrative overstep as well as unconstitutional. 

Every state and territory has a victims compensation program that follows federal guidelines, but largely is set up under state law to provide financial help to crime victims, including medical expense reimbursement, paying for crime scene cleanup, counseling or helping with funeral costs for homicide victims. The federal Victims of Crime Act covers the cost of about 75% of state compensation program awards.

The funds are also used to pay for other services, including testing rape kits, funding grants to domestic violence recovery organizations, trauma recovery centers and more.

Advocates and others argue that the system needs to protect victims regardless of their immigration status and ensure that reporting a crime does not lead to deportation threats. They also say that marginalized communities, such as newly arrived immigrants, are more likely to be crime targets. 

The same group of state attorneys general filed a similar joint lawsuit this week challenging a bar on using money for programs for crime victims and violence against women for services to people who are in the country illegally, contending the restrictions are unconstitutional, but also create an undue burden on service providers to determine the immigration status of victims and witnesses.

Tragedy struck Yosemite National Park Wednesday when popular Alaskan climber Balin Miller, 23, fell to his death from the iconic El Capitan — an accident reportedly captured during a livestream. 

"It is with a heavy heart I have to tell you my incredible son Balin Miller died during a climbing accident today," Miller's mother, Jeanine Girard-Moorman, said in a Facebook post. "My heart is (s)hattered in a million pieces."

Girard-Moorman told Fox News Digital on Friday that the young alpinist gained international attention from just doing what he loved, but "would be disappointed to be thought of as an influencer."

"He was talented beyond his years in the climbing world. He was an amazing athlete, smart, bold. He had a very unique and well loved sense of humor," Girard-Moorman said. "He loved to climb and people followed him on Instagram. It was never about the money for him. He just had a passion to climb. Live free."

Miller's older brother Dylan told The Associated Press that the climber was lead rope soloing — a way to climb alone while still protected by a rope — on a 2,400-foot route named Sea of Dreams. He apparently completed the climb but fell while hauling his gear and likely rappelled off the end of his rope, the AP reported.

Tributes have poured in for Miller from shocked viewers who said they also witnessed the tragic fall during a TikTok stream.

"He made it to the summit but he had to retrieve his bags as they got stuck on a rock as he was hoisting them up. As he was trying to retrieve the bags he fell to his death all caught on the livestream," Michelle Derrick posted on Facebook.

The tragedy unfolded on the first day of the federal government shutdown, which left national parks "generally" open with limited operations, according to the National Park Service. The park service said in a statement to the AP that "park rangers and emergency personnel responded immediately." The official cause of the fall is still under investigation.

El Capitan, one of Yosemite's most striking features, rises roughly 3,000 feet and is considered one of the most challenging walls in the world.

Miller had recently completed a solo ascent of Mount McKinley's Slovak Direct in Alaska, a technically difficult route that took him 56 hours to complete, he posted on his Instagram in June.

            Days after being fired, the top national security prosecutor in Virginia's eastern district taped a letter outside his former office accusing top Justice Department officials of being “more concerned” with going after President Donald Trump's perceived enemies than protecting the country's security.
    


            The typed letter dated Friday and signed by Michael Ben'Ary said that as a prosecutor, he took an oath “that requires you to follow the facts and the law wherever they lead, free from fear or favor, and unhindered by political interference.”
    


            “In recent months, the political leadership of the Department have violated these principles, jeopardizing our national security and making American citizens less safe,” he said.
    


            Ben'Ary's letter adds to a list of federal prosecutors who, since Trump took office in January, say they were fired as part of a political calculus and without consideration for their work.
    


The prosecutor was fired Wednesday after Julie Kelly, a pro-Donald Trump activist and writer, posted on X that “One can only assume he was a big part of the internal resistance to the (James) Comey indictment.”
    


            But he wasn't involved in the case against former FBI director James Comey case, CNN previously reported, and Ben'Ary denounced his firing as “without cause” and “based on little more than a single social media post containing false information.”
    


            Ben'Ary wrote that his firing “highlights the most troubling aspect of the current operations of the Department of Justice: the leadership is more concerned with punishing the President's perceived enemies than they are with protecting our national security.”
    


            Ben'Ary added that he was leading the criminal prosecution against a man allegedly involved in the planning of a bombing during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021.
    


            “Justice for Americans killed and injured by our enemies should not be contingent on what someone in the Department of Justice sees in their social media feed that day,” he said.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Justice Department for comment
    


            The Eastern District of Virginia was thrust into turmoil last month when its former leader was forced out over his refusal to indict one Trump's perceived enemies, New York Attorney General Letitia James, with mortgage fraud. The new US Attorney, Trump ally Lindsey Halligan, quickly secured an indictment against Comey for allegedly lying during congressional testimony about the Russia investigation.
    


            “The decisions to remove experienced career officials from US Attorneys Offices, the FBI, and other critical parts of DOJ undermines our country's ability to counter terrorist organizations, malign nation-state actors, and countless others that seek to harm our nation and its citizens,” Ben'Ary wrote.

            The Trump administration is reversing cuts to counterterrorism funding for New York after the president intervened, a person familiar with what happened told CNN.
    


            “I am pleased to advise that I reversed the cuts made to Homeland Security and Counterterrorism for New York City and State. It was my Honor to do so,” President Donald Trump said in a Truth Social post on Friday.
    


            Trump was only informed about the counterterrorism cuts to New York, which have been met with strong pushback from state leaders, in recent days and exploded in anger, ordering them to be reversed, the person said.
    


            “While FEMA's initial allocation fully met program requirements, after consultation with federal partners and in recognition of our critical security partnership with New York, FEMA is providing access to $136 million, bringing the State Homeland Security funding to $187 million to ensure it has the resources needed to counter and combat evolving threats,” a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said on Friday.
    


            New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul celebrated the news on X and credited Trump with the reversal, writing: “From the moment @Sec_Noem tried to defund our police and counterterrorism programs, we stood up and fought back. I'm glad that @POTUS heard our call to reverse these cuts.”
    


            “That means $187 million for the NYPD, FDNY & first responders across the state that keep New Yorkers safe,” she said.
    


            In a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem earlier this week, Hochul had warned that cutting 86% of homeland security funding from the state “serves only to make not just New York but all of America more vulnerable to terrorist attacks.”
    


            A district judge on Wednesday expressed similar concerns, citing 9/11 attacks and other threats, as they blocked the federal government from diverting or withdrawing $34 million in funding to protect New York's transportation system from terrorist attacks, the Associated Press reported.
    


            The striking reversal comes as the Trump administration has threatened New York and other blue states with consequences if the government shutdown persists, although cuts to counterterrorism funding predated the shutdown.
    


            Russell Vought, the White House's budget chief, said on Wednesday that the administration was pausing funding for two major New York City construction projects while the government is shut down.
    


            Vought added that construction on the Hudson Tunnel Project and the Second Avenue Subway are specifically being targeted.

President Donald Trump has set a firm deadline for the terrorist group Hamas to accept the peace deal he crafted with Israel and a coalition of Arab nations.

The president published a statement on Truth Social on Friday morning, putting a time limit on accepting the 20-point peace plan he calls Hamas's “last chance.”

“An Agreement must be reached with Hamas by Sunday Evening at SIX (6) P.M., Washington, D.C. time. Every Country has signed on! If this LAST CHANCE agreement is not reached, all HELL, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas.”

He added, “THERE WILL BE PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.”

The announcement gives Hamas a few extra days to deliberate its next move, as Trump estimated earlier this week that the terrorist group had “three or four” days to decide — a time frame that has already elapsed.

Reports in Saudi outlets suggest that Hamas leadership is torn over the deal, with officials prepared to “not reject the plan entirely” but instead “accept it in part, with the addition of amendments related to certain issues, particularly those related to the handover of the hostages, the withdrawal of the IDF, and other matters.”

Such a lukewarm response will be a tough sell for the Trump administration, which has expressed a “take it or leave it” attitude regarding this final offer.

Failing to accept the plan could also lose Hamas its last remaining allies, neighboring Arab nations that have grown tired of the terrorist group's unwillingness to establish peace.

Trump specifically shouted out the “great, powerful, and very rich Nations of the Middle East, and the surrounding areas beyond” that worked with the United States to craft his plan.

Egypt and Qatar, which have been key mediators with Hamas for years, are pressuring the terrorist group to take this opportunity and end the conflict.

Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al Thani reportedly told Hamas leaders during a meeting in Doha on Monday that he would be unable to secure a better deal for them than the current offer.

The plan outlines a multistep restructuring of Gaza, including the total disarmament of Hamas, free flow of humanitarian aid to civilians, and the establishment of a transitional government.

“Most of the [remaining Hamas soldiers] are surrounded and MILITARILY TRAPPED, just waiting for me to give the word, ‘GO,' for their lives to be quickly extinguished,” Trump said in his Friday statement. “As for the rest, we know where and who you are, and you will be hunted down, and killed.”

“I am asking that all innocent Palestinians immediately leave this area of potentially great future death for safer parts of Gaza. Everyone will be well cared for by those that are waiting to help. Fortunately for Hamas, however, they will be given one last chance!” the president added. “THIS DEAL ALSO SPARES THE LIVES OF ALL REMAINING HAMAS FIGHTERS!”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly opposed the plan at first but was strong-armed into support by Trump following the Jewish state's unprecedented cross-border bombings into Qatar last month. Now, the prime minister says there is no other way forward.

“This can be done the easy way, or it can be done the hard way, but it will be done,” Netanyahu said while giving a conference with Trump at the White House on Monday. “We prefer the easy way, but it has to be done.”

The U.S. offered Qatar a defense guarantee against future aggression following Israel's strikes.

            At least 18 people were arrested outside the Broadview Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility near Chicago Friday, where protesters have gathered several weeks in a row amid bubbling tensions as the Trump administration's larger immigration enforcement efforts continue.
    


            Protesters filled the streets outside the facility Friday as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was perched on the rooftop of the controversial building, surrounded by armed agents and a camera crew, according to CNN affiliate WLS. Friday's protests mirror demonstrations seen at the ICE facility in recent weeks.
    


            Broadview police officers and Cook County sheriff's deputies held the line near a large group of protesters and were instructed at one point to put on gas masks. The crowd briefly diminished during the afternoon hours but regained size in the evening as a crowd took hold of the corner across from the facility.
    


            At least five people have been arrested for aggravated battery to a police officer and resisting and obstruction, the Cook County Sheriff's Office told CNN. DHS reported 13 additional arrests Friday evening.
    


            Following the protests at the Broadview ICE facility and the arrest of conservative influencer Nick Sortor near an ICE facility in Portland, Oregon, Noem has requested assistance from the Pentagon, she said while speaking with right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson.



            “We're not just going to be rolling out of Chicago here, but we're sending in the Department of War at the request that I made to Secretary Hegseth. They're going to be rolling in here within the next 24 hours. They'll be coming to Chicago too, I put in a request in today for them to come to Chicago,” Noem told Johnson. “What we saw happen to that journalist will not happen again,” she said in reference to Portland.
    


            There are no written orders for the National Guard to be deployed to Chicago, and there is no unit preparing for that mission, a US Northern Command spokesperson told CNN.
    


            Later in the day, Noem said that she and her team were blocked from entering the Village of Broadview Municipal Building, calling the incident “absolutely shameful” in a post on X.
    


            “We were stopping for a quick bathroom break. This is a public building,” Noem said in the post. The building is less than a mile from the local ICE facility.
    


            “This is how JB Pritzker and his cronies treat our law enforcement,” she said in the post.
    


            Village of Broadview spokesperson David Ormsby told CNN in a statement, “We are distressed to hear that the bathrooms are unavailable at the ICE facility.”
    


            Noem visited Broadview's Village Hall unannounced to ask for a meeting with Mayor Katrina Thompson, who was out at the time, the spokesperson said.
    


            “The mayor returned her visit,” Ormsby said. “Mayor Thompson went to the ICE center, accompanied by the Broadview Police Chief Thomas, and officers, to ask for the illegal fence to be dismantled. The mayor was told by agents at the gate the secretary was unavailable to meet.”
    


            The facility, about 10 miles west of Chicago, has been the site of demonstrations against ramped-up ICE enforcement and aggressive tactics for several weeks. Similar protests have flared across the country, including this week in Portland, Oregon, as the White House has aimed to crack down on crime more broadly in Democratic-led cities, often citing the need to protect ICE sites.
    


            Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker warned of a constitutional crisis during a speech Friday, saying the Trump administration wants people “to get used to the idea of the military roaming our streets.”
    


            “Our house is on fire, and our firefighters are using their hoses to water the lawn outside,” Pritzker said while speaking at a fundraiser held by Georgia Democrats. “My message of alarm is that the constitutional crisis is not on its way; it is here, and we all better start acting like it.”
    


            The protests near Chicago began after local leaders got word in early September that “a large-scale enforcement campaign” would soon be underway in the Windy City as part of the Trump administration's sweeping immigration agenda.
    


            The Midway Blitz Operation has resulted in more than 1,000 arrests, the Department of Homeland Security said in a news release Friday.
    


            “Federal agents reporting to Secretary Noem have spent weeks snatching up families, scaring law-abiding residents, violating due process rights, and even detaining U.S. citizens,” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker wrote on Facebook on Friday.
    


            Federal agents are also “acting with impunity,” the governor said in a statement provided to CNN.
    


            “In addition to their inhumane tactics on immigration enforcement, they have grossly mishandled and incited tensions at the Broadview facility. This includes firing chemical agents at protesters and media, arresting a reporter, slamming people to the ground, and wreaking havoc on Broadview residents and nearby businesses,” the statement said in part.
    


            The governor criticized Noem's visit to the state in the Facebook post, saying she “should no longer be able to step foot inside the State of Illinois without any form of public accountability.”
    


            “It's been nearly 45 days since Secretary Noem has held an official press conference, so it's time she faces the public and takes questions from the press to be held accountable for the Trump Administration's gross misconduct,” Pritzker said in the Facebook post.
    


            Local, state and federal agencies have a large presence at the facility, and have closed multiple streets, including 25th Avenue, a major street in Broadview.

            Protesters outside the facility Friday morning held signs and chanted. One sign read, “ICE melts under resistance,” meanwhile another said, “Hate has no home here.”
    


            Protester Nicole Bandyk lives in a nearby suburb and decided to join the demonstrators after watching coverage of the protests in news reports and online.
    


            “I'm not gonna look back and say I sat at home and did nothing,” Bandyk told CNN. “It's wrong … It's just wrong what they're doing. We are becoming a fascist authoritarian state and it's wrong.”
    


            El Centro Border Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino accompanied Noem on the roof, according to WLS, and was later seen on the ground directing protesters and media away from the area.
    


            The latest round of arrests come two weeks after a Democratic Chicago-area mayor running for Congress in Illinois said federal agents teargassed him outside the same facility.
    


            Daniel Biss, the mayor of Evanston, Illinois, spoke about the incident in a video on his X account, saying: “Not only did they come with weapons and violence, show of force and drive a van into us, but then they teargassed us, and I have to tell you, it was terrifying.”

            At least one other person, who identified herself on social media as Kat Abughazaleh, a former journalist also running for Congress, landed on the ground during that same protest after she was pushed by a federal law enforcement agent in a camouflage uniform wearing a full face covering, sunglasses and a helmet, video by CNN affiliate WBBM showed.
    


            “We stood in front of the van and they (an officer) came out and picked me up and threw me on the ground,” Abughazaleh told CNN at the time, adding that federal agents fired pepper balls at her and weaponless protesters carrying signs.

Taylor Swift used to try to hide her ambition. In Life of a Showgirl, she's done with that.

At the end of Taylor Swift's newly released 12th album, The Life of a Showgirl, the narrator makes a somewhat shocking confession.

In the album's final song, the title track, the narrator describes the sordid life of a showgirl: the betrayals, the faithless men, the industry indifference. She urges the song's second narrator — a wide-eyed dreamer “as sweet as a peach,” also voiced by Swift — not to strive after the spotlight.

The peach-sweet dreamer decides she's going to aim for fame nonetheless. She takes the first showgirl's warning to heart, finding that by the peak of her career, all the up and comers are “bitches” who wish she would “hurry up and die.” Regardless, the dreamer-turned-icon has no plans to do so: “I'm immortal, baby dolls,” she croons. “I couldn't if I tried.” For that reason, she's “married to the hustle,” and despite the “pain hidden by lipstick and lace,” she “wouldn't have it any other way.”

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

As the song fades out, we hear what appears to be audio from the end of a performance of Swift's record-breaking Eras Tour, as she thanks the audience and the band and Sabrina Carpenter for opening for her. (Carpenter sings a verse on “Showgirl.”) The association is complete: Swift is both the peach-sweet striver and the cynical industry vet, and regardless of what pain her experience may have caused her, she is glad she made it to the top.

It's the “wouldn't have it any other way” line that startled me.

Pop stars tend to sing a lot about the tragedy and pain of fame, and Swift is no exception. Her last album, 2024's The Tortured Poet's Department, included a callout of her own Swifties as “wine moms” and “judgmental creeps” for criticizing her relationship with Matty Healy. So it's not unusual for Swift to sing about the dark side of fame. But it is unusual, both for pop stars in general and Swift in particular, to finish up such a song by announcing that nonetheless, she wants to be famous and she is happy that she is.

The idea that Swift has pursued fame with a single-minded fixation since the beginning of her career cannot be news to anyone who has ever given one of her songs a more than cursory listen. From her self-titled release in 2006 forward, Swift's public persona has seemed to vibrate from a desire to win: Grammys, billboard battles, feuds, prestige, money, history, everything.

That pure intensity of ambition has always been one of the most compelling aspects of Swift's star image, all the more so because it is so in tension with her sweet everygirl relatability. In a culture that discourages feminine agency, nice girls are not supposed to be ambitious, and Taylor Swift is nothing if not a nice girl. Yet all the same, Swift wants with such an unfeminine lack of restraint (complimentary).

At times, Swift's ambition has read as a liability. At the parts of her career when she's leaned hardest into her niceness, circa 2014 or so, she seemed to be uncomfortable showing her ambition directly. When it appeared anyway, it made her audience uncomfortable, too: it meant they felt that she was lying to them.

Every time she won another award — and she was winning a lot — she made a surprised face that people said looked fake. When she got photographed by the paparazzi — and she was papped a lot — people said the pictures looked posed. When Kim Kardashian leaked snippets of a conversation between Swift and Kanye West that made it appear Swift was lying to the public in a cynical ploy for sympathy, people said she was a conniving snake. (Swift would later be vindicated when the full tape leaked.)

After all, which one was Swift: the cold-eyed striver or the peach-sweet dreamer? She couldn't be both, could she? No woman could, surely. The harder she insisted on being a dreamer, the more it felt like a lie, because anyone could see how hard she was working and how much she wanted to be huge.

How disorienting if she was both, after all. Yet how thrilling, too.

Since her 2017 Reputation era, Swift has learned how to integrate aspects of her obsessive perfectionism into her good girl image without diluting either. We live in a moment that rewards celebrities who show their work over celebrities who make it look easy (see Beyoncé), and Swift didn't shy away from showing the sheer physical strain of performing her three-hour Eras tour set night after night after night.

She's also played with making her ambition less threatening by putting it in a romantic context. In “Mastermind” from 2022's Midnights, she sings about a woman who ruthlessly strategizes her romantic conquests, only to be rewarded with a boyfriend who knows she's plotting her way to him and likes that about her. “I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian 'cause I care,” she sighs, a little joking, a little mournful.

Swift has released songs about how afraid she is that her fame will crest and fall away from her. “I'm not trying to exaggerate, but I think I might die if it happened, die if it happened to me,” she sings in character as a young striver in “Clara Bow” from 2024's Tortured Poet Department. The song ends with Swift herself rendered as obsolete as original It Girl Clara Bow, left only as a reference for some new up-and-comer who looks “like Taylor Swift” but has “edge she never did.”

Yet in “Life of a Showgirl,” Swift is in no danger of losing her spotlight. Sure, fame is rough and people say mean things about her sometimes, but still — “I wouldn't have it any other way.”

It's a remarkably self-assured statement from someone who has spent so much of her career furiously working to portray a non-threatening girl next door. It suggests a Taylor Swift who is done apologizing for being ambitious, who sees no profit in trying to cover it up any longer. She is, like the narrator of “Mastermind,” telling us that none of this was accidental, that nothing was gonna stop her, and that furthermore she isn't tortured by her fame; she's happy about it.

At the same time, she isn't dropping the insistence on her approachable niceness. She is “not a bad bitch,” as she sings on “Eldest Daughter.” She's a responsible oldest child, clearly announcing her intentions to marry her boyfriend and have a bunch of kids. She just also loves being famous and has no intention of giving it up.

All of us, like the boyfriend in “Mastermind,” knew the entire time that this was the case, if we are being honest. No one gets to Swift's level without working hard and without liking it at least a little bit. What's new here is seeing her acknowledge it without any apology, and being forced to confront our own knowledge of Swift's ambition at the same time.

We're living in a moment of deep anti-feminist backlash, one where it's becoming an increasingly common talking point from conservatives to say that a woman's highest purpose is to have children. The policies of Trump's administration have been both effectively and ineffectively targeted at pushing women out of the workforce. Charlie Kirk spent the week before he died telling a newly engaged Swift that she should submit to her husband, take his last name, and have a passel of babies.

“Maybe one of the reasons why Taylor Swift has been so annoyingly liberal over the last couple of years is that she's not yet married and she doesn't have children,” Kirk mused. “That's not a great role model for young women, to wait all the way until you're 35 and just put your career first.” Nice girls, after all, are not ambitious: They put family before work.

Yet here is Swift, just weeks after announcing her engagement, singing about being happy that she knows the life of a showgirl. Right now, despite everything else, the biggest star in the world is a woman who is willing to crow over her own professional and artistic ambition.

            Hamas announced that it had agreed to “immediately” enter negotiations for the release of all hostages according to President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan — a potential breakthrough after months of failed efforts to end the war.
    


            Hamas stopped short of accepting the Trump proposal unconditionally. The militant group said it is ready to immediately enter negotiations through mediators to discuss the details of the exchange and said it is ready to hand over the governance of Gaza to “a Palestinian authority of independents (technocrats) based on Palestinian national consensus and with reliance on Arab and Islamic support.”
    


            The response to the Trump proposal, which was sent to the US through mediators, was obtained by CNN.
    


            Trump — who earlier Friday had issued an ultimatum for Hamas to respond by Sunday evening — responded positively to the announcement, writing on Truth Social that he believes Hamas is “ready for a lasting PEACE.” And he called on Israel to halt its bombardment of Gaza in order to extract hostages.
    


            “Israel must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the Hostages out safely and quickly! Right now, it's far too dangerous to do that. We are already in discussions on details to be worked out,” Trump added.
    


            In a subsequent video posted to Truth Social, the president called it a “big day,” while cautioning: “We'll see how it all turns out. We have to get the final word down in concrete.”
    


            The release of the remaining 48 hostages within 72 hours and the agreement to relinquish power in Gaza were two of the key demands of the Trump proposal but were viewed as potential red lines that would lead to Hamas' rejection of the plan.
    


            The stated agreement of Hamas to these two conditions provides a pathway forward for a ceasefire proposal that has international backing, especially amid growing calls for an end to the war. But a finalized ceasefire deal is far from certain, even with Qatar, Egypt and Turkey pressuring Hamas to accept the proposal.
    


            The Hamas response makes no mention of disarmament or the decommissioning of weaponry, another critical part of the Trump proposal that Hamas has repeatedly rejected. Nor does the Hamas response address the creation of an international oversight committee led by Trump — which he's dubbed the “Board of Peace” — to supervise the governance of Gaza.
    


            Instead, Hamas broadly said the remaining issues mentioned in the American proposal “related to the future of the Gaza Strip and the inherent rights of the Palestinian people” will be discussed in the future. Hamas also insisted that it “will be included and will contribute with full responsibility” to a “comprehensive national Palestinian framework.” That statement defies the Trump proposal's demand that Hamas and other militant factions in Gaza play no role in governing the battered territory “directly or indirectly.”
    


            Trump had been waiting since Monday to hear a response to the 20-point plan he unveiled at the White House alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said at their joint appearance that he agreed to the framework.
    


            Earlier Friday, Trump had said if the terror group hasn't agreed to the proposal by 6 p.m. ET on Sunday, “all HELL, like no one has ever seen before, will break out.”
    


            It's unlikely mediators can reach an agreement between Israel and Hamas on such a tight timeline, but they can potentially begin the negotiations needed to bridge the key gaps in the proposal.
    


            Egypt, one of the mediators in negotiations surrounding Israel's war in Gaza, called Hamas' response a “positive development.”
    


            “Egypt hopes that this positive development will elevate all parties to the level of responsibility by committing to implementing President Trump's plan on the ground and ending the war,” a foreign ministry statement read.
    


            Fellow mediator Qatar also welcomed the Hamas announcement, adding in its statement that it has started working with Egypt and the US “to complete discussions regarding the plan to ensure the end of the war.”
    


            After Hamas' response, Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid said there is an “unprecedented opportunity” to free the remaining hostages and end the war.
    


            In a statement on X, he called on the Israeli government to announce that it will join talks to finalize the 20-point proposal and said he had informed the Trump administration that Netanyahu has the political backing to reach a deal.
    


            Lapid has repeatedly stated his willingness to provide Netanyahu with a political safety net in order to support a hostage deal, but he has avoided detailing specifics of what such an agreement with Netanyahu would actually look like.
    


            Under Trump's proposal, all of Hamas' infrastructure above and below ground would be destroyed, with the supervision of independent monitors, “and not rebuilt.”
    


            The plan calls for Israel to release 250 Palestinian prisoners with life sentences, as well as 1,700 Palestinians detained since the start of the war, in exchange for Hamas freeing 48 hostages, 20 of whom are believed to be alive. Hamas members can be granted amnesty after that if they “commit to peaceful co-existence and to decommission their weapons.”
    


            Israel would gradually withdraw from Gaza as a temporary International Stabilization Force (ISF), led by Arab partners, takes over security in the battered territory, according to the plan. Meanwhile, a Palestinian committee, overseen by an international body dubbed the “Board of Peace,” would run Gaza until a reformed Palestinian Authority is ready to take over. The proposal recognizes the aspiration for a Palestinian state and tries to present a “credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.”
    


            Trump said a day after the announcement he would give Hamas three or four days to respond. Hamas has been in discussions with regional mediators from Qatar and Egypt to discuss the plan. Trump spoke midweek with Qatar's emir for an update on the conversations.
    


            Communication problems with Hamas' military leaders in Gaza could have been complicating receiving an official response, according to US officials who were advised of the difficulties by regional partners earlier this week.
    


            The sporadic contacts, paired with divisions among Hamas leadership over elements of the plan, may have been prolonging the group's response, the officials said before Hamas responded.
    


            In previous attempts at securing a ceasefire, communications were halting between Hamas' political wing, based in Qatar, and its military leaders in Gaza.

            A statue of President Donald Trump and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein holding hands has returned to the National Mall after it was removed by the National Park Service last week.
    


            Called “Best Friends Forever,” the statue shows Trump and Epstein each with a foot kicked back and a hand flailing into the air, as well as a plaque between the pair titled “In Honor of Friendship Month” that reads: “We celebrate the long-lasting bond between President Donald J. Trump and his ‘closest friend,' Jeffrey Epstein.”
    


            Trump has denied having had a close relationship with Epstein, and has dismissed the controversies surrounding their ties as a “Democratic hoax.”
    


            The statue was put back together by the organization responsible for it, “The Secret Handshake.” It had been dismantled and severely damaged after its ordered removal last week, and there are still visible marks of the damage.
    


            CNN has reached out to NPS on the statue's return.
    


            A spokesperson for the Department of the Interior, which oversees NPS, told CNN last week that the statue was removed “because it was not compliant with the permit issued.”
    


            The permit for the statue's return was approved on September 30, before the federal government shutdown. A member of “The Secret Handshake” told CNN the group was told that the shutdown should not affect the statue's installation.
    


            “The Secret Handshake” has previously installed other sculptures on the National Mall which went viral. In 2024, the group put up “The Resolute Desk,” a bronze replica of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's desk – topped with an emoji-like poop the size of a basketball – meant to allude to the January 6 insurrection, when a Donald Trump supporter who stormed the Capitol was infamously photographed with his feet on the desk.
    


            The group also installed a statue in Freedom Plaza titled, “The Donald J. Trump Enduring Flame,” a bronze statue of a tiki torch, which appeared to mock Trump's defense of the marchers who attended a White supremacist rally in 2017. And it put up the “Dictator Approved” statue, which depicted a golden hand giving a thumbs up and crushing the Statue of Liberty's crown, on the National Mall.

The amphibian “IVF clinic” fighting to save the first amphibian ever afforded federal protections.

Love — or at least sex — was in the air of the small, windowless, biosecure room at the Fort Worth Zoo in Texas. Sixteen rectangular, clear plastic bins lined the room's back and side walls, tiny stages for unlikely romances.

Each bin contained a plastic green pond plant — the kind you would buy for fish to make Nemo feel at home — about an inch of water, and two endangered Houston toads, a drab-looking critter with a pale belly, dark spots, and raised patches of skin that, in a betrayal of the stereotypes, aren't warts.

It was a Wednesday afternoon over the spring, and Allison Julien, the zoo's reproductive science biologist, prepped 16 syringes to inject hormones into the croaking male toads to help, well, get them in the mood. The females, hanging out in their respective bins, had already been injected with their doses since it takes them longer to both lay eggs and acquiesce to the next step.

Soon, each female shuffled around her tub, laying a string of thousands of tiny eggs strung together like black pearls. A male clung to her back, his legs wrapped around her body and his little toes mashed to her belly as — and sorry to get graphic here — he peed on her eggs; for this species, sperm is released in their urine. The fake vegetation helped the egg strands spread out to maximize fertilization. And I like to think…might have even helped a little with the ambiance.

You probably haven't thought much about amphibian-assisted reproduction lately (or, let's be honest, ever). But in a lab tucked inside the Fort Worth Zoo, scientists are playing matchmaker for one of the rarest toads in the country — performing ultrasounds, injecting hormones, counting eggs by the tens of thousands, and trying to keep a species alive with spreadsheets and syringes.

The Houston toad, once common across southeast Texas, is now so endangered that its best shot at survival involves assisted reproduction, willing landowners, and some very determined humans who want to help them survive again in the wild.

It's weird, hopeful, kind of beautiful — and it just might be working.



The Houston toad was first identified in the 1940s near an old airfield base in southeast Houston, where crashed planes from World War I military exercises littered the ground.

After that initial discovery, herpetologists made sporadic observations of hundreds of toads at individual ponds, on coastal plains, and in forests across 13 Texas counties, but their sightings were still relatively few and far between.

“The challenge is [the Houston toad has] always been kind of rare,” said Paul Crump, the state herpetologist for Texas Parks and Wildlife, who has worked for nearly two decades on Houston toad recovery. “And we've only got these little glimpses into what it's doing.”

All the while, Houston toad numbers were declining, and declining fast.

By the mid-century, people in the state had introduced non-native species like fire ants that bit and killed juvenile toads, feral hogs that ate them and reduced wetland water quality, and grasses that made it difficult for toads to navigate. Meanwhile, Texas was expanding fast into Houston toad habitat — turning forests and savannahs into farmland, houses and suburban subdivisions, shopping centers and parking lots.

The toad needed help, and so in 1969, it was included in the Endangered Species Conservation Act, the precursor to the 1973 Endangered Species Act, making the Houston toad one of the first federally protected amphibians in the country.

But the listing may have been too late. In the years since, the Houston toad has likely declined more than 90 percent.

The Houston toad isn't among the class of iconic megafauna like grizzly bears or wolves. It doesn't grace national emblems like the golden eagle or put food on our tables like Canada geese. But uncharismatic species like the Houston toad still matter.

“They're like rivets on an airplane,” said Crump. “All these pieces exist in a system, and there's probably some redundancy, but you can only lose so many amphibian species, just like you can only lose so many rivets on an airplane, before things fall apart.”

And the planet is losing a lot of rivets.

Amphibians are among the most endangered classes of animals on Earth. More than 40 percent are threatened with extinction, and as many as 220 have already blinked out. That means fewer creatures to eat disease-carrying mosquitoes, and fewer animals to feed other animals. So many amphibians died in recent decades in Costa Rica and Panama, for example, that malaria cases in humans in the mid-2000s spiked.

Protecting a species like the Houston toad also means restoring and maintaining habitat. That helps not only countless other native species like quail and deer but also protects aquifers that supply our drinking water.

And while efforts like assisted reproduction may sound herculean (they often are), Diane Barber, the Fort Worth Zoo's senior curator of ectotherms (animals that rely on external sources for temperature regulation), said they're relatively inexpensive in the world of keeping species alive.

If 130,000 sounds like a lot of embryos for a single day's work, it is.

At the Fort Worth Zoo, technicians individually counted and marked the latest batch of fertilized Houston toad eggs, adding them to the 3 million embryos they and three other breeding facilities planned to catalog. Eventually, they hope to introduce them into the few ponds where researchers know small numbers of Houston toads still exist in the wild.

If it works, that's a lot of baby toads that can eventually find their own mates.

The species may be critically endangered, but following Marvin Gaye's advice was never their issue. They're good at reproducing, said Barber, if they can just live long enough to find each other — a sometimes impossible hurdle for a critically endangered species.

So in 2007, researchers scooped up portions of three Houston toad egg strands and brought them into captivity, and began the years-long process of figuring out how to breed and raise endangered toads.

A few years later, Barber brought toadlets to the Fort Worth Zoo and turned breeding from a series of tossing toads together, crossing fingers, and hoping for the best, to an exercise in spreadsheets, hormone injections, and tediously kept calendars.

Barber keeps records of the genetic lineage of every toad bred in each of the four project facilities. Each Wednesday after breeding, she sits in her office surrounded by drawings and sketches of Houston toads and Puerto Rican crested toads (another amphibian on the brink) and parses the complex data on her monitors, deciding which individuals are best suited for the next week's matchmaking session.

She has to interpret the results of ultrasounds performed on females to see if they are ready to release eggs. Then she uses a convoluted algorithm to pair together female and male toads best suited by size (if the male is too small, he can't hold onto the female, and if he's too big, he might drown her), and, most importantly, by their distance from one another on the Houston toad family tree. She is not selecting for individual traits so much as preventing toad incest.

“We don't want to breed nieces, nephews, cousins, siblings, brothers, or sisters,” she said. Maintaining genetic diversity in endangered species work can be a major challenge — especially when populations originate from a small number of wild individuals, and every toad is inevitably a little bit related.

If a male contains important genetics — as in, is not closely related to many of the females — but is too small to mate with them, Julien collects his microscopic sperm and either freezes it in a cryopreservation bank or artificially fertilizes a good match's eggs.

“If the Houston Zoo, for example, has had an important male die, they will ship us the male's testes and [Julien] will mash them up and preserve the sperm,” said Barber.

Once this intricate process is complete, Barber and her team load the eggs into plastic bags and place them in buckets along with dozens of juvenile toads not needed for breeding for a long drive south to one of the only places in the wild where Houston toads can currently survive.

Today, more than 10 million people live across San Antonio, the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area, and Houston. But just past the billboards, six-lane highways, and sprawling development, biologists believe there's an existing ecosystem where the Houston toad could soon thrive again.

And that's because the state of Texas has an intricate plan that is finally beginning to lock into place.

This spring, Barber, with her buckets filled with toad eggs in tow, pulled up to the gated entrance of a large property owned by Scouting America Capitol Area Council, an arm of what was formerly known as the Boy Scouts of America. It's a sprawling piece of undeveloped Texas, with stretches of oak and loblolly pine forests and peppered with scenic ponds — perfect for ropes courses, hiking, and lessons on living in the wild.

Mike Forstner, a Texas State University biologist who has studied the Houston toad for decades, Jon Yates, the CEO of the Capitol Area Council, and a handful of other biologists from TSU and the Fish and Wildlife Service waited for Barber and her precious cargo. Those strings of tiny pearls suspended in plastic bags would soon join any wild egg masses in one of two small ponds on the Scouts' property, the Griffith League Scout Ranch.

The pond is the Houston toad's nursery, where, if the eggs are lucky, they'll hatch into tadpoles, swim out of the mesh baskets where they've been placed, and enter the pond's ecosystem. Eventually, with even more luck, they'll emerge as toadlets where they'll wander into the surrounding woods to eat — and eventually return to the pond to find mates.

That this property and the surrounding areas are the only known ecosystem supporting wild Houston toads is ironic — it very nearly was the final nail in its coffin.

When the Scouts inherited the property from the matriarch of an old Texas family in 1997, they had big plans to clear the pines, oaks, and ponds to build a massive Scouts' events camp. But then the Scouts discovered Houston toads on the property. And so they decided they could make a more nature-based adventure park for their Scouts while also conserving an endangered species.

“There was a lot of consternation (at first),” said Yates about the decision to keep the land intact for conservation. But eventually the Scouts found a good balance: They cut hiking trails, curated education opportunities, and even built a ropes course. Essentially, Scouting America could “still have Scouts on it but do the right thing for conservation,” Yates said.

But even here — in this figurative walled garden as well as a nearby state park — the last remaining wild Houston toads have struggled. Persistent drought in the area has dried many of the ephemeral ponds where Houston toads live, and then a wildfire incinerated much of the remaining occupied Houston toad habitat, including almost an entire neighboring state park.

By 2016, Houston toads were closer to extinction than they'd ever been. “Houston toads went down to a dozen individuals,” said Forstner as he placed pond water in the bags with strings of eggs to acclimate the embryos to the wild. But now, thanks to the Scouts' effort and assisted reproduction, the population is estimated to be somewhere shy of 800.

The Scouts' ranch is a good start, but restoring Houston toads in the wild requires more than one population on one piece of land.

And so Crump and Zach Truelock, a private lands biologist with the Amphibian and Reptile Conservancy, along with officials from the USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service and US Fish and Wildlife Service, have made it their mission to find toads more homes, largely through an incentive-based state property tax program and a cost-share program for habitat work that helps landowners create places for the Houston toad to live. If landowners agree to manage their property to the benefit of Houston toads and countless other species, the state of Texas will give them a better deal on their property taxes.

Once the program identifies friendly property owners willing to give the Houston toad a leg up, the focus turns to battling a native plant species called yaupon. A prolific grower, yaupon was once kept in check by regular wildfires but now, in the absence of healthy fires, it grows in impenetrable patches like willows on steroids.

So Crump connects landowners with grants that helps landowners pay for either burning or mechanically cutting down the yaupon.

José Bermúdez, a philosophy professor at Texas A&M University, is one of those landowners. Decades before he bought his property northwest of Houston a handful of years ago, the land had been used as a ranch. But when the former owner stopped grazing cattle, yaupon took over. Yaupon branches wove too tightly together for deer and humans and shaded the ground, preventing light and nutrients from growing anything underneath.

With a grant from the Fish and Wildlife Service, Bermúdez mechanically cut down 50 acres of yaupon and created large swaths of open space. His wife takes bird walks through his property and every week records more species, already noticing a difference in habitat. He's a long way from welcoming Houston toads to his property — he just started his restoration work — but that's the ultimate goal.

“The Houston toad is like a lot of these iconic species,” he said. “It's a way of preserving the land for other things.”

Dozens of landowners like Bermúdez participate in the program. But even with federal grants, cutting, burning, and clearing yaupon takes time and money. Why do it? In part because long-term, managing and conserving the habitat may actually save him money.

Thirty years ago, Texas voters made a consequential decision. The state already evaluated the value of agricultural land differently than a house in a city, understanding that 40,000-, 70,000- or 100,000-acre ranches used for grazing cattle weren't worth the same as even a city block in, say, downtown Austin. The effect was, essentially, a tax break for anyone raising livestock.

But then deer hunters, environmentalists, and landowners had an idea: What if those same benefits could go to people who produced not cows and sheep, but native wildlife like deer, quail, or songbirds?

Texas voters agreed. Now landowners get the same change in valuation by participating in some meaningful conservation practices like setting out bird boxes or feeders, shooting feral hogs, poisoning fire ant mounds, or cutting and burning overgrowth.

Depending on the property size, it could be a difference of tens of thousands of dollars each year. And ultimately, it means someone like Bermúdez is a lot more likely to help out a beleaguered little species like the Houston toad. This kind of capitalistic mutual benefit may just be one of the best approaches to solving our country's endangered species conundrums, and in a state like Texas, where more than 93 percent of the land is private, a lot is possible — at least when reasonable landowners are part of the equation.

Not far from the Scouts' property, land owners Roxanne and Elvis Hernandez aren't in it for tax benefits — they're in it for the toads.

A framed painting of the Houston toad even hangs prominently on the wall of their living room, and they yearn for nothing more than the trill of the Houston toad from one of the ponds on their property, which they finally heard for the first time in early May.

But even with their altruistic motivation, keeping up the work is about to get a lot harder.

Cuts to the federal government and conservation programs through agencies like the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) mean that important grants that helped support the work that families like the Hernandezes do may never arrive.

“Habitat work is not inexpensive,” Roxanne Hernandez said. “And any cutback in funding is just a setback for the conservation effort.”

And so I wanted to witness the work still underway. On a muggy spring night after we transplanted all those eggs, I went out with Crump to survey wooded areas where Houston toads once called but hadn't been heard from in well over a decade. Was it possible they still existed somewhere else in the wild? After all these efforts, had they spread? Had they reproduced somewhere else, tucked away, hidden from all those threats?

We'd been creeping along rural county dirt roads in an old Chevy Silverado. We stopped every so often to hop out and listen again. We heard a lot that night — the cricket frog's chatter, the Gulf Coast toad's raspy trill, and the green tree frog's nasal “quank.” But not a hint of the Houston toad. At nearly 2 am, Crump sighed. But despite our abysmal night, he wasn't ready to call it.

“It's either optimism or quitting,” he said about Houston toad recovery efforts. “And I'm not ready to quit yet.”

We drove back to the outskirts of the Scout property. It was 2:30 in the morning when we pulled over on the side of a paved road near rural homes. Crump and Truelock might have felt optimistic, but I sure didn't. We rolled the windows down and waited, listening as 24-hour highway traffic hummed in the distance.

And then, in the stillness of a Texas night, came the sound: a lone, high-pitched trill, ringing out like a tiny bell. One male Houston toad, calling into the dark, maybe born in a Tupperware of fertilized eggs, maybe wild, maybe the offspring of both — but alive. It wasn't much. Just one voice. But after everything — the hormones, the spreadsheets, the chainsaws, the habitat deals — it was enough to remind everyone why they keep doing this.

Because if a toad that's almost gone can still call for a future, the least we can do is try to answer.

Richard Cox is a 58-year-old repeat Tier III sex offender who spent the second half of 2024 prowling female locker rooms in northern Virginia, where he would ogle schoolgirls and expose himself to bystanders.

Fairfax County, where Cox exposed himself repeatedly last year, never prosecuted him because, as the police chief put it, “The policy of Parks & Rec allowed him and other persons to use the locker room of the gender that they identify with.”

In both Fairfax and neighboring Arlington County, county officials allowed Cox to undress in women's locker rooms because of the counties' fealty to gender ideology. Police in Fairfax didn't arrest him because, under county policy, Cox counted as a woman. The Washington Post gave the story nearly zero coverage because the story of Cox is a reductio ad absurdum of the gender dogma that the outlet follows.

FAMILY UNFRIENDLY HOUSING DISCRIMINATION

To do the right thing, Fairfax prosecutors, Arlington school employees, Fairfax Parks & Recreation officials, and the Washington Post would need to reject their side's professed belief that “transgender women are women.” However, they couldn't reject that belief, so women and girls suffered.

Here, in brief, is the story of how liberals in the suburbs of Washington, D.C., allowed a repeat sex offender to victimize women and stalk children for months.

More than 15 months ago, in June 2024, Cox was charged with indecent exposure for exposing his penis in a female locker room at a Planet Fitness. In his defense, Cox argued, “Transgender people identify as belonging to a gender which may not conform to the sex they were assigned at birth. For a transgender person to be observed in a locker room nude is no proof that this also was anything more than platonic.”

He said he showed the staff at Planet Fitness his Virginia driver's license, which listed him as a woman. In 2020, Virginia Democrats passed a law, lauded by activists as “allow[ing] individuals to go about their daily lives with identification that accurately reflects their identity.”

At the time, county officials knew that Cox was a Tier III sex offender, the most serious level. Cox was charged in the 1990s for allegedly exposing himself to children and masturbating in front of them. He was convicted in Arlington of “taking indecent liberties with children.” He was twice charged with a felony for failing to reregister, but Fairfax County dropped those charges.

All this was a matter of record when Fairfax County dismissed the indecent exposure charge against Cox on July 25. Police said it was because “the victim did not show up” in court.

Set free to roam the Virginia suburbs and armed with a Virginia driver's license declaring him a woman, Cox began a multimonth tour of county-run female locker rooms (often with children present), where he knew liberal county officials would let him in.

In September 2024, an Arlington woman complained that Cox entered the female locker room at Washington-Liberty High School in Arlington, which is shared with the Washington-Liberty Aquatics Center, a pool available for community use.

“We walked into seeing a man changing in the girls locker room,” the woman told local reporter Nick Minock of WJLA. “Completely naked, facing the doorway. My little girl saw it. She was ahead of me, ready to get changed and dried off, and that's the first thing she walked into.”

The woman complained to the pool officials, who were employees of Arlington Public Schools, but they told her Cox was allowed to use the female locker room because he identified as a woman, Minock reported. School officials likewise told WJLA that they allowed Cox into the female locker room because “APS permits pool patrons to access restrooms and facilities that correspond to their gender identity.”

Despite the complaints, nobody stopped Cox, so he kept going.

In October, Cox entered the female locker room at Arlington's Wakefield High School, which is also open to the community for use.

Then, in November, Cox intruded on the female locker rooms in three different Fairfax County recreation centers.

Minock, who has done most of the reporting on Cox's story, asked the Fairfax County police chief in July, “Why hasn't the Fairfax County Police Department charged registered sex offender Richard Cox for allegedly going to rec centers, exposing himself allegedly to women and girls in locker rooms, and visiting Franconia Rec Center that has a licensed pre-school?”

Police Chief Kevin Davis replied, “He was in a shower in a locker room, taking a shower. The policy of Parks & Rec allowed him and other persons to use the locker room of the gender that they identify with. So a crime was not committed. So he was not arrested.”

“He was allowed to be in there,” Davis said. “The policy that Parks & Rec has allows Richard Cox and others like him to use the restroom, locker room of the gender he identifies or she identifies with.”

Eventually, Arlington County arrested Cox and is holding him in custody.

While liberal politicians, bureaucrats, and the police officers who followed their orders directly endangered the public by looking the other way, the Washington Post has almost totally ignored the story.

Cox was first arrested and set free in the summer of 2024. On Jan. 17, 2025, Minock first reported on Cox's autumnal tour of female locker rooms. Plenty of other local media followed Minock. Three weeks later, I noted in these pages that the Washington Post had, so far, totally ignored the story.

Finally, on Feb. 28, six weeks after WJLA first reported the story, the Washington Post ran an article on the case. If you carefully read the story — to date the only story the outlet has run on Cox — you'll notice that no pronouns are used to describe Cox. It's never “he” or “him” or “his,” it's just Cox or Cox's.

The Washington Post cannot, according to its rules, call Cox a “he.” It also cannot follow its rules and call Cox a “she” if it wishes to maintain any credibility.

DEMOCRATS AND THE LIBERAL LONG ASSAULT ON FREE SPEECH

For liberal media, telling the story of Cox presents an untenable dilemma. His case is the reductio ad absurdum of gender ideology, and so the liberal media has handled his story by pretending it doesn't exist.

But those who followed the Left's rules, including Fairfax County Police, Fairfax Parks & Recreation, and Arlington school officials, to name a few, ended up showing how the Left's rules, divorced from all reason and decency, lead to harm.

The Federal Housing Finance Agency is shuttering New York's Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac offices due to state Attorney General Letitia James's alleged “corrupt” actions, the Washington Examiner confirmed.

James has been accused of mortgage fraud by the Trump administration, but has not been charged. President Donald Trump considers her an enemy and has pressed officials to investigate James.

“We are shutting down the two New York offices for Fannie and Freddie as a result of Letitia James' corrupt and dangerous business practices in the state,” a source close to the FHFA told Fox News Digital. 

The FHFA oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which provide “liquidity, stability, and affordability to the mortgage market,” the agency said.

The offices will keep their functions but will not have a physical presence in New York State. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had offices near Midtown Manhattan in New York City.

“We'll still employ New York residents, and we'll still continue to do mortgage loans in New York, of course,” the source added. “But we are going to eliminate our physical presence. And to the extent that we have leases, we are going to be subleasing those.” 

It's unclear what James did specifically to cause the two government-sponsored companies to close their New York offices. 

The New York attorney general drew considerable ire from Trump after she sued him in a civil fraud case and won in court against the president and his companies. Trump was ordered to pay more than $350 million in fines and face other penalties in February 2024.

The allegations of mortgage fraud come from paperwork discrepancies on James's Virginia and New York homes. James allegedly lied on her paperwork, saying her New York property had four units instead of the proper five, which gives her mortgage advantages.

James listed her Virginia property as her primary residence, and allegedly wanted a better mortgage rate, though her job required her to live in New York.

Her lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has denied the allegations and accused the administration of a “crusade” against Democrats.

“Given the cascade of unsubstantiated allegations coming from the Trump Administration on its ‘mortgage fraud' crusade against Democrats, it's no surprise they are having trouble finding an objective and law-abiding prosecutor who would ignore the facts and the evidence to manufacture sham charges,” Lowell said in a statement to ABC News.

“As we have repeatedly said, any impartial and non-political inquiry would conclude Attorney General James did not violate any laws managing her properties,” he added.

TRUMP EYES NEXT TARGETS AS COMEY CHARGES FORESHADOW MORE INDICTMENTS

U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert resigned last month after he was unable to charge James with mortgage fraud. The administration had pushed him to aggressively pursue the case.

Trump insisted that he fired him, telling reporters the same day that James was “very guilty of something, but I really don't know.”

The Treasury Department is considering minting a $1 coin bearing President Donald Trump's likeness on both sides to honor him and commemorate the United States' 250th birthday next year.

A first draft of that coin, which will mark the semiquincentennial anniversary of the nation's founding, depicts Trump's head in profile on one side, above the words "IN GOD WE TRUST" and the dates 1776 and 2026.

The other side of the coin shows a defiant-looking Trump raising his fist, closely matching the pose he struck moments after surviving an assassination attempt at a 2024 presidential campaign rally in Pennsylvania.

The words "FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT," which Trump mouthed to his supporters right after that attack, appear around the edge of that side of the coin.

"No fake news here. These first drafts honoring America's 250th Birthday and @POTUS are real," U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach wrote on X in response to a post touting sketches of the coin.

"Looking forward to sharing more soon, once the obstructionist shutdown of the United States government is over," Beach wrote.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reposted Beach's message from his own X account.

A Treasury spokesperson told CNBC that a final design for a $1 coin to commemorate the anniversary has not yet been selected.

But "this first draft reflects well the enduring spirit of our country and democracy, even in the face of immense obstacles," the spokesperson said, adding, "We look forward to sharing more soon."

Commemorative coins are legal tender, but they are not minted for general circulation, according to the United States Mint.

It was not immediately clear if the government has created any previous commemorative coins or other coins depicting a living president.

A federal law signed by Trump in January 2021 — just a week before his first term in office ended — allows the Treasury secretary to mint $1 coins "with designs emblematic of the United States semiquincentennial" during the year of the anniversary.

But that same law, under a heading on standards for circulating collectible coins, states, "No head and shoulders portrait or bust of any person, living or dead, and no portrait of a living person may be included in the design on the reverse of any coin under subsections (x), (y), and (z)."

Subsection Y refers to the rules about coins for the 250th anniversary.

That language appears in similar forms in other coin-related laws listed on the U.S. Mint's website.

The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco notes, "To avoid the appearance of a monarchy, it was long-standing tradition to only feature portraits of deceased individuals on currency and coin."

"That tradition became law with an 1866 Act of Congress," the Fed bank added.

The Treasury Department did not provide a comment in response to CNBC's questions about the legality of the draft coin.

The U.S. Supreme Court again cleared the way on Friday for Donald Trump's administration to revoke a temporary legal protection for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants in the United States, backing a key priority of the Republican president as he pursues a policy of mass deportations.

The justices granted the administration's request to put on hold a judge's ruling that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem lacked the authority to end the Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, granted to the migrants under Trump's Democratic predecessor Joe Biden while litigation proceeds.

The Supreme Court previously sided with the administration in May to lift a temporary order that San Francisco-based U.S. District Judge Edward Chen issued at an earlier stage of the case that had halted the TPS termination while the litigation played out in court. Chen issued a final ruling on September 5, finding that Noem's actions to terminate the program violated a federal law that governs the actions of federal agencies.

The judge also faulted Noem's "discriminatory statements" concerning the Venezuelans, noting that her generalization of the alleged crimes of a few migrants "to the entire population of Venezuelan TPS holders who have lower rates of criminality and higher rates of college education and workforce participation than the general population is a classic form of racism."

Chen's ruling meant that more than 300,000 Venezuelan TPS holders would be able to remain in the country for now, even though Noem had determined that to be "contrary to the national interest," according to the administration.

Trump has made cracking down on immigration - legal and illegal - a central plank of his second term as president, and has moved to strip certain migrants of temporary legal protections, expanding the pool of possible deportees.

The TPS program is a humanitarian designation under U.S. law for countries stricken by war, natural disaster or other catastrophes, giving recipients living in the United States deportation protection and access to work permits.

The U.S. government under Biden designated Venezuelans as eligible for TPS in 2021 and 2023. Just days before Trump returned to office in January, Biden's administration announced an extension of the program to October 2026.

Noem, a Trump appointee, rescinded that extension and moved to end the TPS designation for a subset of Venezuelans who had benefited from the 2023 designation.

The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to put Chen's final ruling on hold, prompting criticism from the administration, which said it amounted to defiance of the Supreme Court given the prior action by the justices in the case.

"This case is familiar to the court and involves the increasingly familiar and untenable phenomenon of lower courts disregarding this court's orders on the emergency docket," the Justice Department told the Supreme Court in its filing.

Some lower courts have expressed confusion and frustration in recent weeks as they attempt to follow Supreme Court emergency orders that often are issued with little or no legal reasoning presented.

"This court's orders are binding on litigants and lower courts. Whether those orders span one sentence or many pages, disregarding them - as the lower courts did here - is unacceptable," the Justice Department said.

In another case, the Supreme Court on May 30 let the administration revoke a different type of temporary legal status for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan, Cuban, Haitian and Nicaraguan migrants. The justices put on hold another judge's order that had halted the administration's move to end the immigration "parole" granted under Biden to 532,000 of these migrants while a legal challenge played out.

Immigration parole is a form of temporary permission under U.S. law to be in the country for "urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit," allowing recipients to live and work in the United States.

Amazon is closing four more Fresh supermarkets in Southern California as the e-commerce giant continues to focus its grocery strategy around Whole Foods and delivery.

The closures will take place in the coming weeks, Amazon confirmed to CNBC. They follow the shuttering of four other U.S. locations in recent months, in Washington, Virginia, New York and a Los Angeles suburb.

"Certain locations work better than others, and after an assessment, we've made the decision to close these Amazon Fresh locations," Amazon spokesperson Griffin Buch said in a statement. "We're working closely with affected employees to help them find new roles within Amazon wherever possible."

At one Fresh supermarket in La Verne, California, employees were told to gather for an all-hands meeting on Wednesday, according to an internal message viewed by CNBC. They learned at the meeting that the store would close in mid-November, and that employees would receive a severance package, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the details were confidential.

The other three stores that are closing are in cities of Mission Viejo, La Habra and Whittier.

Last week, Amazon said it intends to close 14 Fresh grocery stores in the U.K. and convert its five other locations there into Whole Foods markets.

Amazon said it regularly evaluates its store portfolio, which can lead to opening, reopening, relocating or closing certain locations. In the U.S., the company has more than 60 remaining Fresh stores. Last year, the company removed its "Just Walk Out" cashierless technology from the stores. It's also been culling its footprint of Go cashierless convenience stores.

Amazon has been determined to become a major grocery player for nearly two decades. The company launched Amazon Fresh in 2007, then a pilot project for fresh food delivery, before acquiring upscale chain Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in 2017, its biggest purchase on record.

Amazon debuted its Fresh grocery chain in 2020, with an eye toward mass-market shoppers. The rollout has been turbulent since its early days.

The company opened a flurry of Fresh locations by 2022, but the expansion plans ran into CEO Andy Jassy's widespread cost-cutting efforts as the company reckoned with the impact of rising interest rates and soaring inflation. In 2023, Amazon announced it would shut some Fresh stores and halt further openings temporarily as it evaluated how to make the chain stand out for shoppers.

While it's closing Fresh stores, Amazon continues to "innovate and invest in making grocery shopping easier, faster, and more affordable," Buch said. The company still maintains 500 Whole Foods locations and has opened mini "daily shop" Whole Foods stores in New York City.

Buch said that Amazon serves 150 million U.S. customers with millions of "grocery and everyday essentials available for online delivery, pick-up, or in store shopping."

On Wednesday, Amazon also launched a new "price-conscious" grocery brand that will be offered online and in its physical stores. And last month, Amazon expanded same-day delivery of fresh foods to more pockets of the U.S.

Jassy and other company executives have touted the success of sales of "everyday essentials" within its online grocery business, which refers to items such as canned goods, paper towels, dish soap and snacks. Jassy told investors at the company's annual shareholder meeting in May that he remains "bullish" on grocery, calling it a "significant business" for Amazon.

Sean "Diddy" Combs pleaded for mercy, apologized to his sex trafficking accusers, and said he's learned his lesson before he was sentenced on Friday to over four years in prison for transporting hired male escorts across state lines for "freak offs" with ex-girlfriends.

Donning a cream-colored sweater over a white button-down and black pants, the 55-year-old hip-hop mogul said he's lost his self-respect and hates himself in a speech to US District Judge Arun Subramanian in a packed lower Manhattan courtroom.

"My actions were disgusting, shameful, and sick," Combs said. "I was sick, sick from the drugs. I was out of control. I needed help, but I didn't get the help. Because of that, I could make no excuse. And I can really make no excuse because I knew better."

Combs said that he wanted to apologize to two of his former girlfriends — R&B singer Cassie Ventura and "Jane" — who both played a central role in his criminal trial and who prosecutors alleged he sex-trafficked and coerced into his freak off sex sessions.

"I want to personally apologize, again, to Cassie Ventura for any harm or hurt that I've caused her emotionally or physically," Combs said.

He added, "I would like to apologize to Jane. I didn't mean to hurt you. I'm sorry that I brought you into my mess."

The "I'll Be Missing You" rapper also apologized to his mother, saying, while choking back tears, that he had "failed" her as a son.

Combs told the judge that he's been "humbled and broken to my core."

"I hate myself right now. I've been stripped down for nothing. I really truly am sorry for it all, no matter what they say," he said.

"I want your honor to know that, given the chance, people can change. I know I've changed," said Combs. "I know I'll never put my hands on another person again."

Before Combs addressed the court, six of his children made emotional pleas for why their father should be released from behind bars and told the judge that Combs was a changed man.

"He is still our dad and we still need him present in our lives," Combs' 18-year-old daughter, Jessie, said.

Ahead of his sentencing hearing, Combs urged the judge, in a four-page letter filed with the court on Thursday, to take mercy on him.

"I take full responsibility and accountability for my past wrongs," Combs wrote to Subramanian. "This has been the hardest 2 years of my life, and I have no one to blame for my current reality and situation but myself."

Before the sentencing hearing, several people, including Ventura and a former Combs assistant who accused him of rape, filed impact statements with the court.

Ventura — Combs' ex of more than 10 years and the prosecution's star witness at the rapper's seven-week trial this past summer — asked the judge in her letter to consider the "many lives" Combs has "upended with his abuse and control."

During the trial, the prosecution showed the jury a key piece of evidence — the infamous hotel-beatdown security video showing Combs kicking and dragging Ventura as she tried to leave a freak off.

Combs, in his pre-sentencing letter to the judge, said that "the scene and images of me assaulting Cassie play over and over in my head daily."

Following the sentencing, Ventura's lawyers, Douglas Wigdor and Meredith Firetog, said in a statement: "While nothing can undo the trauma caused by Combs, the sentence imposed today recognizes the impact of the serious offenses he committed."

"We are confident that with the support of her family and friends, Ms. Ventura will continue healing knowing that her bravery and fortitude have been an inspiration to so many," they said.

Combs has been locked up at a notorious federal Brooklyn jail since his September 2024 arrest and indictment, and he was hoping to soon be released with a sentence of time served.

In July, the jury found Combs guilty of two federal counts of transportation to engage in prostitution — known as the Mann Act — but acquitted him of the more severe charges of sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy.

That acquittal allowed Combs to dodge a possible sentence of life in prison.

In clearing Combs of those top charges, the jury rejected the US government's claims that the music tycoon sex trafficked Ventura and another ex of his for his freak off sex encounters, and that he ran a criminal enterprise.

Ventura, who dated Combs on and off between 2007 and 2018, and another ex-girlfriend who testified under the pseudonym "Jane," told the jury during the trial that they were brutally beaten by Combs.

Prosecutors, in their pre-sentencing court filing, argued that Combs "engaged in violence and put others in fear" and should be sentenced to at least 11 years and three months in prison.

Combs' attorneys argued at his trial that the hip-hop and fashion entrepreneur, once worth close to a billion dollars, had a violent side, but was no sex trafficker.

Meta is ramping up the pressure for its employees to use AI.

The Facebook parent company is tracking how extensively its teams are using AI through dashboards it rolled out earlier this year, and it created a game to boost employees' usage, Business Insider has learned.

Expectations around AI usage vary by teams. Staff in some departments are encouraged to play with AI tools, while others are being pushed to meet specific targets, according to four current employees.

Across Big Tech, companies are dangling both carrots and sticks to get employees on board with AI.

At Meta, engineers and staff are nudged to experiment with chatbots through games and badges, and they're also being tracked on dashboards and, in some cases, measured against specific adoption targets. Google is monitoring how many extra hours of productivity its engineers are squeezing out each week from AI tools and encouraging staff to try new tools, as Business Insider previously reported. Microsoft is trying to tie AI use to performance reviews. Other companies are buying software to monitor whether workers are leaning on AI enough.

The message is clear: Play along and be rewarded, or risk being left behind.

"It's well-known that this is a priority and we're focused on using AI to help employees with their day-to-day work," a Meta spokesperson told Business Insider. 

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has publicly said the company is driving hard to use AI more internally. Speaking on Joe Rogan's podcast in January, he said he expected that by the end of 2025, Meta would have AI that can perform to the standard of a midlevel engineer.

On Meta's first-quarter earnings call in April, Zuckerberg shared more on the company's use of AI internally. "I'd expect that by the middle to end of next year, AI coding agents are going to be doing a substantial part of AI research and development," Zuckerberg stated.  

Meta's hardware and virtual reality division, Reality Labs, is aiming to increase employees' usage of AI tools to above 75%, according to two of the people Business Insider spoke to. Currently, the division's usage rate is at 70%, a person familiar with the matter said. In June, the division had reached a utilization rate of 30%, according to two sources.

Meta's software engineers and researchers are using AI assistants to generate code templates or write code to speed up their work, current employees say. In other areas of the business, workers use AI to brainstorm ideas, create collaborative workspaces, ask about company policies, and ask it to make suggestions on a draft, and write.

To spur employees to embrace AI, Meta launched a voluntary program earlier this year called "Level Up" that turns AI adoption into a game. The game is designed to help employees get comfortable working with AI tools and can be accessed through its internal AI chatbot, known as Metamate. Employees are rewarded with badges as they hit different usage level milestones.

Three worker-tracking software providers previously told Business Insider that over the past two years, they've seen demand for monitoring employees' AI usage soar. That's because they want to see if AI adoption pays off and unlocks cost savings or productivity gains.

Spirit Airlines plans to shrink its fleet by nearly 100 aircraft and exit more than a dozen U.S. markets as part of a sweeping bankruptcy restructuring process, CFO Fred Cromer said on Friday during a virtual meeting with creditors.

Spirit Airlines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after a prolonged period of financial strain. The low-cost carrier, which Cromer said currently operates 214 aircraft, is using bankruptcy tools to eliminate unprofitable routes and reduce its network footprint. The strategy is expected to save the company "hundreds of millions of dollars" in costs, Cromer said, allowing it to "support a much smaller and stronger Spirit Airlines."

Spirit said in a statement that it filed a motion with the court on Thursday to reject 87 additional aircraft leases. "The motion is subject to court approval, and we continue to engage with key stakeholders, including our lessors, as part of our ongoing restructuring to position Spirit for the future."

Industry overcapacity among low-cost carriers combined with low passenger demand, significant downward pressure in pricing, and an influx of low-fare seats at legacy airlines led the company to bankruptcy, Cromer said.

"While the industry was hopeful at the beginning of 2025 that there would be a rebound, it didn't happen," he said. "That obviously led to the situation that we're in today."

He did not specify a deadline for the fleet reduction.

"Today, we have 214 airplanes," Cromer said. "We're talking order of magnitude, reducing that by almost 100 aircraft."

In recent weeks, Spirit has announced plans to exit service at more than a dozen U.S. airports, including Hartford, Connecticut, and Minneapolis, Minnesota, and suspended roughly 40 routes as part of its restructuring plan. It is not clear how many of those cuts have already been made.

The company also rejected leases on 27 aircraft from lessor AerCap and terminated 12 airport leases and 19 ground handling agreements.

AerCap will pay Spirit $150 million as part of the deal, which resolves their dispute over a deal covering 36 Airbus planes due for delivery between 2027 and 2028.

The Senate on Friday once again did not pass dueling funding bills that would have kept the three-day-old government shutdown from stretching into next week.

The latest attempts to pass both Republicans' "clean" resolution, which would resume funding at current levels through late November, and Democrats' version, which includes additional health-care funding and other measures, was expected not to succeed.

The same competing resolutions previously failed multiple times in the Senate, including on the eve of the shutdown and after it began Wednesday morning.

The shutdown is now all but guaranteed to drag on until at least Monday.

Both parties' leaders so far have shown more interest in convincing Americans that the other is to blame for the impasse than in working out a compromise.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., on Friday accused his Democratic opponents of being cowed by the far left of their party into obstructing President Donald Trump's agenda.

"It's all about President Trump and the Democrats needing to pick a fight to satisfy their far left political base, far left activist organizations who are the tail wagging the dog right now," Thune said. "That's all this is about."

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said earlier on MSNBC that the president bears responsibility.

Trump "is in the presidential witness protection program — no one can find him when it comes to the government shutdown issue, because he knows he's responsible for having caused it," Jeffries said.

Meanwhile, the funding lapse is expected to lead to the furlough of an estimated 750,000 federal employees and trigger the temporary closure of a slew of government programs and offices.

The Trump administration, which was already working to shrink the size of the government, is warning that the shutdown could lead to permanent layoffs of thousands of federal workers — despite that not happening during prior funding lapses.

Trump said Thursday that Democrats gave him an "unprecedented opportunity" to cut what he described as "Democrat Agencies."

While it was unclear precisely what that meant, Trump's warning came a day after his administration froze $18 billion in Department of Transportation funds for two big infrastructure projects in New York City, and said the Department of Energy had cancelled nearly $8 billion in climate-related projects and other initiatives in 16 states that Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris won in the 2024 election.

On Friday morning, the DOT froze another $2.1 billion in federal funds allocated for Chicago's transit system.

Have you ever wondered how much money the 1% makes?

While the ultrawealthy often hold their fortune in a mix of assets, the salary earned by the top 1% is still sizable — but it might vary largely depending on which state you look at.

While earning $416,310 a year puts you in the top 1% of earners in West Virginia, it takes over a million dollars to be in the top 1% in Connecticut.

A recent SmartAsset study calculated the income needed — or the income floor — to be in the top 1% of earners in each US state, using 2022 IRS tax return data for individual tax filers adjusted to May 2025 dollars using the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index.

The study, which was released in July, also calculated the number of 2022 tax returns for each state that would be considered in the top 1% of earners.

Here's how each US state fared.

Anthropic, the world's second most valuable AI startup, released a big model upgrade this week. I chatted with Alex Albert, head of developer relations, about the news. I also asked him how he uses AI in his personal life.

Albert said he taps Anthropic's Claude chatbot for loads of stuff, but he's been particularly impressed by its "ability with general life administration and management."

Claude, and its sibling Claude Code, can access your entire computer, so Albert sometimes asks the chatbot to diagnose issues with his laptop. In one recent example, Chrome seemed to be running slowly. Claude discovered the browser was using too much memory, and it fixed the issue by itself.

Albert also asked Claude to clean up the digital desktop on his computer. The chatbot sorted images and other random files into relevant groups, created new folders, and put the correct stuff in the right places.

Then there's what Albert called "vibe marketing." Claude can scan your computer for all your files and search through folders and downloads, etc. It can then automatically produce reports and articles based on these digital assets, he explained.

With access to the web, Claude can also make memes and crop images. Albert has used this capability to create some amusing things to post on X, including an animated GIF of sunglasses sliding down on his face.

And Claude can draw art in Excel spreadsheets by automatically filling in cells with different colors. "Excel art is a whole thing," Albert told me. Here's one he had Claude create.

Beyond fun stuff like this, Claude has gotten very good at Excel, according to Ethan Mollick, a Wharton professor who studies AI use. (I don't know spreadsheet formulas well, so I'm particularly excited by this.)

Russia's swelling drone threat has NATO scrambling for new defenses cheaper than missiles and jets — and deployable at scale, a top alliance commander told Business Insider.

Adm. Pierre Vandier, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Transformation, who oversees modernization efforts, said that the alliance is building something like a Walmart of counter-drone capabilities for member states.

One of the promising solutions being tested is a new interceptor drone, which costs roughly the same as its Russian target and is less expensive than a missile launched from a fighter jet, he said.

"We need to find a mass versus mass solution," Vandier said. "We are working on that, and the goal I've given to my team is a cost-efficient solution in order to match the threat."

His comments came just weeks after Russian drones violated Polish airspace during a large-scale attack against Ukraine. Dutch F-35 stealth fighter jets shot down a number of the drones, likely using air-to-air missiles worth several hundred thousand dollars on the low end, significantly more than the target.

The early September incident, widely condemned across Europe, immediately raised questions about NATO air defenses and the cost-efficiency of using fighter jets and missiles to shoot down cheap drones worth just tens of thousands of dollars.

It's a problem that Ukraine is facing nightly, with its soldiers tasked to protect cities from swarms of dozens or hundreds of Russian drones. Air defenders rely on truck-mounted machine guns, helicopters, self-propelled anti-aircraft guns, and other tools to blast threats out of the sky.

Vandier described the Russian drone threat as industrial in scale. The country produces around 4,000 a month at its factories, and Western intelligence has warned that Moscow could soon be able to expand its attacks against Ukraine from hundreds of drones a night to thousands.

Several European officials said the recent drone incursion into Polish airspace was a test of NATO and a probe of its air defenses. The alliance's existing air defense network is mainly focused on targeting expensive and complex threats, such as fighter aircraft or missiles, not cheap drones.

Days after the incursion, NATO allies — including Denmark, France, Germany, and the UK — committed to sending additional fighters and a warship to participate in a new mission to defend the alliance's eastern edge.

Almost immediately after that new Eastern Sentry mission began, fighter jets were scrambled to intercept a Russian drone that had violated Romanian airspace. The responding pilots did not shoot it down, and the drone eventually headed back toward Ukraine.

Using a $1 million missile is fine if it's taking down an $80 million jet, Vandier said. But the ability to mass drones in large-scale attacks has created new complications for NATO, as it had done for Ukraine.

NATO was already testing solutions to counter threats like Russia's Geran-2, a one-way attack munition used frequently against Ukraine, that can be cheap and mass-produced. The incursions into NATO airspace last month have, however, added a fresh sense of urgency to these efforts.

One solution that NATO is eyeing right now is autonomous interceptor drones carrying explosive warheads that can hunt down enemy drones and slam into them. The expectation is for the interceptor drone to cost roughly the same as its target — $20,000 to 40,000 — and have a one-to-one kill ratio, or one interceptor per target.

Vandier said that the interceptor drones need to be produced in large numbers and quickly. First, though, this tech must endure another round of testing later this month before they are presented to NATO allies. Then, it becomes a question of which countries buy the systems and how many are deployed.

"Speed is paramount," Vandier said. NATO countries need something that they can field within weeks or months, not years or decades. Developing this tech is not one and done, though. One of the challenges that Ukraine has had to contend with is that drone technology and tactics are constantly adapting.

"Drones and software change in a matter of weeks," Vandier said. "That means that you don't have a magic bullet that will work for the next 10 years. That means that you need to constantly update. The enemy is updating."

Interceptor drones are not the only solution NATO is looking at; the alliance has also tested radars that can predict trajectories and a wall of small drones to act as a last-resort shield against incoming munitions. And Vandier said directed energy weapons, which use high-power lasers or microwaves, are also under consideration.

NATO militaries do have counter-drone capabilities, and a number of them deployed personnel and systems to Denmark ahead of the European summits this week after the country was forced to temporarily close some of its airports due to drone sightings. However, leadership says more solutions are still needed.

Since the Russian drone incursion into Polish airspace in September, NATO has cast a wider net and expanded its search for more systems. Vandier said the alliance is putting together a "catalogue of solutions" for member states to then browse and purchase for their militaries.

"We are building sort of a c-UAS Walmart," he said, using the term for counter-unmanned aerial systems. "Given the rapid evolution of the threat, the more solutions you have, the more resilience you have, because some solutions may be good today and obsolete tomorrow."

The much-needed modernization of the U.S. Army's battlefield communications network being undertaken by Anduril, Palantir and others is rife with "fundamental security" problems and vulnerabilities, and should be treated as a "very high risk," according to a recent internal Army memo.

The two Silicon Valley companies, led by allies of U.S. President Donald Trump, have gained access to the Pentagon's lucrative flow of contracts on the promise of quickly providing less expensive and more sophisticated weapons than the Pentagon's longstanding arms providers.

But the September memo from the Army's chief technology officer about the NGC2 platform that connects soldiers, sensors, vehicles and commanders with real-time data paints a bleak picture of the initial product.

"We cannot control who sees what, we cannot see what users are doing, and we cannot verify that the software itself is secure," the memo says.

Palantir and Anduril did not comment for this story.

The assessment, seen by Reuters and first reported by Breaking Defense, comes just months after defense drone and software maker Anduril was awarded a $100 million to create a prototype of NGC2 with partners including Palantir, Microsoft and several smaller contractors.

The Army should treat the NGC2 prototype version as “very high risk” because of the “likelihood of an adversary gaining persistent undetectable access," wrote Gabrielle Chiulli, the Army chief technology officer authorizing official.

Despite the early September memo's scathing critique, Leonel Garciga, Army chief information officer and Chiulli's supervisor, said in a statement to Reuters that the report was part of a process that helped in "triaging cybersecurity vulnerabilities" and mitigating them.

In March, the 4th Infantry Division used the system in live-fire artillery training at Fort Carson, Colorado, in an exercise Anduril described as demonstrating faster and more reliable performance than legacy systems.

The Army memo identifies some major security gaps.

The report says the system allows any authorized user to access all applications and data regardless of their clearance level or operational need. As a result, "Any user can potentially access and misuse sensitive" classified information, the memo states, with no logging to track their actions.

Other deficiencies highlighted in the memo include the hosting of third-party applications that have not undergone Army security assessments. One application revealed 25 high-severity code vulnerabilities. Three additional applications under review each contain over 200 vulnerabilities requiring assessment, according to the document.

OpenAI now has two of the top three free apps in Apple's App Store, and its new video generation app Sora has snagged the coveted No. 1 spot.

The artificial intelligence startup launched Sora on Tuesday, and it allows users to generate short-form AI videos, remix videos created by other users and post them to a shared feed. Sora is only available on iOS devices and is invite-based, which means users need a code to access it.

Despite these restrictions, Sora has secured the top spot in the App Store, ahead of Google's Gemini and OpenAI's generative chatbot ChatGPT.

"It's been epic to see what the collective creativity of humanity is capable of so far," Bill Peebles, head of Sora at OpenAI, wrote in a post on X on Friday. "Team is iterating fast and listening to feedback."

Sora is powered by OpenAI's latest video and audio generation model called Sora 2. OpenAI said the model is capable of creating scenes and sounds with "a high degree of realism," according to a blog post. The startup's first video and audio generation model, Sora, was announced in February 2024.

OpenAI said it has taken steps to address potential safety concerns around the Sora app, including giving users explicit control over how their likeness is used on the platform. But some of the initial videos posted to the app, including one that depicts OpenAI CEO Sam Altman shoplifting, have sparked debates about its utility, potential for harm and legality.

"It is easy to imagine the degenerate case of AI video generation that ends up with us all being sucked into an RL-optimized slop feed," Altman wrote in a post on X on Tuesday. "The team has put great care and thought into trying to figure out how to make a delightful product that doesn't fall into that trap, and has come up with a number of promising ideas."

Stock markets are due a "drawdown" in the next year or two after years of being propelled to record highs by an AI frenzy, according to Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon.

"Markets run in cycles, and whenever we've historically had a significant acceleration in a new technology that creates a lot of capital formation, and therefore lots of interesting new companies around it, you generally see the market run ahead of the potential ... there are going to be winners and losers," he said at Italian Tech Week in Turin, Italy, on Friday.

Solomon pointed to the mass adoption of the internet in the late 1990s and early 2000s, which led to the emergence of some of the world's largest companies — but also saw investors lose money to what became known as the "dotcom bubble."

"You're going to see a similar phenomenon here," he said. "I wouldn't be surprised if in the next 12 to 24 months, we see a drawdown with respect to equity markets ... I think that there will be a lot of capital that's deployed that will turn out to not deliver returns, and when that happens, people won't feel good."

An AI boom has gripped global markets in recent years, with a slew of new technologies, multibillion-dollar deals and the continued rise of ChatGPT-developer OpenAI. It's seen investors bet big on the tech and pour capital into stocks such as Microsoft, Alphabet, Palantir and Nvidia.

The buzz around AI has helped to push indexes on Wall Street and beyond to record highs, even as the major U.S. averages were dented earlier this year by President Donald Trump's trade policies. However, as investors have continued to seek out opportunities in AI, concerns have been raised about the possibility of a bubble bursting somewhere down the line.

"I'm not going to use the word bubble, because I don't know, I don't know what the path will be, but I do know people are out on the risk curve because they're excited," Solomon said Friday.

"And when [investors are] excited, they tend to think about the good things that can go right, and they diminish the things you should be skeptical about that can go wrong ... There will be a reset, there will be a check at some point, there will be a drawdown. The extent of that will depend on how long this [bull run] goes," he added.

Solomon is not alone in having concerns about current market levels. Speaking at the same event, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said Friday that artificial intelligence is currently in an "industrial bubble."

And earlier this week, veteran investor Leon Cooperman told CNBC that we are in the late innings of a bull market where bubbles can form — something Warren Buffett had warned about.

Karim Moussalem, chief investment officer of equities at Selwood Asset Management, meanwhile, warned of "enormous risks" on the horizon for the AI trade which could rapidly unravel. "The AI trade is beginning to resemble one of the great speculative manias of market history," Moussalem, who runs a market-neutral equity strategy at the London-based hedge fund, said in a post on LinkedIn.

But while Solomon predicted some money would be lost, he also appeared optimistic about artificial intelligence.

"I sleep very well. I'm not going to bed every night worried about what will happen next," Solomon said Friday. "Generally speaking, I think what's super exciting is the technology is expanding, new companies are being formed, and the potential of this technology deployed into the enterprise can be very, very powerful. So, it's an exciting time."

The Trump administration on Friday froze $2.1 billion in Department of Transportation funding for two projects to improve Chicago's transit system.

The DOT in a statement blamed Congress' two Democratic leaders — Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries — for the federal government shutdown, which the department claimed would slow a review of the Chicago projects to ensure they do not involve "unconstitutional practices" related to the race or gender of construction workers.

That statement echoed a Trump administration talking point that Democrats in Congress are refusing to vote for a short-term funding agreement that would reopen the government because they insist on providing health-care benefits for "illegal immigrants."

Democrats call that claim a lie designed to distract from their goal of continuing the offer of enhanced Affordable Care Act health insurance plan subsidies to more than 20 million Americans.

"At a time when federal agents are sowing chaos in Chicago, the Trump administration is holding bipartisan funding hostage," Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said in a social media post on X after the DOT's announcement.

"It's attempting to score political points but is instead hurting our economy and the hardworking people who rely on public transit to get to work or school," wrote Pritzker, who, like Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, is a Democrat.

Johnson, in a statement, said, "Argentina gets $20 billion and the South Side gets nothing. What happened to America First?" The mayor's comment referenced a Trump administration officer to bolster Argentina's sputtering economy with a $20 billion credit line, and a Chicago neighborhood relying on one of the transit improvement projects.

"South Siders have waited for more than 50 years for the Red Line Extension," Johnson said, referring to a project that would extend that train line by 5.5 miles with four new stations.

"This project will bring 25,000 jobs to the Chicago area and billions in new development. The Red Line Extension is the single largest investment in the Far South Side in a generation," he said.

"Right when we are finally on the brink of moving forward, Trump just cut off the funding," Johnson said. "From public safety to public education to public transit, this president is cutting the services that working people rely upon."

Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought first announced the freeze on the Chicago projects on Friday morning.

It was the third time in recent days that he revealed funding actions by the Trump administration targeting cities and states led by Democrats.

President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers have blamed Democrats in Congress for the shutdown, which hit its third day on Friday.

Trump said on Thursday that the shutdown had given him an "unprecedented opportunity" to cut what he called "Democrat Agencies."

Vought on Wednesday revealed that the Department of Transportation was freezing $18 billion in federal funding for two major infrastructure projects in New York City. Both Schumer and Jeffries are from New York City.

Later that same day, Vought said that the Department of Energy had cancelled nearly $8 billion in funding for climate-related projects and other efforts in 16 states, all of which were won by Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.

On Friday, Vought, in a post on X, wrote, "$2.1 billion in Chicago infrastructure projects -- specifically the Red Line Extension and the Red and Purple Modernization Project -- have been put on hold to ensure funding is not flowing via race-based contracting."

Both projects are overseen by the Chicago Transit Authority, which operates the city's train and bus system.

The Red and Purple Modernization Project is reconstructing infrastructure along those color train lines.

The U.S. DOT later Friday said, "This week, USDOT issued an interim final rule (IFR) barring race- and sex-based contracting requirements from federal grants."

"To continue implementation of this rule, USDOT today sent letters to the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) to inform them that" the two CTA projects "are also under administrative review to determine whether any unconstitutional practices are occurring," the DOT said.

The DOT in its statement said the freeze on the Chicago money "is in addition to reviews of New York's Second Avenue Subway and Hudson Tunnel projects," the department said. "Illinois, like New York, is well known to promote race- and sex-based contracting and other racial preferences as a public policy."

The DOT also said that Americans "don't care what race or gender construction workers, pipefitters, or electricians are. They just want these massive projects finally built quickly and efficiently."

"Unfortunately, Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries' decision to shut down the government has negatively affected the Department's staffing resources for carrying out this important analysis," the department said.

"We urge Democrats in Congress to stop holding the federal government's budget hostage so USDOT can get back to the important work of the American people," the DOT said.

"Benefits for illegal immigrants are not worth potential impacts to important investments in our nation's transportation infrastructure," the department said.

TURIN, Italy — Artificial intelligence is currently in an "industrial bubble" but the technology is "real" and will bring big benefits to society, Amazon Founder Jeff Bezos said on Friday.

The term bubble usually refers to a period of inflated stock prices or valuations of companies that have disconnected from the fundamentals of a business. One of the most famous bubbles that burst was the 2000 dotcom crash where the value of internet companies plummeted.

Exor CEO John Elkann asked Bezos on stage at Italian Tech Week in Turin, Italy whether there were signs that the current AI industry is in bubble.

"This is a kind of industrial bubble," the Amazon founder said.

Bezos laid out some of the key characteristics of bubbles, noting that when they happen, stock prices are "disconnected from the fundamentals" of a business.

"The second thing that happens is that people get very excited like they are today about artificial intelligence," Bezos added.

During bubbles, every experiment or idea gets funded, he told the audience.

"The good ideas and the bad ideas. And investors have a hard time in the middle of this excitement, distinguishing between the good ideas and the bad ideas. And that's also probably happening today," Bezos said.

"But that doesn't mean anything that is happening isn't real. AI is real, and it is going to change every industry."

Bezos gave the example of a six-person company receiving billions of dollars of funding. This is "very unusual behavior" and yet this kind of activity is happening today, he said without making it clear what company he was referring to.

The billionaire however, said that ultimately industrial bubbles could be positive. He pointed to the biotech and pharmaceutical company bubble in the 1990s, which led to the development of some life-saving drugs even though many companies eventually went bust.

"The [bubbles] that are industrial are not nearly as bad, it can even be good, because when the dust settles and you see who are the winners, societies benefits from those inventions," Bezos said.

"That is what is going to happen here too. This is real, the benefits to society from AI are going to be gigantic."

Bezos is not the only major business figure warning about an AI bubble. In August, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman reportedly said the AI market is in a bubble, and many investors have also raised the issue.

Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon on Friday expressed some concerns about stock market levels amid the AI hype.

"When [investors are] excited, they tend to think about the good things that can go right, and they diminish the things you should be skeptical about that can go wrong ... There will be a reset, there will be a check at some point, there will be a drawdown," Solomon said at Italian Tech Week. "The extent of that will depend on how long this [bull run] goes."

Karim Moussalem, chief investment officer of equities at Selwood Asset Management, said last week that the "AI trade is beginning to resemble one of the great speculative manias of market history."

With a Georgetown University degree and several internships under her belt, Christina Salvadore thought she'd be starting a career in New York City's fashion or beauty industries around now. The problem: She can't find a job.

The 23-year-old hasn't been able to land a full-time role despite filling out hundreds of applications and taking dozens of networking calls since graduating in the spring. She's currently applying to part-time gigs to tide her over financially.

"It definitely sucks when people are like, 'So what are you doing now?,'" Salvadore, a Florida native, told CNBC. "I'm sitting in my parents' house on LinkedIn 24 hours a day."

A growing body of data shows Salvadore isn't alone. Young college grads are having a uniquely difficult time trying to clinch their first full-time jobs and feeling the brunt of the weakening labor market.

On a macro level, this group's tough luck is moving the needle in broader data sets that are used in part by economists and monetary policymakers to determine the health of the economy. For the hundreds of thousands of Americans in this camp, it's altering their visions for what they thought this era of life would look like.

The unemployment rate for "new entrants," a group that includes recent college grads and others trying to break in to the full-time workforce, hit a nine-year peak this year, federal data shows. The group's share of the total unemployed population spiked to its highest percentage in decades.

Put simply: The U.S. has become "no country for young grads," according to Gad Levanon, chief economist at Burning Glass Institute, and his team at the labor-focused think tank.

In a report published this summer, Levanon and his team found that the bachelor's degree isn't delivering on its "fundamental promise" of access to white-collar jobs for the first time in modern history. The once-lauded path from college campus to career, the team concluded, is increasingly less reliable.

After Levanon fielded questions about whether the trend was affecting all young workers or just those with college diplomas, he conducted further analysis of federal data. It shows 20- to 24-year-olds with bachelor's degrees have seen the most extreme levels of unemployment compared with historical levels than other educational groups.

Bachelor's degree holders in this age bracket have long benefited from a lower unemployment rate compared with those with just high school diplomas. But Levanon's data shows the gap between the two groups is the smallest it has been since at least the early 2000s.

"You clearly see here something unusual for the bachelor's degree," Levanon told CNBC.

On popular social media platform TikTok, young adults fresh out of college have made the trials and tribulations associated with finding their first post-grad job a sort of subgenre. They're documenting the journey and lamenting the discouragement they feel. They're moving home with their parents. They're questioning why entry-level job postings require several years of experience. They're wondering why companies "ghost" them, meaning they never get a response to an application.

Several have used the slang phrase "crashing out" to describe how they're faring emotionally.

"I feel like I'm behind right now," said recent Boston College grad Michael Hartman, who said he recently sought insight from a psychic about his career trajectory after around 10 months of unsuccessful job hunting. Hartman has an economics degree and has been seeking a consulting or business strategy role.

This turn of fortune for America's newest college grads has caught the attention of top economic policymakers and comes amid mounting concerns about the labor market at large.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged a few weeks ago that young people are having a harder time locking down work. He pointed to a "low-firing, low-hiring environment," a landscape that economists have said makes it particularly tough for those looking to break into the full-time workforce.

The number of workers getting hired and quitting slowed in August, according to government data released Tuesday. Figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released in September show the number of people staying unemployed for at least 27 weeks has ballooned around 25% year over year on a seasonally adjusted basis. Federal labor data previously expected to be released this week is on hold for the duration of the government shutdown.

Burning Glass' Levanon said the problem stems in part from the rising share of young Americans obtaining four-year degrees. The demand for workers with this education level isn't keeping up, he said, meaning current conditions may not improve anytime soon.

This could result in a hit to college enrollment as young people realize higher education is not the career pipeline it once was, Levanon added.

On top of that, the rise of artificial intelligence has raised alarms that entry-level, knowledge-worker roles will be automated away.

In August, Stanford published a bombshell study finding U.S. workers ages 22 to 25 in jobs most exposed to AI have seen a 13% decline in employment since 2022. Anecdotally, executives at companies ranging from Walmart to Accenture have said the technology will drastically reshape their labor forces.

Tightening in the labor market has made an entire generation more worried about what the future will hold. Reported probability of losing a job over the next five years among 18- to 34-year-olds in May jumped to highs last seen in 2013, according to University of Michigan data.

These concerns have changed the outlook for recent and soon-to-be college grads alike. After seeing friends struggle to secure employment, student Emma Zatkulak began firing off applications several weeks earlier than she previously anticipated. The 21-year-old finds herself scheduling interviews for sales and insurance roles in between a full class load and two jobs.

"It's been very stressful," said Zatkulak, who is in her final semester as a communications major at Boise State University in Idaho. "I have not felt calm in a couple months."

However, not all new grads may be feeling this shift to the same extent.

On job board Indeed, software development job listings are at around 66% of the volume seen before the Covid pandemic. On the other hand, nursing position postings are up about 16% compared with the same baseline.

"It's a real phenomenon," said Laura Ullrich, Indeed's director of economic research for North America. "But at the same time, I do not think it applies to all students or all young people. It depends on what sector they're working in."

Still, Ullrich acknowledged that there's reason for young adults' anxiety. She pointed to an analysis by Moody's Analytics that found fewer tracked industries have added jobs over the last six months than removed them, which has historically only happened during and around recessions.

In the technology industry, the decline in entry-level hiring is particularly clear. The share of hires with little work experience has plunged more than 50% at large-cap tech companies between 2019 and 2024, according to venture capital firm SignalFire. At startups, that number has dropped more than 47%.

Young job seekers told CNBC that the difficulty of finding a job has brought up feelings of social isolation and self-doubt. As rejections pile up, they said it can become hard not to take it personally.

Over recent months, Julia Vasedkova has watched fellow graduates from Tennessee's Rhodes College start their new lives as young professionals. Meanwhile, Vasedkova has been in a state of self-described "limbo" with only a part-time job, despite sending off hundreds of applications. The English major has applied for teaching, publishing and social media positions.

The 24-year-old finds herself turning down invitations for social gatherings to conserve money for rent and other expenses. It's also time that she could be spending trying to find the increasingly elusive post-grad job, anyway.

"It's definitely exhausting. Some days, it feels like I have a full-time job just to apply for jobs," Vasedkova said. "It just feels like I don't really have a life outside of that."

OnePay, the fintech firm majority-owned by Walmart, will soon offer cryptocurrency trading and custody on its mobile app, CNBC has learned.

OnePay will offer customers access to bitcoin and ether later this year with help from the startup Zerohash, according to people with knowledge of the matter who declined to be identified before an official announcement.

The move shows that OnePay, founded by Walmart and venture firm Ribbit Capital in 2021, sees crypto as a core offering as it builds out its "everything app" for digital finance.

The fintech firm has methodically added new products in its quest to become an American super app akin to overseas offerings like WeChat. The company now offers banking services including high-yield savings accounts; credit and debit cards; buy now, pay later loans and even wireless plans.

By allowing OnePay users to hold bitcoin and ether in their mobile app, customers could presumably convert their crypto into cash and then use those funds to make store purchases or pay off card balances.

Spokespeople for New York-based OnePay and Chicago-based Zerohash declined to comment.

Crypto continues to gain mainstream adoption after the U.S. government's stance towards the nascent technology flipped with the election of President Donald Trump. Big banks that couldn't previously develop crypto offerings are now starting to do so; last month Morgan Stanley said it would soon offer retail clients direct access to crypto through its E-Trade subsidiary.

The overall trend has boosted a constellation of public and private companies involved in crypto. Last month, Zerohash raised $104 million in funding from financial firms including Morgan Stanley and Interactive Brokers, part of its strategy to enmesh itself with banks and brokers that are building crypto products.

For OnePay, which benefits from its ties with the world's largest retailer, there are signs that its mobile app is gaining traction, even before the crypto rollout.

The fintech firm is now No. 5 on Apple's app store ranking for free finance apps, ahead of larger companies including JPMorgan Chase, Robinhood and Chime. Nearly all the apps ahead of OnePay in that list, including PayPal, Venmo and Cash App, already offer crypto.

From the time it was created, OnePay's big advantage was in its distribution channel. The firm's app is integrated into the in-person and online checkout process at Walmart's U.S. locations, giving it access to the 150 million Americans who shop there every week.

But OnePay was created as an entity separate from the retailer so it wouldn't be limited to only Walmart customers, instead appealing to the broader population of Americans who are underserved by traditional banks.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Myra Deshmukh, the 39-year-old founder of Leadership Lab and a former Amazon employee living in Montclair, New Jersey. It has been edited for length and clarity.

In the 10 ½ years I worked at Amazon, I held many different titles. My last role was senior manager of learning and development programs, and one of my tasks was to teach a business writing course to thousands of Amazon employees.

Overall, Amazon has a very heavy writing culture, so we write a lot of documents, emails, memos, press releases, and FAQs.

The course I taught was a six-week foundations course in business writing 101, and covered how to write concisely, tell compelling stories, and structure writing — from Slack chats and emails to a six-pager.

Email is one of the primary ways we communicate today, and how you show up in an email can make a real difference in how others perceive you.

Here are seven things you can try in order to improve your email communication.

The subject line is incredibly important; it lets the reader know the purpose of your email, and is the first impression they get of you.

When writing one, make it as specific and helpful as possible.

If it's just for their information, include "FYI" in the subject. If action is required, add the deadline or the task itself so the recipient immediately understands the urgency and intention of your message.

For example, a good subject line is: Marketing Proposal - Feedback Needed by 8/13. A bad example is: Marketing Proposal Draft.

Second to the subject line, a greeting is one of the first impressions somebody will have of you. You don't want it to be the reason that someone has a negative perception of you.

If you want to come off as professional or neutral, use "hi" or "hello." It's the most neutral greeting and is the least likely to be misunderstood by your recipient.

I avoid using "Dear ___," in work situations, as it's a very personal greeting, like something I'd use when writing to a close relative. I also wouldn't use "hey," as it's very casual and can come across as too informal to different generations or cultures.

Not using a greeting and just writing their name could be perceived as too curt.

After the initial correspondence, it can be appropriate to drop the greeting when responding to an email.

But tailor to your audience; if it's with my manager, I may drop the greeting to answer their questions directly, but if it's with my skip level or higher, I may keep the greeting for some formality and respect.

Before writing an email, you should know the purpose of what you're writing; your email should be concise and specific. You should have one objective, not a million.

This might look like: "Hi name, I hope you're well today. Can you give me feedback on this proposal by the end of the day tomorrow?" From there, you can provide context.

By writing it this way, you're not leaving people to read through and figure out the point of the email.

The bulk of your email should fit into your iPhone screen, and the general gist of your email should just be one scroll. This is especially true if you're writing for an ask, for feedback, or something that you need somebody to reply to.

We use filler words or phrases to soften the ask, or to make an email more personal, but it really just comes across as less confident.

These might read, "I'm writing you because I'm hoping…" or, "I'm wondering if you can…"

Instead, try: "Can you send me feedback on this marketing proposal by the end of the day, [insert date]," and then add some context. This way, it becomes more of an action or direct ask, versus a passive statement.

If it's not an ask, but rather, you're telling someone information, you could say, "The marketing campaign that we ran last week was very successful; it exceeded our revenue goal."

Some people use filler words to be kind, but you can balance being kind with being concise. You can include a short intro, like, "Hope you had a great weekend," but don't make it so long that it distracts from the purpose of your email.

Most people are busy and want you to get to the point of what you're asking.

When it comes to emailing someone, I'd suggest staying away from emojis for the same reason you avoid language that's too casual — it can be misinterpreted.

For example, you might send a winky face with a completely platonic intention, but the person reading it could think, "Why are they winking at me? That's creepy."

You just never know with emojis, so I'd recommend staying away from them. It's very hard to read tone over email, harmless emojis included.

I think punctuation like exclamation points is fine in an email if you're trying to convey excitement or enthusiasm. That said, don't overuse them. Use one.

For example, "We're so excited about tomorrow's launch!" is totally appropriate, but "We're so excited about tomorrow's launch!!!" isn't necessary.

Use your judgment on how many you need for the whole email. As with any special formatting, use it intentionally. If every sentence in your email has an exclamation, it loses emphasis.

It's the same with bolding; if everything is bolded, nothing stands out.

After sending your original email, it's appropriate to follow up after the date you asked them for feedback by.

You could say, "Hey, just following up on this, I would love your feedback."

If you weren't clear about when you needed an answer, you might write: "Hi. I just realized I didn't send you a deadline. I would love the feedback by tomorrow, if you can."

People fear being annoying, but if you think about all the emails you get, of course, a few might slip by that you forget to reply to. Putting yourself in the other person's shoes, you realize a reminder isn't annoying — it can be really helpful.

When writing an email, you should always write it as if it's going to be forwarded to that person's boss. Even if you're friends, you don't want to come off too casual or inappropriate.

Good communication helps you be seen as a great leader at work and makes you more likely to get promoted.

If you have to invest in one skill to enhance your career, invest in clear, effective communication — and that includes email.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Christopher Zhang, 27, the founder of Cryozone China. His words have been edited for length and clarity.

I left high school two months into my senior year. I believed my path didn't have to be high school to college to job to rat race. I'd always been different, and that difference gave me the determination to eventually open my own business in China.

I grew up in Shanghai, and before dropping out in 2016, I spent most of my free time working part-time jobs: English-Mandarin translator, assistant for a nightclub owner, PA for A-list celebrities, and even a venture capital intern.

I never saw higher education as the only road to financial success or — more importantly — happiness. I wanted out of the race and to chart my own course.

My Asian parents, two high-performing executives with degrees from top universities, didn't support their only son dropping out. They figured it was just a "gap year."

But when I started succeeding at work, they ultimately accepted my decision.

Within a week of dropping out of school, I had an interview that turned into a job offer. That's how I started as an account manager at Toplist China, a SaaS company.

In just over a year, before I turned 20, I was promoted to business development manager. I felt challenged but supported, and I had the freedom to grow. I managed bigger budgets, took on new clients, and stepped up to more responsibility.

Work slowed down during COVID-19, so I threw myself into fitness. I've always been into sports; I've played rugby since I was 10 and dealt with all the injuries that come with it.

I started researching injury prevention and recovery methods and got curious about cryotherapy. One night in November 2020, I was up late reading about its benefits when a friend messaged me asking if I knew of any cryotherapy offerings in Shanghai.

That's when I realized I wasn't the only person in a city of 25 million who was interested in it. If the demand was already there, I wanted to be the one to fill that gap. That's where the idea for my company came from.

In April 2021, I founded CryoZone Recovery Hub, a cryotherapy center in Shanghai. These days, in peak season, we see about a dozen customers a day. In the offseason, there are usually fewer. One session costs 350 to 425 yuan, or $50 to $60 for three to five minutes in the chamber. There are clients who add on additional services, which can extend a visit to an hour.

At first, I continued working at Toplist while building my new business on the side. For eight months, I barely slept. But as things started to take off, I shifted to consulting for Toplist.

By 2022, I'd phased out Toplist entirely and started expanding revenue streams: partnering with manufacturers to build and sell affordable, high-quality cryotherapy chambers worldwide, and I opened a second location in Shenzhen. Life is busier now but more flexible. Every decision I make shapes the company, and that accountability is both daunting and exhilarating.

The launch wouldn't have happened without an investor and mentor I met at a luxury watch convention. When a bad supplier set us back, we had to invest another $100,000 on top of the $120,000 we'd already spent to switch to a local factory that could actually support us.

Plenty of "great business ideas" never make it past the bar counter. I was lucky to have a partner who trusted me and backed me financially through the bumps. Making a living while providing my community with an extra option for a healthy lifestyle has kept me focused and assured me that this is the right path.

My favorite quote is a reply from Elon Musk on words of encouragement for entrepreneurs: "If you need encouragement to start a company, don't do it." Reflecting on my career so far, I've learned that success isn't just about financial gain, it's about creating something meaningful and finding encouragement in that.

I'm living proof that the path to fulfillment can be different for everyone.

ByCharles Lloyd Bovaird II,

Senior Contributor.

Bitcoin prices came close to setting a fresh, all-time high on Friday, October 3 as intense demand and growing momentum placed upward pressure on the digital currency. 

The world's largest cryptocurrency by total market value rose to nearly $124,000, according to Coinbase data from TradingView. 

At this point, the digital asset was trading at its most inflated value since August, additional Coinbase figures from TradingView reveal. 

Several analysts focused on the compelling momentum that bitcoin enjoyed as of late. 

“We are in one of the most momentum-driven markets I've ever seen,” George Kailas, CEO of Prospero.ai, said via email. “Recently, that momentum has been fueled by growing confidence that rate cuts will continue.” 

“Adding to Bitcoin's typical bull momentum from lower rates is the perception that it serves as a hedge against government dysfunction,” he continued. “Whether or not that belief is truly valid remains unclear, but in a momentum-driven market, perception itself appears to be driving this surge in Bitcoin.” 

Brett Sifling, wealth manager for Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, also weighed in on bitcoin's current situation, emphasizing through emailed comments that “There are a few reasons why I think it's building momentum.” 

“Most recently, softer than expected U.S. jobs data (ADP numbers) has been connected to raising the odds of an October Fed rate cut,” he noted. “Lower rates means that risk-on assets like Bitcoin will generally be viewed favorably by market participants.” 

“We continue to see solid demand for the spot ETFs and I think that is creating a nice support for Bitcoin to build on top of,” added Sifling. 

“We're also entering October, which in the crypto community is called, ‘Uptober' as it's been a seasonably favorable month for Bitcoin throughout its history,” he added. 

“Given all these positives, along with the government shutdown, it makes sense to me that Bitcoin would be catching a bid and making new highs,” Sifling concluded. 

One analyst in particular claimed that a range of bullish variables have been driving bitcoin's latest gains. 

“Bitcoin's surge toward $124,000 reflects a mix of factors,” Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager BitBull Capital, said via email. 

“Strong inflows into spot ETFs and institutional demand are providing steady buying pressure, while expectations of Fed easing have boosted appetite for risk assets,” he added. 

“At the same time, U.S. political uncertainty and supply constraints following the halving have reinforced the ‘digital gold' narrative,” DiPasquale continued. 

“With momentum traders piling in as Bitcoin nears its prior all-time high, the rally has become self-reinforcing.” 

Julio Moreno, head of research for CryptoQuant, focused on the Coinbase Premium Index, defined as “The [percent] difference between Coinbase Pro price (USD pair) and Binance price(USDT pair),” as well as its implications for investor demand in the U.S. 

The chart below helps illustrate these developments: 

“This price upward movement has been mostly supported by a relatively higher investor demand in the US, as seen by an increasing Bitcoin price premium on Coinbase, which is at the highest level since June 7,” he said via Telegram. 

“US investor demand is what typically drives Bitcoin price rallies during bull markets,” added Moreno. 

Tim Enneking, managing partner of Psalion, offered his two cents on bitcoin's current situation, emphasizing how much it stands out. 

“With the ever-growing number of companies, countries and other entities increasing their purchases of BTC, to say nothing of the fact that the United States may join the list of purchasers, what is remarkable about BTC almost hitting a new ATH is not that it is close to doing so, but that it still has not done so with all of the upside pressure!” he stated via email. 

“After all, for most of this year, the number of BTC purchased by public institutions has significantly exceeded the number generated by miners,” he noted. 

“Given such a supply-and-demand dynamic, the price really only has one direction to go.”

Coinbase (COIN) said on Friday it has applied for a national trust charter with the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), a move that would put the firm under federal regulatory oversight if approved.

The charter would allow Coinbase to build on its existing custody business by offering services such as payments and settlement, without seeking a charter as a full-service bank.

"Coinbase has no intention of becoming a bank," Greg Tusar, vice president of institutional product at Coinbase, said in a blog post. "It is our firm belief that clear rules and the trust of our regulators and customers enable Coinbase to confidently innovate while ensuring proper oversight and security."

Today, the U.S. crypto exchange's main regulated custody service is run through Coinbase Custody Trust Company (CCTC), which is licensed under New York state's BitLicense regime. That framework, introduced in 2015, was one of the earliest state-level regulatory models for crypto in the U.S.

A federal trust charter would give the company more flexibility to launch new financial services such as crypto payments without needing state-by-state approvals.

Coinbase's move follows a slew of crypto companies, including Circle, Ripple and Paxos, applying for federal supervision this year.

Six XRP ETF filings are due Oct. 18–25; we trace the paperwork and model flows, liquidity, and price impact.

Six spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) await SEC approval in the US, with final deadlines for October, and they can reshape market conditions following their debut.

The regulatory backdrop underwent a significant change on Sept. 17, when the SEC approved generic listing standards for crypto-related ETFs across major exchanges.

As a result, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted on Sept. 29 that approvals on altcoin ETFs are not a matter of “if,” but “when.”

However, timing still depends on Washington. During the federal shutdown, the SEC is operating with a skeleton crew and does not process registration statements, pausing the launches of ETFs until funding resumes.

Once staff return, effectiveness orders can be reassessed, meaning an October approval is still plausible.

The regulatory backdrop suggests that Bitwise, 21Shares, WisdomTree, Canary Capital, CoinShares, and Grayscale will launch their XRP products on Cboe this month. Consequently, the move will restructure the XRP market.

How much money could flow is a live debate, but several guideposts exist. Market researchers suggested as much as $8 billion in first-year inflows, with CryptoQuant's Julio Moreno estimating ETFs could absorb 1% to 4% of circulating supply.

Meanwhile, Bitget's Jamie Elkaleh estimated the $4 billion to $8 billion range as a realistic base case.

JPMorgan's January framework, extrapolated from Bitcoin and Ethereum penetration, projected 3% to 6% of market cap converted into inflows.

XRP traded at $3.05 as of press time, which implies roughly $5.5 billion to $11 billion in year-one net creations.

In the battle to capture capital flows in this billion-dollar market, fee competition and distribution strategies are crucial. Lower expense ratios and broad brokerage access historically correlate with stronger early flows.

Regarding investor positioning, retail investors are likely to dominate the first-year inflows if XRP is to replicate the movements of spot Bitcoin ETFs. A K33 February research highlighted that 25.4% of spot Bitcoin ETF assets under management are held by institutions.

Launch day price action demands nuance. Bitcoin's US spot ETFs triggered a “sell the news” stretch, as BTC tumbled 7.5% on the day following the products' launch and risked losing the $40,000 threshold.

Ethereum's spot ETF debut saw a similar movement, with a 4.25% decline the day after its launch. In a larger timeframe, Bitcoin quickly climbed to a local top of nearly $74,000 two months later, while Ethereum continued to nosedive until early October.

However, Bitcoin's movement occurred in a bullish environment for the entire market, while the Ethereum ETF aftermath took place during a significant correction period. As a result, it is challenging to predict XRP's price action, although a sell-the-news event is likely to happen, considering past events.

What is almost certain to change is XRP's market plumbing. Glassnode documented how US spot ETFs have become a structural “supply absorber” for Bitcoin and Ethereum on their weekly reports.

The exchange-traded products capture net creations that remove coins from the liquid float. When ETF demand cools, fragility rises. Conversely, when flows resume, drawdowns stabilize as supply tightens.

An XRP complex would likely replicate that cadence, with steady creations capturing inventory inside funds, shifting price discovery toward the pace of advisor and retail allocations, and reducing sensitivity to purely crypto-native liquidity cycles.

With the crypto ETF rule change in place and the paperwork live, the core question for XRP ETFs is not about a potential approval, but how the first wave of flows reshapes XRP's market dynamics.

 The plaintiffs failed to show how Bored Ape Yacht Club and other NFTs represent investment contracts under the SEC's 3-pronged Howey Test. 

A US judge has dismissed an investor lawsuit against Web3 company Yuga Labs, ruling that the case failed to show non-fungible tokens (NFTs) meet the legal definition of securities.Judge Fernando M. Olguin ruled the plaintiffs did not demonstrate how Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), ApeCoin (APE) or other NFTs sold by Yuga satisfied the three conditions of the Howey test, a standard used by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to determine whether a transaction qualifies as an investment contract. The lawsuit was originally filed in 2022.

Yuba Labs marketed its NFTs as digital collectibles with membership perks to an exclusive club, making them consumables rather than investment contracts, Olguin said. He wrote:

The judge also said the plaintiffs failed to show that the Bored Ape Yacht Club and other NFT collections launched by Yuga are a “common enterprise” with the expectation of profits produced by others, adding legal precedent that most digital assets are not securities.

The NFTs, which trade on public blockchain networks, did not establish an ongoing and dependent financial link between the purchaser and Yuga Labs, and do not qualify as a “common enterprise” under the Howey Test, Olguin said.

Investors who purchased NFTs from the company paid a fee to Yuga that was independent of the NFT prices, Consensys attorney Bill Hughes wrote on X.

Finally, Olguin ruled that Yuga Labs did not make explicit promises of profit to prospective NFT buyers and that the roadmap for the project did not satisfy the conditions under the Howey test of expectation of profit.

“Statements about a product's inherent or intrinsic value are not necessarily statements about profit,” Olguin said.

“Statements about NFT prices and trade volumes are a somewhat closer call, but even then, these statements by themselves fail to establish an expectation of profit,” he added.

A new law allows for people who have been the victim of a scam involving the use of virtual currency kiosks — often referred to as Bitcoin ATMs — to receive a full refund of their money, and one law enforcement agency reports it's already putting the law to use.

Rogers police sent out a news release Thursday about Act 557 of 2025, which allows people get their money back from the kiosks if people follow the proper procedures.

According to the Federal Trade Commission, Bitcoin ATMs are machines that look like a traditional ATM and are often found at convenience stores, gas stations and other high-traffic areas. But instead of distributing cash, the machines accept cash in exchange for cryptocurrency.

Data from the commission show from 2020 to 2023, consumers lost more than $110 million in scams involving Bitcoin ATMs. The commission reports the use of the ATMs by scammers, who urge consumers to deposit cash into them to protect their savings, is on the rise.

Don Lisi, Rogers Police Department spokesman, said police investigate cases involving virtual currency scams on a regular basis, and the department is currently handling a couple of such cases. However, he said he could not discuss the details of those cases.

Act 557 states: “The owner of a virtual currency kiosk or a virtual currency kiosk operator shall allow a new customer, upon the request of the new customer, to cancel and receive a full refund for any fraudulent virtual currency transactions that occurred not later than seventy-two hours after the new customer registered as a customer of the owner of the virtual currency kiosk or the virtual currency kiosk operator if, not later than fourteen days after the last virtual currency transaction that occurred during the seventy-two hour period, the new customer:

“(1) contacts the owner of the virtual currency kiosk or the virtual currency kiosk operator and a government or law enforcement agency to inform the owner of the virtual currency kiosk or the virtual currency kiosk operator and government or law enforcement agency of the fraudulent nature of the virtual currency transaction; and

“(2) files a report with a government or law enforcement agency memorializing the fraudulent nature of the virtual currency transaction.”

The law took effect Aug. 5, and Rogers police detectives have already begun assisting victims of virtual kiosk scams in getting their money refunded, according to Thursday's release.

Detectives will not be able to assist people with previous cases since the law is not retroactive, the release states.

Lisi urged people to remain vigilant.

“If someone is calling you, texting you, messaging you online, etc., and trying to get you to send them money in any form, please be wary of these folks,” he said. “If you think it is a scam, please hang up or stop communicating with them and contact law enforcement. If someone contacts you claiming to be a law enforcement officer and is asking for some sort of payment, that is a scam. Law enforcement officers will never attempt to collect money from you for any reason.”

ACTIONS ELSEWHERE

Arkansas is not alone in passing laws aimed at cutting down on fraud at virtual currency kiosks.

The Arizona Cryptocurrency Kiosk License Fraud Prevention law took effect Sept. 26, according to a news release from Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes.

The law lowers daily transaction minimums, increases warnings on the kiosks, requires transaction receipts and requires Bitcoin ATM operators to issue refunds to victims of fraud, the release states.

“I'm glad we can implement commonsense protections to prevent even more Arizonans from becoming victims of cryptocurrency ATM fraud,” Mayes said. “Last year, Arizonans lost an astounding $177 million in their hard-earned savings to cryptocurrency scammers. This is a good first step, but we need to do even more to protect Arizona seniors from these persistent criminals.”

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed the Digital Asset Kiosk Act into law Aug. 18, according to a news release from the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation.

The act requires virtual currency kiosk operators to register with the Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, provide reports detailing all kiosk locations, and provide full refunds to new customers who are victims of scams at kiosks. Transaction fees are also capped at 18% at the kiosks and daily transaction amounts are capped at $2,500 for new customers.

Iowa's new cryptocurrency law took effect July 1, according to information from the Iowa Attorney General's Office. It requires operators of virtual currency kiosks to issue refunds to Iowans for fraudulent transactions processed through the machines as long as certain steps are followed within 90 days of the transaction. It also implements a $1,000 daily transaction limit and a $10,000 limit for the 30 days following a person's first transaction with the cryptocurrency ATM company, prohibits operators from charging fees over 15% of the value of the cryptocurrency being bought and requires the ATMs to display enhanced scam warnings.

CASE IN STATE COURT

A lawsuit was filed in April against the Benton County Sheriff's Office after deputies seized $14,120 from a virtual currency kiosk when a person claimed to have been scammed.

Bitcoin Depot, the company operating the kiosk, is suing the Sheriff's Office for the thousands of dollars, which was seized from the machine as a result of a search warrant.

The lawsuit claims a user created a Bitcoin Depot account March 10 at Circle K at 3209 S.W. Second St. in Bentonville. The user purchased Bitcoin for $14,120 in two separate transactions, and the Bitcoin was sent to a digital wallet, according to court documents. Cryptocurrency is stored in a digital wallet, which can be online, on a computer or on an external hard drive, according to the Federal Trade Commission.

The lawsuit claims after the kiosk user completed the transactions, he contacted the company's customer service to report he was a scam victim. He reported he'd received a call from someone who claimed to be a deputy from the Benton County Sheriff's Office and there was a warrant out for his arrest for failure to appear for jury duty, according to the complaint.

The individual pretending to be a deputy first instructed the user to pay the money by PayPal, but then instructed the man to use an ATM and provided a QR code, according to the complaint. The code directed the money to a digital wallet not owned by the man, but presumably owned by the scammer, the complaint states.

The customer service representative informed the man both transactions had been completed and all transactions are final and irreversible, according to the complaint. The representative recommended the man contact local law enforcement about the scam, according to court documents.

The man reported to the Sheriff's Office he had been scammed; the Sheriff's Office then obtained a warrant and seized $14,120 from the ATM.

The lawsuit claims the seized money belongs to Bitcoin Depot and the money is not evidence of any crime, including theft of property and criminal impersonation.

The company contacted the Sheriff's Office and Benton County Prosecuting Attorney's Office requesting the money be returned, but the money has not been returned, according to the complaint.

The lawsuit has not been resolved.

The seven Benton County circuit judges recused from the case, and it has been assigned to Jim Spears, a retired circuit judge.

The Arkansas Attorney General's Office issued a news release in April that cryptocurrency kiosk scams are on the rise in Arkansas.

Arkansans who wish to report concerns about potential cryptocurrency kiosk scams should contact the attorney general by calling (800) 482-8982, emailing [email protected] or by visiting arkansasag.gov/file-a-complaint.

--------------------------------------------

How do these scams work, and what are the dangers?

Scammers will call or text consumers claiming to be a legitimate institution, such as a bank or a government institution.

Often, they create a sense of urgency by stating an account has been compromised or a person owes the government back taxes or missed court and owe several thousand dollars. Scammers may even send someone documents that look official or "spoof" a legitimate organization, meaning the caller ID will show an organization's name.

Once the scammer has a person worried, they direct them to deposit money into a cryptocurrency kiosk.

Payments through kiosks are quick and immediate. Transactions cannot be reversed and are often untraceable.

Five things to remember:

No legitimate business will demand advance payment through a Bitcoin ATM.

No government organization will contact someone via text message to pay a bill or ask for payments through a Bitcoin ATM.

People should not pay anyone who contacts them with cryptocurrency, wire transfers or gift cards. If contacted about cryptocurrency, people should hang up and try calling the institution back (such as the sheriff's office, utility company or bank) through a known number.

People should never provide personal information to anyone they do not know. Instead, they should contact a trusted relative or friend and ask for advice.

For those who have been the victim of a cryptocurrency scam, they should contact the Office of the Attorney General and file a complaint.

Blazpay ($BLAZ) has officially launched its presale, with Phase 1 now live at the entry price of just $0.006 per token. This first phase of this presale cryptocurrency offers the lowest price buyers will ever see, as the cost of tokens will automatically increase once the allocated tokens are sold.

With only a limited allocation available at the current level, the presale is already drawing attention as one of the most promising ico pre sales of 2025. The excitement is being driven not just by the low entry point, but also by the possibility that Blazpay could climb to $1, $5, or even $10 in the future.

Supporters are lining up early to secure tokens before the next phase begins and the price rises. The big question remains: can Blazpay really deliver on these ambitious targets?

Behind every major presale success is a strong community, and Blazpay is entering Phase 1 with adoption already in place. Unlike many early stage projects that launch with just a concept, Blazpay has visible traction to build upon.

In addition to these milestones, Blazpay has introduced real utilities that drive user engagement. Its BlazPoints rewards system incentivizes platform activity with gamified on chain benefits, while BlazThreads encourages users to create educational content and share knowledge about DeFi.

These utilities highlight that Blazpay is building more than hype. It is creating an ecosystem designed for growth, education, and participation, which makes its presale feel less speculative and more about scaling what is already working.

The math behind Blazpay's live presale is what has many calling it one of the most explosive opportunities of the year. Starting at just $0.006 per token, the potential upside is enormous:

While no outcome is guaranteed, these projections show why Blazpay is already being described as a standout presale cryptocurrency for 2025. Few projects combine such a low entry with the possibility of scaling into double digits.

Joining the Blazpay presale is simple, and early entry is key to securing the lowest price before tokens rise in Phase 2. Here's the step-by-step process:

Phase 1 has limited availability, and once the allocation is sold or the phase ends, the price will automatically increase.

Most presale projects launch with promises but little more than a roadmap. Buyers are often left waiting for months before they see working products. Blazpay presale is different. It is entering the market as a DeFi platform that unifies trading, staking, bridging, and portfolio management into one secure hub.

Adding to this is BlazAI, the built-in AI execution layer. Instead of navigating complicated menus, participants can type commands like “stake 500 tokens” or “bridge USDT to Ethereum.” BlazAI handles the process instantly across more than 20 supported blockchains, optimizing for speed, cost, and accuracy.

By combining a one-stop ecosystem with AI-powered simplicity, Blazpay is more than another ico presale. It is a project designed to solve real issues in DeFi, making it easier and safer for everyone to participate.

Blazpay is live, and Phase 1 of its presale cryptocurrency is already generating buzz. With a starting price of $0.006, a unified DeFi platform powered by AI, and over a million community members, it is being highlighted as one of the most promising ico presales of the year.

The upside potential is clear. If targets of $1, $5, or $10 are ever reached, early buyers who joined in Phase 1 could see massive returns. But the opportunity to lock in the lowest entry point will not last forever.

With limited tokens available and the next price increase set for just 14 days away, Blazpay's presale is offering a rare early access opportunity in 2025.

Join Phase 1 now at Blazpay.com and secure your tokens before the next price increase.

 Ethereum Foundation sells 1,000 ETH via CoW Swap for stablecoins to support research, grants and DeFi funding as part of its treasury strategy. 

The Ethereum Foundation (EF) announced plans to convert 1,000 Ether (ETH) into stablecoins to finance research, grants and donations, aligning with its broader treasury strategy and involvement in funding decentralized finance (DeFi) initiatives. 

The sale, worth approximately $4.5 million at current prices, was executed via CoW Swap, a decentralized trading protocol that aggregates liquidity across multiple exchanges to offer users competitive prices without relying on a centralized intermediary.

Neither the foundation's announcement nor its treasury policy specified which stablecoins it would receive in exchange for the ETH.

This latest conversion follows EF's earlier disclosure in September that it planned to convert 10,000 ETH into stablecoins over several weeks. However, Friday's transaction appears to be separate from that initiative, given its smaller scale and use of CoW Swap rather than a centralized exchange.

According to the Ethereum Foundation Treasury Policy, EF seeks to “balance between seeking returns above a benchmark rate and extending EF's role as a steward of the Ethereum ecosystem, with a particular focus on DeFi.”

The increased use of stablecoins also comes as EF temporarily paused open grant submissions to its Ecosystem Support Program, citing an influx of applications. The foundation said it will instead prioritize funding for the network's most pressing needs.

In April, EF also announced a leadership restructuring to improve strategic and operational management. The foundation appointed Hsiao-Wei Wang and Tomasz K. Stańczak as co-executive directors, both of whom previously held roles within EF. In June, the foundation laid off staff and restructured its core development team.

Since its launch, Ethereum has remained the leading platform for DeFi applications. Despite growing competition from other blockchain networks, Ethereum still accounts for roughly 68% of total value locked (TVL) across DeFi platforms, according to industry data.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently reiterated the network's focus on decentralized finance, arguing that “low-risk” DeFi applications could help create more sustainable revenue for the ecosystem, similar to how Google Search underpins Google's business model.

“Low-risk DeFi can play a similar role for Ethereum,” Buterin wrote, pointing to “the basic functions of payments and savings, and well-understood tools like synthetic assets and fully collateralized lending.”

America's biggest crypto exchange Coinbase became the latest company in the digital asset space to apply to the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC) for a national trust charter.

The public company announced the move on Friday, following in the footsteps of stablecoin issuers Circle and Paxos, and fintech Ripple.

If approved, Coinbase said it would be able to faster offer products and services, and further innovate "to integrate digital assets into traditional finance," the company said. The license allows companies—that aren't banks—to oversee their own reserves and take custody of assets for institutions.

"Coinbase has no intention of becoming a bank," the exchange said. "It is our firm belief that clear rules and the trust of our regulators and customers enable Coinbase to confidently innovate while ensuring proper oversight and security."

"If approved, the charter would continue to open up opportunities for Coinbase to launch new products beyond custody, including payments and related services, with the confidence of regulatory clarity, fostering broader institutional adoption," the company added.

Coinbase did not immediately respond to Decrypt's questions. 

Crypto platform Anchorage Digital was the first digital assets firm to receive an OCC charter back in 2021. This year, Circle, which issues the USDC stablecoin, and Paxos, which issues tokens PYUSD and PAXG, applied for the license. RLUSD stablecoin issuer Ripple has also applied for a charter.

San Francisco, California-based Coinbase is pushing deeper into the traditional finance world. In July, it signed a deal with JPMorganChase, aiming to allow customers to buy crypto quicker and easier than before.

Coinbase went public in 2021 and has a contract with the U.S. Marshals Service—part of the Department of Justice—to manage and dispose of seized digital assets like Bitcoin. The company also custodies Bitcoin for the crypto ETF products released by top asset managers BlackRock and Fidelity.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

The Ethereum Foundation said Friday it will swap 1,000 ETH (approximately $4.5 million) for stablecoins to fund growth.

Using CoWSwap's TWAP feature, the organization said converting the ether into stablecoins will help it fuel "ongoing work to fund R&D, grants and donations, and to highlight the power of DeFi," according to a post to social media platform X.

Last month, the Ethereum Foundation made a similar announcement, saying it would convert 10,000 ether (worth $43.6 million at the time) to stablecoins on centralized exchanges, framed as routine funding for research, grants, and donations.

The announcement came after the foundation paused, or slowed, several grant programs to reduce its burn rate, The Block previously reported. As with last month's 10,000-ETH announcement, many users on X criticized the foundation's plan on Friday.

Some urged the Ethereum Foundation to either borrow against its ETH using DeFi-native lending platforms or engage in over-the-counter deals with digital asset treasuries.

On Friday, the Ethereum Foundation pointed to its treasury policy from last June, outlining how it prefers to manage its funds.

"To achieve its objectives, EF will maintain and periodically refine an asset-liability management policy and a high-level grant allocation strategy," the blog post said. "EF will manage its assets, considering risk, duration, and liquidity, while remaining aligned with Ethereum's core principles."

Aerospace companies are stepping up their game by harnessing blockchain technology for a whole new level of efficiency. Imagine being able to trace every single part, from raw materials to the final product, on an unchangeable ledger. Sounds too good to be true? Well, it's becoming a reality. In this post, I want to dive into how blockchain is enhancing traceability, fighting counterfeit risks, and optimizing logistics. Plus, we'll look at the promise of crypto payments in aerospace, and the regulatory hurdles that lie ahead. This is a big deal, folks.

Let's talk about traceability. With blockchain, aerospace companies can track every transaction and process related to components, including the all-important material testing results and quality assurance data. This creates a tamper-proof "digital birth certificate" for each part, ensuring authenticity and compliance with regulatory requirements. The risk of counterfeiting? Significantly reduced.

But it doesn't end there. The use of blockchain payments can also speed up the procurement processes for materials, allowing for quicker transactions and better cash flow management. This is especially crucial in an industry where high-value components require meticulous tracking.

The aerospace supply chain is a tangled web, involving numerous players from suppliers to manufacturers. Blockchain can enhance supply chain visibility, offering a decentralized ledger to all parties involved. This increased transparency can minimize inconsistencies, improve coordination, and allow real-time tracking of parts.

Crypto payments can also make logistics smoother. Allowing direct transactions between suppliers and manufacturers can cut down on the administrative mess and errors that come with traditional payment methods. With the rise of B2B crypto payment platforms tailored for aerospace, operational efficiency could see a significant boost.

The potential for cryptocurrency payments in aerospace testing and services is becoming increasingly clear. The recent move by Emirates to accept crypto payments for flights is a sign that the aerospace sector won't be far behind. This could streamline the purchasing process for aircraft spare parts and maintenance services, improving both operational efficiency and data handling.

Integrating EOR with crypto payments can also simplify payroll and contractor payments in aerospace. This not only makes transactions easier but also aligns with the industry's need for compliance.

Of course, it's not all smooth sailing. The aerospace sector is highly regulated, with strict safety, maintenance, and operational standards. It's a minefield when it comes to compliance, especially with financial regulations like AML and KYC.

And don't forget about data privacy and security. The unchangeable nature of blockchain can clash with regulations like GDPR, so companies will need to find a way to balance transparency with the need to protect sensitive information.

For aerospace companies looking to integrate cryptocurrency, best practices for crypto treasury management are essential. This means having a solid strategy for managing crypto assets, ensuring compliance, and putting risk management protocols in place to handle volatility.

Using a crypto treasury API can also help automate compliance checks and optimize financial operations. By doing this, aerospace companies can keep pace with innovation in the industry.

The future of aerospace is on the brink of transformation with blockchain and cryptocurrency. Enhanced material testing, better supply chain management, and seamless payments could lead to greater efficiency and reduced costs. As companies navigate the regulatory maze, the potential of blockchain and crypto to change the game is clear. Embracing these technologies could be the key to staying ahead in an increasingly digital world.

Fall may finally be here, but any impending Crypto Winter still seems far away. On Friday, Bitcoin continued its five-day rally to near $124,000, mere hundreds of dollars from an all-time high that the leading cryptocurrency notched in mid-August. And for longtime crypto watchers, the start of October is living up to its “Uptober” nickname.

Despite volatility in stock prices spurred by the U.S. government shutdown, the price of Bitcoin has been steadily climbing since last Sunday, with investors egged on by a Thursday report from JPMorgan analysts who predicted it could reach $165,000 by the end of the year, citing Bitcoin's utility as a hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies.





Crypto advocates have long argued that Bitcoin could serve as a safe haven amid government uncertainty because of its decentralized architecture, though the cryptocurrency has often traded in lockstep with traditional equity markets. But in recent months, investors have poured into Bitcoin amid threats of tariffs. The JPMorgan analysts argued that Bitcoin remains undervalued compared with another favorite hedge among investors: gold.





Other cryptocurrencies have also soared in recent days, with Ethereum climbing nearly 9% over the past week to $4,500.  





Not everyone agreed with JPMorgan's rosy prognostication. Alex Blume, founder and CEO of investment advisor Two Prime, described Bitcoin's recent gains as a “precarious rally” in commentary shared with Fortune, arguing that it might be caused by investors expecting a fourth-quarter rally. Still, Blume pointed out that even stock prices are trending upward, meaning that the market is reacting to broader monetary policy, including the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates. “There's pretty much no other way to foresee the future other than more money printing, a net benefit for BTC,” he wrote.




Crypto's climb comes as U.S. regulatory agencies continue to loosen restrictions on investor access to digital assets. Recent decisions by the Securities and Exchange Commission have allowed new exchange-traded funds centered around cryptocurrencies such as XRP and Solana, and have created an opening for different financial firms to custody digital assets on behalf of their clients.





A lone dissenter at the SEC, commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, argued in a statement earlier this week that the new interpretation could open investors up to risks, from theft to misappropriation of their assets. “I fear investors' assets may fall through the cracks,” she wrote.

Oops, something went wrong

Coinbase's newest lending product is generating profits for the crypto exchange in several ways, but not all are reflected clearly on-chain.

As the firm lets customers deposit wrapped Bitcoin and Circle's USDC into “vaults” on decentralized finance protocol Morpho, it's earning cash from stablecoin reserves and transaction fees indirectly. It's also taking a cut of performance fees that are designed to incentivize risk managers on the platform, Coinbase has confirmed to Decrypt.

DeFi offers the promise of a more transparent financial system, but it's unclear whether the arrangement poses conflicts of interest or could potentially put user funds at greater risk. Coinbase says that the initiative is addressing investors' growing appetite for ways to use digital assets, unlocking financial empowerment.

In a statement to Decrypt, a Coinbase spokesperson said that the company “is committed to the sustainable success of its products.”

“We firmly maintain this philosophy when searching for collaborators that can help us bring simple, secure on-chain financial products to our users.”

The specifics of Coinbase's arrangement with a so-called curator on Morpho named Steakhouse, through which users are effectively paying the exchange, are not referenced in an FAQ for its product. The FAQ does say that “there are no Coinbase fees,” and interest rates are set by “open lending markets.”

Vaults on Morpho allow Coinbase users to do two things: They can post Bitcoin as collateral for loans, or they can deposit USDC to earn yield. In essence, it resembles a circular market, which crossed $1 billion in originations on Tuesday.

As users make payments toward loans, a percentage of the yield that vaults generate is directed to “curators,” who serve as chief risk officers and strategists, according to Morpho's documentation. It's called a performance fee, and it's customizable vault-to-vault.

The vault with the most deposits on Morpho is curated by a DeFi project called Spark. It is providing liquidity for Bitcoin-backed loans on Morpho, while taking a 10% slice of the 6% APY (annual percentage yield) that around $700 million in USDC deposits is currently generating.

Steakhouse, meanwhile, is curating a vault that currently lets Coinbase users earn 5.6% APY on USDC. Most of those funds are going toward providing liquidity for Bitcoin-backed loans as well, but the vault collects a 25% performance fee, among the highest on Morpho.

Steakhouse and Coinbase “share” the fee, the Coinbase spokesperson confirmed to Decrypt.

“Steakhouse USDC was selected as a starting vault on account of its collateral exposure being generally very liquid crypto assets which—along with the overcollateralization of the loan positions—creates an additional buffer for lenders,” they added, while highlighting an overview of Steakhouse's risk management framework.

Decrypt has reached out to Steakhouse for comment.

As firms across the U.S. are integrating DeFi into their businesses, some onlookers are comparing the trend to mullets—centralized in the front, yet permissionless in the back. Morpho itself made the comparison on X on Thursday.

From Coinbase's perspective, it's acting as a "technology provider," enabling users to access decentralized protocols like Morpho, Max Branzburg, head of consumer products at Coinbase, told Decrypt. 

“Coinbase is not lending to users. Coinbase is not facilitating the financing itself,” Branzburg said. “This is really about connecting users as a technology platform with DeFi.”

Branzburg compared the initiative to Coinbase's recent support of trading on decentralized exchanges, allowing users to natively access more than 40,000 assets through its mobile app, beyond the 330 currently listed on its platform.

With borrowed funds, Branzburg said that Coinbase is seeing people fund large purchases like cars or home renovations, without needing to sell their Bitcoin, “empowering people to help grow their wealth in ways that they couldn't otherwise.”

The product is far different from a centralized lending service that Coinbase previously offered, which required a patchwork of state licenses. (Coinbase stopped issuing Bitcoin-backed loans in 2023 amid industry-wide, regulatory scrutiny.)

“If we're trying to lend off our balance sheet, for example, or build some centralized financing product, it just has inherent limitations,” he said. “A technology platform to connect people with decentralized protocols can scale infinitely.”

Crypto firms servicing users as technology providers is commonplace. Companies that offer self-custodial wallets, for example, fit the description. They are not considered intermediaries in the U.S. because users are solely responsible for controlling and securing their assets.

Although Coinbase's newest lending product has been tapped by more than 14,200 wallets since its introduction in January, that still equates to less than 1% of the firm's users, Branzburg said. The average loan size that users are taking out is around $50,000, he added.

User activity is taking place on Base, Coinbase's Ethereum layer-2 network, so the exchange is earning fees indirectly through the network's centralized sequencer, which orders transactions before they are passed on to the underlying network.

Coinbase's newest lending product uses cbBTC, a version of wrapped Bitcoin offered by the exchange, and Circle's USDC, which earns Coinbase income. Earlier this year, Circle's public debut revealed that Coinbase earns 50% of the “residual payment base” generated by USDC's backing.

Last month, Branzburg said that USDC lending rates for Coinbase users were temporarily “boosted” by Morpho. That means Morpho's platform doesn't entirely reflect what Coinbase users are receiving either.

In 2022, former SEC Chair and crypto skeptic Gary Gensler cautioned investors that some yields in the cryptosphere appeared “too good to be true.” He also said the public benefits from “full and fair disclosure.”

This year, crypto lending is rallying in the U.S. against a more supportive regulatory backdrop. Coinbase plans to raise loan limits for users to $5 million from $1 million, potentially unlocking what Branzburg described as billions in assets.

“We're always thinking about the regulatory environment that we're building in,” he said. “It's been great to see an environment that is leaning into crypto and believes in the power of Bitcoin, DeFi, and self-custody.”

Monitoring the financial services industry to help companies navigate through regulatory compliance, enforcement, and litigation issues

On September 29, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) announced significant modifications to the proposed regulations under the Digital Financial Assets Law (DFAL) and the Money Transmission Act (MTA). These changes are part of an ongoing effort to refine the regulatory framework governing digital financial assets and ensure clarity in the application of these laws.

Initially proposed on April 4, 2025, the regulations aimed to establish clear licensure requirements under the DFAL and delineate exemptions from the MTA for certain digital asset activities. The proposal underwent a public comment period, concluding on May 19, 2025, during which the DFPI received valuable feedback from various stakeholders.

Key Modifications

Renumbering and Reorganization:The proposed regulations have been renumbered and reorganized to avoid duplication and enhance clarity. The DFAL regulations have been moved from Subchapter 16 to Subchapter 5 of Title 10, with sections renumbered accordingly.

Exemptions under the MTA:The modifications clarify exemptions for digital financial asset transactions from the MTA. Specifically, activities now regulated under the DFAL, such as transmission and storage of digital assets, are exempt from the MTA to prevent redundant regulation. New sections, such as § 80.126.40, define “Monetary Value” to exclude digital financial assets, while § 80.159.10 defines “Digital Financial Asset” as per Financial Code § 3102.

Technical Amendments:Several technical amendments were made to improve clarity and alignment with statutory language. For example, the definition of “control” in § 1200 was refined to align with Financial Code § 3309, emphasizing that the presumption of control is rebuttable.

Token Listing Certification:Section 1250 introduces a certification requirement for covered exchanges listing digital financial assets, ensuring compliance with disclosure and risk assessment protocols.

The DFPI has opened a new comment period for these modifications, running from September 29, 2025 to October 15, 2025.

Conclusion

These regulatory updates reflect California's commitment to fostering a clear and effective regulatory environment for digital financial assets. By refining these regulations, the DFPI aims to balance consumer protection with the facilitation of innovation in the financial sector. Stakeholders should review the proposed changes and participate in the comment process to ensure their perspectives are included in the final regulatory framework.

A federal judge in California has tossed out a class-action lawsuit against Yuga Labs, creator of the once-dominant Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection, ruling that the digital collectibles cannot be considered securities.  

The Los Angeles-based judge, Fernando M. Olguin—who was appointed to the bench in 2013 by former president Barack Obama—ruled Thursday that Bored Ape NFTs fail to meet several criteria of the test used to determine the security status of financial transactions.

Olguin ruled Bored Ape NFTs should be considered different from other NFT collections previously found to have plausibly constituted securities—particularly Dapper Labs' NBA Top Shot NFTs and DraftKings NFTs—-given plaintiffs purchased Bored Apes on third-party marketplaces like OpenSea and Coinbase, and not on a marketplace controlled by the NFT issuer.

Bored Ape NFTs fail to trigger the necessary “common enterprise” prong of the test used by courts to determine whether an asset is a security, Olguin determined.

“In sum, plaintiffs have not alleged the type of ‘interplay' between the alleged securities and proprietary ‘ecosystem' that underpinned the logic of Dapper Labs and DraftKings, and therefore have not adequately alleged horizontal commonality,” he wrote. 

The judge further found that Yuga Labs' collection of a creator royalty fee on every Bored Ape sale suggests “a de-coupling of [plaintiffs'] fortunes from those of defendants, who stood to gain even if plaintiffs sold their own NFTs at a loss.” NFT issuers rely on creator royalties as a form of revenue, collecting a baked-in fee—sometimes upwards of 10%—each time the collectible token is bought and sold.

The court's logic contrasts sharply with legal arguments made by the SEC during the Biden administration—particularly that creator royalties indicated an asset was a security, one encouraged by its creators to be resold. 

For years, Yuga Labs has been at the front lines of a legal standoff with the federal government over the security status of NFTs, given the company's prominence in the sector. Once red hot status symbols that have since faded in value and cultural relevance, Bored Ape NFTs have nonetheless seen a seismic $7.2 billion worth of trading volume since launching in 2021. 

Earlier this year, Yuga Labs announced the SEC had closed its yearslong investigation into the company, as a part of the Trump administration's aggressive pro-crypto realignment. The SEC also closed a similar investigation into NFT marketplace OpenSea.

It's one thing for the SEC to decline to pursue certain cases against NFT projects though, and another for a federal court to definitively rule on the matter, as it did in Yuga's case this week. 

Despite the significance of the ruling, Bored Ape NFTs seem largely unaffected. The collection's floor price—the price of the cheapest available NFT in a collection—is down 2% in the last 24 hours, to $37,337 at writing. That's a decline of 90% from the project's all-time high of $369,900, reached in April 2022. 

Representatives for Yuga did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment on this story.

Earlier this week Swift announced that it is partnering with Consensys to launch a conceptual prototype for a blockchain to form part of its infrastructure. While Consensys's CEO Joe Lubin was reported as saying the ledger is the Linea Layer 2 blockchain, it's more likely to be a clone of Linea as Swift's Chief Innovation Officer Tom Zschach said the ledger did not yet exist. 

The banking community has been strongly supportive of Swift's initiative with 30 banks involved, but Fireblocks CEO Michael Shaulov was dismissive. Fireblocks is building its own payments network which targets both fintechs and traditional financial institutions. It has secured more than $10 trillion in digital asset transactions and counts BNY, Revolut and Worldpay as clients. In a LinkedIn post, Shaulov pointed to Swift conducting blockchain experiments since 2018 and that banks have lagged fintechs, despite a rapid acceleration this year. He added that Swift's specifications are not appropriate for new market structures.

He stepped up the criticism by saying, “You can technically browse the internet using a fax machine – but I haven't seen anyone doing it.”

Bitcoin rallied on Friday to within striking distance of its record high as the U.S. government's shutdown entered its third day.

The world's oldest cryptocurrency is trading up roughly 2% on the day at $123,874. That's about 1% below its all-time high price of just north of $124,000 that it reached in mid-August.

Investors are flocking to the decentralized asset after U.S. lawmakers failed to strike a deal on federal funding, forcing the U.S. government to shutdown on Wednesday. Bitcoin is up 12% this week alone.

"The shutdown matters this time around," wrote Standard Chartered's Geoff Kendrick. "During the previous Trump shutdown (22 Dec 2018 to 25 Jan 2019) Bitcoin was in a different place than now, so it did little." 

"However, this year bitcoin has traded with 'US government risks' as best shown by its relationship to US treasury term premium," added Kendrick.

Standard Chartered expects a new high soon and ultimately the crypto hitting $135,000 after that.

Traders are turning to crypto and other assets to hedge against mounting political and economic tensions. Spot gold rose 0.5% to $3,876.55 per ounce on early Friday, with prices gaining more than 2% this week.

Traders also poured some money into stocks on Friday, despite the increasing geopolitical uncertainties. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also rose .5% and .27% on the day, respectively.

VanEck has taken an early step toward launching a staked Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) by registering a statutory trust for the product in Delaware, a public filing dated October 2 shows.

The proposed product, named the VanEck Lido Staked Ethereum ETF, would give investors exposure to ether ETH$4,521.71 that is staked through Lido, a decentralized protocol that lets users earn staking rewards without locking up assets themselves. 

Registering the trust is a procedural first move and does not yet represent a formal ETF application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Lido dominadtes Ethereum staking, with about $38 billion worth of ETH — roughly one-third of all staked ether — currently locked in the protocol. It's a key player in Ethereum's proof-of-stake system, allowing users to earn yield on their tokens while keeping them liquid via derivative tokens called stETH.

In traditional finance terms, the ETF would operate like a fund that holds interest-bearing assets, but instead of bonds or cash, it would hold staked ETH. That structure would open up staked crypto to institutional investors who prefer the ETF wrapper, while removing the technical barrier of staking directly.

Lido's governance token, LDO, is up more than 3% over the past 24 hours.

If approved, VanEck's product could be the first staked ETH ETF in the U.S., adding a new layer to the growing competition among issuers racing to launch crypto-based funds.

Samsung is partnering with Coinbase to let 75 million U.S. Galaxy users access Bitcoin and crypto with Coinbase One's premium features directly through Samsung Wallet, no extra apps required. 

Samsung has partnered with Coinbase to give 75 million of its Galaxy device owners in the U.S. access to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

The union brings Coinbase One's premium features — including zero trading fees and boosted staking rewards — directly into Samsung Wallet, allowing users to explore Bitcoin and crypto without downloading any additional apps or moving funds across different platforms, Coinbase said. 

The integration will also connect Samsung Pay to Coinbase accounts, allowing Galaxy users to make purchases with Bitcoin and other crypto holdings in the same place they already store payment cards, transit passes, and IDs. 

For the millions of everyday Americans who own Galaxy devices, this is a major step toward mainstream crypto adoption.

For now, the pairing will start in the United States, but could soon expand globally. 

“We're pairing their global scale with Coinbase's trusted platform to deliver the best value for people to access crypto — starting with more than 75 million Galaxy users in the U.S., and soon expanding globally,” said Shan Aggarwal, Chief Business Officer at Coinbase.

The move highlights a growing trend in mobile finance: bringing Bitcoin and other digital assets directly to users' fingertips. 

By embedding Bitcoin trading, staking, and payments into a device most Americans already carry, Samsung and Coinbase are removing barriers that have historically kept retail, every-day users from entering the crypto ecosystem.

For example, earlier today, OnePay, the fintech venture majority-owned by Walmart, said it will soon allow its customers to buy, sell and hold bitcoin directly in its mobile app. This access will also help bring bitcoin access to mainstream U.S. retail consumers.

It seems like Wall Street is taking crypto more-and-more seriously, and Coinbase is benefiting from the bitcoin adoption trend. 

Rothschild & Co Redburn upgraded Coinbase (Nasdaq: COIN) from Neutral to Buy today, raising its stock price target to $417, citing the company's diversification beyond retail trading fees. 

Transaction fees now make up ~50% of revenue, while institutional adoption, crypto derivatives via Deribit, USDC distribution, and custodial services provide additional growth. 

Coinbase serves over 200 financial firms and is less reliant on transaction volume than before. Shares have gained 50% this year and closely track Bitcoin.

Samsung and Coinbase partner to give 75 million Galaxy users U.S. access to crypto trading, staking, and seamless payments.

Samsung is partnering with Coinbase to offer 75 million Galaxy device owners in the U.S. access to the exchange's priority trading service. The collaboration is the largest single distribution of coins that Coinbase has ever run and Samsung Galaxy's largest crypto initiative to date. The integration enables users to manage their digital assets directly from their devices without having to download any separate apps or move the funds between platforms.

Through the Samsung Wallet, users of Galaxy will have access to Coinbase One, which offers zero trading fees and enhanced staking rewards. Brian Armstrong, Coinbase CEO, said the partnership is there to make crypto more accessible to everyday users. He went on to say that there are more than 75 million Galaxy owners in the U.S. This will gain free access to Coinbase One with full Samsung Pay integration for buying and managing cryptocurrencies.

This integration also includes features such as the CB1 card, which enables seamstress crypto spending & rewards. Users are able to pay for purchases, earn staking rewards and explore digital assets without going out of the Samsung Wallet environment. Coinbase's integration with Samsung Pay is now live for US users. It allows Galaxy owners several means of interacting with cryptocurrency without sacrificing the convenience of the existing tools that people already use in their financial lives.

Executives from both companies pointed to the strategic importance of the collaboration. Shan Aggarwal, Chief Business Officer at Coinbase, said that the partnership is leveraging Samsung's global reach and Coinbase's trusted platform to deliver value to users.

Drew Blackard, Senior Vice President of Mobile Product Management at Samsung Electronics America, noted that Samsung Wallet is already trusted by millions and the addition of Coinbase's services creates more functionality and engagement for its users. The integration is representative of a growing trend among technology companies to add crypto services to existing consumer ecosystems, and make digital assets more accessible to mainstream audiences.

According to industry observers, such partnerships could lead to wider adoption of digital assets through reduced entry barriers to the sector. By providing cryptocurrency services on widely used mobile devices directly on the device, there is less friction for the user and more efficient portfolio management, payments, and staking can be done. It also illustrates a convergence of the traditional technology and finance fields leading to new channels for using and integrating digital assets.

Coinbase and Samsung will expand access to Galaxy devices worldwide. Additionally, the platform will reach users outside the U.S. This initiative supports the broader trend of integrating digital assets into everyday financial tools. As a result, users will gain more flexibility in managing their treasury.

 The companies, by embedding crypto trading, staking, and payments into a widely adopted mobile ecosystem, are building the foundation for mainstream digital asset adoption, greater financial literacy, and more engagement in the market. This initiative also establishes a precedent for other consumer electronics companies to look at integrating crypto technology which can affect how companies manage their treasury values, which can impact the future of payment processes worldwide.

The European Central Bank (ECB) has announced the companies selected through a procurement process – launched almost two years ago – to provide ‘components and related services' for the prospective digital euro.

In an announcement that will get champagne corks popping at the chosen companies, the Frankfurt-headquartered authority said that ‘as part of the preparation phase' for the potential eurozone central bank digital currency (CBDC) the ‘first-ranked' providers had been selected for ‘framework agreements' in five fields of activity. The agreements, which effectively set the terms for potential future work, have a total estimated spend of €432.1m (about £377m) and a potential maximum spend of €1.164 billion (just over £1 billion).

The areas of activity and companies are: for ‘alias lookup' – Sapient GmbH & Tremend Software Consulting S.R.L.; for ‘risk and fraud management' – Feedzai; for ‘app and software development kit (SDK)' – Almaviva and Fabrick; for ‘offline solution' (the biggest chunk of work in respect of ECB spend) – Giesecke+Devrient (G+D); and for ‘secure exchange of payment information' – Senacor FCS.

The announcement comes as a ‘two-year digital euro preparation phase' focused on practical implementation and technical details wraps up this month (October). A decision on whether to actually issue a digital euro – a central bank digital currency (CBDC) for the 20-member eurozone – is contingent on the adoption of a legal framework.

RELATED ARTICLE ECB kicks off 2024 with hunt for digital euro ‘components and related services' providers – a news story (4 January 2024) on the launch of the process

The alias lookup work would facilitate payment transactions by users and intermediaries using simple aliases instead of long account numbers. The relevant framework's estimated value (excluding VAT) is €27.9 million and maximum value is €55.8 million.

The fraud and risk management work would provide additional support for intermediaries (for example, commercial banks) in identifying fraudulent transactions. Its estimated value (excluding VAT) is €79.1 million and maximum value is €237.3 million.

The app and software development kit (SDK) component consists of a digital euro app and SDK to support intermediaries in the provision of digital euro services through their own apps and online interfaces. Its estimated value (excluding VAT) is €76.8 million and maximum value is €153.6 million.

The offline services component includes engineering and development services to provide an offline bearer payment instrument (a payment device that functions without an internet connection). The offline solution element carries the biggest projected spend (of the five areas) by some distance, with an estimated value (excluding VAT) of €220.7 million and maximum value of €662.1 million.

The secure exchange of payment information component supports the conversion of transactional information (for example, the amount of a transaction) and/or sensitive information (for example, the payment instrument used) into a secure form at the request of an intermediary. Its estimated value (excluding VAT) is €27.6 million and maximum value is €55.2 million.

In its relatively short announcement (‘ECB selects digital euro service providers' – 2 October), the ECB also names a ‘second-ranked' provider in four of the five areas, stating that these companies ‘will be approached only if required'. These companies are: equensWorldline (for alias lookup and also secure exchange of payment information); Capgemini Deutschland (for risk and fraud management) and Sapient GmbH & Tremend Software Consulting S.R.L (for app and SDK). The second-ranked offline services provider is to be announced ‘in due course.'

An ECB announcement on the start of the procurement process in January 2024 explained that the Frankfurt-headquartered authority was looking to establish framework agreements ‘with the most suitable external providers to ensure that the Eurosystem is prepared to start developing a digital euro in the future if warranted.' It also said that all frameworks were estimated to start in January 2025.

This week's announcement similarly makes clear that the ‘actual development of the components – or parts thereof – will be decided at a later stage, subject to the ECB Governing Council's decision on the potential next phase of the project.'

It also makes clear that framework agreements do not involve payments (to suppliers) ‘at this stage and include safeguards allowing for the scope to be adjusted in line with changes to the legislation.'

All frameworks will run for a minimum four years, with a maximum contract duration of 10 years – or, in two cases, 15 years.The digital euro preparation phase (previously referred to as a ‘realisation phase') follows a digital euro ‘investigation phase' launched by the Eurosystem, which comprises the ECB and the national central banks of the 20 EU member states whose currency is the euro, in October 2021.

RELATED ARTICLE ECB announces 70 private-sector partners for digital euro ‘innovation platform' – a news story (7 May 2025) on an ‘innovation platform' (including a list of all participants) – see below

Numerous external parties have already been engaged by the ECB on digital euro-related assignments – albeit with significantly lower spend.

For example, the ECB awarded framework contracts with five companies for digital euro consultancy (Accenture, BearingPoint, Deloitte Consulting, Oliver Wyman and Roland Berger) in November 2022.The consultancies' framework agreements (which did not entail a definite financial commitment by the ECB towards any specific contractor) are running for four years, with a maximum of two annual extensions. The maximum spend is €20m across all contracts (so, €4m per consultancy if work were to end up being evenly diced).

These appointments followed the ECB's selection of a different five companies (from 54 applications) to prototype digital euro user interfaces in September 2022: CaixaBank, which concentrated on peer-to-peer online payments; Worldline, which focused on peer-to-peer offline payments; the EPI (European Payments Initiative) company, which examined point-of-sale payments initiated by the payer; Nexi, which explored point-of-sale payments initiated by the payee; and Amazon, which focused on e-commerce payments. These five companies were not remunerated for their efforts and the ECB said there were no plans to re-use the prototypes in subsequent project phases.

Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) queried the selection of Amazon, expressing concerns including the company's US roots and market dominance. In an appearance before a parliamentary committee in September 2022 then-ECB executive board member Fabio Panetta (now Banca d'Italia governor) mounted a sustained defence of the process and purpose of appointing the company, saying that the ECB was solely focused on learning about technological solutions and was not “making any deal on future co-operation.”

More recently, the ECB announced in May that it had been working with about 70 market participants through an ‘innovation platform' to explore possible digital euro applications. In the past week it published a 41-page report (‘Digital euro innovation platform – Outcome report: pioneers and visionaries workstreams' – 26 September) and announced a second round of experimentation.

Global Government Fintech‘s Digital Currencies topic section

The companies appointed to the newly announced five assignments have published their own announcements.

Munich-headquartered G+D highlighted that its appointment to deliver the offline solution was alongside partner companies Nexi and Capgemini.

‘The ability to pay offline, with no third-party involvement, is a key feature of the digital euro, which would ensure privacy and resilience as only cash does today,' the company said in a press release.

‘Following the framework agreement conclusion, G+D and other successful tenderers will work with the ECB to finalise planning and timelines,' its announcement continued. ‘Under the guidance of the ECB Governing Council and in line with EU legislation, this work will cover the design, integration and development of the Digital Euro Service Platform (DESP).'

Feedzai, a Portuguese-based company, similarly makes reference to another company, stating in an announcement that it would deliver – in partnership with subcontractor PwC – ‘a state-of-the-art central fraud detection and prevention mechanism, ensuring full compliance with EU security, privacy and data protection standards.'

The company describes its role as being ‘to contribute to safeguarding transactions from fraud by enriching payment service providers' (PSPs) own risk management with insights derived from a central infrastructure-level view.' It explains that ‘for every transaction, whether peer-to-peer (P2P) or peer-to-merchant (P2M), our platform will provide a fraud risk score that PSPs will use alongside their own controls when deciding whether to approve or decline a payment.'

Almaviva and Fabrick are both Italian companies.

‘The app, designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, will be accessible via smartphone, tablet or smartwatch, offering all European Union [EU] citizens a uniform and secure experience for digital payments,' Almaviva said. ‘The part of the project entrusted to the two Italian companies also includes the development of an infrastructure that will be open and interoperable thanks to dedicated SDKs [software development kits] and APIs [application programming interfaces – APIs], enabling European payment service providers [PSPs] to smoothly integrate their services with the digital euro platform.'

‘This approach will ensure widespread adoption of the new currency and foster innovation throughout the payments ecosystem, strengthening Europe's technological autonomy,' Almaviva added.

Senacor, a German company, highlighted its contract award in a LinkedIn post, describing ‘secure exchange of payment information' (SEPI) as ‘the central token service of the digital euro service platform' and explaining that this component ‘replaces sensitive payment information with secure tokens, so that the data does not need to be transmitted directly'.‘A specialised expert team from Senacor, together with European cloud service providers, will drive the development of an advanced solution for SEPI,' the company said.

With the government backing calls for the regulation of certain cryptocurrencies, are stablecoins the future?

The Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, has softened his sceptical views on the future of stablecoins in the UK, saying it would be wrong to dismiss the cryptocurrency “as a matter of principle”. Writing in the Financial Times, Bailey recognised their potential for “innovation in payments systems” but warned that the new technology “must still answer old central banking questions” to maintain public trust in money, which is “critical” to all economies.

Stablecoin is a form of cryptocurrency, the digital currencies operated by private companies or individuals rather than central banks like the Bank of England (BoE) or the European Central Bank. Crypto, which is currently unregulated in the UK, has seen a major rise in recent years, based on risky “speculative trading”, according to the Financial Conduct Authority.

The most popular and well-known stablecoin is Tether (USDT), with other leading stablecoins including USD Coin (USDC-USD) and Stasis Euro (EURS-USD).

Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are completely detached from centralised financial institutions, stablecoins are “pegged” to tangible assets, like US dollars, the British pound, or gold prices.

They are designed to hold a steady value, only rarely dipping above or below a designated ratio. For example, a stablecoin with perfect efficiency to the US dollar, would consistently value one “coin” as one dollar. Some stablecoins have a reserve controlled by an algorithm to generate more coins or remove coins according to supply and demand.

The market for this category of cryptocurrency is already valued at $200 billion (£148 billion) globally. With London responsible for 40% of foreign exchange turnover, the prospect of formal UK participation in stablecoins is an attractive one, according to a report by Innovate Finance.

The attraction of stablecoin is considerable. It bypasses traditional currency conversions, and facilitates “more predictable” and “lower-cost” payments internationally, said Yahoo Finance.

The government is intent on driving forward “developments in blockchain technology”, including stablecoins, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said in her Mansion House speech in July.

The BoE aims to publish a consultation paper, setting out a blueprint for the “UK's systemic stablecoin regime”, to ensure the UK will “reap the benefits” of the new currency, said Bailey in the FT. The BoE had previously proposed that stablecoin holdings would be capped at as little as £20,000, with no interest offered to customers.

The European Union, Hong Kong, Japan (since 2023) and the United States have all implemented rules to make trading more transparent, a step which has been broadly welcomed by the crypto community.

Stablecoins can still be risky, even when pegged to tangible assets. If a stablecoin strays too far from its target value and this cannot be corrected, it can be “depegged”.

On a larger scale, if stablecoins were left unregulated, central banks could be caught on a tightrope. If a stablecoin crashes, the fallout could trigger “fire sales” – rapid sales at significantly low prices due to financial distress – to establish an equilibrium, said Bloomberg.

Conversely, if stablecoins “prove their worth”, allowing users to exchange and store vast sums of money, the “monetary monopoly” of the banks would be undermined.

And as with other cryptocurrencies, an unregulated system can be exploited for illegal activity. Trading is “anonymous, fast and cheap”, making stablecoins highly attractive for criminals to use to conduct scams or launder funds.

The agreement follows the conclusion of the ECB's negotiated procurement procedures for five key components of the planned central bank digital currency.

The European Central Bank (ECB) has signed a framework agreement with security technology firm Giesecke+Devrient (G+D) and its partners Nexi and Capgemini to deliver offline payment capabilities for the digital euro.

The trio, led by Munich-based security firm G+D, ranked first among tenderers for the contract to design, implement and partially operate the system that will allow users to make digital euro payments without internet or power connections.

Offline functionality has been positioned as a defining feature of the digital euro. From the outset, the ECB has emphasized that a central bank digital currency must provide privacy and resilience comparable to cash. 



Payments under the offline model are stored directly on user devices such as smartphones, cards or other compatible tools, and are settled locally between devices without passing through banks, payment providers, or the central bank itself.

According to the ECB, this structure ensures transactions remain private and reliable, extending the reach of the euro in digital form while preserving the characteristics of physical cash. 

The digital euro is also intended as a complement to banknotes and coins, available to anyone across the euro area and functioning as a universal means of payment.

“We are proud to lead this pan-European cooperation, working together with our partners Nexi and Capgemini to bring the digital euro's offline capabilities to life,” said Dr. Wolfram Seidemann, CEO of G+D Currency Technology. “This milestone underscores our commitment to innovation and security in digital payment solutions while preserving the privacy and resilience that citizens expect from cash.”

Under the new agreement, G+D and its partners will work with the ECB to finalize the design, integration and development of the Digital Euro Service Platform (DESP). The Governing Council of the ECB will oversee the process in line with European legislation, ensuring the solution is consistent with current monetary and financial policy goals.

G+D brings longstanding expertise in currency technology and security systems to the project. Its partners, Nexi and Capgemini, will contribute specialized knowledge in payment infrastructure and technology integration. 

Nexi, a major European payments company, is tasked with ensuring that the digital euro integrates seamlessly with existing point-of-sale systems. 

Capgemini on the other hand will support development and testing of the offline interfaces, drawing on its background in technology consulting and digital transformation.

The digital euro project remains in its preparation phase. The ECB will spearhead the evaluation of technical solutions, legal frameworks and user experience considerations before any decision on issuance is made.

Current Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems exhibit several critical drawbacks, including significant vulnerabilities in security, privacy, and scalability. Traditional centralized databases are highly susceptible to cyber attacks, data breaches, and unauthorized access, posing severe risks to the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive patient information. In addition, these systems often face interoperability issues, which hinder seamless information sharing and access among healthcare providers. The absence of a unified and secure framework exacerbates these problems, leading to operational inefficiencies and increased administrative costs in the management of health records. This study introduces an innovative framework designed to overcome these challenges by integrating blockchain technology with the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). The proposed EHRChain solution leverages attribute-based encryption to provide fine-grained access control, ensuring that only authorized users can retrieve and decrypt medical records. The IPFS framework eliminates single points of failure by storing encrypted data in a decentralized fashion, thus increasing the resilience of the system to cyber attacks. Incorporating blockchain technology ensures the immutability and traceability of medical data, significantly reducing the risks of data tampering. Performance evaluations using real data set simulation demonstrate the efficiency and feasibility of our framework, highlighting its potential to revolutionize the handling of electronic medical records. This study not only underscores the advantages of integrating blockchain with EHR systems but also presents a scalable and secure solution tailored to meet the demands of modern healthcare infrastructures. Our approach promises to improve data security, improve interoperability, and reduce operational inefficiencies, leading to a new standard in electronic health records.

With the emergence of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)1, the volume of medical data generated daily has increased dramatically. As the healthcare sector transitions from traditional paper-based charts to Electronic Health Record (EHR), various solutions have been implemented to manage these records efficiently, aiming to enhance patient safety by preventing errors and increasing information accessibility. EHR2, not only serve as legal evidence and tools for predicting and preventing infectious diseases but also enable physicians to reflect on and share treatment experiences with patients in real-time. By 20253, it is projected that electronic storage will encompass at least 15% of patient medical records, marking a 110% increase from 2018 levels.

Typically, medical institutions rely on third-party servers, like cloud servers, to manage encrypted data, which helps reduce computational costs and save space while facilitating efficient data retrieval4. However, the sharing of electronic medical data among medical facilities, though beneficial for providing immediate feedback on patient responses to treatment, raises serious privacy concerns. Once shared, this data is susceptible to illegal misuse, which could compromise patient privacy. Ensuring proper control over access to patient medical records is of paramount importance, with attribute-based encryption (ABE) emerging as a key technique for enforcing access control5. According to reports from the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)6 and the Journal of Healthcare Security7, approximately 81% of healthcare records of Americans have been compromised between 2009 and 2023. In 2023 alone, data breach costs for healthcare organizations reached a record $7, 13 million, a 10% increase over the previous year. These security and privacy breaches present substantial barriers to the effective management and sharing of health records. Thus, there is an urgent need for innovative solutions that ensure the secure and controlled sharing of sensitive medical information among different participants without risking data disclosure or manipulation. An efficient data access mechanism is essential to ensure data security and restrict access to authorized users only. Patients should have the autonomy to decide who can access their medical information8.

In recent years, a variety of healthcare applications have been developed that leverage blockchain technology. Azaria et al. introduced MedRec, the first functional shared Electronic Health Record (EHR) system that utilizes blockchain, although it raises concerns related to confidentiality and privacy9. FHIRChain, a system similar to MedRec, uses cryptographic techniques to encrypt and securely share data among clinicians10. Another framework proposed by Dubovitskaya et al. shares similarities with MedRec, allowing patients to share their health records but lacking a mechanism for consent revocation management11. The Centralized Electronic Health Record systems exhibit significant architectural limitations, as demonstrated in Fig. 1. The dependence on opaque third-party storage solutions creates inherent vulnerabilities in data governance, with users lacking visibility into data location and access patterns. These security concerns, visualized in Fig. 1, include risks of false data injection and system compromises that undermine healthcare data integrity.

Challenges in electronic health record (EHR) storage using centralized approach.

In contrast, MedShare utilizes blockchain technology to enforce access control and manage health data that is stored on the cloud but faces the challenge of scalability12. Current EHR management schemes13,14 suffer from a number of limitations, indicating demand for progressive solutions. First, there is a major security and privacy risk with the dependence on centralized third-party servers, such as cloud servers. Such centralized systems are susceptible to all sorts of cyber threats such as data breaches and hacker attacks. Healthcare data breaches have recently surged, highlighting the critical need to act upon these vulnerabilities. These challenges are further compounded by the inability of existing systems to ensure data privacy and access control. Such critical medical information can be stored in a centralized database and is vulnerable to unauthorized access and input. When data breaches are leaked, patient privacy is at risk, and even worse, the validity and confidentiality of medical records are called into question. Moreover, the absence of comprehensive systems to share and recover medical information safely restricts collaboration between healthcare providers with EHR to improve patient health.

With the advent of blockchain technology15 presents a transformative approach to tackling challenges in healthcare by enabling the secure, tamper-resistant, and decentralized storage of medical records. To mitigate these limitations, we developed a permissionless blockchain-based decentralized system that demonstrates superior performance in terms of response time, processing capacity, and success rate compared to traditional solutions16. Additionally, adopting a blockchain-based model can lead to reduced expenditures related to data administration and inter-institutional data exchange. This blockchain framework is particularly advantageous for enterprise-level applications, including healthcare, as it aligns with the current practices of hospitals and governmental regulatory authorities responsible for generating, overseeing, and regulating healthcare-related data. In the system we propose, access control is managed via the blockchain, while the medical data itself is securely stored in a decentralized file system, specifically the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). In contrast to conventional systems that centralize data, this design improves the system's resilience against security breaches, including Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks and data integrity threats.

The deficiencies of current medical record systems will have to be resolved by innovative and practical methodologies in medical record management17 A Potential Solution: Decentralization The central house of blockchain technology accompanied with decentralized file storage like IPFS. By leveraging the natural security properties of blockchain and the distributed nature of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), this approach aims to enhance confidentiality, integrity, and access to Electronic Health Records (EHR). Additionally, by integrating attribute-based encryption (ABE) into this framework, access to sensitive medical information is restricted to authorized users, thereby mitigating the threats of unauthorized access and compromising patient confidentiality. Not only does this strategy cut down on expenses surrounding the management and sharing of information, it makes use of blockchain so the medical histories are saved securely in a way that ensures they cannot be tampered with, and spread out across multiple systems.

The purpose of this article is to emphasize the significant gaps and weaknesses present in modern EHR systems18,19,20. Despite the ongoing adoption of EHR with the goal of optimizing healthcare delivery, existing centralized architectures expose healthcare data to substantial security and privacy risks. According to a recent research21, over 70%of healthcare organizations have suffered a data breach at one point in time, resulting in the exposure of millions of patient data. Additionally, HIPAA violations have also seen a rise, and data breaches in the healthcare sector accounts for 45% of all breaches in 2024 to date. Sadly, these alarming statistics illustrate the failings of centralized EHR systems that leave sensitive patient information exposed. Moreover, the rise of cybercriminal attacks in healthcare environments highlights the necessity for more secure and resilient solutions. Traditional security solutions are becoming insufficient to address the sophisticated threats that now target the healthcare industry22.

This paper demonstrates how a hybrid solution has been incorporated into medical record management that is securing medical records while also giving patients the opportunity to manage their own data. With the use of blockchain, The integration of Distributed File System (IPFS) and advanced data restriction mechanisms aims to address the inherent weaknesses of current systems, ensuring the privacy and integrity of sensitive medical data, thereby achieving the state-of-the-art in healthcare information management.

The key contributions are as follows:

Novel Cryptographic Framework: A novel cryptographic framework is developed to enhance the security and efficiency of attribute-based encryption (ABE) schemes. This framework introduces a more robust mechanism for handling dynamic user attributes, ensuring data privacy and security in decentralized environments.

Verifiable Keyword Search: Our scheme enables efficient retrieval of medical records through a verifiable keyword search mechanism. This allows users to swiftly identify and verify authentic medical records, enhancing reliability.

Fine-Grain Access Control: We implement granular access control mechanisms, assigning distinct access rights based on user attributes. This ensures only authorized individuals can decrypt and access sensitive medical information, enhancing data security and privacy.

Optimized Storage and Computational Costs: Our proposed EHRChain model significantly reduces the storage and computational costs compared to existing solutions. By employing advanced mathematical structures and optimization techniques, we achieve lower costs in key generation, setup, and search operations, as detailed in our experimental results.

First section provides an introduction to the motivations behind this research, outlines the drawbacks of existing systems, and presents the objectives of the study. Section “Related work” delves into the background study concerning the utilization of blockchain and IPFS in healthcare data management. Subsequently, Section “Our proposed EHRChain model” explains the proposed methodology, outlining the attribute-based encryption scheme and its integration with IPFS and blockchain technology. In “Ethereum smart contracts design”, is designed to ensure that the smart contracts are robust, efficient, and secure against various potential threats and vulnerabilities. Section “Result and discussion” details the experimental findings and performance assessment of the proposed system. In “Security analysis”, we discuss the implications of our findings and compare our approach with existing methodologies. Section “Conclusion and future work” presents the conclusions of this study and highlights potential directions for future research in this field.

In the medical industry, there is a high level of confidentiality that requires a high level of protection. Healthcare providers exchange this information frequently6. Participants often have difficulty sharing medical information since they may be exposed or have their data altered during the surgical procedure. In prior research23, efforts have been made to develop innovative blockchain solutions tailored for the storage and exchange of Electronic Health Records (EHR)20. However, some of these proposals have limitations, such as offering only basic privacy controls or advocating for the use of public blockchains with resource-intensive consensus mechanisms24. Other studies suggest utilizing permissioned blockchains for EHR storage, yet they fall short of providing detailed access control for patient information. The healthcare industry will be greatly impacted by blockchain technology. In addition, related studies have been published about blockchain in healthcare.

Blockchain technology17 emerges as a cutting-edge solution facilitating decentralized applications without reliance on a central authority, all while upholding crucial security attributes like data integrity, authenticity, non-repudiation, and accountability.

At its core, the blockchain data structure consists of interconnected blocks, each linked to its predecessor via cryptographic hash functions. The content of each block contributes to the generation of a hash value, which is then included as a reference in the subsequent block. The Bitcoin white paper was published by Satoshi Nakamoto in 200815, which marked a major technical advancement. Nakamoto envisioned a secure and safe money system using distributed ledger technology called the blockchain. Blockchain technology revolutionized the financial industry.

Structure of blockchain network.

In a Merkle Tree, each of its leaf nodes records the hash of the transaction, the value of each node within it is the hash of all its children, and the root node represents the entire tree's signature; a change in data will result in a different hash value as shown in the Fig. 2.

Puneet et al.25 conducted a pioneering study exploring the potential of blockchain technology in revolutionizing the healthcare sector. Their investigation revealed that the healthcare industry is predominantly governed by hospitals, pharmaceutical entities, and various intermediaries. They highlighted data sharing as a pivotal driver for integrating blockchain solutions into healthcare.

Dhasarathan et al. (2024)26 proposed a blockchain-based digital credentialing system for participatory governance using the Hyperledger Fabric platform, as also summarized in Table 1. Their system emphasizes transparent and secure issuance and verification of credentials via smart contracts, improving accountability in governance. The design includes modules for credential management, API integration, and smart contract deployment on permissioned blockchains. While their model demonstrates promising scalability and resilience against tampering, the authors acknowledge limitations such as interoperability challenges, scalability bottlenecks in large deployments, and user adoption barriers in real-world public administration settings. Table 1 provides an overview of existing blockchain-based approaches, outlining their primary contributions and associated limitations. This comparative synthesis serves to contextualize the challenges in current research and underscores the necessity of developing a more secure, scalable, and interoperable framework for electronic health record management.

The study identified four key transformative factors necessitating blockchain adoption in healthcare: digital access rights management, enhanced data availability, expedited access to clinical records, and streamlined patient identity verification. Additionally, the study deliberated on the intricacies of on-chain and off-chain data storage, addressing challenges such as managing voluminous clinical records, ensuring security and privacy, and fostering patient engagement.

Patil et al.,36 have proposed an ABE scheme for encrypting medical records on the cloud. Data on a patient's condition and the department that the doctor practices in were compiled without divulging the specific nature of their condition or their illness. However, the paper uses symmetric encryption, which must be implemented by an entirely transparent Global Authority, which will issue public parameters for the system and generate secret keys for the doctor, which is the main limitation of this scheme. A Hyperledger-based Blockchain system called MediChainTM was developed to manage medical data assets. The system is comprised of three components: an access control module, a data repository off-chain, and a user interface. The hashes of the medical data are placed on the blockchain while the data is stored off-chain on the cloud. This system, however, does not take interoperability into account. To provide integrity to patient records,13 proposed a Blockchain-based handshaking mechanism for integrating an existing cloud-based EHR system with a public Blockchain. There are some issues still associated with these strategies, such as preventing internal malicious activity and being protected from cloud server malfunctions, even though they offer secure cloud storage and fine-grained access control.

Don Charles et al.,27 explores the implementation of a blockchain-based payment system to facilitate a potential emissions trading scheme in the Caribbean region. The author discusses the use of blockchain technology to streamline cross-border transactions and enable efficient trading of emissions allowances. However, a potential shortcoming of this paper may be the lack of in-depth analysis on the practical challenges and feasibility of implementing such a system in the Caribbean context, including regulatory, technical, and economic considerations.

Gaur et al.,28 investigates abusive adversarial agents and attack strategies within cyber-physical systems. It delves into various forms of attacks and strategies employed by adversarial agents to compromise the integrity and security of cyber-physical systems. However, a potential shortcoming of this paper could be the limited exploration of defensive mechanisms or countermeasures to mitigate the identified threats, which could provide a more comprehensive understanding of cybersecurity in cyber-physical systems.

In Table 2, we present a comparative analysis between our proposed approach and the work by Ramesh et al. (2023)31. The table highlights key features crucial for blockchain-enabled Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems, including access control mechanisms, scalability, interoperability, security measures, data integrity, and performance optimizations. Our approach emphasizes multi-factor authentication (MFA) and attribute-based encryption (ABE) for robust access control, off-chain storage to efficiently manage large EHR datasets, and standardized data formats to enhance interoperability. In contrast, Ramesh et al. primarily focus on tamper-proof storage with basic access controls and blockchain-based data integrity. This comparison underscores the advancements and distinctive features of our methodology in addressing critical challenges in secure and scalable EHR management.

Namasudra et al.,24 proposed a decentralized and secure cab sharing system leveraging blockchain technology. It focuses on enhancing trust and security in ride-sharing services while decentralizing control and minimizing the need for intermediaries. However, a potential limitation of this work may be the scalability of blockchain-based systems in handling high transaction volumes and ensuring real-time responsiveness, especially in dynamic transportation environments. Further exploration into optimizing the performance and scalability of blockchain-based cab sharing systems may be necessary to address these challenges. Ramesh et al.31 introduced a blockchain-based solution for efficient and tamper-proof storage of Electronic Health Records (EHR) in decentralized cloud-assisted storage systems. The proposed text introduces a base for storage the use of blockchain to improve the security of EHR data and providing decentralization of storage to reduce single point of failures. However, there may be scalability issues within a blockchain system when it comes to managing vast amounts of EHR data and granting timely access to records in an emergency. Moreover, especially regarding transaction verification and consensus mechanisms, the overhead brought by blockchain could slow down the system negatively affecting efficiency and responsiveness. These challenges require further investigation to improve the performance of blockchain-based EHR storage solutions.

The blockchain-based information management systems, MedBlock6 and MedChain37, support secure and efficient access to electronic medical records. Blockchain technology was used to access medical information. MedBlock was conceived as a system for sharing healthcare data for diagnostic and research purposes. It gives patients access to their healthcare records. However, the adopted approach does not provide complete data privacy protection since local hospitals' databases are involved. Aside from that, MedBlock only holds hospital medical records of patients collected from medical examinations and does not store their physiological conditions. Currently, patients are unable to transfer their healthcare data and reports to the Blockchain network. In23 proposes MedChain as a circumvent to these limitations: a session-based healthcare data sharing system based on blockchain technology. In addition to managing and sharing patients' EHR, MedChain allows for sharing their physiological parameters from connected Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)) devices. Transparency and integrity are guaranteed with MediChain, but accessibility and scalability are seriously limited. Since the patient must manually share and upload data to a blockchain, the availability of the sharing service is dependent on availability. In addition, the proposed solution does not support the expansion of service providers within healthcare organizations.

The blockchain was discussed in the biomedical and healthcare sector in mishra et al.,38. There are several advantages offered by the use of blockchain for biomedical or healthcare domains, including decentralization, persistence of clinical or medical records, data quality control, and continuous access to data as well as secure information being accessible to healthcare stakeholders. Several challenges with blockchain technology include confidentiality, speed, scalability, and malicious attacks, such as 51% of attacks. As sensitive medical and clinical records are stored on these systems, these limitations are critical for the healthcare and biomedical sectors. According to the authors, these issues can be resolved with the use of VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) to ensure privacy, encryption of data, and off-chain storage of sensitive medical data.

In29 proposes a blockchain-based approach for preserving privacy in IoT-enabled healthcare systems. It focuses on leveraging blockchain technology to enhance data security and privacy in healthcare environments. However, a potential limitation of this paper may lie in the practical implementation and scalability of the proposed blockchain-based solution in real-world healthcare settings. Explore whether deploying such a system on large-platform healthcare infrastructures is practical through more conversations on the challenges this may pose. In30 Zheng et al. present another approach to privacy-preserving image recognition in remote sensing which makes use of limited visual cryptography. It aims to achieve better privacy protection for sensitive remote sensing data while facilitating accurate image recognition tasks. Yet, the only restriction this approach may face is with the large-scale remote sensing images and real-time requirements. This is particularly so since they do not always imply greater suitability and efficiency of the proposed method to manage broad and versatile remote sensing image datasets.

Datta et al.,32 present a blockchain-enabled smart contract model that combines consumer electronics and mobile edge computing to protect healthcare transactions. The model proposed in this paper combines blockchain technologies and smart contracts to strengthen security and privacy for healthcare transactions, along with consumer electronics and mobile edge computing for data processing and management. However, one of the limitations of this work can be the intricate nature and interoperability problems related to the introduction of wide-ranging consumer electronics, mobile edge computing, and blockchain technologies into the healthcare domain. To achieve the seamless integration and functionality of the proposed model in real-world healthcare environments, further research and development efforts may be needed.

In the proposed scheme, bilinear mapping is employed as a fundamental component for the implementation of attribute-based encryption (ABE). This choice is motivated by the unique properties and advantages that bilinear mappings offer, particularly in the context of secure and efficient access control mechanisms for electronic medical records (EMRs).

We denote both \(G_{0}\) and \(G_{1}\) as cyclic multiplicative groups composed of large prime numbers \(\rho\). Let \(\rho\) be an element of R and \({\mathscr {Q}}\) be the starting point for these groups, containing an element that maps to \(G_{T}\), the same class of cyclic multiplicative groups, represented by 1. The bilinear mapping \({\hat{e}}\) is defined as \({\hat{e}}: G_{1} \times G_{2} \rightarrow G_{T}\). \({\hat{e}}\) is considered a bilinear map if it satisfies the following criteria18,36: 

Bilinearity:

For any elements \(a, b \in {\mathscr {Z}}^*_{\rho }\), and \(\forall X \in G_0\), \(\forall Y \in G_1\), \({\hat{e}}(a \cdot X, b \cdot Y) = {\hat{e}}(X, Y)^{ab}\).

For any elements \(X, Y, Z \in G_0, G_1\), \({\hat{e}}(XY, Z) = {\hat{e}}(X, Y) \cdot {\hat{e}}(X, Z)\).

For any elements \(X, Y, Z \in G_0, G_1\), \({\hat{e}}(XY, Z) = {\hat{e}}(X, Z) \cdot {\hat{e}}(Y, Z)\).

Nondegeneracy: For any two elements X and Y, there exists at least one element X such that \({\hat{e}}(X \times X) \ne 1\).

Computability: For any elements \(\forall X \in G_0\), \(\forall Y \in G_1\), there exists at least one efficient way to compute \({\hat{e}}(X, Y) \in G_T\).

Let \({\mathscr {S}}\) denote a set of user attributes, represented as \({\mathscr {S}} = \{att_{1}, att_{2}, \ldots , att_{n}\}\). Each attribute \(att_{i}\) in \({\mathscr {S}}\) has a corresponding set \({\mathscr {L}}_{i}\) of possible values, where \({\mathscr {L}}_{i} = \{x_{i,1}, x_{i,2}, x_{i,3}, \ldots , x_{i,n}\}\), with n being the total number of possible values for each attribute39. Now, consider \({\mathscr {S}}\) as an attribute set of a user, defined as \({\mathscr {S}} = \{{\mathscr {S}}_{1}, {\mathscr {S}}_{2}, {\mathscr {S}}_{3}, \ldots , {\mathscr {S}}_{n}\}\), where \({\mathscr {S}}_{i}\) corresponds to \({\mathscr {L}}_{i}\). An access structure33, denoted by \({\mathscr {W}}\), is defined as \({\mathscr {W}} = \{w_1, w_2, \ldots , w_n\}\), with each \(w_i\) belonging to \({\mathscr {L}}_{i}\). The access policy \({\mathscr {S}}\) satisfies \({\mathscr {W}}\) if and only if \({\mathscr {W}}\) evaluates to 1. Specifically, \({\mathscr {W}} = \lambda _i \in I_{w}\), where the attribute list \({\mathscr {S}}\) is defined as \(\{att_{1}, att_{2}, \ldots , att_{n}\}\), and \(I_{w}\) is given by \(I_{w} = \{i \,|\, 1 \le i \le n, {\mathscr {W}}_i \ne * \}\). We say that \({\mathscr {S}}\) satisfies \({\mathscr {W}}\), denoted by \({\mathscr {S}} \models {\mathscr {W}}\), if \({\mathscr {S}}\) matches \({\mathscr {W}}_{i}\) for all i ranging from 1 to n; otherwise, \({\mathscr {S}} \nvDash {\mathscr {W}}\). It important to note that \({\mathscr {S}} \models {\mathscr {W}}\) if the attribute set \({\mathscr {S}}\) meets the access structure \({\mathscr {W}}\), i.e., \({\mathscr {S}}_{i}\) equals \({\mathscr {W}}_{i}\) for all \(i = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots , n\}\). Conversely, when \({\mathscr {S}}\) does not satisfy \({\mathscr {W}}\), it is represented as \({\mathscr {S}} \nvDash {\mathscr {W}}\).

In the proposed scheme, bilinear mapping is crucial for implementing attribute-based encryption (ABE), chosen for its unique properties that enhance secure and efficient access control for electronic medical records (EMRs). The specific reasons for using bilinear mappings over other hash functions include the following:

Bilinear mappings facilitate the construction of ABE schemes, allowing for fine-grained access control. This means access to encrypted data can be regulated based on the user's attributes rather than their identity, enabling a more nuanced and secure access control mechanism. Additionally, bilinear mappings support the encryption and decryption processes for complex access policies efficiently, which is critical for medical records where different users (e.g., doctors, nurses, administrators) require varying levels of access based on their roles.

The mathematical properties of bilinear maps are essential for ABE. For example, given groups \(G_1\) and \(G_2\) and a target group \(G_T\), a bilinear map \({\hat{e}}: G_1 \times G_2 \rightarrow G_T\) satisfies \({\hat{e}}(a \cdot X, b \cdot Y) = {\hat{e}}(X, Y)^{ab}\) for any elements \(a, b \in {\mathscr {Z}}^*_{\rho }\). This property is crucial for combining user attributes and access policies in a way that allows for efficient encryption and decryption. Furthermore, the nondegeneracy property ensures that there exists at least one pair \((X, Y) \in G_1 \times G_2\) such that \({\hat{e}}(X, Y) \ne 1\), providing meaningful cryptographic results essential for security. The computability property ensures that \({\hat{e}}(X, Y)\) can be computed efficiently for any \(X \in G_1\) and \(Y \in G_2\), which is important for practical implementation and performance.

The security of ABE schemes built on bilinear mappings relies on well-established cryptographic hardness assumptions, such as the Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (BDH) assumption. These assumptions provide strong guarantees against various cryptographic attacks, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of medical data.

Bilinear mappings also allow for dynamic user management, enabling the addition and revocation of users without requiring re-encryption of existing data. This scalability is vital in a healthcare setting where user roles and permissions frequently change. Furthermore, the scheme can efficiently handle updates to access policies, making it adaptable to changing security requirements and user roles.

In our proposed EHRChain model, four primary entities collaborate to ensure secure and efficient electronic health record management: the blockchain, the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), the medical system (comprising doctors and smart healthcare devices), and the data user system. These components collectively represent the main entities and operational processes that underpin our framework (see Fig. 3).

Our proposed EHRChain framework ensures secure data handling and scalable storage by integrating two core technologies: Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). ABE provides a fine-grained cryptographic access control mechanism that allows data owners to define access policies based on descriptive user attributes (e.g., role, department, or clearance level). Only users whose attributes satisfy the specified access policy can decrypt the associated data. This enables decentralized and flexible access control, aligning with the complex authorization requirements inherent in healthcare data sharing. For off-chain storage, EHRChain leverages IPFS, a peer-to-peer distributed file system that retrieves content using unique cryptographic hashes instead of traditional location-based addresses. Encrypted patient records are stored on IPFS, while their corresponding hash references are anchored on the blockchain. This design preserves data immutability and integrity, reduces on-chain storage overhead, and ensures efficient data retrieval. Together, ABE and IPFS form the foundational pillars of the EHRChain framework, facilitating privacy-preserving access control and scalable, decentralized storage for secure electronic health record management.

The medical system comprises physicians and smart devices of the system. Doctors are responsible for encrypting and saving medical records. They utilize encryption and indexing algorithms to secure medical records and generate indexes for keywords. The encrypted records are then stored in IPFS, and their hash values, along with IPFS hash addresses, are recorded on the blockchain. System smart devices handle the registration of hospital personnel, assigning secret private keys associated with their attributes.

Data users (DU) can be doctors, nurses, researchers, patients, etc. Each DU is assigned a key pair associated with their attributes by the system. To access medical records, a DU must request access from the hospital. After confirming their attributes meet system access policies, the DU receives a token to search for medical records.

In our scheme, medical data is stored and searched using the Ethereum blockchain platform. Since blockchains are immutable, they are a reliable source for verifying data authenticity and integrity, due to their inability to be arbitrarily modified.

IPFS enables permanent storage and sharing of various types of files. A unique hash value is assigned to each file based on its content. Furthermore, IPFS uses deduplication to effectively avoid redundant data storage. IPFS is used for medical records storage in our scheme.

In our proposed framework (see Fig. 3), a key feature of our proposed EHRChain Model is the incorporation of a fine-grained access control scheme, which ensures that only authorized users can access specific medical records. This access control mechanism is tightly integrated with advanced data encryption techniques, safeguarding sensitive patient information from unauthorized access. We utilize robust key management protocols to securely distribute and manage encryption keys, adding an additional layer of security. Furthermore, EHRChain Model employs a hybrid storage solution where actual medical data is stored in a blockchain-friendly off-chain tool like IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). The hash generated from storing data on IPFS is then placed on the blockchain. This approach combines the immutable and transparent properties of blockchain with the scalable and efficient storage capabilities of IPFS, ensuring both security and efficiency in managing large volumes of medical data.

Our proposed system model securely manages Electronic Health Record (EHR) using Ethereum blockchain and IPFS. Medical records are encrypted and stored on IPFS, with the hash address recorded on the blockchain. Authorized users can retrieve and decrypt the records, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality through cryptographic techniques.

This case study demonstrates the functionality and security features of our proposed EHRChain Model in real-world applications.

Step 1: The process begins with Dr. Bob documenting the necessary information of the patient, Alice. This information, denoted as \(P\), includes all relevant medical details.

Step 2:  Once the documentation is complete, Dr. Bob provides Alice with a private key, denoted as \(K_p\).

Step 3:  Alice's information \(P\) is then converted into a PDF document using a backend Node.js service.

Step 4:  The encrypted MongoDB symmetric key, denoted as \(E(K_{sym})\), is retrieved and decrypted using Dr. Bob's private key \(K_{bob}\).

where \(D_{K_{bob}}\) represents the decryption function using Dr. Bob's private key.

Step 5:  The symmetric key \(K_{sym}\) is then used to encrypt the PDF file.

where \(E_{K_{sym}}\) represents the encryption function using the symmetric key.

Step 6:  The encrypted PDF file \(E_{\text {PDF}}\) is stored on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). IPFS generates a Content Identifier (CID) for the stored file.

Step 7:  The generated CID is then stored in a block on the Ethereum blockchain network as part of a transaction.

This transaction ensures that the CID and, therefore,fore, the linencrypted patient information is immutable and securely stored on blockchain.

Step 8:  To secure the storage of a medical record R, the physician (e.g. Dr. Bob) initiates the encryption process. The medical record R is encrypted and signed to produce CT and sigR respectively. This encrypted record \(CT^* = (CT, sigR)\) is stored in IPFS, which provides a hash address h corresponding to \(CT^*\). Furthermore, the hash value hR of the medical record and an encrypted hash address h0 are transmitted to the blockchain as part of a transaction, generating a block ID.

Step 9:  When Alice needs to access her medical records, she sends an access request with keywords to the hospital. Upon verification, the system's smart contract issues a search token \(STw = (ID, h, \gamma )\) to the authorized Data User (DU), such as Alice or a healthcare provider. The block ID in the search token allows the DU to read the hash value h from the corresponding block on the blockchain. By comparing h with the hash address stored on the blockchain,kchain,kchain,kchain, the DU verifies the integrity of the record. Once validated, the DU retrieves the encrypted medical record \(CT^*\) from IPFS using the hash address h and decrypts it using their private key to access the original medical information. The proposed EHRChain model ensures that Alice's patient information is securely documented, encrypted, and stored in a decentralized manner, leveraging the security and transparency of blockchain technology.

The EHRChain framework is architected to support interoperability with widely recognized Electronic Health Record (EHR) standards, specifically Health Level Seven (HL7) and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). This interoperability is achieved through standardized API interfaces and a data translation layer capable of mapping blockchain-anchored metadata and IPFS-stored encrypted patient records into FHIR-compliant JSON resources message formats.

During the retrieval process, the framework queries the blockchain to obtain the corresponding IPFS content identifier, fetches the encrypted data, and converts them into a FHIR Patient or Observation resource for seamless integration with existing hospital information systems. In contrast, clinical data originating in HL7 format are processed by the ingestion module, which parses HL7 segments and maps them to the standardized schema of EHRChain prior to encryption and offline storage. By incorporating these mechanisms, EHRChain enables healthcare organizations to integrate the proposed blockchain-based system without disrupting existing EHR infrastructures, while maintaining data portability, regulatory compliance, and alignment with established interoperability frameworks.

In our proposed framework (see Fig. 4), administrators and users interact through a decentralized application (DApp). Users, such as doctors and patients, are assigned roles defined by the system administrator, typically a hospital administrator. These roles govern granular access to the system's functionalities and data, ensuring secure and controlled operations. This case study illustrates the real-world application of our proposed EHRChain Model. In our scheme, we simulate the process of a patient Alice, who has been admitted to the hospital and then returns home. This detailed process demonstrates the practical application of our proposedEHRChain Model, ensuring secure, efficient, and controlled access to medical records in a real-world healthcare setting.

EHRChain Model as an example, where administrators and users, including doctors and patients, interact through a decentralized application (DApp) where roles defined by the system administrator ensure secure and controlled access to medical data.

This case study demonstrates the functionality and security features of our proposed EHRChain Model in real-world applications. The following are the detailed steps to complete the process:

The administrator assigns roles, which include the Role Name and Account Address of the user, as shown in Fig. 4. Each user in the system has a role name and an account address. When a user requests an operation after roles have been assigned, the system checks the user's account address and role name from the Roles List. The functions can be performed if the validation is successful. The system then stores the information on the Ethereum Blockchain, which processes transactions for that information. Upon successful transaction confirmation, the system receives a success message from the blockchain layer, visible on the DApp browser, the interface of the proposed framework.

Given a security parameter \(\lambda\), the system initially generates a set of public parameters \((G1, G2, GT, \lambda , e, p, g1, g2)\), where G1 and G2 denote two cyclic multiplicative groups with prime order p. The elements g1 and g2 serve as generators for G1 and G2 respectively, with \(g1 \in G1\) and \(g2 \in G2\). Additionally, \(e: G1 \times G2 \rightarrow GT\) represents the bilinear map. Furthermore, a collision-resistant hash function \(H: \{0, 1\}^{\lambda } \rightarrow {\mathbb {Z}}_p^*\) is established.

Step 1: Registration and Diagnosis - Dr. Bob, a physician at the General Hospital, registers the patient Alice and generates a medical record R for him. The attributes for Alice are: \(S = \{name: Alice, age: 28, gender: male, identity: patient\}\), based on which a public-private key pair is generated.

Subsequently, the system proceeds to randomly select parameters \(\alpha , \beta , \sigma \in {\mathbb {Z}}_p^*\). For each attribute i, where \(1 \le i \le m_g\), the system generates random values \(a_{i,t} \in {\mathbb {Z}}_p^*\), where \(m_i\) denotes the total number of possible values for attribute i. For instance, if \(i = 1\) corresponds to a doctor, \(i = 2\) to a nurse, and \(i = 3\) to an expert, then \(m_1\) represents the total count of doctors, and \(m_3\) represents the total count of experts.

Finally, the system obtains the public key \(mpk = (G_P, e(g1, g2), H)\) and the master key msk.

The equation outlines the setup process for a cryptographic system utilizing bilinear pairings and random parameter generation. It initializes public parameters including cyclic multiplicative groups G1 and G2 with prime order p, along with generators g1 and g2. A bilinear map e and a hash function H are established. Random parameters \(\alpha\), \(\beta\), and \(\sigma\) are chosen, along with attribute-specific random values \(a_{i,t}\). Finally, the system computes the public key mpk and the master key msk incorporating these parameters.

The system has roles and account addresses for each user. A user's account address and role name are checked from the Roles List when they request an operation after roles have been assigned. If the validation succeeds, the functions can be performed. Meanwhile, the DU generates a search request utilizing its search private key and subsequently decrypts the medical records using its corresponding secret private key, which is linked to its set of attributes.

Initially, the system computes \(Y = e(g1, g2)^{\alpha }\), \(B = g^{\beta }_1\), \(u_1 = g^{\sigma }_1\), and \(A_{i,t} = g^{a_{i,t}}\), where \(1 \le t \le m_i\) and \(1 \le i \le m_g\). Subsequently, it derives the public-private key pair (pko, sko) as follows:

In Step 1, the system generates a public-private key pair for the Doctor. It computes \(Y = e(g1, g2)^{\alpha }\), \(B = g^{\beta }1\), \(u_1 = g^{\sigma }1\), and \(A{i,t} = g^{a{i,t}}\), where \(1 \le t \le m_i\) and \(1 \le i \le m_g\). The public-private key pair (pko, sko) is then derived as \(pko = (Y, B, u_1, A_{i,t}, 1 \le t \le m_i, 1 \le i \le m_g)\). and

The equation represents the private key components for the Doctor, denoted as \(\text {sko}\). It includes parameters such as \(\alpha\), \(\beta\), \(\sigma\), and \(a_{i,t}\) for \(1 \le t \le m_i\) and \(1 \le i \le m_g\).

The system randomly selects \(s \in {\mathbb {Z}}_p^*\) and computes \(D_1 = g^s_2\), \(u_2 = g^{\sigma }_2\), and \(D_2 = \prod _{t=1}^{m_i} u^{a_{i,t}}_2\). Additionally, it selects two random numbers \(x_i, \lambda _i \in {\mathbb {Z}}^*_p\), where \(1 \le i \le m_g\), and computes \(x = \sum _{i=1}^{m_g} x_i\), along with \(d_0 = g^{\alpha \cdot x \cdot \beta }\).

For each attribute number i where \(1 \le i \le m_g\), when \(S_i = v_{i,t}\), it computes \(d_{i,1} = g^{x_i}_2 \cdot A_{i,t}^{\lambda _i}\), \(d_{i,2} = g^{\lambda _i}_2\), resulting in the private key pair (sku, skS):

This equation represents the private key components for the Doctor, denoted as sko. It includes parameters such as \(\alpha\), \(\beta\), \(\sigma\), and \(a_{i,t}\) for \(1 \le t \le m_i\) and \(1 \le i \le m_g\).

The doctor prepares a medical record R for the Data User (DU) after diagnosing the \(DU's\) condition and then uploads the medical record R onto the IPFS. Initially, to encrypt the medical record R, the doctor defines the ciphertext policy as \(W = [W_1, W_2,..., W_m]\). Random values \(r_i\) are selected for each attribute number i, and the ciphertext CT is computed based on the policy and associated attributes. Moreover, the doctor signs the ciphertext to ensure its authenticity.

Next, the doctor uploads \(CT^* = (CT, sigR)\) via IPFS, which provides h for \(CT^*\). After storing medical records on the blockchain, the doctor logs the process. To obtain \(h_R = \text {SHA256}(h_R)\), he hashes the medical record R using the SHA256 hash function. With respect to h, he picks randomly \(\gamma \in {\mathbb {Z}}_p^*\) to calculate \(h_0 = h^\gamma\). After broadcasting a transaction and obtaining the block ID, he records the tuple \((h_R, h_0)\) on the blockchain.

To facilitate searching, the Doctor must create indexes for the stored medical records. Initially, he extracts the keyword \(w = (w_1, w_2,..., w_m)\) from the medical record R. Subsequently, he chooses a random value \(y \in {\mathbb {Z}}_p^*\) and calculates \(I_1 = g^y \cdot H(w_1||w_2||\dots ||w_m)\) and \(I_2 = u_1 \cdot \prod _{i,t \in W_i} A_{i,t}^y\). Consequently, the Doctor obtains the index as \(I = (I_1, I_2)\).

In this phase, the Data User (DU) intends to search for the keyword \(w_0 = (w_{01}, w_{02},..., w_{0m})\). Initially, the DU forwards a search request to the hospital. Upon identity verification of the DU by the system's smart device, a search token is provided.

The DU forwards a request to the hospital containing the keyword \(w_0 = (w_{01}, w_{02},..., w_{0m})\). Subsequently, the DU randomly selects \(z \in {\mathbb {Z}}_p\) and computes \(T_1 = D_{z,H}(w_{01}||w_{02}||\dots ||w_{0m})\) and \(T_2 = D_z^2\). The request \((T_1, T_2)\) is then sent to the hospital.

As soon as the Data User (DU) requests access, a test is performed by the smart device to determine whether the DU has authorization to access medical records containing \(w_0 = (w_{01}, w_{02},..., w_{0m})\). Initially, the system's smart device evaluates whether \(e(I_1, T_2)\) equals \(e(I_2, T_1)\). If \(e(I_1, T_2) = e(I_2, T_1)\), it signifies that the DU has permission to access the medical records containing the keywords \(w_0 = (w_{01}, w_{02},..., w_{0m})\). Afterward, the system's smart device sends \(ST_w = (ID, h, \gamma )\) to the DU, containing the block ID, the hash address h, and the random value \(\gamma\).

On the basis of the block ID provided in the search token \(ST_w\), the DU retrieves the tuple \((h_R, h_0)\) from the blockchain. In the next step, he calculates \(h_{00} = h^\gamma\) alongside \(h_0\) to validate the accuracy of h. If \(h_{00} = h_0\), he retrieves medical records which contain the keyphrase \(w_0 = (w_{01}, w_{02},..., w_{0m})\) from the IPFS. Using the SHA256 hash function, the DU hashes the decrypted medical record \(R'\) and compares it to the blockchain hash value. Medical records R that \(h_{[0R]} = h_R\) can be considered original if \(h_{[0R]} = h_R\).

The decryption operation in our proposed scheme is governed by a pairing-based computation, where the final result \(R'\) is derived by combining ciphertext components with user-specific decryption keys, as illustrated in Eq. (6). Once the Data User (DU) receives the ciphertext \(CT = (C_0, C_0, (C_{i,1}, C_{i,t,2})_{1 \le t \le m_i, 1 \le i \le m})\), he proceeds to decrypt it using his secure private key \(sk_S\). For each attribute number i, \(C'_{i,t,2} = C_{i,t,2}\) where \(S_i = (v_i, t_i)\). The decrypted medical record \(R'\) is computed as:

As shown in Eq. (6), the decryption result \(R'\) is computed through bilinear pairings over the ciphertext components and corresponding secret keys.

Smart contracts play a pivotal role in our DApp ecosystem, enabling essential operations and interactions. Our framework includes the following contracts:

Patient Records: Facilitating CRUD operations on patient records, ensuring secure and tamper-proof management.

Roles: Regulating user access and permissions within the DApp, maintaining data integrity and privacy.

These contracts are instrumental in realizing the functionalities of our proposed framework, ensuring seamless interactions and robust data management. The primary smart contract in our system is responsible for executing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on patient records while also defining access roles.

Secondly, the smart contract, known as Roles, comes from the OpenZeppel in library40, specifically the Asset library. This library offers tested and community-reviewed code, ensuring reliability. The Roles contract provides a granular role definition mechanism, making it an ideal choice for our system. In the following algorithm, we outline the operations and associated conditions of the Patient Records smart contract.

The following algorithms outline the functioning of the smart contract dedicated to patient records. It comprises five functions: role definition, addition, viewing, updating, and deletion of records. These functions are accessible to administrators and other system users.

The algorithm described in Algorithm 1 defines a function named AddPatientRecord, which is intended to be executed within a smart contract. This function is designed to facilitate the addition of new patient records to a healthcare system. It accepts as input the variables necessary to include data in a patient's record. Similar to the previous algorithm, this function begins by verifying the identity of the caller (msg.sender) to ensure that only authorized users, specifically doctors, can execute this function. If the caller is indeed a doctor, the function proceeds to insert the provided data into the specific patient's record. This typically involves creating a new entry in the database or appending the provided information to an existing patient record. However, if the caller is not identified as a doctor, the function terminates the session, preventing unauthorized access to the system. Overall, this algorithm provides a secure and controlled mechanism for adding new patient records within a blockchain-based healthcare system.

Add data: smart contract function

The algorithm described in Algorithm 2 defines a function named UpdatePatientRecord, which is intended to be executed within a smart contract. This function is designed to facilitate the updating of patient records in a secure and controlled manner.It given input to the values it needs to change within a patient's record. When invoked, the function first checks the identity of its caller (the msg. sender, so that only authorized users can use this function. It is checking, specifically, if the caller is a doctor. Assuming the caller is a doctor, the function then validates the supplied patient id and title against a stored patient. This step validates whether the provided doctor can update data of the specified patient. If the identifier and designation match what are currently stored in the patient record, the function goes ahead and updates the data. For example, this usually means updating the same fields in the patient record as you can provide input variables. If, on the other hand, the record is successfully changed, a call to the function returns a signal of success. If, in contrast, either the identifier or designation offered is inconsistent with the patient's record, the function returns a failure signal, indicating that the update had not been executed. Moreover, if the caller fails to identify himself or herself as a doctor, the function ends the session, denying them access to data such as patient records. This algorithm ensures up to date patient data without compromising patient confidentiality.

Update data: smart contract function

Algorithm 3 describes an algorithm that implements a function called AbortSession that can be run in a smart contract. It is designed for logging out from the health care system. This function does not require any input parameters like previous algorithms as it will end the ongoing session. What the function does is simply log you out or end your active session when you run it This is critical for maintaining security and privacy in the healthcare system, as users should be able to log out when they have completed their tasks or when they need to log out from the system. A simple in-session session termination within the smart contract would help improve the overall security and user experience of the healthcare application.

Abort session: smart contract function

The function implemented in Algorithm 4 is called DeletePatientRecord and it would be executed in a smart contract to delete patient records within the healthcare system. It takes the patient's ID, so it can go through the database and locate the exact record to delete.

This checks whether the requestor of the request is authorized, i.e., in the case the requestor is a doctor. Once confirmed to be a doctor, the function still checks if the provided patient identifier matches the patient that needs to be deleted from the registry. If the identifiers match, the function goes ahead and deletes the patient record and returns a success message. However, if the identifiers do not match, it means that the provided identifier does not correspond to an existing record so the function returns a failure message. If the sender is not, the function stops immediately to avoid an unauthorized doctor access. It helps protect the integrity and privacy of patient data for authorized medical personnel, who may, if need be, remove patient records while ensuring the protection of sensitive healthcare data.

Delete data: smart contract function

This pivotal section delves into the performance evaluation of the proposed framework, aimed at mitigating the risks associated with the adoption of this innovative technology. Through rigorous testing and analysis, we assess the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of the framework in addressing key challenges and vulnerabilities inherent in the adoption of novel technologies like blockchain-based solutions.

This crucial section focuses on the performance metrics of the suggested framework in minimizing the associated risks of implementing this sophisticated technology. Based on testing and assessment we investigate how well the framework quantities the challenges and vulnerabilities in the new technology, including efficiency, network/computation cost and robustness of solution relative to using a blockchain-based solution.

The experiment setup is crucial in evaluating the functionality and efficiency of any framework or system. For our study, we prepared an experimental set-up specifically designed for performance testing in order to reproduce the findings correctly and without distortion. Experimental Setup: The experiment environment includes the hardware configuration, software tools, transaction dataset, evaluation metrics, and performance evaluation methods.

All performance tests are done in a high-end desktop machine where we have more than sufficient processors, RAM, and so on. Hardware Configuration: Intel Core i7-6498DU CPU at 2.50GHz (base) and up to 2.60GHz (turbo boost) For RAM, the system sported 8.00 GB, or enough memory to run demanding computational processes. The Windows 10 operating system, specifically the 64-bit variant, was used for the desktop computer to test for compatibility and stability.

To carry out the simulation, deployment, and evaluation of the proposed framework, development tools used in the experimental environment are important that systematically ensured the correct implementation of the simulation and experimental processes. We were able to leverage different tools which served for the different purposes and contributed to the overall process of performance testing.

Using Remix – an online Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing, compiling, and deploying Ethereum smart contracts – made it possible to conduct programming in an easy to use interface. Simulation and development of the smart contracts that forms our suggested framework using Remix IDE With its web-based interface, it facilitated direct interaction with the Ethereum blockchain, allowing for on-spot testing and debugging of smart contracts.

For the dApp, we use Metamask41, an Ethereum browser extension that is used as a digital wallet and as a bridge between web browsers and the Ethereum blockchain. In order to deploy and test the smart contracts on the Ethereum test network (Rinkby), we use Metamask. This made signing and broadcasting transactions easy and allowed the execution of smart contracts in the sandbox, simplified by its integration with different web browsers.

The proposed framework was built around Solidity, the programming language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Smart Contract Implementation - Solidity We used Solidity to implement the logic and functionality of smart contracts governing our proposed system. We utilized Solidity for our smart contracts and integrated them with Remix IDE to ensure the integrity of transactional items we were dealing with this way, adding the final layer of usability to our experimental environment.

To simulate a realistic healthcare data environment, we generated a synthetic dataset comprising 5,000 electronic health record (EHR) transactions. Each transaction emulates common operations in a decentralized medical data management system, such as role assignment, patient record creation, update, retrieval, and deletion. The dataset was constructed to reflect typical healthcare system dynamics, incorporating various user roles (e.g., physicians, administrative staff, and data users) and record attributes such as patient identifiers, medical categories, timestamps, access privileges, and digital signatures.

The simulated transactions were subjected to Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) based on dynamic policy structures and were subsequently offloaded to IPFS for decentralized storage. Only the cryptographic hashes of these files were anchored to the Ethereum testnet, mimicking real-world system behavior while ensuring system efficiency and privacy compliance. This dataset model enabled us to assess how well the proposed EHRChain framework handles concurrent access, access control enforcement, and decentralized data storage under realistic operational conditions.

The experimental evaluation was guided by a multi-dimensional set of performance criteria aimed at assessing the system's responsiveness, scalability, and resource efficiency under varied workloads. The core evaluation metrics include:

Execution Time: This metric quantifies the temporal duration between the submission of a smart contract transaction and its successful confirmation on the blockchain. It reflects the computational and network delays associated with contract deployment and function invocation.

Throughput (Transactions/sec): Defined as the average number of successfully processed transactions per unit time. This measures the system's capacity to handle concurrent operations, a critical factor in scalable healthcare infrastructure.

Latency: Measured as the delay between a user-initiated request and the receipt of a system response. This includes smart contract call delays and consensus-related propagation times across the blockchain network.

Gas Consumption and Transaction Fees: Each smart contract function incurs a gas cost, which is converted into Ether based on current gas prices. We calculated the financial cost of deploying and executing AssignRoles, AddRecord, ViewRecord, UpdateRecord, and DeleteRecord operations to analyze the cost-effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

Storage Overhead: We evaluated the memory footprint introduced by storing encrypted EHRs on IPFS and maintaining their metadata on-chain. The analysis includes transaction payload sizes and their effect on blockchain bloat and off-chain storage scalability.

The experimental setup leveraged Remix IDE42 for Solidity-based smart contract testing, Metamask for transaction signing41, and the Ethereum Rinkeby testnet for blockchain emulation. Apache JMeter was configured to simulate multi-user access patterns and concurrency levels ranging from 100 to 500 simultaneous users. Performance profiling was conducted in real time, enabling us to benchmark execution time variations, stress-test system throughput, and evaluate responsiveness under transactional load. This comprehensive performance evaluation demonstrates the viability of our framework for secure, scalable, and decentralized healthcare data management in practical deployment scenarios.

The performance measurement method comprises analysis of transaction data and transaction information during the execution of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. These transaction metrics are the transaction implementation time (tx1) and the transaction completion time (tx2). Transaction deployment time was the time taken to deploy a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, while Transaction Completion Time was the time needed for a transaction to complete and to be confirmed by the blockchain network.

We perform simulations of real-world scenarios to evaluate how well our custom framework performs under the different quoting conditions. For this application, Apache JMeter was used as a performance testing tool to analyze the application's performance. To run these tests, we set up Apache JMeter to simulate multiple concurrent users using the system at the same time and record execution time, throughput, and latency as performance metrics. Through a rigorous analysis of the performance data and an in-depth evaluation of the framework, we obtained meaningful insights into its scalability, efficiency, and reliability.

The average time taken to execute various transactions on the blockchain was measured. For instance, single-user functions such as “Assign Roles”, “Add Patient Records”, and “View Patient Records” exhibited execution times of approximately 18.29 s, 1 min 48 s, and 50 s respectively. These times increased proportionally with the number of concurrent users, demonstrating the scalability of our framework.

The throughput of the system, represented in KB/sec, was assessed using Apache JMeter. Simulations were conducted with user loads ranging from 100 to 500. The results, depicted in Fig. 5, show the system's ability to handle varying loads efficiently.

Throughput of the our proposed EHRChain framework.

Latency, defined as the delay between sending a request and receiving a response, was evaluated using JMeter. Latency is measured in milliseconds.

Average latency of our proposed EHRChain framework.

The average latency, or the delay between sending a request and receiving a response, was also evaluated using JMeter. The highest recorded latency in our experiments was 14 milliseconds, as shown in Fig. 6. This metric is crucial for understanding the system's responsiveness under different conditions.

There is a data payload field in every Ethereum transaction. The transaction includes a data payload, which is used to invoke the smart contract. The data payload is encoded in hexadecimal format and consists of bytes. In this section, we will discuss two Algorithm functions that we can use to gain a deeper understanding of data payload included in transactions.

An optional data payload field is used when interacting with contract functions during a transaction. It consists of two parts:

Function Selector

Function Arguments

Keccak-256 hash identifies a smart contract function by the first four bytes of the function selector. There are several types of static and dynamic elements in the function arguments, each of which is encoded differently in the payload. For an understanding of how data is generated, let us examine the payload from the Define Roles function in Algorithms. As a first step, we will separate the argument selector from the function selector. Function selectors are function signatures, such as the following: 0x 28e4a6af  In this case, the function selector represents the hashed string of DefineRoles(address,uint256). In the data payload, the arguments are added after the function selector. This argument includes the new account address and the new role.

Convert all the inputs into their hexadecimal representations and concatenate all this data. The payload is included in the transaction afterward. Lastly, by looking at the data payload we can get useful information about state changes in Ethereum transactions and smart contracts. When we can split the transaction payloads into their function selector and function arguments, we get a more in-depth look at how the smart contracts work. This emphasizes allows us to optimize the encoding and processing of these elements, further improving transaction efficiency. We use the types of the arguments in our functions to differentiate static and dynamic types, which allows us to use our channels more effectively as an encoding mechanism. This difference is an important one for reducing the amount of data sent in each payload and thus for enhancing the throughput of Ethereum transactions. We present a framework for estimating transaction sizes and costs around data payloads. Such an estimation is critically important to the understanding and management of the economic side of implementing blockchain-based solutions in healthcare.

Assuming a gas rate of 21 Gwei and a consumption rate of 21,000, we can calculate the transaction fee as follows:

This shows the fee calculation in both Ether and Gwei units. We provide a thorough analysis of the costs associated with Ethereum transactions, including gas consumption and transaction fees. Our framework includes strategies to optimize these costs, making it more economical for real-world applications. The framework incorporates advanced cryptographic techniques to enhance the security of medical records. By ensuring secure storage and transmission of sensitive data, our approach addresses significant security concerns in healthcare data management. The proposed framework is designed to be highly scalable and applicable to real-world scenarios. We validate its performance using real-world data and a comprehensive experimental setup, demonstrating its practicality and effectiveness in managing medical records. We introduce and evaluate specific performance metrics such as execution time, latency, and throughput using tools like Remix, Metamask, and the Rinkeby test network. These metrics provide a clear and quantifiable measure of the framework performance improvements.

The storage and computational costs analysis about the different algorithms in Sharma et al. (2024)43, Sultana et al. (2024)21, and in our proposed study respectively.

The storage costs of the three schemes are presented in Fig. 7. It appears that although our scheme incurs a higher storage cost in the KeyGen algorithm compared to schemes Sharma et al. (2024)43 and Sultana et al. (2024)21, the storage costs in Setup/Init, Trap/Index, and Search are significantly lower than those schemes.

In this function, both static and dynamic types have a 32-byte size. A 64 byte function has a total byte size of 64 bytes.

We can estimate the transaction sizes of our proposed framework by using the data payload. These transactions' sizes are shown in Table 3. Moreover, it is important to remember that the transaction size calculated in this section is based on the data payload and specifically calculated for each function. In contrast, the transaction size has been calculated from a block size perspective and is a generalized calculation.

In addition, the proposed framework allows us to calculate the cost associated with various transactions. There are certain units associated with Ethereum, such as wei and gwei, which are used for calculating transaction fees. This article also discusses the formula for calculating Ethereum transactions fees. For a transaction, the transaction fee is calculated by multiplying gas consumed by gas price.

The performance of the proposed EHRChain framework was rigorously evaluated with respect to two primary operational metrics: scalability, quantified as Transactions Per Second (TPS), and latency, defined as the mean transaction finality time from request submission to blockchain confirmation. Comparative analysis was conducted against two representative blockchain-based EHR management models: (i) Ramesh et al. (2023)31, which employs a fully on-chain architecture with Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), and (ii) Sharma et al. (2024)43, which adopts a blockchain–cloud hybrid approach leveraging conventional symmetric encryption for off-chain data handling. The performance of the proposed EHRChain framework was evaluated against existing approaches by Ramesh et al. (2023) and Sharma et al. (2024). As illustrated in Fig. 8, EHRChain consistently achieves higher throughput in terms of transactions per second while maintaining significantly lower latency under varying concurrent user loads. This demonstrates the scalability and efficiency of our framework compared to prior solutions.

Performance comparison between EHRChain, Ramesh et al. (2023), and Sharma et al. (2024). (a) Scalability in TPS. (b) Average transaction latency in milliseconds.

EHRChain was deployed with a hybrid PoS+PBFT consensus protocol and integrated with the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for off-chain storage. Performance benchmarking was conducted using the Hyperledger Caliper framework, with simulated transaction loads of 100, 300, and 500 concurrent requests. To ensure methodological rigor, identical transaction payloads and system configurations were applied across all comparative models. EHRChain demonstrated superior throughput characteristics under increasing workloads. At 500 concurrent transactions, the framework sustained a throughput of 248 TPS, corresponding to a 7.4% degradation relative to the 100-user baseline (268 TPS). By contrast, Sharma et al.43 model achieved 198 TPS (12.2% degradation), while Ramesh et al.31 fully on-chain system recorded 143 TPS (21.6% degradation). These results indicate that the decoupling of bulk EHR data from on-chain storage significantly mitigates consensus bottlenecks, thereby enhancing scalability.

EHRChain also outperformed the baseline systems in transaction finality time. At peak load, the average latency was 412 ms, representing a 47.2% reduction relative to Ramesh et al. (781 ms) and a 26.8% reduction compared to Sharma et al.43 (563 ms). The latency gains are attributable to reduced block payload sizes, parallelized IPFS retrieval, and an optimized consensus configuration tuned for healthcare transaction patterns. The empirical results confirm that EHRChain maintains high throughput and low latency under concurrent load conditions typical of real-world healthcare environments. The hybrid consensus protocol, combined with off-chain IPFS storage, delivers a balanced performance profile that addresses both the scalability limitations of fully on-chain systems and the latency constraints of cloud-based hybrids. Consequently, the framework is well-positioned for deployment in scenarios demanding real-time, privacy-preserving, and high-volume medical data exchange.

During the search process, if the attributes set \(S = \{S_1, S_2, \ldots , S_m\}\) satisfies the access policy \(W = \{W_1, W_2, \ldots , W_m\}\), where \(W_i \in L_i\), then,

If \(w_0 = w\), and \(e(I_1, T_2) = e(I_2, T_1)\), this means that the DU has the privilege to access the medical record containing the keywords \(w_0 = \{w_{01}, w_{02}, \ldots , w_{0m}\}\). During the decryption process, if the attributes set \(S = \{S_1, S_2, \ldots , S_m\}\) satisfies the access policy \(W = \{W_1, W_2, \ldots , W_m\}\), where \(W_i \in L_i\), then,

A challenge policy is proclaimed by the adversary at the beginning of the game, with \(W_0\) and \(W_1\). The notation we use is \(W_b = \{W_{b,1}, W_{b,2}, \ldots , W_{b,m}\}\) these are expressed as \(b \in \{0, 1\}\). There is no proof in the literature that an adversary is capable of winning the original game G. Thus, we prove that our scheme is secure by exploiting the indistinguishability of \(G, G_0, \ldots , G_{l-1}, G_l\).

Changing the ciphertext component of game G first results in a new game \(G_0\). In-game \(G_0\), if the adversary does not have \(sk_S\) generated from S such that \(S \models W_0 \wedge S \models W_1\), the adversary will choose a random number in GT as the ciphertext component \(C_0\), while the rest will remain unchanged. Aside from the b, the adversary generates component \(C_0\) which is the same as in-game G based on their attribute S. In this case, \(G = G_0\).

Assuming asymmetric DBDH, the difference in adversary advantage A between games G and \(G_0\) is negligible with the security parameter k.

Given the asymmetric challenge tuple \(h(g_1, g_2, g_{Z11}, g_{Z12}, g_{Z22}, g_{Z23}, Z)\), where \(Z = e(g_1, g_2)^{Z1Z2Z3}\) is equivalent to a random number with the same probability. \(hfill\square\)

Init: When the adversary A promises to simulate B two challenge ciphertext policies \(W_0\) and \(W_1\), then B flips a random coin b, in which \(b \in \{0, 1\}\). If \(b = 1\), then \(Z = e(g_1, g_2)^{z_1z_2z_3}\), else Z is a variable.

Setup: The simulator B starts by getting the system public parameter using the security parameter \(\lambda\). A public key \(pk_0\) is then generated for adversary A using the KeyGen algorithm. Using the simulator B first sets \(Y = e(g_1, g_2)^{z_1z_2}\), \(B = g^{z_1^2}\), \(u_1 = g^{z_3}\), this implies \(\alpha = z_1z_2\), \(\beta = z_2\), \(\sigma = z_3\). The simulator generates \(A_{i,t}\) for each attribute number ij, if \(1 \le i \le m\), \(1 \le j \le m\), it generates \(A_{i,t}\), if \(v_{i,t} \in W_{b,i}\), the simulator B sets \(A_{i,t} = g^{\alpha _{i,t}}\). Otherwise, the simulator B sets \(A_{i,t} = g^{z_{11}^{\alpha _{i,t}}}\), where \(z_{11} \in {\mathbb {Z}}_p^*\) varies. Last but not least, the simulator B publishes public parameters Y, B, \(u_1\), \(A_{i,t}\).

The security proof our proposedEHRChain model involves a thorough evaluation to ensure its robustness against potential vulnerabilities. EHRChain utilized the open-source tool Oyente, which applies symbolic execution techniques to scrutinize smart contracts by executing functions step by step. Oyente operates exclusively with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and does not require access to high-level representations like Solidity or Serpent. Our focus was on bolstering the security of a blockchain-based healthcare system designed for managing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) securely. Step 1. In frame number 1, Alice is a healthcare provider who interacts with a critical smart contract in our blockchain healthcare system that handles the access control to patient records. The goal was to employ strong security practices to protect patient data privacy, correctness, and availability. Step 2. we chose Oyente, as it has the ability to symbolically execute and systematically explore paths in Ethereum smart contracts. Insolvency for example, If contract malicious user invokes it – This would allow for detailed examination of possible entry points for attacks like reentrancy, integer overflow or underflow, out-of-gas errors, unexpected state changes and cross-function state changes, etc. Step 3. The step-by-step simulation performed by Oyente explores different execution paths and input variations to find vulnerabilities. During this audit, it found a critical reentrancy vulnerability in the access control function of our smart contract. An attacker named Bob could use recursive calls to adjust privileges and attack the program using this vulnerability. Step 4. After discovering the reentrancy vulnerability, our development team applied the “Checks-Effects-Interactions” pattern in the code of the smart contract. This guarantees that all critical functions begin with condition validation (Checks), state modification based upon validated conditions (Examples), and secure external interaction handling (Interactions). This added a layer of protection only an internal call to the guard would let the process continue, and when reentrancy was detected it would revert the entire transaction. Step 5. After implementing the mitigation strategies, we re-executed Oyente to check if our mitigation strategies were effective. Later reports showed a marked decrease in flagged vulnerabilities, a sign that the effort was leading to an enhanced security posture and greater resilience to the common threats faced by blockchain projects. Step 6. This work illustrates how the use of Oyente for tool-based assessment allowed to discover serious vulnerabilities and in addition to address their effective mitigation in our blockchain-based healthcare system. This perspective safeguards patient data saved onboard development while also navigating developing security hazards.

The security analysis, illustrated in Fig. 9, indicates that the majority of the outputs in the analysis report are “False,” which means that the smart contract in our proposed model is resilient against many well-known vulnerabilities. This underscores the robustness and security of the proposed model. However, the analysis revealed vulnerabilities in two areas: integer overflows and integer underflows. Both of these vulnerabilities are manageable and temporary. An integer overflow occurs when the number of integers required to execute a function exceeds the specified limit, while an underflow occurs when the number of integers falls below the threshold necessary for the function to run properly.

Security proof of our proposed EHRChain system model.

A comparative evaluation of blockchain-based methodologies focusing on access control, scalability, and contributions to the field is presented in Table 4. This table contrasts previous studies with the proposed EHRChain model, demonstrating how our approach uniquely integrates blockchain, fine-grained access control, and scalability features to address gaps identified in the existing literature.

To assess computational costs among the three schemes, we define time-consuming operation symbols, including the bilinear pairing operation (\(OP\)) and exponentiation operations (\(OE\)). From Fig. 7, the evident that our scheme exhibits superior efficiency in the Init, Index, and Search algorithms, except for the KeyGen algorithm. Furthermore, considering the different result verification mechanisms, we analyzed the computational costs only in our scheme and the Sharma et al. (2024) scheme29. Based on the above information, we can infer that our scheme facilitates access control without introducing additional storage and computational overhead. However, further verification of this fact is necessary.

In healthcare systems, access control mechanisms must strike a balance between preserving patient privacy and ensuring rapid data availability, particularly during mission-critical situations such as medical emergencies, natural disasters, or rapid administrative changes in user roles. Traditional Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) offers a robust fine-grained access control paradigm, yet it exhibits inherent limitations in handling exceptional access requirements and dynamically revoking privileges. The proposed EHRChain framework addresses these challenges by incorporating advanced extensions to the baseline ABE model, specifically to support:

Emergency access provisioning – granting controlled, short-term access to patient data under verified urgent conditions.

Revocation of access rights – removing user privileges promptly when their authorization status changes or security risks are detected.

Under conventional ABE, decryption is rigidly policy-bound: if a user attribute set does not match the embedded access policy, access is unequivocally denied. While this ensures strict adherence to predefined policies, it can hinder timely interventions in acute medical emergencies, where treating physicians or authorized responders may require immediate access to life-critical patient data.

Our proposed EHRChain introduces a context-aware override mechanism facilitated through a dedicated EmergencyAccess attribute. This attribute is issued by a designated authority, such as a hospital administrator, security officer, or a smart contract-governed trust entity, following the verification of emergency conditions. The mechanism is designed with the following safeguards:

Time-bound validity: Emergency access credentials are embedded with cryptographically enforced expiration timestamps, automatically revoking privileges after the predefined duration (e.g., 30 minutes to 2 hours), thereby preventing prolonged or unmonitored access.

Scope-limited access: Emergency attributes are strictly bound to relevant datasets or patient records associated with the ongoing critical event, minimizing unnecessary data exposure.

Immutable on-chain auditability: Each emergency access request, approval, and usage instance is permanently recorded in the blockchain ledger, enabling post-incident forensic analysis, regulatory compliance verification, and deterrence against misuse.

Multi-factor verification: Prior to attribute issuance, an additional verification layer–such as biometric confirmation or secondary authorization from another administrator–can be enforced to strengthen trust in the emergency request.

This design ensures that emergency access is operationally efficient while preserving the overarching privacy and compliance guarantees of the system.

Access revocation presents a well-documented challenge in traditional ABE systems, as the attribute–ciphertext relationship is static and re-encryption typically requires system-wide re-keying. In healthcare settings, where staff assignments, operational roles, and trust statuses can change frequently, this limitation can result in security risks if not addressed effectively.

To overcome this, EHRChain incorporates a dual-layered revocation strategy:

Expiration-based key validity: All attribute keys are issued with cryptographically embedded expiration timestamps. Users must periodically request renewed keys, which are only issued if their current role and authorization remain valid, thereby automatically removing access for inactive or reassigned personnel.

Proxy-assisted re-encryption: Upon the occurrence of a revocation event, such as role reassignment, employment termination, or detected key compromise, a trusted proxy entity (e.g., a hospital blockchain node) re-encrypts affected ciphertexts using updated access policies. This ensures that previously valid credentials cannot be used to decrypt data post-revocation, without necessitating full re-keying of the entire user base.

The integration of proxy-assisted re-encryption provides a scalable and resource-efficient mechanism for dynamic policy enforcement, essential for large-scale healthcare deployments.

The practical realization of the proposed EHRChain framework is grounded in healthcare-specific regulatory, operational, and compliance imperatives, ensuring its suitability for deployment in real-world clinical environments. The framework adopts a permissioned blockchain architecture in conjunction with a consortium-governed IPFS network, enabling authenticated participation within a secure and controlled trust domain. This design not only mitigates the risk of unauthorized node inclusion but also inherently satisfies the stringent privacy, security, and accountability requirements associated with the management of sensitive electronic health information. From a regulatory perspective, EHRChain is architected to align with internationally recognized compliance regimes, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the United States, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union, and established interoperability specifications such as HL7 and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). Conformance with these standards is achieved through the integration of Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) for fine-grained, policy-driven access control; immutable blockchain-anchored transaction logs for verifiable auditability; and the off-chain storage of encrypted EHR data within IPFS to prevent unauthorized data disclosure. Collectively, these mechanisms safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of medical records while supporting comprehensive compliance auditing.

Operational viability is reinforced through the modular and standards-compliant architecture of the framework, which facilitates seamless integration with existing Hospital Information Systems (HIS) and Regional Health Information Exchanges (HIE) without necessitating disruptive infrastructure replacement. This integration model reduces deployment complexity and cost while preserving continuity of care and existing clinical workflows. Furthermore, as demonstrated in “Scalability and latency analysis of the EHRChain framework”, empirical performance evaluations confirm that EHRChain sustains high throughput and low latency transaction processing under varying concurrent user loads, validating its scalability and robustness for large-scale healthcare ecosystems.

In addition, governance policies embedded within the permissioned network enforce role-based participation, transaction validation rules, and jurisdiction-specific compliance constraints. These measures ensure that deployment across multiple healthcare organizations can be tailored to local regulatory requirements while maintaining interoperability across the broader ecosystem. As such, EHRChain not only offers a technically robust solution but also demonstrates regulatory and operational readiness for secure, scalable, and privacy-preserving electronic health record management in diverse healthcare settings.

This research presents a comprehensive evaluation of a novel framework aimed at enhancing the security and efficiency of blockchain-based medical record management systems. Utilizing Ethereum smart contracts and detailed transaction payload analysis, the study explores various aspects of performance, including execution time, latency, and throughput. Our findings indicate that the proposed framework offers substantial improvements over existing methods. Through rigorous testing using tools like Remix, Metamask, and the Rinkeby test network, we have shown that the framework can handle complex transactions with improved speed and reduced delays. The detailed analysis of transaction payloads and their encoding demonstrates the robustness and scalability of our approach, ensuring that the system can support a high volume of transactions while maintaining security and integrity. Furthermore, the study provides insights into the costs associated with Ethereum transactions, offering a clear understanding of the economic implications of deploying such a framework in real-world scenarios. The research introduces a robust framework to enhance the security and efficiency of blockchain-based medical record management systems, showcasing significant performance improvements in execution time, latency, and throughput. However, the conclusion lacks explicit mention of the study's limitations. Future work will address this by focusing on implementing attribute revocation functions for better access control, integrating smart contracts to enhance data functionality, exploring advanced cryptographic techniques for improved security, investigating interoperability with other blockchain platforms, optimizing gas consumption for cost-effectiveness, developing dynamic access control algorithms, and conducting real-world implementation and testing in healthcare environments to validate the practical utility of the framework and identify potential challenges.

Future studies could also delve into optimizing the gas consumption and transaction fees associated with Ethereum, making the framework more cost-effective for large-scale deployments. Another potential direction is the development of more sophisticated algorithms for dynamic access control, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific medical records based on evolving policies and user roles. Finally, real-world implementation and testing in healthcare environments will be crucial to validate the framework's practical utility and identify any additional challenges that may arise in a production setting. These future efforts will help in refining the framework, making it a viable solution for secure and efficient medical record management on the blockchain.

Wall Street's growing interest in late-stage cryptocurrency firms could disrupt the traditional boom-and-bust cycle of digital assets, according to new research.

Crypto financial services firm Matrixport said Friday that more than $200 billion worth of crypto companies are preparing initial public offerings (IPOs), which may raise between $30 billion and $45 billion in new capital.

Matrixport said investor focus is rotating away from early-stage bets toward scalable, IPO-ready companies positioned for public markets.

Continued selling by Bitcoin (BTC) miners and early adopters has “nearly neutralized ETF and treasury inflows, reducing volatility and dampening Bitcoin's appeal to risk-seeking investors,” Matrixport said in a Friday X post. “Wall Street, however, has every incentive to extend the bull market, with up to $226 billion in crypto IPOs waiting in the pipeline that could raise $30 - $45 billion in new capital.”

The report comes as multiple high-profile crypto firms are preparing IPO plans, including crypto exchange Kraken, which reportedly recently secured $500 million in funding at a $15 billion valuation, according to unidentified sources cited by Fortune on Sept. 25.

The news came less than a week after crypto custodian BitGo filed to list its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under a US IPO filed on Sept. 19. The Palo Alto-based company reported about $90.3 billion in assets under custody and a user base of 4,600 entities and 1.1 million users.

ETFs signal “paper-backed altseason” for select altcoins

Matrixport's report supports previous insights from industry watchers, who predicted that the 2025 crypto market cycle will not feature an altcoin season akin to previous years, but will only see select altcoins with institutional backing or outstanding exchange-traded fund (ETF) filings outperform the rest of the market.

Still, some analysts argue that onchain dynamics point to the beginnings of an altcoin season.

“While many investors remain myopically focused on Bitcoin, ETH is quietly outperforming in the background” as Bitcoin dominance drops toward “year lows,” according to Nic Puckrin, crypto analyst and co-founder of crypto educational resource The Coin Bureau.

“Historically, these have been the signals of a reversal into altcoins,” though he stressed the trend has been selective so far.

Other analysts are pointing to the pipeline of ETF filings awaiting approval as the next potential catalyst for the incoming altcoin season.

“Entering paper-backed altseason,” said Ki Young Ju, the founder and CEO of blockchain analytics platform CryptoQuant, in a Monday X post.

This comes as the crypto industry awaits the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) decision on outstanding crypto ETF filings related to at least five tokens, which were submitted during October.

Canary Capital's Litecoin LTCUSD ETF's deadline was set for Oct. 2, but the SEC kept silent on the ETF filing. It is unclear whether the lack of response is due to the ongoing US government shutdown or new generic listing standards, which would render the 19b-4 deadline irrelevant.

Multiple Solana (SOL) ETF filings from Grayscale, VanEck, 21Shares and Bitwise are facing a decision by Oct. 10.

Later in the month, XRP (XRP) ETF filings from Grayscale, WisdomTree, Bitwise and CoinShares are awaiting feedback between Oct. 19 and 24.

Lastly, Grayscale's Dogecoin (DOGE) ETF and Cardano (ADA) ETF are both expected to receive a final decision before the end of October.

History could be in the making for Bitcoin (BTC) Layer-2s as Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), the fastest in development, has already secured $20.4M in presale funding.

Fresh off surpassing the $19M milestone earlier in the week, Bitcoin Hyper quickly attracted another $1.2M in just three days. Multiple whale purchases have again been key drivers, pushing the project's funding to its latest total.

With smart money already moving in, this scale of capital shows Bitcoin Hyper is shaping up to deliver what many expect to be the ultimate convergence of Solana-grade efficiency with Bitcoin's security.

At the current pace, the presale could potentially reach the $21M mark before the end of the week. 

Currently, investors have the opportunity to join the round at $0.013035 per HYPER, but only for the next 33 hours, before the price increases in the next stage.

The time-tested reputation of “Uptober” isn't letting bulls down, with Bitcoin pushing back to the $120,000 mark – a level not seen since mid-August, when it notched its all-time high at $124,128.

BTC has now logged two consecutive days in the green and appears poised for a third, fueling broader optimism across the market. That same wave of bullishness is spilling into Bitcoin Hyper, where early investors view the project not only as a breakthrough Layer-2 but also as a potential demand driver for BTC itself.

Bitcoin Hyper is building an ecosystem that combines the strongest features of blockchain: Solana's transaction speed and cost efficiency, paired with Bitcoin's decentralization and security. 

https://twitter.com/BTC_Hyper2/status/1971583436457750549

Under the hood, it relies on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to provide developers with parallelized execution and familiar Rust-based tools, making it possible to build high-performance dApps without sacrificing Bitcoin's settlement guarantees.

If Bitcoin can already reach $124,000 purely as a store of value, the introduction of Bitcoin Hyper – with BTC flowing into its canonical bridge and wrapped BTC circulating freely within its ecosystem – could unlock a far greater trajectory for the asset.

The week isn't even over, and Bitcoin Hyper has already drawn massive capital inflows to its presale, led by aggressive whale accumulation. 

On Monday, one whale made three separate purchases totaling 24.6M HYPER tokens worth $327,000.

By Thursday, others had joined in. Two more whales scooped up a combined 25.65M HYPER – one accumulating 10.81M tokens for $140,000, while the other collected 14.84M tokens for $193,000.

Such moves are often seen as savvy investments – whales or even institutions deploying significant capital into assets they believe have long-term potential. 

With access to deeper data, sharper analysis, and larger resources, these players are often ahead of the curve, which is why retail investors frequently view their activity as a valuable signal.

Smart money piling into Bitcoin Hyper shows additional conviction that the project could become a true driver of new Bitcoin demand and a leading force in the Layer-2 landscape.

Beyond gaining exposure to Bitcoin's fastest Layer-2 and the demand it could drive for BTC itself, investors are also looking at HYPER as their chance to get in early on what could feel like redemption for missing Bitcoin's early days.

BTC remains one of the most remarkable investments in history – from around $0.05 in 2010 to $120,000 today, a gain of nearly 240,000,000% that changed countless fortunes. Yet not everyone had the opportunity to ride that ship, which is why many now look for projects that could replicate even a fraction of that trajectory.

HYPER represents both Bitcoin's roots and its evolution. Wrapped BTC will serve as the medium of exchange within applications, but it is HYPER that powers the system – facilitating payments for transactions, staking, and governance. 

Without HYPER, the entire Solana-plus-Bitcoin model would stall, making it indispensable to the network's function and growth.

That's why many see HYPER as more than just another token. It's the key to unlocking a new demand avenue for Bitcoin, and one of the most respected crypto outlets, 99Bitcoins, has already projected it as a potential 100x token.

The smart money moves already tell the story, and more could flow in over the coming days as the presale heats up, with $20 million expected to be reached before the end of the week.

To be part of Bitcoin's biggest Layer-2, investors can purchase HYPER directly through the Bitcoin Hyper website using SOL, ETH, USDT, USDC, BNB, or even a credit card. 

You can also grow your HYPER holdings immediately by staking through the project's native protocol, which currently offers a 59% APY.

Bitcoin Hyper recommends Best Wallet – one of the best crypto wallets in the market – where HYPER is already listed under its lauded new project screening tool Upcoming Tokens, which makes it easy to buy, track, and claim once live.

The payments industry is undergoing a transformative shift with innovative players from outside the banking sector introducing solutions that make transactions faster and more convenient. While these private-sector advancements are valuable, the continued evolution of public money is essential to ensure reliability in an increasingly digital world. By introducing a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), central banks can reinforce their role as the issuers of sovereign money and provide a secure and inclusive solution, strengthening payment resilience and ensuring monetary sovereignty.
According to OMFIF and G+D's latest report CBDCs: It's Time for Action, 72% of central banks plan to issue a CBDC, with almost the half (46%) expecting to do so within the next one to five years. Yet, despite this growing momentum, some central banks have delayed their CBDC issuance timelines due to a range of regulatory, economic and political challenges.
What's holding central banks back?
While significant strides have already been made in addressing the technical requirements for CBDCs, including interoperability, cybersecurity and offline payment capabilities, timeframes involved in establishing legal frameworks to govern CBDCs are challenging. Bringing this type of legislation to fruition partially relies on political will, rather than the technical capacity of the bank or policy decision-making. Inflation spikes, debt issues and other urgent economic factors have also taken the focus away from CBDC development, alongside public misunderstandings around data use.
CBDCs present a promising solution to the major challenges that modern-day financial systems are currently facing, as well as a shift towards a tokenised monetary architecture. Wholesale CBDCs (wCBDCs) are a tokenised form of central bank reserves that represent a significant evolution in financial market infrastructure. They enable settlement processes that are quicker, safer and programmable across traditional and tokenised asset classes. They also bring together public and private currencies in one secure framework, ultimately becoming a monetary backbone in a tokenised ecosytem. Retail CBDCs benefit from the infrastructure and standards established by wCBDCs , gaining a solid foundation for more resilient, inclusive and private digital payments.
With offline functionality, CBDCs can provide users with a level of privacy similar to cash. But above all, offline capability keeps payments flowing during outages or natural disasters or make payments accessible in remote areas without or with only intermittent access to internet connectivity. For central banks, this helps them to maintain continuity during disruptions, and enhance trust.
What CBDCs need to succeed
To succeed with a CBDC deployment, central banks must first collaborate with other stakeholders, helping to ensure alignment between public and private sectors. In reality, a CBDC model is a two-tier system where central banks build the underlying platform and the private sector, primarily commercial banks, are the customer-facing part distributing CBDC and providing services and products to end-users, similar to cash.
CBDCs should integrate seamlessly into existing infrastructures, including financial IT systems and cash management platforms. Standardised interfaces and modular software components make it easier for commercial banks and fintech companies to bring digital currency into their operations and create applications in e-commerce and other sectors.
By enhancing interoperability and integration across digital assets – including stablecoins, tokenised deposits and other financial instruments – CBDCs can support the development of a unified and efficient financial ecosystem.
Pilot schemes can help address these challenges, and by conducting more feasibility studies, including user and merchant consultations, central banks can identify viable use cases and improve their understanding of the market's needs before deployment. This will help to foster adoption.
In an era increasingly dominated by digital transactions, ensuring the resilience of digital payment systems is critical. Particularly for CBDC, an offline capability emerges as a pivotal feature, serving as a trusted digital equivalent of cash.
Clear communication with the public is also important. 82% of central banks recognise the importance of CBDC privacy, but misconceptions persist about how citizen data is used, despite the fact that central banks do not have access to any sensitive information. Well-designed CBDCs can offer an enhanced data privacy and security level compared to existing payment options as it enables a separation of operational, transactional and administrative processes.
Governments can also play a key role in accelerating a CBDC deployment project by working closely with the central bank to address regulatory gaps and enable timely implementation.
Realising the CBDC opportunity 
CBDCs offer improved financial access, greater payment system resilience and the ability to reinforce monetary sovereignty in a digitised world. An effective CBDC deployment can bring services to underserved areas, such as remote regions with limited internet connectivity. To turn a CBDC into reality, barriers such as regulatory uncertainty, shifting political priorities, economic headwinds and lingering public misconceptions need to be addressed.
However, with the right approach and a greater emphasis on collaboration, communication and purpose-driven design, there is a positive route forward. This means developing legal frameworks with governments to speed up the deployment process, while also building public trust through clear messaging about privacy and data use. Just as importantly, CBDCs must be designed to solve real-world problems that reflect local priorities and offer the same convenience as the payment methods people already rely on. Taken together, these steps can help CBDCs gain the momentum needed for widespread adoption.

SWIFT, the global financial messaging network connecting more than 11,500 institutions in 200 countries, is set to develop a shared blockchain platform that will function as a common digital ledger for banks around the world. This infrastructure will enable seamless, real-time international payments and transfers and transactions with stablecoins and digital assets. BBVA has joined a consortium of more than 30 partner banks now starting work on a prototype.

The new network will function as a shared, secure digital ledger where banks can record their international transactions in real time, sorting and validating them through smart contracts. Thus, payments made through SWIFT's blockchain will be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with lower costs and without intermediaries. In addition, it will support transactions with stablecoins and tokenized financial assets (digitally represented money, bonds, or deposits), which can be transferred between blockchain networks instantly, securely, and traceably.

SWIFT is working on the prototype in collaboration with Consensys, a company specializing in blockchain solutions. Next steps involve developing and testing use cases to assess how this technology can be integrated into the global financial system. BBVA will provide the consortium with its expertise in digital innovation and global services to validate use cases such as business-to-business payments, international remittances, and asset settlement.

Eva Rubio, Head of Global Transaction Banking at BBVA Corporate & Investment Banking, said: “SWIFT's digital ledger initiative is a game-changer for the future of crossborder payments. The ability to settle regulated value in real time, with the reliability and security that the industry expects from SWIFT,  will unlock new efficiencies and opportunities for our clients. At BBVA, we are committed to collaborating on this next chapter of financial innovation to deliver the speed, transparency and resilience that businesses and consumers need in a digital world.”

The goal is to move toward a financial system in which international financial transactions are as agile and secure as local transactions. The platform will be interoperable and able to connect with current and future financial networks under the governance and regulatory compliance standards with which SWIFT operates.

The new system will enable financial institutions to securely offer:

The Ethereum price has once again crossed the $4,500 threshold, trading just 9% below its all-time high of $4,946, prompting a surge of bullish predictions for the leading altcoin. 

Bullish Reversal For Ethereum Price

Market expert Gert van Lagen took to X (formerly Twitter) to share his insights, suggesting that the Ethereum price is currently following a “textbook” expanding diagonal pattern on its biweekly chart.

As seen in the expert's chart below, this expanding diagonal pattern is characterized by a series of rising trend lines, indicating a potential reversal from a downtrend to an uptrend. 

Over the past month and a half, the Ethereum price has consolidated between $4,200 and $4,600, with a brief drop towards $3,800 on September 25th. This met significant demand, resulting in a swift recovery of the $4,000 support level. 

By connecting the lower points of these downward movements—known as waves 2 and 4—with the upper points of waves 1, 3, and 5, a triangular or diagonal shape emerges. 

According to van Lagen's analysis, this pattern signifies a shift in momentum for the Ethereum price from bearish to bullish, often leading to a significant upward breakout. Bitcoin (BTC) led the market recovery also approaching record levels above $120,000.

Van Lagen noted that Ethereum's Wave v is nearing completion, supported by a final corrective a-b-c wave. Specifically, Wave a has successfully broken above the crucial resistance level of $3,650, retested it for support in the b wave, and is now poised for the final impulse in wave c, aiming for an ambitious target range of $9,000 to $18,000.

The Path Forward For ETH

Adding to the optimistic sentiment, market analyst Mr. Wall Street has expressed a similarly bullish outlook, asserting that the Ethereum price is on track to reach its final price target for this cycle, estimated between $7,000 and $8,000. 

However, both analysts agree that Ethereum's ability to surpass its previous record near the $5,000 mark will be pivotal as this level is expected to act as a significant resistance barrier should the current recovery continue.

Looking ahead, market analyst Michael van de Poppe has also weighed in, predicting that the coming weeks will see Bitcoin experience an upward bounce before undergoing a slight correction. 

Following this, he anticipates the Ethereum price will begin to gain momentum. “Given that the BTC pair is currently holding up well and has undergone a standard correction, I believe we will see Ethereum pick up steam in the near future,” van de Poppe stated.

Science reveals how we see the world differently through a moving camera.

Here's what you'll learn in this story:

Few people could make sense of it: a video played at a recent Congressional hearing concerning “unidentified anomalous phenomena,” or UAP, seems to show a U.S. military missile bouncing off a mysterious orb in mid-air. The blurry and short clip, appearing as if filmed from a point above the intersecting objects, was released at a House Oversight transparency hearing on Sept. 9. It attracted national attention, but what many people thought they saw was an illusion.

So, what was it, really?

A U.S. Army spokesperson said in an email that while the hearing and video are in the public record, the newly renamed Department of War “has not authenticated the video, or issued a substantive confirmation about the event. Press reports reflect no Pentagon verification.”

So we asked a missile physics expert for some help. Fred Lamb, PhD, a theoretical astrophysicist at the University of Illinois, chaired a ballistic missile report earlier this year for the American Physical Society. He cautioned by e-mail that any analysis requires “many, many assumptions” for experts such as himself who have “no independent knowledge of the event,” but said he would do his best proceeding on assumptions.

Lamb's conclusion—based on the evidence below—was that the object was likely a high-altitude balloon being cut up mid-air by a special variant of a U.S. missile designed to eject blades. He emphasized that this type of missile strike is not what the public would expect to see from watching Hollywood movies or TV series of ballistic explosions. “The main reason for this is to make the movie or TV event loud, dramatic, and exciting—not because that is what the destruction of a target, such as a balloon, would look like in reality,” he said.

Press reports from the hearing suggested that the event occurred in the air near Yemen and involved a variant of the 100-pound-scale “Hellfire” missile. Generally speaking, the U.S. Army uses these AGM-114 missiles, the spokesperson said—primarily a laser-guided variant called “Romeo” for its serial number, AGM-114R.

But there are at least 10 variants of Hellfire, Lamb said. His video analysis assumes one of these variants was fired from an MQ-9 Reaper drone, based on media reports, and that the camera that took the footage was flying on a second drone far above, using a “very high magnification thermal imaging camera,” he said. This drone type has a reported operational altitude of 25,000 feet, a little lower than typical commercial airliner flight routes, he said.

Lamb named the altitude and the camera specifically to highlight all the uncertainties the public is working with: the distance from the camera to the background, what the background is (might be ocean or cloud cover), the path of the presumed missile, the distance from the camera to the target, and the direction the camera is pointing towards (relative to the ground.)

“We don't know any of these things,” he emphasized, which means an untrained observer might make conclusions, such as assuming “that the missile and the target are both moving in the same plane,” or “that the camera is not rotating,” among other misperceptions.

So we can't say what we are looking at for sure.

However, Lamb said one possibility is that the camera is zooming far down to the intersecting objects, creating an optical illusion known as “parallax motion.” In a restricted field of view such as a camera lens, the target may be appearing to move very quickly—and that would especially be the case when there are few background objects with which to judge the motion.

Other UAPs that have appeared to be moving very rapidly have been found to be moving not under their own volition, but only because a wind was pushing them along, Lamb said. He therefore suggested it is plausible—but not a slam dunk—that the “target” might be a balloon high in the air reflecting sunlight, which “appears to be moving rapidly mostly because of ‘parallax motion,' but also because it is being carried along by a high-altitude wind.”

Assuming it is a balloon, who makes the decision to fire on the object? When asked if it is a pilot, a commanding officer or somebody else, the U.S. Army said it was unable to release that information “due to operational considerations.” Lamb added that generally, “There are many possible reasons why the U.S. military might want to bring down a balloon that was floating in an area where a conflict is ongoing.”

Assuming the missile hit a balloon, the video shows what appears to be a number of pieces—flying away in parallel—after the missile strike. “The missile continues on its way, indicating that the missile was not significantly deflected by its interaction with the target,” Lamb added of what he could plausibly see. “This indicates that there was not much interaction, and/or that the mass of the target was small, consistent with the target being a balloon.”

More evidence for the target being a balloon includes “the fact that once the target is intersected, the resulting pieces of the target move apart slowly, as they would if they are drifting apart while continuing to be carried by a wind.” The camera's optics, he noted, likely couldn't pick up all the debris—what was visible were pieces that “all seem to have the same noncircular shapes and the same orientation.”

As for why the missile continued and did not appear to explode? Lamb said there are a couple of possibilities. Perhaps the Hellfire's warhead did not detonate. Or more likely, it is a “type of Hellfire missile that … did not have a substantial explosive warhead—but could nevertheless cut or tear the balloon.” The most likely example would be the AGM-114R9X, he added, which pops out sharp blades with only a small amount of explosive.

Hellfire missiles have been used in multiple operations and by different branches of the military, according to the U.S. Army. They were deployed during the 1991 Gulf War operations—also known as “Desert Storm” in the U.S., and continue to be used through the ongoing “War on Terror.” Hellfire missiles have been launched from both drones and helicopters.

While the nature of the video means we cannot know if a Hellfire missile was ripping up a balloon—or draw any detailed conclusions about what was shown—it's an opportunity for all of us to realize that sometimes, what we think we're seeing in a visual recording may not be what's actually in front of us.

The method involves stitching together many thin “slices” of light reflecting off an object.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Earlier this year, researchers in Austria were able to put on display an effect of special relativity that's been theorized for 100 years. It's called the Terrell-Penrose effect—also known as Terrell rotation, or the Lampa-Terrell-Penrose effect—and it describes the idea that when an object is traveling at the speed of light, any method of trying to photograph that object will show it to be slightly rotated. To recreate this effect in an experiment, scientists from Vienna Center for Quantum Science and Technology (TU Wien) and the University of Vienna combined lasers and high-speed photography to turn light speed into something we can witness up close. The results appear in the peer-reviewed journal Communications Physics.

In the paper, the team—led by corresponding author Dominik Hornof and senior author Peter Schattschneider—explains how physicist Anton Lampa first theorized about these photographic phenomena in 1924. Lampa, who himself studied and taught at the University of Vienna, wrote about what he believed would happen to the appearance of a rod as it approached the cosmic speed limit.

35 years later, physicists Roger Penrose and Nelson James Terrell separately had the same further insight: a photograph would capture the way the object would appear not condensed (as one might expect), but rotated. In other words, you would go from seeing one face of a cube to seeing two sides and the corner they formed, instead of one distorted single face.

“If you wanted to take a picture of the rocket as it flew past, you would have to take into account that the light from different points took different lengths of time to reach the camera,” Schattschneider explained in a TU Wien statement. “This makes it look to us as if the cube had been rotated.”

But the speed of light is 299,792,458 meters per second. Our best particle accelerators—like those at CERN or Fermilab—can get close enough, but for various reasons, we can't photograph those particles the right way or observe their shape. Instead, the TU Wien team seemed to take a cue from the iPhone's panoramic mode: What if they sliced an object into micro-thin segments to photograph, then assembled the slices into a composite?

To “slice” the object, they used a setup similar to something we usually don't want: the blinding reflection of bright light. In our homes or cars, we shift to avoid the worst of these reflections, but they're exactly what you want when microphotographing light itself. “We illuminate the object with a pulsed laser and take a photo after a certain delay time. Light reflected from parts of the object that correspond to the respective optical path length will appear bright in this photo,” the team wrote.

Using this approach, the team was able to effectively shorten the speed of light to about 2 meters per second. That's like stitching together nearly 150 million photos of your trip to the Grand Canyon. “We combined the still images into short video clips of the ultra-fast objects. The result was exactly what we expected,” Schattschneider said in the statement. “A cube appears twisted, a sphere remains a sphere, but the North Pole is in a different place.”

The team concludes that the same experimental setup—or something iterating on the same ideas—could be used to study other observations about special relativity. In the meantime, make sure to point your good sides (plural) toward the camera when you're traveling at light speed.

Nomads who created these monumental images had apparently found a way to survive the arid conditions of the desert, and they left behind images that showed the way to water for those who came after.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

In the Nefud desert of Saudi Arabia, a caravan of camels—alongside ibex, gazelles, aurochs, and the equid ancestors of horses—forever marches beneath the scorching Sun. But these animals will never reach the lake oasis they are so eager to drink from, as they are all etched in stone. 

The etchings are evidence of a nomadic people who were somehow able to survive in the punishing heat of northern Arabia 11,700 years ago, towards the end of the last ice age. This was a particularly dry period that offered little relief, save for the winter rains. During the transition between the Pleistocene and Holocene periods, it is possible that pre-agricultural nomadic groups followed camels on their migration routes across the parched landscape towards lakes that arose seasonally as the heat relented and rain fell. 

Archaeologists Maria Guagnin (from the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology) and Ceri Shipton (from the Institute of Archaeology at University College London) had not been expecting to make this discovery when they were excavating the site of Jebel Misma in 2023. But when one of Shipton's assistants looked up and shouted jamal (“camel” in Arabic), she noticed something extraordinary. As the morning Sun rose above rock walls a hundred feet high, it brought to light etchings of life-sized camels and other animals on the move. 

“The primary aim of this research was to test if the rock art panels and archaeological deposits represent earlier occupations during the Holocene humid period, resulting in a condensed chronology of rock art production, or if they belong to earlier periods and represent a longer period of human presence in northern Arabia,” she and Guagnin said in a study recently published in the journal Nature Communications.

The etchings were visible for about an hour and a half, then seemed to vanish as the sun soared higher. Shipton and Guagnin were awestruck, realizing that the Pleistocene and early Holocene artists who depicted these creatures in stone would have had to find a foothold somewhere on the sheer sandstone wall and draw everything right in front of them without being able to see the entire picture until they climbed down. There are also several layers of etchings, with some earlier depictions that appeared to have been reinforced.

Jebel Misma was not the only site with these monumental images. The site of Jebel Arnaan was the most impressive, featuring more equids, ibex, gazelles, aurochs, and even a few humans among them. Later etchings are sometimes superimposed on earlier ones by artists who passed through this region. Some of the animals appear more natural, while others show exaggerated features.  Similar art was found at the Jebel Mleiha site. Stone tools found at Jebel Arnaan were luminescence and radiocarbon dated to the Pleistocene-Holocene transition.

What these drawings can tell us is that nomads allowed wild animals to lead them to water via seasonal migration routes. The etchings may have been intended to mark these routes. Though winter is the rainy season in Saudi Arabia (which can also be inferred by the heavier coats of the camels), it is also mating season (evidenced by how males' necks were swollen from mating vocalizations). The presence of an aurochs might indicate water, since these animals needed more of it than most. Locations of drawings also suggest that humans and animals followed a gulley up a slope where even today, rainwater forms ephemeral pools.

“The engravings, which may have been created over a time span of millennia, would have reminded people of ancient symbolisms and beliefs of their group, which likely structured their highly seasonal lives and thus enhanced their ability to thrive in these marginal landscapes,” the researchers said.

Thousands of years ago, the nomadic peoples of Saudi Arabia may not have had corps or livestock yet, but they survived by trusting the instinct of animals who knew how to survive a drought. It seems one thing was certain in harsh conditions: When in doubt, follow the camels.

John Gilpatrick and Andrew Daniels discuss how your consciousness may be jumping through time.

Ever get that weird feeling where you just know something's going to happen? Turns out, science might actually have an explanation for it. And it's weirder than anything you've seen in a sci-fi movie.

In one of Pop Mech's most-read stories of the year, “Your Consciousness Can Jump Through Time—Meaning ‘Gut Feelings' Are Memories From the Future, Scientists Say,” researchers explore the idea that what we've long dismissed as a gut feeling or coincidence might be called “precognition,” which is when your brain remembers an event before it's happened. 

Some scientists now believe consciousness doesn't necessarily follow a linear timeline, and that it may be possible to entangle with your own future memories.

Watch Pop Mech's John Gilpatrick and Andrew Daniels dig into the wild world of time-slipping minds, including a landmark 1990s study that made scientists start to take precognition seriously. They break down quantum theories, reveal why the CIA got involved in precognition research, and wrestle with the possibility that time just might not work the way we think it does.

John and Andrew also discuss why your brain may be more like a walkie-talkie to your future self, and what that means for déjà vu, free will, and the fabric of reality itself. You know, totally normal stuff.

Highlights:

Long-term exposure to the industrial solvent trichloroethylene (TCE) outdoors may be linked to an increased risk of Parkinson's disease, according to a large nationwide study published in the October 1, 2025, issue of Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.

Trichloroethylene is a chemical used in metal degreasing, dry cleaning and other industrial applications. Although TCE has been banned for certain uses, it remains in use today as an industrial solvent and is a persistent environmental pollutant in air, water and soil across the United States. The study does not prove that TCE exposure causes Parkinson's disease, it only shows an association.

"In this nationwide study of older adults, long-term exposure to trichloroethylene in outdoor air was associated with a small but measurable increase in Parkinson's risk," said study author Brittany Krzyzanowski, PhD, of Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix. "These findings add to a growing body of evidence that environmental exposures may contribute to Parkinson's disease."

Researchers used Medicare data to identify people over age 67 newly diagnosed with Parkinson's between 2016 and 2018. Each person was compared with five people who did not have the disease. After removing people without home ZIP+4 information, the study included 221,789 people with Parkinson's and over 1.1 million people without the disease.

They mapped exposure to outdoor TCE concentrations using U.S. Environmental Protection Agency data and participants' residential neighborhood based on their ZIP +4 location. Air levels of TCE were estimated by U.S. Census tract, a small area within a county. Each participant's exposure was based on their neighborhood two years prior to diagnosis.

Researchers divided participants into 10 groups based on their estimated TCE exposure. Those in the lowest exposure group experienced levels between 0.005 and 0.01 micrograms per cubic meter (μg/m³), while those in the highest group had exposures ranging from 0.14 to 8.66 μg/m³.

After adjusting for other factors that could affect the risk of Parkinson's, including age, smoking history and exposure to fine particulate air pollution, researchers found people exposed to the highest outdoor TCE levels had a 10% increased risk of Parkinson's disease compared to people exposed to the lowest levels.

The researchers also identified several geographic "hot spots" where outdoor TCE levels were highest, particularly in the Rust Belt region of the U.S. and smaller pockets across the country. They then analyzed Parkinson's risk in the 10 miles surrounding the three top TCE-emitting facilities in the U.S. from 2002. For two of the areas, risk was higher closer to the facilities, and at one of those sites, there was a clear increasing incremental risk the closer people lived to the facility.

"While the increased risk was modest, the sheer number of people exposed to TCE in the environment means the potential public health impact could be substantial," said Krzyzanowski. "This underscores the need for stronger regulations and more monitoring of industrial pollutants."

A limitation of the study is that it focused only on Medicare-aged individuals, so findings may not apply to younger people or those with early-onset Parkinson's disease. In addition, TCE exposure estimates were based on outdoor air levels in 2002 and may not reflect individual lifetime or indoor exposures.

The study was supported by the U.S. Department of Defense, the Kemper and Ethel Marley Foundation, Barrow Neurological Foundation and the Moreno Family Foundation.

In what experts are calling a paradigm-shifting landmark study, scientists from The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center - Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute (OSUCCC - James) report key findings about the underlying mechanisms of immune system stress response to protein misfolding, launching a new approach to cancer immunotherapy treatment targeting the protein production cycle.

For this study, OSUCCC - James researchers sought to answer a long-held question: Why do T cells, which are crucial for fighting infections and recognizing cancer, sometimes become "exhausted" and lose their effectiveness?

In this comprehensive preclinical study, researchers revealed a hidden vulnerability in exhausted T cells: they are overwhelmed by misfolded proteins that ignite a previously unrecognized stress pathway, now named TexPSR (proteotoxic stress response in T-cell exhaustion).

Unlike ordinary stress responses that slow protein production to help cells regain balance, TexPSR drives protein synthesis into overdrive. The result is a relentless buildup of misfolded proteins, stress granules, and toxic aggregates ¾ similar to the amyloid plaques seen in Alzheimer's disease. This overload poisons the T cells, crippling their ability to attack tumors.

Nature Reviews Immunology, a leading opinion journal in the field, described this phenomenon as a "proteotoxic shock." Strikingly, when researchers blocked key drivers of TexPSR in preclinical models, exhausted T cells recovered their function and cancer immunotherapy became markedly more effective.

"T-cell exhaustion is the biggest roadblock to cancer immunotherapy. Our study results present a surprising and exciting answer to this fundamental problem and could be critical to improving future scientific advances in the field of engineered cancer drug therapies to harness the immune system," said Zihai Li, MD, PhD, senior study author and founding director of the Pelotonia Institute for Immuno-oncology (PIIO) at the OSUCCC - James.

Li, who also serves as Deputy Director for Translational Research at the OSUCCC - James and holds the Klotz Memorial Chair in Cancer Research, has studied the link between protein folding and immunity for over three decades. He emphasized: "Researchers worldwide are tackling T-cell exhaustion through studying genetics, epigenetics, metabolism and others, but the role of protein quality control has been largely overlooked -- until now."

The Ohio State cancer research team also found that high levels of TexPSR in T cells from cancer patients were linked to poor clinical responses to immunotherapy. This suggests that targeting TexPSR could be a new way to enhance cancer treatment in the clinics.

"When T cells become exhausted, they continue creating molecular weapons but then destroy the weapons before they can do their job," said Yi Wang, first author and doctoral student in Li's laboratory.

The team's findings reveal that this self-perpetuating cycle of protein stress is a central driver of T-cell exhaustion, ultimately disabling the function of these immune cells. Notably, the mechanism was validated in multiple preclinical and clinical cancer models -- including lung, bladder, liver cancer, and leukemia -- highlighting its broad relevance across diverse cancer types.

Li and colleagues report their findings in the latest issue of Nature.

Researchers converted a kidney with type-A blood to type-O.Credit: Sherry Yates Young/Science Photo Library

Scientists have converted the blood type of a donor kidney and transplanted the organ into a person. The procedure — the first of its kind — could improve access to donor organs, specialists say, because the blood type of the donor would no longer matter.

Currently, organs from deceased donors can be transplanted into people only if they have a compatible blood type. This is because the recipient's immune system can produce antibodies to attack and destroy the donated organ if the donor and recipient have different antigens, which come in two types: A and B. Organs that are blood type O do not have A or B antigens, so anyone can receive them.

Researchers from Canada and China used an enzyme to remove type-A antigens from a donor kidney1. The enzyme converts type-A blood into type-O, says study author Stephen Withers, a chemist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. The type-O kidney was then transplanted into a 68-year-old brain-dead man in Chongqing, China. The organ remained healthy for two days before showing signs of rejection. It produced urine for six days. The results are published in Nature Biomedical Engineering today.

The enzyme was first identified in 2019 by some members of the same team2. In 2022, they showed that a type-A lung could be converted into a type-O one3, although the organ wasn't transplanted into a person.

The results are groundbreaking, says Natasha Rogers, a transplant clinician at Westmead Hospital in Sydney, Australia. They could improve access to donor organs and reduce transplant wait lists. If the blood type of the organ was no longer a barrier for transplantation, physicians could focus on things such as matching other antigens unrelated to blood type, which are important in terms of how long a transplant will last, she adds

The world is built with concrete. Could it one day be powered by it?

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Concrete has a long history of innovation, dating back to 6500 B.C.E. Although most of this material breakthroughs through millennia have been related to durability—the Romans were particularly gifted at making concrete that lasts—in recent years, concrete has become an innovation platform for solving some of the world's most pressing problems. 

Scientists have developed concrete with self-healing abilities, concrete that acts as a kind of carbon sink, and concrete that can even increase crop yields. Now scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have improved upon a radical new innovation—battery concrete. A new study published in the journal PNAS details how a mixture of cement, water, ultra-fine carbon black (filled with nanoscale particles), and electrolytes can form what they call an “electron-conducting carbon concrete,” or ec3, which creates a conductive nanonetwork that can act like a battery.

“A key to the sustainability of concrete is the development of ‘multifunctional concrete,' which integrates functionalities like this energy storage, self-healing, and carbon sequestration,” Admir Masic, lead author of the study from MIT, said in a press statement. “Concrete is already the world's most-used construction material, so why not take advantage of that scale to create other benefits?”

This isn't the first attempt to imbue concrete with electrifying capabilities. In 2023, self-heating concrete slabs were placed in Odori Park in Sapporo, Japan, which receives nearly 200 inches of snow per year. In this new study, MIT scientists 3D-imaged the nanoscale structure to understand its composition while optimizing electrolytes used in the concrete itself. The team found that the best performance was brought about by adding organic electrolytes (using quaternary ammonium salts with acetonitrile) directly into the mixing water, which allowed the researchers to create thicker electrodes that stored more energy. The team estimates that a refrigerator-sized chunk of ec3 can store up to 2 kilowatt-hours of energy. 

“The Ancient Romans made great advances in concrete construction. Massive structures like the Pantheon stand to this day without reinforcement,” Masic said in a press statement. “If we keep up their spirit of combining material science with architectural vision, we could be at the brink of a new architectural revolution with multifunctional concretes like ec3.”

Continuing with this Roman theme, the researchers also created a miniature arch to test how structure and energy storage could go hand-in-hand. The structure operated at 9 volts, supported its own weight, and powered an LED light. Interestingly, the light flickered as the structure experienced stress—while that isn't exactly great for illuminating vast spaces like the Pantheon, it could be immensely valuable as a diagnostic tool. “We may be able to use this as a signal of when and to what extent a structure is stressed, or monitor its overall health in real time,” Masic said in a press statement. 

Of course, the most compelling use case for these new concrete batteries is for green energy storage. Although green energy production has exploded in the past few decades, storing all of that energy remains a challenge. The ubiquity of concrete throughout cities and suburbs could help address the storage shortfalls.  

“What excites us most is that we've taken a material as ancient as concrete and shown that it can do something entirely new,” James Weaver, a co-author of the study from MIT, said in a press statement. “By combining modern nanoscience with an ancient building block of civilization, we're opening a door to infrastructure that doesn't just support our lives, it powers them.”

Metrics details

Genetic studies of human metabolism have been limited in scale and allelic breadth. Here we provide a data-driven map of the genetic regulation of circulating small molecules and lipoprotein characteristics (249 traits) measured using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy across the allele frequency spectrum in ~450,000 individuals. Trans-ancestral meta-analyses identify 29,824 locus–metabolite associations mapping to 753 regions with effects largely consistent between men and women and large ancestral groups represented in UK Biobank. We observe and classify extreme genetic pleiotropy, identify regulators of lipid metabolism, and assign effector genes at >100 loci through rare-to-common allelic series. We propose roles for genes less established in metabolic control (for example, SIDT2), genes characterized by phenotypic heterogeneity (for example, APOA1) and genes with specific disease relevance (for example, VEGFA). Our study demonstrates the value of broad, large-scale metabolomic phenotyping to identify and characterize regulators of human metabolism.

Our understanding of human metabolism is mostly based on dedicated hypothesis testing in experimental settings, informed by model organisms or observations in patients with rare diseases. Only recently has high-throughput profiling of small molecules in large-scale studies enabled systematic testing of genetic variation across the genome and provided an agnostic approach for discovering genes that encode key metabolic regulators1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. These efforts have provided important new insights into how genetic variation shapes human chemical and metabolic individuality1 and have corroborated a large body of biochemical knowledge1,2,10,12.

The importance of such genome–metabolome-wide association studies (mGWAS) extends beyond the mapping of biochemical pathways, sometimes demonstrating almost immediate clinical value. They provided examples of how readily available supplementation strategies may prevent disease or delay onset in high-risk individuals, such as serine for macular telangiectasia type 2, a rare eye disorder2. They further identified unknown variants that affect the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of exogenous compounds, most importantly drugs1,13, thereby providing pathways to mitigate adverse drug effects. However, there are several challenges that currently limit the potential of mGWAS analyses, particularly for causal inference. These include (1) the still rather small number of, at most, a dozen genetic variants linked to single molecules, (2) the inability to distinguish whether pleiotropic variants act on different molecules or pathways independently (horizontal pleiotropy), or whether they serve as ‘root causes' of successive downstream changes (vertical pleiotropy), (3) the difficulty in distinguishing between locus-specific and metabolite abundance effects when colocalization at disease-risk loci is observed1 and (4) the challenge of confidently assigning effector genes at newly identified loci.

Here, we integrated rare (based on whole exome sequencing) and common genetic variation with measures of 249 metabolic phenotypes, including small molecules and detailed lipoprotein characteristics, among >450,000 UK Biobank (UKB) participants representing three distinct ancestries. We demonstrate largely consistent genetic regulation across ancestries and sexes for almost 30,000 locus–metabolite associations and systematically categorize abundant genetic pleiotropy. By integrating machine-learning-derived effector gene assignments with rare exonic variation, we identify previously unknown regulators of metabolism and observe heterogeneity in association profiles for variants mapping to the same gene. Finally, we demonstrate how systematic integration of statistical colocalization and Mendelian randomization can identify pathways with the potential to mitigate cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk beyond current approaches focused primarily on lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.

We integrated genome-wide association studies (GWAS; population-specific minor allele frequency (MAF) ≥0.5%) with rare exome-wide association studies (ExWAS; MAF ≤0.05%) on plasma concentrations of 249 metabolite phenotypes, quantified using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. We included up to 450,000 UKB participants across three major ancestries (British White European, EUR (n = 434,646); British African, BA (n = 6,573); British Central/South Asian, BSA (n = 8,796)) (Extended Data Fig. 1). The NMR measures comprised 14 lipoprotein subclasses and associated characteristics (that is, extra-large very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) to small high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles), along with small molecules such as amino acids and ketone bodies quantified in molar concentration units (Supplementary Table 1).

We identified 29,824 regional sentinel–NMR measure associations in trans-ancestral meta-analyses, representing 753 nonoverlapping genomic regions (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 2). Nearly half of these regions (n = 359, 47%) associated with more than ten NMR measures, demonstrating considerable pleiotropy. Characteristics of large HDL particles, such as particle size and lipid composition, were associated with the largest number of regions (median 166, interquartile range 126–195), compared with all NMR measures (median 105, interquartile range 68–142), findings that considerably extended previous work3 and replicated parallel efforts using UKB9 (Extended Data Fig. 2). Genes with well-characterized roles in human metabolism were significantly enriched across different significance bins (adjusted P values <4.24 × 10−9; Supplementary Fig. 1), suggesting that ever-larger studies of omnigenic traits, such as metabolites, still yield biological plausible findings.

Each row represents an NMR measure, colored for biochemical class. Chromosomal positions are shown on the x axis. P values are raw −log10(P value) from a two-sided Z test across effect estimates derived within three ancestral groups. b, Weighted average allele frequency compared with estimated effect size for trans-ancestral sentinel variants. Points are colored for biochemical classification. c, A comparison of effect sizes between British White European samples (x axis) and British African samples (y axis). We considered variants that were significant in either population. d, Similar to c but comparing British Central/South Asian samples. Dots are colored according to their absolute Z score in British White European samples.

We observed significant evidence of heterogeneity (P < 1 × 10−4) across ancestries for very few loci (n = 342; 1.14%), and ancestral-wise comparison of effect estimates demonstrated largely concordant effect estimates (Fig. 1c,d, Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 3). All sentinels seen in individuals of British African and British Central/South Asian ancestry were replicated in individuals of European ancestry, except for one locus that was specific to British Africans. The previously reported14 missense variant rs3211938 within CD36, which is common among individuals of African ancestry (MAFBA = 0.12) but absent among individuals of European ancestry (MAFEUR = 0.0), was significantly associated (P values <1.49 × 10−10) with lower plasma concentrations of omega 3 fatty acids and 15 other NMR measures, including lipoprotein particle characteristics. This is in line with the role of CD36 encoding for a fatty acid translocase, facilitating the recognition and uptake of long-chain fatty acids. We note that the sample sizes in the smaller ancestral groups did not permit comprehensive replication.

While we observed highly correlated effect sizes across female and male participants (median r = 0.98, range 0.90–0.99), we also identified 360 putative sex-differential loci for 239 NMR measures, representing 1,800 heterogenous associations in sex-stratified meta-analyses (heterogeneity P value <5 × 10−8), most of which (65.3%; n = 1,175 loci) could not be explained by confounding factors (Supplementary Note, Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 4). Putative sex-differential loci were generally directionally concordant between the sexes (Fig. 2a), in line with previous proteomics analyses and suggesting that significant sex interactions do not reflect sex-discordant effects15.

Per locus–trait combination, 205 lipid-related NMR traits were ranked based on their absolute effect size and compared with the NMR trait that corresponds the Lipids Genetics consortium trait. Pie charts show the percentage of loci where the corresponding NMR trait is ranked among the top 10% of associated traits. TC, total cholesterol; TG, triglycerides.

We next used a two-stage strategy to refine regional associations to a smaller number of candidate causal variants. We first identified 3,007 statistically independent metabolite quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) associated with one or more NMR measure, representing a total of 43,322 credible set–NMR measurement pairs (Supplementary Table 5). Lead fine-mapped mQTLs per NMR trait explained on average 6.9% (range 0.57–13.42%) of variance in plasma metabolite concentrations (Extended Data Fig. 4). Second, we leveraged the different linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure in British African and British Central/South Asian individuals to further refine 3,386 credible sets that contained >1 variant and with suggestive evidence in either ancestry, leading to an increase in the number of credible sets with high-confidence variants and decrease in mean credible set size from 9 to 4 variants (Supplementary Note and Supplementary Fig. 3). Trans-ancestral fine-mapping improved resolution in loci that did not resolve in individuals of European ancestry alone, but we note that the overall improvement was marginal. Instead of refining already tight credible sets, future studies should therefore focus on scaling discovery in non-European ancestries to identify unknown causal variants.

To assess the value of metabogenomic studies of 1H NMR-spectrometry-based lipoprotein profiling over standard clinical markers, we classified NMR metabolome association profiles for 1,657 genetic variants reported for commonly measured clinical markers (LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, total cholesterol and triglycerides) obtained in 1.6 million people16. Around 25% of associated variants had the corresponding NMR measure among the top 10% of the most strongly associated NMR measures, with 22.5% of genetic variants showing significantly stronger association with refined lipoprotein measures compared with their matching measure on the NMR platform, an observation most pronounced for non-HDL and LDL cholesterol concentrations (Fig. 2b). Relevant loci for lipoprotein metabolism can thus be discovered using readily available clinical measurements; however, refined lipoprotein profiles are necessary for better understanding the relevant biological pathways, including any inference about druggability or use for genetic causal inference methods. One such example was the PNPLA3 locus (tagged by rs3747207, associated with LDL cholesterol by the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium; β = −0.014, P = 2.3 × 10−21), where we observed no association with LDL cholesterol (β = −0.001, P = 0.49) but with LDL particle size (β = 0.045, P = 1.04 × 10−73), and multiple characteristics of extra-large VLDL particles (Extended Data Fig. 5). The intronic rs3747207 variant is in strong LD (r2 = 0.98) with the well-known missense variant rs738409 (p.Ile148Met) that has been demonstrated to confer hepatic lipid accumulation by altering ubiquitination of patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3)17. Our results provide human genetic support for a recently proposed role of PNPLA3 in the secretion of large VLDL particles18.

We successfully assigned effector genes for almost three-quarters of European ancestry fine-mapped mQTLs (73.6%; n = 2,213) with at least moderate confidence (candidate gene score ≥1.5, range 0–3), including about 28.2% with high-confidence assignments (score ≥2; n = 848), by training a machine learning model that integrates functional genomic resources with pathway information inspired by the ProGeM framework19 (Supplementary Table 6). For example, we prioritized the fatty acid elongase gene ELOVL6 for 16 different VLDL/HDL characteristics (tagged by rs3813829). The gene product, ELOVL fatty acid elongase 6, catalyzes the rate-limiting step in long-chain fatty acid elongation, which are subsequently incorporated into lipoprotein particles. We also prioritized genes with upstream roles in metabolism, including a locus on 17q25.3 where we prioritized cytohesin-1 (CYTH1) as the putative effector gene for 5 independent genetic variants linked to 11 distinct NMR measures mostly comprising characteristics of VLDL particles. CYTH1, previously associated with type 2 diabetes20, promotes activation of ADP-ribosylation factors (ARF)1, ARF5 and ARF6, regulators of lipid vesicle transport, membrane lipid composition and modification21, demonstrating a relevant but indirect link to lipoprotein metabolism.

We observed considerable overlap of machine-learning-guided effector gene predictions (top three genes) with those reported based on manually curated biological plausibility (191 out of 283 loci)3 or based on colocalization with protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) that have not been used to train the algorithm22 (81 out of 143; Supplementary Table 6). While missing overlap indicates room for improvement, 24 high-confidence assignments strongly disagreed with either external source (gene score > 2 but no match among pQTLs prioritized or manually curated ones). For example, we prioritized PEPD (score 2.42) as opposed to CEBPA3 for rs62102718. PEPD encodes peptidase D, which has been shown to promote adipose tissue fibrosis in mouse knock-out models promoting insulin resistance23. Insulin resistance, in turn, provides a very plausible explanation for the pleiotropic effect of the variant on diverse lipoprotein characteristics (n = 31).

Assigned effector genes were significantly enriched in different tissues, reflecting known and lesser-established organ contributions (Extended Data Fig. 6a and Supplementary Table 7). Genes characteristic of the liver, adipose tissue, adrenal gland and female breast tissue (probably reflecting its high adipose tissue content) were significantly enriched among effector gene sets across the metabolic measures captured by NMR. This included significant enrichment of all amino acids in liver tissue (for example, phenylalanine: odds ratio (OR) 14.8, P < 1.3 × 10−8, histidine: OR 7.9, P < 2.9 × 10−11) but also for skeletal muscle in alanine metabolism (OR 3.82; P < 7.9 × 10−9). Similar enrichments were observed when using the closest gene instead of our annotated effector genes for mQTLs (Extended Data Fig. 6b).

Pleiotropy is widespread but poorly understood. We developed a framework to characterize four different modes of metabolic pleiotropy (Fig. 3a–d, Extended Data Fig. 7, Supplementary Table 6 and Methods). About half of the pleiotropic mQTLs (n = 880; ≥2 NMR measures) showed evidence for two different modes of vertical pleiotropy. First, within confined pathways (n = 218; ‘pathway pleiotropy'; Fig. 3a) or, second, as a function of the correlation with the ‘lead' NMR measure (n = 662; ‘proportional pleiotropy'; Fig. 3b). A prototypical example for proportional pleiotropy was an mQTL tagged by rs624698 for which we prioritized ANGPTL3 as the likely effector gene (Fig. 3b). Angiopoietin-like 3, encoded by ANGPTL3, inhibits lipoprotein lipase activity but also endothelial lipase, resulting in increased triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and phospholipid concentrations, consistent with HDL-particle characteristics being the most strongly associated NMR measure (P < 1.0 × 10−546). Other associations reflected downstream effects on lipoprotein metabolism rather than acting on independent pathways (Fig. 3b), considerably expanding previous genetic observations24.

The colors indicate different modes of pleiotropy and correspond to the legend in e. For each plot, a linear regression fit (lines) with 95% confidence interval (bands) is given. Scatterplots in a–d represent examples of mQTLs classified as pathway pleiotropy (a), proportional pleiotropy (b), disproportional pleiotropy (c) and nonspecific pleiotropy (d). e, The number of associated NMR measures for each of 3,007 mQTL groups opposed to associations reported in the GWAS Catalog after pruning the GWAS Catalog for metabolic phenotypes (Methods). Coloring is according to modes of pleiotropy. f, A scatterplot opposing the number of associated NMR measures (x axis) of each mQTL group with the number of reported EFO parent categories in the GWAS Catalog. g, ORs (rectangle) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs; lines) from logistic regression models testing whether EFO categories (x axis) are more frequently reported for pleiotropic mQTL groups compared with specific ones. Darker colors indicated estimates passing corrected statistical significance. n = 3,007 mQTL groups have been used for enrichment testing.

The remaining half of pleiotropic mQTLs showed evidence for two modes of horizontal pleiotropy: those with evidence for ‘disproportional pleiotropy' (n = 68) and a larger group with evidence for ‘nonspecific pleiotropy' (n = 720). For example, a small deletion on chromosome 1 (chr1:92982441:CA>C) was associated with a highly correlated cluster of NMR measures, including characteristics of intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), LDL and VLDL particles (Fig. 3c), but for which we detected no correlation of association strengths according to the lead NMR measure, the concentration of esterified cholesterol in medium-sized VLDL particles (P < 6.8 × 10−14). We prioritized EVI5 as the most likely effector gene, supported by previous studies on rare functional variants25. The gene product of EVI5, ecotropic viral integration site 5, has no apparent link to (lipoprotein) metabolism, in line with most of the gene assignments for mQTLs with a similar nonspecific pleiotropy pattern. An example of nonspecific pleiotropy was the APOB missense variant rs676210 (p.Pro2739Leu) associated with 126 NMR measures across the entire lipoprotein density range, but also creatinine and glycoprotein acetyl concentrations (Fig. 3d). The differential effects of the same genetic variation on distinct lipoprotein subgroups aligns with changes in lipid profiles seen with mipomersen, an antisense oligonucleotide against APOB, that demonstrated reductions in LDL cholesterol but also subsequent increases in the triglyceride content of VLDL particles as hepatic adaption occurs26.

Modes of molecular pleiotropy only partially translated into phenotypic pleiotropy (Fig. 3e,f). We observed a twofold enrichment of ‘proportional pleiotropic' (OR 2.11; P < 2.0 × 10−14) and to a lesser extent an enrichment of ‘nonspecific pleiotropic' (OR 1.52; P < 1.1 × 10−5) variants among variants reported in the GWAS Catalog for ≥5 nonmetabolomic trait categories (Methods). By contrast, the set of pleiotropic GWAS Catalog variants was significantly depleted for ‘specific' mQTLs (OR 0.42; P < 1.6 × 10−21). Systemic mechanisms explaining effects of ‘proportional' and ‘nonspecific' pleiotropic mQTLs were further indicated by a more than 20-fold significant enrichment of associated trait categories such as ‘metabolic disease', ‘fatty liver disease' and ‘arterial disorders' (Fig. 3g).

We next sought to understand convergence of rare and common genetic findings to systematically identify allelic series that increase confidence in causal gene assignment. We identified rare variation (MAF ≤0.05%) in 209 genes to be significantly (P < 1.1 × 10−8) linked to one or more of 249 NMR measures combining ultrarare gene burden analysis (3,709 significant associations; Supplementary Table 8) and rare exonic variant analysis (4,131 significant associations; Supplementary Table 9). Effect sizes were significantly larger compared with more frequent variant effects (Fig. 4a). For example, participants carrying rare predicted loss-of-function (LoF) variants in SLC13A5 had more than 1.4 s.d. units higher plasma citrate concentrations per copy of the possibly damaging allele (β = 1.41; P < 2.6 × 10−20).

The dotted horizontal line indicates the multiple testing threshold (P < 2.0 × 10−10). c, Genomic distance between gene burden (blue) or rare exonic variants (orange) toward the next common credible set variant. d, Evidence for allelic series based on (i) gene burden analysis (bottom), (ii) rare exonic variants (middle) and (iii) common variants with prioritized effector gene matching to the evidence from exonic analysis. For each gene, only the NMR measure most significantly associated with the strongest common variant is shown in cases where multiple NMR measures were associated. Some bars for the number of associated rare exonic variants have been capped to fit into plotting margin, but the number is given in the plot. e, Effect estimates (dots) and 95% CIs (lines) from our European-based exWAS for 7 variants mapping to APOA1 as well as a cumulative burden of high-confidence pLOF variants within APOA1 and bespoke circulating measures of ApoA1 (clinical indicates measurements by immunoturbidimetric analysis on a Beckman Coulter AU5800) and HDL particles (color gradient). f, Top: a heatmap of standardized effect estimates (per variant) across 87 NMR measures for each associated variant and a cumulative burden within APOA1. Variants mapping into the region encoding the protein are surrounded by a rectangle. Variant effects have been aligned to the minor allele. Middle: the corresponding variants mapped to their respective transcripts encoding different forms of APOA1. Bottom: missense variants mapped onto the amino acid sequence of the protein. Variant names colored similarly had highly correlated association profiles.

We also observed considerable pleiotropy, including 47 genes associated with 20 or more NMR measures. Many of these genes encode for well-known enzymes and transportes, with nearly half (n = 23/51 genes) being involved in (peripheral) cholesterol metabolism (Extended Data Fig. 8). Some rare pleiotropic variants with large effect sizes (MAF <0.02% and β > 0.6 s.d. units) pointed toward less-established regulators of metabolism, including SIDT2 (chr11:117186662:C>T, n = 124 associated NMR traits), JAK2 (chr9:5073770:G>T (p.Val617Phe), n = 73 associated NMR traits) or CEP164 (chr11:117356670:C>G, n = 49 associated NMR traits). Experimental work already suggested a role for the gene product of SIDT2 (SID1 transmembrane family member 2) in hepatic lipid metabolism and apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) secretion, the main protein component of HDL particles, which constituted the majority of associated NMR measures27,28 (Fig. 4b). Variation in JAK2 predisposes to somatic mutations inducing hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP)29, but other studies linked the gene product Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) to metabolism in liver30, adipocytes31 or macrophages32. The strong inverse association with parameters of HDL particles thereby best aligned with a role of JAK2 in promoting the interaction with ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and subsequent HDL-mediated lipid removal from cells, including atherogenic macrophages32. These findings considerably expanded an earlier hypothesis that attributed effects of the same JAK2 variant on LDL cholesterol primarily to myeloid cells in a mouse model33. This hypothesis only partially aligns with—and in some respects contrasts—our human genetic findings across the lipoprotein-density gradient.

We observed strong overlap between gene burden and common variant findings, with 85.4% of rare variant (n = 3,528) and 75.5% of gene burden (n = 2,802) associations being <100 kb away from the nearest statistically independent lead credible set variant (Fig. 4c). By contrast, most common variant findings (92.3%) were not within 500 kb of matching rare variant/burden evidence. Notably, 12.1% of gene burden results were more than 1 Mb away from the next common credible set variant for the respective NMR measure, aligning with recent observations that both approaches prioritize partly different genes34.

At 116 genes (55.5%), rare variant and/or burden evidence overlapped with effector gene predictions for close by common credible set variants (≤200 kb) for one or more associated NMR measure (Fig. 4d), providing independent support for allelic series (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Table 10). For example, we identified an allelic series composed of seven rare LoF, one gain-of-function and four common variants for serum citrate levels at SLC13A5 encoding a sodium-dependent citrate co-transporter. Another allelic series at ANKH comprised four common variants (rs185448606, MAF 1.3%; rs17250977, MAF 4.0%; rs826351, MAF 44.3%; rs2921604, MAF 45.9%) and a rare missense variant chr5:14745916:T>C (MAF 0.0069%) being also associated with lower serum concentrations of citrate (β = −2.18 s.d. units, P < 5.2 × 10−11) (Fig. 4d). ANKH encodes a multipass transporter, recently shown to transport citrate35, with an important role in bone health35.

We observed evidence that genetic variants within 17 genes associated with >10 NMR measures had differential metabolic consequences within an allelic series (Supplementary Table 10). The most outstanding example included seven variants (five rare; two common) and a cumulative burden of rare predicted LoF variants at APOA1. They distinctively associated with one or more of 87 NMR measures, most strongly with diverse characteristics of HDL particles of which the gene product, Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), is the major component (Fig. 4e,f). This included four rare missense variants (MAF ≤0.03%) encoded in exon 4 that partly differentially associated with the number, size and cholesterol content of HDL particles (Fig. 4e), only one of which (p.Leu158Pro) primarily associated with serum ApoA1 concentrations and HDL particle number, mimicking the cumulative burden of high-confidence predicted LoF variants in APOA1 and suggesting a potentially dysfunctional protein that lacks interaction with lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase to facilitate cholesterol uptake36. By contrast, p.Lys131del and p.Arg201Ser seemed to rather predispose to a shift in cholesterol content from large towards small HDL particles, a pattern opposed by p.Asp113Glu (Fig. 4e). Consistently, amyloid formation by ApoA1 has been observed in early case reports of p.Lys131del (ApoA-IHelsinki37) in which HDL-cholesterol or ApoA1 concentrations are only mildly changed but aggregation of misfolded ApoA1 protein can confer organ damage later in life38. Because p.Asp113Glu and p.Arg201Ser have not yet been identified to cause amyloidosis, we cannot rule out the possibility that each variant maps to distinctive parts of ApoA1 with subsequently different consequences on function and/or stability (Supplementary Fig. 4). While results for serum ApoA1 concentrations were largely confirmed using an alternative assay, we observed some discrepancies that may imply that, in the presence of rare missense variants, the procedure to quantify ApoA1 concentrations from 1H NMR spectra may need recalibration.

We observed a >3-fold enrichment of genes previously linked to Mendelian diseases39 (‘OMIM genes') among those associated with NMR measures in gene burden and rare exonic variant analyses (OR 3.30, P < 6.5 × 10−17; Supplementary Table 11), in line with previous mGWAS1,2,7,8. For 15 out of 106 genes, we found evidence of significantly associated disease risk (P < 7.5 × 10−7), largely replicating signs and symptoms of corresponding rare disorders (Supplementary Note and Supplementary Table 12). When we tested more generally whether a rare variant burden in metabolic genes was associated with disease susceptibility, we observed a significant enrichment among susceptibility genes for endocrine and metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes and different lipidemias but not among other disease categories (Supplementary Fig. 5).

Genetic predisposition to high LDL cholesterol is strongly associated with increased atherosclerotic CVD (ACVD) risk (‘level effect'), and genetic variations that mimic potent drug targets, such as at PCSK9, show strong evidence of shared effects on both LDL cholesterol and ACVD (‘locus effect')40. To identify potential pathways to mitigate the residual risk not addressed by lowering of LDL cholesterol41, we systematically integrated outcome data across 25 CVD phenotypes42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56 with NMR phenotypes (Supplementary Table 13).

We identified significant evidence (false discovery rate (FDR) <5%) for 1,146 ‘level effects' across 218 NMR measures with one or more of 22 CVD phenotypes using pleiotropy-curated genetic instruments in Mendelian randomization (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Table 14). Independently, we observed evidence for 5,527 ‘locus effects', suggesting a shared genetic architecture (posterior probability (PP) >80%) between 87 mQTLs associated with 247 NMR measures and 17 CVD phenotypes (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Table 15). For 46 NMR–CVD combinations, we found converging evidence for level and locus effects, including 23 not associated in our study with parameters of LDL metabolism (Fig. 5b), providing potential alternatives for addressing residual cardiovascular risk (Supplementary Table 16).

The y axis is a two-sided raw −log10(P value) derived from the European ancestry-based GWAS (n = 434,646). e, LocusZoom plot centered around VEGFA demonstrating colocalization for the genetic signal for HDL particle size and CAD. The y axis represents the raw −log10(P value) from the European ancestry-based GWAS.

For example, we observed robust evidence that, among other measures related to HDL size and composition, genetic susceptibility to larger HDL particle size was associated with a 35% reduced risk of coronary artery disease (CAD; OR 0.65; 95% CI 0.50–0.83; Padj < 0.007; Fig. 5c) along with evidence of a shared and directionally concordant genetic signal at the VEGFA locus (rs4711750, PP 99%; Fig. 5e). The locus has been implicated in CAD risk42, and our results now suggest that one likely pathway to modulate CAD risk might be via HDL particle size or characteristics of large HDL particles not captured by HDL cholesterol. Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), encoded by VEGFA, is primarily known for its role in angiogenesis57 but has been described as a regulatory factor of transendothelial transport of esterified cholesterol from HDL but not LDL particles via activation of scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) during reverse cholesterol transport58. Inhibition of VEGFA is a major pharmaceutical target to suppress vascularization of malignant tumors57, and agents targeting VEGF signaling are well known for adverse cardiovascular effects59, suggesting that VEGFA activation, rather than inhibition, might be necessary to reduce CAD risk. Our observations contribute to a growing body of evidence that more tailored approaches, rather than increasing HDL cholesterol content, will probably be needed for potential cardiovascular benefits, given the discouraging trials for most agents increasing HDL cholesterol60. We note, however, that HDL-particle size might still only be a ‘measurable' surrogate, rather than being the true underlying mechanism. For example, inhibition of reverse cholesterol transport via dysfunctional SR-BI increased HDL particle size as well as CAD risk61.

Having established pleiotropy categories, we finally aimed to demonstrate its application for nonlipid NMR measures in a disease-wide Mendelian randomization screen (Supplementary Note and Supplementary Table 17).

We observed converging evidence for a risk-increasing effect of genetically predicted plasma glycoprotein acetyl concentrations on type 2 diabetes risk (OR per 1 s.d. increase 1.67; P < 3.9 × 10−7) that persisted after exluding variants with evidence for phenotypic pleiotropy (OR 1.69; P < 9.1 × 10−5). This is in line with the rare LoF variant chr20:44413714:C>T (MAF 0.02%) within HNF4A on plasma glycoprotein acetyl concentrations (β = 0.60; P < 8.3 × 10−15) and the cumulative effect of ultrarare LoF HNF4A variants on type 2 diabetes risk (OR 2.68; P = 6.5 × 10−10). However, we note that plasma glycoprotein acetyl concentrations proxy a complex chronic inflammatory state62 that warrants further follow-up analysis to establish mechanistic links to type 2 diabetes.

The genetic basis of circulating metabolites provides insights into the complexity of human metabolic regulation and its subsequent influence on health and disease. By integrating common and rare genetic variation with circulating metabolite concentrations in 450,000 individuals from three different ancestries, we provide here a data-driven map of the circulating metabolome across the allele frequency spectrum. This map identifies previously unrecognized modulators of metabolism with potential health implications.

By combining machine-learning-guided common variant-to-gene annotation with rare exonic variation, we provided high-confidence effector gene assignments at >100 loci, including some with less established roles in (lipoprotein) metabolism, such as SIDT2, presenting compelling candidates for functional follow-up studies in humans. Large-scale studies similar to ours, but with a broader coverage of the plasma metabolome, will probably uncover more genes with yet undefined roles in metabolism, complementing hypothesis-driven research in experimental models.

After more than two decades of GWAS, it has become clear that pleiotropic effects of genetic variants are ubiquitous (see, for example, ref. 63). Little distinction has been possible beyond the generic concepts of ‘vertical' and ‘horizontal' pleiotropy or measures of simple counting. We refine these concepts by observing variants associated with dozens of NMR measures but consistent with the concept of effects diluting or propagating along. Conversely, we observe variants associated with comparatively few NMR measures in an inconsistent pattern, suggesting distinct effects on otherwise highly correlated traits. Our data-driven approach augments previous concepts based on biochemical pathways reporting directionally discordant pleiotropy to discover metabolic bottlenecks64.

Disturbance in metabolism or rearrangements thereof are a hallmark of many diseases, including those not classically considered as ‘metabolic', such as eye disorders2, but whether these are pathways for prevention or intervention, rather than a consequence of the disease, often remains elusive in humans. We demonstrated considerable overlap between mQTLs with disease risk loci, including rare-to-common allelic series that can reveal unknown effector genes. However, many such ‘locus effects' were characterized by nonspecific pleiotropy, implicating the plasma metabolite as a bystander rather than cause of the disease. This observation aligns with the relatively few notable exceptions, such as HDL particle characteristics and CAD, from two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses that contrasted the broad spectrum of observed disease associations described for the same NMR platform65. These observations might be best explained by the concept of metabolic flexibility, which includes built-in redundancy in key pathways to combat various intrinsic and extrinsic perturbations.

An important distinction of our study compared with most previous efforts was the availability of highly standardized measurements in a well-designed single large cohort, mitigating influences of preanalytical variables and enabling analyses of even ultrarare variants. However, this also meant that we had little opportunity to investigate the influence of different states of metabolism on our genetic results (such as an overnight fast) or investigate robustness of findings in different environments or at scale in other ancestries. For example, UKB participants were not asked to fast overnight before their baseline visit, which has been shown to impact genetic findings3. Other limitations included the sensitivity and coverage of the 1H NMR platform, and future efforts are likely to reveal more diverse phenotypic consequences of genetically constrained flexibility of human metabolism. Another technical aspect to consider in the interpretation of our results is the indirect nature of 1H NMR derived measurements of certain analytes, including apolipoproteins, that may no longer be reliable in the presence of rare damaging variants that change the properties of apolipoproteins as observed for ApoA1.

The UKB is a prospective cohort study from the UK that contains more than 500,000 volunteers between 40 and 69 years of age at inclusion. The study design, sample characteristics and genotype data have been described elsewhere66,67. The UKB was approved by the National Research Ethics Service Committee North West Multi-Centre Haydock and all study procedures were performed in accordance with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki ethical principles for medical research. We included 460,036 individuals across the three major ancestries in UKB in our analyses for whom inclusion criteria (given consent to further usage of the data, availability of genetic data and passed quality control (QC) of genetic data) applied. Data from UKB were linked to death registries and hospital episode statistics (HES). We used the ancestry assignments as defined by the pan-UKB68 and further assigned unclassified individuals to their respective ancestries based on a k-nearest neighbor approach using genetic principal components. All analyses were conducted under UKB applications 44448 and 30418.

Up to 249 targeted metabolomic measurements were quantified using the Nightingale NMR platform in human EDTA plasma samples. Detailed experimental procedures for the NMR platform are described elsewhere65,69. The NMR platform covers a wide range of metabolic biomarkers, including lipoprotein lipids, fatty acids and small molecules such as amino acids, ketone bodies and glycolysis metabolites, quantified in molar concentration units. We combine here three data releases that cover the full breadth of the UKB. Metabolomics data were available for 482,276 individuals, including 19,699 samples with data from baseline and repeat visit.

Metabolites were reliably detected, with only one biomarker over 2.5% missingness in releases 1/2 (creatinine) and release 3 (3-hydroxybutyrate). Ninety-eight percent of the samples had <5% missingness over all biomarkers in releases 1/2 and release 3. We used the ukbnmr70 R package (v2.2, R v4.3.2) for QC and removal of technical variation in the NMR data. This includes technical confounders such as sample preparation time, shipping plate well, spectrometer effects, time drift within spectrometers and outlier plates.

We removed samples that were flagged by Nightingale for poor quality and used the MICE (Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations)71 R package to impute the remaining dataset. In total, we imputed 0.16% and 0.17% of data in releases 1/2 and release 3, respectively.

We observed overall good consistency with the overlapping routine blood biomarkers previously measured in the same cohort (median r = 0.9, range 0.62–0.94) (Extended Data Fig. 9).

We sought to adjust the NMR data for medication use, especially cholesterol-lowering medication, to avoid false-positive results driven by medication use in downstream genetic analyses. For male and female participants separately, we fit linear models to quantify the impact of six drug categories on each NMR phenotype: cholesterol-lowering medicine, blood pressure medication, diabetic medication including Metformin usage, oral contraceptive pill or minipill (female only) and hormone replacement therapy (female only) (UKB fields 6177 and 6153) (Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 18).

We used data from individuals with both baseline (NMRbaseline) and repeat (NMRfollow-up) assessment metabolic data available and estimated the effect of medication (med terms) in individuals that did not take any drugs at the time of the baseline visit (n = 6,312 male, n = 6,713 female participants) using the following model:

We note that the sample sizes for diabetic medication (nmale = 45, nfemale = 29), oral contraceptive medication (n = 27) and hormone replacement therapy (n = 148) were too small to reliably estimate any effects. Effect estimates for diabetic medication were correlated to estimates for cholesterol-lowering medicine. The effect estimates for blood pressure medication were minimal across the phenotypes. We considered thus only the impact of cholesterol-lowering medicine and corrected the metabolic data in a sex-specific manner.

GWAS was performed on 249 metabolic traits measured by the NMR platform on British European (n = 434,646), British Central/South Asian (n = 8,796) and British African participants (n = 6,573) that had complete phenotypic, covariate and genetic information available. We used the Haplotype Reference Consortium-imputed genetic data, including all autosomal chromosomes and the X chromosome. We performed GWAS under the additive model using REGENIE (v3.2.5)72 that uses a two-step procedure to account for population structure. We derived a set of high-quality genotyped variants per population by applying the following filters: (MAF >1%, minor allele count (MAC) >100, missingness rate <10%, PHWE > 1 × 10−15). Furthermore, linkage disequilibrium pruning was performed using a 1,000-kb window, shifting by 100 variants and removing variants with LD (r2) >0.8. We used these variants as input for the first step of REGENIE to generate individual trait predictions using the leave-one-chromosome-out scheme. These predictions are used in the second step where individual variants are tested. Models were adjusted for age, sex and the first ten genetic principal components. We tested variants with a MAF >0.5%, amounting to 11.5 million variants in British European individuals, 11.5 million variants in British Central/South Asian individuals and 19.3 million variants in British African individuals.

For initial discovery, we performed a meta-analysis across the three ancestral groups using METAL73. We required variants to be present in at least two ancestral groups. To declare significance, we considered a stringent P-value threshold (2.0 × 10−10) by dividing the standard genome-wide threshold by the number of metabolic phenotypes (5.0 × 10−8/249).

We tested our results for genomic inflation and calculated the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability using LD-score regression74 (Supplementary Table 19).

We used regional clumping (±500 kb) around sentinel variants from the analyses including British European samples to select independent genomic regions associated with a metabolic phenotype and collapsed neighboring regions using BEDtools (v2.30.0). We treated the extended MHC region (chr6: 25.5–34.0 Mb) as one region.

Within each region of interest, excluding the MHC region, we performed statistical fine-mapping for all phenotypes associated with that region using the ‘Sum of single effects' model (SuSiE) implemented in the susieR (v0.12.35) R package75. In brief, SuSiE uses a Bayesian framework for variable selection in a multiple regression problem with the aim to identify sets of independent variants each of which probably contains the true causally underlying genetic variant. We implemented the workflow using default prior and parameter settings, apart from the minimum absolute correlation, which we set to 0.1. Because SuSiE is implemented in a linear regression framework, we used the GWAS summary statistics with a matching correlation matrix of dosage genotypes instead of individual-level data to implement fine-mapping (susie_rss()) as recommended by the authors75.

To determine the appropriate number of credible sets within each region, we iterated over the maximum credible sets parameter in susieR from two to ten, thus generating fine-mapped results constrained to a range of maximum number of credible sets. For each collection of credible sets, we pruned sets where the lead variant was correlated to the lead variant of other credible sets (r2 > 0.25). After pruning, we considered the fine-mapped results with the largest number of credible sets.

We performed several sensitivity analyses by computing joint models per locus–phenotype combination, jointly modeling the effect of all distinct lead credible set variants in a single linear model. Subsequently, we retained only credible sets where the lead variant reached genome-wide significance (P = 5.0 × 10−8) in both marginal and joint statistics. Furthermore, we ensured the estimated coefficients were directionally concordant and of similar magnitude between joint and marginal models (±25%). Linear models were implemented in R using the glm() function and used only unrelated British European participants and the same set of covariates as described above.

Finally, we used LD clumping (r2 > 0.6) to identify credible sets shared across metabolic phenotypes.

We computed the correlation matrix with LDscore v2.0 using genetic data from 50,000 randomly selected, unrelated White European UKB participants. In situations where SuSiE did not deliver a credible set, we used the Wakefield approximation76 to compute 95%-credible sets.

We replicated our trans-ancestral genetic signals using two independent studies: (1) the so-far largest published mGWAS3 and (2) a parallel effort using overlapping UKB data9, both using the same NMR platform. We considered a set of metabolic traits that were directly measured by the NMR platform and not inferred from other traits to avoid multiplicative errors in these more sensitive phenotypes. In total, we were able to match 144 (Karjalainen et al.3) and 169 (Tambets et al.9) metabolic traits, for which we compared sentinel variants that passed metabolome-adjusted, genome-wide significance in our trans-ancestral meta-analysis and that overlapped between the studies.

To assign candidate genes for all metabolite QTLs residing outside the MHC region, we first collected annotations for each genetic variant or proxies thereof (r2 > 0.6), including distance to the gene body and putative functional consequences based on the Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) tool offered by Ensembl. We further collated up to ten closest genes within a 2-Mb window and subsequent gene features such as: (1) eQTL evidence for a given variant–gene pair for each tissue available in the eQTL Catalogue release 777; (2) evidence of being annotated as metabolic in the MGI or Orphanet databases as defined in ProGem19; (3) evidence of being listed in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database39; (4) and evidence of being an already assigned drug target in Open Targets78 clinical stages III and IV.

With no universally accepted standard for variant-to-gene assignments, we relied on prior biological and genomic information to create three sets of ‘putative true positive' (PTP) set: genes part of cholesterol pathway in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)79 or REACTOME80 database (n = 6,791, 722 unique SNPs), lipid pathway (n = 5,670, 603 unique SNPs) and amino acid-related pathway (n = 8,349, 895 unique SNPs). We used all fine-mapped SNPs associated with metabolites classified in the respective NMR metabolite class (Cholesterol: cholesterol, cholesteryl esters, free cholesterol; Lipid: total lipids, other lipids, relative lipid concentration, phospholipids; Amino Acid: amino acid) in the PTP set and used overlapping SNPs in only one PTP set. We trained (7:3 training:test ratio without overlapping variants) a random forest classifier using fivefold cross-validation with subsampling to account for the unbalanced datasets (scikit-learn v1.4.1). We used the balanced accuracy score to choose the best-performing forest from each training set. Subsequently, we used the best-performing classifier from each PTP set to assign candidate scores for all putative effector genes across the entire set of metabolite QTLs. We calculated the median score across classifiers and selected the highest-scoring gene per variant. Within each PTP set, we omitted features used to define true positive sets. Each of the three classifiers exhibited consistent performance (mean ROC-AUC: 0.80, mean balanced accuracy score 0.69) (Supplementary Fig. 7). We used the sum across all three classifiers to assign effector gene scores but present only genes as potential effector genes that reached sufficient support as indicated by largest difference between consecutively prioritized genes.

To provide another layer of evidence for assignment of causal genes at metabolic loci, we performed cis-colocalization with protein targets measured in the independent Fenland study22. Cis (for example, gene body ± 500 kb) summary statistics were preprocessed using MungeSumStats81. To relax the single causal variant assumption, we used a colocalization approach where we fine-mapped all traits with SuSiE and then performed colocalization among all credible sets using functionality of the coloc (v5.2.3)82,83 and susieR (v0.12.35)75 R packages. For this, we set the prior probability that a SNP is associated with both traits to 5 × 10−6 and restricted the maximum number of credible sets for the outcome data to five82.

We tested whether genes proximal to metabolic loci and assigned effector genes were enriched in tissue compartments by leveraging data from the Human Protein Atlas84. Specifically, we used a two-sided Fisher's test whether metabolic genes were enriched among tissue-specific genes (tissue-enriched or tissue-enhanced as defined by the Protein Atlas) against all protein-coding genes as background.

To assign modes of pleiotropy for each mQTL, we first clumped lead credible set variants across NMR measures by LD, collating variants with r2 ≥ 0.6 as a single signal, referred to hereafter as mQTL group. This was done based on dosage files of all unrelated British European UKB participants and implemented with the igraph (v.2.0.1.1) package in R. For each mQTL, we computed pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients among associated NMR measures. We classified each mQTL group on: (1) the 25th percentile of all pairwise correlations, and (2) the Pearson correlation coefficient between the association strengths for each measure (− log10(P value)) and its correlation coefficient with the most strongly associated measure within the mQTL. The latter is a measure to what extent the association between NMR measures at a given locus (‘pleiotropy') can be explained by being correlated with the most proximal associated measure. Based on opposing those two measures for all mQTLs we defined the following five groups: (1) ‘specific' mQTLs associated with only ≤3 highly correlated NMR measures (rho ≥0.6); (2) ‘pathway pleiotropic' mQTLs associated with highly correlated NMR measures (rho ≥0.6) that followed the described association pattern (rho ≥0.6); (3) ‘proportional pleiotropic' mQTL groups associated with, in part, uncorrelated NMR measures but highly correlated association statistics (rho ≥0.6); (4) ‘disproportional pleiotropic' mQTLs associated with highly correlated NMR measures (rho ≥0.6), but without evidence that this translated into a correlation of association statistics (rho <0.6), and; (5) all remaining mQTLs as ‘unspecific pleiotropic' groups.

To quantify the extent to which our pleiotropy assignment extends beyond the NMR measures analyzed here, we intersected mQTLs and proxies thereof with results reported in the GWAS Catalog (downloaded 20 May 2024). We first pruned GWAS Catalog entries for those with mapped traits (to minimize double counting), results that met genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10−8) and had location information available. We further dropped results similar to NMR measures based on broad Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO) terms (for example, EFO:0005105 and child terms indicating ‘lipid or lipoprotein measurement'). To further account for traits mapping to similar categories, we iteratively traced back-mapped EFO terms to broader parent terms. We finally classified mQTLs to be ‘specific' in the GWAS Catalog if they associated with fewer than five parent EFO terms and ‘unspecific' otherwise.

We next aimed to investigate the shared genetic basis of the 249 NMR and 25 selected CVD traits. We utilized public databases (GWAS Catalog, openGWAS, CVD-KP) to collect CVD data comprising the largest currently publicly available GWAS datasets on CAD and myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, aortic aneurysm, heart failure and stroke, and peripheral arterial disease, including two to five subtypes for some phenotypes (Supplementary Table 13). Data were harmonized and, if necessary, lifted over to GRCh37 using the MungeSumstats (v1.13.2) R package81. We queried mQTL lead variants and proxies in strong LD (r2 > 0.8; LD backbone based on UKB, as described above) of each NMR trait in each region and corresponding summary statistics for each CVD trait.

To investigate ‘locus' effects, we performed statistical colocalization for all combinations of the NMR traits–CVD traits as described before (see ‘Causal gene assignment' section).

To estimate ‘level' effects of NMR metabolite concentrations on CVD outcomes, we performed Mendelian Randomization analysis using the TwoSampleMR package (v0.5.1), implementing the inverse-variance weighted and the MR-Egger methods. We used all 249 NMR metabolites as exposure variables, the 25 CVDs as outcome variables and assessed separately four sets of instruments: (1) sentinel variants, (2) lead credible set variants, (3) lead credible set variants restricted for molecular pleiotropy (for example, ‘pathway pleiotropy') and (4) lead credible set variants restricted for both molecular and phenotypic pleiotropy. We used the Wald ratio method to estimate the effect of NMR concentrations on CVD outcomes using only single genetic variants85. We used MR-Egger to test for evidence of a pleiotropic association, an intercept P value >0.0001 indicating evidence of no pleiotropy and checked for concordance between the effect estimates of inverse-variance weighted Mendelian randomisation (IVW-MR), MR-Egger and single genetic variant MR. We controlled the FDR at 5% (ref. 86). To further limit the possible extent of pleiotropic associations, we only reported ‘level effects' passing these filters in the variant sets 2–4, prioritizing the association in the more stringent variant set.

The overlap of ‘locus effects' showing no ‘disproportional pleiotropy' according to the section ‘Pleiotropy assignment and overlap with the GWAS Catalog' as well as a significant single variant MR (FDR 5%) and ‘level effects' calculated from metabolite-specific or metabolite- and phenome-specific variants was used to identify gene–metabolite pairs associated with CVD risk independent of LDL metabolism. We considered loci as independent from LDL metabolism if they did not associate with clinical LDL cholesterol at the locus with P < 2.0 × 10−10 and the effect estimate of any variant on clinical LDL-C ranked upward the 80th percentile of all effect estimates at the locus.

An in-depth description of whole exome sequencing, including experimental details, variant calling and standard QC measures for the UKB has been extensively reported by Backman et al.87. We performed additional QC steps at the UKB Research Analysis Platform (RAP; https://ukbiobank.dnanexus.com/).

We used bcftools (v1.15.1) to process population-level Variant Call Format (pVCF) files. Initially, we normalized the data using the reference sequence GRCh38 build, followed by splitting multiallelic variants. Subsequently, we conducted QC on these variants using a set of parameters outlined below to filter high-quality variants for downstream genetic analyses. Genotypes for SNPs were set to missing if the read depth was less than 7 (or less than 10 for INDELs) or if the genotype quality was below 20. Furthermore, we excluded variants if the allele balance was less than 0.25 or greater than 0.8 in heterozygous carriers. Finally, we excluded variants with missingness >50%.

Variants were annotated using ENSEMBL VEP88 (v106.1) with the most severe consequence for each variant chosen across all protein-coding transcripts. We further utilized additional plugins REVEL89, CADD v1.690 and LOFTEE91 for variant annotation. Based on these scores, we defined six partially overlapping variant masks: (1) high-confidence predicted LoF (pLOF, based on LOFTEE and includes stop-gained, splice site disrupting, and frameshift variants); (2) any pLOF assigned high impact by VEP; (3) pLOF and high-impact missense variants (CADD score >20 or REVEL score >0.5); (4) pLOF and any missense variants; (5) only high-impact variants; and (6) any missense variants but not pLOF. We tested synonymous variants separately as a negative control. We tested each mask in different MAF bins, using 0.5% and 0.005% as thresholds.

We performed rare variant association testing (RVAT) using whole exome sequencing (WES) data across 249 NMR phenotypes using REGENIE (v3.1.1) via the DNAnexus Swiss Army Knife tool (v4.9.1). Similar to common variant GWASs, we used a two-step approach by REGENIE. We additionally generated step 1 leave-one-chromosome-out (LOCO) files with and without adjusting for common signals via a polygenic score (PGS derived from all lead credible set variant per NMR trait) in the RVAT models per phenotype. All RVAT models were then adjusted for PGS in addition to age, biological sex, fasting duration and the first ten genetic PCs. We first performed aggregated gene burden testing across for 19,026 genes using a set of masks as defined above. For gene burden testing, we used the aggregated Cauchy association test to estimate P values for each gene across masks and allele frequency bins. The aggregated Cauchy association test first computes P values for all sets defined by various masks within a gene and then takes these P values as input to compute one P value for the respective gene via a well-approximated Cauchy distribution.

We performed single variant association testing for exonic variants (ExWAS). For the ExWAS, we tested variants with MAC >5 and reported results for variants with MAF <0.0005. We have performed these analyses in individuals of British European, British African and British Central/South Asian ancestry.

We considered findings as robust if they passed multiple-testing-corrected statistical significance (gene burden: P < 1.2 × 10−8 (corrected for the number of genes × number of traits); ExWAS: P < 2.0 × 10−10 (same as for common variant GWAS, conventional genome-wide significance corrected for the number of traits)) in both the model with and without adjusting for the common variant PGS and effect sizes did not differ by more than 20% between these models, as this might otherwise indicate that rare variant findings cannot clearly be distinguished from common variant effects.

To systematically test for phenotypic consequences of genes identified through rare variant analysis, we collated 626 disease entities following previous work1 by aggregating information from self-report, HES, death certificates and primary care data (45% of the UKB population). Each disease entity had at least one significant common variant, and we used a similar analysis workflow using REGENIE as described for NMR measures but using logistic regression with saddle point approximation.

We downloaded the OMIM gene–disease list (9 November 2023) and kept 7,327 unique entries after filtering for gene entries with high confidence (level 3). We computed the enrichment of genes associated with any NMR measure from rare variant or gene burden analysis against a background of 19,989 protein coding genes using Fisher's exact test.

a, Replication of estimated genetic effects on circulating metabolites in Karjalainen et al.3. Bar plots represent the correlation of effect sizes (top), correlation between the P-value (middle), and the fraction of our sentinel variants that reached genome-wide significance in the replication study (bottom). b, Identical to a but using data from Tambets et al.9. For both comparisons, we only considered directly measured traits.

a, b, Cross-ancestry comparison of estimated genetic effects. Comparing estimates (points) obtained within UK Biobank participants of European ancestry (x-axis, n = 434,646) to those of British Central/South Asian ancestry (n = 8,796) (a) or British African ancestry (n = 6,573) (b). Bars denote standard errors of the estimates.

Variance explained by fine-mapped lead variants on metabolomic concentrations. Each dot represents a metabolite, colored for biochemical class. Boxplot center refers to the median, bounds are the upper and lower quartiles, and whiskers indicate 1.5× interquartile range.

Forest plot showing the strongest associated NMR traits for rs3747207, previously associated with LDL-cholesterol. Stars represent whether traits are significantly differently associated compared to LDL-cholesterol. Effect estimates (dots) and standard errors of the estimate (bars) are taken from the European ancestry-based GWAS (n = 434,646).

a, b, Odds ratios for enrichment of assigned effector genes (a) and genes proximal to fine-mapped lead variants (b) across tissue compartments. Columns represent each of the 249 metabolic traits, annotated for biochemical class. Rows and columns were clustered based on Euclidean distance. Odds ratios are derived from a two-sided Fisher's test.

a, Scatterplot opposing mQTL characteristics. The x-axis denotes for each mQTL the 25th percentile of all possible correlations among associated NMR measures. The y-axis depicts the correlation between the strongest trait of interest and the association strength for all other traits. A value of one would indicate that all other associated NMR measures can be directly explained as function of correlation, whereas a value of zero would indicate independent effects of the mQTL on different measures. b, Bar plot showing number of variants for each mode of pleiotropy. c-f, Same Pearson correlation networks of NMR measures, clustering highly correlated traits by spatial proximity. Each node is colored according to the strength of associations ( − log10(P-value)) with one of the four genetic variants indicated in the title of each plot. Variants were chosen to represent each of the four modes of pleiotropy.

Convergence of gene burden (blue) and common variant (orange) burden results for genes involved in cholesterol metabolism.

Comparison of eight metabolic traits measured on the NMR platform (x axis) overlapping with routine blood biomarkers previously measured in the same cohort (y axis).

Metrics details

Current clinical antibiotics are largely broad-spectrum agents that can alter the gut microbiome and promote colonization by Enterobacteriaceae, which are often drug resistant. This includes adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC), particularly in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, in which dysbiosis creates a niche for this pathogen to colonize. There is an urgent and unmet need for novel narrow-spectrum and microbiome-sparing antibiotics. Here we screened 10,747 bioactive small molecules for antibacterial activity against AIEC and discovered enterololin, an antibacterial compound with targeted activity against Enterobacteriaceae species. Enterololin could overcome intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms in clinical isolates when combined with a subinhibitory concentration of SPR741, a polymyxin B analogue used here to increase outer membrane permeability in Gram-negative bacteria. Molecular substructure- and deep learning-guided mechanism-of-action investigations revealed that enterololin perturbs lipoprotein trafficking through a mechanism involving the LolCDE complex, laboratory-evolved resistant mutants predominantly mapped to lolC and lolE, with an in vitro frequency of resistance of ~10−8 to 10−7. Enterololin showed low mammalian cytotoxicity (HEK293 half-maximal inhibitory concentration ~100 µg ml−1) and suppressed AIEC infection in mouse models when administered in combination with SPR741, while largely preserving the overall microbiome composition. This study highlights the utility of deep learning methods for predicting molecular interactions and identifies a promising Enterobacteriaceae-specific antibacterial candidate for further development.

A strange chirp detected by LIGO in 2019 has some scientists searching for answers beyond a simple black hole merger.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

When the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) detected the very first gravitational wave in 2015, it began a new era of astronomy. It gave scientists a new tool for observing and recording some of the most energetic phenomena in the known-universe—things like supernovae, neutron star collisions, and black hole mergers. Since that first gravitational wave detection (which is called GW150914 and was produced by a black hole merger), LIGO has detected hundreds more, and some of these gravitational waves have inspired new and strange questions.

Case in point—the gravitational wave detection known as GW190521. 

As its name suggests, GW190521 rippled across the Earth on May 21, 2019 (gravitational wave detections are named for their dates of detection, in year-month-day order). The merger of two black holes itself isn't what causes the gravitational waves we can detect—rather, it's the interacting gravitational fields from two massive objects spiraling closer and closer together that create ripples in space-time. As shown with the detection of GW150914 in 2015, this typically results in an audible “chirp” that looks like a rising waveform. 

However, GW190521 lacks this rising signal, otherwise known as the “inspiral” part of the signal. What's strange is that the resulting black hole lies in the intermediate-mass rang (around 142 times the mass of our Sun), so LIGO should have detected the tell-tale inspiral. 

This has led some astronomers to ponder alternative ways that these two black holes could have merged. One idea is that these black holes were caught in a mutual gravity well, essentially allowing them to skip the inspiral signal typically associated with black hole mergers. Others have pondered whether the black holes merged in an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), which could help explain this massive binary system with current astrophysical models. 

But a new paper uploaded by a team of Chinese scientists to the preprint server arXiv has another, more extreme-yet-fascinating proposal: Maybe it's evidence of a wormhole?

“The ringdown signal after binary black holes (BBHs) merged in another universe can pass through the throat of a wormhole and be detected in our universe as a short-duration echo pulse,” the authors wrote. “We hypothesize that GW190521 might represent a single, isolated gravitational wave (GW) echo pulse from the wormhole, which is the post-merger remnant of BBHs in another universe and connected to our universe through a throat.”

This is a “woah if true” assertion, and likely takes the idea of “leaving no stone unturned” to the scientific extreme, especially because wormholes themselves are completely theoretical. An Einstein-Rosen bridge—a mathematical solution for a specific wormhole—requires exotic matter (i.e. negative energy density) in order to be stable. However, when the research team compared their model's network signal-to-noise ratio with that of a BBH merger model, the results were remarkably similar. Using Bayesian statistics to determine the most likely outcome, the BBH model is still preferred, but it's not significant enough to rule out a wormhole solution.

“It might be expected that future enhancements to the echo-for-wormhole waveform templates, incorporating more detailed physical characteristics, hold the potential to significantly improve the corresponding Bayesian factor,” the authors wrote.

This strange 2019 gravitational wave isn't alone. On November 23, 2023, LIGO similarly detected an intermediate-mass black hole with a short-duration ringdown signal, at around 0.1 seconds. This only shows that there's much more to learn about the cosmic engines of these space-time ripples, but whether that includes the existence of wormholes, well... that remains to be seen.

The tourist attraction features a glass elevator going even higher, and will one day serve as a base for bungee jumping and paragliding.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

China likes building high bridges, and they do so in dramatic style. Already boasting the world's highest bridge—defined as the most distance between the bridge deck and the Earth below—the country broke its own record with the recent opening of the Huajiang Grand Canyon Bridge, which stands an eye-popping 2,051 feet above the canyon and Beipan River below. 

The new opening bests the previous leader, Duge Bridge, which was built in 2016 and stands at 1,854 feet above the Beipan River. All this record breaking puts the highest American bridges well down on the list—the highest bridge in the United States, Colorado's Royal Gorge Bridge (which is built from 1,257 wooden planks), stands a comparatively paltry 956 feet above the Arkansas River. 

The Royal Gorge Bridge does have attractions aplenty to make up for its height—think a “skycoaster” and a zipline—to entertain visitors, but even there, the new Huajiang Grand Canyon Bridge won't be outdone. 

The new bridge features a glass elevator that brings tourists even higher than the bridge's surface itself—2,600 feet above the river, for those keeping track—to a coffee shop lookout. There's also a bungee jumping station and plans for a skydiving and paragliding launch at the site. If you want more glass (this time under your feet), a 1,900-foot-tall glass walkway along the bridge gives visitors a fresh perspective on the height and the canyon below. 

The new bridge isn't just high, it's also long. Spanning a total of 9,777 feet, and with a main span of 4,660 feet, the bridge serves a practical purpose—cutting an two-hour-long drive around the mountainous region into a two-minute straight shot over “Earth's crack,” as described by Discover Guizhou. The bridge's owners also claim that the project is now the longest mountain bridge in the world. 

“This bridge makes life so much easier,” said local 67-year-old villager Liang Zudong, according to Discover Guizhou.

The nearly four-year construction project required load testing over five days with a mix of construction equipment—at one time, 96 vehicles were together on the bridge—to simulate traffic movement and test a variety of weight distributions. Sensors on the bridge, according to China.com, monitored how the new structure responded to the weights, both during static loads and when the vehicles raced across at speeds and with sudden braking. 

Wind was the trickiest part of the Huajiang Grand Canyon Bridge construction effort, requiring the contractors to use wind deflectors and stabilizing plates that turned turbulence into balance. The process also featured a temperature control system to manage the concrete's temperature (for structural integrity), and smart cable strands were embedded into the suspension bridge to monitor the bridge's health in real time. 

The Huajiang Grand Canyon Bridge is high-tech, high-thrill, and world-record high.

New research has uncovered a species of hook-toothed lizard that lived about 167 million years ago and has a confusing set of features seen in snakes and geckos -- two very distant relatives. One of the oldest relatively complete fossil lizards yet discovered, the Jurassic specimen is described in a study, published on October 1 in the journal Nature, from a multinational collaboration between the American Museum of Natural History and scientists in the United Kingdom, including University College London and the National Museums Scotland, France, and South Africa.

The species was given the Gaelic name Breugnathair elgolensis meaning "false snake of Elgol," referencing the area in Scotland's Isle of Skye where it was discovered. Breugnathair had snake-like jaws and hook-like, curved teeth similar to those of modern-day pythons, paired with the short body and fully-formed limbs of a lizard.

"Snakes are remarkable animals that evolved long, limbless bodies from lizard-like ancestors," said the study's lead author Roger Benson, Macaulay Curator in the American Museum of Natural History's Division of Paleontology. "Breugnathair has snake-like features of the teeth and jaws, but in other ways, it is surprisingly primitive. This might be telling us that snake ancestors were very different to what we expected, or it could instead be evidence that snake-like predatory habits evolved separately in a primitive, extinct group."

Lizards and snakes together form a group called squamates. Breugnathair has been placed in a new group of extinct, predatory squamates called Parviraptoridae, which was previously known only from more fragmentary fossils. Earlier studies reported snake-like tooth-bearing bones that were found in close proximity with bones that had gecko-like features. But because these seemed so drastically different, some researchers believed they belonged to two different animals. The new work on Breugnathair rejects those earlier findings, showing that both snake-like and gecko-like features exist together in a single animal.

Breugnathair was discovered in 2016 by Stig Walsh from the National Museums Scotland while on an expedition with Benson and others on the Isle of Skye. The researchers have spent almost 10 years since then preparing the specimen, imaging it with computed tomography as well as with high-powered x-rays at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France, and analyzing the results.

"The Jurassic fossil deposits on the Isle of Skye are of world importance for our understanding of the early evolution of many living groups, including lizards, which were beginning their diversification at around this time," said Susan Evans from University College London, who co-led the study. "I first described parviraptorids some 30 years ago based on more fragmentary material, so it's a bit like finding the top of the jigsaw box many years after you puzzled out the original picture from a handful of pieces. The mosaic of primitive and specialized features we find in parviraptorids, as demonstrated by this new specimen, is an important reminder that evolutionary paths can be unpredictable."

Nearly 16 inches long from head to tail, Breugnathair was one of the largest lizards in its ecosystem, where it likely preyed on smaller lizards, early mammals, and other vertebrates, like young dinosaurs. But is it a lizard-like ancestor of snakes? Because it has such an unusual mixture of features, and because other fossils that shed light on early squamate evolution are rare, the researchers did not arrive at a conclusive answer. Another possibility is that Breugnathair could be a stem-squamate, a predecessor of all lizards and snakes, that independently evolved snake-like teeth and jaws.

"This fossil gets us quite far, but it doesn't get us all of the way," Benson said. "However, it makes us even more excited about the possibility of figuring out where snakes come from."

Other study authors include Zoe Kulik from the American Museum of Natural History, Elizabeth Griffiths Jason Head from the University of Cambridge, Jennifer Botha from the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa, and Vincent Fernandez from the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility.

Go Inside a Room That Lets You Hear Your Nervous System

Step into a room so quiet you can hear your own heartbeat—and your nervous system.

By Rachel Feltman, Jeffery DelViscio, Kelso Harper, Fonda Mwangi & Naeem Amarsy 

Science Quickly host Rachel Feltman stands inside the Nokia Bell Labs anechoic chamber in Murray Hill, N.J.

Jeffery DelViscio/Scientific American

Seth Cluett: This experiment just pops a balloon. And normally, when a balloon would pop, you'd hear [makes an exploding noise]—the whole room just kind of expand, right?

[Pops a balloon inside a normal room, making a loud noise.]

Rachel Feltman: Ooh!

Kelso Harper: [Laughs.]

Rachel Feltman: [Laughs.] Yeah.

Cluett: Pretty loud.

Feltman: Yeah, pretty loud [laughs].

Cluett: But in this room there's none of that. So you're gonna hear it as a very sharp sound that just disappears completely.

[Pops a balloon inside an anechoic chamber, making a sharp noise that dissipates immediately.]

Feltman: Ooh!

Cluett: Welcome to the anechoic chamber. Watch your step.

Feltman: Whoa [laughs].

Wow, it is already super quiet in here [laughs].

Cluett: And it's gonna get even more quiet when we close the door.

Feltman: Cool.

Cluett: [Walks to the chamber entrance and closes the outer and inner doors.] How's that?

Feltman: It did get a lot more quiet, yeah [laughs].

Inside one of the quietest rooms in the world, host Rachel Feltman meets artist-in-residence Seth Cluett at the historic anechoic chamber at Bell Labs to explore the science of silence and sound perception.

Welcome to Science Quickly. I'm Rachel Feltman, and today I'm here with Seth Cluett at Nokia Bell Labs. And you may notice if you're listening to this, or if you're watching it, that there's some interesting stuff going on with the sound. Seth, would you tell us more about why that is?

Cluett: Yeah, so we are in the historic anechoic chamber at Bell Labs. It is a room that absorbs 99.999 percent of sound-wave propagation and eliminates sound from the outside almost entirely. It is anechoic, meaning it lacks echo. So an anechoic chamber is intended to absorb as close to 100 percent of incidental reflection as you can possibly do.

This room, as you kinda look around, is a [roughly] 30-by-30 cube with a wire mesh a third up from the floor. You might ask yourself, like, “Why is it a third up from the floor, not in the center?” And the answer is that you want the experiment to happen as close to the middle as possible.

Feltman: Mm.

Cluett: Because the one place where it's scientifically feasible to measure sound exactly is in the center of the cube because the distance to the walls and the reflections are equal in that case.

The building is a shell that has [roughly] two-foot-thick walls and an air gap and then another wall, and that air gap separates the sound waves from the outside. And then inside the room there are these [roughly] four-foot wedge panels in groups of three in an offset kind of orthogonal pattern—a, a grid pattern. They capture the sound waves before they're able to reflect back. So they, they come to a kind of inverted point in the inside of the wall, and when sound gets into that point it kind of bounces back and forth on the diagonal, and by the time it gets to the outside of the wedge there's no more sound energy left to reflect.

Feltman: Mm, so when you're in this totally quiet space what kinds of things can you feel and perceive in your body?

Cluett: Yeah, I think most people feel a kind of pressure against their ears first.

Feltman: Mm.

Cluett: It sort of feels like the air is heavy or thick. Then, then you start to notice a kind of low pulse and realize that's your heart beating and you can hear it in the air, in, in addition to through your body. And for most people you can even hear a high pitch, and you think, “Oh, I have tinnitus,” or “There's something wrong with my hearing.” You're actually hearing your nervous system ...

Feltman: Wow.

Cluett: Bone conduction through your, through your skull, and it's quiet enough that for the first time you can hear a part of your body that's been along with you for the whole time you've been alive.

Feltman: That's very cool. Could ...

Harper: Sorry—what? [Laughs.] That's so crazy.

Jeffery DelViscio: I was just like, “F—, I can hear that.”

Harper: You're just hearing your nervous system ...

Feltman: Yeah, I actually ...

Harper: Okay, no worries.

DelViscio: I'm glad we got that. That was ...

Harper: Sorry, carry on. I'm—I just—I'm so sorry [laughs].

DelViscio: That was really cool.

Feltman: Yeah, now I'm really distracted 'cause I can't stop noticing it.

DelViscio: Listening to your nervous system ....

Cluett: And so that, that, actually, it's starting to go away for you now ...

Feltman: Right.

Cluett: Because of—that's part of the fight-or-flight response because you're hearing it through the ...

Feltman: Yeah.

Cluett: Hypersensitive part of your stereocilia on your basilar membrane that are like, “Wake up! Are there tigers?” [Laughs.] Right? Like ...

Feltman: [Laughs.] Could you show us some demonstrations to maybe help our listeners and viewers understand, like, how unique this space is? You've also let us borrow a very fancy mic so that we can present 360 stereo audio so that our, our listeners and viewers can, you know, experience being in the space as, as closely as we can approximate.

Cluett: Yeah, absolutely. It's subtle, and I hope that your viewers are wearing headphones.

Feltman: So how does this demonstration work?

Cluett: Okay, so in order to demonstrate how much of the sound the room absorbs, I'm gonna sing a sinusoid, a pure tone, straight ahead. You're gonna hear that as the loudest, most direct sound. I am not gonna change the volume of my sound at all, but I'm gonna turn around in a circle, and so as I turn you're gonna hear the room absorbing more and more of my sound.

Feltman: Okay.

Cluett: Okay.

[Starts singing and then stops to clear his throat.] Sorry, granola bar.

Feltman: [Laughs.] No worries.

Cluett: [Clears his throat and then starts singing while slowly moving in a circle.]

Feltman: That is wild.

Cluett: Yeah.

Feltman: So how does this one work?

Cluett: Okay, so one of the kind of miraculous things about an anechoic chamber is it allows you to hear something that you can't hear outside of the, of the chamber. And that's that for every doubling of distance a sound source has to the listener there's a cutting in half of the volume.

Feltman: Mm.

Cluett: And so, and so I'm gonna speak to you at this level, and then I'm gonna double the distance, and you're going to hear the same timbre, the same quality, the same emotional content as I'm talking now but just at half the volume. And then I'll double it again, and you'll hear even more of a falloff in the, in the volume.

Feltman: Cool.

Cluett: Okay, so this is me talking at the normal volume. And I'm going to move back double. [Moves backward.]

And this is me talking at that same volume; it's just half as loud for you. [Moves backward.]

And this is me talking at the same volume, and it's half as loud again.

Feltman: [Laughs.] Wow. Yeah, that is—it's very weird to have it be the, you know, the, the level of a whisper but not sound like one [laughs].

Feltman: So we're obviously recording a podcast and a video right now. What kinds of technologies were created here that make this kind of multimedia possible?

Cluett: It's kind of overwhelming, honestly. The “bit” of digital binary was invented here, and as an extension Claude Shannon and John Pierce invented pulse-code modulation, which is the way we record sound digitally. The charge-coupled device, the CCD, that captures video was invented here, the transistor—you know, the list goes on and on. Even The Jazz Singer, the first [feature-length] sound film [with synchronized sound for dialogue sequences] ...

Feltman: Mm.

Cluett: The technology for that was developed by Western Electric—Bell Labs, how Bell Labs was founded, making it possible for us to synchronize sound and image for film.

Feltman: And what kind of experiments have happened in this chamber since then?

Cluett: A kind of remarkable amount of things that touch our individual lives. Like, we think about the Touch-Tone phone ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Cluett: The “bop beep bop bop bop bip bop.” The individual tones and their tuning are optimized for memorizing phone numbers ...

Feltman: Mm.

Cluett: And the acoustic research paired with psychology, or what we call psychoacoustics, was done in this room in order to, you know, help people figure out how to memorize the most phone numbers as the nation's telephone grid got larger and larger ...

Feltman: Wow.

Cluett: And it wasn't just, you know, “Bronson 257,” right?

So in addition to that, you know, there was a, a fundamental research into synthesizing the sound of the human voice ...

Feltman: Mm.

Cluett: Right? We talk about microphone research and loudspeaker research, but that's not the entirety of it. Behind that is signal-processing research, that's about: How do you optimize a signal to go long-distance? And at first that was: How do you optimize a signal to go over a long run of copper wire, right? Reusing the telegraph system. And now in wireless: How do you, how do you encode a signal to minimize the amount of data taken up and maximize the quality of the voice?

You know, we think of science as being hard measurements and, and facts, and one of the things that's remarkable about Bell Labs in the, in the '60s and '70s was human-factors research, like: How does it feel to use technology?

Feltman: Mm.

Cluett: And one of the convincing things in telephony was: How do you make sure, as you're reducing the signal, that you're not throwing away emotion ...

Feltman: Mm.

Cluett: That you're not throwing away recognition, that you can still recognize the person that you love on the other end of the line? And I think one of the things that this room actually shows us, and the audio for this podcast will actually reveal a little, is that the digital silence in cell phones is, is actually really dehumanizing ...

Feltman: Mm.

Cluett: That, like, without the space around the signal, you, you lack context for the other person, and you're like, “Are you there? Are you there?” And—because the absolute digital silence makes you feel, you know, quite alone.

Feltman: Yeah, that's really interesting.

So I know that you are an artist-in-residence here.

Cluett: Mm-hmm.

Feltman: How did you get involved with the lab?

Cluett: Sure, so I've been here since 2017, so this is my eighth year in the artist-in-residence role. When I first arrived I came in as a re—as part of a reboot of the historical Experiments in Art and Technology program, which was founded in the 1960s. And then in 2014 there was a reboot of, of, like, the role of artistic research at Bell Labs in, in one form or another. And because so many media technologies intersect with scientific research, the idea was: Let's bring in artists, left-brain thinkers, to, to ask kind of divergent questions in a linear engineering space.

And so when I first came I was very active, moving lab to lab, asking questions of engineers and, and technical staff of what their research was and getting them to, to enter a dialogue to try to see what sort of divergent left-brain thinking might contribute to a kind of linear engineering research and development space.

Feltman: Awesome. So what kind of stuff have you been working on?

Cluett: So I've been really interested in what I'm calling “the last 10 percent,” which is, like, in psychoacoustic research so much of the things that we know about the sound world were developed either for telephony or for the military ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Cluett: So: Can we get a signal efficiently across a line, or can we triangulate something in space—so sonar and radar and those sorts of things? In virtual reality and in artificial intelligence, now the question is: How do we pass the kind of uncanny valley of, like, this is almost real, but it's not, right?

What I'm interested in is: What are the aspects of sound that are kind of soft factors, that are the human things that ...

Feltman: Mm.

Cluett: Make us feel like we're situated, that make us understand the context? The auditory equivalent of depth perception ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Cluett: Was something that was never, you know, looked at seriously in the initial sort of foundations research. And so I've been doing experiments around loudspeaker-array design and microphone-array design to try to think about what is hiding in the signal that our brain is processing that might not appear in the physical acoustics that give us a real sense of belonging—like, a sense of space. Like: “I am in this space, and, and, and it's me and my body, not just my mind.”

Feltman: Mm, and I know that in addition to the kind of experiments that have been done here to contribute to technological advancements, there's also been just sort of a lot of interesting art projects that have happened here ...

Cluett: Mm-hmm.

Feltman: What are some of the, like, stranger, more interesting things that have been done in this room?

Cluett: Sure. I mean, a lot of people don't realize that the first time a computer sang was at Bell Labs, right?

Feltman: Mm.

Cluett: So at the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey, when HAL is singing—is dying ...

Feltman: Yeah.

Cluett: And he sings, “Daisy ...”

[CLIP: HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey sings: “Daisy, Daisy / Give me your answer, do.”]

Cluett: That was heard by Arthur C. Clarke when he did a tour of Bell Labs ...

Feltman: Mm.

Cluett: And then was incorporated into the movie because it was the first time a computer sang, so the idea of giving the computer some human character came from trying to figure out speech-synthesis problems. Because if we could understand the nature of the way that speech was synthesized digitally, we could initiate the revolution of automated telephone answering, right ...

Feltman: Mm.

Cluett: Like, or the synthesized voices that AI responds with. All of that foundational research was done in spaces like this, and it was done first by asking a computer to sing.

Feltman: Very cool. And I know somebody brought a grand piano in here. We learned that as reassurance that the wire floor was not gonna give out underneath us [laughs].

Cluett: Yeah.

Feltman: What was that about? Because, you know, I feel like acoustically, this is objectively not great ...

Cluett: Mm.

Feltman: To make music in.

Cluett: I wasn't around for the grand-piano experiments, but at the start of my residency I—we had a artist-in-residence partner, collaborator, the International Contemporary Ensemble, and we brought a 12-person chamber orchestra into this room ...

Feltman: Mm.

Cluett: And a four-person orchestra—or, like, ensemble—into the adjacent room, and we were able to transmit the anechoic sounds, the sounds without reverberation ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Cluett: To an adjacent space and apply a new space in real time. So we could dial in Carnegie Hall ...

Feltman: Hmm.

Cluett: Or dial in an outdoor forest or dial in, you know, the best shower you've ever sung in, right? And so that ability to, like, “act” on signals that haven't yet been touched by space ...

Feltman: Mm.

Cluett: Helps us understand how to process the signals that give us a sense of, like, where sound is coming from.

Feltman: I feel like a lot of the sort of mainstream conversation about anechoic chambers is that it feels really freaky to be in them ...

Cluett: Mm, yeah.

Feltman: And you hear some, like, probably hyperbolic stories about, like ...

Cluett: Right.

Feltman: A sense of panic. Why is it that it feels so strange for us to be in here? And I'm also curious: How do you feel about being in the space?

Cluett: I love being in it.

Feltman: Yeah.

Cluett: You know, I think in an, in—like, we talk about the attention economy in that, like, we're all on our phones, and we've got earbuds in all the time, and we sleep to white noise, and we sleep to music. One of the remarkable things about this room, and the, you know, the people who are doing the recording around us right now are beginning to experience it, when you're in here for 20 minutes, your fight-or-flight response that's active all the time—like, if you step your foot off of a curb and you hear a bicycle messenger ding their bell and you pull your foot back automatically ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Cluett: That automatic retraction of your foot is happening because there's a, there's a, a jumper between your auditory cortex and your—and the part of your brain that's responsible for your physical motion, and it retracts your foot without you having to tell your foot to retract.

Feltman: Mm.

Cluett: The fact that it does that is because the brain is capable of that precognitive response because we're in a heightened mode of attention with our ears, and we ignore [roughly] 85 percent of the, of the sound of the world all the time. Otherwise, we'd be, you know, subject to the same kind of sensory-processing disorders that, that, you know, are so common, right? When you're in here for 20 minutes, the little hair cells on your basilar membrane inside of your ear relax, and it gets 10 percent quieter.

Feltman: Mm.

Cluett: And I think there's that moment where you're like, “Where's the stimulus? Where's the stimulus?” And that feels panicking, in the same way as, like, “Why hasn't anybody responded to my text?”

Feltman: Mm.

Cluett: And I think if you just—if you change your perception to a longer arc of, “Where is my body right now?” you start to realize, like, “My heart rate's lowered, lymphatic production slowed down. My breathing is, is slower.” And you can center into a kind of space that's really sort of unheard of in the 21st century.

I hold two roles: I'm the artist-in-residence at Nokia Bell Labs, and I'm the director of the historic Computer Music Center at Columbia University. And in both of those places I'm interested in the same thing: what I'm calling sort of “sensory computing” or “speculative acoustics.” Like, this idea that there's—there—it's important for computers to not just process text and language but for computers to understand the world around them with the same level of resolution that we do, right?

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Cluett: If we want to expect intelligence out of machines, we don't just know things from memorizing things off of—out of books and off the Internet. We know things by walking around the world. And so for me the intersection between engineering and, and the real world is this fascinating place where the resolution gets clearer and clearer the more you kind of attune the rest of the senses to catch up to our ability to process text, right, and vision, which has led the charge for so many years.

I think the solution to so many of the, of the questions of, like, what the next 100 years is going to feel like in terms of the way we interact with computers are gonna come down to how embodied we feel and then, as an extension, how safe we feel around the computer.

Feltman: So I understand that this facility is, is gonna be closing down in the next few years.

Cluett: Mm-hmm.

Feltman: What do you think you're, you're gonna take away from having worked in this space for as long as you have?

Cluett: I'm, I'm tempted to say something sort of profound about my own practice and, and, and its effect on my practice, which has been sort of immeasurable, right? Like, having the ability to record an absolutely dry audio for someone who composes electronic music is, like, unmeasurably positive, right?

But for me the real impact has been watching and leading dozens of school groups through, from elementary school through college, students from Harvard and students from Rutgers, students from Ramapo College and students from, from Carnegie Mellon, coming in and for the first time experiencing something absolutely new, right?

Feltman: Yeah.

Cluett: Like, that sense of awe at the kind of sublime—like, the reason we sit in front of mountains and stare at the ocean—this is just the same but for the absence of stimulus ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Cluett: And I think for a lot of people it's a real revelation that maybe, maybe technology writes on us a little bit too much, and it's time to kind of shake the Etch A Sketch gray and start writing over again.

Feltman: Well, thank you so much for taking the time to chat with us and for, you know, showing us around, telling us how this room works. It's been really cool.

Cluett: Yeah, it's my pleasure. Thank you. Thank you for having me.

Researchers are turning to artificial intelligence (AI) to help design the next generation of antibiotics to combat rising antimicrobial resistance. In minutes, AI can design thousands of chemical compounds with potential antibacterial properties, although there are hurdles to overcome before the first of these medicines can be tested in people.

Last week, the US Centers for Disease Control reported that rates of dangerous bacterial infections surged by 69% between 2019 and 2023. Enterobacterales bacteria, also called 'nightmare bacteria', are particularly difficult to treat with existing antibiotics. Globally, 1.1 million deaths a year are linked to bacterial resistance to antimicrobial drugs.

The standard method of antibiotic discovery involves going into nature and sifting through dirt to find antibacterial compounds, says César de la Fuente, a machine biologist at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. “That's really painstaking work that relies on trial and error, and it can take many years,” he adds. His team has been using AI to discover antibiotics for about a decade. The whole process of discovering a candidate, creating it in the laboratory and testing it in cells can be done “within a week or two”, he adds.

Most AI-designed antibiotics are still in early development. None has yet been tested in humans.

Machine learning and generative AI (genAI) can speed up the process. De la Fuente and his team train machine-learning algorithms by showing them compounds that can harm bacteria, and others that cannot. The AI designs antibiotics by looking for fragments of proteins with antibacterial properties in data sets that it has not seen before. These include the proteomes — the complete set of proteins that an organism can express — of animals, plants and bacteria.

GenAI algorithms — similar to the AI used in chatbots or image generators — are trained on the same data but designed to create new compounds. Earlier this month, de la Fuente and his team reported that their genAI model designed 50,000 peptides, or short chains of amino acids, that have antimicrobial properties and can destroy pathogens1. A deep-learning model then ranked these on the basis of how effective it thinks they might be at killing several bacteria types. Of the top 46 synthesized peptides, about 35 killed at least one bacterial strain in a dish, and most were not toxic to human embryonic kidney cells. The top two candidates were then tested and found to be effective against Acinetobacter baumannii in mouse models.

But making AI-designed antibiotics in the lab can be challenging. For example, bioengineer Jim Collins, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, has found that some AI-designed antibiotics are chemically unstable and cannot be synthesized. Others take too many steps to make and would be too costly and time-consuming to produce commercially.

ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation is widely used to meet the escalating need for organs. Current recipient-centric desensitization protocols involving antibody depletion through plasmapheresis increase the risk of infections, perioperative bleeding events and costs. Here we present a donor-centric desensitization protocol, converting type-A kidneys into enzyme-converted O kidneys during hypothermic perfusion to remove the A antigen from the kidneys. An ex vivo model resulted in no antibody-mediated injury. Encouraged by this, an enzyme-converted O kidney was transplanted into a type-O brain-dead recipient with a high titre of anti-A antibody, and no hyperacute rejection was observed. The graft was well tolerated with no evidence of antibody-mediated rejection for 2 days. Antibody-mediated lesions and complement deposition were found starting 3 days post-transplant, coinciding with A-antigen regeneration, and later higher Banff scores, suggesting an immune-mediated response. Single-cell sequencing confirms the elevated expression of accommodation-related genes, suggesting the potential for longer-term tolerance. This study provides a donor-centric organ engineering strategy and has the potential to broaden the reach of ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation, improving the fairness of and access to organ allocation.

In July 2024, a 7.4-magnitude earthquake struck Calama, Chile, damaging buildings and causing power outages.

The country has endured violent earthquakes, including the most powerful recorded in history: a 9.5-magnitude "megathrust" event that struck central Chile in 1960, causing a tsunami and killing between 1,000 to 6,000 people. However, the Calama quake was different from the megathrust quakes that are usually associated with the most destructive events in Chile and around the world.

Megathrust earthquakes occur at relatively shallow depths. But the Calama quake occurred much deeper underground, at 125 kilometers beneath the Earth's surface and within the tectonic slab itself.

Earthquakes this deep usually produce much more subdued shaking on the surface. But in the case of Calama, a sequence of events, discovered by researchers at The University of Texas at Austin, helped supercharge its strength. In a recent study in Nature Communications the researchers describe a newly-discovered chain of events that was responsible for increasing the earthquake's intensity.

In addition to helping explain the tectonic forces behind the powerful quake, the findings have implications for future earthquake hazard assessments.

"These Chilean events are causing more shaking than is normally expected from intermediate-depth earthquakes, and can be quite destructive," said the study's lead author Zhe Jia, a research assistant professor at the UT Jackson School of Geosciences. "Our goal is to learn more about how these earthquakes occur, so our research could support emergency response and long-term planning."

Intermediate-depth earthquakes, such as the one in Calama, were long thought to occur due to pressure building up as the rock dried out - a phenomenon called "dehydration embrittlement." This process happens when a subducting tectonic plate dives toward the Earth's hot interior, and the increased heat and pressure forces water out of the minerals within the rock. The dehydrated rocks are weakened and fractured, which can lead them to rupture - triggering an earthquake in the slab.

This dehydration process is typically thought to stop where temperatures exceed 650 degrees Celsius. But according to the researchers, the Calama quake was so powerful because it breached this limit - going 50 kilometers deeper into hotter zones through a second mechanism called "thermal runway." This involves immense friction from the initial slip generating a large amount of heat at the tip of the rupture, which helps weaken material around it and propels the rupture forward.

"It's the first time we saw an intermediate-depth earthquake break assumptions, rupturing from a cold zone into a really hot one, and traveling at much faster speeds," said Jia, who is part of the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics (UTIG), a research unit of the Jackson School. "That indicates the mechanism changed from dehydration embrittlement to thermal runaway."

To determine how the earthquake deformed and the extent of the rupture, the University of Texas team collaborated with researchers in Chile and the United States to integrate multiple types of analyses. This included analyzing seismic data from Chile that captured the rupture's propagation and speed, geopositioning data from the Global Navigation Satellite System to measure how the fault slipped, and computer simulations to estimate the temperature and composition where the earthquake ruptured.

"The fact that another large earthquake is overdue in Chile has motivated earthquake research and the deployment of multiple seismometers and geodetic stations to monitor earthquakes and how the crust is deforming in the region," said Thorsten Becker, a co-author of the study and a professor at the Jackson School's Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences and a senior research scientist at UTIG.

Becker and Jia said that learning more about how earthquakes occur at different depths could help with understanding what controls the size and nature of likely future events, which could help predict the degree of shaking and inform infrastructure planning, early warning systems, and rapid response systems.

The research was funded by the National Science Foundation, Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo (ANID), Chile, UC Open Seed Fund, Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, and the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics.

OpenAI has acquired Roi, an AI-powered personal finance app. In keeping with a recent trend in the AI industry, only the CEO is making the jump.  

Chief executive and co-founder Sujith Vishwajith announced the acquisition on Friday, and a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch he is the only one of Roi's four-person staff to join OpenAI. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The company will wind down operations and end its service to customers on October 15. 

The Roi deal marks the latest in a string of acqui-hires from OpenAI this year, including Context.ai, Crossing Minds, and Alex.

While it's not clear whether any of Roi's technology will transfer over to OpenAI or which unit Vishwajith will join, the acquisition clearly aligns with OpenAI's bet on personalization and life management as the next layer of AI products. Roi brings a specialized team that has already tried to solve personalization in finance at scale — a challenge whose lessons can be applied more broadly.   

New York-based Roi was founded in 2022 and has raised $3.6 million in early-stage funding from investors like Balaji Srinivasan, Spark Capital, Gradient Ventures, and Spacecadet Ventures, according to PitchBook data. Its mission was to aggregate a user's financial footprint, including stocks, crypto, DeFi, real-estate, and NFTs, into one app that can track funds, provide insights, and help people make trades.  

“We started Roi 3 years ago to make investing accessible to everyone by building the most personalized financial experience,” Vishwajith wrote in a post on X. “Along the way we realized personalization isn't just the future of finance. It's the future of software.” 

Beyond tracking trades, Roi gave users access to a financially savvy AI companion that responded in ways that made sense for them. When signing up, users could personalize Roi by providing information like what they do for a living and how they wanted Roi to respond to them. 

In one telling example that Roi posted on X, the sample user wrote: “Talk to me like I'm a Gen-Z kid with brain rot. Use as little words as possible and roast me as much as you want I don't mind.” In response to a query about the status of the user's portfolio, Roi replied: “Suje, you got cooked lil bro. Cause of the tariff announcements, you took an L today of $32,459.12…Based on your risk preference this might be an opportunity to buy the dip.” 

The exchange highlights the philosophy behind Roi and its co-founder — that software shouldn't just provide generic answers but should adapt, learn, and communicate in ways that feel personal, human, and most importantly, keep you engaged.  

As the Roi team wrote in a blog post: “The products we use every day won't remain static, predetermined experiences. They'll become adaptive, deeply personal companions that understand us, learn from us, and evolve with us.” 

That vision dovetails with OpenAI's existing consumer efforts, including Pulse, which generates personalized news and content reports for users as they sleep; the Sora app, a TikTok competitor filled with AI-generated content, including personal cameos from users; and Instant Checkout, a feature that lets users shop and make purchases directly in ChatGPT.  

The deal also comes as OpenAI beefs up its consumer applications team,  led by former Instacart CEO Fidji Simo. It's a further signal that OpenAI isn't just trying to be an API provider, but wants to build its own end-user apps. Roi's talent and tech could slot right into these apps and help make them more adaptive.  

Vishwajith, alongside his co-founder Chip Davis, used to work at Airbnb, where he developed a knack for optimizing user behavior to drive revenue. By his account, a simple change of 25 lines of code led to $10+ million in additional cash.  

Being able to bring in meaningful revenue via consumer apps is more important than ever to OpenAI as it continues to burn through billions on data centers and infrastructure to power its models.

Naveen Rao, who was formerly the head of artificial intelligence at Databricks, is in talks to raise $1 billion at a $5 billion valuation for a new startup, called Unconventional, Inc., that's building a new type of computer, according to four people familiar with discussions. 

Andreessen Horowitz has agreed to lead the investment, and Lightspeed and Lux Capital are also participating in the deal, two of the sources said, although none of those VC firms responded to our request for comment. Databricks is also said to be investing in Rao's new company, Bloomberg reported last month. 

Rao has already raised hundreds of millions and plans to begin building the startup without waiting for the full $1 billion round to close, our sources said. He plans to raise the rest of the capital in installments, a funding approach commonly referred to as a “tranched” round. 

Rao declined to comment, although he did publicly acknowledge the new startup on X last week, confirming its name and describing its hoped-for product as “rethinking the foundations of a computer to build a new substrate for intelligence that is as efficient as biology. Brain Scale Efficiency without the biological baggage!”

Hello world Unconventional, Inc.I've gotten a new company off the ground. It's a big swing…rethinking the foundations of a computer to build a new substrate for intelligence that is as efficient as biology. Brain Scale Efficiency without the biological baggage!We CAN do it.…

Databricks acquired Rao's previous startup, MosaicML in 2023, for $1.3 billion. Founded by Rao in 2020 with a focus on training and deploying large AI models, MosaicML raised $33.7 million from investors, including Lux Capital, DCVC, Playground Global, and Samsung Next, according to PitchBook. Prior to MosaicML, Rao co-founded the machine learning platform Nervana Systems, which Intel Corp. acquired in 2016 for reportedly more than $400 million. 

Rao, who spent over two years as VP of AI at Databricks (now valued at $100 billion and generating $4 billion in ARR), left the company last month to focus on his new startup, according to his LinkedIn profile and earlier reporting by Bloomberg.

Our sources say Rao's vision will essentially compete with Nvidia by designing a novel AI machine that includes both custom silicon chips and server infrastructure.

Shivaas Gulati is ready to build his next “big company,” and he's excited to do it in Seattle.

While he's keeping details close to the vest, the co-founder of digital remittance company Remitly told GeekWire this week that he's launching Arkero AI, a startup that aims to help sports organizations and the live events industry as a whole leverage artificial intelligence to their advantage.

Gulati said a lot of business owners are stuck on a key question: How do I use AI to unlock value in my business?

“I think we figured out that we can answer that question in novel ways,” he said. “We understand how they operate.”

A longtime angel investor, Gulati left Remitly in 2022, and for the past year he's been learning the intricacies of operating a sports venture as part of the ownership group of Southend United, which plays in the fifth tier of English football. For the past six months, he's also served as a technical advisor to Seattle Sounders FC helping the Major League Soccer club with its AI and tech strategy.

Arkero is the culmination of his learning about the industry and seeing it all from the inside. Specifically, he said his work with the Sounders allowed him to connect some of the dots on his latest venture “where I think we can create some interesting business value.”

Gulati is working on assembling a team and attracting investors. He said there are some “smart folks” that he's worked with previously who he is going to try to bring on board, and as a member of the board of Foundations, an organization to support startup founders, he's looking forward to building in Seattle. 

“Seattle is an amazing, talent-dense place for us,” he said. “It's a great place to build a company, and we're going to double down on that and build another big company here.”

Remitly was founded in 2011 and has grown to 2,800 employees at offices around the world, with more than 500 of them in a new and growing headquarters space in Seattle. Publicly traded on Nasdaq, Remitly now boasts a market value of $3.3 billion. 

Arkero is looking for what Gulati calls “AI native product builders.”

“It's this new breed of builders that we're seeing in the market who are really in the weeds with all the AI tools and using AI to create leverage for them,” he said. 

While he wasn't ready to share names yet, Gulati said he's creating an investor roster that includes some “big hitters and some team owners around the nation,” adding that he's fortunate to be in a position where investors want to back him again. Arkero has also attracted three initial design partners in the U.S. and England.

“I'm an entrepreneur at heart,” Gulati said. “Whether it's Southend or Remitly or my past ventures, I'm always building, lots of irons in the fire in different places. This is very energizing for me. I think ultimately it's the chance to solve another big problem, go after another exciting space.”

This worked nicely until the tensions in Europe lead to more cyberattacks rolling in and suddenly you have people not being able to buy food, medicine, and so forth. Not too long after, there was a government advisory urging people to keep some cash reserves in case a larger cyberattack happens, but cultural habits at large are hard to change. This is of course a coarse simplification of the context, but might help understand this incentive a bit better.

Are you sure this isn't impression you've gotten from isolated reactions involving a small number of individuals, perhaps just a single individual? I can't relate to the sentiment at all, having lived here for just over three decades and experiencing the popularity shift from cash to debit card. I can, in fact, not recall a single time ever that someone has divulged the opinion that they consider cash "dirty and criminal".More than anything else the Swede's favor of debit card is the convenience. Second to that I would say is the security of not immediately losing funds if you misplace the card or it being stolen - it feels less risky carrying a debit card, in particular if you're the type who prefers having more than a few "tens" on you in case you'd need or want to buy something.

This is what people think of when someone "uses cash". Not hauling tens of thousands to buy a used car or to settle the bill for having your bathroom tiled, which would be cases I too would raise an eyebrow over.

If a merchant tries to promote cash options I immediately think they're doing it for tax evasion reasons - not because of the touted reason that “card payments cost more to process” (they don't once you factor in the cost of handling cash).

I have barely used cash in 25 years. This doesn't mean anything at all. You're probably putting this solely in the context of using cash for significantly large purchases, e.g. higher 4 digit sum or above, or as in your example a craftsman who want to exempt it from his or her accounting. Nobody bats an eye at a person buying groceries, or some gadget for a couple of hundred, with cash.

Tradespeople sometimes request cash payment or provide a good discount for cash payments (well above any fee they would be charged). I guess where you are no one considers this dubious (really???) but at least in discussions with family the feeling is that the request for cash only payment is dubious.We also have a local retail establishment that is cash only. I think it's looked at dubiously.I personally have experienced it. Someone wanted to split payment on something between cash and a check so they could report the value of the item was lower because it would save them taxes every year. Again, the use of cash was I think a bit dubious.Note: Cash allows you to avoid all sorts of obligations (tax / family support / debt collection and garnishment etc etc), ineligiblity for banking (europe is pretty strict in some cases for example with folks with no legal status with banking) and is still used in things like the drug trade. Even if everyone around you considers large cash transactions reasonable that might be naivety or they may simply not have been exposed to larger cash transaction activity.I do like and carry cash.

When I joined my gamedev studio I had colleagues asking me why I had cash, and many of them didn't even recognise what it looked like (there was a switchover of the notes a year or two prior).There was an insinuation that I would use it for drugs. So, I suspect that the parent is right here.

I don't love the law, but having cash on its own is not grounds for seizure. Having expensive goods that you cannot explain how you managed to pay for is what they are targeting, according to your source.This is basically a law that takes your expensive shit away if you are too stupid to launder your ill-gotten cash.

By the way, have you ever wondered what the definition of "expensive goods" is? Of course, the powers that be want to make it all about the Rolexes and Lamborghinis, but a cursory peek at the actual law reveals [1]:> Section 4 If the property has been seized and the value of what may be confiscated does not exceed one tenth of the price base amount according to Chapter 2, Sections 6 and 7 of the Social Insurance Code, a question about confiscation of the property may be examined by 1. a police officer, or 2. another employee of the Police Authority or the Security Service appointed by the respective authority.Which effectively means that using the "price base amount" value of ~59k SEK in 2025, you are subject to asset forfeiture at the whims of any police officer once you have more than 600 bucks in your wallet or under the mattress.But I'm sure they will only use it on brown gang bangers or knife wielding foreign drunks and not law abiding citizens such as myself, so it's fine![1] https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-och-lagar/dokument/sven...

You said: "Sweden has introduced civil asset forfeiture where the mere possession of cash can make you a suspect." in a conversation about cash in Sweden, and posted an article about how there is a law that allows police to seize goods in certain circumstance.I pointed out that cash != luxury goods.I already said it was a law I don't agree with. But it also isn't a law that says that police can just take cash from you according to your sources . The section that you quoted doesn't seem to support your assertion about cash either, but I need the rest of the context.In reading the law it is allowed to seize cash under very specific circumstances, but simply possessing cash is not enough evidence to seize it.Cash seizure ("penningbeslag") can be used in an investigation concerning independent forfeiture ("utredning om självständigt förverkande").The initiation of an investigation and the use of "penningbeslag" are contingent on the "reason to assume that property originates from criminal activity." This implies that merely possessing cash, without any connection or suspicion of it being linked to criminal activity, would not be sufficient grounds for seizure under this law. There needs to be an antecedent suspicion that the cash is proceeds of crime.An investigation for independent forfeiture should be initiated "if there is reason to assume that property originates from criminal activity" (2 kap. 2 §). The purpose of such an investigation is to "investigate whether the property originates from criminal activity" (2 kap. 1 §).Therefore, the primary circumstance for cash seizure is when there is reason to believe that the cash originates from criminal activity.> You can put lipstick on a pig all you want, but if you reverse the burden of proof from "we have to prove your money is dirty" to "you have to prove your money is clean", that is a very clear cut case of "possessing cash is grounds for seizure" to me.Swedish law does not describe such a reversal for the initial act of seizure or investigation. As previously discussed, the law states: "En utredning om självständigt förverkande ska inledas om det finns anledning att anta att egendom härrör från brottslig verksamhet" (2 kap. 2 §). This means there must first be a "reason to assume" that the property (including cash) originates from criminal activity before an investigation is initiated and seizure measures like "penningbeslag" (cash seizure) are applied.> Section 4 If the property has been seized and the value of what may be confiscated does not exceed one tenth of the price base amount according to Chapter 2, Sections 6 and 7 of the Social Insurance Code, a question about confiscation of the property may be examined by 1. a police officer, or 2. another employee of the Police Authority or the Security Service appointed by the respective authority.This section, "Beslut om förverkande" (Decisions on forfeiture), discusses who can decide on the forfeiture of already seized property (beslag or penningbeslag) if its value is below a certain threshold. It pertains to the administrative decision to forfeit after the property has already been seized based on the criteria in 2 kap., not the criteria for the initial seizure itself.

Depends. Very long time ago I was approached by a group of seemingly friendly people asking for direction, then I felt sharp object to my belly and they told me to walk slowly towards cash point. They said they'll stab me if I don't withdraw all money I can. So I did. When cards were not popular, I would have small amount of cash in the wallet and anything more substantial hidden in a sock or elsewhere. Thieves would take what would be comfortable for me to lose. I guess it can be the same with cards - have a card with small amount and actual card hidden, but it is not as easy to hide as cash. Then you have whole other kettle of fish - banking apps. There's been instances of people being forced to do transfer at knifepoint. For that reason I don't use any apps, apart from throwaway bank account - again with small balance just in case. Shame more banks are restricting web access, which I think is most secure.

Just to reiterate how ubiquitous Swish and BankID are here: 99.9% of Swedish residents age 18-67 have BankID (8.6M users), while Swish has 8.7M private users, and 93% of those users send or receive money via Swish at least once per month.

Swish is the de facto standard for sending money between individuals [2], and that's what grandparents tend to use to send money to their grandchildren.  
It's fee-less (for person-to-person transfers use at least) and it connects your bank account with your phone number. So if anyone wants to send you money, they can just open Swish and enter your phone number (or scan a QR code) and send you some. You also have to sign the payment with the BankID app, which is the de facto standard for authentication [3].And when I write de facto standard I really mean it. 99.9% of Swedish residents age 18-67 have BankID (8.6M users), while Swish has 8.7M private users (93% of which use Swish at least once per month).[1] https://www.swedbank.se/privat/kort/bankkort/bankkort-master...[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swish_(payment)[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BankID_(Sweden)

it's really visa lobbying to destroy the (somehow worse than visa) easy credit new players. they give credit like candy because being online and low value only it's easier to avoid (or swallow) fraud.forcing their hand to accept offline sales mean they can't decide on the spot, and now those 5k credit lines which they only allow transactions for sub 100 purchases at a time will be wide open for offline fraud they can't detect, and which visa already know how to handle/sustain.this will probably be lobbied elsewhere soon. i predict Netherlands is next.

There is a pretty low charge limit compared to credit cards - I think Suica is limited to ¥20,000 for example. And now that Japan has fully embraced credit card touch payments, it is losing market share to Visa, Mastercard, etc.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FeliCa

> Mondex was a smart card electronic cash system, implemented as a stored-value card and owned by Mastercard.> Mondex allowed users to use its electronic card as they would with cash, enabling peer-to-peer offline transfers between cards, which did not need any authorization, via Mondex ATMs, computer card readers, personal 'wallets' and specialized telephones.

On planes they often accept credit cards even when there's no internet. I assume this is a trust in-credit-based system because they don't accept debit cards, i.e. if you are worth being trusted with a card you can have your sandwich now and we will take care of the bank processing once we are on the ground. So maybe this will be like we trust you enough with basic goods that once we get a connection things will be sorted out situation?

reply

The card has a variety of risk counters on it that allow it to securely decide whether an offline transaction can proceed, at least some of which are also exposed to the terminal which can have its own separate policy. I imagine internally the banks and payment gateways have a huge variety of internal related tuneables.

Calling a call centre to verify every transaction is too expensive so only purchases over certain limits came in following BofA/Visa - and that stated that way till the late eighties when larger stores started using back office to talk to Visa network etc. but even so the ability to do live updates and verification was too much and there were weird cacheing tricksSo banks could easily approve or be liable for transactions they would prefer not to approve - so they only gave credit to the rich at first, and then to those who paid back regularly. This info was shared and became credit reference agencies - because the credit card companies shared it initially like casinos but the abuse and mistakes brought legislationI think what i am saying is our consumer credit culture was not designed, it just grew.

IIRC, the merchant gets paid if hitting a credit limit or similar decline reason. The card holder then gets hit with a financial penalty (usurious interest rates, or extra charges). If the card has been stolen, it ends up in a big phonebook-like book for offline use (otherwise the merchant just called it in for big purchases).

And I guess if one has never seen these, I need to explain. In order to leave an impression on the carbon paper (I should probably explain that, too, huh?), a fair amount of pressure was needed (those old card imprinters didn't require a gym membership, but a child could not operate one). That rolling pressure would eventually wear on the surface of the card, and turn the numbers white when the outer layer wore through.

In the past embossed credit and debit cards were both accepted on planes. That's why they were embossed in the first place: for offline processing which in even more distant path was the only option. Later CC machines and offline chip/stripe transactions co-existed with online transactions.Normally (at least in Europe) you couldn't get an embossed card, even a debit one, without proving your credit worthiness. The possibility of offline transactions assumes overdraft — the same as with check books.When online transactions appeared, banks started to issue Visa Electron and Maestro cards which didn't work offline, could explicitly prohibit overdraft and were easier to get.But nowadays all boundaries gradually disappeared. Nothing is embossed, Visa Electron doesn't exist, bank issue debit cards with credit codes. It's all much simpler and more confusing at the same time.

reply

I wouldn't be so sure about that. In some payment situations you're asked whether you'd like to have the transaction go through as debit or as credit—so those two must be different somewhere. And probably in more than just a bit in a packet, as, for example, paying with debit Visas or MasterCards (normal ones, not Electron resp. Maestro) in the Netherlands (where locals almost universally have credit cards) is something of a crapshoot.

reply

Some payment providers ask up front to simplify the flows as it's not totally trivial to determine what sort of card it is, and also because different fees apply - historically some merchants added specific fees to basket etc. (less so nowadays but the UI convention sticks)

reply

And because the same card can be both. At least here in Brazil, most bank cards have multiple uses (credit, debit, ATM) in the same card. AFAIK, they're separate applications within the same chip, and the terminal has to select which one to use before starting.

reply

Edit: OK maybe there's different level of trust and some take a leap of faith :)  In my experience debit didn't work but it appears that its not the same everywhere.

reply

When a debit card prompts for a PIN, don't enter it, press submit, and it runs as credit instead of debit, but functionally works the same as far as the card-holder is concerned. It might take slightly longer to settle, and the merchant likely gets charged higher fees, but it works just fine. When I got my first debit card 20+ years ago my bank specifically told me to select credit and using it, instead of using it with the PIN as a debit card.These days I've noticed the systems tend to auto-prompt for the PIN instead of asking credit or debit. But skipping it functionally works the same as pressing credit used to.

I guess this is similar: how do you make trustworthy decisions that seem to inherently depend on the network, in the absence of a network? Before the internet, we had phonebooks instead of DNS, and we had cash instead of cards. Did the phonebook have every number? No. Was every piece of cash not counterfeit? No. But it's "good enough". Portable reference sources and tokens. The references are issued periodically and the tokens have evidence of exhaustion, their decay over time. A dog-eared dollar with a bunch of phone numbers on it, half-torn ... the merchant doesn't have to accept it.How do you do these things digitally? Periodic issue seems pretty straightforward ... if you have a network. Token issuance, similarly, needs at least occasional communication with other nodes in the network.So there's a local dwell capability.Is this part of the same reaction we saw with Denmark starting to have emergency stores within 50 km of every Dane? Is this motivated by a need to prepare for war?

Is this a typo where they meant to say “the offline function”?If I'm reading this right, the goal is to allow food, fuel, and medicine purchases with card + PIN in offline mode.Seems like a reasonable goal. I wonder what the technical details will look like. Will there be a periodically updated list of cancelled cards/accounts distributed to endpoints? Even a hashed list of all cards cancelled before their expiration date within a country is a reasonable amount of data for modern storage systems.Or would they simply rely on the ability to track down account owners by their originally registered contact info in the event that someone gets an invalid transaction through during an offline period?

It's already a thing, the EMVCo standard predates ubiquitous internet connectivity. Mass transit systems typically use it, airlines used to for in-flight purchases before the advent of reliable WiFi.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMV#Offline_data_authenticat...It is somewhat common to maintain a denylist of known fraudulent cards, but as you note the main mitigation is on the bank to track the card down. One of the key things you need to figure out with an offline payment system - and what I imagine is needed here - is a consensus on who has the liability for offline transactions and what the dollar limits are.

The UK already does this in some shops for low value items for NFC payments.     You can tell the offline transactions because they immediately say 'approved' rather than taking a few seconds.If it turns out the card approved something 'wrongly', for example because you had previously reported the card lost to the bank, then the bank refunds the transaction and claims the value back from the merchant.     That's why many merchants have their terminals set to require online payments.

Offline transactions mostly died off when the limit in the UK for contactless was raised to £100. At £20/30 (the original limits) issuers/merchants risk accept some payments not being valid (and the total limit before you had to chip and pin was fairly low top).And worth saying, the merchant has some control on the terminal but mostly the decision of offline/online is down to the issuer and configured on the card.

EMV (chip cards) can have a small amount of local smarts, so it is typical for example to insist on going online for a large transaction or if the card has performed too many offline transactions since last going online. The card maker decides these rules, so the bank gets to ensure the cards it issues to customers meet whatever requirements it has decided upon, balancing fraud risk against problems with loss of connectivity or services being down.So I doubt they'd bother doing some sort of ad hoc revocation technique.

Most of these reasons just sound like fee-issues to me. I use a debit card (or Swish) to pay for everything and there's never a cheaper payment option. The fact that checks somehow cost less to use than debit/credit cards sounds ridiculous tbh, especially with all the added handling that must go into dealing with them (it just seems so inefficient).

At least in the US, individual businesses don't like dealing with credit because of the transaction fees but are kind of forced to thanks to everybody else taking credit everywhere.Of course, the big chains love credit and are happy to pay the transaction cost because it lets them audit all the transactions and increase their control over local managers and employees.  Presumably, the big chains also negotiate lower fees.

imo, the mandate creates an interesting technical constraint on any CBDC standard, where the offline mode limits the effectiveness of a "turn off" of someone's money, as there will always be some feature where they can use their money to buy food and fuel.

For example, when each transaction is done, both parties might keep a cryptographic proof which they are required to submit once they are online again.Failing to submit could result in a small fine (to encourage submission) and double spending which can then be detected could result in a large fine (or even a prison sentence), for example.There is, perhaps, a privacy issue, just like with blockchain.

There's plenty of talk online about echo chambers and the way that certain ideas can get amplified when stuck in a silo of like-minded people. But the controversy earlier this year over American Eagle's “Good Jeans” advertising campaign featuring Sydney Sweeney is an example of how motivated political actors can pluck otherwise insulated discourse out of parts of social media and spin it into full-blown drama to serve their own means.

According to data collected by open-source social intelligence platform Open Measures, pushback against the American Eagle ad campaign, which was criticized as dabbling in eugenics and winking at white supremacists, was a relatively small part of the conversation surrounding the marketing effort. From July 16 to August 12, 2025, just 6% of posts mentioning the ad included mention of its perceived racist undertones. But if you caught wind of the discourse about it, you'd think it was the only thing anyone was talking about.

That, per Open Measures, is because right-wing accounts online spotted some of the backlash and turned it into the story. By July 27, the researchers found that conservative personalities started to boost selected posts to suggest that liberals were outraged by the ads. The accounts used this to generate backlash against what they painted as the entire Left crying “racism” about a jeans advertisement. But, as the New York Times reported in August, most of the posts that got presented as representative of a larger political ideology had fewer than 500 views before being amplified. Meanwhile, the amplification efforts were being done by accounts like LibsOfTikTok, which has 4.5 million followers on Twitter.

The ability to take these smaller accounts offering criticism and turn them into the stand-ins for the “woke left” allowed the Online Right to generate an entire news cycle about the advertisement and the supposed backlash against it, grabbing mainstream news coverage, including multiple segments on Fox News. The biggest period of conversation about the ad, according to Open Measures, wasn't the days following its launch, but rather about two weeks later, between July 30 and August 5, when the conservative amplification was at its highest—and culminating in President Donald Trump commenting on the whole situation and saying he “loved” the ad.

Open Measures further notes, “a larger share of posts discussing the ads that also claimed the ads echoed bigoted ideologies were represented on alt-platforms with predominantly conservative communities than those without, indicating that the claims were more popular with conservative critics of liberals than with liberals themselves.”

There were undoubtedly people levying real and genuine critiques of the American Eagle campaign, but the idea that those voices were somehow exemplary of the entirety of the Left simply doesn't match up to the data. The Right managed to take a handful of outliers, turn them into the representatives of something bigger, and then spin up an entire effort to push back against that narrative that it amplified in the first place.

The good news is that we can still write our Scala `val`s and `var`s (`const` and `let`) in the source code, enjoying good scoping and good performance.

There are some relatively simple heuristics where you can tell without escape analysis that a variable will not be referenced before initialization.The obviously bad constructions are references in the same scope that happen before the declaration. It'd be nice if these were an early errors, but alas, so keep the TDZ check. The next is any closed over reference that happens before the initializer. These may run before the initializer, so keep the TDZ check. Then you have hoisted closures even if they're after the initializer (eg, var and function keyword declarations). These might run before the initializer too.But everything else that comes after the initializer: access in the same or nested scope and access in closures in non-hoisted declarations, can't possibly run before the initializer and doesn't need the TDZ check.I believe this check is cheap enough to run during parsing. The reason for not pursuing it was that there wasn't a benchmark that showed TDZ checks were a problem. But TypeScript showed they were!

    function f() {
      return x; // Syntax parsing fails here.
    }
    let x = 4;
    return f();

you would get the equivalent of a ReferenceError for x when f() tried to use it (well, refer to it) at the commented line. But in JavaScript, this successfully returns 4, because `let` inherits the weird hoisting behavior of `var` and `function`. And it has to, because otherwise this would be really weird:    function f1() { return x; }
    let x = 4;
    function f2() { return x; }
    return Math.random() < 0.5 ? f1() : f2();

Would that have a 50/50 chance of returning the outer x? Would the engine have to swap which x is referred to in f1 when x gets initialized?TDZ is also terrible because the engines have to look up at runtime whether a lexical variable's binding has been initialized yet. This is one reason (perhaps the main reason?) why they're slower. You can't constant fold even a `const`, because `const v = 7` means at runtime "either 7 or nothing at all, not even null or undefined".In my opinion, TDZ was a mistake. (Not one I could have predicted at the time, so no shade to the designers.) The right thing to do when introducing let/const would have been to make any capture of a lexical variable disable hoisting of the containing function. So the example from the article (trimmed down a little)    return Math.random() < 0.5 ? useX() : 1;
    let x = 4;
    function useX() { return x; }

would raise a ReferenceError for `useX`, because it has not yet been declared at that point in the syntactic scope. Same with the similar    return Math.random() < 0.5 ? x : 1;
    let x = 4;

which in current JavaScript also either returns 1 or throws a ReferenceError. I'm not against hoisting functions, and removing function hoisting would have not been possible anyway. The thing is, that's not "just a function", that's a closure that is capturing something that doesn't exist yet. It's binding to something not in its lexical scope, an uninitialized slot in its static environment. That's a weird special case that has to be handled in the engine and considered in user code. It would be better to just disallow it. (And no, I don't think it would be a big deal for engines to detect that case. They already have to compute captures and bindings.)Sadly, it's too late now.

There are several examples in the blog, and only one is the first. It does not include the "terrible" descriptor after it. So your comment is kind of odd because it doesn't connect to the article at all.If you mean the first example that's described as "terrible", that's the second example and it's the one with the leaking loop variable. It kind of is terrible, Python has the same problem (and many others, Python scoping rules are not good). C used to have that problem but they at least had the good sense to fix it.

It basically means you can always override anything, which allows for monkey patching and proxying and adapter patterns and circular imports… These are all nasty things to accidentally encounter, but they can also be powerful tools when used deliberately.These hoisting tricks all play an important role in ensuring backwards compatibility. And they're the reason why JavaScript can have multiple versions of the same package while Python cannot.

It's much easier to reason about when your variables aren't going to escape past the end of the block.In non-GC languages going out of scope can also be a trigger to free the contents of the variable. This is useful for situations like locking where you can put the minimal span of code that requires the lock into a scope and take a lock which automatically unlocks at the end of the scope, for example.JavaScript's hoisting and scoping feel natural to people who started in JS, but most people who came from other languages find it surprising.

Why does the author say `calculation` and `i` are leaking? They're not even defined at that point (they come later in the code), and we're seeing “undefined” which, correct me if I'm wrong, is the JS way of saying “I have no idea what this thing is”. So where's the leakage?

It's "leaking" because the variable is in scope, it's associated value is "undefined". This is different than with let/const where the variable would not be in scope at that point in the function. An undefined value bound to a variable is not the same as "I have no idea what this thing is". That would be the reference errors seen with let/const.

> As of TypeScript 5.0, the project's output target was switched from es5 to es2018 as part of a transition to ECMAScript modules. This meant that TypeScript could rely on the emit for native (and often more-succinct) syntax supported between ES2015 and ES2018. One might expect that this would unconditionally make things faster, but surprise we encountered was a slowdown from using let and const natively!So they don't transpile to ES5, and that is the issue.1: https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/52924

They are only talking about one javascript engine (node). They didn't test any other engine or go into the implementation in node. For all we know, this might just be a poorly optimized code path in node that needs a little love, but the author didn't bother doing any investigation.Looking at the linked github issue, jsc doesn't have the performance penalty. It would have been interesting if the author had investigated why and shared that with us.

Shane Black has brought a lot of entertainment to Hollywood over the years, sometimes as an actor (he played Hawkins in 1987's Predator), but mostly as a filmmaker. He created the Lethal Weapon series, wrote The Monster Squad and The Long Kiss Good-Night, co-wrote and directed Iron Man 3, and more.

But 2018's The Predator, which he co-wrote and directed, misfired both in front of and behind the camera. It was especially disappointing for fans given his long history with the franchise.

Black aims to bounce back from The Predator with his current release, a thriller called Play Dirty. But he acknowledges that Dan Trachtenberg, the director who took up Predator after The Predator—and is now steering the entire franchise, with animated film Predator: Killer of Killers and Predator: Badlands releasing this year—deserves a lot of credit.

“Dan Trachtenberg saved that franchise,” Black told the Hollywood Reporter. “His work is impeccable. I saw Prey, and all I could do was say, ‘Sir, my hat's off.' That was a really great mythic take. I feel like an audience member now, and I'm just happy to see whatever he does. So, yeah, I'm happy that the franchise is still humming, as you say, and he's the right shepherd for it, at least for now.”

Predator: Badlands arrives November 7.

Rivian is changing the door handle design on its upcoming R2 SUV after employees and customers raised safety concerns, according to Bloomberg News. 

The automaker is one of many that has leaned into electronically latched door handles over the last few years. While this allows for sleeker presentation and more aerodynamic design, it often results in the automaker tucking the manual emergency door releases away in hard-to-find places.

On the R2, which comes out next year, Rivian will now put the interior manual releases in a “more clearly visible” location closer to the electrically powered door handles, Bloomberg reports.

The design change comes amid a wave of scrutiny around electronic door handles. Bloomberg recently published a report about Tesla owners and passengers getting stuck in their vehicles because of the company's hard-to-find manual releases. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation, and Tesla has since said it is redesigning how those work. 

Earlier this year, Ford issued a recall and stopped the sale of its Mustang Mach-E because its electronic latches could get stuck in a locked position if the car's 12-volt battery died.

Chinese company Highlander is building a server pod near Shanghai, where it will be submerged underwater to reduce the power consumption used by the facility for cooling. According to the South China Morning Post, Highlander is expected to sink the underwater pods in October. The servers will operate commercially, with state-owned institutions like China Telecom being among the first customers.

This isn't the first underwater data center project; Microsoft concluded its own experiment off the coast of Scotland in 2024. Although Microsoft said that it has learned a lot from the project, it did not proceed with a commercial deployment of the system.

On the other hand, China started its own underwater project in Hainan in 2023, and it is still active. The Shanghai project will be the second underwater center in the country, but it will be the first one to have clients.

The biggest benefit to using ocean water to cool data centers is the massive reduction in cooling costs. “Underwater operations have inherent advantages,” Highlander vice president Yang Ye told the Morning Post. Ye also said that it will reduce cooling energy consumption by around 90%. Highlander also said that 95% of its energy requirements will come from renewable sources, further reducing its carbon footprint.

There are also significant challenges that Highlander had to overcome. “The actual completion of the underwater data center involved greater construction challenges than initially expected,” said Engineer Zhou Jun, who worked at the Shanghai project.

Salt water and electronics do not mix well, so the company had to take special precautions to protect its systems. One technique Highlander uses involves a coating with glass flakes to protect the steel capsule from corrosion. It will also have an above-sea section that serves as an access point for maintenance crews.

Although placing data centers underwater will help reduce their power consumption, some experts are concerned about the effects of ocean warming due to continuous heat output. There hasn't been enough research on this, University of Hull Marine Ecologies Andrew Want told SCMP.

Nevertheless, the Highlander claims that an independent assessment of its test project showed that temperature changes were still within acceptable limits. But as data centers expand and hit megawatt- and gigawatt-scales, thermal pollution will become an increasingly serious matter.

Speaking by video at the UN Climate Summit in New York last week, China's president Xi Jinping laid out his country's climate ambitions. While the stated goals may not have been aggressive as some environmentalists would like, Xi at least reaffirmed China's green commitment.

“Despite some countries going against the trend, the international community should stay on the right track, maintain unwavering confidence, unwavering action, and undiminished efforts,” he said. Any reference to Donald Trump and the United States was surely intended (though not explicit).

The march of the energy transition is a long one, but it has to start somewhere. And with this approach, China has already taken quite a few steps.

Today, there is no race to be a climate leader. The world is a far fry from the COP26 conference in November 2021, when tackling the threat of climate change seemed like a global priority. A few months later, Russia invaded Ukraine; the ensuing energy crisis and inflation kicked climate off of many political agendas.

While Joe Biden and the United States responded to soaring prices with the Inflation Reduction Act, which prioritized investment in renewable energy, Donald Trump subsequently withdrew the US from the Paris Agreement—an international accord to limit global warming—for the second time. The European Union has also stuttered: Too internally divided, it did not go beyond a drab declaration of intent at the UN Climate Summit. There hasn't been much movement from India, a country of nearly 1.5 billion people. And other nations' emissions are simply too small to matter.

Given this background, it becomes easy to understand how, in this scenario, China has become a global leader in the clean energy transition. Xi's speech did not go into much detail, but it did mention all the main points of China's strategy.

In New York, Xi acknowledged the importance of the transition, and for the first time, agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions rather than simply promise to slow them down. China's stated goal is between 7 percent and 10 percent reduction by 2035.

How do you evaluate these pledges? While the commitment is vague, it's still significant; previously the regime had merely promised to reach peak emissions by 2030, tying the cuts to economic growth. In Xi's speech you can seen China transition from a developing country approach to a role more akin to that of industrialized countries, whose emissions have been declining for decades.

It should be pointed out that reducing emissions at the pace promised by Beijing means a decline of about 1 percent a year. According to an analysis by William Lamb of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, this is a slower pace than that held by most industrialized nations. Italy, for example, has reduced them by an average of 3.2 percent every 12 months since their peak in 2006; the United Kingdom by an average of 2.8 percent since 2004; France by 2.3 percent.

“China has often promised little and achieved much,” notes Andreas Sieber, associate director for policy and campaigns for the global climate nonprofit 350.org, suggesting that China might overdeliver. The country's lack of democracy also means its policies are not at risk of reversal every election cycle.

Xi Jinping's speech included a commitment to reach 3,600 gigawatts (GW) of installed wind and solar capacity by 2035, six times the country's 2020 figures. This is already the leading country in terms of installed renewable power, and a giant on the technology front as well, with universities churning out environmental and climate tech research at full speed, and attracting scientists from abroad across numerous fields. He also announced a commitment to an energy mix with more than 30 percent renewables.

Mobility has long been an issue for China, which has moved from bicycles, ubiquitous until the 1990s, to the mass automobile. The images of the 2008 Beijing Olympics are unforgettable: A blanket of smog buried the city. The government has in recent years given a strong boost to electric mobility: At the Climate Summit it announced plans to make EVs “mainstream,” that is, prevalent in sales. It helps that it has ready access to rare earth minerals that are essential for building batteries. And for that matter, the country hosts giant automotive companies like BYD and Catl, which supplies batteries to some 50 global brands including Tesla and Volkswagen.

Xi has declared his intention to expand the national carbon emission trading market to more emission-intensive sectors than today.

China made additional commitments on forests, which it says will reach an extent of 34 billion cubic meters.

To skeptics expecting broader measures and the mantle of true global leadership from China, well, that's not a particularly coveted title these days—especially if the US continues to reverse course on climate science. As senior advisor Bernice Lee of the think tank Chatham House notes, China invested $625 billion in the clean energy transition last year alone; that's nearly a third of the gobal total.

Not only that: Research and massive adoption of renewable technologies have led to the dramatic drop in prices, and China's very large domestic market is a formidable driver in this regard. "The rise of Chinese renewables is reshaping the global economy and replacing coal in the domestic market," Lee says.

The hope is that other countries, reassured by that commitment, will follow China's example rather than America's.

Once-cheap SSDs, DRAM, and HDD prices are climbing fast as AI demand and constrained supply converge to create the tightest market in years.

Nearly every analyst firm and memory maker is now warning of looming shortages of NAND and DRAM that will result in skyrocketing pricing for SSDs and memory over the coming months and years, with some even predicting a shortage that will last a decade. The looming shortages are becoming increasingly impossible to ignore, and the warnings from the industry are growing increasingly dire, as the voracious appetite of AI data centers begins to consume the lion's share of the world's memory and flash production capacity.

For the better part of two years, storage upgrades have been a rare bright spot for PC builders. SSD prices cratered to all-time lows in 2023, with high-performance NVMe drives selling for little more than the cost of a modest mechanical hard disk. DRAM followed a similar trajectory, dropping to price points not seen in nearly a decade. In 2024, the pendulum swung firmly in the other direction, with prices for both NAND flash and DRAM starting to climb.

The shift has its roots in the cyclical nature of memory manufacturing, but is amplified this time by the extraordinary demands of AI and hyperscalers. The result is a broad supply squeeze that touches every corner of the industry. From consumer SSDs and DDR4 kits to enterprise storage arrays and bulk HDD shipments, there's a singular throughline: costs are moving upward in a convergence that the market has not seen in years.

The downturn of 2022 and early 2023 left memory makers in dire straits. Both NAND and DRAM were selling below cost, and inventories piled up. Manufacturers responded with drastic output cuts to stem the bleeding. By the second half of 2023, those reductions had worked their way through to sales channels. NAND spot prices for 512Gb TLC parts, which had fallen to record lows, rose by more than 100% in the span of six months, and contract pricing followed.

That rebound quickly showed up on retail shelves. Western Digital's 2TB Black SN850X sold for upwards of $150 in early 2024, while Samsung's 990 Pro 2TB went from a holiday low of around $120 to more than $175 within the same timeframe.

The DRAM market's trend lagged behind NAND by a quarter, but the pattern was the same. DDR4 modules, which appeared to be clearance items in 2023, experienced a supply crunch as production lines began to wind down. Forecasts for Q3 2025's PC-grade DDR4 products were set to jump by 38-43% quarter-over-quarter, with server DDR4 close behind at 28-33%. Even the graphics memory market began to strain. Vendors shifted to GDDR7 for next-generation GPUs, and shortfalls in GDDR6 sales inflated prices by around 30%. DDR5, still the mainstream ramp, rose more modestly but showed a clear upward slope.

Hard drives faced their own constraints. Western Digital notified partners in April 2024 that it would increase HDD prices by 5-10% in response to limited supply. Meanwhile, TrendForce recently identified a shortage in nearline HDDs, the high-capacity models used in data centers. That shortage redirected some workloads toward flash, tightening NAND supply further.

 




Every memory cycle has a trigger, or a series of triggers. In past years, it was the arrival of smartphones, then solid-state notebooks, then cloud storage. This time, the main driver of demand is AI. Training and deploying large language models require vast amounts of memory and storage, and each GPU node in a training cluster can consume hundreds of gigabytes of DRAM and multiple terabytes of flash storage. Within large-scale data centers, the numbers are staggering.

OpenAI's “Stargate” project has recently signed an agreement with Samsung and SK hynix for up to 900,000 wafers of DRAM per month. That figure alone would account for close to 40% of global DRAM output. Whether the full allocation is realized or not, the fact that such a deal even exists shows how aggressively AI firms are locking in supply at an enormous scale.

Cloud service providers are behaving similarly. High-density NAND products are effectively sold out months in advance. Samsung's next-generation V9 NAND is already nearly booked before it's even launched. Micron has presold almost all of its High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) output through 2026. Contracts that once covered a quarter now span years, with hyperscalers buying directly at the source.

The knock-on effects are visible at the consumer level. Raspberry Pi, which had stockpiled memory during the downturn, was forced to raise prices in October 2025 due to memory costs. The 4GB versions of its Compute Module 4 and 5 increased by $5, while the 8GB models rose by $10. Eben Upton, the company's CEO, noted that “memory costs roughly 120% more than it did a year ago,” in an official statement on the Raspberry Pi website. Seemingly, nothing and no one can escape the surge in pricing.

A shortage is not simply a matter of demand rising too quickly. Supply is also being redirected. Over the past decade, NAND and DRAM makers learned that unchecked production expansion usually leads to collapse. After each boom, the subsequent oversupply destroyed margins, so the response this cycle has been more restrained.

Samsung, SK hynix, and Micron have all diverted capital expenditure toward HBM and advanced nodes. HBM, in particular, commands exceptional margins, making it an obvious priority. Micron's entire 2026 HBM output is already committed, and every wafer devoted to HBM is one not available for DRAM. The same is true for NAND, where engineering effort and production are concentrated on 3D QLC NAND for enterprise customers.

According to the CEO of Phison Electronics, Taiwan's largest NAND controller company, it's this redirection of capital expenditure that will cause tight supply for, he claims, the next decade.

“NAND will face severe shortages in the next year. I think supply will be tight for the next ten years,” he said in a recent interview. When asked why, he said, “Two reasons. First… every time flash makers invested more, prices collapsed, and they never recouped their investments… Then in 2023, Micron and SK hynix redirected huge capex into HBM because the margins were so attractive, leaving even less investment for flash.”

 




It's these actions that are squeezing more mainstream products even tighter. DDR4 is being wound down faster than demand is tapering. Meanwhile, TLC NAND, once abundant, is also being rationed as manufacturers allocate their resources where the money is, leaving older but still essential segments undersupplied.

The same story is playing out in storage. For the first time, NAND flash and HDDs are both constrained at once. Historically, when one was expensive, the other provided a release valve, but training large models involves ingesting petabytes of data, and all of it has to live somewhere. That “warm” data usually sits on nearline HDDs in data centers, but demand is now so high that lead times for top-capacity drives have stretched beyond a year.

With nearline HDDs scarce, some hyperscalers are accelerating the deployment of QLC flash arrays. That solves one bottleneck, but creates another, pushing demand pressure back onto NAND supply chains. For the first time, SSDs are being adopted at scale for roles where cost-per-gigabyte once excluded them. The result is a squeeze from both sides, with HDD prices rising because of supply limits and SSD prices firming as cloud buyers step in to fill the gap.

 




Fabs are being built, but they're expensive and take a long time to get up and running, especially in the U.S. A new greenfield memory fab comes with a price tag in the tens of billions, and requires several years before volume production. Even expansions of existing lines take months of tool installation and calibration, with equipment suppliers such as ASML and Applied Materials struggling with major backlogs.

Manufacturers also remain wary of repeating past mistakes. If demand cools or procurement pauses after stockpiling, an overbuilt market could send prices tumbling. The scars of 2019 and 2022 are still fresh in their minds. This makes companies reluctant to bet on long-term cycles, even as AI demand looks insatiable today — after all, many believe that we're witnessing an AI bubble.

Geopolitics adds yet more complexity to the conundrum. Export controls on advanced lithography equipment and restrictions on rare earth elements complicate any potential HDD fab expansion plans. These storage drives rely on Neodymium magnets, one of the most sought-after types of rare earth materials. HDDs are one of the single-largest users of rare earth magnets in the world, and China currently dominates the production of these rare earth materials. The country has recently restricted the supply of magnets as a retaliatory action against the U.S. in the ongoing trade war between the two nations.

Even if the capital were available, the supply chain for the required tools and materials is itself constrained. Talent shortages in semiconductor engineering slow the process even further. The net result is deliberate discipline, with manufacturers choosing to sell existing supply at higher margins rather than risk another collapse.

 




Unfortunately, manufacturers' approaches to the matter are unlikely to change any time soon. For consumers, this puts an end to ultra-cheap PC upgrades, while enterprise customers will need larger infrastructure budgets. Storage arrays, servers, and GPU clusters all require more memory at a higher cost, and many hyperscalers make their own SSDs using custom controllers from several vendors. Larger companies, like Pure Storage, procure NAND in massive quantities for all flash arrays that power AI data centers. Some hyperscalers have already adjusted by reserving supply years in advance. Smaller operators without that leverage face longer lead times and steeper bills.

Flexibility is reduced in both cases. Consumers can delay an upgrade or accept smaller capacities, but the broader effect is to slow the adoption of high-capacity drives and larger memory footprints. Enterprises have little choice but to absorb costs, given the critical role of memory in AI and cloud workloads.

The market should eventually rebalance, but it's impossible to predict when. New fabs are under construction, supported by government incentives, and if demand growth moderates or procurement pauses, the cycle could shift back toward oversupply.

Until then, prices for NAND flash, DRAM, and HDDs will likely remain elevated into 2026. Enterprise buyers will continue to command priority, leaving consumers to compete for what remains. And the seasonal price dips we took for granted in the years gone by probably won't be returning any time soon.

President Donald Trump posted some new videos to Truth Social late Thursday, continuing his tradition of pushing out the most bizarre content ever distributed by a U.S. president. One of the videos was AI-generated and features OMB Director Russ Vought as the Grim Reaper… and President Trump playing a cowbell.

The video, posted around 10:40 p.m. ET, is set to a parody version of Blue Öyster Cult's 1976 hit song “Don't Fear the Reaper” and opens with a stormy rendering of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., including figures draped in long black robes.

One of the figures is revealed to be President Trump, hitting a cowbell that doesn't sync to the music in any way, while another is Russ Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget. Vought was a key architect of Project 2025, the conservative plan to gut the federal government, which Trump and his allies tried to pretend wasn't actually Trump's plan during the 2024 presidential campaign.

“Now their time has come. Here, the power's gone,” the song opens with a shot of the Capitol. “Russ Vought is the Reaper. He wields the pen, the funds and the brain.”

The song goes on, describing Democrats as “babies” and showing Vought as the man who will make devastating cuts to the federal workforce. Two sombreros also appear, something that's become a bit of a meme on the racist right.

The idea is that Democrats have shut down the government because they want to give health care money to undocumented immigrants, something that's not true but has been repeated incessantly by Trump and his allies in Congress. The government shutdown is on day three, and there's no end in sight, as the Republicans control both the House and Senate.

The video posted by Trump appears to have been produced by the Dilley Meme Team, a collective of online video creators founded by Brenden Dilley. The group makes pro-Trump content and dabbles in the promotion of QAnon, the conspiracy theory that Trump and the Republicans are secretly working against a cabal of baby-eating predators in the Democratic Party. Yet this new video doesn't exactly cast Trump and his allies as the guys coming in to save the day.

Honestly, Vought as the Reaper is probably a fair representation of his goals. Shortly before the 2024 presidential election, Vought said he wanted to cause federal workers trauma, and that's precisely what the administration has been doing, long before the government shutdown.

“We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected,” Vought said in 2024, according to a video obtained by ProPublica. “When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work because they are increasingly viewed as the villains.”

Obviously, a video depicting Vought as the Grim Reaper casts him as the villain in the eyes of most people. But that's really beside the point. Far-right politicians increasingly seem confused about who counts as the good guys.

“We want their funding to be shut down so that the EPA can't do all of the rules against our energy industry because they have no bandwidth financially to do so. We want to put them in trauma,” Vought continued.

But all of the threats that Vought has been making aren't so intimidating now. Trump has unilaterally cut the federal workforce and funding for programs both at home and abroad, with devastating consequences. After the past nine months of Trump taking a chainsaw to the federal government (often with the help of Elon Musk and DOGE), there's a real question of how much more they can cut.

There's also the question of whether Trump even knows what's being posted to his social media accounts and what kinds of unhinged AI-generated content might be next. The president posted an AI video of himself last weekend promoting something called “med beds,” a QAnon-adjacent conspiracy theory that magical beds can cure all disease but are being suppressed by the pharmaceutical industry.

Trump also posted an AI video Thursday night showing him throwing a “Trump 2028” hat on the head of Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the top-ranking Democrat in the House.

The video has some subtle clues that it might be AI, including just the fact that Trump wouldn't be coordinated enough to pull off tossing a hat like that, but it's going to get increasingly harder to tell what's fake in our current environment. OpenAI launched a Sora app this week that makes extremely realistic-looking AI video content. And while it's invite-only right now, the tools to make very convincing fakes are becoming more commonplace.

Trump and his allies aren't serious people, even if they control all the levers of power. And a reporter asked Speaker of the House Mike Johnson about the way that his party trolls Democrats with these ridiculous videos.

“What they're trying to have fun with, trying to make light of, is to point out the absurdity of the Democrats' position. And they're using memes and all the tools of social media to do that,” Johnson said.

“Some people find that entertaining, but at the end of the day, the decisions are hard ones, and I'm telling you, they're not taking any pleasure in that.”

The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Association (PNWH2), a multi-state hub launched to establish a hydrogen economy, lost $1 billion of federal funding in cuts announced yesterday by the Trump administration. 

The initiative was one of seven regional hydrogen hubs selected two years ago by the U.S. Department of Energy. The program's goal was to kick-start the nascent hydrogen fuel sector, which aimed to provide clean energy for fossil-fuel intensive sectors including steel and cement manufacturing and long-distance transportation such as shipping and heavy-duty trucking. 

Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., called the cancellation “unprecedented and corrupt” and said it would  wipe out more than 10,000 jobs based mostly in rural areas.

“Our region was awarded this Hub following an intensive national competition because we showed we had the pioneering researchers, clean energy resources, and over $5 billion in committed local investment that it would take to show that clean hydrogen can work,” Cantwell said in a statement. 

Clean or “green” hydrogen fuel is made by splitting water to create hydrogen and oxygen, using a process called electrolysis. For the fuel to be climate friendly, the electrolysis needs to be powered with clean energy, such as solar, wind or hydroelectric dams. Hydrogen has predominantly been made by pyrolysis from sources like methane, but that fuel typically is less clean. 

Burning hydrogen creates water as its main emission.

DOE defended the cuts, stating that the projects “did not adequately advance the nation's energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

The cancellations were centered on blue-leaning states and included California, Oregon, Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, New Mexico, New York, New Jersey and multiple New England states. The DOE said award recipients had 30 days to appeal the cancellations and that some had begun that process.

“Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left's climate agenda is being cancelled,” said Russ Vought, director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, in a post on X.  

Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson defended the regional hub and its associated benefits. 

“These projects will lower costs, create jobs, and reduce air pollution. We're working with the Attorney General's Office to fight this illegal action,” he said in a statement. 

The governor's office listed Washington programs being cut:

In addition to the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Association — which spanned Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana — the other six DOE hubs were based in California, Appalachia, Texas, the MidAtlantic, the Midwest and a hub including Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota.

Washington state has multiple companies developing or using hydrogen technologies. 

Chris Green, president of the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Association, said that despite the cuts, the sector will continue.

“The progress we made over the past year — deepening partnerships, supporting investment, and promoting the innovation and infrastructure needed to keep hydrogen at the forefront of America's energy future — has created lasting momentum,” Green said on LinkedIn.

In-depth Amazon coverage from the tech giant's hometown, including e-commerce, AWS, Amazon Prime, Alexa, logistics, devices, and more.

Those boxy, white, electric delivery vans you may be seeing on the streets of Seattle are being used to deliver Amazon packages.

GeekWire spotted one of General Motors' BrightDrop vans in the Ballard neighborhood this week and got an up-close look at the exterior and interior of the vehicle.

Independent Delivery Service Partners (DSP), who deliver packages in Amazon Prime-branded uniforms and vehicles, are using some of the BrightDrop vehicles. DSPs can choose to secure vehicles through rentals or other means as part of their work, according to Amazon.

Bloomberg reported last month that Amazon is separately testing about a dozen of the vans. The tech giant acquired a small number of the vehicles in 2023, according to a GM spokesperson. The pilot is reportedly aimed at exploring additional EV options for Amazon's delivery fleet, which includes vans made by Rivian.

“We're committed to having 100,000 electric delivery vehicles on the road by 2030, and we regularly test various vehicle options — including a small number of Chevrolet BrightDrops in our fleet,” Amazon spokesperson Steve Kelly previously told Bloomberg.

Amazon began rolling out electric delivery vans in summer 2022 as part of its Climate Pledge commitment to achieve net-zero carbon emissions across global operations by 2040. The company said in June that it had more than 25,000 electric Rivian vans on the road across the U.S.

The white vans are a stark contrast to the blue Amazon-branded fleet that usually includes the Prime logo and a quirky slogan splashed on the sides and back.

A blue-vested DSP driver behind the wheel told GeekWire he was enjoying driving the BrightDrop as he streamed his music through a large, center “infotainment” display. The back of the van featured no shelving, so packages were scattered on the floor of the van. The driver also said there was no AI-equipped Amazon safety camera installed in the front cab — and he liked that.

Update: This story has been updated to reflect that the vans are not part of Amazon's test.

This mouse has ears.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A group of researchers from the University of California, Irvine, have developed a way to use the sensors in high-quality optical mice to capture subtle vibrations and convert them into audible data. According to the abstract of Mic-E-Mouse, the high polling rate and sensitivity of high-performance optical mice pick up acoustic vibrations from the surface where they sit. By running the raw data through signal processing and machine learning techniques, the team could hear what the user was saying through their desk.

Mouse sensors with a 20,000 DPI or higher are vulnerable to this attack. And with the best gaming mice becoming more affordable annually, even relatively affordable peripherals are at risk. It all begins when a user has a mouse like this attached to a compromised computer.

Note that this compromise does not necessarily mean a complicated virus installed through a backdoor — it can be as simple as an infected FOSS that requires high-frequency mouse data, like creative apps or video games. This means it's not unusual for the software to gather this data. From there, the collected raw data can be extracted from the target computer and processed off-site. "With only a vulnerable mouse, and a victim's computer running compromised or even benign software (in the case of a web-based attack surface), we show that it is possible to collect mouse packet data and extract audio waveforms," the researchers state.

The processing works like this: the raw audio data is run through digital signal processing using a Wiener Filter, where you can start to hear some information. This is then further cleared up through a neural model, giving the researchers clear audio.

Although this is a novel method for extracting audio from unsuspecting targets, it's not exactly the first time that someone has attempted to covertly record targets. One famous example from the Cold War was when the KGB gifted the American ambassador in Moscow a replica of the Great Seal with an embedded passive microphone. It only activated when it was hit by a high-frequency radio signal, leaving it undetected for nearly seven years.

The concept of the Mic-E-Mouse is similar — using an unsuspecting device to capture audio data. However, this method is empowered by AI models, allowing the researchers to get a speech recognition accuracy of about 42 to 61%, effectively turning your mouse into an eavesdropping microphone, though.

The proof of concept is certainly unnerving, but it will hopefully prompt future steps taken to prevent this sort of acoustic privacy violation, the kind that would have been unthinkable in a world before AI.

Apple removed an app that allows immigrants to track Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity on Thursday night.

ICEBlock, an app that was launched in response to President Trump's anti-immigrant crackdown, was modeled after Google's crowdsourced traffic app Waze, and it gave users a crowdsourced way to report nearby ICE activity.

“We just received a message from Apple's App Review that #ICEBlock has been removed from the App Store due to ‘objectionable content'. The only thing we can imagine is this is due to pressure from the Trump Admin. We have responded and we'll fight this! #resist,” ICEBlock said in a post on Bluesky.

ICEBlock received intense backlash from Trump administration officials earlier this year. ICE Acting Director Todd M. Lyons claimed that the app “basically paints a target on federal law enforcement officers' backs,” in a press statement from June.

Attorney General Pam Bondi is now taking credit for the removal, telling Fox News that her office reached out to Apple to demand they remove the app

Earlier this summer, Bondi also went on Fox News to openly threaten ICEBlock's founder Joshua Aaron. “We are looking at him,” she said. “And he better watch out.” Around that time, Bondi also said that she wanted to prosecute CNN for airing a segment on the app.

Acting director of ICE's removal operations, Marcos Charles, also suggested ICEBlock and similar ICE tracking apps were used in the fatal shooting at an ICE facility in Dallas, although the shooter would have known the location of the facility without a tracker app.

“I am incredibly disappointed by Apple's actions today. Capitulating to an authoritarian regime is never the right move,” Aaron told 404 Media. “This is protected speech under the first amendment of the United States Constitution.”

“Information provided to Apple by law enforcement show that your app violates Guideline 1.1.1 because its purpose is to provide a location information about law enforcement officers that can be used to harm such officers individually or as a group,” Apple's email to Aaron read, according to 404 Media.

In 2019, Apple removed a similar crowdsourced app that allowed users to track Hong Kong police movements amidst the Hong Kong protests that were marked by police brutality. At the time, numerous Republican lawmakers were quick to criticize the decision and deem it censorship.

“American companies should never be censored or told what to by foreign adversaries,” Republican Florida senator Rick Scott tweeted at the time.

ICEBlock was number one on the App Store over the summer as the Trump administration ramped up its policy of mass deportations and ICE raids, as part of the President's campaign promise to enact the “largest deportation” in U.S. history.

“In recent years, ICE has faced criticism for alleged civil rights abuses and failures to adhere to constitutional principles and due process, making it crucial for communities to stay informed about its operations,” ICEBlock's website writes to explain why the app exists.

The app insists that it's completely anonymous, but that claim has been contested. ICEBlock, the app does not keep a database of user activity, but a database of downloads is available on Apple, and it's likely that Apple also tracks device registrations for push notifications, according to the founders of other privacy-focused apps who spoke to The Verge about it earlier this year. On the other hand, a third-party security researcher has corroborated ICEBlock's claims of total privacy and anonymity.

The app was available exclusively for iOS devices, so it's now unclear what the future holds for ICEBlock and its users.

Forget about Greek yogurt. Ant yogurt is really where it's at. And you can trust the recipe, because it's backed by both Michelin chefs and expert microbiologists.

An iScience paper published today describes how researchers replicated a nearly forgotten yogurt recipe from Bulgaria—an oral tradition with all the ingredients you'd expect from yogurt, except for one: a handful of ants. Essentially, acidic compounds that ants carry for self-defense help drive a unique fermentation process for the milk proteins in a pre-yogurt-ified state. The resulting yogurt tastes surprisingly normal, with a “slightly tangy taste with mild herbaceousness and pronounced flavors of grass-fed fat,” according to the researchers.

“Every seemingly small detail actually had an impact on the safety and flavor of the resulting yogurts, highlighting the wisdom embedded in the traditions,” Leonie J. Jahn, study senior author and a microbiologist at the Technical University of Denmark, told Gizmodo.

Incidentally, the project emerged from a series of oral discussions—just like the recipe itself. During a collaboration with The Alchemist, a two-star Michelin restaurant in Denmark, Jahn was informed of a certain ant yogurt served at the restaurant. When she mentioned this to a colleague, he introduced her to one of his PhD students, who happened to be from a Bulgarian village that practiced ant yogurt fermentation.

These interactions naturally led to a field trip to the Bulgarian village, where the researchers learned about the recipe from the villagers themselves. The local community helped identify the right ant species, Formica rufa, or red wood ants common to the region.

Back in Denmark, the team added four live ants to a jar of warm, raw milk, placing a cheesecloth on top. Then the jar was planted into an ant mound for fermentation. The next day, the milk began to sour, starting its transition to a yogurt state.

After confirming the recipe, the researchers set out to concoct a scientific explanation for their culinary project. First, they ran a detailed analysis of the bacterial microbiomes that emerged from the yogurt-ification process. Surprisingly, they found that the ants held a number of compounds conducive to yogurt production.

For instance, formic acid, which the insects carry for self-defense, “can aid yogurt coagulation and shapes the conditions in the milk,” Jahn explained. Not only that, the ants' lactic and acetic acids transferred over to the yogurt base to accelerate fermentation, whereas their natural microbiome included molecules for texturizing the milk proteins.

Basically, the ant anatomy was an all-natural, yogurt-making machine—but only when they're alive, according to the researchers. When they tried the same recipe with live, frozen, or dehydrated ants, they found that the latter two weren't able to ferment the yogurt in the right way.

Later, they brought their results to The Alchemist, who helped create three different ant recipes: an ice cream ant-wich, goat milk mascarpone with ant additives, and a milk wash cocktail curdled with ants. Interestingly, with the exception of the ant-wich, the chefs reported that dehydrated ants were the best fit for their recipes.

That said, the researchers advise against trying this at home “unless users are cultural practitioners or skilled food microbiologists,” the paper noted. For one, ants are generally not authorized for sale as a food product in Europe, where the study was conducted. But picking off a random ant to put in raw milk is typically unsafe, since the insects could be carrying parasites.

Still, the new study is an illuminating account of the impressive science behind ancient traditions and “how we humans depend on so many other creatures for our living—cows, the plants feeding the cow, ants, and microbes,” Jahn said. This “yogurt and food in general represent a way to engage with all this life around us, to sense it through taste and texture, and might help us to appreciate it more.”

What if Disney villains were the inspiration for a bunch of dark academia anime characters? You can find out this month with the arrival of a new anime.

Disney has released a new trailer for Twisted Wonderland, based on the Japanese mobile game of the same name by Aniplex. Capturing a cult following around the world for character design from Black Butler creator Yana Taboso that mashes together Disney aesthetics with dark fantasy before funneling them through the vessels of waifish anime boys, the game and series follow a magical school where said anime boys are taught the tenets of sorcery inspired by immortalized abstracts of seven classic Disney villains: the Queen of Hearts, Scar, Ursula, Jafar, the Evil Queen, Hades, and Maleficent.

The anime will follow Yuken Enma, a high school student from Tokyo who finds himself magically and mysteriously whisked away to Night Raven College, forced to navigate the strange customs of life at a magical academy while trying to find his way back home to reality. Think isekai trope meets fun inversion of Alice falling into Wonderland, where villains are beloved rather than defeated antagonists, inspirational heads of academic houses that lead to some truly bonkers-looking uniforms—on display in the trailer below as we and Yuken are introduced to the Rose-Red Tyrant Riddle Roseheart, dorm leader for house Heartslabyul, who's giving major Queen-of-Hearts-meets-Regina-George energy.

It's no surprise that Disney is leaning all the way in on Twisted Wonderland. People have loved the studio's classic villains for years and years and have had that fandom satiated with reams of merchandise and spinoffs like the Descendants movies (or even their starring turns as antagonists in things like Kingdom Hearts). There's even a villains land on the way at Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World!

Thankfully fans won't have to wait too long to get this particular slice of villain fandom served up: Twisted Wonderland will begin streaming on Disney+ from October 29

Who's really causing the delays?

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and several administration officials have been frustrated by delays to the AI chip company's multi-billion-dollar deal with the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The deal was first announced during President Donald Trump's visit to the country, where the U.A.E. promised to invest up to a billion dollars in the U.S. in exchange for approval to purchase a billion dollars' worth of Nvidia chips. However, the Wall Street Journal reports that the Middle Eastern nation is yet to finalize its investments — a crucial requirement for U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick before he approves Nvidia's export licenses to the country.

UAE has been fast in jumping on the AI bandwagon, with G42, a UAE-based AI datacenter keen on getting its hands on Nvidia's latest chips. It's also the first to partner with OpenAI with the launch of Stargate UAE under its OpenAI for Countries global initiative.

However, it seems that the UAE's plans are being derailed as it faces some headwinds in its talks with Washington. The reason for the delay is unclear, but there are reportedly some private complaints that Sec. Lutnick was causing the slowdown. On the other hand, there are also conflicting reports that deny this, with an Nvidia executive reportedly saying that it has no concerns about how the deal is going down.

“Sacks and Secretary Lutnick are integral to the President's AI agenda and are working diligently to get deals done on behalf of the American people,” said White House spokesperson Kush Desai. David Sacks is the White House Special Advisor for Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, dubbed the White House AI Czar. Under his purview, the White House removed several regulations that were “burdensome” to AI development and focused on supporting the rapid innovation of American AI.

There are reports that the delays are caused by the Emiratis' slow commitment to their investments. It has already been months since the deal was first announced, but it seems that there hasn't been any progress with the talks. Aside from this, there were also some national security concerns because of the UAE's ties with China.

Despite all this, industry executives and administration officials see the UAE as crucial to maintaining the U.S.' global lead in AI. With the country willing to invest billions of dollars in infrastructure, it would allow American AI hardware to scale outside of the U.S. and its western allies. Aside from that, it's also seen as a key partner in expanding the United States' influence in artificial intelligence and advanced tech in the region.

AI chip design startup, Tenstorrent, has announced it's working with a range of companies to build out its next-generation AI chips. These include TSMC, Samsung, and Japanese firm Rapidus, all of which will provide their latest 2nm process nodes to develop future AI hardware. CEO and AMD and Apple Veteran, Jim Keller, has also said he'd consider working with Intel, but that it "still [has] a lot of work to do," according to Nikkei Asia.

Tenstorrent was founded in 2016, with Jim Keller coming on as CTO in 2020 and then CEO in 2023. It's targeting a different approach to giants like Nvidia in its chip production, focusing more on cutting costs and maximizing efficiency. Its current chips, like the Blackhole AI accelerator, are built on TSMC's 6nm node, while an upcoming Quasar chip design uses Samsung's 4nm process. Beyond that, it wants 2nm for whatever comes next.

It's rare for companies to work with such a range of manufacturers for cutting-edge chips, but Tenstorrent claims it can do it because it uses chiplets for its designs. That lets it have different fabricators build different chips for it, and then it can package them altogether on a single die.

Alongside TSMC and Samsung, it is also working with Japanese firm Rapidus, a startup set up in just 2022 and supported by a range of Japanese businesses. Its sole model is to produce cutting-edge 2nm hardware by 2027. This is partly to reinvigorate Japan's semiconductor industry, but also to create localized and national capacity for advanced semiconductor production, as many countries are looking to do following the AI boom.

Tenstorrent has also worked with GlobalFoundries in the past, and has said it won't rule out using Intel's process technology in the future. Keller just seemingly wants to see where that technology goes, especially following recent investments from Nvidia and the US government.

Speaking on Intel with Nikkei Asia, Jelly said that "they still have a lot of work to do ... to deliver a really solid technology roadmap."

More immediately, Keller is looking to undercut the competition and target smaller companies that want to still leverage the capabilities of locally run AI, not just those building out giant multi-billion-dollar data centers.

"Everybody says Nvidia, OpenAI, Google ... Well, the long tail of small applications is very large, too," Keller said. "We have developers who buy a $10,000 workstation and they're really happy. ... There's a lot of them, and that will lead to bigger business."

Microsoft announced huge price increases just this week

Just days after Microsoft announced a series of sweeping changes to its Game Pass subscription tiers, stalwart brick-and-morter vendor GameStop has announced it will continue to offer the service at its original price of $19.99, defying the company and its 50% price hike for Game Pass Ultimate.

In a now viral post on X, the company announced it would continue to sell Game Pass Ultimate for less than 20 bucks both in-store and online. That means you can swipe a one-month sub for considerably less than Microsoft is now asking, or grab a three-month membership for $59.99.

Following a price hike at Microsoft, you'll struggle to find a better deal on Game Pass than the $19.99 offering at GameStop. Get 400 titles, Xbox Cloud Streaming, and day-one access to titles like Call of Duty.

Microsoft's planned price increases have generally been met with fury by gamers. While the company raised prices last year simply to reflect challenging economic headwinds, this year's increases do at least herald material changes to the platform, whether that will be enough to convince gamers to keep paying for the service is another matter.

Microsoft's Game Pass tiers are now Essential, Premium, and Ultimate. The latter now comes with 400 games across PC, console, and cloud, and over 75 launch day titles annually, notably including Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, High on Life 2, Keeper, Ninja Gaiden 4, and The Outer Worlds 2. Ultimate now also includes Ubisoft+ Classics, with titles that include Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Breakpoint, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, and others.

The Premium tier remains $14.99, but only has some 200 titles, and also doesn't include the same launch day commitment.

U.S. customers can also grab 1-month Game Pass Ultimate codes for $19.99 from Amazon. While GameStop has made a big deal out of keeping prices fixed despite the increase, whether this is sustainable or not remains to be seen. The company is making enough noise to suggest it may be willing to eat the increase put on the service by Microsoft, or will simply keep selling Game Pass until it runs out of codes.

Rhea with advanced security and cryptography and without HBM2E.

SiPearl, a CPU developer funded by the EU, this week introduced its Ahena1, Europe's first high-performance processor with up to 80 cores designed for both civilian and military use. The CPU relies on the Rhea design but will be packed with sophisticated encryption and security capabilities when it becomes commercially available in the second half of 2027. Speaking of Rhea, the chip was taped out this summer and will sample in early 2026, marking another half-year delay.

SiPearl's Athena derives from the company's Rhea processor, but is enhanced with security and data integrity features that are demanded by government, aerospace, and defense applications. Specifically, the CPU is said to enable workloads like encrypted communications, intelligence analysis, cryptographic operations, and on-vehicle processing in defense and aerospace environments.

Athena1 is based on Arm's Neoverse V1 architecture and will be available in five configurations, offering 16, 32, 48, 64, or 80 Neoverse V1 cores, a range that enables adaptation to diverse performance and thermal profiles across a variety of applications from high-end workstations or servers to military vehicles.

From a silicon point of view, SiPearl's Athena1 indeed seems to be Rhea — or Rhea1, as the company calls it — as it features up to 80 Neoverse V1 cores with dual 256-bit Scalable Vector Extension units, consists of 61 billion transistors, and will be made by TSMC. However, the image demonstrated by SiPearl depicts a CPU without four HBM modules that are featured in Rhea — which are no longer needed for a CPU that is not designed for AI or HPC applications — and we can only wonder whether the processor retains a 256-bit DDR5 memory interface to provide enough memory bandwidth and capacity, as well as 104 PCIe 5.0 lanes.

SiPearl has contracted TSMC to produce and package both Rhea and Athena CPUs. Interestingly, while the initial packaging of Athena (which will not use any advanced packaging because it does not use HBM2E) will occur in Taiwan, SiPearl plans to shift this stage to Europe over time to reduce reliance on foreign ecosystems. The manufacturer expects Athena to be available in the second half of 2027, slightly later than Rhea, which is in the bring-up process and set to sample in 2026.

A big question is whether CPUs based on Neoverse V1 cores (unveiled in 2020) made on TSMC's N6 process technology (which belongs to TSMC's 7nm-class generation introduced in 2019) will offer competitive performance and efficiency in 2027, considering there will be CPUs featuring Neoverse V3 or even V4 on the market. SiPearl argues that the key advantage of its processor is its sovereign nature, but it remains to be seen whether this will convince businesses.

"In an era of geopolitical uncertainty, with cybersecurity issues and armed conflicts on the rise, Europe's technological sovereignty is more and more inseparable from sovereign hardware, whether for civil applications or, more importantly, defence," said Philippe Notton, CEO and founder of SiPearl. "It was therefore natural for SiPearl to capitalise on the expertise developed by its R&D teams in HPC to develop a new version of our first processor that perfectly meets the needs of dual-use purposes. As part of the roadmap entrusted to us by Europe to foster the return of high-performance processor technologies to the continent, Athena1 is the perfect complement to Rhea1 in helping to assert Europe's strategic independence."

A new national study reveals that hospitals providing surgical care have closed at a significantly higher rate than new ones have opened, with closures disproportionately concentrated in communities with high levels of poverty and social vulnerability. The study highlights a growing disparity in access to surgical care. 

The research will be presented at the American College of Surgeons (ACS) Clinical Congress 2025 in Chicago, October 4-7. 

Researchers used American Hospital Association data to track hospitals performing at least 100 operations per year in 2010 and 2020. Between hospital openings and closures, they found a net decrease of 298 surgical hospitals nationwide. The study authors then used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) to compare the socioeconomic characteristics of areas with hospital closures versus those with stable or new hospitals. 

We were surprised by just how big of a number it was. It is pretty startling to see such a drastic drop without adequate replacement volume, and it's concerning for patient access to care." 

Jesse E. Passman, MD, MPH, MSHP, lead author, general surgery resident at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

Net loss of access: The number of geographic areas within a 15-minute drive of a surgical hospital decreased by 6.2%, and the areas within a 30-minute drive decreased by 3.7%. 

Targeted closures: Newly closed hospitals were disproportionately located in census tracts with lower median incomes and higher social vulnerability scores than areas with hospitals that opened or remained active. These areas were more than twice as likely to be highly socially vulnerable. 

Systemic strain: Study authors warn that closures create a "huge influx of patients to surrounding hospitals, straining the emergency departments and surgical departments." 

"One of the hidden things that gets lost in the shuffle is patient records," said senior author Heather Wachtel, MD, MTR, FACS, an associate professor of surgery at the University of Pennsylvania. "When a hospital closes, patients who had their care there may lose access to their health care records. Having that information is essential to their ongoing health care." 

The reasons for closure, while not directly studied, are likely economic, related to challenges in sustaining smaller hospitals and safety-net institutions that serve a high proportion of patients on government insurance, authors note. 

The study underscores several critical consequences of hospital closures: 

Loss of medical history: Patients can permanently lose access to their medical records, leading to costly and dangerous duplicative testing, re-establishment of medical history, and a lack of crucial health information for new providers. 

Strain on surrounding systems: Remaining hospitals must absorb a sudden influx of new patients without established histories, stretching resources thin. 

Patients may forgo care: The increased burden of travel and finding new providers can cause some patients to delay or completely avoid seeking necessary medical or surgical care, allowing conditions to worsen. 

"For each one of these patients that actually shows up to our hospitals, I'm sure that there's a number of patients that don't," Dr. Passman said. "These conditions that could be handled and potentially cured surgically are now festering and becoming chronic problems."

The first successful human transplant of a kidney converted from blood type A to universal type O used special enzymes developed at the University of British Columbia to help prevent a mismatch and rejection of the organ.

Published today in Nature Biomedical Engineering, the achievement marks a major step toward helping thousands of patients get kidney transplants sooner.

In a first-in-human experiment, the enzyme-converted kidney was transplanted into a brain-dead recipient with consent from the family, allowing researchers to observe the immune response without risking a life.

For two days, the kidney functioned without signs of hyperacute rejection, the rapid immune reaction that can destroy an incompatible organ within minutes. By the third day, some blood-type markers reappeared, triggering a mild reaction, but the damage was far less severe than in a typical mismatch, and researchers saw signs that the body was beginning to tolerate the organ.

"This is the first time we've seen this play out in a human model," said Dr. Stephen Withers, UBC professor emeritus of chemistry who co-led the enzyme development. "It gives us invaluable insight into how to improve long-term outcomes."

The breakthrough is the result of more than a decade of work. In the early 2010s, Dr. Withers and colleague Dr. Jayachandran Kizhakkedathu, a UBC professor in the department of pathology and laboratory medicine and the Centre for Blood Research, were focused on making universal donor blood by stripping away the sugars that define blood types.

Those same sugars, or antigens, coat organ blood vessels. If a recipient's immune system detects the wrong antigen, it attacks. Type-O patients-more than half of kidney waitlists-can only receive type-O organs, yet type-O kidneys are often given to others because they're universally compatible. As a result, type-O patients typically wait two to four years longer, and many die waiting.

Traditional methods for overcoming blood-type incompatibility in transplants require days of intensive treatment to strip antibodies and suppress a recipient's immune system-and require organs from living donors. This new approach changes the organ rather than the patient, meaning transplants could be performed faster, with fewer complications, and for the first time could unlock the use of blood-type mismatched organs from deceased donors-when every hour can determine whether a patient lives or dies.

The key to this approach is the 2019 discovery by the UBC team of two highly efficient enzymes that remove the sugar that defines type-A blood, effectively converting it to type O.

"These enzymes are highly active, highly selective, and work at very low concentrations," said Dr. Kizhakkedathu. "That made the whole concept feasible."

The next challenge was applying this to whole organs, achieved in 2022 when a Toronto team showed lungs could be converted. After successful tests on blood, then lungs and kidneys (with the University of Cambridge) outside the body, the question remained: Could an enzyme-converted organ survive inside a human immune system?

The answer came in late 2023 on an overseas trip for Dr. Kizhakkedathu. "Our collaborators showed me their data where, using our enzymes, they had converted a human kidney and transplanted it into a brain-dead recipient. It was working beautifully." He stayed up late to call Dr. Withers first thing in the B.C. morning. "I was so thrilled. It was a dream moment."

Blood-type antigens act like nametags on cells, and the UBC enzymes act as molecular scissors, snipping off the 'nametag' that marks type A and revealing type O beneath.

It's like removing the red paint from a car and uncovering the neutral primer. Once that's done, the immune system no longer sees the organ as foreign."

Dr. Stephen Withers, UBC professor emeritus of chemistry

Regulatory approval for clinical trials is the next hurdle, and the partner UBC spin-off company Avivo Biomedical will lead development of these enzymes for transplant application and to enable the creation of universal donor blood on demand for transfusion medicine.

The potential is enormous. "This is what it looks like when years of basic science finally connect to patient care," said Dr. Withers. "Seeing our discoveries edge closer to real-world impact is what keeps us pushing forward."

Researchers at McMaster University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have made two scientific breakthroughs at once: they not only discovered a brand-new antibiotic that targets inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), but also successfully used a new type of AI to predict exactly how the drug works. To their knowledge, this a global first for the AI.

Detailed on October 3, 2025 in the journal Nature Microbiology, the discovery unveils a promising new treatment option for millions of people affected by Crohn's disease and other related conditions, while also showcasing important new applications for AI in drug discovery research.

"This work shows that we're still just scratching the surface as far as AI-guided drug discovery goes," says Jon Stokes, an assistant professor in McMaster's Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences and principal investigator on the new study.

The development of our new drug, which is designed to target IBD, has been fast-tracked thanks to the collaboration between humans and generative AI."

Jon Stokes, Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, McMaster University

Most antibiotics used in clinics today are "broad-spectrum" drugs, meaning they wipe out good bacteria in addition to those that cause disease - "they're nukes," Stokes explains.

This can create opportunities for invasive and drug-resistant species of bacteria, like E. coli, to move in and colonize the intestines, which can exacerbate conditions like Crohn's.

But enterololin, the new antibiotic discovered at McMaster, is a "narrow-spectrum" drug, meaning it spares the microbiome and attacks only a specific group of disease-causing bugs - in this case, a family of bacteria called Enterobacteriaceae, which happens to include E. coli.

This means it not only kills E. coli, but also reduces the opportunity for drug-resistant strains to colonize the gut in the first place.

"This new drug is a really promising treatment candidate for the millions of patients living with IBD," Stokes says. "We currently have no cure for these conditions, so developing something that might meaningfully alleviate symptoms could help people experience a much higher quality of life."

To date, AI has been leveraged as a tool for predicting which molecules might have therapeutic potential, but this study used it to describe what researchers call "mechanism of action" (MOA) - or how drugs attack disease.

"AI has expedited the rate at which we can explore chemical space for new drug candidates, but, until now, it has done little to alleviate a major bottleneck in drug development, which is understanding what these new drug candidates actually do," explains Stokes.

MOA studies, he says, are essential for drug development. They help scientists confirm safety, optimize dosage, make modifications to improve efficacy, and sometimes even uncover entirely new drug targets. They also help regulators determine whether or not a given drug candidate is suitable for use in humans.

But they're also notoriously expensive - and slow.

Stokes says a thorough MOA study can take up to two years and cost around $2 million; however, using AI, his group did enterololin's in just six months and for just $60,000.

Indeed, after his lab's discovery of the new antibiotic, Stokes connected with colleagues at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL) to see if any of their emerging machine learning platforms could help fast-track his upcoming MOA studies.

In just 100 seconds, he was given a prediction: his new drug attacked a microscopic protein complex called LolCDE, which is essential to the survival of certain bacteria.

"A lot of AI use in drug discovery has been about searching chemical space, identifying new molecules that might be active," says Regina Barzilay, a professor in MIT's School of Engineering and the developer of DiffDock, the AI model that made the prediction. "What we're showing here is that AI can also provide mechanistic explanations, which are critical for moving a molecule through the development pipeline."

Barzilay was recently listed among Time Magazine's most influential people in AI.

Stokes stresses that while the prediction was intriguing, it was just that - a prediction. He would still have to conduct traditional MOA studies in the lab.

"Currently, we can't just assume that these AI models are totally right, but the notion that it could be right took the guesswork out of our next steps," explains Stokes, a member of the Michael G. DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research at McMaster.

And so his team, led in large part by McMaster graduate student Denise Catacutan, began investigating enterololin's MOA, using MIT's prediction as a starting point.

Within just a few months, it became clear that the AI was in fact right.

"We did all of our standard MOA workup to validate the prediction - to see if the experiments would back-up the AI, and they did," says Catacutan, a PhD candidate in the Stokes Lab. "Doing it this way shaved a year-and-a-half off of our normal timeline."

With this, Stokes has now successfully used AI to discover viable drug candidates, to fast-track global drug discovery efforts, and to determine how new drugs work. But, ask him, and he'll tell you that - beneficial as it is - AI is merely a means to an end.

"Drug resistance and our lack of new drugs is a leaky faucet," he says. "You can leave it be for a while, but you're eventually going to have a big problem. AI is my wrench - it's a tool for fixing the leak before it becomes a flood, and that's really it. My sole focus is on getting new drugs to the patients who need them, and as long as AI can help me do that, then I'll continue to find new ways to use it."

The pathway to patients Stokes' spin-out company, Stoked Bio, has already licensed enterololin from McMaster and is currently optimizing it for human use.

The company is also testing modified versions of the new antibiotic against other drug-resistant bacteria, like Klebsiella, and early results are promising.

"The identification of enterololin underscores the remarkable science emerging at McMaster," says Jeff Skinner, CEO at Stoked Bio. "We are proud to partner with the university on translating this breakthrough into real therapies for patients."

If all goes well, Stokes says that the new drug will be ready for human trials within three years - a timeline his research team is eager to meet.

"Working on something translational like this is surreal," says Catacutan. "The fact that something we discovered in the lab may someday help patients is truly amazing, and really reinforces the significance of our work."

Obesity has long been acknowledged as a risk factor for a wide range of diseases, but a more precise link between obesity and Alzheimer's disease has remained a mystery – until now.

A first-of-its-kind study from Houston Methodist found that adipose-derived extracellular vesicles, tiny cell-to-cell messengers in the body, can signal the buildup of amyloid-β plaque in obese individuals. These plaques are a key feature of Alzheimer's disease.

The study, "Decoding Adipose–Brain Crosstalk: Distinct Lipid Cargo in Human Adipose-Derived Extracellular Vesicles Modulates Amyloid Aggregation in Alzheimer's Disease," published today in Alzheimer's & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association. It explores the link between obesity, which affects about 40% of the U.S population, and the dreaded neurodegenerative disease affecting more than 7 million people in the U.S.

The research was led by Stephen Wong, Ph.D., the John S. Dunn Presidential Distinguished Chair in Biomedical Engineering . Alongside Wong, Li Yang, Ph.D., a research associate at Houston Methodist, and Jianting Sheng, Ph.D., an assistant research professor of computational biology and mathematics in radiology at the Houston Methodist Academic Institute, provided leadership in experimental design and cross-institution coordination.

As recent studies have underscored, obesity is now recognized as the top modifiable risk factor for dementia in the United States."

The researchers found that the lipid cargo of these cell messengers differs between people with obesity and lean individuals, and that the presence and levels of specific lipids that differed between the groups changed how quickly amyloid-β clumped together in laboratory models. Using mouse models and patient body fat samples, the researchers examined the vesicles, which are tiny, membrane-bound particles that travel throughout the body and act as messengers involved in cell-to-cell communication. These minuscule communicators are also capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier.

Targeting these tiny cell messengers and disrupting their communication, which leads to plaque formation, may help reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease in people with obesity. The researchers said future work should focus on how drug therapy could stop or slow the build-up of Alzheimer's-related toxic proteins (such as amyloid-β) in at-risk individuals.

 October 03, 2025  

The average wait time to see a healthcare provider (HCP) in a medical clinic is 38 days. In contrast, patients with strep throat, urinary tract infections, pink eye, or other minor illnesses and injuries can access care in clinics tucked into their favorite big box stores or retail pharmacies in less than 20 minutes.

There are an estimated 1800 retail health clinics in 44 states that provide basic services on a walk-in or limited appointment basis. Data show that 25% of children and almost 30% of adults received care through outlets in stores like CVS, Walgreens, and Target where shorter wait times, convenient hours, and lower out-of-pocket costs are driving demand.

“Many of the patients we see at MinuteClinic either don't have a primary care provider or have not seen one in years,” said Angela Patterson, DNP, FNP-BC, NEA-BC, FAANP, enterprise chief nurse officer, vice president, and chief nurse practitioner (NP) officer, Retail Health for CVS Health. “We've been able to remove so many of the traditional barriers to care.”

Medscape continually surveys physicians and other medical professionals about key practice challenges and current issues, creating high-impact analyses. For example, the Medscape RN/LPN Job Market Report 2025 found that 

Offering convenient, more affordable access to care in underserved areas is among the reasons that visits to retail clinics increased 200% in a 5-year period, outpacing the use of urgent care clinics and emergency departments. Ateev Mehrotra MD, MPH, professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, attributes the spike to the “convenience revolution.”

“It reflects a change and shift in our society,” Mehrotra told Medscape Medical News. “Where you can get groceries 24/7 [and] banking 24/7…people are expecting the ability to get care at any time and outside an emergency department.”

NPs and physician assistants (PAs) are often the ones providing care in retail clinics. Their popularity is among the reasons that the American Association of Nurse Practitioners anticipates a 46% increase in job opportunities between 2023 and 2033.

“With physician shortages and provider burnout, NPs and PAs are playing a greater role in healthcare,” Patterson said.

Nationwide, NPs make up 20% of the primary care workforce and provide care that matches or exceeds their physician colleagues. Retail clinics have expanded the number of career opportunities for NPs and can have a positive impact in developing NP careers, according to the American Nurses Association.

Treating patients in retail clinics offers a predictable schedule free of overnight shifts, better work-life balance, and greater autonomy.

“Over the last 25-30 years, we've seen a slow but steady increase in the practice autonomy of nurse practitioners,” Mehrotra said. “In a primary care practice, the NP works under the physician…it could be a very hierarchical arrangement…so there's an autonomy component to [working in a retail clinic].”

While NPs might appreciate predictable schedules, working autonomously to treat minor illnesses and injuries, and providing care in a retail clinic, the model is not without its downsides.

Retail health clinics are struggling with staffing shortages, rising business costs, administrative burdens, and reimbursement challenges. In 2023, Walgreens closed 60 of its retail clinics and Walmart followed suit, closing all 51 Walmart Health centers across five states in 2024, leading to nurses' job losses. CVS Health also announced plans to lay off 2900 employees in 2024.

“There was a real crash in the field where the vast majority of retailers pulled out of the market,” Mehrotra said. “Now we're in this weird space where it's pretty much just one retailer…and almost all retail clinics are CVS MinuteClinic.”

MinuteClinic expanded its services to include a primary care model for adults in 12 states and the District of Columbia. Patterson says the model is seeing strong primary care patient enrollment as a result of same day access, extended evening and weekend hours, and virtual care options that are often absent from traditional primary care practices.

But there are concerns that using retail clinics as their main form of healthcare could result in a lack of proper preventive care; the absence of long-term patient-provider relationships could also impact outcomes. The American Medical Association expressed concerns that retail clinics resulted in lost opportunities for preventive care.

The same autonomy that attracts NPs to retail clinics can also be a drawback. There isn't another provider to consult, and seeing up to 30 patients per day could lead to burnout.

Patterson notes that MinuteClinic provides technology and resources, clinical decision-making tools, and mentorship to allow NPs to deliver evidence-based care. NPs also benefit from collaborating with care teams that include a population health coordinator who manages care between appointments and manages referrals and collaborating physicians who provide oversight of in-clinic teams, she added.

“Patients get both the intimacy of a one-on-one encounter and the safety net of a connected healthcare ecosystem,” Patterson explained.

Retail health clinics promised to provide convenient, more affordable options to treat minor illnesses and injuries, but the model has struggled to gain widespread traction. High cost and low insurance reimbursements are oft-cited reasons that Walmart Health and Walgreens have closed their retail health clinics.

Mehrotra believes that the explosion of telehealth options could also be to blame. One survey found that retail clinic utilization decreased 12% while telehealth visits increased 3% nationwide but more than three quarters of NPs still believe that retail health clinics are an important part of the health system. 

“We're in a situation where there's been a lot more competition for the retail clinics,” he said. “The question that comes up in that context is whether there's an even more convenient option for patients and whether retail clinics really have long-term legs.”

As part of this plan, Convatec will invest $600 m over the next ten years in R&D in the US, underlining the company's long-term commitment to its most significant market globally. The plans include a significant expansion of its world-class R&D facilities in Boston, United States, by end 2025 – increasing capacity by 50 % and further enhancing lab, testing and collaboration space.

In the United Kingdom, Convatec plans to invest £500 million (approximately $650 million), including a new state-of-the-art R&D hub in Manchester, set to open in 2027. The new facility will be one of the largest in Convatec's global network of Technology & Innovation Centres, with the potential to provide common or shared R&D capabilities and competences across all four of Convatec's categories: Advanced Wound Care, Ostomy Care, Continence Care, and Infusion Care. It will also house cutting-edge analytical R&D capabilities, regulatory functions, and digital health innovation, positioning Convatec at the forefront of medical technology development.

Convatec has a proud heritage of innovation that has transformed patient care and improved lives for millions of people worldwide. The company invests over $100 million annually in R&D —approximately 5 % of its revenue – which has delivered its strongest ever pipeline of new products designed to address unmet needs in chronic care. In addition to the major US and UK planned investments, Convatec will sustain investment in other key European locations, supporting its global network of Technology & Innovation Centres in Denmark and Slovakia and onsite R&D teams in Mexico and the Dominican Republic, as well as its global manufacturing network.

The plans to enhance Convatec's R&D footprint in the US and UK follows a comprehensive review of its global growth ambitions. Since 1996, Convatec's Deeside site has served as a major center for R&D alongside its manufacturing operations. The company has now identified Manchester as the ideal location for its new, enlarged UK facility, given its vibrant life sciences ecosystem, which includes leading universities, hospitals, and research institutions. In the US, the expansion of the Boston site will further strengthen Convatec's innovation leadership and support the company's largest market.

The new Manchester R&D hub will be home for around 200 highly skilled colleagues, largely transferring from Convatec's existing Deeside R&D site, with plans for further growth in the years ahead. Convatec's manufacturing site in Deeside, North Wales, will remain a cornerstone of its global operations and is unaffected by this change, with around 400 employees continuing to be based there after the move completes in 2027.

Today's announcement marks an exciting moment in Convatec's commitment to pioneering trusted medical solutions to improve the lives we touch. Our plans to invest more than $1 billion – anchored by major expansion plans in both the United States and the United Kingdom – demonstrates our unwavering commitment to advancing healthcare innovation for people living with chronic conditions around the world.”

Jonny Mason, Interim Chief Executive Officer, Convatec

Dr. Divakar Ramakrishnan, Chief Technology Officer and Head of Research & Development at Convatec, said: “The significant expansion of our R&D capabilities in Boston and plans to establish a new flagship center in Manchester are investments in the talent, technology, and infrastructure needed to accelerate innovation in pioneering trusted chronic care solutions. They reinforce our belief in the strength of the US and UK life sciences sectors and position Convatec at the forefront of medical technology innovation for years to come.”

The US expansion is expected to be completed by end 2025, and the new Manchester hub is expected to be operational by 2027, with a phased transition to ensure minimal disruption to ongoing projects and close collaboration with Convatec's wider global network of Technology & Innovation Centres. When fully operational, these flagship sites in Boston and Manchester will be at the heart of Convatec's global innovation network, which includes major sites in the UK, US, Denmark, and Slovakia. Both sites will play crucial roles in Convatec's R&D strategy along with other centers to drive innovation across Convatec's business worldwide.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 700 million people worldwide and is caused by genetic and environmental factors, as well as existing medical conditions. Known genetic risk factors for CKD include mutations in a gene called APOL1.

These are rare in most populations, but two risk variants are present in as much as 13 percent of people of West African origin, and another 38% possess one copy (carriers). The causes for APOL1-mediated kidney disease (AMKD) are currently not well understood, and treatments are lacking.

To gain a better understanding of AMKD, Siebe Spijker and his team from the University of Leiden, Netherlands, generated stem cells from skin biopsies of AMKD patients and turned them into microscopic structures known as kidney organoids, which can model aspects of human kidney function.

In some of these organoids, the APOL1 mutations were corrected by genetic engineering. The research was published today in Stem Cell Reports. Through a panel of lab-based tests, the researchers found that APOL1 mutations impair the proper function of mitochondria, which are required for respiration and energy production, in the kidney.

A cell type called the podocyte, which is essential for the kidney's filtering function, was particularly affected by APOL1 mutations since these podocytes are the cells that make the most APOL1 protein in the kidneys. These negative effects are mainly present when cells are stressed by inflammatory proteins. This finding could explain why inflammation in the body, e.g., from viral infections or autoimmune disease, often triggers the onset of AMKD in patients.

We anticipate that this human kidney organoid model will advance our understanding of AMKD and accelerate drug discovery, particularly given that APOL1 is not endogenously expressed in rodents."

Siebe Spijker, Clinical Nephrologist, University of Leiden

This research shows that mutant APOL1 affects mitochondrial function in podocytes and may open up avenues for designing targeted treatments for patients with AMKD.

Patients undergoing coronary angiography often experience anxiety both before and during the procedure, often treated by the administration of anti-anxiety medications. A new analysis being presented at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) Middle East 2025 Together with 16th Emirates Cardiac Society Conference found virtual reality (VR) effectively reduced anxiety during the procedure and had more stable vital signs than patients receiving standard care.

Virtual reality offers an innovative solution to manage and reduce the anxiety of patients undergoing an interventional cardiovascular procedure, like coronary angiography, that they are typically awake during."

Yousef Radwan Alnomani, Clinical Researcher, Benha University

Coronary angiography is part of a group of cardiac tests known as cardiac catheterization, which utilizes catheters to determine blockages and/or place stents in the vessels of the heart. Coronary angiography uses X-rays during the procedure to see if the blood vessel is narrowed or blocked during the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. In coronary angiography, the standard of care is to provide anti-anxiety medications to the patient before and during the procedure.

Virtual reality is a computer simulation that enables a person to interact with computer-generated 3-D visuals or other sensory environments.

Researchers analyzed data from five randomized controlled trials comprising 451 patients comparing VR to standard of care in patients undergoing coronary angiography. Some of the VR scenarios used included nature scenes like waterfalls, mountains and valleys, designed to induce a state of relaxation that may reduce anxiety and stabilize vital signs in these patients, Alnomani said. VR during coronary angiography was found to be superior to the standard of care in reducing anxiety and was associated with significantly lower changes in heart rate and blood pressure. While VR before coronary angiography did reduce anxiety, it did not show efficacy.

"Immersing patients in a 3D simulation offers better relaxation than just watching a similar video on a screen," Alnomani said.

Limitations of the study include its retrospective nature. Larger, randomized controlled trials are needed in the future to determine the broad use of VR in improving care of patients undergoing coronary angiography and other cardiovascular interventions.

When University of Texas at Arlington researcher Paul J. Fadel and his colleagues launched a study on vascular health in people with chronic kidney disease, they expected to better understand a long-standing belief. For years, scientists have pointed to a blood marker called ADMA-asymmetric dimethylarginine-as a warning sign for vascular problems.

But the team's findings, recently published in the American Journal of Physiology-Renal Physiology, told a different story.

Instead, another blood marker, SDMA-symmetric dimethylarginine-long considered mostly inactive, showed a stronger connection to vascular health than ADMA.

"The background premise of the study is that people with chronic kidney disease do not die from their kidney problems. They die from cardiovascular disease," said Dr. Fadel, who runs UT Arlington's Human Neural Cardiovascular Control Lab. "We wanted to better understand that connection by examining blood vessel function."

As is the case sometimes in research, the findings weren't entirely what the team expected. While confirming that SDMA is strongly related to kidney function, the study also revealed an unexpected twist-that it may flag early vascular problems more effectively than ADMA in people with chronic kidney disease.

Neither marker is a perfect predictor, Fadel said, but the discovery could help shape how doctors track and treat patients. Focusing on individuals with moderate kidney disease, the study found that higher SDMA levels-but not ADMA-correlated with weaker blood vessel function. In plain terms, SDMA may help identify at-risk patients earlier, potentially before dialysis becomes necessary.

We focused on patients with moderate chronic kidney disease, primarily stage 3, because intervention is still possible to offset the cardiovascular problems that arise with further disease progression and being put on dialysis."

Paul J. Fadel, University of Texas at Arlington

This research suggests that measuring SDMA levels may provide a better approach to monitoring vascular function in patients with kidney disease than relying on ADMA. However, the strength of associations was modest, potentially limiting the role of SDMA as a standalone predictor of vascular dysfunction. Fadel said more research is warranted.

Fadel served as a lead investigator on the project. Coauthors included UTA postdoctoral fellows and doctoral students, as well as physician collaborator Ponnaiah Mohan.

Early detection is key to breast cancer survival. But nearly half of all women in the U.S. have dense breast tissue, which can make detecting breast cancer difficult with a mammogram. Mayo Clinic researchers found that adding another test, called molecular breast imaging, or MBI, to a 3D mammogram improved the ability to find cancer in dense tissue by more than double.

"A mammogram is an important screening test that has been proven beneficial. But we've learned that in areas of dense breast tissue, breast cancers can hide from detection on a mammogram until they reach an advanced size. Our research focuses on detecting the most lethal cancers, which can include invasive tumors that grow quickly. If these are detected earlier, we likely can save more lives," says Carrie Hruska, Ph.D., a professor of medical physics and the lead author of a study published in Radiology. 

She and her research team studied 2,978 women with dense breasts between 40-75 years old at five separate centers. The study participants received two annual breast cancer screenings that included the combination of a supplemental MBI test and a 3D mammogram, also called digital breast tomosynthesis. 

Breast radiologists detected more cancerous tissue from the combined MBI and mammography screenings compared to either technique alone.

MBI is a fairly simple, low cost and safe option for women who have dense breasts and are seeking a supplemental screening test."

Carrie Hruska, Ph.D., Professor, Medical Physics, Mayo Clinic
 

MBI combined with a mammogram is available at about 30 sites in the U.S., including Mayo Clinic Health System in La Crosse, Wisconsin; Mayo Clinic Health System in Eau Claire, Wisconsin; and Mayo Clinic campuses in Rochester, Phoenix, and Jacksonville, Florida.

With more screening, there is a risk of being called back for additional testing to evaluate the findings. The researchers were pleased to find that although the addition of MBI to mammography led to 279 more women being called back in the first year of screening, this rate of callbacks decreased by half in the second round of screening.

Dr. Hruska's team is working on developing an algorithm that would cut the time it takes from 40 minutes to about 20 minutes or less to capture an image using this technique. This would make it more comfortable for women and enable more women to schedule this screening.

Review the study for a complete list of authors, disclosures and funding.

In a preclinical study, UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center scientists developed a highly targeted gene therapy that could revolutionize treatment for cancers linked to a common herpesvirus, with minimal side effects.

The novel approach treats Kaposi's sarcoma and related diseases caused by the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). The cancer-causing virus remains a major health issue, especially for people living with HIV/AIDS in parts of the world such as sub-Saharan Africa.

Findings from the research are now published and will appear in the December issue of Molecular Therapy Oncology.

The study's lead author is Yoshihiro Izumiya, a professor in the UC Davis Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine and the Department of Dermatology.

The new strategy uses a specialized gene therapy technique to selectively target and kill cancer cells infected with the virus - while leaving healthy cells unharmed."

Izumiya and members of his lab at UC Davis performed their research using mouse models.

"The treatment significantly reduced tumor growth with no detectable side effects," Izumiya said.

The therapy harnesses a harmless virus called adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver a genetic "Trojan horse" into infected cells. It does so by using the virus' own protein to drive the therapeutic agents into the cancer cells to kill the cells.

This gene therapy is designed to become active only in cells harboring KSHV, thanks to a viral marker protein known as LANA, which is only found in KSHV-infected cancer cells.

Once inside the KSHV-infected cell, the therapy delivers a gene for a modified thymidine kinase enzyme that converts a common anti-herpesvirus drug - ganciclovir - into a cancer-killing agent. When the drug is added, only the infected cells are affected, triggering their death while sparing healthy tissue.

"This is a precision-guided approach that uses the virus's own tricks against it," said Izumiya. "It's like delivering a self-destruct signal directly into the cancer cells."

In tests with lab-grown human cells, the therapy successfully eliminated KSHV-infected cells while leaving uninfected ones unharmed. When tested in mice with KSHV-related tumors, the therapy - combined with ganciclovir - effectively halted tumor growth.

Importantly, the treatment caused no observable side effects in mice, suggesting a high level of safety.

Researchers also discovered that anti-cancer drugs known to reactivate KSHV made the therapy even more effective, boosting its impact by enhancing the delivery system's activation.

KSHV is responsible for several aggressive cancers, including Kaposi's sarcoma and two rare lymphomas. While current treatments exist, they often come with significant side effects and are not always effective, especially in immunocompromised patients.

This new gene therapy could offer a safer, more targeted option. By focusing only on virus-infected cells, the treatment minimizes the risk to healthy tissues - a major hurdle in conventional cancer therapy.

This research is still in its early stages and will require further testing before it can move to human trials. But the results offer hope for a more precise, less toxic way to treat KSHV-related cancers and possibly other cancers caused by viruses.

"Our goal is to turn the virus's own biology into its weakness," Izumiya said. "This is a step toward smarter, more personalized cancer treatments."

This research was funded by the National Cancer Institute (CA299587) and the American Cancer Society.

Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) are wearable technologies that track blood sugar in real time and help patients with type 2 diabetes improve blood sugar control. In 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved over-the-counter CGMs for individuals with and without diabetes, but there is limited understanding of how to interpret CGM metrics in individuals who do not have diabetes. Researchers from Mass General Brigham analyzed CGM data from people with diabetes, prediabetes, and normal glycemic control, finding that while CGM metrics in patients with diabetes correlated with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), the gold-standard assessment for average blood sugar control, this relationship weakened in those with prediabetes, and disappeared for those without diabetes. Findings are published in Diabetes Technology and Therapeutics.

Our study reaffirms that CGMs are great tools for people with diabetes, but their numbers don't reflect the standard HbA1c test for people with prediabetes or normal blood sugar. Especially for those without diabetes, CGM data is not a substitute for HbA1c, which assesses how well the body controls blood sugar over multiple months."

Jorge A. Rodriguez, MD, corresponding author of Mass General Brigham's Department of Medicine and the Division of General Internal Medicine and Primary Care at Brigham and Women's Hospital

The authors analyzed data from 972 adults aged 40 years and older with and without diabetes, who are participating in the federally funded Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Consortium to Advance Health Equity and Researcher Diversity (AIM-AHEAD) program. Starting in 2022, study participants were enrolled at the University of Alabama, University of California, San Diego, and University of Washington, and wore a Dexcom G6, a device that measured blood sugar every five minutes for up to 10 days.

Mass General Brigham researchers examined the relationship between HbA1c, which was measured at the start of the study, and eight different CGM metrics, such as average blood sugar, time spent in a healthy range, and measures of blood sugar variability. In those with type 2 diabetes, CGM metrics - especially average glucose - were closely aligned with the gold-standard HbA1c measurement. This correlation was weaker in those with prediabetes. In those with normal blood sugar, CGM metrics were largely unrelated to HbA1c. These patterns remained when the researchers accounted for factors such as body mass index.

The authors note that it makes sense that CGM metrics most reliably reflect long-term blood sugar control in people with diabetes, given that CGMs were originally designed for this population. In those without diabetes, short-term fluctuations in blood sugar, which happen naturally with meals and activity, are likely not sustained long enough to affect HbA1c, but can provide real-time information about how lifestyle and medications impact blood sugar variability.

The researchers highlight that people with prediabetes or normal blood sugar, as well as their clinicians, should be careful about drawing conclusions from CGM data. Long-term studies may uncover whether CGM data can help identify subpopulations of people with normal HbA1c who may be at greater risk of developing diabetes. The researchers also emphasize the importance of ongoing digital health equity work, to ensure that diabetes prevention innovation is accessible to those who need it most.

"As a physician, it is important to me to be able to advise all patients who may increasingly use these monitors," Rodriguez said. "In those without diabetes, CGMs may be useful as behavioral 'biofeedback' tools that can provide insight into how food and activity impact real-time blood sugar levels, but they do not directly reflect longer term blood sugar control."

Italy's Juventus Football Club banned three fans from rival club Parma on Friday for shouting racist comments at United States national team star Weston McKennie after a league match between the teams in August. McKennie, a Texas native who is Black, has played for Juventus in the Italian Serie A League since 2020 and has heard racist comments from fans several times during his professional career overseas.

Club officials said they used a “state-of-the-art surveillance system,” including multifocal cameras, to help law enforcement identify the three visiting supporters. Authorities say they heckled McKinnie as he cooled down after the match with his teammates.

The incident — and the technology used to catch the perpetrators — raises questions about how FIFA will combat racist language, gestures or chants during the 2026 World Cup in the U.S., Canada and Mexico next summer. 

After the first few opening matches of the Club World Cup, a lack of anti-racism and discrimination signage led to criticism from fans. FIFA responded by playing a message on video boards before subsequent games in which several players repeated the same mantra.  

“Rise up and play your part. It's time to make a stand. Make your voice heard for football without racism. Say no to racism,” the players said during the video.

Despite the campaign, the issue persists at soccer matches around the world. Soccer's world-wide governing body fined six nations on Sept. 3, including defending World Cup champion Argentina, for racist abuse by fans at World Cup qualifiers in June. The six countries officials said engaged in “discrimination and racist abuse” were Albania, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, according to the FIFA disciplinary committee. It did not provide details on the cases.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino urged politicians and law enforcement professionals around the world to join his organization in the fight against racism and discrimination. He delivered a pre-recorded video message to the Red Card to Racism in Football event in May, saying criminal penalties should be imposed on offenders.

“FIFA's Global Stand Against Racism called for the football world to take action,” Infantino said. “To educate, to raise awareness and when necessary to punish. Racism, discrimination — they are not just wrong, they are crimes.”

FIFA said it will use its “three-step anti-discrimination procedure” to tackle racism and discrimination if encountered at a match, whether in the stands or on the pitch.

That procedure involves players, staff and even fans using the “No Racism” gesture seen in the player's video to alert officials to a violation. The next step would be a formal disciplinary process for any team personnel or fans involved — for instance, banning them from future competitions. The third step is sharing evidence for national-level prosecutions if local statutes apply.  

Juventus referred to their own club code of conduct in deciding the punishment for the Parma fans. The club has previously dealt with similar incidents by visiting supporters following games in 2023 and 2024.

The response to racist abuse directed at Weston McKennie highlights ongoing challenges with racism in soccer and raises questions about how global football organizations and clubs address such incidents, particularly as the 2026 World Cup approaches.

Repeated racist abuse towards players demonstrates persistent discrimination in professional soccer, spurring calls for stronger action and penalties from clubs and governing bodies.

The use of advanced surveillance technology by clubs helps identify and ban perpetrators, representing evolving methods to combat discriminatory behavior at sporting events.

FIFA's anti-racism initiatives and punitive measures, such as the three-step procedure and fines, show how official policies are being evaluated and challenged in confronting global discrimination in the sport.

‘Seven or eight' players to miss Liverpool match

Manager dismisses discipline issue after red cards

Enzo Maresca believes Chelsea are paying the price for their Club World Cup exertions, with the manager without “seven or eight” players for Saturday's visit of Liverpool.

Cole Palmer is out with a recurring groin problem, joining the long-term absentees Wesley Fofana, Liam Delap, Levi Colwill, Andrey Santos and Tosin Adarabioyo on the sidelines, and Trevoh Chalobah is suspended after his sending-off in last weekend's home defeat by Brighton.

A report published by the global players' union Fifpro this week said Chelsea's players were given 20 days off after winning the Club World Cup in July, and that the beaten finalists, Paris Saint-Germain, rested players for 22 days, a high workload it linked to both clubs' injury problems.

Maresca said he agreed with the tenor of the Fifpro report before expressing faith in the young players he will call up to stand in, with the 19-year-old Josh Acheampong expected to replace Chalobah at centre-back for his fourth Premier League start.

“It's reality,” Maresca said. “If PSG and Chelsea have so many injuries, probably it's some consequences from the Club World Cup. In this moment we have four or five defenders out, but we're going to try to adapt and find the right solution.

“It is difficult, but at the same time we trust the ones that are here.

For sure, when you can change one player after four or five games, it's better. The more you play together with teammates, the relationship becomes better. Sometimes you don't even need to speak to do something on the pitch – they understand immediately. When you continue to change it's more difficult.

“But I really trust the young players. Not just the young players that we buy but also the young players from the academy. We gave games last year to Josh so that shows that I trust young players.”

Maresca was on less sure ground when claiming to be unconcerned by Chelsea's disciplinary record, with João Pedro's sending-off in their Champions League win over Benfica this week their third red card in as many matches after Chalobah's dismissal and Robert Sánchez's in the defeat at Manchester United.

Since Maresca joined in June 2024, Chelsea's disciplinary record across all competitions is the worst of the Premier League clubs, with seven red cards in 73 games, one every 10.4 matches.

Chelsea also top the table for Premier League yellow cards under his reign, with 114, and the Italian has the second-highest card-per-game rate at one club in the Premier League at 2.7, a figure beaten by Mauricio Pochettino during his time at Stamford Bridge (2.9).

“I don't see any discipline problem,” Maresca said. “You have to analyse case by case. When it's a red card for bad intention or for bad discipline, it's different compared to the United red card or the Brighton red card. In that case, it's just a decision that you have to take in two seconds, three seconds. Do I do foul or not? It's difficult.”

Manchester United and Chelsea both continued their unbeaten starts to the Women's Super League season as a stunning Anna Sandberg strike earned the Red Devils a well-deserved 1-1 draw against the champions, who dropped points for the first time this season. Wieke Kaptein scored an early opener for the Blues and both sides could have gone on to clinch victory in an entertaining encounter between the two early pace-setters.

Man United came into the game having never beaten Chelsea in the WSL, but had the better of much of the first half as they showed just why they have begun the new season unbeaten. Marc Skinner's Red Devils could have gone to the summit of the table with victory, and played like a team with a point to prove.

United striker Elisabeth Terland forced the game's first save early on, before Ella Toone freed Jess Park on the break but she could only clip the ball over. The early signs of encouragement were there, though, until Chelsea took the lead against the run of play in the ninth minute. It was a moment of undoubted quality. Catarina Macario back-heeled the ball into the onrushing Kaptein, who calmly passed the ball beyond Phallon Tullis-Joyce and into the back of the net.

The home side would soon be level, though, and what a goal it was. Receiving a knock-down from Toone, left-back Sandberg hit the ball first time on the volley and saw her strike nestle perfectly into the corner of the net. It was a goal which even the champions could do nothing about.

United were the better side for much of the second period, Fridolina Rolfo seeing a deflected strike rebound off the top of the crossbar while Toone struck just over on a couple of occasions. If any side would win, it looked like the Red Devils - until a couple of nervy moments late on, where Keira Walsh forced a smart save while Dominique Jansen caused a nervy moment for her goalkeeper. One final cross by Blues substitute Alyssa Thompson sailed agonisingly out of play and the referee blew the final whistle after an enthralling encounter.

The Iranian delegation, sent to attend the December draw for the 2026 World Cup, has been denied entry into the United States of America.

Slated to take place in the USA, Mexico and Canada, the United States will be aiming to make a deep push in the World Cup being contested on their own turf, having appointed former Tottenham Hotspur, PSG and Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino in 2024.

Due to matters away from the pitch, however, the 2026 World Cup has been under a microscope for a number of reasons in the run-up to the competition. American president Donald Trump has also stated that any potential decision to ban Israel from the World Cup would be blocked by the country, which has further fueled discussions about the tournament.

The draw for the upcoming edition of football's most prestigious competition is slated to take place in the American capital of Washington D.C., on 5 December, where group stage fixtures will be determined.

As per Morocco World News, "the United States has denied the Iranian delegation's entry into the country to attend the draw" for the group stage, according to Amir-Mehdi Alawi, an Iranian Football Federation (FFI) spokesman, despite the Iranian national football team having qualified for the competition.

"The list includes federation president Mehdi Taj, national-team coach Amir Ghalenoei, and seven other officials, according to federation spokesman Amir-Mehdi Alavi."

Reportedly, The FFI plan to ask Gianni Infantino, president of FIFA, to "intervene and try to overturn the decision." Concerns over the relations between the two countries have been questioned throughout the year, following changes to American visa requirements for Iranians being imposed during Trump's presidency. This, in turn, fueled speculation that participation in the World Cup for Iran's national team "would be jeopardised."

Though Canada and Mexico will also host games throughout the tournament, the majority of matches in the tournament will be played in the United States, where 11 of the 16 host cities are based.

Iran were one of 12 countries that were revealed to be banned from entering America and the denial of entry to the FFI delegation suggests that the US are unmoved from their earlier stance. Whether a resolution for this situation is ultimately found before the draw takes place in December remains to be seen.

Manchester United are reportedly starting preparations to have backup plans in place in case they decide to sack Ruben Amorim before the end of the current season. According to reports, former United midfielder and current under-18 head coach Darren Fletcher has emerged as the favourite to take over the reins in an interim role if Amorim faces the axe.

FIFA vice president Victor Montagliani struck down U.S. President Donald Trump's recent threats to move certain host cities for the 2026 World Cup, asserting that only FIFA can “make those decisions.”

The 2026 World Cup is set to unfold across the United States, Canada and Mexico next summer, bringing soccer's biggest tournament to North America for the first time since 1994. Eleven cities in the U.S., including Seattle and San Francisco, will host matches, which were scrutinized by President Trump last week.

“It will be safe for the World Cup. If I think it isn't safe [for the World Cup], we'll move it to a different city. Absolutely… If I think it's not safe, we're going to move it out of that city,” the U.S. president said.

Now, Montagliani made his and FIFA's stance clear on the subject, going directly against the remarks of President Trump.

“It's FIFA's tournament, FIFA's jurisdiction, FIFA makes those decisions,” Montagliani, who is also president of Concacaf, said on Wednesday at a sports business conference in London.

“With all due respect to current world leaders, football is bigger than them and football will survive their regime and their government and their slogans.

“That's the beauty of our game, is that it is bigger than any individual and bigger than any country,” Montagliani finished. 

The 11 host cities in the U.S., along with the three in Mexico and two in Canada, are under contract with FIFA for the 2026 World Cup. Severe logistical, legal and financial issues could arise with the change of any host city with the tournament just nine months away.

FIFA president Gianni Infantino has not yet weighed in on the subject.

The U.S. men's national team kicks off their 2026 World Cup campaign in Los Angeles at SoFi Stadium before heading to Seattle to play their second group stage match at Lumen Field.

The stakes surrounding the match could be much bigger than just three points should President Trump ramp up his threat to remove Seattle as one of the host cities for the competition. The city has been one of several in the U.S. to push back against President Trump's immigration and crime policies.

It remains unclear how matches could, or potentially would, be moved to other cities. The World Cup draw is slated to take place on Dec. 5 at the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C.

For the second time this season, a legend of the game is getting her flowers.

First, it was Alex Morgan. Now, Christine Sinclair gets the royal treatment in Portland with a Thorns Hall of Fame induction and jersey retirement. From her time with the Canadian national team to the birth and rebirth of U.S. women's soccer leagues leading to the launch of the NWSL in 2013, Sinclair has seen it all.

As one of the OG NWSL players, who helped define what the league would look like, Sinclair crystalized her legacy over 12 seasons – all with Portland. In all competitions, she scored 79 goals and had 19 assists.

It's hard to pick from a monumental career like that, but in honor of the Sinc celebration this weekend, we're looking back at 12 of Portland's forever No. 12's best goals in the league.

Her stoppage time goal in the 2013 NWSL Championship not only secured Portland's first title, but it also marked the beginning of a new era of women's soccer. The Thorns became the very first NWSL Champions, something they'd repeat two more times – in 2017 and again in 2022 – before Sinclair retired.

But you always remember your first. With 90 minutes down, the Thorns led the Western New York Flash 1-0. Two minutes into stoppage time, Morgan teed up a pass through the Flash defense and Sinclair drove it home to the lower left corner.

After scoring two goals in the first half against the Boston Breakers on July 20, 2014, it was again Morgan who set Sinclair up to finish the job. The third goal of Sinclair's hat trick came just moments into the second half after Morgan danced around in front of Alyssa Naeher but couldn't get a shot off. Morgan passes to Sinclair, and with a single touch, she puts Portland up 4-3.

The best kind of chips are as follows: ice, potato, and Sinc. See proof of No. 3 – from 2015 – below.

After falling to the Flash 2-0 in October 2016, Sinclair took it upon herself to try and mount a comeback. Though the Thorns ultimately lost 4-3, she opened up scoring for Portland with a long, high ball. With a single touch she volleyed it home.

As much as Sinclair got by with help from her teammates, sometimes she got creative and assisted herself – like this 2017 game against the Spirit. She put pressure on the defender, and with her momentum, the ball popped up towards the goal. With a tap of her left foot, Sinclair gets the goal.

What a time to be alive, hearing the words Tobin Heath to Christine Sinclair is like music to the ears. This equalizing goal when Portland played Chicago in 2018 is simply electric.

Sinclair makes it look easy with another single touch goal against the Pride in 2019.

Always in the right place at the right time, this Fall Series goal against the Reign in 2020 rips off Sinclair's right foot and whizzes into the back of the net.

In the eighth minute of the 2021 Challenge Cup Final, Sinclair made herself known. With pressure on Gotham, she forced a turnover and took it home herself with a clean shot from just outside the box.

In a 2022 match against Angel City, the Thorns took an early 1-0 lead, but when Hina Sugita forced a turnover just minutes later, Sinclair didn't miss her chance to double the lead.

There is nothing like a rivalry, and there is nothing like the Cascadia Rivalry. As the minutes wound down in this June 2023 match, the Thorns were up 1-0, but in these intense games, you can't be too safe. Morgan Weaver took the ball down to the line and crossed it into Seattle's box, where Sinclair drove it home with a single touch.

In 2024, the Orlando Pride were cruising through the regular season on their way to the championship. The team was in the middle of a 24-match undefeated streak and seemed impenetrable.

Leave it to Sinclair to be part of history in what would be her second to last home game in Providence Park. Less than 10 minutes into the second half, Sinclair doubled Portland's lead with a shot from just outside the 18.

If the past is any indication, fans can expect the home crowd to be out in full force to celebrate No. 12. You can watch the Thorns host Bay FC on Saturday, October 4 at 10 p.m. ET on ION.

The U.S. State Department has reportedly declined visa requests for an official Iranian delegation to attend the draw for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which is scheduled to be held at the Kennedy Center in D.C. on Dec. 5. The Tehran Times, an English-language Iranian news outlet, reported Wednesday that the U.S. government has not issued visas for Iran Football Federation President Mehdi Taj, coach Amir Ghalenoei and seven other federation members seeking to attend the draw.

The report of a potential effort by the federal government to prevent the Iranian officials from attending the draw has naturally raised questions about whether the Iranian team, which has already qualified for the World Cup, will be able to participate in the competition itself next summer. President Trump issued an executive order earlier this year banning travel to the U.S. from 12 countries, including Iran, but included a carve-out for “major sporting events,” with specific references to the World Cup and Olympics. 

FIFA VP and Concacaf President Victor Montagliani said Wednesday at Leaders Week London that he was not concerned about the Iranian national team being able to play matches in the U.S. during next summer's World Cup despite the host country's restrictions on travel from Iran. He said that where Iran plays its matches will be determined by December's draw rather than any geopolitical considerations. “We already have assurances from all three governments [the U.S., Canada and Mexico] ... that teams that qualify will be allowed to come in and participate,” Montagliani said.

A State Dept. spokesperson declined comment to SBJ, citing visa record confidentiality.

The true consequences of Chelsea's gruelling 2025 are beginning to emerge, as it has revealed that multiple first-team stars are playing through pain after a physically challenging few months which included the Blues winning the Club World Cup in difficult weather conditions in the US. Enzo Maresca's side were barely given enough time for a pre-season as a result and several injury issues have followed. Further first-team stars have had to push through the pain and continue to play.

Italy are due to play Israel in a FIFA World Cup qualifier in Udine but there have been calls for a boycott.

Pro-Palestinian protesters approached the gates of the Italy football team's training centre on Friday to demand the cancellation of its upcoming World Cup qualifier against Israel due to the war on Gaza.

The protest was part of a national strike that was reacting to Israeli forces' interdiction of an aid flotilla.

Italy is scheduled to host Israel in Udine on October 14. But UEFA is considering suspending Israel over the war. The players were not at the Coverciano training centre in Florence, but the squad will convene there on Monday.

Protesters appeared to behave peacefully on the opposite side of the street from the football complex, holding aloft a banner that read in Italian, “Let's stop Zionism with the resistance.” A protest leader grabbed a microphone and shouted, “How can you still allow Israel, a Zionist and criminal state, to play football games?”

Dozens of protests have erupted across Italy since Wednesday night, after the Israeli navy intercepted the Global Sumud Flotilla, detaining its activists.

On Friday, workers and students took to the streets after the country's largest unions called for a one-day general strike in solidarity with the Palestinians and the flotilla. Hundreds of trains were cancelled or delayed, as were several domestic flights, and many private and public schools closed.

The Italian Football Coaches' Association (AIAC) pushed in August for Israel to be suspended from international competition for its war on Gaza.

Thomas Tuchel says it would be “better if we play later” as the England boss welcomed the idea of next summer's World Cup kick-off times being moved back to deal with the intense heat.

The back-to-back European Championship runners-up are among the favourites to win a tournament they could qualify for this month if they beat Latvia and other results in Group K go their way.

The United States, Canada and Mexico are co-hosting a tournament that will be played amid challenging conditions, which Tuchel witnessed firsthand during his time at the Club World Cup.

FIFA vice-president Victor Montagliani this week said the impact of kick-off times had been a major lesson for the organisers, meaning fixtures could be put back to combat the heat next year.

“I know the fans will not like it but for us it's better if we play later, of course,” England boss Tuchel said. “For everyone it's better to play later.”

Tuchel said “if you do a run at 2pm in Charlotte then you know” when asked why it would be better to move World Cup kick-off times.

The England boss says “we have put the players first” and “protect the game”, even if it means those back home face some late nights.

“Midnight here, I understand that it's bad for our fans,” Tuchel said. “I understand it, it's bad for the children, bad for the young people who go to school, very bad.

“There will be a lot of drop outs the next day at school, I guess!”

Asked if the timing of games could be the difference between winning and losing matches, he said: “Well, then straightaway everyone will make the point the others also play in the heat… it would be a disadvantage for us, for sure.

“Would we adapt to it, if we have to? Yes. Would we use it as an excuse? No.

“Would we still prefer to play in the evening, when shade is on the pitch? Yes, for sure.

“It's just proven, you see more intensive runs, you see more high-intensity runs, you see more recovery runs, you see a more intense game. (Earlier) it becomes slower, and less quality.”

The heat is an important consideration when it comes to the approach of teams that are already noticeably changing tack, certainly across the Premier League.

Tuchel last month said he was ready to mix it up at the World Cup, saying the “long throw-in is back” as he also spoke about the need to utilise long balls.

The weeks since England's last camp has underlined that change in tack, from Liverpool's set pieces struggles to Pep Guardiola getting Manchester City defending deep at Arsenal.

“The bus is back! The bus in front of the goal,” Tuchel said smiling.

“Well, statistics just show you, you increase the probability of goalscoring opportunity with a long throw-in. Long goal kicks are back, it's not only about playing short.

“I think it's just everyone tries to find the slightest advantage, and once you suffer against a team who's doing it, you go ‘why are we not doing this?'

“So, it slows a bit the game down, it interrupts the game, but this is how everyone plays, according to the rules. These things are back, and also we will try to find our advantages of course.”

World Cup

England head coach Thomas Tuchel has admitted that he would prefer later kick-off times at next summer's World Cup to “protect the game” even if it makes the matches harder to watch on television in Europe.

Talks are ongoing about the precise schedule for next summer's tournament, which will be held in the United States, Canada and Mexico, before the draw in Washington DC in December. Day-time kick-offs would be preferable for European TV viewers, but would have to be played at temperatures that would be difficult for players.

Tuchel spent much of the summer at the Club World Cup in the U.S., and came back knowing how hard it is to play football in those conditions. Speaking at his squad announcement press conference at Wembley on Friday, Tuchel said that he would rather not play in that heat and humidity in the middle of the day.

“I know the fans will not like it but for us it's better if we play later,” Tuchel said. “For everyone it's better to play later.”

At the Club World Cup there were many games kicking off at 12pm or 3pm Eastern Daylight Time (EDT). Those games were easy to follow on TV in Europe (EDT is five hours behind British Summer Time) but difficult for the players. Tuchel said that his experiences at the tournament meant he did not want his England team to go through that next year.

“If you do a run at 2pm in Charlotte then you know,” said Tuchel, when asked why exactly he wanted later kick-off times. “It's clear, for me, we have to put the players first. Because the players are the game, and we have to protect the game.”

Tuchel's clear preference is for evening kick-offs in north America, when the temperature is generally cooler. This would be better for the players but harder for those watching at home in Europe, with games being broadcast at midnight or 1am in the UK.

“I understand that it's bad for our fans,” Tuchel said, when asked about the possibility of midnight BST kick-offs next summer. “I understand it, it's bad for the children, bad for the young people who go to school, very bad. There will be a lot of drop-outs the next day at school, I guess!“

When asked whether he expected his own view on this to be listened to, Tuchel was not optimistic. “I'm not sure if the coaches have a big word on that,” he said. “I think everyone is very clear about it.”

World Cup

FIFA will charge both sellers and buyers a 15 per cent fee on its official 2026 World Cup ticket resale platform, which launched on Thursday and almost immediately had some tickets listed for tens of thousands of dollars. Many prices were several times, or even more than 10 times, higher than those paid on the primary market on Wednesday.

At past World Cups, FIFA capped resale prices at face value and took smaller fees — 10 per cent or less.

For the 2026 tournament, adapting to the relatively unregulated secondary market in the United States and Canada, FIFA chose not to cap resale prices — because, an official argued last month, if FIFA did cap prices, it could not stop sellers from going to third-party sites like StubHub to fetch more money. (In Mexico, where ticket resale laws are stricter and the government lobbied for a cap, FIFA agreed to limit prices to face value on a “ticket exchange” platform.)

What FIFA spokespeople wouldn't say at the time was what cut of all resales the global soccer governing body would take. On Thursday, one day after primary sales opened, fans found out that FIFA would take 15 per cent of a seller's income (a “Resale Fee”, per FIFA's terms) and also charge the buyer an extra 15 per cent of the list price (a “Purchase Fee”).

So, for example, if a ticket sold for $1,000, the seller would get $850 and FIFA would take $150. The buyer would pay $1,150 — including another $150 to FIFA, in addition to the other $150 to FIFA and $850 to the seller.

In other words, FIFA will bring in an extra $30 for every $100 in resales on its platform.

This is in addition to the billions of dollars that FIFA will make on the primary market. Its list prices, revealed to fans for the first time on Wednesday and compiled by The Athletic, are by far the highest in World Cup history — in some cases more than twice as expensive as equivalent prices at previous World Cups, even after adjusting for inflation.

Industry experts told The Athletic that the 15 per cent fees are similar to the ones charged by StubHub, SeatGeek and other U.S.-based resale companies.

“(They're) standard,” according to Pnina Feldman, a University of Virginia professor who has studied ticket resale markets. “And from my research, a good thing to do because it's a way to regulate the number of transactions on the secondary market.”

FIFA would also argue that, like with dynamic pricing, its resale platform strategy will funnel more money into soccer, rather than into the hands of individuals and for-profit American companies.

Critics, though, argue that FIFA is a non-profit whose mission, in part, is to make the sport more accessible. Some also argue that its decision not to cap resale prices has encouraged scalpers into the World Cup ticket ecosystem and among the 4.5 million fans who entered the “Visa presale” lottery.

Zohran Mamdani, the favorite in New York City's mayoral race and a soccer fan, launched a “Game Over Greed” campaign last month in which he called on FIFA to reinstate its resale cap. He said that the uncapped platform is “yet another method of gatekeeping the game”.

On the first day of official resales, a Category 3 group-stage ticket was listed by a holder for $15,000. Some listings offered standard tickets for more than the current prices for hospitality packages, which have been on sale for months.

A Category 4 ticket to the U.S. opener at SoFi Stadium in Southern California, which cost $560 on the primary market Wednesday, was listed for $2,950.

A Category 4 ticket to the final — in the way upper corner of MetLife Stadium in New Jersey — was listed at $25,000, having gone for $2,030 on the primary market one day earlier. (FIFA would take $7,500 in fees on this resold ticket if purchased.)

A Football Supporters' Association (FSA) spokesperson called the prices “astonishing” and “unacceptable”.

Thomas Concannon, who leads the FSA's England Fans' Embassy, said: “If fans are successful in obtaining a category four ticket from the first game to the last, that could set them back $3,180 at least. That is more than double what Qatar cost.

“Combined with travel to the Americas and accommodation, this will be the most expensive World Cup for match-going fans we've ever seen by some distance. A healthy allocation of the lowest category of tickets should be made available to participating nations that are not affected by host city location or dynamic pricing.

“Additionally, participating nation tickets should be located in key areas directly behind the goals to provide the best possible backing to their teams.

“We'd urge the FA to work with other nations around the world to put pressure on FIFA to keep this World Cup financially accessible for match-going fans.”

The director of Fans Supporters Europe, Ronan Evain, also spoke out against the high prices.

“FIFA is setting prices so high that it making the message crystal clear: this is a World Cup for the middle class westerners and the happy few from the rest of the world that can somehow enter the US,” he said in a statement.

“This is not “make football truly global”, this is the privatisation of what was once a tournament open to all. What FIFA's leadership seems to be unable to understand, is that it needs fans in the stands. It needs the life, the atmosphere, the colours, the diversity. None of this exists when you set such prices.”

FIFA spokespeople did not respond on Thursday evening to messages seeking an explanation for the governing body's decision to charge the two 15 per cent fees.

Responding after publication, FIFA said: “As acknowledged by external ticketing experts, resale fees align with industry trends across various sports and entertainment sectors.

“The fact that secondary market activity is legal in certain markets renders it necessary to have a ticketing model that reflects our responsibility to provide secure access to fans, while at the same time ensuring as much value as possible is retained as the more income is generated via ticket sales, the more FIFA funds are invested back into football.”

“FIFA can confirm that it will retain ringfenced allocations that are set aside for specific fan categories and that these allocations will be set at a fixed price,” a spokesperson added.

The 48 teams participating in the 2026 FIFA World Cup got a look at yesterday at the ball they'll be trying to put in the back of the net next summer.

On Thursday, October 2, FIFA and adidas unveiled the “Trionda” match ball for the tournament on FIFA's website and social media channels with a little help from mascots Maple, Zayu and Clutch.

🌟 Trionda 🌟#WeAre26 #FIFAWorldCup

The Trionda — a name derived from Spanish for “three waves” — ball is composed of just four white panels, which are adorned with swirling red, green, and blue designs to represent each of the three North American host countries. The red swirls feature maple leaves, the blue swirls feature stars, and the green swirls have an Aztec eagle design. “These panels connect to form a triangle in the centre of the ball in a nod to the historic union of the three host nations,” FIFA said in its press release. Gold embellishments throughout the designs pay homage to the World Cup trophy.

“The Official Match Ball for the FIFA World Cup 26 is here and it's a beauty! I am happy and proud to present TRIONDA. adidas have created another iconic FIFA World Cup ball, with the design embodying the unity and passion of next year's host nations Canada, Mexico, and the United States. I can't wait to see this beautiful ball hitting the back of the net. The countdown to the greatest FIFA World Cup ever is on – and the ball is rolling!”

Along with the design, the Trionda model offers several performance innovations. “The four-panel construction incorporates intentionally deep seams, creating a surface that produces optimal in-flight stability by ensuring sufficient and evenly distributed drag as the ball travels through the air,” FIFA says. “Additionally, embossed icons that are only visible up close elevate grip when striking or dribbling the ball in wet or humid conditions.” The panels are thermal bonded, giving the ball a more predictable trajectory, better touch and lower water uptake.

Two versions of the Trionda are currently available for purchase on FIFA's official online store: the pro version ($170 USD) and the competition version ($60 USD).

Trionda is the 15th official World Cup match ball that adidas has manufactured, dating back to the 1970 tournament in Mexico.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup kicks off on June 11, 2026, at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City. The final is slated for July 19 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Other matches will be held in Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, Vancouver, Dallas, Guadalajara, Houston, Kansas City, Monterrey, Atlanta, Boston, Miami, Philadelphia, and Toronto.

This will be the first World Cup contested under a new 48-team format. So far, 18 teams have qualified for the tournament, including the three host nations, who will all play their group stage matches on home soil. The draw to determine the groups will take place on December 5 in Washington, D.C.

Pep Guardiola has cautioned Manchester City supporters that star midfielder Rodri (29) may not return to his peak levels until next summer's World Cup.

The Spain international, who was sidelined for the majority of last season with an ACL injury, has made just eight appearances for club and country this term as he continues his gradual return to full fitness. Rodri featured for 61 minutes in City's Champions League draw with Monaco on Wednesday, but Guardiola insists the 29-year-old must be given time to rediscover his rhythm.

Speaking to Sky Sports, the City boss explained: “Rodri, I said to him, he maybe struggled to understand it, it's not about six months, seven months, eight months. ‘Oh, I'll play and be the Rodri I was before.' No. In the World Cup will be the best Rodri, and the next season will be the best Rodri. This season will be how you handle it, step by step.”

Guardiola added that the physical toll of a year on the treatment table cannot be underestimated, emphasising that rhythm and sharpness only return through consistent match play. For City, the challenge will be balancing patience with their reliance on Rodri's influence at the heart of midfield.

City next face Brentford away from home on Sunday.

FOXBOROUGH, Mass. (October 3, 2025) – New England Revolution midfielder Eric Klein has been called-up to the United States Under-20 Men's National Team for its upcoming training camp in San Pedro Del Pinatar, Spain from October 6-15, 2025. Klein is among 12 MLS-based players included in Head Coach Rob Valentino's roster comprised of players born in 2006 or later.

During camp, the U-20s will play a pair of matches at Pinatar Arena, facing the Finland Under-21 side on Friday, Oct. 10 (9:00 a.m. ET) before taking on Elche B on Tuesday, Oct. 14 (10:00 a.m. ET). Klein is one of five Revolution players thus far called up for international duty during the October window, joining Peyton Miller (U.S. U-20 – FIFA U-20 World Cup), Matt Turner (United States), Allan Oyirwoth (Uganda), and Dor Turgeman (Israel).

Additionally, four players from the New England Revolution's Pro Player Pathway have received international call-ups for the October FIFA window. Revolution II forward Alex Monis (Philippines) and midfielder Cristiano Oliveira (United States U-17) will join their respective national teams, while Revolution Academy forwards Makai Wells (United States U-17) and Paolo Tornberg Ayala (El Salvador U-16) have also been selected for international duty.

Klein, 18, earns his first youth international call-up at any age level. The 2024 Revolution Academy Player of the Year is completing his first professional season after signing as the 15th Homegrown Player in Revolution history on May 23 and making his MLS debut eight days later. For the first team, Klein has logged a pair of substitute appearances in regular season play and saw action in both matches during the 2025 U.S. Open Cup campaign.

The Homegrown midfielder made his professional debut with Revolution II in MLS NEXT Pro in July 2023 and was the team's leader in minutes played in 2024 before inking his first contract last fall. This season, Klein has appeared in 12 MLS NEXT Pro matches, tallying one assist. Prior to joining the pro ranks, the Manheim, Penn. native joined the Revolution Academy in 2022 as part of the club's residency program.

Monis joins the Philippines Senior Men's National Team for the final round of AFC Asian Cup 2027 Qualifiers. Monis and the Philippines will take on Timor Leste in Australia on Thursday, Oct. 9 (5:30 a.m. ET), before returning home for the second leg on Tuesday, Oct. 14 (7:00 a.m. ET). The Philippines enter the third-round qualifiers in second place of Group A with an unbeaten 1-0-1 record through the opening two matches of the final round. The top team in each group will earn an automatic berth to the 2027 AFC Asian Cup, set to take place in Saudi Arabia (Jan. 7 – Feb. 5).

The 22-year-old winger owns 14 international caps and two assists with the Philippines senior squad. Monis most recently made three starts with the Philippines U-23 side in AFC U-23 Asian Cup Qualifiers last month. Now in his second season with Revolution II, Monis has logged one goal and one assist through 15 regular season MLS NEXT Pro appearances, including eight starts.

Oliveira, a Somerville, Mass. native will join The Stars & Stripes for a domestic training camp in Fayetteville, Georgia at the U-17 level, under Head Coach Gonzalo Segares. The camp is the team's last gathering before Segares selects his final 21-player roster for the 2025 FIFA U-17 World Cup this November in Qatar. This past February, Oliveira tallied one goal across three appearances with the U.S. U-17 squad at the Concacaf U-17 Championship.

The Revolution Academy alum earned his first team debut in May, appearing in the U.S. Open Cup Round of 32 match at Rhode Island FC and scoring the game-winning goal in the 88th minute to send New England into the Round of 16. In July, Oliveira tallied a goal in his starting shift in the 2025 MLS NEXT All-Star Game in Austin, Texas. With Revolution II, Oliveira has recorded five goals and one assist over 33 MLS NEXT Pro career appearances, including 27 starts.

Wells, 16, receives his second selection to represent the U.S. at the U-17 level, and will travel to San Pedro del Pinatar, Spain for an international training camp. A recent addition to the Revolution Academy, Wells previously took part in a domestic identity training camp last month with the U.S. U-17s. In MLS NEXT action, Wells has logged one assist across two appearances to open his debut Revolution Academy campaign. The forward made his professional debut with Revolution II on August 31 against Chicago Fire FC II, appearing off the bench as a late second-half substitute.

Tornberg Ayala, 16, earns his first call-up to the El Salvador U-16 Men's National Team, to participate in the U-16 UNCAF FIFA Forward Tournament (Sept. 30 – Oct. 10) at the Ernesto Villa Sports Center Stadium in Guatemala City. In the 2024-25 MLS NEXT campaign, the Revere, Mass. native recorded seven goals and a team-high 10 assists with the Revolution Academy's U-16 side. Now with the U-18s, Tornberg Ayala has tallied one goal and one assist over four matches played in the new campaign.

RANCAGUA, Chile (October 2, 2025) – Zavier Gozo, Brooklyn Raines and Marcos Zambrano each tallied in the dying moments to lift the U.S. U-20 Men's National Team to an emphatic 3-0 win against France in the team's second match of the 2025 FIFA U-20 World Cup. With the win, the U.S. sits atop Group E with six points from two matches. The USA closes out the group stage against South Africa on Sunday, Oct. 5 (4 p.m. ET; FS2, Telemundo) and can guarantee the top spot with a win or draw. 

In a match that looked destined to end scoreless, despite a hard push from the young Americans in the second half, the USA saved its best for last, beginning in the 85th minute. Playing forward out of the back, Peyton Miler received the ball at midfield and alertly slotted a ball through down the right wing for Luke Brennan who broke into the box and lofted a picture-perfect cross for Gozo to nod home at the left post. 

Three minutes later, Raines pressed and forced a turnover at midfield before pushing the ball to Gozo. Raines continued his run forward and latched onto the end of a pass in the box before tucking a low, right-footed effort past France ‘keeper Lisandru Olmeta in the 88th minute.

The USA wasn't satisfied with two and bagged one more in the second minute of second-half stoppage time. Substitute Matthew Corcoran played a looping ball over the top for Miller who chested down on the right before playing a centering pass for Gozo. The substitute attacker slid through but saw his close-range attempt rattle the cross bar. The ball rebounded back for Zambrano who coolly finished into the left side of the net to cap the scoring at 3-0. 

U.S. head coach Marko Mitrović made two changes from the Starting XI that faced New Caledonia on Monday, inserting Taha Habroune and Peyton Miller. To start the match, both teams alternated spells of possession, but it was the USA who spent slightly more the time on the ball while the French defense was satisfied with staying back to prevent U.S. runs behind the defensive line. Those tactics worked for the French, until they didn't.

The USA's first real chance came in the 18th minute. Miller ran down the left toward the touchline before passing back to an onrushing Nolan Norris. The defender struck the ball well, but French goalkeeper Lisandru Olmeta made a nice save.

The next best opportunity for either team wouldn't come until the 35th minute. Niko Tarkiris won the ball out of a gaggle of players and sent it wide to Frankie Westfield. With time and no defender around him, Westfield fired a shot on target, but it was easily smothered by the French goalkeeper.

The best chance of the first half for Les Bleus came in the 39th minute. Lucas Michal slid a pass from the left side of the box to Rabby Nzingoula. With one touch, Nzingoula found Mayssam Benama running toward the six-yard box, but Benama's shot barely challenged U.S. ‘keeper Adam Beaudry, who easily collected the ball.

At the hour mark, Habroune brought the ball down the left sideline, beating his defender before finding Tsakiris running into the box. The midfielder cut it back toward the middle of the box, where Cremaschi smacked a first-time effort that seemed headed into the net, only to be denied once again by Olmeta.

It was Habroune again causing issues for the French defense in the 70th minute, dribbling down the left side again and sending a dangerous ball into the box. This time it was Cremaschi trying to get to the end of it, but the goalkeeper smothered the pass just before the U.S. attacker could reach the ball.

France had its most dangerous chance moments later in the 72nd minute. Tadjidine Mmadi won the ball in the midfield and dribbled into the teeth of the U.S. defense before sending a pass wide left to Michel. The forward struck a shot from near the top corner of the box, but Beaudry punched it away.

The USA had withstood the danger and then cracked opened the France defense as Gozo, Raines and Zambrano tallied three goals inside seven minutes to claim an emphatic 3-0 victory.

The content reaffirmed just how much that Djokovic and Sabalenka have developed a close bond both on and off the court as they've each chased tennis' biggest prizes.But the 24-time Grand Slam singles champion has also become tight with Frangulis, the founder and CEO of the smoothie company Oakberry. The two are joint investors in the French football club Le Mans, along with motorsport stars Felipe Massa and Kevin Magnussen.“Novak has been an idol of mine forever, long before we became friends. I always admired him for his achievements,” Frangulis said in an interview after they became business partners.“I love being around Novak and learning from him. And I think it's good for him, too. He's been on a tennis court his whole life, so exploring new areas is exciting for him. He's a great listener, very curious about business, politics, everything. That's why any conversation with him is always engaging and fun.”

Throughout more than 20 seasons on the ATP Tour, Rafael Nadal forged a legendary career that included countless titles, records and landmark achievements. Now, off the court, the 22-time major champion continues to accumulate honours.

On Friday, Nadal was made doctor honoris causa by the University of Salamanca, becoming the first athlete the institution has bestowed the honour upon.

Donning a blue mortarboard, Nadal took an oath before the University Senate and received the medal that incorporates him into the Official Association of Doctoral Degrees of the University of Salamanca. The Spaniard gave a speech to the assembly hall in a ceremony that was attended by his wife Mery Perello, his parents Sebastian and Ana Maria, and his sister Maribel.


“It makes me so proud and grateful to receive the title of Honoris Causa from the oldest University in Spain and one of the oldest in the world; a place where, since the eighteenth century, humanism, critical thinking and intellectual freedom have illuminated the whole of humanity,” he began.


“As you all know, I did not follow a traditional academic education like most of you here; my education was different.

Nadal referred to his journey to becoming a professional tennis player. The Spaniard said: “My life was played out at tournaments and on tennis courts, travelling the five continents, competing and learning from the sport and from the experiences that came with all of that. Therefore, this recognition is not only a privilege for me, it is also a demonstration of respect for sport and what it represents to society.”


The former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings set himself apart not only because of his competitive nature and ability to enjoy so much success throughout his professional career, but also because of his exemplary behaviour on and off the court. Nadal spoke of sport as a school of life.


“Ever since I was a boy, sport has been my own college and, in some ways, my own university. What I learned on the courts has always been with me, both in tennis and away from it. Sport taught me the value of discipline. You get nothing without daily hard work, without commitment and without taking care of the smaller details,” he said.


“Sport also taught me not to feel that I am better than anyone, because in competitions and in tournaments, as in life, nobody wins every time."




Continuing with the theme of education, Nadal spoke of a lesson he learned when he was a boy: “In 2002, when I was still a teenager, I was very excited about a particular goal; to play in the junior Roland Garros tournament for the first time. At the time, I already had some ATP points, I'd played in international tournaments and I thought that event was a great chance to compete on one of the most emblematic stages in my sport. Imagine a 15-year-old's excitement at playing in Paris.


“However, my parents told me I could not play, because it was during exam season. For me, at 15, it was very difficult to understand. Despite my disappointment, my parents were not to be moved and in the end, I didn't play in the tournament. With time, I learned that the decision was a great lesson and now I thank them because they helped me finish my compulsory education and they taught me that no goal comes before values and education.”


Nadal's visit to the city of Salamanca aroused great expectations from the early hours of the morning, when hundreds of people began to gather near the university in the hope of an opportunity to get a glimpse of the Spanish legend.


The honour granted by the University of Salamanca follows others to be bestowed upon the tennis icon, such as the Prince of Asturias Award for Sport in 2008, the Royal Order of Sports Merit, the Medal of Merit in Labour and the National Sports Award, which he has won several times.

Carlos Alcaraz's only true competitor recognizes the danger in complacency.ByPeter BodoPublished Oct 03, 2025 copy_link

Jannik Sinner may have failed to deliver on the expectations of many, including his own, in the recent US Open final. But in his post-final press briefing, he delivered a startlingly transparent—and completely unexpected—assessment of his shortcomings.This is something Grand Slam champions simply do not do when relegated to the co-pilot seat. And it speaks to the evolution of the game.“I was very predictable today,” Sinner said, teeing up what would develop into a monologue of sorts—one that seemed out of character for the shy, 24-year-old, already four-time major champion. “On the court, he (Carlos Alcaraz) did many things, he changed up the game. That's also his style of how he plays. Now it's going to be on me if I want to make changes or not.”

It was an accurate assessment, the meat of which we'll take a closer look at later. But contrast the essence of those words with one of the most famous pronouncements in tennis history, made by Jimmy Connors in 1978 after he lost his second consecutive Wimbledon final to nemesis Bjorn Borg: “I'll follow him to the ends of the earth,” Connors declared, in a headline generating promise.But meanwhile, Connors spurned questions about the glaring hole in his game, his weak forehand approach shot. My forehand, weak?

But consider gentleman Roger Federer's bland reaction in 2008, when Rafael Nadal demolished him for the third Roland Garros final, allowing the world No. 1 just four games in three sets: “I was hoping for a better outcome, no doubt, you know,” Federer said. “But Rafa played well today, made it hard for me, and, yeah, was better.”Asked to analyze the match, Federer replied, “Look, it doesn't matter now what happened, you know. I mean, the match is over; clay-court season is over. I'm just here to answer some questions, not to analyze the match. I wish it was a different outcome.”Granted, besting Nadal on Parisian clay has probably been the toughest assignment in tennis. But Federer was just following the conventional wisdom to avoid the confession of a weakness at all costs, or a need to make changes. Most elite champions prefer to die with their boots on, their self-affirming mantra always the same platitude: “I just need to play my game, it's good enough to beat anyone.”Well, Sinner seemed to acknowledge in New York, it will not.

In the US Open final, Sinner's predictability was accompanied by atypical inconsistency. He made 28 unforced errors, four more than Alcaraz with his high-risk game. He also hit 20 fewer winners (41-21).© Associated Press

It's a different game now. It demands greater watchfulness, flexibility and a constant willingness to make tweaks and changes—even from those at the pinnacle of the sport. This is why the upcoming clashes between Sinner and Alcaraz in 2026 are so promising. But don't expect striking, visible changes. The hard work will be done at the margins of technique and conception.Sinner's avowal of “predictability” in New York was just the tip of a verbal iceberg. He went on to provide a laundry list of things he did not do during his matches—attacking the net, employing slice and drop shots—which left him unprepared to deal with the dazzling variety Alcaraz used to yank Sinner out of his comfort zone. No mean feat, that.Sinner said that he's willing to take some losses as he tries to round out his game and expand his palette. It's partly because, in addition to his Alcaraz problem (their latest clash saw the Spaniard supplant the Italian for No. 1, and take a 10-5 lead in their head-to-head), Sinner simply wants to be a better tennis player. It's something he's often said even in happier times, during the 27-match hard court winning streak he carried into the US Open final.Sinner recognizes the danger in complacency. He said: “One thing is, when the scorelines of [previous] matches are comfortable but you always do the same things [it's dangerous].

Keep in mind that even supreme competitors have off days. Based on the stats of the US Open final, Sinner's predictability was accompanied by atypical inconsistency. He made 28 unforced errors, four more than Alcaraz with his high-risk game. He also hit 20 fewer winners (41-21). Alcaraz won the battle of the basic stats in New York. Yet just weeks earlier at Wimbledon, Sinner had an edge in almost every category.The larger issue at play here is how each man wins his points.According to metrics developed by TennisViz in partnership with Tennis Data Innovations (TDI) specifically for ATP broadcasts, Sinner leads the ATP Tour in the “Core Shots” category, which measures standard topspin strokes hit through an opponent's baseline. Alcaraz doesn't even appear in the Top 10 on that list. It's because he doesn't hit enough coast-to-coast groundstrokes.🖥️📲Stream Sinner's match with Altmaier in Shanghai LIVE, Saturday, October 4, at 6:30 a.m. ETCore Shots is but one component in a larger metric and data set called “Shot Variety,” which measures the extent to which a player mixes up tactics—drop shots, volleys, topspin angles, slice. The co-leaders in the category are Daniel Evans and Alexander Bublik, both players hitting roughly 47 percent of their shots with variation.The data providers do not publish a Shot Variety ranking, or stats for all individuals (their data is proprietary), but an AI trawl by ChatGPT suggests Alcaraz comes out at roughly 30 percent (25–35%) on the variety scale, notably above the tour average, while Sinner's variety count works out to roughly 20 percent (18-22%) of his shots. That's right around the tour average.It's also legitimate to ask if Sinner isn't just overreacting to his recent Grand Slam loss: Did he expect to beat Alcaraz with those stats that Sunday afternoon? Besides, incorporating greater variety doesn't guarantee greater success, and it may even play into Alcaraz's hands. The Sinner camp must be thinking long and hard about this.

“I hope to see you again next year.” 👋👀Jannik Sinner caps off another successful year in Beijing! #2025ChinaOpen pic.twitter.com/arXeJeFyDt

Nevertheless, Sinner appears to have crossed a Rubicon. He began expanding his palette in his first post-US Open appearance last week, in Beijing (which he won). After dropping a set in his second-round win over Terence Atmane, he admitted, “At this moment, I'm spending a lot of mental energy. Today it was 80 percent me (my usual tennis) and 20 percent new things (mainly having to do with his serve).“Maybe I should do 95 percent my tennis and 5 percent experiments, and do them in quieter moments. But there are so many positive things and it's part of the process.”This is a new era in tennis. The long tradition of Grand Slam champions who live in regal denial about vulnerabilities, or are loath to look weak by admitting to them, may be coming to an end. The margins between success and failure, between the good and the great, grow ever slimmer—and Jannik Sinner is leading the charge into this future.

Novak Djokovic is not only a master on the tennis court, but also a master of personal connection. Whether it's Italian in Rome, French in Paris, or Mandarin in Shanghai, the 38-year-old knows how to bring cultures together with a few heartfelt words.

After his opening-round win against Marin Cilic at the Rolex Paris Masters on Friday night, Djokovic won the crowd all over again. He had fans buzzing when he spoke to them in Chinese and signed the camera lens with a local character.

“Those are some of the phrases I've learned over the years, so I have to update my knowledge of the Chinese language,” said Djokovic, the former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings. “It's always a pleasure to play in front of such passionate fans. People have been giving me lots of love and support over the years, so I try to give them back with good tennis, and also a basic knowledge of Chinese language with a few phrases.

“It was amazing to see the packed house tonight. I know it's a national holiday and weekend, but for the first match, it's incredible. It's one of the most beautiful stadiums, and I totally enjoy myself.”

That mutual affection has been building for more than a decade. Djokovic is this week making his 11th appearance in Shanghai, where he has lifted the trophy a record four times. He even left his mark in 2008, winning the Nitto ATP Finals (then the Masters Tennis Cup) during its Shanghai chapter.

Djokovic wows Shanghai crowd with local character: 

This particular reunion, however, came with an extra challenge: the humidity. Djokovic found himself sweating through grips faster than usual, resorting to sawdust for traction.

“It's crazy humid, to be honest. I don't recall the weather being so humid in China,” Djokovic said. “I don't remember the last time I played in humidity like this. It is what it is… It's the same for me, my opponent, and every other player. You just have to accept it, deal with it. A lot of sweating. The laundry bills will be quite high this week, but that's okay.”

Now, Djokovic shifts his focus to a third-round meeting with Yannick Hanfmann, who acclimated well to the conditions. The German has come through four matches, including qualifying, and will aim to unload his heavy hitting on Djokovic.

As well as taking a 1-0 Lexus ATP Head2Head lead into their clash, however, Djokovic will also take confidence from his own serving performance on Friday against Cilic. The Serbian saved all four break points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats, and hit 10 aces to Cilic's six.

“I think the serving performance was great. I aced him more than he aced me, which is not very common when you play somebody like Marin,” said Djokovic. “He has got one of the best serves in the world. He was very aggressive. When he feels the ball, he plays so flat, so deep.

“I dug myself out of trouble with the serve and some good shots. But it was a tough match for me, no doubt about it. It's good sometimes to kick-start the tournament with such a match.”

Separated by 11 years, Jessica Pegula and Linda Noskova meet in Beijing's final four. Who holds the edge? We make the case for both players.

Separated by 11 years, they come together from opposite sides of two traditional powers in women's tennis.

Jessica Pegula, at 31, is one of three Americans to reach the semifinals at this China Open -- and the second oldest ever.

“I've been asked this question a lot in the past two years, because there's a lot of us doing really, really well,” the No. 5-seeded Pegula said. “I think we're all kind of pushing each other, motivating each other, inspiring each other. It's kind of taken the pressure off that there's not just one person carrying the torch.”

Linda Noskova, at 20, is the youngest Czech Republic player to reach the semifinals of a WTA 1000 event since the format introduction in 2009.

“It's definitely tough to have so many players from Czechia play before me -- there's a lot of us,” Noskova said. “That is a great statistic.”

Seeded No. 26, Noskova defeated Sonay Kartal 6-3, 6-4 in a Friday quarterfinal match to advance to her first WTA 1000 semifinal. Later, Pegula converted her third match point, coming back to defeat No. 16 seed Emma Navarro 6-7 (2), 6-2, 6-1.

Beijing semifinalists locked in 🔐@ChinaOpen | #2025ChinaOpen pic.twitter.com/dVWPM1RV8z

Saturday's 6 p.m. semifinal (6 a.m. ET) will be their third meeting this year. Back in February, Noskova won a Round of 16 match in Dubai in straight sets and roughly four months later Pegula took a Bad Homburg semifinal in three sets.

Let's take a closer look:

The Case for Pegula

Pegula will be the first to tell you that these slow courts in Beijing do not play to her strengths.

That said, she's found a way to survive and advance. Pegula dropped the first set to Emma Raducanu in the third round and rallied to win in three -- it was 6-0 in the third. After Marta Kostyuk won a second-set tiebreak, Pegula responded with a 6-1 final frame. After failing to convert six set points in the opening frame, she duplicated that result to close out Navarro. 

That's a remarkable 18 of 20 games in the crucible of the deciding set, as good a definition of clutch as you're going to find. Pegula's done it by making a series of small adjustments.

Coming in clutch 💪@JPegula | #2025ChinaOpen pic.twitter.com/2Rr2z9Aw0K

“Honestly, with me this week, I've been trying to slow things down,” Pegula said after defeating Navarro. “It sounds counterintuitive, but actually do less. And that kind of helps me find my flow a little bit, especially in these slow conditions that maybe doesn't favor me as much. 

“I was just telling myself, ‘Don't overdo the strategy.' That allowed me to relax a little bit.”

Thinking without overthinking has allowed Pegula to win 66 three-set matches since the turn of the century -- only Aryna Sabalenka  (68) has won more in that span. This is relevant because three of the five sets Pegula has played against Noskova have required seven games to win -- a sign that this one might go the distance.

Pegula is the quintessential professional. Her three titles this year (Austin, Charleston and Bad Homburg) have come on three different surfaces. And here she is in Beijing, thriving in heavy conditions.

“She's a big, powerful hitter -- big serve,” Pegula said of Noskova. “It's tough playing someone like that because sometimes I feel like you have to wait for your chance and if you do get a chance and you don't execute it can kind of slip away.

“I'm interested to see how it goes with the conditions.”

The Case for Noskova

This is a milestone moment for Noskova -- and she knows it.

“I was on the edge of the Top 30, Top 35, trying to find my place,” Noskova said of her play earlier this year. “I think it was a couple of months ago when I thought, ‘It would be nice to break into the Top 20 by the end of the year.'”

She's already collected 390 ranking points here and a semifinal victory would run that total to 650 points, enough to crack the Top 20 next week.

Noskova, who has won four straight matches for the first time since the Prague Open back in July, is playing with confidence. This is her fourth WTA-level semifinal this year, following Abu Dhabi, Bad Homburg and Prague.

Three years ago, when she reached the semifinals in Prague at the age of 17, Noskova jumped into the Top 100 and supplanted Gauff as the youngest member of that exclusive club. She's currently the No. 2 player for the Czech Republic, not far behind Karolina Muchova and ahead of major champions Barbora Krejcikova and Marketa Vondrousova.

Noskova is also the third youngest woman in the PIF WTA Rankings Top 35, after No. 5 Mirra Andreeva (18) and No. 23 Victoria Mboko (19).

The upside of that youth is that Noskova is playing a fearless brand of tennis. Against Pegula, she needs to take care of her hefty serve and limit the double faults that sometimes creep into her game.

Noskova remembers the last time they played, in Bad Homburg.

“That was tough match for me,” she said. “I had some leads, but I couldn't finish out the match. This [the win over Kartal] was my best match here so far. I felt really great on court.

“Feeling my game, just want to stay on my path.”

Here's another compelling reason to like Noskova:

After promising results in Abu Dhabi (3-1), Doha (2-1), Dubai (3-1) and now Beijing (4-0), no woman -- not even Iga Swiatek -- has compiled more than her 12 match wins in Asia.

 

Separated by 11 years, Jessica Pegula and Linda Noskova meet in Beijing's final four. Who holds the edge? We make the case for both players.

Jessica Pegula is through to the China Open semifinals for the first time in her career after coming from behind to defeat fellow American Emma Navarro 6-7 (2), 6-2, 6-1 in just over two hours on Friday in Beijing. She will face Linda Noskova for a spot in the final.

Jessica Pegula could have unraveled Friday in Beijing after what was, for all intents and purposes, a first-set collapse in her quarterfinal match against fellow American Emma Navarro.

Beijing: Scores | Draws | Order of play

The No. 5 seed twice served for the set and held six set points, but Navarro saved them all and took the opener in a tiebreak.

Pegula's response? One word: relax.

“I told myself not to get too frustrated,” Pegula said after the match. “Just stay calm, try to relax a little bit, and not try as hard to execute the game plan. That kind of allowed me to play more free.”

Her approach paid off. Pegula dominated the final two sets to win 6-7 (2), 6-2, 6-1 in just over two hours, advancing to the China Open semifinals for the first time.

After the first set wrapped just shy of an hour, Pegula needed only half that to level the match, racing out to a 4-1 and leaving the early stumble behind.

She closed out the second set drama-free, backed by an almost untouchable serve. She won nearly 80% of her first-serve points and an impressive 71% of her second serve. After facing seven break points in the first set, she didn't face a single one in the second.

From that point on, Pegula held serve in every game. 

The final set was a carbon-copy of the second. She broke for a 3-1 lead, just as she did in the set prior and proceeded to serve out the match. Navarro applied a touch of late pressure, earning three break points in the following game and saving two match points, but Pegula held firm to complete the comeback.

The win sets up a semifinal clash with 20-year-old Linda Noskova, the lone non-American left in the draw.

Pegula and Noskova have met twice this year, splitting the head-to-head in two tightly contested matches. Pegula won their most recent encounter in the Bad Homburg semifinals in June, rallying from a set down. Coincidentally, she entered that match on the heels of a three-set quarterfinal win over none other than Emma Navarro.

Noskova claimed their first and only hard-court meeting in February, defeating Pegula in straight sets at the WTA 1000 event in Dubai, sealing the win in a second-set tiebreak.

The winner this time around will advance to face either Coco Gauff or Amanda Anisimova for the China Open title.

But first, enjoy these fast facts from Pegula's comeback win:

The ATP has finalised profit-sharing distributions to round out total ATP Masters 1000 compensation for the 2024 season, today announcing the allocation of the record $18.3 million profit-sharing payout to players.

Calculated on a value-per-point basis, the 186 players who earned PIF ATP Rankings points at Masters 1000 events in 2024 will receive a share, with two players — Jannik Sinner ($1,333,770) and Alexander Zverev ($1,228,472) — earning more than $1 million each. Rounding out the top five on the distributions list are Andrey Rublev ($698,474), Carlos Alcaraz ($600,197) and Daniil Medvedev ($589,667).

Prize money is only half the story. The ATP's 50-50 profit-sharing formula splits profits generated at Masters 1000s – above on-site base prize money – equally between players and tournaments. This money is in addition to the 2024 Fixed Bonus Pool of $20.5 million awarded to the Top 30 players across the Masters 1000 events and the Nitto ATP Finals.

The $18.3 million distribution is 2.7x higher than in 2023. Profit sharing, which was first introduced in 2022, is a key tenet of ATP's OneVision strategic plan, which includes aligning the financial interests of players and tournaments and giving both parties an equal share in the sport's success.

Under OneVision, ATP is committed to expanding earning opportunities and increasing overall earnings across the ATP Tour.

View below the full profit-sharing distribution for all players who qualified in 2024.

Keys' qualification comes off the heels of the best season of her career, highlighted capturing the first Grand Slam title of her career at the Australian Open. And she ran the gauntlet to do it, defeating Swiatek in the semifinals (saving a match point) and Sabalenka in the final to become the first woman to beat both of the Top 2 at a Grand Slam since 2009 (Svetlana Kuznetsova at Roland Garros).That run was part of a career-best 16-match winning streak between January and March that also included winning a WTA 500 lead-up title in Auckland and reaching the semifinals of Indian Wells, where her streak was ultimately snapped by Sabalenka.In addition to those results, she's also reached one more semifinal this year at Queen's Club and four more quarterfinals at Auckland, Madrid, Roland Garros (where she fell to Gauff) and Montreal.On January 27th, after the Australian Open, Keys jumped back to her previous career-high of No. 7 on the WTA rankings, which she had first reached in 2016. She then set a new career-high of No. 6 two weeks later on February 10th, then another new career-high of No. 5—her Top 5 debut—two weeks after that, on February 24th.

Keys will be playing the WTA Finals for the second time in her career, having played the event in 2016 when it was held in Singapore.That year she was eliminated in the round-robin stage after putting together a 1-2 win-loss record, beating Dominika Cibulkova but falling to Angelique Kerber and Simona Halep. She was actually part of a three-way tie at 1-2 with Cibulkova and Halep, with Kerber going 3-0, and Cibulkova advanced to the semifinals with Kerber on sets.Cibulkova went on to win the title, defeating Kerber in the final.Now, nine years and five locations later (Shenzhen, Guadalajara, Fort Worth, Cancun and Riyadh), Keys has another shot at year-end glory.

From defending champion Coco Gauff to resurgent Madison Keys and first-time qualifier Amanda Anisimova, the trio's collective rise sets the stage for an American showcase at the season's grand finale.

Three Americans navigated vastly different paths, but secured their invitations to the ultimate destination.

This week at the China Open, Coco Gauff, Madison Keys and Amanda Anisimova qualified for the PIF WTA Finals in Riyadh. They are three competitors at three stages of their careers, staging a red-white-and-blue revival, united by the thread of uncommon resilience.

And so, the singles field in Riyadh is shaping up. We now have five of the eight competitors, after No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka and No. 2 Iga Swiatek.

We break down the freshly minted qualifiers:

She officially qualified by reaching the quarterfinals at this tournament in which she has enjoyed unprecedented success. Gauff is into the semifinals and has won 14 of her 15 matches at the China Open, something no other woman has done in the more than two decades of this event.

“That's pretty cool,” Gauff told reporters afterward. “To see a checkmark by your name definitely gives you a sense of relief for sure.”

A berth in Riyadh is the ultimate payoff after an up-and-down year for Gauff. Back in the spring, seven years after winning the junior title at Roland Garros she was the champion of the senior division.

The grass season did not go as well. Gauff lost her only two matches, in Berlin and at Wimbledon, and when she transitioned to the North American hard-court season double faults became an issue. Gauff turned to mechanics expert Gavin MacMillan, who solved Aryna Sabalenka's serving woes. After winning her first three matches at the US Open, Gauff fell in the fourth round to Naomi Osaka.

The China swing comes at just the right time.

A year ago, Gauff took the title in Beijing and, including Wuhan, wound up winning nine of 10 matches to enter the WTA Finals in peak form. After losing her opening match in Riyadh, Gauff defeated four Top 10 players, including No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka and No. 2 Iga Swiatek to win the year-end title.

The way she's playing, it could be a scenario that repeats itself. Gauff has a chance to go back-to-back at the WTA Finals since Serena Williams more than a decade ago. She could become the only active player to collect multiple titles at the year-end championships.

Currently No. 5 in the Race standings, Keys qualified when Gauff reached the semifinals. She becomes the fourth singles player lined up for Riyadh, due to her breakthrough win at the Australian Open. According to the qualification guidelines, if a major champion finishes the regular season in the Top 20 -- they're in.

Keys withdrew from Beijing and Wuhan with an injury.

Back in January, on the cusp of her 30th birthday, Keys won her first Grand Slam singles title in Melbourne. She became the oldest woman to defeat the World No. 1 (Sabalenka) and No. 2 (Swiatek) in the last two matches of a major in the half-century of rankings records.

After years of stressing over her lack of a Grand Slam title, Keys finally came to understand that, even in the context of professional tennis, she'd produced an extraordinary career. And that realization freed her to take the next step.

Nine years ago, at the age of 21, Keys found herself in the year-end Singapore field. The two players she lost to -- Simona Halep and Angelique Kerber -- have both retired. But Keys has persevered and contemplates a second year-end challenge.

At the BNP Paribas Open in March, Keys acknowledged that the win in Australia heightened her personal expectations but cautioned restraint.

“It's really important for me and for my team to remember how we got there and what we were doing,” she said. “And I think kind of going back to that, and staying really grounded in that is going to be really important.

“I think the balance of being honest with my expectations rising, but also knowing that I don't think anyone really thrives when you have such a dramatic mind shift so quickly after success.”

After a sizzling, career-best run this summer, Anisimova has been severely tested in Beijing.

She weathered a tiebreak in the third round against Zhang Shuai that required 24 points, then came back from down a set to defeat both Karolina Muchova and Jasmine Paolini. The Thursday win against the Italian sent her into the semifinals and locked down her spot in Riyadh.

It was a display of patience under pressure that Anisimova seems to have increasingly mastered this year.

After losing four straight opening matches in WTA 1000s, Anisimova stepped away from tennis in the spring of 2023. Surrounded by friends and family, she slowly replenished body and soul.

She was No. 442 in the PIF WTA Rankings heading into the 2024 Australian Open, but by the time she arrived in China at the end of the year, she was already inside the Top 50. That set her up for a phenomenal 2025.

Her first WTA 1000 title, a crisp, clean 6-0 sprint through the field in Doha, delivered Anisimova inside the Top 20 for the first time. She reached the fourth round at Roland Garros and the final at Queen's in London.

Anisimova was a quarterfinalist in her previous appearance at Wimbledon and, after missing the tournament twice, she played her way into the finals, defeating Sabalenka in the semifinals. However, Swiatek dispatched her 6-0, 6-0 in the final.

The US Open offered a chance for revenge and Anisimova took it with gusto, throwing down a 6-4, 6-3 win over Swiatek in the quarterfinals and following up with semifinal success over Naomi Osaka. She pushed Sabalenka to a second-set tiebreak before falling in the final.

 “Today I really came out there with, like, not an ounce of fear,” Anisimova said after beating Swiatek. “I feel like I really made a point to myself and also maybe to other people that, like, if you really put a positive mindset out there or just try and work through things, then you can have a positive outcome.”

 

From defending champion Coco Gauff to resurgent Madison Keys and first-time qualifier Amanda Anisimova, the trio's collective rise sets the stage for an American showcase at the season's grand finale.

Novak Djokovic made a winning return to action at the 2025 Rolex Shanghai Masters on Friday, dispatching Marin Cilic, 7-6 (2), 6-4 in his first match since the US Open last month."I think serving performance was great," Djokovic said after the match. "I aced him more than he aced me, which is not very common when you play somebody like Marin. He has got one of the best serves in the world. He was very aggressive. When he feels the ball, he plays so flat, so deep. He's a big guy, and he had clear tactical intention to make me uncomfortable and make me defend, which he did in the first set. I dug myself out of trouble with the serve and some good shots. But, you know, it was a tough match for me, no doubt about it. It's good sometimes to kick start the tournament with such a match."🖥️📲The Match in 15 Minutes: Novak Djokovic def.

Djokovic reached the semifinals of all four major tournaments in 2025 but was unable to add to his already-considerable title haul after injury forced him to retire at the Australian Open followed by losses to Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner.Spurred on by the warm crowd reception on Arthur Ashe Stadium, the former world No. 1 showed no signs of hanging up his racquets and hit the ground running this week in Shanghai, where he reached the final in 2024."The amount of support I've been getting since that year has been incredible in China, both Beijing and Shanghai," Djokovic said in his pre-tournament press conference. "I just love coming back and performing in front of the crowd that always gives me great energy, great vibes. Every practice session it feels like playing a match, honestly, with the amount of people that is there screaming and really willing to show their support and show their love and passion for what I do."So, I feel very welcome, and that's probably the biggest reason why I decided to come here, to be honest with you, because I just feel good playing here, and feel like I'm at home. Probably, outside of my country, the biggest support that I've been getting anywhere in the world."

A clean stat sheet saw Djokovic end the match with 21 winners to just 15 unforced errors.Up next for the four-time Shanghai champion will be German qualifier Yannick Hanfmann, who twice rallied from a set down to score back-to-back victories over Lorenzo Sonego and No. 25 seed Frances Tiafoe.

Stefanos Tsitsipas finds himself in unfamiliar territory heading into this year's Rolex Shanghai Masters.


Normally at this time of the year the former No. 3 in the PIF ATP Rankings is very much in the hunt for a berth at the Nitto ATP Finals, an event he won on debut in 2019, and at which he qualified five straight years through 2023. 

After a near miss last season, the Greek seems destined to again sit out the season finale. He's also been battling a back complaint and heads into the eighth ATP Masters 1000 tournament of the year with a modest 22-18 record on the year, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss index. 

However, the news is not all bad. The 27-year-old is hopeful that recent treatment on his back will allow him to play more freely, and he said that his sometimes-rocky coaching relationship with his father Apostolos is in a very health place. 

 “We have changed our dynamic very much and I'm actually very happy the way we all cooperate and work together now,” Tsitsipas told ATPTour.com. “It's very refreshing as a player to have this relationship with a father. 

 “It's exactly where I wanted it to be for a long time now. And I'm happy. He has adjusted to my needs and I have adjusted to his needs. And we have both created a type of dynamic that is one to be proud of.” 

While open to adding another voice to his coaching team, Tsitsipas said that he has great respect for his father's years of experience in the game. 

 “My dad has been on the tour for a lot of years, even dating back to my mother's playing days. So he has a lot of tennis in his life,” he said. “I'm extremely proud to call him my coach and my father. But first of all, my father. Secondly, my coach. 

 “I definitely see [our current coaching partnership] as something sustainable. I would be interested in the future to add a person in my team that can collaborate and work with my dad. Obviously he's not getting younger, so if I can find the right person, he can be by my dad's side a little bit, with a clear, fresher mindset.  

 “That might also allow my dad to maybe take a step back a little bit to also enjoy life because it's not only tennis. And I've been reminding him and telling him this for a very long time.”








Tsitsipas' resolve has been tested this year. After five Top 10 finishes between 2019-2023, and a No. 11 finish last year, the former World No. 3 has slipped to No. 25 in the PIF ATP Rankings. 

His goals for the final weeks of the season – which include playing the last week of the regular season on home soil in Athens – are measured. 

 “My focus would be a combination of seeing what my back allows me to do now and reconnecting a little bit with the wins,” the two-time Grand Slam finalist said. “Top of my list right now, I would definitely like to see a few matches in a row without back pain.” 

Tsitsipas dismissed reports that he had undergone back surgery, saying that a hospital visit was only for “a special type of examination”. 

 “I won't go into details, but it's something that did help me a lot. I readjusted and fixed my back. So I'm just waiting to see how that responds in matches and how I'm able to compete in a much more healthy state.” 

Tsitsipas, who has played just two Davis Cup matches [in Athens] since the US Open, said that he feels fresh and recharged following vacation time in Greece, where he visited museums and historical sites such as the Athens Acropolis Museum, the Temple of Apollo and the National Gardens. He also practised three times with Novak Djokovic. 

 “Getting to know Novak in a deeper way was nice because on the Tour, you don't have that opportunity," Tsitsipas said. “And I spent a lot of time connecting with my spirit in Greece. I actually had a great time exploring my own country and doing things I found spiritually fulfilling. 

 “I did definitely need that break. I only realised that when I was there. I spent a lot of time with my little sister, my brother Petros, who I always see on the court playing doubles with him. That is something that I lack a little bit in my daily life, a little bit of humanity, especially when you're constantly stressed and chasing points, tournaments, all that. It's important sometimes to take a break and reconnect with your humanity.” 

Tsitsipas, who defeated Djokovic in Shanghai in 2019 en route to his best semi-final finish at the event, opens his campaign Saturday against Portugal's Nuno Borges.

Ben Shelton missed the opportunity to boost his Turin hopes on his return to Tour on Friday, when he lost to former World No. 7 David Goffin in the second round at the Rolex Shanghai Masters. The Belgian earned a 6-2, 6-4 win to capture his second Top 10 win of the season.

Shelton was competing for the first time since he was forced to retire during the third round at the US Open in August due to a left shoulder injury, which he described as ‘the worst ever pain in [my] life'. Upon return, he was slightly off the pace, committing 22 unforced errors to 11 from Goffin, who beat Carlos Alcaraz at the ATP Masters 1000 event in Miami earlier this year.

"From the start, I started to feel really well with my ground strokes," Goffin said. "I took the ball early, I was returning really well and serving really well, like the first round.  I just managed to save a couple of break points, but I think overall I served really well and I played really well after my serve, so I think that was the key to put pressure on Ben.  
But at the end it was tough to finish it, but I made it with a good service game, so I'm really happy."



Shelton owns a 37-19 tour-level record in 2025, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, and has produced some of his best tennis on hard courts this year. The 22-year-old won his maiden ATP Masters 1000 title on the surface in Toronto and also reached the semi-finals at the Australian Open.

Shelton's hard work meant he arrived in Shanghai sixth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin on 3,720 points and in a good spot to make his debut at the Nitto ATP Finals in November. However, the lefty could now be surpassed by seventh-placed Alex de Minaur (3,355) and eighth-placed Lorenzo Musetti (3,345) in the coming days.

Shelton is currently 1,005 points ahead of 10th-placed Felix Auger-Aliassime, who is the first player outside the Top 8 cut, with ninth-placed Jack Draper sidelined for the rest of the year due to injury. Auger-Aliassime plays Chengdu champion Alejandro Tabilo in his Shanghai opener.

Goffin saved all three break points he faced against Shelton and leads the sixth seed 2-0 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series. The 34-year-old, who is a two-time Shanghai quarter-finalist, plays Gabriel Diallo in the third round on Sunday. The Canadian defeated Benjamin Bonzi 6-4, 6-4.

Holger Rune is 14th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin but kept alive his chances of qualifying for the year-end event with a 7-5, 6-4 win against Sebastian Baez. The Dane recovered from squandering a break advantage in the second set to advance. Rune reached the quarter-finals in Tokyo last week and is searching for his first Masters 1000 title since Paris in 2022. He will play Ugo Humbert in the third round after the Frenchman eliminated Jordan Thompson 6-3, 7-6(4).

Yannick Hanfmann poured more misery onto Frances Tiafoe, defeating the American 6-7(9), 6-2, 6-1. Tiafoe has now lost his past five matches and suffered a disappointing third-round exit at the US Open. Hanfmann will play Novak Djokovic or Marin Cilic in the third round.

In an all-Top 10 clash between the No. 4-ranked Anisimova and the No. 8-ranked Paolini, there was very little between them from the start of the match, with Paolini battling back from 5-3 down to sneak out the first set in a tie-break after exactly an hour on court.Anisimova came out swinging in the second set, opening up a 4-0, double-break lead, and eventually closing it out, 6-3, to send it into a third set. She then broke in the first game of the decider.Paolini found her best tennis again from there, breaking right back for 1-all and having all kinds of chances the rest of the way—Anisimova had to fight off a break point serving at 1-2, and another six break points serving at 3-4. But she fended them all off, held for 4-all, broke for 5-4 and then served the match out at love."It had been a while since I'd played her," said Anisimova, who had won the pair's only previous meeting on clay in Parma, Italy in 2021."And today, it had everything."

McLaren ‘in a good place' after Friday practice – Piastri

‘We're not as fast as we look,' insists Hadjar after taking P2 in second practice

Oscar Piastri set the pace during a disrupted second practice hour on Friday in Singapore, but can McLaren lead the way throughout the weekend or is one of their rivals looking likely to pose a challenge?

It wasn't the smoothest of days for Formula 1's 10 teams in Singapore as a disrupted second practice – which is the only practice session to take place at night and thus the only representative running drivers will get before Qualifying – meant very few long runs were completed, while multiple drivers had to abort their soft-tyre runs because of stoppages or yellow flags. That makes it's very tricky to work out a pecking order - but there are a few trends that emerged....

Championship leader Oscar Piastri wasted no time putting his frustrating weekend in Baku behind him (he suffered his first DNF of the year with crashes in both Qualifying and the race) to go top of the pile – and it looks like his McLaren is the one to beat as they search for 13 points this weekend to wrap up the Teams' Championship.

McLaren ‘in a good place' after Friday practice – Piastri

‘We're not as fast as we look,' insists Hadjar after taking P2 in second practice

It was an early bath for George Russell on the first day of Singapore Grand Prix practice after the Mercedes man crashed into the barriers.

George Russell has apologised to Mercedes after crashing out of second practice for the Singapore Grand Prix, having lost some track time and left his mechanics with more work to do overnight.

Russell visited the Turn 16 barriers around a third of the way into Friday's FP2 session at the Marina Bay Street Circuit, ripping off his front wing and triggering the red flags to allow marshals to clear the track.

While most other drivers ended the night-time running with some 20 laps under their belts, Russell could take no further part and was limited to just six tours, putting him on the back foot for Saturday's action.

“It was a bit of a weird one, to be honest,” Russell said of the incident afterwards. “I'm not too sure what happened. I braked a bit earlier, went in a little bit slower, then just lost the rear.

“Thankfully I sort of went in front-end on and didn't do too much damage. Obviously game over, so it's a bit annoying. I'm sorry to the team for that, but better today than tomorrow.”

As for how the rest of his day unfolded, the Briton reflected: “FP1 was challenging. In those early laps [of FP2] I had a much better feel with the car, to be honest. The pace seemed better.

“We didn't complete any [proper] laps, so there was no sort of real lap time on the board, but at least the laps, if you took the sectors together, felt better.

“As I said, it's not been our best Friday by a long way. At Singapore, the track's always evolving, there's a bit of rain in the air, so I'm not too concerned.”

On the other side of the Mercedes garage, Kimi Antonelli completed the session – via another red flag caused by Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson crashing out – but wound up only 18th, having experienced a compromised run on the soft tyres.

“To be honest, to me it didn't look as bad,” he said, when asked about what appeared to be a particularly tough day. “The result definitely didn't show what we could have achieved.

“On the soft I had to abort the lap, but we were on for a pretty good lap. To be honest, I felt pretty good in the car. We're trying to find the best set-up. There's still quite a little bit to improve, but as well with my driving I'm trying to evolve lap by lap.

“Hopefully tomorrow I can improve myself, hopefully we can improve the car a little bit as well, and then we can put on a fight.”

McLaren ‘in a good place' after Friday practice – Piastri

‘We're not as fast as we look,' insists Hadjar after taking P2 in second practice

Typically high temperatures and humidity levels are expected at the Singapore Grand Prix, leading to a ‘heat hazard' being declared.

A ‘heat hazard' has been declared by Formula 1's governing body, the FIA, for this weekend's Singapore Grand Prix. But what does it mean for the teams and the drivers at the Marina Bay Street Circuit? F1.com explains all…

For some background, following the particularly high temperatures and humidity experienced over the 2023 Qatar Grand Prix weekend, the FIA began an analysis into how similar situations could be managed in the future.

Ahead of the 2025 season getting under way, it was confirmed that a ‘heat hazard' can be declared if pre-weekend weather forecasts predict temperatures of 31 Celcius or above at some point during a Sprint or Grand Prix.

Teams are notified of the declaration by the FIA, as they have been in Singapore, and subsequently need to fit a ‘Driver Cooling System'.

Singapore has made a name for itself as one of the toughest races on the calendar, both physically and mentally, with the demands of driving an F1 car around city streets added to by high temperatures and humidity levels.

All three days of action at the Marina Bay Street Circuit are set to feature air temperatures above 30 Celsius, as well as high humidity, even with Free Practice 2, Qualifying and the Grand Prix taking place well into the evening.

In short, this is defined as a system with the “sole purpose” of providing additional cooling for drivers under a ‘Heat Hazard' scenario.

Several components are involved, including a pump, plumbing and thermal store, with cold fluid generated by the system delivered to the drivers through a special fireproof vest featuring various tubes.

All of the core system components must be fitted to cars this weekend, though drivers are currently permitted to choose whether or not they wear the vest itself as work continues on fine-tuning the design.

Given this extra, mandated equipment, an increase to the standard 800kg minimum car weight limit will come into play, with two different numbers applied: an additional 2kg for practice, Qualifying and Sprint Qualifying sessions, and +5kg for a Sprint or Grand Prix.

The two different limit increases essentially mean that teams can fit the system and its core components without needing to fill it with fluid in Free Practice and Qualifying, given the shorter run nature of these sessions.

“Any driver may elect not to wear any items of personal equipment that form part of the Driver Cooling System,” reads Article 26.19 of the FIA F1 Sporting Regulations. “In such circumstance, all other components, including any cooling medium, of the Driver Cooling System must be fitted.

“In addition, the difference in mass between the driver's personal equipment normally used and any items of a driver's personal equipment that form part of the system must be compensated by the fitting of 0.5kg of ballast in the cockpit.”

Mercedes' George Russell, who is also a Director of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association, has already trialled the system – including at the Bahrain Grand Prix, where air temperatures hit 30 Celsius and track temperatures approached 50 degrees.

“We've used the driver cooling vest a few times already this season at hot races, but obviously this is the first time where [the Driver Cooling System] has become mandatory, which is good news,” said Russell.

“When you're racing in 90% humidity and the cockpit [temperatures] are getting on for 60 degrees, it's a bit of a sauna inside the car, so I think we all welcome it.”

Attention now turns to Friday's first practice session in Singapore, where all 20 drivers will get the opportunity to sample the system.

McLaren ‘in a good place' after Friday practice – Piastri

‘We're not as fast as we look,' insists Hadjar after taking P2 in second practice

Fernando Alonso put Aston Martin at the top of the timesheets as the Singapore Grand Prix weekend got under way.

Aston Martin driver Fernando Alonso was a somewhat surprising pace-setter during Friday's first practice session for the Singapore Grand Prix, leading the way from Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and the Red Bull of Max Verstappen.

Alonso worked his way down to a best time of 1m 31.116s over the course of the one-hour session, which began at 1730 local time under cloudy skies – fresh from some afternoon showers – in typically hot and humid conditions.

Those high temperatures led to a pre-weekend ‘heat hazard' declaration from F1's governing body, the FIA, introduced following the conditions experienced at the 2023 Qatar Grand Prix, meaning a special ‘Driver Cooling System' has been fitted to cars this weekend.

All 20 cars were quick to make an appearance when the green light switched on at the end of the pit lane, with most drivers opting for hard tyres – and the Aston Martins taking mediums – despite a few damp patches lingering.

There was some early drama for Alex Albon when the Thai-British driver returned to the pits with some smoke coming from the rear of his Williams, forcing mechanics to get the air blowers and fire extinguishers out to keep the situation under control.

Practice 1 results

FORMULA 1 SINGAPORE AIRLINES SINGAPORE GRAND PRIX 2025

While that unfolded, the remaining 19 drivers got laps on the board and tried to find a rhythm around the Marina Bay Street Circuit – Lando Norris going fastest (1m 33.388s) via a wobble through Turn 17 and Leclerc surviving a lock-up at Turn 13.

Just over a quarter of the way into the session, it was Alonso who held P1 on a 1m 32.592s with his medium tyres, followed by Max Verstappen, Leclerc, the McLarens of Oscar Piastri and Norris, and Williams' Carlos Sainz (all on the hard rubber).

Bad news followed for Albon, with Williams confirming that his car had experienced a rear brake hardware problem, ruling him out for the remainder of the session – although the team are “confident” of it being resolved ahead of second practice.

Further moments followed when drivers began to push that little bit harder, bringing a trip to the run-off for Alpine's Pierre Gasly when he went too deep at Turn 14, and a close call with the wall for Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton exiting the same corner.

As the session moved past its halfway point, Alonso lowered the benchmark to a 1m 32.054s before Sainz took over on a 1m 31.812s, meaning times were already on the edge of those seen in FP1 last year, when Leclerc set the pace with a 1m 31.763s.

Attention then turned to drivers' soft-shod running, with the first runs on Pirelli's red-marked compound triggering another flurry of green and purple sector times – Leclerc going quickest on a 1m 31.266s from Verstappen, Norris and Racing Bulls rookie Isack Hadjar.

“That felt very understeery,” reported Piastri, meanwhile, after initially lapping more than half a second slower than team mate Norris – the Australian looking to bounce back from a difficult Azerbaijan weekend that saw his championship lead cut to 25 points.

As the final minutes ticked by and more Qualifying-style simulations came in, Alonso followed up his early pace by clocking an eye-catching 1m 31.116s and returning to the top of the timesheets over Leclerc, Verstappen and Hamilton – a lap that would not be beaten before the chequered flag.

Despite some traffic and a brush with the wall, Piastri improved significantly to edge out Norris for fifth, followed by Hadjar, Sainz, the second Red Bull of Yuki Tsunoda and Haas racer Esteban Ocon, who rounded out the top-10 positions.

Mercedes had a quiet start to the weekend as George Russell and Kimi Antonelli wound up 11th and 14th respectively, split by Nico Hulkenberg and Gasly, while Liam Lawson, Ollie Bearman, Gabriel Bortoleto, Lance Stroll, Franco Colapinto and the sidelined Albon brought up the rear.

Drivers and teams will now regroup in the Marina Bay paddock to dig through the data ahead of Free Practice 2, which is set to begin at 2100 local time and take place in conditions more representative of Qualifying and the Grand Prix.

McLaren ‘in a good place' after Friday practice – Piastri

‘We're not as fast as we look,' insists Hadjar after taking P2 in second practice

Check out all of the odds for this weekend's Singapore Grand Prix, from the pole position favourite to who might claim victory.

Formula 1 heads to the Marina Bay Street Circuit as the Singapore Grand Prix hosts Round 18 of the championship, but what do the odds tell us about who might succeed during the weekend ahead? Read on to find out...

Odds are provided by F1's Official Betting Data Supplier ALT Sports Data, are subject to change and are presented in decimal form: for every $1 wagered you would win the figure represented by the odds; so, if Verstappen is favourite at 1.50, you would win $1.50 for every dollar bet.

We have to rewind to June 2024 to find the last time Max Verstappen won two Grands Prix in a row prior to his recent back-to-back run at Monza and Baku. Despite his return to the winner's circle, Verstappen has had to battle in previous editions of the Singapore Grand Prix, never claiming top honours.

Last year's winner Lando Norris enters the weekend with five triumphs to his name this year, but the Briton failed to capitalise on team mate Oscar Piastri's DNF in Baku, leaving valuable championship points on the table.

The Australian still boasts the highest win count this campaign with seven, and averages 2.38 across all completed races.

Double Singapore podium finisher Charles Leclerc is tipped as having a decent chance of adding to this tally during the weekend ahead. Another option is George Russell, who is fresh off his seventh rostrum of the year but has never previously reached the top three at the Marina Bay Street Circuit.

Kimi Antonelli produced his best performance in Azerbaijan since his maiden top-three back in June by taking P4, while Carlos Sainz exhibited his class in the last round, collecting his first podium for Williams.

The Spaniard will be hoping for another strong result as he lines up on the circuit where he triumphed from lights to flag in 2023.

The second part of the ‘Carbono' pairing, Alex Albon, leads the midfield this season in top-six results, registering five. He last crossed the line inside that threshold at Zandvoort, before finishing seventh a week later at Monza.

Isack Hadjar only has two top-sixes in the vault this campaign, but they've both come on tracks demanding a higher downforce set-up. He thrived in the Netherlands a month ago, clinching his first F1 rostrum, and backed it up with consecutive 10th places in Italy and Azerbaijan.

Liam Lawson stands out as a value-for-money pick, coming off his second top-six return in seven starts. The Kiwi has really settled into his role at Racing Bulls, and qualified third fastest in Baku before finishing fifth.

Over at the senior team, Yuki Tsunoda stepped up to drive his finest race in an RB21. He ended sixth in the previous round to give his team their highest points tally in a single Grand Prix this season. While he deserves the praise, Singapore is a different animal that has rarely suited the Milton-Keynes outfit. Meanwhile, three-time event victor Lewis Hamilton carries shorter odds for a top-six after collecting eight in 17 rounds.

Double World Champion Fernando Alonso touches down in Southeast Asia with six top-10s to his name. His best drive of the year came at another track demanding a high downforce set-up, the Hungaroring, where the veteran crossed the line in fifth to triumph in the midfield battle.

Esteban Ocon is another competitor with six top-10 results behind him. While he did fare well in Monaco, finishing seventh, he's struggled in recent rounds, grabbing only one top-10 in the previous five outings.

Lance Stroll lines up on the streets of Marina Bay after finishing inside the first 10 positions on five occasions in 2025 while, over at Kick Sauber, Gabriel Bortoleto arrives into the weekend averaging 9.80 since F1's visit to Belgium.

Verstappen leads the Pirelli Pole Position award with six fastest Qualifying laps in 17 rounds. The Dutchman has bagged the last two front row places on the trot, while Drivers' Championship leader Piastri sits in second with five starts from the first bay on the grid.

The Australian's team mate, Norris, is the favourite to go fastest on Saturday. The Briton did it on these streets a year ago and also took pole in Monaco earlier in the year, a track with similar downforce demands.

Leclerc presents attractive odds to qualify quickest, having twice claimed pole position in previous editions of the Singapore Grand Prix. Besides his past endeavours, the Monegasque took top spot on the Saturday in Hungary back at the start of August.

McLaren enter Round 18 looking to wrap up the Teams' Championship with six weekends remaining on the calendar after Singapore. They only require 13 points to put the title beyond their peers, but the papaya outfit will clearly be seeking a repeat of Norris' 2024 race win regardless.

Mercedes and Ferrari are still technically in the running for the overall title. However, they need to outscore the Woking team by 31 and 35 points respectively.

The Silver Arrows will be hoping for a good result after a second and fourth-place return in Baku, while Ferrari have taken top honours in Marina Bay three times in the past 10 editions.

Up until now, ABC's Scrubs revival has been almost entirely nostalgia-facing in how it's been presented to the world: Series creator Bill Lawrence knows fans will be tuning in, to a pretty heavy degree, to check back in on the old Sacred Heart gang, and so all the early promotion for the show—including a cast photo released after the show's first table read last week—has focused on returning stars Zach Braff, Donald Faison, Sarah Chalke, Judy Reyes, and John C. McGinley. But Lawrence has also talked about the show having a healthy component focused on younger and newer characters, and now a big dump of casting info has arrived to confirm that there will be plenty of new folks around to struggle with modern medicine. (And also The Todd and Hooch, natch.)

This is per Variety, reporting on the new intern class that the show (which is being showrun by original series alums Tim Hobert and Aseem Batra) will feature in its revival season: Ava Bunn, Jacob Dudman, David Gridley, Layla Mohammadi, and Amanda Morrow, all of whom are relative newcomers, and will be billed as recurring guest stars. In addition to those less established roles, the show has also tapped a couple of better-known comedy names to pop in from time to time, with Vanessa Bayer and Joel Kim Booster both tapped to appear. (Bayer's playing a wellness program coordinator, while Booster will be playing another doctor working at Sacred Heart.)

All that, along with confirmation that Robert Maschio, who appeared in roughly two-thirds of the episodes of the show's original run, will be reprising his role as Todd “The Todd” Quinlan. He'll be joined by Phill Lewis, who made far fewer, but still pretty memorable, appearances on the series as Hooch, who's crazy. All of which has us asking: No Neil Flynn? The former Janitor is still part of the Bill Lawrence Industrial Complex, after all, having popped up on Shrinking and in the Clone High revival. The death of Sam Lloyd in 2020 means no true reunion of the Brain Trust is possible, but c'mon: You have to get Dr. Ján Ïtor in here somewhere, right?

Rachel Reilly isn't done with reality TV just yet. Fresh off her “Big Brother” 27 exit, the “Big Brother” legend revealed she's officially working on a “Survivor” audition tape. If she were to be cast, she would become the first contestant ever to complete CBS's “Reality Trifecta” of “Big Brother,” “The Amazing Race,” and “Survivor.”

A post shared by CBS Big Brother (@bigbrothercbs)

The “Big Brother” 13 winner went to her Instagram Stories recently to let her followers know that she's currently working on her “Survivor” application, according to Parade. Reilly most recently appeared on “Big Brother” 27, which had its season finale on Sunday, September 28.

Reilly reshared a video of “Survivor” host Jeff Probst to her Instagram Story. In the video, Probst is encouraging Reilly to apply to the show while he is being interviewed on the Emmys red carpet.

Reilly then tagged a “Survivor” casting director in her post and wrote, “Working on that [audition] tape this week!”

Love her or hate her, Reilly knows what it takes to get on these shows. She has a lengthy reality television career with CBS. She also works as a casting agent for various unscripted shows.

While nothing is guaranteed, if Reilly were given a spot on an upcoming season of “Survivor,” she would become the first person to complete the CBS “Reality Trifecta.”

Reilly has competed on three seasons of “Big Brother” and three seasons on “The Amazing Race.” What's left to do? Compete on “Survivor,” of course.

Probst was being interviewed by Entertainment Tonight on the Emmy Awards red carpet back on Sunday, September 14. During that interview, Probst was told that Reilly was interested in competing on his show and becoming the first person to complete the trifecta.

“Well, first she's got to apply,” Probst said. “I mean, come on, she's got to want it bad enough to send in a little two-minute video and say, ‘Here's why I should be on.'”

The longtime “Survivor” host added, “There's no secret passageway to getting on Survivor. I think she's got a shot.”

This recent push for Reilly to compete on “Survivor” came after she was shockingly eliminated on “Big Brother” in September due to the “White Locust” twist.

Fans and former houseguests thought this new twist was unfair. It sent the “Big Brother” legend home without facing an eviction vote.

Regardless, she became the first member of the “Big Brother” 27 jury. Ultimately, she voted for her ally, Ashley Hollis, to win the game.

What do you think of Rachel Reilly competing on an upcoming season of “Survivor”?

The highly anticipated album takes the spot from Playboi Carti's Music.


													By
												

	Anna Chan



UPDATE: And another one! On Friday evening (Oct. 3), Spotify announced that Taylor Swift has another new streaming record under her belt. “The Life of a Record-Breaker,” a Spotify Instagram caption reads. “On October 3rd, 2025, Taylor Swift's ‘The Fate of Ophelia' became the most-streamed song in a single day in Spotify history.











A post shared by Spotify (@spotify)


PREVIOUSLY: The news is sweet like “Honey.” Just hours after Taylor Swift released her 12th studio album, The Life of a Showgirl, on Friday (Oct. 3), the highly anticipated set is already kicking down records.


	Spotify announced about 11 hours after the album's release that it has already broken the record for most streamed album in a single day so far in 2025. The record was most recently held by Playboi Carti's Music, which nabbed the honor upon its March 14 release.


	It's no surprise one record has already fallen. As Good Morning America reported from Spotify's Life of a Showgirl pop-up experience in New York City Friday morning, there were 1.2 million users on the platform who were streaming the new album exactly at that moment.


	Shortly after the release of The Life of a Showgirl, Swift shared a message with her fans about her latest album. “I can't tell you how proud I am to share this with you, an album that just feels so right,” she wrote in part in an Instagram post. “If you thought the big show was wild, perhaps you should come and take a look behind the curtain…”

	











	The pop superstar first announced the 12-track project on now-fiancé Travis Kelce and brother Jason Kelce's podcast, New Heights, in August. Swift has also said that the album, which is filled with what she described as “bangers,” was worked on in Sweden with producers Max Martin and Shellback during her career-spanning, record-breaking Eras Tour, which became the highest grossing tour of all time when it wrapped in December.

It's possible that no TV show, in the history of the medium, has been more on the cutting edge of calling its own fans nerds than The Simpsons. Powered by a creative team that was embracing the “too-online writer” stereotype back when that meant, like, Usenet, the long-running animated series started pegging too-picky fans early and often, doing foundational work in the “Chill out, Poindexter” sciences. We're happy to report that the show's modern creators have not dropped the ball in this regard, either, as series showrunner Matt Selman recently addressed one of the show's most obvious points of fan nit-picking—a sliding timescale that now means Homer and Marge Simpson are, in many cases, younger than fans who grew up watching the series when it first started airing—with a fresh and resounding cry of ” None of it happened! It's just a silly little show!”

Selman was talking to Entertainment Weekly, and specifically about last week's season 37 premiere, “Thrifty Ways To Thieve Your Mother.” (Because what young and hip millennials don't love a 50-year-old Paul Simon pun?) The episode shows the young Marge Bouvier as a teen in the distant past of the 1990s, falling in love with an obvious Dawson's Creek parody called Keagan's Pond—despite the fact that the show has previously depicted Marge and Homer as teenagers in both the 1970s and the 1980s. We mean, what are we, to believe this is some sort of magic sliding timescale?

Yeah, basically: “It's a fucking paradox,” Selman says in the EW interview, laying out the obvious practicalities that fans basically have to accept by now. “The options are: we don't do flashback shows ever and we don't mention the past ever, which creatively handcuffs us, or we are playful and silly, which is the DNA of the show, and we have fun with whatever generation the show is airing in.” Adding that his creative process on the matter is “I don't give an eff,” Selman—who's been with the series since the Dawson's Creek days himself, and has been co-showrunner, with Al Jean, since 2011—asserts that keeping the show locked to its original depiction of Homer and Marge's childhoods “would be much worse for telling good stories.”

You can't ignore childhood if you're going to be a storyteller. So we're not ignoring childhood. It would've been interesting as an experiment to just lock into the '70s and have them be like, ‘Well, Lisa, when I was a kid in the '70s…' and then just have it all be about the '70s, even though we live in the fucking post-apocalyptic future now.

Selman, who seems mostly amused by the whole phenomenon, invites fans to drive themselves crazy in whichever ways they like: “If it brings you pleasure as a fan to pick apart the timeline of a 40-year-old show where the characters do not age, please pick it away. Pick, pick, pick. Have fun, pick at it, go crazy, pick it away…I would also like to point out that in no way are we saying that the beloved other flashbacks didn't happen. We're not saying that. None of it happened! It's just a silly little show! So I like it all. Everything happened and didn't happen with the same level of historical veracity.”

In advance of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, HGTV fan favorite Hilary Farr offered an emotional message via social media on September 29, 2025, urging her fans to get screened. 

The famed designer, who announced her departure from “Love It or List It” in December 2023 after starring in 258 episodes of the show, began her latest video on Instagram by saying, “Hi, I'm Hilary Farr and I am a breast cancer survivor.” 

Though Farr, 74, first opened up about her cancer battle in 2021, revealing details of her journey to People, many of the fans who flooded her post with comments said they did not know about her diagnosis or lingering side effects. Others thanked her for speaking out and for being a model of resilience and hope. 

A post shared by Hilary Farr (@hilary_farr)

In her video, Farr said she had partnered with the American Cancer Society (ACS) to help spread awareness as a breast cancer survivor. The ACS is commemorating the 40th anniversary of Breast Cancer Awareness Month by spending the first week of October specifically educating women about the importance of early screening and routine mammograms, per press materials. 

“You're going to see an awful lot of people in pink shirts and with pink pins showing their awareness and their support,” Farr told her followers. “And I think it is absolutely wonderful. But I think it's time to do a little bit more, if we can.” 

Urging everyone to take part in spreading the word, Farr said, “I think it's going to be different for everyone, but I would say it's time to share our stories. Let's get this out in the open and support our communities and, most importantly, get screened.” 

“Now here's a statistic that I really think you should know,” Farr said. “One in eight women in the U.S. are going to be diagnosed with breast cancer at some point in their lives. That means that all of us are going to know someone we love and we care deeply about who is going to have to fight this disease.”

“And fight they will,” Farr continued, “and the research that is being done is going to help us every inch of the way. But for now, take a deep breath. Sit with your friends and just talk about it and think of what you can do to raise awareness and action this October.” 

According to ACS's Cancer Facts & Figures 2025 report, in addition to one in eight women in the U.S.  diagnosed with 1 in 8 women with invasive breast cancer during their lifetime, one in 43 will die from the disease. 

Screening was a key factor in Farr's battle with breast cancer, she told People in 2021. She informed the outlet that in 2012, doctors found a suspicious lump in one of her breasts during a routine mammogram. Farr immediately had surgery to remove the lump, called a lumpectomy, and tests showed the tumor was precancerous, not malignant. 

“I felt so much relief,” she recalled to People. “I moved on.”

But in late 2014, while filming “Love It or List It” in Raleigh, North Carolina, another mammogram revealed a new tumor that had spread into surrounding breast tissue, Farr told People. She was diagnosed with invasive breast cancer and underwent a second lumpectomy surgery. 

Farr told the outlet that her medical oncologist said they got all of the cancer, but erroneously said she didn't need any further treatment. However, two months later, Farr learned she needed radiation to destroy any remaining cancer cells and reduce the risk of recurrence. She told People she was “terrified” they did not catch it all in time. 

“I felt absolute fury that someone could be so flippantly wrong,” she said, noting that she filed a complaint and the oncologist retired the following year. “I could have been dead.” 

Farr underwent 28 rounds of radiation in March 2015, but another lump was found seven months later. The designer had a third lumpectomy, and like the first, that tumor was deemed to be precancerous. 

Farr has been in remission since her third lumpectomy, but revealed to one of the fans who commented on her September 29 post that she still deals with the side effects of treatment. 

The fan, who said she was a fellow breast cancer, wrote, “I developed lymphedema in my right arm nearly 2 years after a lumpectomy and node removal. Do you have it too? Hope not.” 

Farr replied, “Yes- Lymphodema . Also side effects from radiation … But We're Still Here!”

Some cancer survivors suffer from lymphedema, caused by the buildup of lymph fluid between the skin and muscle, per the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The body's lymph system helps to fight off infection and disease, but cancer or cancer treatment can disrupt the flow and cause extremities to swell dramatically. For breast cancer patients, per the NCI, lymphedema tends to develop in the hands, arms or chest due to lymph nodes being removed or damaged during treatment. 

Many of Farr's followers shared their breast cancer stories in the comment section of her post, and others praised her for speaking up about the importance of early detection, including one who wrote, “What a wonderful way to celebrate and recognize and help those going through what you've experienced first hand👏 and you look beautiful.”

Since Farr left “Love It or List It,” a new version launched in 2025 featuring her former co-star, David Vistentin, paired with longtime HGTV personality Paige Turner. The new duo has begun filming their second season together in Toronto.

	The No. 1 exhibitor in the world's theatrical release of Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl, is heading toward a $15M-$16M Friday with a current opening-weekend forecast of $29M-$31M at 3,700 theaters. Note these figures do not come from AMC Theatres


	There are some estimates out there as high as $40M, but here is what's vital to keep in mind: This is very front-loaded with advance tickets sales arguably accounted for (true, we heard that last time with Dragon Ball: Infinity Castle, but that found an audience). The notion here is that all Swifties are making a date to see Showgirl today, because it's the release date of her album The Life of a Showgirl (duh).

	Although not any kind of October opening record, the marvel of it all is how the 14x Grammy winner was able to announce a cinematic experience two weeks before its release; steal Premium Large Format screens from Dwayne Johnson's The Smashing Machine, Leonardo DiCaprio's One Battle After Another and James Cameron's re-release of Avatar: The Way of Water; and get to this box office threshold with very little P&A.


	Swift already has broken the Spotify record for most single-day streams; her pre-saves for Showgirl were north of 5 million. No word yet where album sales will land for Swift on Showgirl, but she's the only performer to have sold more than 1M albums a week seven times. Swift's bestselling album reportedly is 1989, which has sold 14M copies in the U.S. alone and going platinum abroad.

	It was the best of times, and it was the worst of times at the weekend box office — the latter going to Dwayne Johnson's arthouse biopic about UFC fighter Mark Kerr, The Smashing Machine, which unfortunately is in a sleeper hold and destined for $6M-$7M in third place at 3,345 locations (read Deadline's review here). The net $50M production was funded largely by foreign sales. Smashing Machine hit tracking three weeks ago with a $20M projection. But after Swift announced two weeks ago that she was pushing her way onto The Rock's weekend, forecasts plummeted. More on that later. No audience score yet on Rotten Tomatoes. Today is $2.7M for the Benny Safdie-directed movie. Swift stole Smashing Machine‘s Dolby Cinemas.

	











	In second, is Warner Bros.' second weekend of One Battle After Another (read our review here), still armed with its 70MM Imax locations, with an estimated $12.5M (-43%) after a second Friday of $3.6M. If all goes right, domestic hits $44.1M by Sunday and overseas shoots to $56M take after a second frame $17M haul for a $100.1M global running cume. Knock on wood.


	Universal's second weekend of Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie at 3,507 venues is collapsing with $4.7M in 4th, -66%. Not good for a kids movie. That will get the big-screen version of the DreamWorks Animation-Netflix show to $21.1M by Sunday. Today is $1.2M.

	Fifth belongs to New Line's The Conjuring: Last Rites at 2,753 with a fifth Friday of $1.1M and fifth frame of $3.8M, -44%, and running cume of $166.6M, again, the highest-grossing movie in the horror franchise.


	20th Century Studios via Disney's reissue of Avatar: The Way of Water at 2,140 sites is seeing a $3M outside the Top 5. Today, including previews, is just under $1M. Again, the movie will offer one of three sneak peeks of December's Avatar: Fire and Ash. The 2022 pic is playing in 3D, Imax, with some PLFs.

	There are moments across Taylor Swift's newly released album, The Life of a Showgirl, that revel in the theatrics of public spectacles and high drama, something she knows well. Her 12-album discography has no shortage of friends, foes, lovers, and skeptics playing key characters in her music, but her new song “Actually Romantic” introduces a new leading lady who fans can't stop speculating about.


	A lot of this is because most people think the track is about Charli XCX. The two artists have orbited each other for years, having even shared the stage together on Swift's Reputation tour. But their stars blazed different paths for them both, converging again only by a twist of fate. Charli fell in love with the 1975's George Daniel in 2022, then a year later, Swift had entered a highly public and controversial situationship with the 1975's Matty Healy. For the first time in a while, their pop world's fully collided.


	Charli seemed to have feelings about this on the Brat record “Sympathy Is a Knife,” and Taylor seems to have feelings about her feelings on “Actually Romantic.” Here's how we got here. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Taylor Swift tapped Camila Cabello and Charli XCX to join her as openers for her Reputation stadium tour in 2018, welcoming both singers onstage for a rendition of “Shake It Off” every night. Charli was with her for the entirety of the tour, even joining her in Australia and New Zealand at the end of the run.

	











	A year later, Charli made headlines for an interview where she spoke about opening for Swift. “I'm really grateful that [Taylor] asked me on that tour,” she told Pitchfork. “But as an artist, it kind of felt like I was getting up on stage and waving to 5-year-olds. I've done so much of it, and it really cemented my status as this underdog character, which I like now.”


	Charli later clarified that she felt the quote had been taken out of context, adding on Twitter at the time, “I'd been playing a [ton] of 18+ club shows and so to be on stage in front of all ages was new to me and made me approach my performances with a whole new kind of energy… I am extremely grateful for the opportunity I was given.”

	Taylor and Charli's paths crossed once again in 2023 — this time thanks to the 1975.


	At the time, Charli and her now-husband, George Daniel, the band's guitarist, had been together for at least a year after going Instagram official in 2022. Swift started dating the 1975 frontman Matty Healy after weeks of speculation in May 2023, although they only lasted a few months together.


	Healy seemed to become the subject of several songs on The Tortured Poets Department, including “Guilty as Sin?” She also seemed to address the criticism she faced for dating Healy on “I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can).” The pair reportedly broke up in June 2023.


	George and Charli's romance ended up in a different direction: The pair got engaged in late 2023, and tied the knot over the summer of 2025. “I wanna dance with george foreverrrr,” she captioned some of her wedding pictures.


	Charli XCX's unexpected Brat was sold as an album with fewer complexities than she set out to communicate across its track list. But as much as she was bumpin' that on “365,” she was also putting her biggest insecurities under a microscope on “Girl, So Confusing” (about how she and Lorde orbited each other before they worked it out on the remix) and “Sympathy is a Knife,” which many people thought revolved around Swift.

	In the first verse, she sets the stage: “This one girl taps my insecurities/Don't know if it's real or if I'm spiraling.” Later, she gets a little more direct, singing, “Don't wanna see her backstage at my boyfriend's show/Fingers crossed behind my back, I hope they break up quick.”Listeners were quick to make the connection to Swift and Healy. Charli tapped Ariana Grande for the remix, but that did little to quell rumors that Swift was deep under her skin. 

	











	While Charli hasn't directly addressed whether “Sympathy Is a Knife” references Swift, she did say in a since-deleted TikTok post that there are no “diss tracks” on Brat. She issued the clarification after lyrics to the album leaked, and also criticized the experience of being a “female artist, where you are pitted against your peers but also expected to be best friends with every single person constantly. If you're not, you're deemed a bad feminist.” 


	“I think it's really just only human to at some points in your life compare yourself to other people,” she said while explaining “Sympathy Is a Knife” during a Brat track-by-track. “I think there's a lot of shame around it, and there's a lot of worry that you're not a strong enough person, or you don't know yourself well enough, or that you're deeply insecure if you do it. Maybe you are, but that's fine. You can't be too tough on yourself, because the world is really vicious and really hard, and envy is a natural emotion for people. Sometimes you just have days where you feel small or anxious or that you're not good enough. I definitely have those days.”


	Charli XCX called out her fans after a June show in São Paulo, where videos surfaced of crowds chanting “Taylor is dead.” On Instagram Stories, she urged them to stop: “Can the people who do this please stop, online or at my shows. It is the opposite of what I want, and it disturbs me that anyone would think there is room for this in this community.”


	She added, “I will not tolerate it.”


	In an interview with Vulture, Charli went deeper into “Sympathy Is A Knife.” “That song is about me and my feelings and my anxiety and the way my brain creates narratives and stories in my head when I feel insecure and how I don't want to be in those situations physically when I feel self-doubt. Sometimes I'd look onstage and be like, Oh my God … I'm never going to play these rooms, ever. That made me feel jealous. I told Matty that. And George. They were both like, ‘Shut up. What are you talking about?'”


	In that same interview, Swift was quoted praising Charli. “Her writing is surreal and inventive, always. She just takes a song to places you wouldn't expect it to go, and she's been doing it consistently for over a decade,” Swift said.

	











	“I heard you call me ‘Boring Barbie' when the coke's got you brave/High-fived my ex and then you said you're glad he ghosted me,” Swift sings on the opening verse of the Showgirl track. Online, speculation quickly mounted, with people guessing it referenced Charli's “Everything Is Romantic” in its title. But “Sympathy Is A Knife” seemed to be the bigger issue: “Wrote me a song sayin' it makes you sick to see my face,” she continues in an apparent reference to the track. “Some people might be offended/But it's actually sweet/All the time you've spent on me.”

	Swift is rarely ambiguous. (How many artists sold vinyl records filled with white powder?) The line “How many times has your boyfriend said/‘Why are we always talkin' 'bout her?'” feels like a response to Charli singing, “George says I'm just paranoid/Says he just don't see it, he's so naive.” But other shots on the song feel rooted in private interactions. “You think I'm tacky, baby/Stop talking dirty to me/It sounded nasty, but it/Feels like you're flirting with me,” Swift sings. “I mind my business, God's my witness that I don't provoke it.” 


	In a track-by-track, Swift shed more light on the song, saying, “‘Actually Romantic' is a song about realizing that someone else has kind of had a one-sided adversarial relationship with you that you didn't know about and all of a sudden they start doing too much. They start letting you know that, actually, you've been living in their head rent-free and you had no idea — and it's presenting itself as them sort of resenting you or having a problem with you.” She goes on to say she accepts it as “attention and affection and how flattering that somebody has made you such a big part of their reality when you didn't even think about them.”

Sean “Diddy” Combs has been sentenced to 50 months in prison and pay a fine of $500,000, the maximum possible, after being found guilty of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. (That sentence adds up to just over four years, but the 14 months he has already served in prison will be deducted.) Today in Manhattan's Federal District Court, U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian outlined his reasoning behind the substantial length, citing the need “to send a message to abusers and victims alike that exploitation and violence against women is met with real accountability.”

“The Court has to consider all of your history here. A history of good works can't wash away the record in this case, which shows that you abused the power and control over the lives of women who you professed to love,” said Judge Subramanian. “The court is not assured that if released these crimes will not be committed again.”

“To Ms. Ventura and the other brave survivors that came forward, I want to say first: We heard you. I am proud of you for coming to the court to tell the world what really happened,” added Judge Subramanian after issuing the sentence. “Mr. Combs, you and your family are going to get through it… You will have a chance to show your children and the world what real accountability, change, and healing [can look like].”

Before the sentencing was determined, Diddy rose at the defense table to give a 12-minute statement, reports The New York Times. “One of the hardest things I've had to handle is having to be quiet, not being able to express how sorry I am for my actions,” said Diddy. He apologized to Cassie Ventura and her family “for any harm or hurt that I've caused her, emotionally or physically.” He also apologized to former girlfriend Jane, saying, “I brought you into my mess.” Diddy then apologized to all victims of domestic violence, his family, and his children, and referred to his conduct “disgusting, shameful, and sick.” “No matter what anybody says, I know that I'm truly sorry for it all,” he concluded.

Diddy's hearing opened with Judge Subramanian setting a sentencing guideline of 70 to 87 months—nearly six to just over seven years—which far exceeded the maximum of 14 months that Diddy's lawyers requested, and stated that the law allowed him to consider all relevant testimony and evidence from the trial in making his final decision. “Combs has challenged his factual guilt full-throatedly, and has even done so after trial,” said Judge Subramanian, according to CNN. He added that Diddy “has expressed remorse for some things,” but not for his actual convictions of transporting people to engage in prostitution.

Back on July 2, Diddy was found guilty of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, but cleared of racketeering and sex trafficking, after less than 48 hours of deliberation by the jury. He was denied bail. It ended a trial that began back in May, with the jury determining that Diddy was not guilty of three of the five charges, including racketeering, which carried the heaviest sentence. Each count of transportation to engage in prostitution carried a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. Diddy, who pleaded not guilty to all the charges, still faces numerous civil lawsuits accusing him of various sex crimes.

Before the sentencing decision was finalized today, both the prosecution and Diddy's legal team made their final statements to Judge Subramanian. “This is not just a case about freak-offs and hotel rooms,” U.S. prosecutor Christy Slavik said today before the judge, arguing for a more severe sentence. “[It's] about a man who did horrible things to other people. His currency was control. He weaponized it.” Slavik continued: “The defendant tries to argue this is just a sex, drugs, and rock ‘n' roll lifestyle. But this is a case about transportation for prostitution and violence. The defendant admitted to the violence at trial. The defendant's respect for the law is lip service.”

Slavik also claimed that Diddy is still acting with extreme arrogance in the wake of his charges because the rapper booked multiple speaking engagements in Miami “for next week,” implying Diddy expected a light sentence, reports The New York Times. “That is the height of hubris,” said Slavik. Giovanni Sairras—founder of Re-entry One, a nonprofit that helps incarcerated people re-enter society upon their release—elaborated on why his nonprofit booked Diddy as “an instructor teaching both virtually and in person” about entrepreneurship, mentorship, life skills, and more.

Diddy's lawyers, Marc Agnifilo, Jason Driscoll, Teny Geragos, Alexandra Shapiro, and Brian Steel, were present for the decision, as were the disgraced rapper and his family. Diddy's lawyers argued for a more lenient sentence of no more than 14 months in prison, including his time already served, by pointing to the sentences of similar cases. Diddy's lawyers also submitted numerous letters written by those who can speak to the hip-hop mogul's character—including a letter by Diddy himself, which Judge Subramanian criticized as “inappropriate” in tone—as well as a 12-minute video to play in court, which compiled various footage of Diddy hosting charity events, interacting with his children at home, and taking part in other moments meant to emphasize his generosity.

Casandra Elizabeth “Cassie” Ventura, Diddy's former girlfriend, set off a chain of litigation when she filed her bombshell lawsuit against Diddy in November 2023. Although she quickly settled the case, she spoke openly and graphically in testimony for this trial. This week, Cassie also submitted a letter to Judge Subramanian, in which she pleaded for a tougher sentencing. “I am so scared that if he walks free, his first actions will be swift retribution towards me and others who spoke up about his abuse at trial,” she wrote. The two counts on which Diddy was convicted relate to the transportation of Cassie and Jane Doe to engage in prostitution.

The federal indictment alleged that Diddy has run a criminal enterprise since at least 2008, under which he “abused, threatened, and coerced women and others around him to fulfill his sexual desires, protect his reputation, and conceal his conduct,” largely during marathon multi-partner sex sessions the rapper calls “freak-offs.” Diddy and his associates have been accused of drugging women and forcing them to have sex with male sex workers while filming them.

The prosecution, an all-women legal team led by Maurene Comey, questioned 34 witnesses during the trial, presenting photos, videos, pages of text messages and email transcripts, and financial records as evidence against Diddy. Among the central testimonies were those of Diddy's former girlfriends Cassie and a woman identified only as “Jane,” both of whom accused Diddy of forcing them to participate in “freak-offs.” During her four-day testimony, Cassie also accused Diddy of rape and physical abuse. Diddy declined to testify during the trial, and the defense presented no other witnesses.

Key testimony in the trial came from singer, songwriter, and former Diddy collaborator Dawn Richard. Richard alleged that, during that period, Diddy physically and verbally assaulted her during years spent working together on the reality show Making the Band and in the groups Danity Kane and Diddy - Dirty Money. (She brought the same allegations in a lawsuit filed last year.) During the trial, Richard also testified to witnessing Diddy physically abuse Cassie on numerous occasions, including an alleged 2009 incident during which she watched Diddy “beat [Cassie] on the ground in front of us.” Richard added, “I was scared that if I intervened, I might get [it] worse. I had never seen anything like that before.”

During the second week of the trial, rapper Kid Cudi took the witness stand. Cudi testified that his brief relationship with Cassie infuriated Diddy to the point that he arranged for a Molotov cocktail to be thrown into Cudi's car. Cudi claims that Diddy had his Porsche 911 convertible blown up as a form of retaliation for dating Cassie.

The prosecution also presented numerous former employees of Diddy, who claimed to have witnessed the rapper engaging in physical abuse and drug use; former escorts who testified about getting paid by Diddy for the alleged “freak-offs”; Cassie's mother, who recalled that Cassie informed her, in 2011, that Diddy was threatening to release sex tapes of her; and several others.

The defense focused on framing Diddy's alleged victims as willing participants. Diddy's attorneys depicted Jane as a consenting sex partner and showed text messages intended to present her as an enthusiastic participant in sex acts with Diddy and male escorts. The rapper's legal team also emphasized text messages between Cassie and Diddy during the lead-up to a 2016 “freak-off,” claiming that Cassie planned the event, and pointing out texts that suggested she consented to participation. Additionally, the defense presented drugs (or withdrawal from them) and jealousy as pretexts for Diddy's alleged violence.

It's opening day of Paul Thomas Anderson's “One Battle After Another,” and Alejandro González Iñárritu is worried about how it will play with audiences. “I just cross my fingers that people go in millions,” he told me. “I hope, because it's so important.”

We are talking on Zoom, and of course, Iñárritu is rooting for PTA: He's a fellow auteur who makes expensive original movies with movie stars. (BTW, the $130-million movie opened to $22 million.) For his part, Iñárritu just wrapped principal photography in April on an untitled comedy ensemble led by Tom Cruise and produced by Legendary for Warner Bros. 

 










The Mexican filmmaker is directing his first English-language movie since 2015's “The Revenant,” which won “One Battle After Another” star Leonardo DiCaprio his first Oscar. The untitled Cruise comedy, shot in 35-millimeter VistaVision by three-time Oscar-winner Emmanuel “Chivo” Lubezki, should come out sometime next fall. The director is in the editing room.

“We're going to finish in February, March,” he said. “We still have a long way [in] post-production.”

Even though both Iñárritu and Cruise are powerful, controlling perfectionists on a movie production, “it was the most amazing, unexpected, sweet, gentle relation that I have had on a set,” Iñárritu said. “His manners, his understanding, his passion, and his integrity, and the way he prepares. He loves the process. Filmmaking has been his life for 40 years. I have never seen somebody so devoted. I was happy to share with him that passion. And at the same time, we built an incredible relation of mutual trust. He will surprise the world. People will see a new kind of thing. It was blessed, and not only him, but all the cast: Riz Ahmed, Sandra Hüller, John Goodman, and Jesse Plemons. We had a blast. It was challenging, but it was wild comedy. And we laugh a lot. We have a wild time.”

But we are not Zooming to talk about Cruise. This May, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of “Amores Perros,”  Iñárritu's daring triptych debut feature, shot in Mexico City and introducing Gael García Bernal, the director screened the restored 4K version at Cannes to a packed house. The movie holds up: It's vivid, loud, assaultive, and violent, from the visceral dogfights (no animals were harmed) to the glam model (Goya Toledo) who is forever mutilated in a car crash. A brand-new 5.1 surround sound mix by Jon Taylor at NBCUniversal StudioPost enhances the intensity.

 










The director hesitated to watch the film at the Cannes Classics showing. He had undergone the painstaking Criterion restoration for the 20th anniversary in 2020 with cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, but had only watched the film in bits and pieces. 

“I hadn't seen the film complete in 25 years,” he said. “The film was shot in a bleach-bypass process, or silver retain, which is a very corrosive thing, because the silver stays in the negative. So we have to restore a lot of things. [I thought] what young man did that? And all the effort that it took for all of us who did the film, the amount of work, considering the little money we have, and so little time. What I can tell you is that I was impressed by the muscle. It hasn't become a flaccid film.”

“Amores Perros” played Cannes 25 years ago, but not in Competition, where it was roundly rejected before it went to the selection committee. Luckily, it was invited to Critics' Week, won the Grand Prix, and landed a North American release in 2001 from Lionsgate. The rest is history. It launched the careers of Iñárritu, 19-year-old García Bernal, and Prieto, among others. After the screening, a grateful and teary García Bernal said, “It's a film that we all were transformed, and even the way in Mexico we were perceived, the films were transformed.”

 










“Even when we were a very small independent film in a very small section that is not even official, it became the film that everybody wanted to see,” said Iñárritu. The film was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar; the writer, director, and producer went on to win Best Director for “Birdman” and “The Revenant,” and Original Screenplay and Best Picture (“Birdman”).

When they made “Amores Perros,” the filmmaker explained, the Mexican film industry was producing only five to seven local films a year from the same few directors, with a nationalistic flavor, subsidized by the government. Maybe one would wind up in theaters. “Every director that I knew at that time, they [had] just made one film,” he said. “And they were already 50 years old. A film was considered a one-time opportunity, and you better make sure that you put all you have to say there.”

Also based in Mexico City, novelist Guillermo Arriaga wrote the screenplay for “Amores Perros,” “an incredible, solid, complex script,” said Iñárritu. “Mexico City is a complex city with incredible ancient culture with visual traditions. It has the third most museums in the world. And we were middle-class, educated. So we can see and observe: low, high, wherever. We were having access to many things.”

 










The “Amores Perros” team had been working together making commercials and videos for seven years. They were already quite sophisticated. “We were all Chilango, so we knew exactly how that city smells and feels,” said Iñárritu. “There was a new government coming, that threw out the party dictatorship of 70 years. So there was hope and a feeling that we need[ed] to shake who we were, how we talk about ourselves, how we see ourselves. This film came into the right moment.”

Iñárritu has written an essay about making the film for Mack Books' just-published “Amores Perros” book, which also showcases unseen set photography, critical essays, and production documents. And “Sueño Perro: Alejandro G. Iñárritu's Celluloid Installation” is making the rounds, starting at Fondazione Prada in Milan and LagoAlgo in Mexico City, and then moving in February to LACMA in Los Angeles.

Back in 2020, “Amores Perros,” which runs two hours and 37 minutes, was edited down from 1 million feet of material. “That means 15,000 feet of film of 35 millimeters,” said Iñárritu, “so 985,000 feet were left out. I was experimenting with handheld and lenses, and Rodrigo and I were on fire.”

The director found out that his 1 million feet of dailies were in storage in Mexico's National Autonomous University archive. “I started exploring,” he said. “It was beautiful to see how, when I start seeing all [that] was left out, how many films were there within the film, and watching this material with a new gaze. When I was editing, I was watching with the function of finding the pieces of the puzzle to serve the narrative. But now I was seeing the flow and the beauty itself of the images, so without the dictatorship of the narrative, I start collecting. And that's the beginning of this installation. It's 35-millimeter projectors in a labyrinth of dark rooms, with these big guys projecting material like a magic lantern. It's very dreamy. People are touched by it because it's not an homage to the film. It's a resurrection. It's a reinvention itself, and it stays completely detached from the film.”

 










The essay reveals the context of the “Amores Perros” production, the director's aesthetic and philosophy of filmmaking, and how he creates cards for each sequence in a movie. “My obsession is the grammatical film language,” he said. “Those cards integrate everything that I should know when whatever challenge of the film comes — in crisis, in production, in depression. Those are my bricks that sustain some clarity during [filming], and it helped me out. It's an exercise that takes me days and months to get it all, but it's homework that goes deep for me to understand what I'm dealing with. What is the purpose of the scene? What is the purpose of that character, what does the other guy want, and what will be the conflict?”

Mubi will re-release the film this month in theaters all over Latin America, and make it available globally on its streaming platform on October 24. While the filmmaker never made any money on the film, which he invested in, he now owns about 75 percent. “Mubi is buying the rights for the next 10 years,” he said. “They're one of the few streamers that are supporting independent filmmakers. We are in the right hands.”

While the life of a filmmaker is peripatetic at best, Iñárritu and his wife, with their two children out of the nest, are trying to decide where to live. They've been residing in Los Angeles. “We are gypsies,” he said. “I did ‘Bardo' in Mexico. So I lived in Mexico City for one year and a half. Then I finished shooting the last film at Warner Bros. It's a difficult moment in the world, and that decision is important for us. Things have changed a lot, as you know.”

EXCLUSIVE: Emmy winner Jason Bateman will be making his third feature as a director with Universal‘s adaptation of John Grisham‘s The Partner. The Ozark star, EP and director will also executive produce The Partner under his Aggregate Films, with his partner Michael Costigan producing. 


	Deadline first told you about the project which Tom Holland is producing and is planning to headline. 


	Rideback secured rights to the 1997 novel and put Imitation Game Oscar-winning scribe Graham Moore on it and set the project up at Universal. Rights were previously in the hands of New Regency which made Grisham classics Time to Kill, The Client, and Runaway Jury. Jonathan Eirich will produce the feature and Nick Reynolds will executive produce for Rideback.

	When Holland's deal is final, he'll play Patrick Lanigan, a young partner in a white shoe Biloxi law firm who fakes his own death in a burning car. He leaves behind a wife, newborn daughter, and a secret. What he's actually done is fake his death to create a template for a new life by stealing $90 million from a client of his crooked law firm. He finds happiness and love in South America. When the client who worked so hard to defraud the government finds the money is missing from his offshore accounts, he becomes determined to hunt down the lawyer he doesn't believe is dead. That leads the attorney to have to turn himself in to the FBI and face up to the wife, child and life he left behind.

I disagree completely. Holland is not way too young and not very wrong to play this role He's perfect for this 100%

Bateman is a great choice to direct but also to co-star as the client.

Batemans a great choice for this material – but Holland is very wrong and way too young.

Practice makes perfect and Retta is here to prove it. The comedic actress and HGTV star is among the famous contestants competing on a new season of “Celebrity Wheel of Fortune,” with her episode premiering on October 3, 2025. 

The “Ugliest House in America” host competes on the iconic game show against New Kids on the Block member Joey McIntyre and actor Oliver Hudson (also known for being Goldie Hawn's son and Kate Hudson's brother). In preview clips from the episode, she tells host Ryan Seacrest that she watched lots of “Wheel of Fortune” in preparation, trying to solve each puzzle for practice. Did it help? 

A post shared by Celebrity Wheel of Fortune (@celebritywheeloffortune)

In a preview from Retta's episode released by ABC, it's clear that she's in the midst of doing pretty well on the show — even though she's feeling uneasy about it. 

Seacrest is seen telling her, “So, I don't understand. You keep saying you're feeling sick about this, but you're solving all the puzzles.” 

“I'm not solving all the puzzles,” Retta quips, and Seacrest counters, “Well, you're solving a lot of the puzzles. You were doing major show prep for this, right? Watching some episodes?”

The “Parks & Recreation” alum admits, “I was. Yeah, I watched this week. I watched like this.” 

Retta then crouches down behind the famous wheel, and widens her eyes, looking like she's in game mode, studying the contestants' every move. 

“I was very (serious) getting ready,” she sighs, before Seacrest asks if there were “any takeaways” from her studying. Retta cracks, “That I'm not that good!” 

“But you are,” Seacrest exclaims, and then Hudson asks, “If you're not that good, what am I?” 

Laughing, she quips, “You're the worst!” 

On “Celebrity Wheel of Fortune,” now in its sixth season, stars can win up to $1 million for their favorite charities. 

In the fall of 2024, Seacrest took over hosting duties from longtime host Pat Sajak on the daily version of “Wheel of Fortune,” with co-host Vanna White by his side. Sajak remained on “Celebrity Wheel of Fortune” for one last season, though, so this is Seacrest's first time hosting the primetime version. 

So far, so good. The season six premiere — featuring “Dancing With The Stars” cast members Jenna Johnson, Derek Hough, and Bruno Tonioli — scored the primetime game show its biggest ratings in two years, according to ABC. 

Retta's hourlong episode of “Celebrity Wheel of Fortune” premieres on October 3 on ABC at 8 p.m. Eastern time. After that, the latest episode of her series “Scariest House in America” airs on HGTV at 9 p.m. Eastern time.

'Final Destination: Bloodlines' co-writer Lori Evans Taylor is penning the new installment.


							By 

	Borys Kit


Senior Film Writer


	The next installment of Final Destination has found its death dealer. Belgian filmmaker Michiel Blanchart is the choice to direct New Line's follow-up to Final Destination: Bloodlines. Sources say there is no offer just yet, but Blanchart, who will be making his English-language debut with the feature, bubbled to the top this week after a brief but intense search. Hollywood has been waiting to see who would direct the next installment after Bloodlines opened No. 1 globally, achieving the best opening weekend in the six-film series to become the highest-grossing entry in the 25-year-old Final Destination franchise. Released in May, the movie grossed over $314.6 million at the worldwide box office, $138.1 million of that domestically. (And it has yet to open in Japan.) Zach Lipovsky and Adam Stein directed the film but opted not to return.  Lori Evans Taylor, who wrote Bloodlines along with Gary Busick, is penning the new script. Destination franchise producer and steward Craig Perry and franchise veteran Sheila Hanahan Taylor are back producing, as are Jon Watts and his wife, Dianne McGunigle, along with Toby Emmerich. Warren Zide is exec producing. Destination was a surprise hit franchise for New Line in the early 2000s, with a concept that proved easy to transfer from movie to movie, locale to locale, victim to unwitting victim. Each movie centered on a character who has a premonition of a horrific and deadly event. They cheat his or her own death and save several other lives in the process, only to have Death, personified as an unstoppable force of nature, come for the survivors one by one.

	The Final Destination franchise has earned over $1 billion worldwide, making it New Line's third-biggest horror franchise behind the over $2.73 billion grossed by the Conjuring Universe and the $1.2 billion generated by the It films.  Despite only one feature credit to his name, Blanchart is no neophyte. His short You're Dead, Hélène (T'es morte, Hélène) was shortlisted in the best live-action short film category at the 2023 Oscars. It told of a man trying to break up with his girlfriend, who happens to be a ghost and not at all happy to be dumped. It's now set up for an English-language adaptation at Tri-Star with Sam Raimi producing. Blanchart made his feature debut with Night Call (Le nuit se traine), a 2024 action crime thriller that gained strong notices not only for its Collateral-like genre thriller but also encompassing timely social commentary. The movie swept the Belgian version of the Academy Awards, the Magritte Awards, earlier this year, winning 10 out of 11 nominations. Blanchart walked away with best film, best first feature film, best screenplay and best director statues. He is repped by WME and Ithaka Media.

	In the wake of Final Destination: Bloodlines becoming the highest grossing chapter in the 25-year-old franchise with $315M worldwide, New Line is keeping it going, and they're looking to Belgian filmmaker Michiel Blanchart to take the helm.


	The WME-repped Blanchart broke out with his short film, You're Dead Helene, which won top prizes at the Brussels International Film Festival and Gérardmer Film Festival, among others. That short showed off Blanchart's penchant for blending horror, comedy and romance reminiscent of early Edgar Wright. He would go on to direct his debut feature, last year's high octane thriller, Night Call which made history as the first Belgian feature to win ten Magritte Awards (the Belgian Oscars), including Best Film, Best Director, and Best First Feature. Blanchart is currently adapting You're Dead Helene into an English-language feature at Tri-Star Pictures, after a highly competitive auction, which he will direct with Sam Raimi producing.

He also appeared in the 1960s war films ‘The Victors,' ‘In Harm's Way' and ‘Ambush Bay.'


							By 

	Mike Barnes


Senior Editor


	Jim Mitchum, who starred alongside his father, Oscar-nominated actor Robert Mitchum, in the 1958 moonshine drama Thunder Road while appearing in about three dozen films and TV shows during his career, has died. He was 84.


	Mitchum died Sept. 20 at his ranch home in Skull Valley, Arizona, after a long illness, a family spokesperson announced.




	The first-born son of Robert Mitchum and Dorothy Spence Mitchum, Jim Mitchum appeared in the war films The Victors (1963), starring George Peppard, Albert Finney and George Hamilton; the Otto Preminger-directed In Harm's Way (1965), starring John Wayne and Kirk Douglas; and Ambush Bay (1966), starring Hugh O'Brian and Mickey Rooney.

	He also had a part in Dennis Hopper's critical and financial disaster The Last Movie (1971) and made a short documentary about the experience working in Peru with Hopper, Peter Fonda and Kris Kristofferson called The Last Movie Movie.

	Mitchum's mom was determined to keep him out of show business as long as possible, but when he was 16, he was cast as Robert's younger brother, Robin Doolin, in the cult classic Thunder Road. It was his first credited film role. (The part was originally written for Elvis Presley, a family friend of the Mitchums, but he wanted too much money.)


	Also produced by Robert, the movie, about Southern whiskey runners pitted against federal agents and organized crime, was filled with car chases and stunts. Playing a car mechanic, James discovered a talent for tinkering with engines and had a stint as a stock car racer and real mechanic, notably working on Presley's hot rods. 

	











	He also appeared with his father in the 1961 war comedy The Last Time I Saw Archie, directed by and starring Jack Webb.


	Named for his paternal grandfather, James Robin Spence Mitchum was born in Los Angeles on May 8, 1941. When Dorothy went into labor, Robert was appearing as a Russian peasant in a small theater production, and he rushed to the hospital in full make-up.


	Jim and his parents lived a converted chicken coop behind a rented West Hollywood bungalow that housed Robert's mother, stepfather, three siblings and a nephew. By 1943, Robert was making enough money from acting to rent a house nearby — just in time for the birth of Jim's brother, Christopher, who would also become an actor. 


	James appeared in his first film, Raoul Walsh's Colorado Territory (1949), when he was 8, then attended University High School in West Los Angeles, where his classmates included Frank Sinatra Jr. He passed on college and a potential career in baseball to pursue acting.


	Inspired by Presley, he also flirted in 1961 with becoming a singer and was given a contract by 20th Century Fox. A baritone, he recorded a single, “Lonely Birthday,” but it never caught on.


	His acting résumé also included Ride the Wild Surf (1964), featuring Fabian and Shelley Fabares, and Moonrunners (1975), a comedy about the illegal whiskey business that echoed Thunder Road and was redeveloped as the CBS series The Dukes of Hazzard. He retired from acting in 1994.

	











	In 1968, Mitchum married late actress Wende Wagner, whose daughter, Tiffany, was 3, and they lived in the hills above Malibu. The couple had a son, Will, in 1969, before their marriage ended in 1978.


	While he was residing in Santa Barbara as the co-founder of a publishing company, Mitchum married Vivian Ferrand in 1985, and they moved to Paradise Valley, Arizona, where he managed his parents' quarter horse ranch, overseeing the breeding and racing operations. They had two kids, Brian and Caitlin Ann, before divorcing in 1995.


	After Robert Mitchum's death in July 1997 at age 79, Jim continued to breed racing quarter horses at his ranch in Skull Valley. In recent years, he developed a line of premium moonshine, traditional corn whiskey and Robert's Rye whiskey in tribute to his dad.


	In addition to his children Will, Brian and Caitlin Ann, his brother and his stepdaughter, survivors include his third wife, former English professor Pamela K. Smith, whom he first met in 1993 and married this year; another daughter, Ana; grandchildren Jack, Wagner, Paige and Winnry; and sister Petrine.


	His life will be celebrated privately by the family.


	Robert Mitchum was known for his performances in such films as Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo (1944), Out of the Past (1947), The Night of the Hunter (1955), Not as a Stranger (1955), Cape Fear (1962), Ryan's Daughter (1970) and Farewell, My Lovely (1975), to name just a few. He received his Oscar nomination for his supporting turn in The Story of G.I. Joe (1945).

	











	He and Dorothy were married from March 1940 until his death from lung cancer and emphysema. She died in April 2014.

Here are some of the best reactions to Swift praising Kelce's "magic Redwood tree" on 'The Life of a Showgirl.'


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


Taylor Swift‘s The Life of a Showgirl is getting mixed to extremely positive reviews from critics, and — most importantly — is being given a rapturous reception from her fans.


	But is one track is standing out in a very unique way: the explicit “Wood,” which is being called Swift's horniest, most blatantly sexual song of her career. And while songs about Swift's lovers often tend to be somewhat veiled, “Wood” is notable for being pretty obvious about who it's about and what it's about. Namely, Swift's fiancé, Travis Kelce. More specifically: sex with Travis Kelce. And more specific than that: Travis Kelce having a large and magical penis. While the song's chorus includes the refrain “knock on wood,” the title is not about, say, a coffee table. (“The song,” writes Stereogum, “is clearly and explicitly about Travis Kelce's dick.”)

					Taylor Swift's 'The Life of a Showgirl' Critic Reviews Mixed: "Hits All the Marks" vs. "Lacks Sparkle"		
			









	Before we get to the reactions, let's sample a few of the lyrics.




			Related Video		







	“Forgive me, it sounds cocky / He ah-matized me and opened my еyes / Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see / His love was thе key that opened my thighs.” 


	(One wag annotated that last line on the Genius song lyric site by dryly and helpfully noting: “Taylor Swift's vagina is located between her thighs”).


	Continued Swift: “Girls, I don't need to catch the bouquet, mm / To know a hard rock is on the way / And baby, I'll admit, I've been a little superstitious / The curse on me was broken by your magic wand / Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck / New Heights (New Heights) of manhood (Manhood) / I ain't gotta knock on wood.”

	











	Kelce's podcast is titled New Heights, which is helpfully capitalized in the official lyrics, to make the reference perfectly clear.


	First, here are some critic reactions from various reviews (read our full rundown of the best and worst The Life of a Showgirl album reviews), and then we'll get to the (more fun) fan reactions. 


	“Perhaps it was the sleep deprivation, but by the time her song ‘Wood' came on, I was beginning to wonder if I was accidentally listening to a parody album hallucinated by some porn-addled AI,” sniffed The London Evening Standard.


	“The horn section on ‘Wood' saves the song, which would be a misstep on its gauche lyrics and thinly veiled metaphors alone,” soberly wrote Rolling Stone.


	“The album's worst song … a skip if there ever was one,” wrote Business Insider. “[‘Wood'] is what might happen if you asked a predictive text machine to swallow memes about Swift's writing style and spit out lyrics about sex with her football player fiancé, then inexplicably set the song to Jackson 5-esque production. (Swift has written excellent songs about sex, by the way, including ‘Dress' and ‘Guilty as Sin?' — so I'm not saying she can't do it. I'm saying she didn't do it this time.)”


	“But by simply and innocently pressing play on ‘Wood,' I was forced to choke down a lumber truck's worth of information about Travis Kelce's dick,” wrote Vulture. “Swift sings that now she can stop ‘knocking on wood' because she has finally found the gigantic schlong of her dreams. But the ‘wood' is obviously meant to be yet another cheeky pun about Travis Kelce's member — in fact, it's the central pun, the pun that holds the whole song together. So what does she mean when she says she does not need to knock on wood? Isn't the point of the song that she's knocking the hell out of some wood? Ultimately it's not about the size of your dick pun. It's about knowing how to use it.”

	











	“Happy for you, Taylor!” wrote NPR.


	“One of the grooviest tracks on the album, ‘Wood' is exceptionally fun and another declaration of love — but also very much lust,” wrote THR. “But [has] perhaps the most giggle-worthy line.”


	“The most outrageous song she's ever released,” wrote The Independent.


	Now here is what some fans — including Nicki Minaj — are saying.


	“Oh Taylor #WOOD was EXACTLY what I needed tonight. Thank you,” Minaj tweeted of the song.


	“Is this Taylor's way of saying Travis's wood the biggest out of all of the boys she loved before?? Because GAG!!” one fan wrote on Twitter.


Another fan tweeted, “All I wanted was for Wood to be about Taylor Swift being dickmatized and The Life of a Showgirl is continuing it's streak of giving me all I've ever wanted” and then “'Wood' joining the list of Taylor Swift songs played at every wedding for the rest of time makes me so happy.” 


	Over on a Reddit discussion thread devoted to “Wood,” opinions varied. 


	“Y'all get so mad when she's having a good time. Let her get some good dick,” wrote one. 


	“These lyrics are quite possibly her worst ever, and I'm a huge fan of her lyricism,” opined another. “Girl, no. Just no. We don't need to know about the size of Travs boy parts.”


	“An inordinate amount of pearl clutching over this song,” wrote a fan. “Some people seem to think Taylor is still a 17 year old virgin who lives with her mom.” 


	“So, I have this (tacky, inappropriate, none-of-my-business) pet theory that one of the reasons the MH situation hit her so hard was because the sex was bad…like, really bad,” wrote another. “Then to contrast with TK who is not only sweet, but apparently lays pipe like a champion. Like, okay Taylor. Get that good dick. This song is corny as hell, but I'm happy for her.”

	











	“Laughing at how when the track list came out everyone was like ‘wood' can't possibly be THAT kind of wood, must be some metaphor or complicated something-or-rather, and then it turns out, yes, yes in fact it absolutely is that kind of wood,” wrote another. 


	Indeed. Two months ago, when we were all so innocent, a discussion thread on Reddit pouring over the Showgirl track list, speculated about the song: “My first thought was Pinocchio, a boy made of wood who just wants to be real. Maybe she can relate to not feeling like a real person or being treated like one?”

Keith Urban took the stage looking calm, cool and collected on October 2, 2025 in his first performance since word of his breakup and impending divorce from 58-year-old Nicole Kidman hit the news. A YouTube clip captured at the concert shows the 57-year-old country megastar strumming his guitar in a Hershey Bears jersey while playing hits such as “You Look Good in My Shirt,” and “You Get What You Give,” a song by New Radicals. 

The appearance, which took place in Hershey, PA, was a part of Urban's “High and Alive” world tour. PennLive.com says the artist happily told the crowd, “I freaking love you, Pennsylvania” at one point during the show.

As fans know, Kidman filed for divorce citing “irreconcilable differences” on Tuesday, September 30 in a Nashville court. The pair tied the knot on June 25, 2006, according to People's relationship timeline of the ex couple.

Notably absent from the stage was Maggie Baugh, the 25-year-old with whom Urban has sparked speculation of a romance after a flirty onstage moment in which he pointed towards her while singing the line “I was born to love you.” 

The rising artist's father has since come forward to reveal that he has met Urban in Las Vegas, but can't confirm that his daughter's relationship with Urban is anything beyond a professional one.

On October 2, Fox News published photos of the “Making Memories of Us” singer stepping off a plane in the first shots taken of the former “American Idol” judge since news broke of the split on September 30. 

The outlet pointed out that his wedding ring finger was bare.

A post shared by Fox News (@foxnews)

Keith Urban's October 3 show contained a reference to his ex, which has been a regular part of his performances during the tour. During the song “Heart Like a Hometown,” the screen flashed a photo of Kidman and the two teenage daughters he shares with the “Bewitched” star. 

Other than the photo, there were no references to Kidman or to the divorce during the show.

Backstage Country says Urban previously revealed what inspired him to write the tune. They quoted the star as saying, “So, a hometown for me became more about my family and my guitar because I was playing guitar at the age of six. So, home became like a place inside of me.”

[Editor's note: This interview contains mild spoilers for “The Ice Tower,” now in theaters from Yellow Veil Pictures.]

“Mulholland Drive” meets “Last Year at Marienbad” and the snow-flecked sagas of Hans Christian Andersen in French writer/director Lucile Hadžihalilović‘s coolly drawn, amorous, and elusive industry fairy tale, “The Ice Tower.” In other words, an irresistible hypnosis for cinephiles.

Hadžihalilović, the wife of director Gaspar Noé (who also stars in this movie), directs her ninth feature and first with Marion Cotillard in 20 years after the eventual Oscar winner's breakout movie “Innocence” in 2004. Cotillard here plays Cristina, a fading movie actress on set in the mountains of France, making an adaptation of “The Snow Queen.” Meanwhile, a teenage runaway named Jeanne (Clara Pacini) stumbles into the production after fleeing an orphanage, taking on a plum role in the film and falling under the wing and spell of Cristina, with whom she develops an obsession. One that becomes mutual, as a mother/daughter dynamic emerges, as does an erotic frisson, despite their age difference.

“The Ice Tower,” which won a Silver Bear Award for Outstanding Artistic Contribution from Todd Haynes' 2025 Berlin International Film Festival jury, opens in select theaters this weekend and is a must-see for fans of hypnotic cinema, the theremin-like soundtrack and woozy, dream-tinged cinematography by Jonathan Ricquebourg putting the audience into a trance. Hadžihalilović, as she told IndieWire over a Zoom interview in September, doesn't mind if you nod off or fall asleep or get lost in the trance of the film.

 










“It's a sort of fairytale, and it should be a bit like part of a dream and part of something real. At some point, the idea of blurring the border between the dream and reality was the purpose of the film,” she said. “A film could be a bit like a dream or sometimes a bit of a nightmare, if you want, and if you fall asleep at some point in your film, it's not a problem. It's maybe even better, because you will have a wonderful or very scary dreams that can help the experience.”

Despite the 20 years between “Innocence” and this film, Cotillard and Hadžihalilović hadn't exactly kept in touch, but a chance meeting at a party sparked her casting in the movie.

“We didn't keep any relationship between the two films,” Hadžihalilović said. “But it's funny how because of that, I saw her so many times onscreen, it's like my relationship to her was going on because I could see her, I could see her many faces, all the emotions, the things you can express. It's like being bonded with her during all these years, but in dreams, not in reality.”

“It was very late at night, and we ran into each other at a party. It was the first time we really spent time with each other again,” Cotillard said. “It was kind of a coincidence that you had this project, and then suddenly you ran into me, which was kind of like serendipity. She talked to me about the project, and I got so excited. I love working with people I already worked with.” Cotillard also said that “Innocence,” in which she starred as a boarding school headmistress overseeing a nefarious operation involving its students, is her father's favorite of all her films.

 










The below interview combines a conversation with Hadžihalilović and Cotillard over Zoom as well as a Q&A I moderated with Cotillard at the IFC Center in New York. It's been edited and condensed for clarity and length.

IndieWire: In this movie, Lucile Hadžihalilović's husband Gaspar Noé plays the movie director running the '70s film set, this recognizable archetype of the kind of filmmaker who mansplains Hitchcock to ingénues. You've never worked with him before. Have you wanted to?

Cotillard: I love Gaspar. I love his movies. He asked me once to do a horror film. I always wanted to work with him, but we had this conversation on the phone where I was like, “I cannot do that. I'm pregnant.” And he was like, “Even better!” And I was like, “Gaspar, no.” I really dedicate my life to a role, and I want to be taken entirely. Horror movies are hard for me to watch. I loved watching them before I had kids, but I was pregnant with my second child, and I said this is impossible for me to imagine going through horror while creating life. He's like, “Well, think about it!” I was like, no, no, no, I cannot do that. I've always had a very beautiful relationship with Gaspar, and I was very happy I could work with him in this film. I love that this character in this very enigmatic, dramatic movie is someone who is out of a comedy.

 










Clara Pacini, who plays Jeanne and your protégé in this movie, is a real discovery. Did she look to you for guidance to star in her first movie?

Cotillard: She didn't need my help. The first time we met, she came to my house, and it was snowing that day, and it was really not a snowing period, so we thought it was funny. So I was very intimated by her and also by, when I saw her, first of all she plays a teenager but she's much older. It was better for the things that we had to do, but I couldn't even watch her in the eyes because I had all those scenes in mind and I was just thinking, oh my god, what am I going to do with her? The character is really trying to destroy this poor girl, and I felt very shy. It's not intimidation, but I couldn't keep thinking of what I would put her through. She was shy, too. It was the first time we met, and it really created this very special atmosphere and energy between us that you can feel in the movie.

There is an erotic frisson between Jeanne and Cristina throughout the movie despite their age difference and daughter-mother-like relationship. But that culminates in a sexual assault at the movie's end. How do you read that scene?

Hadžihalilović: This teenager is fascinated by this beautiful movie star who has this very strong aura and, in a way, she's obviously searching for a mother figure. On the other hand, this actress has a fascination for the youth, for the beauty, for the innocence of this young girl.

 










Cotillard: Jeanne is fascinated by Cristina and the Queen. Cristina is fascinated by this young woman, and it has this feeling of being a vampire and wanting to suck the youth out of her. She feels good to see that this girl is fascinated by her in a period of time where her acting career is going down because of her age. As soon as she understands that Jeanne sees a mother in her, it's unbearable. She never had children. She didn't have a mother, so the mother figure is something that she doesn't want to look at, that she doesn't want to be. 

When they have this conversation on the couch, where she talks about her mother and that she has this feeling that she would see Cristina as a mom, then something twists inside of her and then she wants love, she wants to develop this relationship of love to go against and to not open the door to a mother relationship. That's how that leads to that scene where, at the same time, it's a sexual assault. And at the same time, it's like she wants to eat her.

Was this scene difficult for you, Marion?

Cotillard: We really worked on the kiss as a kiss that becomes someone who wants to swallow the other person, and it was very intense that day because honestly I didn't like that scene. I didn't like the feeling I was going through. I've never assaulted anyone and never thought that I would actually do this in a movie. We had a very strong connection with Clara that day because I wanted her to feel good. But again, you go through the feelings of your character. It was really horrible.

 










Hadžihalilović: When I began to write the script … I had not so much thought that it would be a real erotic or sexual bond between them. There is this mother thing, which is maybe the most obvious one, but I think she most of all [Jeanne] wants the kingdom or the queendom. There is this attraction from girls to women, and this pleasure to be in the company of women. Because it's a teenager… so it was not sexual. It was more a sort of being part of a female world.

How much rehearsal do you have to do on a scene like that?

Cotillard: We needed to rehearse. We had [an intimacy coordinator] on set. They asked me if I wanted an intimacy coordinator, and I said yes, right away. I really wanted her to feel comfortable, and if something was wrong, it's a good person to go to when sometimes you're too shy to talk to the actor, or talk to the director. We knew it was super safe, and I really talked to Clara about it and wanted her to feel comfortable and to feel free to say no if she didn't think it was OK for her. We really created a choreography so you know exactly what to do, and it gives you the freedom to experience the scene and be fully in your character because you know exactly what's going to happen.

So you wouldn't work without an intimacy coordinator again, I'd imagine, though you've obviously had many experiences without one.
 










Cotillard: You cannot just come on set and ask the actors to do the scene as they thought it would be because it's too violent, it's too strong, it's too emotional for you. Any sex scenes today, I would never go on set with a director telling me and the other actors or actress, “Oh let's do it, let's see how you feel.” No. I think it's a very important thing to really choreograph those scenes.

“The Ice Tower” is now in select theaters from Yellow Veil Pictures.

	The world hasn't even had The Life of a Showgirl for a full 24 hours, and it's already broken a streaming record on Spotify. Today, the streaming service announced that the new twelfth album by Swift broke the record for most-streamed in a single day so far in 2025, just 11 hours after its release.


	Swift replaces Playboy Carti's March album, Music, which had the most streams in 24 hours this year. During Good Morning America earlier today, Spotify revealed that 1.2 million users were streaming the album at that exact moment.


	Swift is on a Spotify streaming record streak. Earlier this week, she broke her own record for most album pre-saves, reaching more than 5 million and surpassing the record held by The Tortured Poets Department.

A post shared by Spotify (@spotify)


	“I can't tell you how proud I am to share this with you, an album that just feels so right. A forever thank you goes out to my mentors and friends Max and Shellback for helping me paint this self-portrait,” Swift wrote on Instagram following the album's release. “If you thought the big show was wild, perhaps you should come and take a look behind the curtain.”

	Spotify has been celebrating the release of The Life of a Showgirl all week, hosting a pop-up activation in New York City for fans to take photos in album-inspired backdrops and featuring previously unshared lyrics from the new record.


	A Rolling Stone review gave the new album five stars: “Showgirl is the castle she built out of all the bricks that have been thrown at her. She begged on her knees to change the prophecy, and the love she writes about here did just that. She lost her life's work, but now the empire belongs to her.”

Thirty years after prolific American indie auteur Edward Burns first broke out with his debut feature, “The Brothers McMullen,” the filmmaker and some of his onscreen family are back for something both new and old: a sequel.

Entitled “The Family McMullen,” Burns' 15th (!!) feature picks up three decades after the conclusion of his first film. While the McMullen family has been through plenty in the intervening decades, not much has really changed, as they're all still navigating big questions about life, love, and family, just now with a brand-new generation in tow.

 










Per an official release, “‘The Family McMullen' takes place 30 years after the famed ‘The Brothers McMullen' premiered and scored several film festival awards for independent films, including the Grand Jury Prize at the 1995 Sundance Film Festival, and proved a hit with U.S. audiences, making it the most profitable film of 1995. Written, directed, produced and starring then-newcomer Edward Burns, ‘The Brothers McMullen' explored the lives and struggles of three Irish-American brothers from New York.”

Like the first film, this new feature is an ensemble comedy written and directed by Burns “which tracks the romantic entanglements of a now-50-something Barry McMullen (Burns) and his 20-something kids, as well as his brother Patrick (Patrick McGlone) and widowed sister-in-law Molly (Connie Britton), who are also facing unexpected romantic hurdles.”

As Burns told IndieWire earlier this year, “It's the two brothers and the sister-in-law. I had to figure out a way to give Connie a primary role, and sadly for Jack Mulcahy the easiest way was to kill his character off.” Burns, McGlone, and Britton all reprise their roles from the original film, and are joined by McMullen franchise newbies Tracee Ellis Ross, Juliana Canfield, Pico Alexander, Brian d'Arcy James, and Halston Sage.

“I couldn't be more excited to be working with Warner Bros. and Fathom Entertainment to bring these characters back to the big screen,” said Burns in a statement. “My hope in re-exploring the McMullen clan was to make another film that would put a smile on the audience's face and remind moviegoers that home isn't just a place, it's the people you share it with.”

A Warner Bros. Pictures film, Fathom Entertainment will release “The Family McMullen” in theaters for a special one-night-only engagement on Wednesday, October 15. Check out the film's first trailer below.

Bruce Springsteen stopped by Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Thursday night to offer some much-needed words of hope — and also talk about the one time he tried doing karaoke.


	Near the end of the interview — which was conducted alongside Springsteen biopic star Jeremy Allen White — Kimmel asked Springsteen if he would mind sharing a few thoughts about the state of the country and the world. Springsteen obliged, with a statement that was at once concise and powerful.


	“Fifty years, I've been kind of a musical ambassador for America around the world,” he said. “I have this song, ‘Land of Hope and Dreams,' which is kind of a prayer to the country, and we play it every night. I know for a fact that that's how many people around the world still see our country. Not as a land of fear, not as a divisiveness, not of government censorship, not of hatred. And I basically believe that that's an America that's worth fighting for.”


	The rest of the interview, of course, was not as heavy. Springsteen and White largely chatted about Deliver Me From Nowhere, Springsteen recalled the story of how he stole the title for “Born in the U.S.A.” from a script sent to him by the filmmaker Paul Schrader, and he spoke about the upcoming Nebraska '82 box set, which will contain the long-fabled electric version of the album recorded by the E Street Band.

	Amid all that, Springsteen also shared another great story: About the first and only time he ever did karaoke. “I was in London in a little bar, they were doing karaoke, and I said, ‘I'm gonna get up and do some fucking karaoke!'” Springsteen recalled with a grin. 

	











	For his song, he chose the Temptations' “Ain't Too Proud to Beg.” Being that he is Bruce Springsteen, he figured he'd get up onstage, “sing a few notes,” and the bar would “go wild.” Instead, he quipped, “I got up there, I started singing, and they thought I was just another asshole who had gotten up onstage and was trying to do karaoke! It was really disappointing; I've never done it again.”

As our own Anne Thompson told it best in her recent profile of “It Was Just an Accident” filmmaker and beloved Iranian auteur Jafar Panahi: “Over the past 15 years, [he] has been imprisoned, blindfolded, interrogated, and put under house arrest with a 20-year ban on making films” by his native country. 

Next up for Panahi and his continued troubles with government bodies? Having to miss the New York Film Festival premiere of his latest film due to the United States' own government shutdown.

Variety reports that Panahi missed last night's screening of his Palme d'Or winner at NYFF, and the festival has also canceled a planned live chat today between Panahi and Martin Scorsese. The outlet reports that Panahi's trip was stymied because “his visa could not be processed in time” and “the culprit is the government shutdown, which kicked off on September 30 after congressional leaders failed to reach a funding deal.”

Panahi's latest is his first feature since he was incarcerated for several months in 2023 for criticizing the Iranian government. As he has often been forced to do in recent years, Panahi shot the film in secret. The film was inspired by his own experiences in prison.

As David Ehrlich wrote in his review of the film, “In his first project since the regime ostensibly lifted their restrictions on his art, Panahi draws from [his own] different prison experiences for a raw and blistering moral thriller about a hard-working Azeri man whose most tormented memories come rushing to the surface when he hears someone walk into his place of business with the same haunting squeak of his former torturer's prosthetic right leg. Played by Vahid Mobasser, a TV station programmer and part-time cab driver, Vahid impulsively abducts the man (Ebrahim Azizi, the only professional actor in this extraordinary cast), drags him into the middle of the desert, and digs a hole big enough to bury his pain alive.”

The film was a smash hit when it premiered at this year's Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Palme d'Or. In recent weeks, it was selected as France's entry for the Academy Awards. Neon will release “It Was Just an Accident” in theaters in New York and Los Angeles on Wednesday, October 15, with a national rollout to follow.

Here's a rundown of what music critics are saying about Swift's 12th studio album, from "every song is a potential smash" and "so much fun" to "nowhere near as good as it should be." 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


	The first reviews are in for Taylor Swift‘s The Life of a Showgirl.


	The pop icon's 12th album, released at midnight on Friday, is being hailed for the singer's return to upbeat pop following last year's melancholy The Tortured Poets Department, with Swift reuniting with Swedish hitmaker producers Max Martin and Shellback.




	Right out of the gate, the album's reviews are mixed to extremely positive. The notices range from glowing and effusive raves to somewhat disappointed takes (and one that's outright scathing). The early consensus seems to be that The Life of a Showgirl is fun, as you would expect, containing a compelling and diverse array of tracks, and is a clear step-up relief from the dour Poets. Swift doesn't hold back, both musically and in terms of her biting and obsessed-over lyrics. Yet the result is a bit uneven, and Showgirl doesn't fulfill the promise of a return to the banger-stuffed heights of 1989 and Reputation.

	Below we run down some of the review highlights and key comments from major publications, but first it's worth nothing that reviewing an album quickly is always rather dicey and it's not clear which outlets received the intensely guarded new album in advance (at least a few did, while others noted they started listening at midnight). We all know our impressions of an album can shift with repeated listens, and many fans have found this to be the case with Swift's recent albums.

	











	So with that disclaimer in mind, let's get to the reviews. The British critics, notably, seem a bit harsher than their U.S. counterparts.


USA Today: “Another triumph for the ultimate showgirl … a dozen brisk songs infused with the playfulness of 1989 and the velvet-sheathed-knife lyrics of Reputation … not since 1989 has Swift crafted an album where every song is a potential smash. ”


Financial Times (two out of five stars): “The singer's talk of ‘effervescence' and ‘bangers' has been inferred as a return to the big pop sound inaugurated by ‘We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.' But the results lack the sparkle of that song, while reinforcing its message that some things are best left in the past … the quality control blows hot and cold here … Her mellifluously conversational singing is as appealing as ever. But the promised bangers fail to materialize. Chart history may again be made, such being Swift's popularity, but this time inspiration has not struck.”


The New York Times: “A deceptively modest set of songs about the facade of fame, and what it takes to scrape it away and claw past it. Swift has been pop's alpha figure for more than a decade, a spot she's clung to ruthlessly. Showgirl isn't precisely a goodbye to all that, but it does cast a wary eye on her past while greeting her future with a glee that verges on the unbridled … A catchy and substantive but unflashy album, it takes the songwriting intimacy of her Folklore/Evermore era and renders it with more clarity and oomph … The lone false note is the stomping, moody ‘Cancelled!' in which Swift aligns herself with the villains of public life.”

	











Rolling Stone (five stars): “With her 12th studio album, the musician shoots into a fresh echelon of superstardom — and hits all her marks … The glitzy sheen across these glitter gel pen songs doesn't mean she's skimping on her signature detailed storytelling. She is as hilarious as ever, comparing a foe to a ‘toy chihuahua,' and thanking the haters that call her ‘bad news.' She's bolder than she has been, embodying a dick-slinging music mogul with eerie threats like, ‘You'll be sleeping with the fishes before you know you're drowning' … Showgirl is the castle she built out of all the bricks that have been thrown at her.”


NPR: “For the first time on a recording in a while, Swift is having fun. Her voice has never sounded stronger, the collaboration with her studio mates never easier … Showgirl is generally a sunny album, its pleasure rooted in its basic motivations: Swift's happiness with Kelce and her joy in flexing in the studio with Martin and Shellback. The love songs that set its mood are unreservedly sexy and most of all funny — including that dirty ‘Wood' — expressing genuine affection and delight. Showgirl also offers a couple of signature memory songs, one a classic that could have been on almost any of her albums and another adroitly up-to-date.”


The Telegraph (three stars): “It is a fine album — a witty, literate, mellifluous collection of overwhelmingly romantic singer-songwriter-style pop songs about the triumph of love, almost certainly spelled L-U-R-V-E. But for all its sophistication, Showgirl showcases Swift at her least dramatically intense … The overwhelming emotional mood is relief. It pervades the songs, a self-soothing blanket of gratitude that she has been rescued from solitude by a man characterized with all the depth of a cartoon fairy tale Prince Charming … After 13 very public romances and 11 albums about her turbulent love life, Showgirl represents 35-year-old Swift's happy ending. It is a long way from her persona as a modern everywoman, forensically dissecting the affairs of her battered heart. No one could begrudge her happiness, but Swift's new album has all the bite, realism and piercing psychological acuity of a Barbara Cartland fever dream.”

	











The Guardian (two stars): “Dull razzle-dazzle … The fizzing electronic pop of Reputation and 1989 is conspicuously absent. Instead, its primary currency is breezy, easy-on-the-ear soft rock: acoustic guitars, misty synth tones, subtle orchestrations and breathy backing vocals … More startling still is the distinct lack of undeniable hooks and nailed-on melodies … [The] album isn't terrible: It's just nowhere near as good as it should be given Swift's talents, and it leaves you wondering why. Perhaps romantic contentment simply writes whiter than vengeful post-breakup bitterness, or perhaps it wobbles your judgment. Perhaps it was rushed. Or perhaps its author was just exhausted, which would be entirely understandable. Even the immortal, it seems, sometimes need to take a break from pop's constant churn and unceasing clamour for content.”


The Independent (four stars): “Swift has seemingly raised the bar higher than any other artist can hope to reach — at least this decade. So what next? In the case of this album, her answer seems to be to go as rogue as she fancies. Sonically, this is one of Swift's most experimental albums, one where she flits between Stevie Nicks-indebted pop-rock (‘Opalite'), the Folklore-meets-Reputation backdrop of ‘Honey' — with its stuttery beats, fuzzy Hammond organs and cascading piano notes — and even Jackson 5 funk on the innuendo-ridden ‘Wood,' the most outrageous song she's ever released. In theme, too, she is giddy and in love one moment, pen sharpened and ready to draw blood the next. The Life of a Showgirl might be one of her most uneven records, but she's as compelling as she's ever been — the showgirl, the ringmaster and the circus all in one.”

	











Billboard: “Swift's eagerly anticipated Return to Bangers is not, say, 1989 Pt. II. Instead of coming back with party tracks, Swift has synthesized the commitment to pristine hooks that she shares with Martin and Shellback, an increasingly idiosyncratic lyrical slant, and the mid-thirties perspective of her past few albums. The result is a collection of songs that are immediately engrossing and among the most affecting of Swift's career, while also focusing on topics like Hamlet and suburban bliss. Call it Bangers for Adults … The Life of a Showgirl is one of the most grounded, well-rounded projects of Swift's career — a surprise, in the context of the hype preceding it. That doesn't make it any less successful.”


Business Insider: “The Life of a Showgirl has some of her best songs in years — and some of her cringiest … I certainly admire and applaud Swift for going full throttle and committing to her vision. Showgirl is the most brazenly pop-forward, melodically savvy, and structurally polished album that Swift has released in about a decade … Songs like “The Fate of Ophelia,” “Elizabeth Taylor,” “Opalite,” and “Father Figure” demonstrate Swift's ability to blend personal narrative with allegory, allusion, and vivid imagery, all without sacrificing a radio-friendly hook. If the rest of the tracklist met that high-water mark, Showgirl would be a pop masterpiece for the ages.”


The London Evening Standard (one star): “The Life of a Showgirl rollout has been repositioning Swift's squeaky-clean image as something more mature and sexy … Unfortunately, her once-famed lyric-writing abilities have not matured at the same pace; if anything, they seem to be going backwards … Perhaps it was the sleep deprivation, but by the time her song ‘Wood' came on, I was beginning to wonder if I was accidentally listening to a parody album hallucinated by some porn-addled AI … It's a well-worn story that rich people can still be miserable, but when you're a literal billionaire it's a bit tone deaf to complain about the lack of glamour. At this point it's a you problem, babe.”

	











The Times (four stars): “These are solid, hook-filled tunes, with production from the Swedish pop team Max Martin and Shellback, which head toward a classic style that recalls the soft rock ease of Fleetwood Mac, the country rock zest of Sheryl Crow, the doomed romanticism of Lana Del Rey. Most of all it sounds like Taylor Swift, expressing both the desires of everyday people and the realities of global fame in a way that is both approachable and impossibly out of reach … The Life of a Showgirl is essentially a companion piece to Reputation, but where that album railed against the vagaries of fame, this one accepts them, possibly because a fairy tale love story has made Swift a lot happier and more capable of handling it all. That's why it is so much fun.”

Taylor Swift's anticipated new album The Life of a Showgirl is finally here — and it's a glittering spectacle, filled with a cast of characters that includes close friends, rumored foes, and her football-playing fiancé.


	The record was created with Shellback and Max Martin in between shows on the career-spanning Eras Tour, which lit a fire in the singer-songwriter that blazes across each of its 12 tracks. With her returning production partners, she throws it back to the Nineties, wears George Michael's influence like showgirl feathers, and brings Sabrina Carpenter into her spotlight. She also tosses out her old adage about not getting lost in petty things and letting her nemeses defeat themselves before she gets a chance to swing. Instead, Swift sets off in search of a knockout. Here is everything we learned from The Life of a Showgirl.


	Looks like there's more bad blood in the Taylor Swift extended universe. “Actually Romantic” takes some pretty cutthroat shots at another pop star who has written music about Swift, one who knows an ex-boyfriend of hers and who may have called her a “boring Barbie.” Fan speculation both before and after the album arrived pointed to one potential new foe: Charli XCX. 

	











	Charli recently married George Daniel, whose bandmate and best friend is none other than The Tortured Poets Department muse Matty Healy. When Brat dropped, Charli had the internet buzzing with speculation about who Charli was comparing herself to on “Sympathy Is a Knife,” a song about her own insecurities when faced with the megastar she kept running into at her boyfriend's shows. On “Actually Romantic,” Swift sings, “High-fived my ex and then you said you're glad he ghosted me/Write me a song saying it makes you sick to see my face” before concluding that no man has ever loved her like this person does. 

	











	Neither song is really all that subtle but, for what it's worth, Charli explicitly said there were no diss tracks on Brat and that the song was more about her own insecurities. And when fans chanted “Taylor is dead!” at a show, she also spoke out against them and said she would not “tolerate” it. When Swift was asked to comment on the song and the state of her friendship with Charli, who opened on the Reputation tour in 2018, she lauded the British singer's writing as “surreal and inventive.” —Brittany Spanos

	Sometimes there's a little bit of mystery over who Swift might be singing about. Aaand then there's songs like “Father Figure,” which sure sounds like a scathing portrait of Scott Borchetta, her former label boss at Big Machine. Borchetta was the mentor who discovered her as a kid singing at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe — “When I found you, you were young, wayward, lost in the cold” — but then betrayed her by selling off her catalog to her arch-enemy, another S.B., a story she's told in several songs, from “My Tears Ricochet” to “It's Time to Go.” There's a lot of Godfather-coded mobster imagery in the song, like “I protect the family,” “All I ask for is your loyalty,” and most brazenly, “You'll be sleeping with the fishes.” But today, Don Swift settles all family business. —Rob Sheffield


	George Michael died nearly a decade ago, but his impact is larger than ever. This year, he was sampled on songs like Haim's “Gone” (“Freedom ‘90”) and Karol G's “Cuando Me Muera Te Olvido” (“Careless Whisper”). And now we have The Life of a Showgirl, because it's only right that the Eighties glam legend appears on Swift's most glam album yet. 


	Michael is listed as a co-writer on “Father Figure” — a not-so-flattering portrait of a mentor figure that most fans believe is about her former label boss, Scott Borchetta — which interpolates his 1987 classic of the same name. (It's possible Tay saw Babygirl and got inspired.) Michael's estate already gave their salute to the usage, writing that they had “no hesitation” and knew the late star would have felt the same. Michael also would have loved “Elizabeth Taylor,” as he was a longtime fan of the actress, performing at her AIDS benefit concert in 1992, and even describing her as “the last of the Hollywood greats” when she died in 2011. It's the kind of pop culture history lesson that Swift loves to teach us — just make sure you do all the extra credit and get graded on a curve. —Angie Martoccio

	Last year, Sabrina Carpenter told Rolling Stone that Taylor Swift's music is always there for her, even before she knows that she needs it. But on The Life of a Showgirl, it's Carpenter's turn to show up: Swift pulls the blazing pop phenom into the title track for the only guest feature on the album. “I hold her to such a different echelon,” Carpenter said after opening four shows on the Eras Tour. “I could never compare my life, my career, my trajectory to anything close to what she's done.” But “The Life of a Showgirl” makes the case that she could draw a few more comparisons than she gives herself credit for. 


	Carpenter's role on the record isn't to just throw in some backing vocals. Instead, she leads with all the best parts of her pop formula — ambitious vocal runs, cutting humor, high-scale theatrical drama — without shrinking herself. The song is part cautionary tale, part recruitment ritual. Someone who wants it badly enough won't be scared off by Swift singing, “All the headshots on the walls of the dance hall are of the bitches who wish I'd hurry up and die/But, I'm immortal now, baby dolls/I couldn't if I tried.” Here, Carpenter is the bravest of them all. —Larisha Paul

	From the very first song on Showgirl, the pop star revels in how things have changed since her last album with a nod to Shakespeare (you know the same playwright she referenced in “Love Story.”) Travis Kelce saved Swift “from the fate of Ophelia,” and this love seems to have opened up a whole new world she didn't know was possible.


	She's clear about this across the LP: Forget blue skies, he has painted her universe the minty, iridescent shade of “Opalite.” On “Honey,” she sings, “But you touched my face, redefined all of those blues,” letting everyone hear the newfound serenity in her trill. Swift even owns up to how badly she's always wanted the 1950s shit, like a wedding and marriage. “Things I said were dumb/'Cause I thought that I'd never find that beautiful, beautiful life that/Shimmers that innocent light back/Like when we were young,” she sings on “Eldest Daughter.” For Swift, Kelce has made sure everything has changed for the better. —Maya Georgi

Taylor Swift has released her new album, The Life of a Showgirl. The follow-up to last year's The Tortured Poets Department and its extended edition, The Anthology, features Sabrina Carpenter on the title track, as well as a sample of George Michael's “Father Figure” on the song of the same name. Swift worked on her new album with Max Martin and Shellback, the Swedish production duo who co-helmed much of 2012's Red, 2014's 1989, and 2017's Reputation. Listen to The Life of a Showgirl below.

On social media, Swift wrote:

Tonight all these lives converge hereThe mosaics of laughter and cocktails of tearsWhere fraternal souls sing identical thingsAnd it's beautifulIt's rapturous.It is frightening.———I can't tell you how proud I am to share this with you, an album that just feels so right. A forever thank you goes out to my mentors and friends Max and Shellback for helping me paint this self portrait.If you thought the big show was wild, perhaps you should come and take a look behind the curtain...The Life of a Showgirl is out now.

In a statement on social media, the George Michael estate said, “We were delighted when Taylor Swift and her team approached us earlier this year about incorporating an interpolation of George Michael's classic song ‘Father Figure' into a brand new song of the same title to be featured on her forthcoming album. When we heard the track we had no hesitation in agreeing to this association between two great artists and we know George would have felt the same. George Michael Entertainment wishes Taylor every success with The Life of a Showgirl and ‘Father Figure.'”

After announcing The Life of a Showgirl almost two months ago, Swift revealed the album's cover art and tracklist on an episode of New Heights, the podcast hosted by her now-fiancée, Travis Kelce, and his brother, Jason Kelce. Since releasing The Tortured Poets Department in 2024, she concluded her record-breaking, 149-date Eras Tour, which reportedly grossed over $2 billion in ticket sales and spawned both a companion book and a three-hour concert film.

In May, Swift announced she had bought back the master recordings for her first six studio albums, which she'd been steadily re-recording as the Taylor's Version series. She ended up releasing new versions of Fearless, Red, Speak Now, and 1989 between 2021 and 2023. A re-recorded version of her self-titled debut album is in the can, according to Swift, but Reputation (Taylor's Version) was never completed.

The project was produced by Max Martin and Shellback and features Sabrina Carpenter on its title track.

	It's showtime! Taylor Swift‘s The Life of a Showgirl has finally arrived after months of buildup, complete with 12 new songs.


	Released on Friday (Oct. 3) and produced entirely by the pop star, Max Martin and Shellback, the album finds Swift looking back on her past two years of life — which she largely spent on the road on her global Eras Tour. On “Father Figure,” she interpolates George Michael's 1987 hit of the same name, and on title track “The Life of a Showgirl,” Sabrina Carpenter joins her for their first official duet since touring together last year.


	“The Fate of Ophelia” serves as the LP's lead single, with Swift premiering a music video for the track in her The Official Release Party of a Showgirl event that will run in theaters all weekend.

	











	Arriving about 18 months after 17-week Billboard 200-topper The Tortured Poets Department, the 14-time Grammy winner's newest full length almost feels like a complete 180 for her. Following the black-and-white aesthetics and melancholy lyricism of TTPD, the high saturation and sparkles associated with Showgirl — which is comprised of flashy pop bangers — feel even more vibrant.


	Leading up to the release of Showgirl, Swift kept fans guessing about the project through a number of methods. Teaming up with Spotify, the singer dropped a handful of lyrics through a pop-up immersive experience in New York City, and with Apple Music, Swift revealed even more snippets by capitalizing “random” letters in her lyrics. 


	On Friday night, Swift will appear on The Graham Norton Show to promote the album. In the coming days, she'll do the same on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and Late Night With Seth Meyers.

A month ago, rumors began circulating in earnest that David Ellison, owner of Skydance (and now, thanks to some very practiced presidential genuflecting from the old management) the owner of Paramount, was thinking about handing the reins of venerable TV news organization CBS News to former New York Times columnist Bari Weiss. Now those murmurings are apparently set to come to pass, with the Times itself reporting on Thursday night that a deal to name Weiss “Editor In Chief” of Walter Cronkite's old stomping grounds could be announced publicly as soon as next Monday.

The Times quotes “three people briefed on the discussions between the companies,” who say that Ellison is moving forward with plans to buy Weiss' media organization The Free Press—of recent “Oh, I hope that AI movie bot is a sexy virgin!” fame—as part of a plan to install her somewhere at the top of CBS News. The deal would apparently value The Free Press, founded as a newsletter after Weiss left The New York Times in 2020 (in a cloud of complaining loudly about woke), at $150 million.

The Times piece doesn't provide details on what Weiss' new Editor In Chief job—a new position for the TV news organization—would entail, but earlier reporting by Puck‘s Dylan Byers stated that Weiss will report directly to Ellison, bypassing what would normally be several layers of buffering between the newsroom and the company's CEO. (The Times quotes sources saying CBS News president Tom Cibrowski will stay on in his position and “work alongside” Weiss.) It feels worth noting, in this context, that Weiss' career in media—which also included an earlier stint at The Wall Street Journal—has basically never involved, well, news. Although The Free Press does reporting, before founding it Weiss worked largely as a book reviewer, columnist, and otherwise as an opinion writer. Her success (without getting into value judgments or throwing shade) has been predicated almost entirely, not on reporting or traditional journalism, but on staking out cultural and political positions and presenting them aggressively and provocatively. Which is, presumably, the point.

News of the forthcoming deal comes late into what's been an extremely rough year for CBS News, and especially flagship program 60 Minutes. The network's news team was ultimately forced to watch management settle (to the tune of $16 million) with Donald Trump after he alleged that he had been hideously harmed by the editing of a Kamala Harris interview during the 2024 election; it's also faced major staff resignations, most notably from former 60 Minutes executive producer Bill Owens, who cited corporate pressure to shape news coverage as the reason he was leaving his job. In an interview back in May (before the settlement and subsequent sale), veteran reporter Lesley Stahl was already talking about “mourning” the coming days. She notably despaired at a public loss of faith in TV news, saying, “The public doesn't seem to want what we do to be part of our public life.”

Taylor Swift has stood atop the pop world, glittering in a sequined midnight-blue bodysuit with rainbow confetti falling at her feet. She has mesmerized stadiums packed with fans, whose screams and cheers registered on the Richter scale. She's broken streaming and chart records she herself has set. She's released a career's worth of music in a span of five years. Nearly two decades into her career, spinning in her highest heels, she has reached a whole new artistic and personal peak, each time reaching higher and higher than her last. Just when the world thought Swift couldn't climb any further, she did. Earlier this year, she bought back her masters, effectively owning everything that has ever been, well, hers. She also locked it down with a cowboy like her in football star Travis Kelce; the pair are now engaged, and it's like she has finally found her fairy-tale ending. 


	So there's no imaginable way she could possibly get any bigger, right? Well, that's where The Life of a Showgirl comes in. Only a sucker would think the curtain close of the Eras Tour marked the end of Swift's almighty reign in the pop sphere. With her 12th studio album, the musician shoots into a fresh echelon of superstardom — and hits all her marks. 

	











	From the first Fleetwood Mac-inspired drumroll and melancholy keys of “The Fate of Ophelia,” it's clear Swift has stepped into uncharted territory. The world might know how Shakespeare's Hamlet ends, and even how the latest chapter of Taylor's own love story goes, but the tantalizing melody shaped by a wondrous mix of steel guitar and Omnichord trills makes you want to keep listening to find out just how Swift changed her prophecy. 

	











	Notably, the pop star chose not to work with longtime producer Jack Antonoff, and instead forged a reunion with studio genius Max Martin and Shellback. But their return isn't just a callback to the grandiose synth-bangers of 1989 or warehouse-ready electric grit of Reputation. Instead, the trio takes from all they've each learned in the eight years apart to chart a whole new path.

	Unsurprisingly, The Life of a Showgirl is a stark departure from last year's deeply personal, prosaic, and tortured-as-hell The Tortured Poets Department. “There's nothing I hate more than doing what I've always done,” Swift wrote in The Eras Tour book. Where TTPD was a greige and drawn-out 31 songs, Showgirl is bursting with iridescent color and a tight 12 tracks. That's all by mastermind design, of course. No one could've known that when Swift played her Martin-era masterpiece “New Romantics” during the final Eras Tour surprise-song set, it was an Easter egg for the soundscape of this album.


	“You're only as hot as your last hit baby,” Swift quips against the thunderous glamour of “Elizabeth Taylor.” With that in mind, the singer makes scorching sonic choices. “Actually Romantic” is built around a Nineties rock riff in the vein of Weezer. That edge she never had on TTPD's “Clara Bow” — she's got it here, and it makes lines like “It's kind of making me wet” hit that much harder. It's exactly the kind of song fans have been clamoring for since Swift brought out electric-guitar versions of Red for 1989's  world tour.


	Meanwhile, “Father Figure” interpolates George Michael's song of the same title. But those Prince-like snares are rounded out with a full string orchestra of Swedish musicians. The same ensemble is present in totally different capacities across Showgirl highlights like the title track and “CANCELLED!” The horn section on “Wood” saves the song, which would be a misstep on its gauche lyrics and thinly veiled metaphors alone.


	“I want to be as proud of it as an album as I am of the Eras Tour, and for the same reasons,” Swift told Martin while they were in Sweden making the album. With its spotlight concept and showstopping production, Showgirl is the direct result of Swift's all-encompassing career feat — and an extension of it. She handpicks elements from all of her eras, just as she did on tour, and combines what works best. “Honey” is a sultry reclamation carried by both a Speak Now-style banjo and hip-hop beat from 1989, as a Midnights-esque Wurlitzer twinkles in the background.

	The glitzy sheen across these glitter-gel-pen songs doesn't mean she's skimping on her signature detailed storytelling. She is as hilarious as ever, comparing a foe to a “toy chihuahua,” and thanking the haters that call her “bad news.” She's bolder than she has been, embodying a dick-slinging music mogul with eerie threats like, “You'll be sleeping with the fishes before you know you're drowning.” She's even topping herself in the tortured corniness department — the “This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things” refresh “Wi$h Li$t” is littered with designer-brand references, and even one abbreviated “Balenci.”


	As she reaches for new heights, Swift still provides glimpses behind the curtain at her guitar-stained vulnerabilities. On “Eldest Daughter,” Showgirl's Track Five (usually Swift's most devastating song on an album), she makes brutal admissions like “I have been afflicted by a terminal uniqueness/I've been dying just from trying to seem cool” and “When I said I don't believe in marriage, that was a lie.”

	But with every step Swift takes, she sheds those feelings of loss and despair. Showgirl is the castle she built out of all the bricks that have been thrown at her. She begged on her knees to change the prophecy, and the love she writes about here did just that. She lost her life's work, but now the empire belongs to her. Everything you lose is a step you take. It's a lesson she even offers her lover in the bridge of “Opalite” when she sings “Failure brings you freedom.”


	For Showgirl's curtain call, Swift is even beckoned by the freedom that could come if she gives up her crown one day. The closing track, notably the title track, prominently features none other than Swift's understudy Sabrina Carpenter. The 26-year-old singer takes a full verse and even harmonizes with her idol for the sped-up, showtune-y bridge. It's almost as if Swift is passing the torch to the next generation of showgirls as she takes a bow. Could it be her final one? Well, no. This showgirl won't be left for dead; she's immortal now. “We will see you next time,” Swift promises as an audience cheers. After all, despite the rock on her finger, Swift is married to the hustle — and with an album as good as this one, she might even try to outdo herself, again. That's just show business for you.

Last last week, we wrote a piece about a company called Xicoia, one of what feels like nine billion AI video production companies currently trying to goldrush the planet to an early grave. The company's founder, Eline Van Der Velden, was at the Zurich Film Festival at the time, trying to plant an idea in the public consciousness: That the firm's new AI model—which it refers to as an “AI actress,” with the extremely irritating name “Tilly Norwood”—was about to be signed by a Hollywood talent agency. Van Der Velden (who's since posted a “please stop yelling at me” comment on the character's Instagram page) gave no real evidence for this claim, which didn't stop Deadline from parroting it in headlines, where it provoked frustration and irritation from actual actors who do not have time or energy for this particular flavor of horseshit.

Now, though, we've finally gotten our first piece of evidence that this AI homunculus that Xicoia is peddling might actually be a genuine Hollywood actress: “She”‘s just gotten a slobbering, sexually charged profile written about her by a much older male writer, who can't go a single sentence without implying how very horny he is for the subject of his writing. (But in, like, a complimentary way.) Verily, it's a true rite of showbiz passage.

We'll be honest: We have not read all of Professor Tyler Cowen's Free Press article “My Favorite Actress Is Not Human”; our familiarity with Cowen's argument here starts to run out right around the part where the text on the page starts to get all grey and blocked out. (Unlike, say, Paramount owner David Ellison, we don't feel particularly well-inclined toward tossing our cash at Bari Weiss' newsletter at the moment.) But even in the excerpts available to paywalled plebes like us, Cowen really seems to be swinging for the “never stop jizzing all over journalism” fences, describing “Tilly” as “beautiful, but not too intimidating,” “just the right amount of British,” and a “gorgeous innovation.” He calls the AI a “hot property,” with a focus on the literalism of the phrase that suggests that it being property is part of the appeal; his sub-hed states that “if you wish to see a virgin on-screen, this is one of your better chances.” It is a tour de force of letting the reader know you have a boner without ever saying you have a boner, and all in service of a model who looks lifted from the background of a semi-expensive Final Fantasy cutscene.

The AI era has been a feast of embarrassments for the species as a whole, as tech enthusiasts have attempted to state with a straight face that they like AI summaries, AI images, AI videos, and all the other generative garbage increasingly filling our screens. God bless Cowen (and, hey, Tilly too), then, for reminding us that some things are universally human: If you show a male columnist of a certain age and disposition a picture of a woman and tell him it's an actress, by god, he'll find a way to skeeve all over it.

Prince William has made a rare public mention of his brother, Prince Harry, while speaking candidly about his childhood, family life, and royal destiny in a new television appearance.

The Prince of Wales, 43, appeared on Eugene Levy's Apple TV+ series “The Reluctant Traveler,” where he discussed his hopes for his children and what kind of monarch he intends to be.

When asked about the prospect of his eldest son, Prince George, one day becoming king, William acknowledged the weight of the responsibility.

“It's an interesting question, and it's a big question, that one,” William said. “Because there's lots of things to think about with that.”

The future king explained that he wants to ensure his children inherit a more compassionate monarchy. “Obviously, I want to create a world in which my son is proud of what we do, a world and a job that actually does impact people's lives for the better,” he said. “That is caveated with, I hope we don't go back to some of the practices in the past, that Harry and I had to grow up with — and I'll do everything I can to make sure we don't regress in that situation.”

The comments marked a rare reference to his younger brother amid their ongoing estrangement. The relationship between the princes has been strained since 2020, when Harry and Meghan Markle stepped back from royal duties. The divide grew after the couple's 2021 interview with Oprah Winfrey, the release of their Netflix docuseries, and Harry's bestselling memoir — all of which criticized the royal institution.

Royal historian Robert Lacey, author of Battle of Brothers, told People that reconciliation remains difficult. “The rift is very profound and very long-lasting,” he said. “It will not be changed, in my opinion, until Harry makes a move and apologizes.” Historian Amanda Foreman added, “Everyone wants it to happen on their terms, but that's what makes it impossible.”

Recently, Harry met with their father, King Charles, for the first time in 19 months — a reunion one former royal aide described as “a massive step in the right direction.”

In the interview, William also reflected on his memories of Windsor Castle. “My cousins and I, and the family, would chase each other up and down here and do silly games,” he recalled. “I remember these carpets weren't here, and there were a couple of spots where you used to have to watch out because you'd get massive splinters… It was a really dark, wooden, oak floor.”

William emphasized his late mother Princess Diana's influence on his approach to parenting his three children: George, Princess Charlotte, 10, and Prince Louis, 7.

“Yes, definitely, I think it's really important that that atmosphere is created at home,” he said when asked about creating a stable family life. “You have to have that warmth, that feeling of safety, security, love. That all has to be there, and that was certainly part of my childhood.”

He admitted that his parents' divorce had an impact. “My parents got divorced at 8, so that lasted a short period of time,” he noted. “But you take that and you learn from it and you try and make sure you don't do the same mistakes as your parents.”

The majority of people have experienced a psychic phenomenon, according to new research. Here's what those strange “gut feelings” could actually mean.

On the morning of October 21, 1966, the Welsh mining village of Aberfan was struck by one of Britain's most harrowing peacetime disasters. After days of heavy rain, a slag heap collapsed off a colliery (a coal mine and its connected equipment) and tore down the hillside, submerging a school beneath a torrent of black sludge; 116 children died.

Warnings had come in more than one form. For years, villagers had raised concerns about the coal waste heaps perched above their homes. But some said the signs were stranger—uncanny, even. The day before the disaster, eight-year-old Paul Davies drew a picture of men digging into a hillside, with the words “The End” scrawled above the figures. That same week, ten-year-old Eryl Mai Jones told her mother she'd dreamt that “something black” had descended over the school. 

Both children died the next day in the deluge.

A new study by psychologist Olafur S. Palsson, PhD, suggests that so-called anomalous experiences—events that seem to go beyond what conventional science can explain—are not rare, but in fact quite common. Additionally, people who report experiencing premonitions, déjà vu, superstitious intuition, and out-of-body sensations often share distinct psychological attributes. 

These “strange-but-true” perceptions correlate strongly with a cognitive trait Palsson terms subconscious connectedness: the degree of interaction between conscious awareness and subconscious thought. The research, published in the peer-reviewed journal Psychology of Consciousness: Theory, Research, and Practice, found that individuals high in subconscious connectedness were significantly more likely to report frequent anomalous experiences, including:

“Some people have a much closer connection with the non-conscious or subconscious parts of their mind,” said Palsson, professor emeritus at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “Their consciousness and subconscious mind influence each other to an unusually high degree in everyday life.”

Using a newly developed metric called the Thought Impact Scale, Palsson surveyed more than 2,000 adults in the U.S. to assess “interactions between conscious aware thinking and nonconscious mental functions.” Respondents rate how much they agree with statements (on a Likert scale) about their various mental experiences and psychological traits, including automatic thoughts, intuitive insight, emotional resonance, spontaneous mental imagery, as well as the frequency of unusual experiences such as telepathic impressions, precognitive dreams, and uncanny coincidences. A clear pattern emerged: individuals with high subconscious connectedness reported such experiences far more often than those with low scores. 

Like extroversion or neuroticism, the trait varies from person to person, but stays relatively stable over time in each person. What changes, Palsson suggests, is how the trait manifests—the ways in which people interpret intuition, memory, or coincidence. For those with stronger subconscious input, the mind may simply register more of what others discard, Palsson suggests. 

“Anomalous experiences are something most people have at least occasionally,” says Palsson. “Our studies showed that 84 percent to 86 percent of adults repeatedly have at least one type of such experience. Neuroscientists suggest that the brain's default mode network—active during daydreaming and introspection—may play a role in generating these impressions. Heightened connectivity between regions of the brain responsible for memory, emotion, and prediction could explain the intensity or vividness of so-called premonitions.”

Might psychic foresight, hunches, or “gut feelings” confer some sort of evolutionary edge? Perhaps these anomalous experiences allow humans to make better sense of subtle patterns, according to Palsson. Or, perhaps premonitions and uncanny experiences point to something more banal: they might be explained by selective recall (remembering accurate predictions while ignoring those that never came true). Consider the confirmation bias and the “availability heuristic”—our tendency to remember emotionally charged events and forget the mundane. One-hundred dreams are forgotten; the one that coincides with tragedy becomes unforgettable.

Premonition might be less about glimpsing the future than about perceiving—consciously or not—subtle cues the mind is already processing. And in that sense, the inexplicable becomes part of how we navigate the world, not what's outside it.

Streaming platforms are still a contentious subject for creatives in the entertainment industry and audiences alike, but one benefit is undeniable — the accessibility of a streaming library allows people to discover shows and movies they may have missed out on when they first debuted. It used to be that people would discover their new favorite after browsing video store shelves, catching a stray rerun on cable, or having an older cousin introduce them to something cool from before their time. If you were lucky enough to come of age with the internet, forum discussions, lists published on your favorite online publication (like /Film!), or the omnipotent Tumblr gifset were methods of cultural sharing that allowed strangers to connect with one another over a shared love of film and television.

Now, the almighty streaming platform algorithm has done all the legwork, and audiences are frequently injecting new life into movies that initially flopped upon release or kickstarting a new obsession with TV shows that went off the air years ago. Recently, the Netflix animated fantasy horror series "Dead End: Paranormal Park," which was canceled two years ago, has been rediscovered by some people whose only knowledge of the show is some out-of-context clips. The supernatural series centers on Barney (Zach Barack) and Norma (Kody Kavitha), two teenagers who are hired to work at Phoenix Parks, a haunted Dollywood-esque theme park created by the famous Pauline Phoenix (Coco Peru). They're joined by Barney's childhood pup Puglsey (Alex Brightman) and Courtney (Emily Osment), the park's resident 1,000-year-old demon. It evokes the family-friendly scares of shows like "Courage the Cowardly Dog," "The Adventures of Billy & Mandy," "Scooby-Doo," and "Gravity Falls," but with the heart of shows like "Steven Universe" and my beloved favorite, "Craig of the Creek."

Well, having actually seen "Dead End: Paranormal Park," I can confidently say that this is exactly the kind of family show that Netflix should embrace, as well as the type of original series that makes streaming services worth having.

"Dead End: Paranormal Park" boasts some seriously dazzling animation, with charming characters presented in vibrant colors and rounded shapes like Steele's graphic novel come to life. Even with haunted mascots, demonic game shows, and a musical episode, the series transports viewers to a fantastical place, but with relatable messages about learning to understand yourself. Just as bold is the defiant joy at the center of the story, as the cast is incredibly diverse and better reflects the world at large. Barney is a Jewish, gay, fat, transgender teenager, while Norma is Pakistani-American, autistic, and bisexual. Nothing about their identities is presented as a plot twist or surprise reveal; it's simply the reality of who they are. There are also characters like the extroverted and optimistic Badyah Hassan (Kathreen Khavari), who wears a hijab, and Barney's crush, Logan "Logs" Nguyen, who often uses puns to diffuse awkward tension.

The show isn't about their marginalized identities, but it also doesn't pretend that their identities have no impact on the way they navigate life. In today's day and age, this shouldn't be revolutionary, but in a world where anti-LGBTQIA+ rhetoric is gaining terrifying ground, especially the kind targeting trans youth, it is. "Dead End: Paranormal Park" lets Barney be a teenager first: awkward, hopeful, and unsure of himself as he navigates crushes, friendship, and finding where he belongs. When Barney first tells Norma he's trans, it's presented matter-of-factly. He explains that this haunted theme park, of all places, is where he's finally felt safe enough to just be — to embrace on his own terms when and how to share who he is, because the people in his life aren't always as affirming.

Every queer person understands the profound significance of owning their identity and the unmatched euphoria that comes with living authentically, completely on their your terms. Seeing Barney, a trans teen, express this in an animated series is especially meaningful — mainstream animation seldom explores characters like this with such depth and care, although we've seen great progress with shows like "The Great North" and "The Owl House," as well as movies like "Nimona," just to name a few.

It's a shame that "Dead End: Paranormal Park" was only around for two seasons, because despite being set against the backdrop of supernatural scares and otherworldly creepies, the core of the show is a coming-of-age story. Barney works to process his feelings about his family's inability to be fully affirming of his identity, and he has to find the confidence to stand up for himself instead of constantly bending over backward to avoid making anyone else feel uncomfortable. He's a kind, empathetic, and enthusiastic teenager, but he has to learn the value of prioritizing his own happiness.

Meanwhile, Norma is constantly learning how to step outside of her comfort zone, working on her social anxiety, and allowing herself to be a part of a community. As an autistic character, she sometimes gets overstimulated or can be a little blunt, but the show doesn't look down on her for processing the world differently. The show loves both of these characters exactly as they are, and it only wants what's best for them.

There's a strong message about found family and figuring out where you belong, even if it means befriending an ancient demon at a theme park. It's impossible to be the weirdest person at a park that features demons, witches, ghosts, night hags, and phantoms, which means any kid watching at home can see that they're not "weird" for being themselves, either. And for parents, older siblings, or anyone else who may be watching, seeing Barney and Norma struggle is a way to remind adults that the young people in their lives need love, affirmation, compassion, and understanding.

"Dead End: Paranormal Park" is a quirky, fun time with a great sense of humor and a deep affinity for treating marginalized and misunderstood communities with love. If that's "propaganda," as some bad-faith loudmouths have accused it of being, it's a message worth taking to heart.

For the first time, scientists have detected trace amounts of phosphine in the atmosphere of a brown dwarf—a molecule that, on Earth, is produced only by living beings.

Wolf 1130C is an ancient brown dwarf located in the constellation Cygnus. Brown dwarfs like Wolf 1130C aren't planets or stars, though they have features of both. They're sometimes called “failed stars”: Their formation is star-like, but they lack the mass to continuously fuse hydrogen.

Previous research suggests that brown dwarfs should contain phosphine—which forms when phosphorus combines with hydrogen—given the conditions of their atmospheres. But past observers failed to find a significant amount of the molecule anywhere, puzzling scientists.

Now, in a study published in the journal Science on October 2, scientists report the detection of phosphine on this brown dwarf, thanks to the James Webb Space Telescope's infrared spectral data.

That doesn't mean there's life on Wolf 1130C, the authors stress—and brown dwarfs are not expected to be hospitable for organisms as we know them. Additionally, they hope to better understand the chemistry of phosphine to untangle how the chemical compound may form without the presence of life.

“We have to make sure we do the work of understanding all of the natural processes that can make this molecule, before we can rule them out and say there must be a biological source,” says Adam Burgasser, an astrophysicist at the University of California, San Diego, who led the work, to Katrina Miller at the New York Times.

In 1975, astronomer Jill Tarter coined a name for the objects she called “faint wannabe stars”: brown dwarfs. Their existence wouldn't be confirmed until around two decades later.

The finding also raises a question: Why hasn't phosphine been found in the atmosphere of any other brown dwarf? In their work, the authors say the molecule's presence on Wolf 1130C could be because of the object's older age and the low abundance of so-called metals—elements heavier than hydrogen and helium—in its atmosphere.

“It may be that in normal conditions, phosphorus is bound up in another molecule such as phosphorus trioxide,” explains Sam Beiler, a postdoctoral researcher at Trinity College Dublin and study co-author, in a statement. “In the metal-depleted atmosphere of Wolf 1130C, there isn't enough oxygen to take up the phosphorus, allowing phosphine to form from the abundant hydrogen.”

Or, Wolf 1130C's white dwarf companion may have generated the phosphine. A white dwarf is what's left over when a low-mass star has finished fusing its hydrogen. Wolf's neighboring white dwarf may have undergone nuclear reactions that created phosphorus, explains Burgasser in the statement.

All this uncertainty could mean that using phosphine as a biosignature is actually flawed—and the results may force researchers to reconsider their chemical models. More research may be needed to understand the molecule before treating it as a possible signal for life, as researchers did when they found it on Venus in 2020.

“The new data really demonstrates that we don't fully understand PH3 (phosphine) chemical networks in the context of atmospheres, so it is premature to rely on PH3 as a biosignature,” writes Mark S. Marley, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona who did not participate in the research, in an email to Fionna Samuels at Chemical & Engineering News.

But a better understanding of phosphine and phosphorus synthesis could help researchers better understand the galaxy, too—perhaps yielding insights that could assist in the ongoing search for life outside Earth.

“Understanding phosphine chemistry in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs, where we don't expect life, is crucial if we hope to use this molecule in the search for life on terrestrial worlds beyond our solar system,” Burgasser says in the statement.

Far-right activist Jack Posobiec is known for peddling conspiracy theories about the integrity of recent elections particularly in Pennsylvania.

Now, Posobiec, an outspoken MAGA booster best known for promoting the debunked “Pizzagate” conspiracy, is at the center of an investigative report showing that he is a Maryland resident who has been voting fraudulently in Pennsylvania elections.

A report by Slate, found that Posobiec, who helped amplify the “Stop the Steal” movement in 2020, has been voting in Montgomery County, Pa. for a number of election cycles, even as he was a Maryland resident.

Posobiec, 40, voted in Pennsylvania elections from 2004 to 2024, both in person and by mail, even though he has lived in Maryland at least a decade, according to Slate. The news magazine obtained documents, including a copy of his voting record, to corroborate the finding.

The report points to “extremely strong” evidence that Posobiec lives in Maryland, including public records such as a divorce filing, and most damning, Federal Election Commission filings showing his political contributions associated with a Maryland address.

Slate also perused Posobiec's prolific social media accounts, where he repeatedly boasts about his home and family life in Maryland; last fall, he even posted on X a photo of his Pennsylvania ballot marked up.

“SECURED THE BAG. Just stopped by the county voting board and did the deed - easy and even open on Sunday! Vote Early, Pennsylvania!” he wrote on the post, which was accompanied by two photos of him, including his marked up ballot.

In an interview with PennLive, Pennsylvania election law expert and attorney Adam Bonin laid out why Posobiec's voting record could be a crime.

“The law says anyone who votes or attempts to vote knowing that they don't actually have the qualification to do so has committed a misdemeanor and it's subject to a fine of up to $10,000 or imprisonment of up to five years based on what the court decides,” he said. “This is a crime. It is a crime if you know that you're not qualified and you keep doing it outright.”

Voter registration is based on one residential address.

In its investigation, Slate found that Posobiec used military and civilian overseas ballots until 2016. A year later, after resigning from his job as a Navy Reserve intelligence officer, he remained in Maryland. 

He continued voting in Pennsylvania via absentee ballots and, later, in-person on-demand mail voting, using his parents' home address in 2018, 2022, and 2024, according to an official copy of his voter information file from Montgomery County obtained through a right-to-know request.

Posobiec has aligned himself with far-right groups such as Charlie Kirk's Turning Point USA and was the mastermind behind the “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory, which claimed that Democratic politicians were engaged in runnning a pedophile ring out of a Washington, D.C. pizza restaurant. The false rumor inspired a gunman to fire multiple shots inside the restaurant in 2016, though no one was hurt.

But Posobiec, known for his vicious trolling of political adversaries online, cemented his status as a social media influencer pushing a slew of conspiracy theories about how Democrats, including former President Joe Biden, won elections with millions of fraudulent votes.

Posobiec notably helped get traction on election fraud conspiracies. The Republican National Committee last year filed a lawsuit against Montgomery County, a Philadelphia suburb, claiming the county had failed to ensure election integrity. 

“Why are you sending out illegal mail-in ballots, Neil?” Posobiec posted on X in October, directing his trolling to county commissioner Neil Makhija.

The lawsuit was eventually withdrawn.

“Petitioners have failed to produce any evidence that Montgomery County's process was unlawful or inaccurate,” Judge Richard P. Haaz opined, rejecting the RNC's claims.

He also accused Gov. Josh Shapiro of “disenfranchising” voters and echoed Trump's stolen election claims with social media posts about Pennsylvania counties processing thousands of fraudulent voter registrations. 

Claims of evidence alleging a stolen 2020 election were exhaustively investigated and litigated across scores of courts, and by state and federal officials, and were found to have no merit.

Bonin noted the irony of Posobiec voting, as the Slate investigation found, in Montgomery County.

“There's this line that we sometimes say in politics, every accusation is a confession,” he said. “It sure sounds like it here. I mean, this based on the facts....This is someone who has not lived in Pennsylvania in quite some time under any reasonable understanding of the law here.”

Posobiec would not be the first conservative to seemingly violate election law, even as they espoused debunked theories about fraudulent Democratic votes.

In 2022, Matt Mowers, a former senior adviser for President Trump, was caught having voted twice during the 2016 primary election. Mowers, at the time a New Hampshire Republican congressional candidate, cast an absentee ballot in that state, and then used his parents' address in New Jersey to vote in that state as well, the Associated Press reported.

While Mowers' actions seemed to have violated federal election law, he was not prosecuted.

“Let's be absolutely clear, voter fraud is incredibly rare,” Bonin said. “You only see it in rare circumstances and most of what we've seen is people trying to cast mail-in ballots for recently deceased relatives. Double voting is also pretty rare and people do tend to get caught because whether you voted is a matter of public record. It's harder to catch a single person who is voting in a different state without being qualified there because you really need people to know about it and investigate it like these great reporters have.”

Voter fraud cases are, in general, misdemeanor cases that often result in probation and a fine; rarely jail time. Posobiec has not been charged with any violation of voting laws.

“(T)hat's going to be up to the judge based on these facts,” Bonin said. “It's going to be up to the Montgomery County District Attorney's office and Attorney General (Dave) Sunday.

The county DA's office told Slate it did not comment on active investigations. Sunday's office would neither confirm nor deny that it had opened an investigation.

The Slate report was undertaken by independent investigative reporter, Jacqueline Sweet, and journalist Marisa Kabas, who launched the Handbasket, an independent political news publication.

Candace Owens and Tucker Carlson are at the forefront of alternative media, grabbing more eyeballs than ever, but also wrecking the emerging medium's credibility with loony conspiracy theories that are easily debunked. On Spotify's chart of top news podcasts, Carlson currently holds down the top spot, while Owens lands at number 3 – The New York Times's The Daily, NPR, and the Wall Street Journal grab the rest of the top five spots.

As traditional media continues to shed viewers and more and more Americans, especially young people, tune into podcasts and scroll social media for their news, the likes of Owens and Carlson are shaping the discourse more than ever. Unfortunately, much of their content is utter and total nonsense, and leans into age-old stereotypes and bigotry to grab headlines and remain provocative.

The divergence between the fact-based podcasts, like The Daily and WSJ, and what Owens and Carlson are peddling on their shows has never been further apart, ensuring that Americans are living in dangerously different realities.

In the weeks since Charlie Kirk's horrific murder, Owens has unabashedly pushed conspiracy theory after conspiracy theory, claiming everything from a federal cover-up, to there being a female accomplice, to suggesting his assassination was connected to Jewish and pro-Israel forces being angry with him. Carlson, too, has been out with outlandish claim after outlandish claim, including his most recent claim that Israeli military officials were “demanding” U.S. military officials inside the Pentagon do as they say during the recent Israel-Iran conflict.

Carlson, since his days at Fox News, has long been famous for “just asking questions,” and has made claim after claim over the years that have proven not to be the case. Earlier this year, he argued that Trump bombing Iran would mean “Thousands of Americans would die. We'd lose the war that follows.”

Owens famously said in March of 2024, “ I would stake my entire professional reputation on the fact that [French First Lady] Brigitte Macron is in fact a man.” The Macrons are now suing Owens in a 22-count defamation lawsuit. Carlson, of course, declared in March of this year, “And I was like, ‘Ah, Candace Owens, I love you, but I think this is too crazy.' And then it turns out she's right! My mind is blown!”

Independent journalist Nathan Livignstone put together a short clip of Carlson and Owens pushing some of their recent conspiracy theories and wrote:

The Candace Owens + Tucker Carlson School of Journalism:

Step 1: Make an outrageous claim with NO PROOF Step 2: Demand YOU disprove it

Even Carlson and Owens's biggest fans and defenders must understand that this is all they are doing. Clearly, they tune into them for something other than facts. At their most basic level, both Owens and Carlson profit in media by offering their viewers a sense of tribal belonging – pointing out over and over again who their perceived enemies are. While their approach certainly is working for them, Owens and Carlson are doing untold damage to both the country and the credibility of alternative media.

To be fair, many on the right have already tired of Owens's antics. The MAGA influencer known as Catturd posted on Thursday, “Candace Owens is just a few days away of blaming Charlie Kirk's assassination on Kermit the Frog. You know I'm right – it's coming.”

Others, however, remain willfully blind in the name of partisanship. Megyn Kelly recently defended Carlson as her friend, and refused to condemn both Carlson and Owens over their use of  Kirk's death to spread anti-Semitism and promote themselves.

“As for my decision to ‘platform' Tucker: Too bad. Too f*cking bad,” Kelly told a podcast this week on the topic, adding, “I don't think he's an anti-Semite at all.

She later added, “ I think Tucker's a very important, valuable voice in the national conversation.”

Carlson, who is also out right now with a 9/11 truther documentary, has jumped further and further off the rails in recent months – going so far as to claim he was physically attacked by a demon. RedState columnist Bonchie highlighted one of Carlson's recent interview subjects, Elizabeth Lane, noting, “She has 3.3K followers. No one knows who she is. She's a 9/11 truther, pro-Putin, and an antisemite. So naturally, she gets an interview on Tucker Carlson's show. Makes sense.”

Earlier in the week, Kelly gave the game away when she said, “My fight is with the left, not these two,” making clear that whether or not she agrees with the likes of Tucker and Candace, she will defend her tribe no matter what. And in our current state of hyper-polarization, Kelly is undoubtedly doing what's best for business; even if it comes at the expense of upholding any kind of journalistic principles.

With Owens and Carlson leading the alternative media revolution, they have turned what could have been a journalistic project to speak truth to power into an entertainment-based grift, feeding into the worst impulses of American media consumers and sowing further division and hate.

The airship-like S1500, the world's largest flying wind turbine, recently became the first device of its kind to generate one megawatt of power during a test flight.

Wind turbines are already a big part of China's big bet on renewable green energy, but the Asian country is always looking to lower the cost and increase the efficiency of its installations. That's how it came up with a versatile inflatable turbine capable of being relocated quickly while generating significant amounts of electricity. The S1500 floating wind power system is about as tall as a 13-storey building and as long as a basketball court. It looks like a giant floating airplane engine and it is capable of operating at heights of up to 1,500 meters, where winds are faster and more stable than at the level of traditional towers (approximately 200 meters).



Developed by Beijing Linyi Yunchuan Energy Technology Co. Ltd., the world's largest flying wind turbine features a main helium-filled gasbag with a ring wing, which forms a giant duct that harnesses the stable high-altitude winds to drive the rotor. With the help of 12 generators rated at 100 kilowatt, the ingenious power-generating system transmits electricity steadily to the ground through tethering cables.

One of the main advantages of lying turbines is that they don't require the construction of large metal towers and rotors, which can reduce the cost per kilowatt-hour by 30%. The inflatable design also makes them extremely easy to move across long distances.



Beijing Linyi Yunchuan Energy Technology Co. Ltd. plans to begin mass producing S1500 wind turbines starting next year, but there are still challenges to overcome, such as regulatory frameworks and safety standards, demonstrating the stability of the installation in extreme weather conditions, and the durability of its components.

“We look forward to making airborne wind power an important component of affordable green electricity,” Dun Tianrui, CEO of eijing Linyi Yunchuan Energy Technology Co. Ltd., said.

Spirits are at the heart of Buzzard's Roost Distillery, and it goes well beyond the whiskey behind the bar.  

Many staff members believe a few highly active ghosts haunt the distillery at 624 W. Main St. in Louisville.

This spooky season, the distillery and the nearby Hereafter Speakeasy, 119 S. Seventh St., are inviting bourbon fans and the paranormal curious to a two-hour, $70 experience geared at tapping into both kinds of spirits. The experience invites guests to sample bourbon at Buzzard's Roost and a cocktail at Hereafter. All the while, guests learn the lore of the buildings and even attempt to communicate with the spirits that haunt them.

At one point, Buzzard Roost's resident basement ghost “Gandano” may even select which bourbon is tried next.

I attended the inaugural tour on Sept. 26, and after an evening of fine bourbon and trying to engage with ghosts — I'm not necessarily convinced I personally connected to the spirit world. 

What I can tell you, though, is that some very curious things have happened on the 600 block of W. Main Street in downtown Louisville.

And whether or not you're a believer, this new unique mix of bourbon and the paranormal is hauntingly entertaining.

The partnership between the bar and the distillery was a natural one, Laura Coomes, Buzzard's Roost's vice president of marketing, told me. Ryan Svab, who co-owns Hereafter, also bartends at Buzzard's Roost. When the distillery teamed up with Fen Alankus of Feralore and her paranormal investigative team for a two-night investigation, it made sense to do one at Hereafter, as well.  

Two centuries ago, the 600 block of W. Main Street was Louisville's hub for commerce. Local lore says the upstairs mezzanine at Hereafter was once a Civil War map room. In the late 1800s, three major fires happened on the block, and the last one burned all the way through what's now Buzzard Roost. Five firefighters died that day, and Alankus' team believes they've connected with two of them, “Captain Edward” and “John.” A couple of years after the fire, a tornado blew through and took out the north side of the street. More than 100 people died in the storm.

That kind of history and devastation can be fertile ground for paranormal investigations.

“There's certain parts of the building where you just feel like you're not alone,” Coomes told me ahead of the tour. “And we feel like, we're guests in the building. They're definitely not out to hurt us. I think they're glad that we're here.”

As Coomes, Svab and Alankus carved out this experience, they knew they wanted to do more than tell ghost stories. They wanted to give their guests a chance to interact with the ghosts and decide for themselves whether they believed anything supernatural was there.  

“There's no guarantees of what you're going to see and experience, because we think it's going to be different every single time,” Coomes told me. “Even though we've planned it out, every person is going to have a different type of time."

The inaugural tour was an experiment of sorts, and while the paranormal team and the business owners have a formula for the experience — much of the activity depends on the engagement of the guests and the ghosts.

The first tour was relatively intimate. Beyond me, only two couples from Pennsylvania, who knew each other, had signed up for it. One was a skeptic. Another said she often speaks to a spirit she believes is in the office where she works.

The other three of us fell somewhere in the middle.

We started the tour in the still room where Buzzard's Roost brand ambassador Jimmy James Hamblin offered us a pour of whiskey, while Alankus and Coomes talked us through the building's history. Over the years, it has been a hat store, a dry goods store, a stationery company and most recently, an ad agency.

Since Buzzard's Roost opened in 2023, the staff has experienced unexplained broken glasses, books falling off the shelf and many elevator and electronic glitches. Once, during a farewell party for a beloved employee, guests watched a tiramisu flip over all on its own. Coomes has seen unexplained orbs fluttering in upstairs offices on the security cameras. Bartenders hear footsteps when they're alone, only to discover no one is there.

Hamblin doesn't believe in ghosts, but he also doesn't have an explanation for the books he's seen fall around him.

From the still room, we headed to the speakeasy in the basement. There, the paranormal investigators played us a recording of an unexplained noise they captured in this room during their investigation. In the middle of hours worth of silence, the recorder picked up what could be a muffled man's voice saying “dimes.”

Then Alankus introduced us to “Gandano,” who had previously told her this nickname using a Ouija board.

She held up a pendulum from which she showed our group how to use it to channel answers from beyond. In this case, if it swung in a circle, it meant the ghost said “yes.” If it moved side to side, she believed Gandano, was saying “no.”

In theory, you could use these yes or no questions to learn about his life and preferences. Or, you could use it to choose what type of Buzzard's Roost bourbon we should drink.

“Are you cool with choosing the whiskey that we're going to try first,” Alankus asked him. “Go on Gandano, tell us.”

The pendulum swung in a small circle near Buzzard's Roost's smoked barrel rye whiskey, which has previously won a double gold medal at the San Francisco World Spirits competition. Hamblin served the blended three-year-old rye finished in toasted barrel, which had a smooth, almost vanilla taste.

As we sipped on that, Alankus showed us a pair of divining rods. Like the pendulum, Alankus explained that the position of these L-shaped rods could be used to answer yes or no questions. After a short test, we learned that when the rods swung apart, Gandano was saying “no” and if they crossed, it meant “yes.” 

And this is where the real fun began.

So much so, eventually Hamblin ended up choosing the second and third pours of whiskey for us, instead of Gandano. Our little group was having too much fun trying to learn about the spirit to give him another shot at selecting a bourbon.

“Gandano are you Italian,” one woman asked, and the rods positioned themselves into a “no.” 

“Gandano are you an orphan,” Coomes asked.

“Yes.”  

“Gandano were you the voice on the recorder?” Hamblin asked.

“No.”

“Gandano are you alone?”

“No.”

This kind of banter went on for about 25 minutes, until finally it was time to head around the corner to Hereafter.

“I would like to know if Gandano enjoyed himself this evening,” Hamblin asked, playfully.

“Yes.”

I sighed and smiled in relief. Whether or not we were speaking to the dead ― at very least we hadn't ticked this supposed spirit off.

Around the corner at Hereafter, we wound through the downstairs concert venue and then to the upstairs bar. The paranormal team had set out stacks of tarot cards. Each card had a corresponding cocktail that went with it, which left the final drink of the night in fate's hands.

I pulled the Lover card, and the bartenders mixed up Manhattan-like libation for me, as we settled into the second and final stop of the tour.

Hereafter is one of the most active spaces Alankus has ever investigated. Co-owner Svab and some of her staff believe they've seen a male apparition in a dark work suit roaming the building. Several workers have also described seeing a few 20-something, red haired men with a mischievous vibe. Those boys, in theory, enjoy turning lights on and off and knocking things off the wall.

“There's lots of creepy weird things there, but not scary things,” Svab told me. 

Just last week, one of the bathrooms locked itself from the inside for hours. They worried someone might be in trouble inside, and then when the staff finally got the door open — no one was there.

“To generate that kind of energy as an entity as far as we understand it, takes a lot,” Alankus said.

As we sipped our fortune cocktails, the team passed around a collection of sensors designed to detect electro-magnetic energy or unexplained changes in temperatures.

They encouraged us to wander the bar and music venue to see if any of the decor might seem sensitive. Svab keeps a “cabinet of curiosities” filled with creepy dolls and bizarre antiques in the downstairs bar, and she said many of the objects seem to have a supernatural charge to them. She has several bubble portraits from the 1800s decorating the walls that her staff suspects might have a spirit connected to them.

But really, most of the supernatural activity at Hereafter occurs when the building is quiet and only one or two people are there. As I took the sensor around, I wondered if the full music venue below, the busy bar and our curious, increasingly intoxicated group, might be too much for the spirits to show themselves. We only had a few minutes on the tour left, and the lights on my sensor wouldn't budge.

Then, for whatever reason, as I talked with the believer in the group about her daughter, Julia, the sensor showed a moderate presence. Every time one of us said the girl's name, the lights flickered.

So then the woman tried calling out to other significant names in her life.

“Catherine," she said, pausing. "Sissy? Agnes?”

No luck.

I was just about to put my sensor down and call it a night when conversation in the group turned back to those red-headed, mischievous, 20-somethings.

“If I'm in the spirit world,” someone mused. “And I'm observing, and I'm watching what's going around, what would be my motivation to throw a picture or to mess with people?"

Right as she said “mess with people” every light on my sensor went off, as though that was the answer.  

Those boys must have a sense of humor.

And candidly, that was enough to convince me it was time to call it a night and explore the spirits downtairs behind the bar ... rather than tempt these red heads into "messing" with me from the afterlife.

Horror enthusiasts and Final Destination loyalists have reason to celebrate once again. After thrilling audiences worldwide with its spine-chilling scenes and record-breaking box office performance, Final Destination: Bloodlines is all set to make its OTT debut in India. The sixth instalment in the cult franchise, which introduced new phobias will now be available for streaming on JioHotstar from 16th October onwards.

JioHotstar took to Instagram to announce the much-anticipated release, sharing the film's poster with the caption: “Death runs in the family. Final Destination: Bloodlines streaming 16th October onwards in English, Hindi, Tamil and Telugu only on JioHotstar.” The announcement has left fans buzzing with excitement as they prepare to revisit the franchise that has defined horror for decades. For fans who missed the theatrical run, this digital release offers the perfect opportunity to experience death's terrifying game of fate from the comfort of their homes.

About Final Destination: BloodlinesDirected by Zach Lipovsky and Adam Stein from a screenplay by Guy Busick and Lori Evans Taylor, the film stars Kaitlyn Santa Juana, Teo Briones, Richard Harmon, Owen Patrick Joyner, Anna Lore, Brec Bassinger, and Tony Todd in key roles. The story follows college student Stefani Reyes, who inherits haunting visions of a 1968 premonition that prevented a deadly skyscraper collapse from her dying grandmother, Iris. With Iris's chilling warning that “Death is coming for their family,” Stefani is forced into a relentless battle against fate itself. Upon release, Final Destination: Bloodlines received overwhelming praise from both critics and audiences, quickly becoming the most successful film in the franchise. With its inventive death sequences, self-aware humour, and gripping storyline, the film managed to exceed expectations, grossing an astonishing ₹2,430 crore worldwide, making it the highest-earning instalment in the series. The Hindustan Times review highlighted the film's campy brilliance, stating: “What works the most for Final Destination Bloodlines is its refusal to ever take itself seriously. The campy feel, which horror lost a decade ago, is what makes it great. From references to horror tropes to hilarious red herrings and some clever jokes, the humour of the film is macabre but never sick. Yet, you may find yourself questioning your own morality the fifth time you chuckle or marvel as a character meets a gruesome demise. But then that is the beauty of this franchise. It makes death entertaining and beautiful. And it has never looked more stunning than in Bloodlines.”

The weekend before last, I was asked to stand in memory of Charlie Kirk.

“It just seems the right thing to do, it seems the noble thing to do, it seems the correct thing to do, for us to stand in a moment's silence to honor a great warrior,” the speaker implored.

I was not inside the more than 63,000-seater State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, where Kirk's official memorial ceremony took place. I wasn't even in the United States.

I was in a derelict shed in the town of Boyle in the northwest corner of Ireland listening to Vincent Carroll, a doctor turned Covid vaccine conspiracist. He spent the rest of his speech ranting about the threats posed by Muslims who, in his telling, want to “change” Irish society in their image.

Carroll, who did not respond to a request for comment, was one of more than 20 speakers at the Rebels Across the Pond conference, a gathering designed to strengthen ties between conspiracists and far-right extremists on either side of the Atlantic.

The event and the rapid speed with which Kirk's killing has become a central narrative for overseas groups show once again how influential the US far right has become on a global scale. Carroll was one of many speakers who invoked Kirk's name during the event. Another was Eddie Hobbs, a former prominent TV presenter in Ireland who in recent years has launched a YouTube channel that flirts with conspiracy theories and now views his former employers as enemy number one.

“My job is to go for the jugular against the Irish media on my channel, and I will do that until or unless I end up like Charlie Kirk,” Hobbs told the audience, which then pleaded with him to run for political office.

Hobbs subsequently told WIRED that he doesn't actually believe that he might be assassinated because of his beliefs.

Boyle is an idyllic town of just 3,000 people in County Roscommon, best known for being the birthplace of Bridesmaids and Black Mirror actor Chris O'Dowd. But since 2017 it has also been the home of Mark Attwood, an Englishman who in 2023 established Live 5D Health, which its website describes as “a private members holistic wellness club,” in the town. In addition to mainstream services like saunas and steam rooms, the club offers more esoteric services such as the Orynoco Healing Pod, described on the club's website as being powered by “quantum healing we can't really explain.”

Attwood is a well-known figure in the online conspiracy world, running a popular video podcast series and Substack where he covers everything from QAnon to the threat that demons pose in your everyday life. Leveraging his connections in this world, Attwood organized the event, inviting many of the people he speaks to on his show to travel to Boyle. (Attwood did not respond to WIRED's request for comment.)

On Saturday morning, having stumped up $170 to attend the conference, I was forced to sign up for membership at Live 5D Health before receiving a wristband that would guarantee me access to the event. Inside the club, among the alternative treatments on display, was the Pure Body Extra detox treatment that the anti-vax community has claimed in the past can be used to treat autism, despite the product's manufacturer stating on its website that it is “not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.”

The location for the event, which was kept secret over concerns about protesters showing up, turned out to be a venue normally used as a roofed beer garden and music venue for a local pub on the banks of the River Boyle, just a few minutes away from Live 5D Health. Previously, one local told me, it was among other things the location for a professional chainsaw workshop.

Before the event began, the attendees milled about outside, speaking to those who were advertising wares and services. I spoke to Louis Sexton, who was selling black stone medallions under the Atlantis Round Towers of Eire brand. He claimed the items could provide more energy or focus, adding that he had located the special stone using instruments he collected during his time working in the nuclear energy industry. One woman next to me quickly handed over €150 ($180) for three medallions.

Further down the table, other people were talking to Martin, a representative from the PanTerraVida Private Society, a sovereign citizen–style organization. It's unclear if anyone signed up. Martin did not respond to a request for comment.

Inside the hall, attendees filled rows of white chairs that would have been more at home at a wedding. The attendees were split pretty evenly between men and women, and while the average age was certainly over 50, there were a couple of dozen in their twenties. Amulets, gemstones, and bare feet were on display, as well as one woman wearing a green “Make Ireland Great Again” baseball cap.

The majority of attendees were from Ireland, though one woman came from the east coast of Scotland, a group from Germany, and another woman from the Netherlands.

At the front of the hall, which Attwood said he had cleansed with sage the night before, a stage was adorned by a large-screen TV and flanked by large speakers. At the front of the stage someone had hung a T-shirt bearing the phrase “Hey Satanists, Go Fü¢% Yourselves.”

Also on the stage was a device purportedly emitting scalar waves, in line with an unproven pseudoscientific concept that suggests invisible energy can help heal a variety of ailments.

Attwood opened the conference by talking about his own experiences with demonic forces, including a claim that while he was in his kitchen chopping vegetables, someone beamed a voice into his head using “voice to skull” technology that instructed him to “kill your children.”

Over the course of the next seven hours, without a break, speaker after speaker filled the stage with wild allegations about child sex trafficking, global elites controlling the world, anti-trans rhetoric, and the coming Rapture—though not the one that was meant to happen within days.

Jana Lunden, an anti-trans activist from America now living in Ireland, said “the tsunami of what is happening in America is coming over to Ireland.”

As an example, she claimed she recently met in Dublin with Kimberly Fletcher, the head of the far-right activist group Moms for America, which has close ties to members of the Trump administration. Lunden said that they had discussed her heading up an Irish chapter of an international women's movement and added that she would be traveling to Washington, DC—where, she said, she would “hopefully” not need a bulletproof vest. She claimed that a meeting at the White House was a possibility.

(Lunden and Moms for America did not respond to requests for comment.)

Following Lunden on stage was Fergus Power, a prominent Irish far-right agitator who was named, using parliamentary privilege, by an Irish lawmaker who implied he was among those who incited the Dublin riots in November 2023.

He told the audience that “God has chosen me for this battle” and that he won't stop until “every indigenous man, woman, and innocent Irish child in this country truly knows the meaning of the word freedom.”

Power, who is followed on X by disgraced former national security adviser Michael Flynn, has been at the forefront of the far right's recent anti-migrant campaign, which demands that Ireland should be kept for the Irish. He failed to mention that the conference was being organized by a man from England and that the previous speaker was an American living in Ireland. (Power agreed to answer questions from WIRED but did not respond after the questions were put to him.)

At this point, the event was briefly disrupted by a small protest outside by two local activists who highlighted the fact that Attwood had been advocating a toxic bleach solution to his followers. Power and fellow far-right activist Philip Dwyer confronted the two protesters and questioned if they were trying to get Attwood killed, just like Kirk. Dwyer declined to answer WIRED's questions about his comments but called this reporter a “communist left-wing radical.”

Back inside, Attwood laughed off the protesters, with one later speaker calling them “clones.”

Finally, after mystic Honey C Golden had informed everyone that “The Matrix was a reality show” and that she doesn't “really believe in time,” it was time for Lewis Herms, a fringe candidate for California governor, to take the stage.

Herms, who became popular through his Screw Big Gov platform online, is running as an independent conservative and is one of almost 70 people who have filed statements of interest in being governor of California. Calling himself an “anti-politician,” Herms slammed the GOP for not talking about “child trafficking,” “election fraud,” or the influence of “Big Pharma.”

While Herms has decided not to employ a campaign manager—because it would not be authentic—he did claim that he is working with some other people.

“I'm very proud to say a lot of RFK Jr.'s team is already working with us,” Herms said. “And they already label our team Super MAHA because we're looking for different modalities that we can bring back to California and bring to a whole other level than he's even doing it right now.”

Herms and Kennedy did not respond to requests for comment.

Herms received a standing ovation at the end of his nearly 45-minute speech despite the fact that most people were, at this point, very cold. But even though it was now dark outside, there was still time for one more speaker—Janine Morigeau, a Canadian tarot card reader.

Just as the day had begun with the name of Kirk being invoked, so it ended. “Is Charlie Kirk really dead?” an audience member asked, with the rest of the crowd reacting excitedly. Morigeau proceeded to pull half a dozen different cards and very quickly concluded that the person seen on camera being shot was not actually Kirk at all.

“Whatever they were doing there was likely a white hat op, because it's to the benefit of humanity,” Morigeau said before adding mysteriously: “I don't know if even the real Charlie Kirk was who we thought he was.”

BANGOR -- The city of Bangor certainly has no shortage of history, but it also has no shortage of spooky stories. The Bangor Historical Society merges both of those in their ghostly walking tours every October.

Tour host and historical society manager Matt Bishop has been hosting these spooky strolls for well over a decade every October. Thursday was the first one of 2025.

Bishop says he hasn't seen a spirit in his time in Bangor yet, but he says leading these journeys is a great way to educate locals on both the history and the haunts.

"You just have the energies of the areas and especially when you hear what happened there, you kind of get the hair to stand on the back of your neck a little bit, and those energies still do speak to us today," shared Bishop. "These tours are really one of those things we look forward to every year...really seeing the city at a beautiful time of year and incorporating the spooky aspects."

To find out more of Bangor's paranormal past, watch above! To book your own tour or learn more, contact the Bangor Historical Society.

Penn's Sung Robotics Lab is working with NASA to lead an initiative investigating how robots can explore and navigate extraterrestrial environments.


The project, titled “Temporarily, Robots Unite to Surmount Sandy Entrapments, then Separate," is led by School of Engineering and Applied Sciences researchers from the General Robotics, Automation, Sensing & Perception Lab in partnership with NASA and researchers from other universities. Their research centers around a multi-robot system that allows the robots to physically connect, pulling and pushing each other to overcome environmental hazards.
		

Engineering professor and principal lead Cynthia Sung said that a goal of the project is to create a robot that can successfully interact with lunar surfaces.


“We aim to design systems that perform real-world tasks as best as possible,” Sung told Penn Engineering Today. “To do this, we have to build the complexity of the environment into the model as well as find ways where our work in soft robotics' interactions applies to hard robots traversing soft, sandy terrain.”

Towards this end, researchers combined wheeled rovers and legged robots to maximize maneuverability and stability.


“By relying on multiple individual robots instead of one, we create a more robust system aligned with NASA's current robotic infrastructure,” Sung added. “If one robot fails, the system can still function. That wouldn't be the case if we just designed one robot that could do all the jobs needed.”
	

The project's website explains that a priority is to have “heterogeneous teams of ground robots” so that “each robot interacts differently with the terrain, offering unique capabilities in team operations.” With such a diverse team of robots, the robots can divide tastes and explore difficult environments, making lunar and Martian missions more feasible.


The research follows a $2 million grant from NASA in December 2023 to support the project.


In August, the researchers tested the new multi-robot system at the White Sands National Park in New Mexico, where they were able to reproduce similar conditions to the moon and Mars.

During their field testing, researchers observed that the robots connected together and were able to climb up about 2.5 meters up the sand dunes. The team described this as a “big success” as it showed how the multi-robot systems could handle environments currently off-limits to single rovers.  


The team is scheduled to present the system at the NASA Ames Research Center in early 2026. According to Sung, the limited room provided to the robots to maneuver will make the demonstration extra challenging.


“We're a little nervous, sure,” project researcher and sixth-year Engineering Ph.D. candidate Shivangi Misra said to Penn Engineering Today. “With every test we run, there is something to improve in the hardware [and] the software. But we've done what feels like the hard part, and we think we're in pretty good shape for what comes next.”
