                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new national study reveals that hospitals providing surgical care have closed at a significantly higher rate than new ones have opened, with closures disproportionately concentrated in communities with high levels of poverty and social vulnerability. The study highlights a growing disparity in access to surgical care. Researchers used American Hospital Association data to track hospitals performing at least 100 operations per year in 2010 and 2020. Between hospital openings and closures, they found a net decrease of 298 surgical hospitals nationwide. We were surprised by just how big of a number it was. It is pretty startling to see such a drastic drop without adequate replacement volume, and it's concerning for patient access to care." Jesse E. Passman, MD, MPH, MSHP, lead author, general surgery resident at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Targeted closures: Newly closed hospitals were disproportionately located in census tracts with lower median incomes and higher social vulnerability scores than areas with hospitals that opened or remained active. These areas were more than twice as likely to be highly socially vulnerable. Systemic strain: Study authors warn that closures create a "huge influx of patients to surrounding hospitals, straining the emergency departments and surgical departments." Having that information is essential to their ongoing health care." The reasons for closure, while not directly studied, are likely economic, related to challenges in sustaining smaller hospitals and safety-net institutions that serve a high proportion of patients on government insurance, authors note. The study underscores several critical consequences of hospital closures: Loss of medical history: Patients can permanently lose access to their medical records, leading to costly and dangerous duplicative testing, re-establishment of medical history, and a lack of crucial health information for new providers. Strain on surrounding systems: Remaining hospitals must absorb a sudden influx of new patients without established histories, stretching resources thin. Patients may forgo care: The increased burden of travel and finding new providers can cause some patients to delay or completely avoid seeking necessary medical or surgical care, allowing conditions to worsen.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The first successful human transplant of a kidney converted from blood type A to universal type O used special enzymes developed at the University of British Columbia to help prevent a mismatch and rejection of the organ. Published today in Nature Biomedical Engineering, the achievement marks a major step toward helping thousands of patients get kidney transplants sooner. In a first-in-human experiment, the enzyme-converted kidney was transplanted into a brain-dead recipient with consent from the family, allowing researchers to observe the immune response without risking a life. For two days, the kidney functioned without signs of hyperacute rejection, the rapid immune reaction that can destroy an incompatible organ within minutes. "This is the first time we've seen this play out in a human model," said Dr. Stephen Withers, UBC professor emeritus of chemistry who co-led the enzyme development. "It gives us invaluable insight into how to improve long-term outcomes." In the early 2010s, Dr. Withers and colleague Dr. Jayachandran Kizhakkedathu, a UBC professor in the department of pathology and laboratory medicine and the Centre for Blood Research, were focused on making universal donor blood by stripping away the sugars that define blood types. Those same sugars, or antigens, coat organ blood vessels. If a recipient's immune system detects the wrong antigen, it attacks. As a result, type-O patients typically wait two to four years longer, and many die waiting. Traditional methods for overcoming blood-type incompatibility in transplants require days of intensive treatment to strip antibodies and suppress a recipient's immune system-and require organs from living donors. This new approach changes the organ rather than the patient, meaning transplants could be performed faster, with fewer complications, and for the first time could unlock the use of blood-type mismatched organs from deceased donors-when every hour can determine whether a patient lives or dies. The next challenge was applying this to whole organs, achieved in 2022 when a Toronto team showed lungs could be converted. After successful tests on blood, then lungs and kidneys (with the University of Cambridge) outside the body, the question remained: Could an enzyme-converted organ survive inside a human immune system? The answer came in late 2023 on an overseas trip for Dr. Kizhakkedathu. "Our collaborators showed me their data where, using our enzymes, they had converted a human kidney and transplanted it into a brain-dead recipient. He stayed up late to call Dr. Withers first thing in the B.C. Blood-type antigens act like nametags on cells, and the UBC enzymes act as molecular scissors, snipping off the 'nametag' that marks type A and revealing type O beneath. Dr. Stephen Withers, UBC professor emeritus of chemistry Regulatory approval for clinical trials is the next hurdle, and the partner UBC spin-off company Avivo Biomedical will lead development of these enzymes for transplant application and to enable the creation of universal donor blood on demand for transfusion medicine. "This is what it looks like when years of basic science finally connect to patient care," said Dr. Withers. "Seeing our discoveries edge closer to real-world impact is what keeps us pushing forward." Enzyme-converted O kidneys allow ABO-incompatible transplantation without hyperacute rejection in a human decedent model.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at McMaster University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have made two scientific breakthroughs at once: they not only discovered a brand-new antibiotic that targets inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), but also successfully used a new type of AI to predict exactly how the drug works. To their knowledge, this a global first for the AI. Detailed on October 3, 2025 in the journal Nature Microbiology, the discovery unveils a promising new treatment option for millions of people affected by Crohn's disease and other related conditions, while also showcasing important new applications for AI in drug discovery research. "This work shows that we're still just scratching the surface as far as AI-guided drug discovery goes," says Jon Stokes, an assistant professor in McMaster's Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences and principal investigator on the new study. The development of our new drug, which is designed to target IBD, has been fast-tracked thanks to the collaboration between humans and generative AI." Jon Stokes, Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, McMaster University Most antibiotics used in clinics today are "broad-spectrum" drugs, meaning they wipe out good bacteria in addition to those that cause disease - "they're nukes," Stokes explains. This can create opportunities for invasive and drug-resistant species of bacteria, like E. coli, to move in and colonize the intestines, which can exacerbate conditions like Crohn's. But enterololin, the new antibiotic discovered at McMaster, is a "narrow-spectrum" drug, meaning it spares the microbiome and attacks only a specific group of disease-causing bugs - in this case, a family of bacteria called Enterobacteriaceae, which happens to include E. coli. "This new drug is a really promising treatment candidate for the millions of patients living with IBD," Stokes says. "We currently have no cure for these conditions, so developing something that might meaningfully alleviate symptoms could help people experience a much higher quality of life." To date, AI has been leveraged as a tool for predicting which molecules might have therapeutic potential, but this study used it to describe what researchers call "mechanism of action" (MOA) - or how drugs attack disease. "AI has expedited the rate at which we can explore chemical space for new drug candidates, but, until now, it has done little to alleviate a major bottleneck in drug development, which is understanding what these new drug candidates actually do," explains Stokes. They help scientists confirm safety, optimize dosage, make modifications to improve efficacy, and sometimes even uncover entirely new drug targets. They also help regulators determine whether or not a given drug candidate is suitable for use in humans. Stokes says a thorough MOA study can take up to two years and cost around $2 million; however, using AI, his group did enterololin's in just six months and for just $60,000. Indeed, after his lab's discovery of the new antibiotic, Stokes connected with colleagues at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL) to see if any of their emerging machine learning platforms could help fast-track his upcoming MOA studies. In just 100 seconds, he was given a prediction: his new drug attacked a microscopic protein complex called LolCDE, which is essential to the survival of certain bacteria. "A lot of AI use in drug discovery has been about searching chemical space, identifying new molecules that might be active," says Regina Barzilay, a professor in MIT's School of Engineering and the developer of DiffDock, the AI model that made the prediction. "What we're showing here is that AI can also provide mechanistic explanations, which are critical for moving a molecule through the development pipeline." Barzilay was recently listed among Time Magazine's most influential people in AI. He would still have to conduct traditional MOA studies in the lab. "Currently, we can't just assume that these AI models are totally right, but the notion that it could be right took the guesswork out of our next steps," explains Stokes, a member of the Michael G. DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research at McMaster. And so his team, led in large part by McMaster graduate student Denise Catacutan, began investigating enterololin's MOA, using MIT's prediction as a starting point. Within just a few months, it became clear that the AI was in fact right. "Doing it this way shaved a year-and-a-half off of our normal timeline." "Drug resistance and our lack of new drugs is a leaky faucet," he says. The pathway to patients Stokes' spin-out company, Stoked Bio, has already licensed enterololin from McMaster and is currently optimizing it for human use. "We are proud to partner with the university on translating this breakthrough into real therapies for patients." If all goes well, Stokes says that the new drug will be ready for human trials within three years - a timeline his research team is eager to meet. "Working on something translational like this is surreal," says Catacutan. Catacutan, D. B., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A first-of-its-kind study from Houston Methodist found that adipose-derived extracellular vesicles, tiny cell-to-cell messengers in the body, can signal the buildup of amyloid-β plaque in obese individuals. These plaques are a key feature of Alzheimer's disease. The study, "Decoding Adipose–Brain Crosstalk: Distinct Lipid Cargo in Human Adipose-Derived Extracellular Vesicles Modulates Amyloid Aggregation in Alzheimer's Disease," published today in Alzheimer's & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association. Alongside Wong, Li Yang, Ph.D., a research associate at Houston Methodist, and Jianting Sheng, Ph.D., an assistant research professor of computational biology and mathematics in radiology at the Houston Methodist Academic Institute, provided leadership in experimental design and cross-institution coordination. As recent studies have underscored, obesity is now recognized as the top modifiable risk factor for dementia in the United States." Stephen Wong, Study Corresponding Author and Director, T. T. & W. F. Chao Center for BRAIN, Houston Methodist The researchers found that the lipid cargo of these cell messengers differs between people with obesity and lean individuals, and that the presence and levels of specific lipids that differed between the groups changed how quickly amyloid-β clumped together in laboratory models. Using mouse models and patient body fat samples, the researchers examined the vesicles, which are tiny, membrane-bound particles that travel throughout the body and act as messengers involved in cell-to-cell communication. These minuscule communicators are also capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier. Targeting these tiny cell messengers and disrupting their communication, which leads to plaque formation, may help reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease in people with obesity. The researchers said future work should focus on how drug therapy could stop or slow the build-up of Alzheimer's-related toxic proteins (such as amyloid-β) in at-risk individuals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are an estimated 1800 retail health clinics in 44 states that provide basic services on a walk-in or limited appointment basis. “Many of the patients we see at MinuteClinic either don't have a primary care provider or have not seen one in years,” said Angela Patterson, DNP, FNP-BC, NEA-BC, FAANP, enterprise chief nurse officer, vice president, and chief nurse practitioner (NP) officer, Retail Health for CVS Health. For example, the Medscape RN/LPN Job Market Report 2025 found that Offering convenient, more affordable access to care in underserved areas is among the reasons that visits to retail clinics increased 200% in a 5-year period, outpacing the use of urgent care clinics and emergency departments. “It reflects a change and shift in our society,” Mehrotra told Medscape Medical News. “Where you can get groceries 24/7 [and] banking 24/7…people are expecting the ability to get care at any time and outside an emergency department.” NPs and physician assistants (PAs) are often the ones providing care in retail clinics. Retail clinics have expanded the number of career opportunities for NPs and can have a positive impact in developing NP careers, according to the American Nurses Association. Treating patients in retail clinics offers a predictable schedule free of overnight shifts, better work-life balance, and greater autonomy. While NPs might appreciate predictable schedules, working autonomously to treat minor illnesses and injuries, and providing care in a retail clinic, the model is not without its downsides. Retail health clinics are struggling with staffing shortages, rising business costs, administrative burdens, and reimbursement challenges. In 2023, Walgreens closed 60 of its retail clinics and Walmart followed suit, closing all 51 Walmart Health centers across five states in 2024, leading to nurses' job losses. CVS Health also announced plans to lay off 2900 employees in 2024. “Now we're in this weird space where it's pretty much just one retailer…and almost all retail clinics are CVS MinuteClinic.” MinuteClinic expanded its services to include a primary care model for adults in 12 states and the District of Columbia. Patterson says the model is seeing strong primary care patient enrollment as a result of same day access, extended evening and weekend hours, and virtual care options that are often absent from traditional primary care practices. The American Medical Association expressed concerns that retail clinics resulted in lost opportunities for preventive care. The same autonomy that attracts NPs to retail clinics can also be a drawback. NPs also benefit from collaborating with care teams that include a population health coordinator who manages care between appointments and manages referrals and collaborating physicians who provide oversight of in-clinic teams, she added. Mehrotra believes that the explosion of telehealth options could also be to blame. One survey found that retail clinic utilization decreased 12% while telehealth visits increased 3% nationwide but more than three quarters of NPs still believe that retail health clinics are an important part of the health system. “The question that comes up in that context is whether there's an even more convenient option for patients and whether retail clinics really have long-term legs.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Convatec, a global leader in medical products and technologies, today announces plans to invest more than $1 billion over the next decade to accelerate its research and development (R&D) ambitions worldwide. This global, multi-year planned investment marks a significant milestone in Convatec's mission to deliver breakthrough healthcare solutions and underlines its long-standing commitment to both the United States and the United Kingdom as cornerstones of its global growth strategy. As part of this plan, Convatec will invest $600 m over the next ten years in R&D in the US, underlining the company's long-term commitment to its most significant market globally. The plans include a significant expansion of its world-class R&D facilities in Boston, United States, by end 2025 – increasing capacity by 50 % and further enhancing lab, testing and collaboration space. The new facility will be one of the largest in Convatec's global network of Technology & Innovation Centres, with the potential to provide common or shared R&D capabilities and competences across all four of Convatec's categories: Advanced Wound Care, Ostomy Care, Continence Care, and Infusion Care. It will also house cutting-edge analytical R&D capabilities, regulatory functions, and digital health innovation, positioning Convatec at the forefront of medical technology development. Convatec has a proud heritage of innovation that has transformed patient care and improved lives for millions of people worldwide. The company invests over $100 million annually in R&D —approximately 5 % of its revenue – which has delivered its strongest ever pipeline of new products designed to address unmet needs in chronic care. In addition to the major US and UK planned investments, Convatec will sustain investment in other key European locations, supporting its global network of Technology & Innovation Centres in Denmark and Slovakia and onsite R&D teams in Mexico and the Dominican Republic, as well as its global manufacturing network. The plans to enhance Convatec's R&D footprint in the US and UK follows a comprehensive review of its global growth ambitions. Since 1996, Convatec's Deeside site has served as a major center for R&D alongside its manufacturing operations. The company has now identified Manchester as the ideal location for its new, enlarged UK facility, given its vibrant life sciences ecosystem, which includes leading universities, hospitals, and research institutions. The new Manchester R&D hub will be home for around 200 highly skilled colleagues, largely transferring from Convatec's existing Deeside R&D site, with plans for further growth in the years ahead. Convatec's manufacturing site in Deeside, North Wales, will remain a cornerstone of its global operations and is unaffected by this change, with around 400 employees continuing to be based there after the move completes in 2027. Today's announcement marks an exciting moment in Convatec's commitment to pioneering trusted medical solutions to improve the lives we touch. Our plans to invest more than $1 billion – anchored by major expansion plans in both the United States and the United Kingdom – demonstrates our unwavering commitment to advancing healthcare innovation for people living with chronic conditions around the world.” Dr. Divakar Ramakrishnan, Chief Technology Officer and Head of Research & Development at Convatec, said: “The significant expansion of our R&D capabilities in Boston and plans to establish a new flagship center in Manchester are investments in the talent, technology, and infrastructure needed to accelerate innovation in pioneering trusted chronic care solutions. The US expansion is expected to be completed by end 2025, and the new Manchester hub is expected to be operational by 2027, with a phased transition to ensure minimal disruption to ongoing projects and close collaboration with Convatec's wider global network of Technology & Innovation Centres. When fully operational, these flagship sites in Boston and Manchester will be at the heart of Convatec's global innovation network, which includes major sites in the UK, US, Denmark, and Slovakia. Both sites will play crucial roles in Convatec's R&D strategy along with other centers to drive innovation across Convatec's business worldwide.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 700 million people worldwide and is caused by genetic and environmental factors, as well as existing medical conditions. Known genetic risk factors for CKD include mutations in a gene called APOL1. These are rare in most populations, but two risk variants are present in as much as 13 percent of people of West African origin, and another 38% possess one copy (carriers). To gain a better understanding of AMKD, Siebe Spijker and his team from the University of Leiden, Netherlands, generated stem cells from skin biopsies of AMKD patients and turned them into microscopic structures known as kidney organoids, which can model aspects of human kidney function. In some of these organoids, the APOL1 mutations were corrected by genetic engineering. The research was published today in Stem Cell Reports. Through a panel of lab-based tests, the researchers found that APOL1 mutations impair the proper function of mitochondria, which are required for respiration and energy production, in the kidney. This finding could explain why inflammation in the body, e.g., from viral infections or autoimmune disease, often triggers the onset of AMKD in patients. We anticipate that this human kidney organoid model will advance our understanding of AMKD and accelerate drug discovery, particularly given that APOL1 is not endogenously expressed in rodents." This research shows that mutant APOL1 affects mitochondrial function in podocytes and may open up avenues for designing targeted treatments for patients with AMKD. Song, H., et al. (2025) APOL1 risk variants induce metabolic reprogramming of podocytes in patient-derived kidney organoids.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Patients undergoing coronary angiography often experience anxiety both before and during the procedure, often treated by the administration of anti-anxiety medications. A new analysis being presented at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) Middle East 2025 Together with 16th Emirates Cardiac Society Conference found virtual reality (VR) effectively reduced anxiety during the procedure and had more stable vital signs than patients receiving standard care. Virtual reality offers an innovative solution to manage and reduce the anxiety of patients undergoing an interventional cardiovascular procedure, like coronary angiography, that they are typically awake during." Coronary angiography is part of a group of cardiac tests known as cardiac catheterization, which utilizes catheters to determine blockages and/or place stents in the vessels of the heart. Virtual reality is a computer simulation that enables a person to interact with computer-generated 3-D visuals or other sensory environments. Researchers analyzed data from five randomized controlled trials comprising 451 patients comparing VR to standard of care in patients undergoing coronary angiography. Some of the VR scenarios used included nature scenes like waterfalls, mountains and valleys, designed to induce a state of relaxation that may reduce anxiety and stabilize vital signs in these patients, Alnomani said. VR during coronary angiography was found to be superior to the standard of care in reducing anxiety and was associated with significantly lower changes in heart rate and blood pressure. Limitations of the study include its retrospective nature. Larger, randomized controlled trials are needed in the future to determine the broad use of VR in improving care of patients undergoing coronary angiography and other cardiovascular interventions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When University of Texas at Arlington researcher Paul J. Fadel and his colleagues launched a study on vascular health in people with chronic kidney disease, they expected to better understand a long-standing belief. For years, scientists have pointed to a blood marker called ADMA-asymmetric dimethylarginine-as a warning sign for vascular problems. Instead, another blood marker, SDMA-symmetric dimethylarginine-long considered mostly inactive, showed a stronger connection to vascular health than ADMA. "The background premise of the study is that people with chronic kidney disease do not die from their kidney problems. "We wanted to better understand that connection by examining blood vessel function." While confirming that SDMA is strongly related to kidney function, the study also revealed an unexpected twist-that it may flag early vascular problems more effectively than ADMA in people with chronic kidney disease. Neither marker is a perfect predictor, Fadel said, but the discovery could help shape how doctors track and treat patients. Focusing on individuals with moderate kidney disease, the study found that higher SDMA levels-but not ADMA-correlated with weaker blood vessel function. In plain terms, SDMA may help identify at-risk patients earlier, potentially before dialysis becomes necessary. We focused on patients with moderate chronic kidney disease, primarily stage 3, because intervention is still possible to offset the cardiovascular problems that arise with further disease progression and being put on dialysis." Paul J. Fadel, University of Texas at Arlington This research suggests that measuring SDMA levels may provide a better approach to monitoring vascular function in patients with kidney disease than relying on ADMA. Fadel served as a lead investigator on the project.
