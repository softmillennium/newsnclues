                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Throughout more than 20 seasons on the ATP Tour, Rafael Nadal forged a legendary career that included countless titles, records and landmark achievements. The Spaniard gave a speech to the assembly hall in a ceremony that was attended by his wife Mery Perello, his parents Sebastian and Ana Maria, and his sister Maribel. “As you all know, I did not follow a traditional academic education like most of you here; my education was different. Therefore, this recognition is not only a privilege for me, it is also a demonstration of respect for sport and what it represents to society.” 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings set himself apart not only because of his competitive nature and ability to enjoy so much success throughout his professional career, but also because of his exemplary behaviour on and off the court. “Ever since I was a boy, sport has been my own college and, in some ways, my own university. What I learned on the courts has always been with me, both in tennis and away from it. Sport taught me the value of discipline. Continuing with the theme of education, Nadal spoke of a lesson he learned when he was a boy: “In 2002, when I was still a teenager, I was very excited about a particular goal; to play in the junior Roland Garros tournament for the first time. At the time, I already had some ATP points, I'd played in international tournaments and I thought that event was a great chance to compete on one of the most emblematic stages in my sport. Imagine a 15-year-old's excitement at playing in Paris. “However, my parents told me I could not play, because it was during exam season. For me, at 15, it was very difficult to understand. Despite my disappointment, my parents were not to be moved and in the end, I didn't play in the tournament. With time, I learned that the decision was a great lesson and now I thank them because they helped me finish my compulsory education and they taught me that no goal comes before values and education.” Editor's Note: This story was translated from ATPTour.com/es.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz's only true competitor recognizes the danger in complacency.ByPeter BodoPublished Oct 03, 2025 copy_link Jannik Sinner may have failed to deliver on the expectations of many, including his own, in the recent US Open final. But in his post-final press briefing, he delivered a startlingly transparent—and completely unexpected—assessment of his shortcomings.This is something Grand Slam champions simply do not do when relegated to the co-pilot seat. And it speaks to the evolution of the game.“I was very predictable today,” Sinner said, teeing up what would develop into a monologue of sorts—one that seemed out of character for the shy, 24-year-old, already four-time major champion. That's also his style of how he plays.

That's also his style of how he plays. It was an accurate assessment, the meat of which we'll take a closer look at later. But contrast the essence of those words with one of the most famous pronouncements in tennis history, made by Jimmy Connors in 1978 after he lost his second consecutive Wimbledon final to nemesis Bjorn Borg: “I'll follow him to the ends of the earth,” Connors declared, in a headline generating promise.But meanwhile, Connors spurned questions about the glaring hole in his game, his weak forehand approach shot. You want to go out and exchange forehands with me, he snarled at told one reporter.One thing is, when the scorelines of [previous] matches are comfortable but you always do the same things [it's dangerous]. But consider gentleman Roger Federer's bland reaction in 2008, when Rafael Nadal demolished him for the third Roland Garros final, allowing the world No. 1 just four games in three sets: “I was hoping for a better outcome, no doubt, you know,” Federer said. “But Rafa played well today, made it hard for me, and, yeah, was better.”Asked to analyze the match, Federer replied, “Look, it doesn't matter now what happened, you know. I wish it was a different outcome.”Granted, besting Nadal on Parisian clay has probably been the toughest assignment in tennis. But Federer was just following the conventional wisdom to avoid the confession of a weakness at all costs, or a need to make changes.

In the US Open final, Sinner's predictability was accompanied by atypical inconsistency. He made 28 unforced errors, four more than Alcaraz with his high-risk game. It demands greater watchfulness, flexibility and a constant willingness to make tweaks and changes—even from those at the pinnacle of the sport. This is why the upcoming clashes between Sinner and Alcaraz in 2026 are so promising. He went on to provide a laundry list of things he did not do during his matches—attacking the net, employing slice and drop shots—which left him unprepared to deal with the dazzling variety Alcaraz used to yank Sinner out of his comfort zone. No mean feat, that.Sinner said that he's willing to take some losses as he tries to round out his game and expand his palette. It's partly because, in addition to his Alcaraz problem (their latest clash saw the Spaniard supplant the Italian for No. He said: “One thing is, when the scorelines of [previous] matches are comfortable but you always do the same things [it's dangerous].

He made 28 unforced errors, four more than Alcaraz with his high-risk game. Yet just weeks earlier at Wimbledon, Sinner had an edge in almost every category.The larger issue at play here is how each man wins his points.According to metrics developed by TennisViz in partnership with Tennis Data Innovations (TDI) specifically for ATP broadcasts, Sinner leads the ATP Tour in the “Core Shots” category, which measures standard topspin strokes hit through an opponent's baseline. Alcaraz doesn't even appear in the Top 10 on that list. It's because he doesn't hit enough coast-to-coast groundstrokes.🖥️📲Stream Sinner's match with Altmaier in Shanghai LIVE, Saturday, October 4, at 6:30 a.m. ETCore Shots is but one component in a larger metric and data set called “Shot Variety,” which measures the extent to which a player mixes up tactics—drop shots, volleys, topspin angles, slice. The co-leaders in the category are Daniel Evans and Alexander Bublik, both players hitting roughly 47 percent of their shots with variation.The data providers do not publish a Shot Variety ranking, or stats for all individuals (their data is proprietary), but an AI trawl by ChatGPT suggests Alcaraz comes out at roughly 30 percent (25–35%) on the variety scale, notably above the tour average, while Sinner's variety count works out to roughly 20 percent (18-22%) of his shots. That's right around the tour average.It's also legitimate to ask if Sinner isn't just overreacting to his recent Grand Slam loss: Did he expect to beat Alcaraz with those stats that Sunday afternoon?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After his opening-round win against Marin Cilic at the Rolex Paris Masters on Friday night, Djokovic won the crowd all over again. He had fans buzzing when he spoke to them in Chinese and signed the camera lens with a local character. “It's always a pleasure to play in front of such passionate fans. People have been giving me lots of love and support over the years, so I try to give them back with good tennis, and also a basic knowledge of Chinese language with a few phrases. “It was amazing to see the packed house tonight. It's one of the most beautiful stadiums, and I totally enjoy myself.” That mutual affection has been building for more than a decade. Djokovic is this week making his 11th appearance in Shanghai, where he has lifted the trophy a record four times. He even left his mark in 2008, winning the Nitto ATP Finals (then the Masters Tennis Cup) during its Shanghai chapter. This particular reunion, however, came with an extra challenge: the humidity. Djokovic found himself sweating through grips faster than usual, resorting to sawdust for traction. I don't recall the weather being so humid in China,” Djokovic said. The laundry bills will be quite high this week, but that's okay.” The German has come through four matches, including qualifying, and will aim to unload his heavy hitting on Djokovic.

The Serbian saved all four break points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats, and hit 10 aces to Cilic's six. I aced him more than he aced me, which is not very common when you play somebody like Marin,” said Djokovic. “I dug myself out of trouble with the serve and some good shots.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Separated by 11 years, Jessica Pegula and Linda Noskova meet in Beijing's final four. We make the case for both players. Separated by 11 years, they come together from opposite sides of two traditional powers in women's tennis. Jessica Pegula, at 31, is one of three Americans to reach the semifinals at this China Open -- and the second oldest ever. “I've been asked this question a lot in the past two years, because there's a lot of us doing really, really well,” the No. “It's definitely tough to have so many players from Czechia play before me -- there's a lot of us,” Noskova said. Later, Pegula converted her third match point, coming back to defeat No. ET) will be their third meeting this year. Pegula will be the first to tell you that these slow courts in Beijing do not play to her strengths. That said, she's found a way to survive and advance. After failing to convert six set points in the opening frame, she duplicated that result to close out Navarro. Pegula's done it by making a series of small adjustments. “Honestly, with me this week, I've been trying to slow things down,” Pegula said after defeating Navarro. “It sounds counterintuitive, but actually do less. And that kind of helps me find my flow a little bit, especially in these slow conditions that maybe doesn't favor me as much. “I was just telling myself, ‘Don't overdo the strategy.' That allowed me to relax a little bit.” Thinking without overthinking has allowed Pegula to win 66 three-set matches since the turn of the century -- only Aryna Sabalenka  (68) has won more in that span. This is relevant because three of the five sets Pegula has played against Noskova have required seven games to win -- a sign that this one might go the distance. “It's tough playing someone like that because sometimes I feel like you have to wait for your chance and if you do get a chance and you don't execute it can kind of slip away. “I'm interested to see how it goes with the conditions.” This is a milestone moment for Noskova -- and she knows it. “I was on the edge of the Top 30, Top 35, trying to find my place,” Noskova said of her play earlier this year. “I think it was a couple of months ago when I thought, ‘It would be nice to break into the Top 20 by the end of the year. She's already collected 390 ranking points here and a semifinal victory would run that total to 650 points, enough to crack the Top 20 next week. Noskova, who has won four straight matches for the first time since the Prague Open back in July, is playing with confidence. 2 player for the Czech Republic, not far behind Karolina Muchova and ahead of major champions Barbora Krejcikova and Marketa Vondrousova. Against Pegula, she needs to take care of her hefty serve and limit the double faults that sometimes creep into her game. Noskova remembers the last time they played, in Bad Homburg. “That was tough match for me,” she said. This [the win over Kartal] was my best match here so far. Here's another compelling reason to like Noskova: After promising results in Abu Dhabi (3-1), Doha (2-1), Dubai (3-1) and now Beijing (4-0), no woman -- not even Iga Swiatek -- has compiled more than her 12 match wins in Asia. Separated by 11 years, Jessica Pegula and Linda Noskova meet in Beijing's final four. We make the case for both players.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jessica Pegula is through to the China Open semifinals for the first time in her career after coming from behind to defeat fellow American Emma Navarro 6-7 (2), 6-2, 6-1 in just over two hours on Friday in Beijing. She will face Linda Noskova for a spot in the final. Jessica Pegula could have unraveled Friday in Beijing after what was, for all intents and purposes, a first-set collapse in her quarterfinal match against fellow American Emma Navarro. 5 seed twice served for the set and held six set points, but Navarro saved them all and took the opener in a tiebreak. “I told myself not to get too frustrated,” Pegula said after the match. That kind of allowed me to play more free.” She closed out the second set drama-free, backed by an almost untouchable serve. From that point on, Pegula held serve in every game. She broke for a 3-1 lead, just as she did in the set prior and proceeded to serve out the match. Navarro applied a touch of late pressure, earning three break points in the following game and saving two match points, but Pegula held firm to complete the comeback. Pegula and Noskova have met twice this year, splitting the head-to-head in two tightly contested matches. Coincidentally, she entered that match on the heels of a three-set quarterfinal win over none other than Emma Navarro. The winner this time around will advance to face either Coco Gauff or Amanda Anisimova for the China Open title. But first, enjoy these fast facts from Pegula's comeback win: Jessica Pegula is through to the China Open semifinals for the first time in her career after coming from behind to defeat fellow American Emma Navarro 6-7 (2), 6-2, 6-1 in just over two hours on Friday in Beijing. She will face Linda Noskova for a spot in the final.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From defending champion Coco Gauff to resurgent Madison Keys and first-time qualifier Amanda Anisimova, the trio's collective rise sets the stage for an American showcase at the season's grand finale. Three Americans navigated vastly different paths, but secured their invitations to the ultimate destination. This week at the China Open, Coco Gauff, Madison Keys and Amanda Anisimova qualified for the PIF WTA Finals in Riyadh. They are three competitors at three stages of their careers, staging a red-white-and-blue revival, united by the thread of uncommon resilience. And so, the singles field in Riyadh is shaping up. We now have five of the eight competitors, after No. Gauff is into the semifinals and has won 14 of her 15 matches at the China Open, something no other woman has done in the more than two decades of this event. A berth in Riyadh is the ultimate payoff after an up-and-down year for Gauff. The grass season did not go as well. Gauff lost her only two matches, in Berlin and at Wimbledon, and when she transitioned to the North American hard-court season double faults became an issue. Gauff turned to mechanics expert Gavin MacMillan, who solved Aryna Sabalenka's serving woes. After winning her first three matches at the US Open, Gauff fell in the fourth round to Naomi Osaka. A year ago, Gauff took the title in Beijing and, including Wuhan, wound up winning nine of 10 matches to enter the WTA Finals in peak form. After losing her opening match in Riyadh, Gauff defeated four Top 10 players, including No. The way she's playing, it could be a scenario that repeats itself. Gauff has a chance to go back-to-back at the WTA Finals since Serena Williams more than a decade ago. She becomes the fourth singles player lined up for Riyadh, due to her breakthrough win at the Australian Open. Keys withdrew from Beijing and Wuhan with an injury. Back in January, on the cusp of her 30th birthday, Keys won her first Grand Slam singles title in Melbourne. After years of stressing over her lack of a Grand Slam title, Keys finally came to understand that, even in the context of professional tennis, she'd produced an extraordinary career. And that realization freed her to take the next step. The two players she lost to -- Simona Halep and Angelique Kerber -- have both retired. But Keys has persevered and contemplates a second year-end challenge. At the BNP Paribas Open in March, Keys acknowledged that the win in Australia heightened her personal expectations but cautioned restraint. “It's really important for me and for my team to remember how we got there and what we were doing,” she said. “And I think kind of going back to that, and staying really grounded in that is going to be really important. “I think the balance of being honest with my expectations rising, but also knowing that I don't think anyone really thrives when you have such a dramatic mind shift so quickly after success.” After a sizzling, career-best run this summer, Anisimova has been severely tested in Beijing. She weathered a tiebreak in the third round against Zhang Shuai that required 24 points, then came back from down a set to defeat both Karolina Muchova and Jasmine Paolini. It was a display of patience under pressure that Anisimova seems to have increasingly mastered this year. The US Open offered a chance for revenge and Anisimova took it with gusto, throwing down a 6-4, 6-3 win over Swiatek in the quarterfinals and following up with semifinal success over Naomi Osaka. She pushed Sabalenka to a second-set tiebreak before falling in the final. “Today I really came out there with, like, not an ounce of fear,” Anisimova said after beating Swiatek. “I feel like I really made a point to myself and also maybe to other people that, like, if you really put a positive mindset out there or just try and work through things, then you can have a positive outcome.” From defending champion Coco Gauff to resurgent Madison Keys and first-time qualifier Amanda Anisimova, the trio's collective rise sets the stage for an American showcase at the season's grand finale.</p>

Djokovic reached the semifinals of all four major tournaments in 2025 but was unable to add to his already-considerable title haul after injury forced him to retire at the Australian Open followed by losses to Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner.Spurred on by the warm crowd reception on Arthur Ashe Stadium, the former world No. 1 showed no signs of hanging up his racquets and hit the ground running this week in Shanghai, where he reached the final in 2024. "The amount of support I've been getting since that year has been incredible in China, both Beijing and Shanghai," Djokovic said in his pre-tournament press conference. "I just love coming back and performing in front of the crowd that always gives me great energy, great vibes. Every practice session it feels like playing a match, honestly, with the amount of people that is there screaming and really willing to show their support and show their love and passion for what I do. 1 showed no signs of hanging up his racquets and hit the ground running this week in Shanghai, where he reached the final in 2024.

A clean stat sheet saw Djokovic end the match with 21 winners to just 15 unforced errors.Up next for the four-time Shanghai champion will be German qualifier Yannick Hanfmann, who twice rallied from a set down to score back-to-back victories over Lorenzo Sonego and No. Serving for the match, Djokovic dealt with frustration at the finish line—even getting a time violation—but saved two break points and ultimately secured victory with an ace.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stefanos Tsitsipas finds himself in unfamiliar territory heading into this year's Rolex Shanghai Masters. 3 in the PIF ATP Rankings is very much in the hunt for a berth at the Nitto ATP Finals, an event he won on debut in 2019, and at which he qualified five straight years through 2023. After a near miss last season, the Greek seems destined to again sit out the season finale. The 27-year-old is hopeful that recent treatment on his back will allow him to play more freely, and he said that his sometimes-rocky coaching relationship with his father Apostolos is in a very health place. “We have changed our dynamic very much and I'm actually very happy the way we all cooperate and work together now,” Tsitsipas told ATPTour.com. While open to adding another voice to his coaching team, Tsitsipas said that he has great respect for his father's years of experience in the game. “My dad has been on the tour for a lot of years, even dating back to my mother's playing days. “I definitely see [our current coaching partnership] as something sustainable. I would be interested in the future to add a person in my team that can collaborate and work with my dad. Obviously he's not getting younger, so if I can find the right person, he can be by my dad's side a little bit, with a clear, fresher mindset. “That might also allow my dad to maybe take a step back a little bit to also enjoy life because it's not only tennis. Tsitsipas' resolve has been tested this year. After five Top 10 finishes between 2019-2023, and a No. “My focus would be a combination of seeing what my back allows me to do now and reconnecting a little bit with the wins,” the two-time Grand Slam finalist said. “Top of my list right now, I would definitely like to see a few matches in a row without back pain.” Tsitsipas dismissed reports that he had undergone back surgery, saying that a hospital visit was only for “a special type of examination”. “I won't go into details, but it's something that did help me a lot. So I'm just waiting to see how that responds in matches and how I'm able to compete in a much more healthy state.” Tsitsipas, who has played just two Davis Cup matches [in Athens] since the US Open, said that he feels fresh and recharged following vacation time in Greece, where he visited museums and historical sites such as the Athens Acropolis Museum, the Temple of Apollo and the National Gardens. He also practised three times with Novak Djokovic. “Getting to know Novak in a deeper way was nice because on the Tour, you don't have that opportunity," Tsitsipas said. “And I spent a lot of time connecting with my spirit in Greece. I spent a lot of time with my little sister, my brother Petros, who I always see on the court playing doubles with him. That is something that I lack a little bit in my daily life, a little bit of humanity, especially when you're constantly stressed and chasing points, tournaments, all that. It's important sometimes to take a break and reconnect with your humanity.” Tsitsipas, who defeated Djokovic in Shanghai in 2019 en route to his best semi-final finish at the event, opens his campaign Saturday against Portugal's Nuno Borges.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ben Shelton missed the opportunity to boost his Turin hopes on his return to Tour on Friday, when he lost to former World No. Shelton was competing for the first time since he was forced to retire during the third round at the US Open in August due to a left shoulder injury, which he described as ‘the worst ever pain in [my] life'. Upon return, he was slightly off the pace, committing 22 unforced errors to 11 from Goffin, who beat Carlos Alcaraz at the ATP Masters 1000 event in Miami earlier this year. "From the start, I started to feel really well with my ground strokes," Goffin said. "I took the ball early, I was returning really well and serving really well, like the first round. Shelton owns a 37-19 tour-level record in 2025, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, and has produced some of his best tennis on hard courts this year. Shelton's hard work meant he arrived in Shanghai sixth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin on 3,720 points and in a good spot to make his debut at the Nitto ATP Finals in November. However, the lefty could now be surpassed by seventh-placed Alex de Minaur (3,355) and eighth-placed Lorenzo Musetti (3,345) in the coming days. Auger-Aliassime plays Chengdu champion Alejandro Tabilo in his Shanghai opener. Goffin saved all three break points he faced against Shelton and leads the sixth seed 2-0 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series. The 34-year-old, who is a two-time Shanghai quarter-finalist, plays Gabriel Diallo in the third round on Sunday. Holger Rune is 14th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin but kept alive his chances of qualifying for the year-end event with a 7-5, 6-4 win against Sebastian Baez. Rune reached the quarter-finals in Tokyo last week and is searching for his first Masters 1000 title since Paris in 2022. Yannick Hanfmann poured more misery onto Frances Tiafoe, defeating the American 6-7(9), 6-2, 6-1. Tiafoe has now lost his past five matches and suffered a disappointing third-round exit at the US Open. Hanfmann will play Novak Djokovic or Marin Cilic in the third round.
