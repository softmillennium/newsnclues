                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LA NUCIA, Spain (Jan. 11, 2026) – The U.S. Under-17 Women's National Team drew 2-2 with Germany in the first of two friendly matches in Spain during its January training camp. The United States scored first and it came when forward Maddie DiMaria played a through ball to forward Deus Stanislaus, who dribbled around German goalkeeper Mirja Kropp and slotted the ball in the back of the net. In the 46th minute, Clara Choisy intercepted a pass between U.S. defenders and buried Germany's first of the day. Germany's Mia Kuhn then equalized in the 76th minute, ripping a shot from the top of the box which U.S. goalkeeper Avellina Saunders initially saved but Kuhn followed her rebound and knocked it home to tie the match. Seventeen players named to this roster by U.S. U-17 WNT head coach Ciara Crinion were born in 2009, the birth year cut-off for players to be eligible for the 2026 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, which will be staged in Morocco. Midfielder Loradana Paletta was born in 2011 with midfielder Gigi Zuniga and Saunders born in 2010. That team was also coached by Ciara Crinion. USA: 1-Avellina Saunders; 2-Kendra Hansen (18-Gigi Zuniga, 46), 4-Sophia Ahrens, 5-Anaiah Williams, 13-Sam Ogden (3-Venina Moodie, 76); 11-Amari Manning (16-Carolina Reyna, 62), 8-Loradana Paletta, 15-Jordyn Heathcock (6-Grace Murray, 46); 10-Mia Corona (Capt.)

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Xabi Alonso is gone, but Real Madrid's deeper problems remain. Did the club fail its coach - and can anyone truly manage this team? Xabi Alonso was sacked on Monday afternoon, a decision that said as much about Real Madrid as it did about the coach himself. The man the club had courted for years ultimately never fit, not because of a lack of ideas, but because Madrid struggled to accommodate them. Alonso arrived with a clear footballing vision and left as the fall guy for a team still unsure how - or whether - it wants to be coached. Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Jr, in particular, are wonderful footballers capable of carrying a team. But they don't fit into systems, and they are certainly reluctant to adapt to any sort of manager. Alonso may be an excellent coach, but he is not a man manager - not yet, at least. In his stead, Madrid have promoted academy manager Alvaro Arbeloa. He, too, is a former Madridista who "knows" the club. Perhaps he can conjure a little more consistency out of an immensely talented yet problematic group. But is any of this fair to Alonso? Sure, there were a couple draws and one or two losses, but they are four points back in La Liga and very much in the picture in the Champions League. Clasico losses sting that much is clear. Yet Alonso didn't have to go. Then again, would it have gotten any better? Ryan Tolmich: Wild as it was Monday, probably? Alonso clearly never commanded the respect of the team's top stars and when that happens, a coach generally has to go. The thing is, though, that there may not be a coach in the world who can actually tame that locker room. TH: Trying to coach the lads who couldn't be coached. Sure, Alonso became successful by being a nerdy guy, but he needed to change his approach to make it work out in the Spanish capital. There's a reason that the club had to keep hiring and rehiring Ancelotti and Zidane for the better part of a decade: respect. There's just a lack of respect for coaches at that club, save for names of a certain level. Many thought Alonso's playing career gave him that type of name, but it doesn't appear so. Sure, Alonso should have changed, but it was the lack of effort from Mbappe, Vinicius and Co. that was his downfall. They needed to buy in - or at least show some basic respect for the head coach. If Alonso says give the opponent a guard of honor, for example, they should bloody do it. Alonso will likely look back at a few moments he regrets. There were some where he was likely too rigid and others where he was likely too loose. Yes, it's good to have power, and it's important for players to have a say, but ultimately, the buck has to stop with the coach. The club will hope to find that central figure, one who can get everyone rowing in the same direction. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting Vinicius probably makes the most sense, even if he does have the "heir-apparent to Cristiano Ronaldo" vibe going on. Madrid can cash in big, and he gets a fresh start. He's probably a better team guy than Mbappe, but the Frenchman reigns supreme here - fairly or not. There's no shortage of attacking talent, and it's something of a waste to have so much money effectively tied up in two left wingers. Mbappe can play centrally, and he has, but that's not the best use of him. Would it not make more sense to turn one of those guys into an elite striker or midfielder or defender in transfer? Probably, but that's one of several things the club needs to address over the next year or so. This is an uncoachable club that needs a total overhaul. Any other team would realize that and act. Arbeloa perhaps has a slight leg up due to his experience in the academy, but it's otherwise an impossible job. He's the best of a poor group. He knows the club well, understands the politics at play, and is seemingly well-regarded as a young head coach. That lack of experience, though, is hard to look past, particularly at a club like this. Hey, maybe he's the next Pep Guardiola, who rose from similar ashes at Barcelona, but, more than likely, the club is reassessing this spot fairly soon. You'd probably exclude Barcelona and Manchester United from that group due to past rivalries. Also, Arne Slot's pits might have just gotten a bit sweatier in Liverpool. There will be no shortage of big clubs interested and, realistically, Spain could be, too, after the World Cup this summer. His exploits in Germany prove that he's a good coach who still needs one or two lessons to become great. Maybe Madrid was that lesson, and he'll be better for it. Some clubs will be eager to find out, for sure. TH: No, he made the right choice. Mbappe has wanted to play for Madrid since he was a literal child, and he has the right to go where he wants - especially if a team is stupid enough to blow up their wage structure and chemistry to accommodate him. He's 27 and hasn't really ever made a team markedly better. Unless he decides to buy in and fit into a system, he will just score loads of goals to no real effect. Would PSG's Champions League success sting for him? Oh yeah but, on numbers, there's no way that Mbappe's move has been a failure. Those numbers include goals and, just as importantly, a whole lot of money and exposure that have taken him to a new level globally. Are there some sporting things to figure out? For sure, but given Mbappe's talent, you can bet on him figuring it out, even if it requires a few steps back to go forward.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TANGIER, Morocco — Fans of two of Africa's top soccer nations have had their World Cup plans upended because of a travel ban imposed by the Trump administration. Senegal and Ivory Coast were added in December to the list of countries with partial restrictions on entry to the United States, which is co-hosting the June 11-July 19 tournament with Canada and Mexico. “I don't know why the American president would want teams from certain countries not to take part. Get the latest D-FW sports news, analysis and opinion delivered straight to your inbox. By signing up, you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The restrictions include an exception for players, team officials and immediate relatives traveling to the World Cup, but no allowance has been made for supporters. “We really want to participate but we don't know how,” said Fatou Diedhiou, the president of a group of female Senegal fans. “Now we just wait because the World Cup isn't here yet, maybe they'll change their minds. “So, since Senegal has qualified for the World Cup, we absolutely have to go.” Senegal, which has reached the Africa Cup semifinals, plays its first World Cup game in MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on June 16 against France, four days before facing Norway in the same stadium. Its final group stage match is in Toronto on June 26 against a playoff winner between Bolivia, Suriname and Iraq. Ivory Coast also has two games in the U.S., opening against Ecuador in Philadelphia on June 14 and finishing the group there on June 25 against Curacao after facing Germany in Toronto. Ivory Coast coach Emerse Faé was optimistic a solution can be found for supporters. He pointed out that Ivorian fans faced a similar hurdle getting to Morocco for the Africa Cup when a visa requirement was introduced before the tournament. “In the end, everything went very smoothly, and they were able to come as long as they had tickets to see the matches. “It's a celebration, football is a celebration, and for me, it would be a real shame – especially since the World Cup only comes around every four years – it would be a real shame not to let our supporters come and experience this celebration,” Faé said. Senegal and Ivory Coast face the prospect of playing only with limited support from fans who are legal U.S. residents, already have visas or have dual nationality with countries that are not affected by the travel ban. Ivory Coast winger Yan Diomande said there was little the players could do. “It's OK for us, we can play without supporters,” Diomande told The AP. “There's also an events committee managed by the Ivorian Football Federation, so I think together with the government, we'll put things in place to make it easier for our supporters,” Kessie said. One fan wearing a lion mask for Senegal said he can travel to the U.S. because he also has French citizenship, but he won't as “a matter of political conviction” and because of the high cost of tickets. “Even if there was no ban issue, I don't think that many people would have gone to the World Cup either because it's kind of expensive,” Detopeu said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>John Currie may no longer be the athletic director at Kansas State University, but he still took something away from KU. But that was before the World Cup draw, which set Germany's three matches in Houston, Toronto and East Rutherford, New Jersey. “Wake Forest is proud to partner with Winston-Salem to serve as the German Men's National Team's home base during the 2026 FIFA World Cup,” Currie said in a news release. “Hosting a four-time World Cup champion reflects the strength of our University soccer culture, which is truly world-class. With a new year upon us, I'm delighted to share an extraordinary announcement with our @WakeForest community.The German Men's National Team has selected The Graylyn Estate as its team base camp and Wake Forest as its official training site for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. FIFA is not expected to announce where all 48 teams competing in the 2026 World Cup will have their base camps until the final playoff matches have been played later this year. However, another nation that visited Lawrence also is poised to establish its camp elsewhere. Colombia and England also visited Rock Chalk Park, The Star reported. Neither has made a decision where it will have a base camp, but England reportedly had been interested in training at Sporting Kansas City's facilities. Defending champion Argentina also reportedly has interest in that site for a base camp. And reports from England say the Netherlands could be eyeing Kansas City, but there has been no official word. So perhaps Rock Chalk Park will get one of those big-time soccer teams. Get in-depth, sideline coverage of Kansas City area sports - only $1 a month</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ZURICH (AP) — FIFA deepened its commercial ties to the betting industry Monday in a four-year deal that will let some gambling operators livestream World Cup games this year. The deal with data provider Stats Perform — with brands including soccer statistics specialist Opta — runs through 2029 for most FIFA competitions “to distribute official betting data and livestreams” to account holders. “It also grants exclusive betting rights to thousands of matches per season across FIFA Member Association competitions powered by FIFA+,” the soccer body said, without stating the value of the deal. The FIFA+ website — which shows games from some FIFA competitions and lower-ranked leagues plus highlights from much of the World Cup archive — has now teamed with Saudi Arabia-backed streaming network DAZN. FIFA's previous World Cup tie-in with gambling was a regional sponsor deal in Europe for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Chicago-based Stats Perform said it will distribute FIFA betting data “to licensed sports betting operators for modeling, trading, settlement and in-play front-end use.” Its Opta subsidiary will supply gambling industry clients with “official player statistics, insights, live scores and match trackers.” The men's World Cup starts June 11 in Mexico City and will see 48 teams play 104 games across the United States, Canada and Mexico through July 19.

They completely ignored the grassroots aspect,” said the fan, who gave his name simply as Pape. Ivorian supporter Tan Detopeu, speaking in Casablanca, said she feared the team will have little support in the US because few Ivorian supporters can afford the tickets. “Even if there was no ban issue, I don't think that many people would have gone to the World Cup either because it's kind of expensive,” Detopeu said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The restrictions include an exception for players, officials and immediate relatives. But no allowance has been made for supporters Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. World Cup aspirations for supporters of two prominent African football nations have been thrown into disarray following the implementation of a US travel ban. Senegal and Ivory Coast were added in December to a list of countries facing partial entry restrictions into the United States, a co-host of the upcoming tournament alongside Canada and Mexico from June 11 to July 19. The restrictions have caused considerable dismay among fans currently following their teams at the Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco. “I don't know why the American president would want teams from certain countries not to take part. The restrictions include an exception for players, team officials and immediate relatives traveling to the World Cup, but no allowance has been made for supporters. “We really want to participate but we don't know how,” said Fatou Diedhiou, the president of a group of female Senegal fans. “Now we just wait because the World Cup isn't here yet, maybe they'll change their minds. "So, since Senegal has qualified for the World Cup, we absolutely have to go." Senegal, which has reached the Africa Cup semifinals, plays its first World Cup game in MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on June 16 against France, four days before facing Norway in the same stadium. Its final group stage match is in Toronto on June 26 against a playoff winner between Bolivia, Suriname and Iraq. Ivory Coast also has two games in the U.S., opening against Ecuador in Philadelphia on June 14 and finishing the group there on June 25 against Curacao after facing Germany in Toronto. Ivory Coast coach Emerse Faé was optimistic a solution can be found for supporters. He pointed out that Ivorian fans faced a similar hurdle getting to Morocco for the Africa Cup when a visa requirement was introduced before the tournament. “In the end, everything went very smoothly, and they were able to come as long as they had tickets to see the matches. “It's a celebration, football is a celebration, and for me, it would be a real shame – especially since the World Cup only comes around every four years – it would be a real shame not to let our supporters come and experience this celebration,” Faé said. Senegal and Ivory Coast face the prospect of playing only with limited support from fans who are legal U.S. residents, already have visas or have dual nationality with countries that are not affected by the travel ban. Ivory Coast winger Yan Diomande said there was little the players could do. “It's OK for us, we can play without supporters,” Diomande told The AP. “There's also an events committee managed by the Ivorian Football Federation, so I think together with the government, we'll put things in place to make it easier for our supporters,” Kessie said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It follows the seizure by US forces of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro in a raid on the capital city Caracas this month, along with warnings that US president Donald Trump has recently issued to a host of other countries. So with the US due to host both the World Cup and Olympics over the next two and a half years, what questions does America's foreign policy raise for sports organisations, and could any take a stand? Back in December, Fifa awarded Trump its inaugural 'Peace Prize' at the 2026 World Cup draw ceremony in Washington, saying he had "played a pivotal role" in establishing a ceasefire and promoted peace between Israel and Palestine, and that he has sought to end other conflicts. Now, 23 politicians from Labour, the Lib Dems, Green Party and Plaid Cymru have signed a motion, external in parliament, calling on international sporting bodies to consider expelling the US from major international competitions, including the World Cup. They say such events "should not be used to legitimise or normalise violations of international law by powerful states". Their motion also notes "repeated veiled and overt threats made by senior US officials", towards Denmark, Colombia and Cuba", saying it "undermines the rules-based international order". Trump said the US will now control Venezuela and its oil industry. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was "deeply concerned that rules of international law have not been respected" during the US action. Meanwhile, Trump has also told Cuba to "make a deal" over Venezuelan oil exports "before it is too late", and said a military operation targeting Colombia "sounds good". As with Venezuela, Trump has accused Colombia of not doing enough to tackle drug trafficking. Colombia president Gustavo Petro has told the BBC that he believes there is now a "real threat" of US military action against his country. Trump has also claimed that drugs are "pouring" through Mexico into America, adding "we're gonna have to do something", amid reports that he has started planning a mission to send in US troops. Mexico president Claudia Sheinbaum says she has rejected any US military action on Mexican soil. Trump has also insisted his country needs to take over Greenland for national security reasons and has not ruled out using military force. Gianni Infantino was elected president of Fifa in February 2016 Fifa declined to comment on the MPs' motion, and whether it may now reconsider the annual awarding of its peace prize in light of Trump's recent foreign policy. Such ties have led to accusations that Fifa has become politicised, although it insists that as an organiser of football events it has a statutory duty to remain neutral. However, comparisons have also been drawn with the way Fifa subsequently banned Russia after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, a sanction that remains in place. I'm very critical of Maduro, I want to be very clear on that, but what we've seen is a breach of international law. When you see how Russia has been treated, which is absolutely correct, I just want there to be consistency." Some at Fifa privately point out that the Russian Football Union is still a member association and that the ban on playing internationals was more down to teams refusing to play against Russia and security concerns, rather than the governing body taking a moral position. An insight into Fifa's approach came in October when Infantino said Fifa "cannot solve geopolitical problems" amid pressure to sanction Israel after a United Nations commission of inquiry concluded that it had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) also maintains a ban on Russian teams at the Games, with individual athletes only allowed to compete as neutrals, as long as they are admitted by the relevant sporting federations. "For this reason, the IOC cannot involve itself directly in political matters or conflicts between countries, as these fall outside our remit. IOC sources have told BBC Sport a distinction has to be made with Russia because  it took over Ukrainian territory and put athletes there under the control of the Russian Olympic Committee, which is against the Olympic Charter. Some believe that, depending on Trump's next moves, the situation could become harder for sports bodies to navigate. "Both organisations' charters emphasise peace, respect for sovereignty, and non-discrimination. Would European or Nato leaders refuse to attend US-hosted events? It's a looming stress-test for sporting institutions that pride themselves on neutrality, yet repeatedly find themselves forced to take political positions when international law and conflict collide with global competition." Fifa vowed to have a welcoming and unifying tournament, but there are now four competing countries - Iran, Haiti, Senegal and Ivory Coast - whose fans face full or partial travel bans, with the White House referencing a need to manage security threats. As Fifa's biggest-ever tournament approaches it will be fascinating to see what further impact US action overseas has on ticket sales, collaboration between the co-hosts on issues such as security, and whether sports bodies feel they need to do more to navigate a complicated geopolitical landscape.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sign up here to receive Full Time directly in your inbox. For once, we are starting with a U.S. women's national team player heading back to the NWSL rather than away from it. Expansion team Denver Summit got its hometown star, announcing today that U.S. captain Lindsey Heaps is headed to the Centennial State this summer on a 3 1/2-year deal. It's a significant move for both Heaps and the league, and fitting that the 31-year-old is once again breaking from the norm: You may remember she was the first American woman to forgo college to play abroad, joining Paris Saint-Germain in 2012 at 18 years old. Heaps then came back to the States in 2016 in part to prepare for the Olympics and 2019 World Cup. She was part of Lyon's record eighth European title in 2022. A few more details about the move to Denver: Before we move on, you have to watch Heaps' parents find out she is coming home in this sweet video from Denver. Just make sure you have a tissue box ready. Canadian defender Janine Sonis, who grew up in Highlands Ranch just outside of Denver, is also making the move after less than two seasons with Racing Louisville. There was plenty of movement in the NWSL last week. Here are some other non-Denver transfers that went down: The potential move of USWNT midfielder Sam Coffey to Manchester City leads the way on the intrigue meter, but here are a few more moves ranked by interest (my interest, that is — this is not a scientific system): We are also keeping a close eye on Cat Macario, who was not included in Chelsea's game day roster over the weekend. It's the disclaimer no Washington Spirit fan wanted to see, but knew was coming: Trinity Rodman has returned to the U.S. women's national team picture, but without a team. But her next club is still a mystery. Hayes also handed debut call-ups to four players: Seattle Reign forward Maddie Dahlien, 21, and midfielder Sally Menti, 23, Portland Thorns forward Reilyn Turner, 23, and North Carolina Courage midfielder Riley Jackson, 20. Coffey, a recent staple for the national team, was not included. Because the January friendlies are taking place outside of a FIFA window, Hayes has named a roster consisting entirely of NWSL players, meaning U.S. regulars such as Heaps, Lily Yohannes, Alyssa Thompson, Naomi Girma and Macario are not included. These games aren't until two weekends from now, but we wanted them on your radar early: This camp is the last before Hayes stops experimenting and starts dialing in her roster for World Cup qualifying later this year. And in case you were wondering if the NWSL's new High Impact Player rule has any effect on who gets a start — because one of the qualifying criteria for a better NWSL contract involves USWNT minutes — Hayes' answer is “no.” This is Armas' first head-coaching job in women's soccer after stints with the New York Red Bulls and the Colorado Rapids in MLS and in Europe as an assistant coach with Leeds United and Manchester United. New digs: The Chicago Stars announced plans for their very own training facility, just a few months before a key 2026 season for the NWSL original. We've come so far from the days of SeatGeek Stadium and getting temporarily bumped by RiotFest. The team also announced that Jodie Taylor, 39, has been appointed technical director. New schedule: The NWSL teased its 2026 schedule release for Thursday, which is good because I was about to bug Meg Linehan for it while she's away with baby Salem!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Women's National Soccer Team will play Chile in a friendly game at Harder Stadium on the UC Santa Barbara campus on Jan. 27 at 7 p.m. “Having a chance to play all together and coming at us… it was intimidating,” said Linda Meyer, a Gauchos player at the time. Aaron Heifetz, then an assistant coach for UCSB, reflected on how unusual that kind of college matchup would be today. The national team rolled to a 10–0 win that day and, aside from training camps, did not return to Santa Barbara until now. Heifetz, who is currently U.S. Soccer's Director of Communications, helped bring the team back to Harder Stadium this month. “There's a 15,000-seat stadium here in Santa Barbara, and it's called 'soccer heaven.' Welcome to soccer heaven,” Heifetz said to his colleague, who is in charge of booking the matches for the team. Meyer, who now works at UCSB, said she's proud her team played a part in the early days of the national program's rise. Heifetz also warned fans that campus parking can be limited and encouraged early arrival. The match will serve as the national team's season opener as it prepares for World Cup qualifiers this fall. Currently, there are nine players from California on the National Team roster.</p>
