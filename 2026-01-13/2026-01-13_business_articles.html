                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crude oil prices rose about 3% on Tuesday, after U.S. President Donald Trump canceled all meetings with Iranian officials and promised protesters that help is on the way. U.S. crude oil rose $1.96, or 3.29%, to $61.46 per barrel by 11:42 a.m. Global benchmark Brent was up $1.99, or 3.12%, to $65.86 per barrel. The Islamic Republic's security forces have cracked down on large-scale demonstrations with hundreds of people reportedly dead. The government has cut off Internet access in Iran, making it difficult to verify how the situation is evolving on the ground. Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene if the Islamic Republic kills protestors. "Iranian Patriots, KEEP PROTESTING - TAKE OVER YOUR INSTITUTIONS!!! Save the names of the killers and abusers," Trump said in a Truth Social post Tuesday. "They will pay a big price," the president said. "I have cancelled all meetings with Iranian Officials until the senseless killing of protesters STOPS. The oil market is monitoring whether the unrest could lead to a disruption of supplies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Tuesday slammed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell as either "incompetent" or "crooked," even as his Department of Justice faces growing opposition over its criminal investigation of the central bank leader. Trump threw his latest punch at Powell after being asked whether the unprecedented action undermines confidence in the Fed, which has long enjoyed independence from the executive branch. "He's billions of dollars over budget," Trump said, apparently referencing costs related to a multibillion-dollar renovation of the Fed's Washington headquarters, which is at the center of DOJ's probe. "I don't know what he is. Trump's comments to reporters outside the White House came as bipartisan criticism of the investigation, and support for the Fed's independence, continues to grow. "Everyone we know believes in Fed independence," JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told reporters earlier Tuesday after his bank released its fourth-quarter earnings results. "And in my view, it will have the reverse consequences, it will raise inflation expectations and probably increase rates over time." Dimon's remarks echoed similar concerns from a slew of Republican lawmakers, including some who are reliable supporters of Trump. "If you wanted to design a system to guarantee that interest rates would go up and not down, the best way to do that would be to have the Federal Reserve and the executive branch of the United States get in a pissing contest," Senate Banking Committee member John Kennedy, R-La., said Monday. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, expressed concerns to Trump that the DOJ probe could complicate existing plans to confirm the next Fed chair after Powell's term expires in May, CNBC has learned. But U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro signaled overnight that her office in Washington, D.C., has no plans to drop its legal effort against the Fed and Powell. "The United States Attorney's Office contacted the Federal Reserve on multiple occasions to discuss cost overruns and the chairman's congressional testimony, but were ignored, necessitating the use of legal process—which is not a threat," Pirro wrote in an X post. "The word 'indictment' has come out of Mr. Powell's mouth, no one else's. None of this would have happened if they had just responded to our outreach," Pirro wrote. We agree with the chairman of the Federal Reserve that no one is above the law, and that is why we expect his full cooperation," she added. Powell, on Sunday night, said the DOJ served grand jury subpoenas and threatened a "criminal indictment" based on his prior Senate testimony about the ongoing renovations of the central bank office buildings. Powell directly connected the probe to Trump's frequent complaints about the Fed lowering interest rates too slowly. "The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President," he said in a video statement. "But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure." Trump has said the subpoenas have nothing to do with his views on interest rates. I wouldn't even think of doing it that way," Trump told NBC News on Sunday night. "What should pressure him is the fact that rates are far too high. That's the only pressure he's got." We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said Tuesday that the Arctic island chooses Denmark over the U.S., pushing back against Donald Trump's repeated takeover threats. "If we have to choose between the USA and Denmark here and now, we choose Denmark. We choose NATO, the Kingdom of Denmark and the EU," Nielsen said, according to translated comments reported by Danish public broadcaster DR. He was speaking alongside Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen at a news conference in Copenhagen, ahead of crunch talks between U.S., Danish and Greenlandic officials at the White House on Wednesday. "The time has come to stand together," Nielsen added. "It has not been easy to stand up to completely unacceptable pressure from our closest allies for a lifetime. But there is much to suggest that the hardest part is still ahead of us," Frederiksen said. Trump's renewed interest in acquiring Greenland follows an audacious U.S. military operation to seize Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on Jan. 3. The U.S. president has also said that the mineral-rich island, which is strategically situated between Europe and North America, is vital "from the standpoint of national security." Opinion polls have previously shown that Greenlanders overwhelmingly oppose U.S. control, while a strong majority support independence from Denmark. Denmark has pledged to boost health-care spending and infrastructure investments in recent months, while also seeking to defuse tensions with the Trump administration by investing in Arctic defense, including the purchase of 16 additional F-35 fighter jets.

The 18-year-old will also serve as a global pickleball ambassador for Nike. She previously had an apparel and footwear deal with Fila that expired in 2025. Pickleball has seen explosive growth in recent years, but up until now, Nike has been slow to jump on the trend. The company is currently in the midst of a turnaround plan under new CEO Elliott Hill after lagging sales and a stock slump. The new partnership caps off a record-breaking year for Waters. Waters' pickleball career began in 2019, when she became the youngest pro pickleball player at the age of 12. "Growing up, I watched my idols wear the Swoosh in their biggest moments, so joining the Nike family is a dream realized," Waters in a statement. "Nike is the gold standard in performance and I can't wait to step onto the court representing a brand that believes in the same relentless pursuit of greatness that drives me every day." Last week, Waters announced she was switching paddle companies and joining Franklin Sports. Waters also has deals with major brands including Delta Air Lines, DoorDash and Ulta Beauty. She currently makes $2 million annually from the United Pickleball Association, according to a person familiar with Waters' earnings, who asked to remain anonymous to speak about nonpublic matters. Her new Nike partnership will debut this week as she competes at the Carvana Masters in Rancho Mirage, California, according to a representative for Waters.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft on Tuesday promised that consumers won't pay more when the software maker sets up data centers near their communities. "Our pledge to each of these communities is that we will pay our way as a company, to ensure that our data centers don't increase your electricity prices," Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and vice chair, said at an event held in Great Falls, Virginia, less than 20 miles from the White House. The company will sign deals with utilities in advance, so they can afford to invest in infrastructure that can support new data centers, Smith said. "We will pay utility rates that are high enough to cover our electricity costs in part by collaborating with utilities on plans to add the electricity supply that we will need," Smith said. The move comes as utility prices rise across the U.S., where technology companies are racing to build data centers that can run generative artificial intelligence models such as the ones that power OpenAI's popular ChatGPT assistant. These facilities contain special-purpose processors that generally require large amounts of energy to operate. In Caledonia, Wisconsin, where Microsoft was looking to build a data center last year, residents had grievances about water and power use, among other implications. We Energies, a local utility in Wisconsin, has proposed a special electricity rate for large clients' data centers, and Microsoft is asking the state's Public Service Commission to raise the rate the company pays, Smith said. On Monday, hours before Microsoft's event, President Donald Trump said in a Truth Social post that his administration has been working with the company, which "will make major changes beginning this week to ensure that Americans don't 'pick up the tab' for their POWER consumption." The company has maintained a healthy conversation with the White House going back to Trump's inauguration last year, Smith told CNBC's Eamon Javers. Burgum, secretary of the Interior Department and formerly governor of North Dakota, spent six years as a Microsoft executive after the technology company in 2001 acquired Great Plains Software, where he was CEO. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told analysts in October that the company plans to nearly double its data center footprint over the next two years. Microsoft has been building data centers for over 15 years. In the September quarter, the company spent nearly $35 billion on capital expenditures and finance leases for cloud and artificial intelligence infrastructure, up 75% year over year. "Our goal is to move quickly, partner with local communities, and bring these commitments to life in the first half of this year," Smith wrote in a blog post.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BEIJING — An Alibaba-backed startup is pushing artificial intelligence toward real-time, interactive video creation. PixVerse on Tuesday released an AI tool that allows users to control how a video unfolds while it is being generated. And just like a movie director, users can instruct characters to cry, dance or pose, with actions occurring instantly as the video continues. Real-time AI video generation can create "new business models," co-founder Jaden Xie told CNBC in an interview translated from Chinese. The possibilities, he said, include a world where users could influence how a micro-drama unfolds, or play an "infinite" video game that's not constrained by pre-designed storylines. More than half of the participating investors are from overseas, he said. Many offer faster generation speeds and far lower usage fees than OpenAI's advanced, premium AI video model, Sora 2 Pro. OpenAI's Sora first drew global attention nearly two years ago when it showed off a new text-to-video generation model, but it was not publicly available until December 2024. By then, several Chinese teams had already released competing tools to users globally. "Sora still defines the quality ceiling in video generation, but it is constrained by generation time and API cost," said Wei Sun, a principal analyst at market research firm Counterpoint, referring to the way users are charged for access to use AI models. They are turning video generation into a scalable, low-cost, high-throughput production tool." Just last month, Beijing-based startup Shengshu said its TurboDiffusion video framework, developed with researchers from Tsinghua University, could create videos 100 to 200 times faster with minimal quality loss. PixVerse's latest AI tool has removed most of the waiting time — and aims to be more than just a special effect. Its tools are embedded within the company's social media-style sharing platform, which surpassed 16 million monthly active users in October. Xie aims to reach 200 million registered users in the first half of this year, up from 100 million in August, and roughly double the team to nearly 200 employees by year's end. PixVerse primarily serves users outside China through a web-browser interface and smartphone app. Compared to China-made AI video tools, "most of the U.S. products are relatively simplistic and minimal" in user interface and experience, said Alyssa Lee, chief of staff at DataHub and a former vice president at Bessemer Venture Partners. Lee said scenario-specific AI video tools offer clearer monetization paths and pointed to Adobe as a traditional software provider facing pressure. Adobe, long a standard for video and design software, has seen its stock stagnate in recent months, she said, suggesting its "all-in-one creative suite is vulnerable to being unbundled by all these creative AI marketing tools." PixVerse estimated annual recurring revenue of $40 million in  October. Kling, an AI video tool developed by TikTok rival Kuaishou, posted nearly $100 million in revenue in the first three quarters of 2025, based on CNBC calculations from public disclosures. For now, Xie said that PixVerse is prioritizing technology development over commercialization and claimed the company has sufficient funding to operate for a decade. Addressing concerns about low-quality AI-generated content, often referred to as "slop," Xie compared the current stage of development to the early years of computer graphics, arguing that quality improves as technology matures.

JPMorgan Chase surpassed analyst expectations on both lines for the fourth quarter, sending shares up around 1% in premarket trading. The bank also said trading revenue came in stronger than forecasted. It precedes fellow financial giants Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, all set to share results later this week. Bank stocks, including JPMorgan, are coming off a harsh session after Trump called for a 10% one-year cap for credit card interest rates. As CNBC's Hugh Son reports, industry executives scrambled over the weekend to come up with action plans should Trump's idea — which they see as detrimental to their business models — materialize. Speaking of earnings: Shares of Delta Air Lines tumbled 5% this morning after the airline posted slightly lower revenue than Wall Street anticipated for the fourth quarter. However, Delta beat earnings per share expectations and projected a 20% profit jump in 2026, citing strong travel demand. "We expect not just a 20% increase in EPS for the year," Delta CEO Ed Bastian told CNBC's "Squawk Box" this morning. "We're expecting a 50% increase in EPS for the first quarter." Bookings have been solid for both leisure and business travel in 2026 so far, according to the Atlanta-based company. CNBC's Morning Squawk recaps the biggest stories investors should know before the stock market opens, every weekday morning. Trump said on social media yesterday that he would institute a 25% tariff on any country that does business with Iran, effective immediately. The president did not provide any other details about the order, which he said was "final and conclusive," and a White House spokesperson declined to answer CNBC's questions about the policy. The new tariff — an apparent effort to economically isolate the Middle Eastern country — comes after Trump threatened to take military action against Iran over the reported killing of dozens of anti-government protesters. Siri is getting an artificial-intelligence powered upgrade with the help of Alphabet. The Google parent's Gemini models will be used to help Apple roll out an enhanced version of its virtual assistant software, the companies announced in a joint statement obtained by CNBC. The upgraded Siri is expected later this year. Shares of Alphabet rose after the Siri announcement yesterday, helping it become the fourth company to reach a $4 trillion market cap.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Salesforce is bolstering its Slack app with generative artificial intelligence to help users find relevant information and sort through the mountains of communication chaos. "Because it lives inside Slack, Slackbot understands your conversations, files, channels, and the people you work with," the company said in a blog post. "It only sees what you can see, always respecting your permissions and access controls." Slackbot can find data in Slack, Salesforce, Google Drive, Box, Atlassian's Confluence and other services. It's using Anthropic's Claude model, though Salesforce is testing alternatives, co-founder and technology chief Parker Harris told CNBC. While the artificial intelligence boom has lifted the fortunes of tech companies ranging from chipmakers like Nvidia and Broadcom to internet giant Google, Wall Street has remained skeptical of how Salesforce and other enterprise software companies will fare, and whether some of them will ultimately be displaced. And services like OpenAI's ChatGPT aren't hooked into corporate systems. "People who say, 'oh I could vibe code up Slack and Salesforce now, and my AI is just going to do it all for me' are crazy," said Harris, who's been focusing on Slack in recent years. Salesforce bought Slack for $27.1 billion in 2021, by far its largest purchase on record. Since around the time Slack launched in 2014, the Slackbot digital assistant has been able to send people automated messages, including updates from third-party services. Google and Microsoft already offer AI add-ons inside their work productivity bundles. Across the software industry, companies have been incorporating models from the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic with hopes of fueling growth by increasing productivity for clients. Aside from Slackbot, Salesforce has been selling Agentforce services for automating customer service and other business functions. Harris said the new Slackbot helps him prepare for meetings and research topics. Slackbot was developed after two Slack engineers considered how CEO Marc Benioff might use an in-house tool instead of instinctively opening ChatGPT and uploading internal documents such as earnings scripts. Slackbot is the most quickly adopted feature in Salesforce's 27-year history, Harris said, adding that he expects people to switch to Slack from Microsoft Teams and that companies might now start getting rid of ChatGPT subscriptions when they see what it can do. In December, OpenAI hired Slack CEO Denise Dresser to be the startup's chief revenue officer. Rob Seaman, who had been Slack's product chief, became the unit's interim CEO. Demetri Salvaggio, vice president of customer experience and operations at business travel software company Engine, has been testing Slackbot's new capabilities and said he uses the feature to "sanity check" himself at the end of the workday and make sure he hasn't failed to respond to any important messages. Engine has licenses for Google's Gemini assistant and Anthropic's Claude, but they're not embedded in the company's Slack environment, Salvaggio said. He said Slackbot probably saves him 45 minutes to an hour per week.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. government will invest $1 billion in L3Harris Technologies' growing rocket motor business, guaranteeing a steady supply of the much-needed motors used in a wide range of ‍missiles such as Tomahawks and Patriot interceptors. It comes just a few days after President Donald Trump blasted defense contractors for slow production of weaponry. L3Harris said on Tuesday it ‌is planning ‌an IPO of its growing rocket motor business into a new publicly ​traded company backed by a $1 billion government convertible security investment. The securities will automatically convert to common equity when the company goes public later in 2026. "We are fundamentally shifting our approach to securing our munitions supply chain," said Michael Duffey, Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment. "By investing directly in suppliers we are building the resilient industrial ⁠base needed for the Arsenal of Freedom." The investment in a defense contractor is not a total surprise after U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick last August said the Trump administration was weighing equity stakes in major defense contractors, including Lockheed Martin. But the government's equity position in L3Harris could face blowback from L3Harris' rivals, given that it creates a potentially significant conflict of interest for the U.S. government. The Pentagon will have an ownership stake in a company that regularly bids on major defense and other government contracts. The investment marks the first direct-to-supplier partnership of this kind and is an outcome of the department's new Acquisition Transformation Strategy and its "Go Direct-to-Supplier" initiative. The strategy calls for the department to negotiate and invest directly with critical suppliers to save money. L3Harris' Missile Solutions unit, which produces missile propulsion systems for many missiles including Patriot, THAAD, Tomahawk, and the Standard Missile, will be carved out from the company. L3Harris will retain majority ownership and control of the new entity. "Recent Trump Administration actions have placed renewed emphasis on strengthening the defense industrial base and reinvigorating competition following a 30-year wave ‌of consolidation," Christopher Kubasik, Chairman and CEO, L3Harris said in a statement. "Building on several years of sustained investment and operational ⁠improvements by L3Harris, this new company will serve as a key partner," to the Pentagon. The Pentagon said in a release that the "partnership" with L3Harris positions it "to negotiate multi-year procurement framework agreements for solid rocket motors, vital to ‍several critical munitions, pending Congressional authorization and appropriations." The transaction structure—combining a government convertible preferred security with a planned public offering while maintaining parent company control—is highly unusual in the defense sector and may face scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers concerned about conflicts of interest and market competition. An IPO is planned in the second half of 2026 ⁠and could help the U.S. government turn a profit. J.P. ‌Morgan Securities LLC is acting as financial advisor to L3Harris, and Vinson & Elkins LLP is acting as legal advisor to L3Harris on the proposed transaction.

Big Law has a complicated relationship with artificial intelligence. The tools that make lawyers more efficient could result in fewer billable hours. Nick Fleisher learned that the hard way at McKinsey, where he helped elite law firms roll out tech tools, often with little enthusiasm from the lawyers expected to use them. That work led Fleisher to leave McKinsey and start a company in August. His startup, Sandstone, is aimed squarely at in-house legal teams instead of law firms, and Sequoia Capital is backing the idea. Backers include Kearny Jackson, SV Angel, the Chainsmokers' Mantis VC, Daybreak Ventures, and a group of corporate general counsels from companies including eBay and Bilt. Sandstone uses AI to help lawyers inside companies draft and review contracts based on how they've handled similar agreements in the past. McKinsey hired Fleisher out of the Wharton School. He landed on a team advising major law firms and worked closely with QuantumBlack, the firm's AI unit, including on a project with the American Arbitration Association to develop an "AI arbitrator" for construction disputes. In his final months at McKinsey last year, Fleisher ran dozens of workshops for general counsels who, he said, couldn't justify a full McKinsey engagement but wanted enough context to build their own tech strategies. Fleisher said many in-house teams were still wrestling with the basics: whether they were using their contract lifecycle management software correctly, how they tracked outside legal spend, and where their data actually lived. He was struck by how quickly that posture began to change. Increasingly, Fleisher said, general counsels told him they had a mandate from the CEO or board to adopt AI — even before there was clarity on how it would affect costs or head count. The pair pitched Sequoia on their last day at McKinsey. Software companies make up a large share of its user base, Fleisher said, though the company also works with clients in manufacturing, finance, logistics, and insurance. Harvey got its start selling tools to elite law firms and has since expanded into large enterprises. A growing crop of startups is developing tools to crank out contracts and scan the ones that land in the legal inbox. What Fleisher says was missing was a system of record for corporate legal teams: a single place to conduct legal work, pull in context from systems like email and Salesforce, and track what the legal team is actually doing day-to-day. "There's no platform that in-house lawyers think of as their core operating system," Fleisher said. If successful, Fleisher said, Sandstone could help lawyers spend less time sorting requests and more time weighing the calls that actually need a human decision. Bogomil Balkansky, a Sequoia partner, was first introduced to Fleisher through the firm's talent team, which flagged the consultant as someone to keep close. After several meetings, Fleisher told Balkansky he wanted to start his own legal tech company instead. The bet comes as investor interest in legal tech is accelerating. More than a third of that funding flowed into just three companies: Harvey, Clio, and Filevine, a system for managing legal work. Sequoia backed Harvey at an early stage and last year led a seed round for Crosby, a startup that combines software with lawyers to handle contracts for early-stage companies. Asked about investing in companies that could eventually compete, Balkansky said Sequoia's criterion comes down to whether a market is big enough to support multiple winners. There are more than a million lawyers in the US, many of them among the most expensive professionals companies hire.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a move that has been pushed for by lawmakers across the aisle, President Donald Trump on January 9 called for a one-year, 10% cap on credit-card interest rates. "Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, and even more, which festered unimpeded during the Sleepy Joe Biden Administration," Trump wrote. The easiest path for Trump to cap interest rates would be through congressional legislation. While it's unclear if the proposal would make it through Congress and onto the president's desk, given that similar legislation has yet to become law, Sen. Elizabeth Warren signaled she would work with the president on making it happen. Warren said in a statement that during a Monday call with Trump, she "told him that Congress can pass legislation to cap credit card rates if he will actually fight for it." In the third quarter of 2025, the most recent period for which data is available, credit card debt reached a record high of $1.23 trillion — a $24 billion increase from the previous quarter and a $67 billion increase from Q3 2024. A joint statement from the Bank Policy Institute, American Bankers Association, Consumer Bankers Association, Financial Services Forum, and Independent Community Bankers of America said that the "cap would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives" such as personal and payday loans. Bill Ackman, a hedge fund billionaire, also voiced his concerns, writing in a post on X that while he thinks Trump's proposal is "important," capping rates would "cause millions of Americans to have their cards cancelled as credit card companies lose the ability to adequately price subprime credit risk." Trump promised a 10% credit-card interest rate cap on the campaign trail, and his latest announcement follows recent bipartisan legislation pushing for a similar move. Bernie Sanders and Josh Hawley introduced a bill capping rates at 10% for five years, with the GOP's Hawley saying in a statement at the time that "working Americans are drowning in record credit card debt while the biggest credit card issuers get richer and richer by hiking their interest rates to the moon." Even as the Federal Reserve has stepped in to broadly lower interest rates, credit card rates have edged down but remained near record highs over the past year. That means that the Americans trying to chip away at their record-high credit card debt are paying more on those outstanding balances. It's not a glitch in the system that consumers are getting trapped by high interest rates — it's a feature, consumer protection experts previously told Business Insider. Hidden fees and shady terms can pull consumers in, and they won't realize what they signed up for until it's too late, Adam Rust, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America, said. "Credit-card companies can get away with charging high rates of interest because consumers aren't necessarily paying attention, and marketing doesn't focus on that," Rust said. At the same time, as creditors accrue higher debt loads and contend with higher interest rates, an increasing share of loans is simply going unpaid for 30 days or more. A 1978 Supreme Court decision allowed banks headquartered in states without usury laws — which aim to prevent companies from unfairly enriching themselves at the expense of borrowers — to set their own interest rates without impunity.</p>

He added Klarna approves purchases in real time based on a customer's current spending behavior, rather than income data that may be outdated. In a separate interview with CNN, Siemiatkowski criticized credit card rewards programs such as cash back and airline miles, saying they mainly benefit wealthier consumers while lower-income borrowers bear more of the costs. Even people who don't use credit cards, he said, pay more for everyday goods because merchants raise prices to cover card fees, while wealthier shoppers get that money back through rewards. Trump's weekend call to cap interest rates for a year sparked a sell-off in major financial stocks on Monday, including Capital One, Synchrony Financial, JPMorgan, and Citigroup. Analysts at UBS and Goldman Sachs have warned that a 10% cap on credit card interest rates could backfire as lenders would cut back on credit availability, making it harder for some consumers to borrow. SoFi CEO Anthony Noto said on Saturday the proposal could push consumers away from credit cards and toward personal loans.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said on Monday that even though data centers are "key" to the AI boom, tech companies must "'pay their own way,'" so that Americans don't have higher utility bills. "First up is Microsoft, who my team has been working with, and which will make major changes beginning this week to ensure that Americans don't 'pick up the tab' for their POWER consumption, in the form of paying higher Utility bills," Trump said on Truth Social, hinting at additional announcements in the coming weeks. Data centers drove up utility bills in at least 13 states, Business Insider previously reported. Over the past year, Microsoft has been planning for data centers in Wisconsin, Atlanta, Texas, and Michigan. The White House and Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The pressure on Big Tech to self-fund its energy needs comes as the Trump administration leans into the AI race with the Stargate Project, which is a massive $500 billion joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank announced by Trump early in 2025 to build AI infrastructure. As of 2026, at least one data center under the project is already underway in Texas. OpenAI's data center plans will cost $400 billion and require seven gigawatts of power, Business Insider previously wrote, more than that of the entire New York City. Some tech companies are also moving their planned facilities off the grid entirely for easier permitting and less community resistance. To shield residents and small businesses from rate hikes, utilities in states like Indiana and Ohio have also started enforcing tariffs on power-hungry tech facilities.</p>
