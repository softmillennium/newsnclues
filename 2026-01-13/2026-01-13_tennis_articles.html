                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tatjana Maria defeats Venus Williams in a historic match at the Hobart International, showcasing her slice-centered game in windy conditions. Maria's win over 45-year-old Williams came after a tough loss to 17-year-old Emerson Jones in Brisbane. Germany's Tatjana Maria defeated Venus Williams 6-4, 6-3 on Tuesday in the first round of the Hobart International, a match that carried historic weight on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz. The win marked Maria's first of the season, coming one week after she was upset by 17-year-old Emerson Jones in the opening round of the Brisbane International -- a result that may have landed less comfortably at home, given that Williams is one of the favorite players of Maria's daughters, Charlotte, 12, and Cecilia, 4. 1 to be one of their favorite players -- though she hoped they were rooting for her. said Maria, who makes her family home near Williams in Florida. Maria's win capped what proved to be a difficult day for the two major champions that featured on Hobart's order of play. Earlier, Barbora Krejcikova was slowed by knee trouble in a 2-hour and 32-minute contest against Peyton Stearns -- the American's first victory since the US Open. Other winners on Day 2 in Hobart included third seed Iva Jovic, who like Bondar won the first 11 games of her 6-0, 6-1 romp against Indonesia's Janice Tjen, Magdalena Frech, who pulled away in a 6-4, 6-0 win over France's Elsa Jacquemot; and Slovakia's Rebecca Sramkova, a three-set winner against Jacquemot's countrywoman Varvara Gracheva. 1 seed Emma Raducanu's opener against Camila Osorio was rained off with the Briton leading 6-3, 2-4, deuce. After two short pauses for drizzle, the first extended off-court delay came as Raducanu served at 4-2, 15-30 in the second set. On resumption, the pair managed to play only three points -- all ended with clean winners -- before play was called for the day.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Monfils, who in 2025 became the oldest man to win a tour-level title since 1977, was honoured with a personalised Maori spear (taiaha) after his 5-7, 6-3, 6-4 defeat to Fabian Marozsan. I have been playing here since an early age,” said Monfils, who made his first Auckland appearance in 2007. Last week, Monfils watched his wife Elina Svitolina match his achievement from last year by claiming the WTA 250 title in Auckland. At her trophy ceremony, Svitolina said: “Before the tournament, he told me it would be amazing if we both won the same tournament. I always had it in the back of my mind.” For Marozsan, Tuesday's win marked his second victory over Monfils in Auckland and levelled their Lexus ATP Head2Head series at 2-2. The Hungarian can now look forward to a second-round clash with second seed Casper Ruud. Alex Michelsen and Marcos Giron also advanced on Tuesday in Auckland, where they set an all-American meeting. Michelsen, who reached the Brisbane semi-finals last week, overcame Mariano Navone 2-6, 6-2, 7-5, while Hong Kong semi-finalist Giron beat Alexandre Muller 6-2, 6-2. Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard served 22 aces, according to Infosys ATP Stats, in his 6-3, 7-6(2) win over two-time champion Roberto Bautista Agut. The 6'8” Frenchman will next face Briton Cameron Norrie, who was born in Auckland and reached two finals there. Former Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion Hamad Medjedovic continued his run through qualifying to defeat Aleksandar Kovacevic 6-4, 3-6, 7-6(2).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For more than three years, Craig Boynton coached John Isner, the former No. Opelka has long learned from former World No. 7 Jay Berger, who remains a key part of his team. But he will now travel with Boynton, who most recently developed Hubert Hurkacz into a Top-10 player. “He's one of the best coaches in the world and I think between him and Jay Berger, I'm incredibly lucky,” Opelka told ATPTour.com. It is important to note that despite both Isner and Opelka ranking among the very best servers in history, they are not clones. Perhaps their greatest similarity is that they jokingly refer to themselves as “servebots”. Ultimately, every tennis player here has the same goal and everybody has different skill sets,” Boynton said. “Obviously, people are going to look at the similarities between Reilly and John, but they are different players. That made his victory Monday against Alexei Popyrin at the Adelaide International even sweeter. The four-time ATP Tour titlist, who missed nearly two years after hip and wrist surgeries, is excited to kickstart his year. “[That is] something you don't get over quickly. Maybe 10 years it takes to get over one of those. So, happy that I got a win.” Get official marketing communications from the ATP and WTA!
