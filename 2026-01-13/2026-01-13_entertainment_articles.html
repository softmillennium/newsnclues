                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The promo campaign that began in earnest with a five-hour livestream of mostly-empty chairs continues to be extremely drawn out. This morning, Marvel shared its fourth teaser for Avengers: Doomsday in as many weeks, this time uniting the Fantastic Four with apparently the entire nation of Wakanda. Yes, it's Shuri (Letitia Wright) doing the voiceover and King M'Baku (Winston Duke) shaking the hands, but the gang's all here. As the teaser concludes, “The Wakandans and The Fantastic Four Will Return In Avengers: Doomsday.” Also returning, apparently is Namor (Tenoch Huerta Mejía) who made his MCU debut in 2022's Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. The only one of The Fantastic Four to show up in the clip is The Thing (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) who pulls a classic New Yorker move of introducing himself based on the streets he lives between. =Wright has teased the slightest bit about her role in Doomsday before. “It's just an ensemble of greatness, so I was just really excited to just be a part of it,” the actor said in June (via ComicBookMovie.Com) “I've been a part of it before, but in a smaller way. Now, I have a little bit more.” And that is probably about the extent of what Marvel will allow her to say before Avengers: Doomsday arrives in theaters on December 18, 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Heated Rivalry, the wildly popular queer hockey drama starring Connor Storrie and Hudson Williams, has taken the world by storm since its premiere in November. The Justin Tierney-helmed Crave original (which airs on HBO Max in the states) has garnered hundreds of thousands of fans who have fallen in love with the show's synchs and score, and they'll soon be able to stream its official soundtrack, Billboard can exclusively confirm. The Heated Rivalry original series soundtrack, crafted by show composer Peter Peter, will arrive on all platforms via Milan Records on Friday (Jan. 16). Billboard can also confirm that a vinyl edition is in the works. I honestly can't imagine this series without it. 's seminal “All the Things She Said.” Thanks to the series' rabid fandom and Tierney's poignant direction, those synchs have received astronomical streaming boosts, as reported by Billboard. “I'd never allowed myself such latitude in composition before. Jacob and [author] Rachel [Reid, who penned the book Game Changers on which the show is based] deserved the very best of me, so I gave them every ray of light I had.” Check out the complete Heated Rivalry (Original Series Soundtrack) tracklisting below: A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

Take a gander at this year's assorted jury members for the Sundance Film Festival, and their deep connections to the fest should be clear. The 17-member jury cohort includes an unusually (and purposely!) high number of filmmaker alumni, including names like A.V. Rockwell, Janicza Bravo, Bao Nguyen, Azazel Jacobs, Jennie Livingston, Nisha Ganatra, So Yong Kim, and many more. A further treat for real Sundance fans: beloved festival and programming alumni John Cooper and Trevor Groth, who will return to Park City, Utah, to judge the forward-thinking NEXT section. Related Stories ‘Hamnet' Also Won the Entire Weekend After the 2026 Golden Globes, Count on International Oscar Love, from Stellan Skarsgård to ‘KPop Demon Hunters' “Planning this special year, it felt especially meaningful to invite a slate of jurors who have a rich history with the Festival, all deeply rooted in the creative community they will now help champion,” said Kim Yutani, the Festival's director of programming, in an official statement. “It's a full-circle way to honor many of the artists, partners, and industry members who have played such a pivotal role in shaping the Sundance Film Festival's legacy for more than 40 years.” The jury, which includes both film and science professionals, presents the award to an outstanding feature film focusing on science or technology as a theme or depicting a scientist, engineer, or mathematician as a major character. In-person audiences will participate in selecting the 2026 Audience Awards, which are available to films in the U.S. Competition, World Competition, and NEXT. Attendees will also have the opportunity to vote for the Festival Favorite, chosen from all in-person eligible feature film screenings. The festival will be held from January 22 through February 1, 2026, in person in Park City and Salt Lake City, Utah, with the at-home program available online from January 29 through February 1, 2026, for audiences across the country. As Eugene Hernandez, director of the Sundance Film Festival and Public Programming, noted in his own statement: “This year's jury represents a rare depth of creative conviction and exceptional range, made up of artists and thinkers who know what it means to take risks,” “They bring curiosity, rigor, and a deep respect for bold storytelling, qualities that are essential to discovering the films that will define the future of independent cinema.” U.S. DRAMATIC COMPETITION JURY Janicza Bravo is a writer and director mostly but sometimes an actor. And her debut feature, “Lemon,” also premiered at the Festival in 2017. She has directed extensively in television, including a limited series, “The Listeners,” for BBC.

Kim's subsequent features, “For Ellen” and “Lovesong,” also premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. Tatiana Maslany is an actor with over 30 years of credits, including her Emmy Award–winning performances in “Orphan Black.” Her most recent credits include Osgood Perkins' “Keeper,” “The Monkey,” and Apple TV's upcoming “Maximum Pleasure Guaranteed.” Her performance in “Grown Up Movie Star” won her a Special Jury Prize at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. Toni Kamau is a News and Documentary Emmy– and Peabody Award–nominated producer who grew up in Kenya watching rerun sitcoms and international news on the state broadcaster — her only window to the wider world. Traveling later deepened her fascination with how stories shape understanding. Her nonfiction credits include “Softie” (2020 Sundance Film Festival), “I Am Samuel,” and “The Battle for Laikipia” (2024 Sundance Film Festival). His work has been recognized at major festivals worldwide, including Cannes, Berlinale, SXSW, and Telluride.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Timothée Chalamet is “Dune” too much, according to Chelsea Handler. When host Amanda Hirsch asked whether the actor took promotion “too seriously,” Handler agreed, “It seems so.” The former “Chelsea Lately” host, 50, explained, “He seemed pretty serious about winning and getting acknowledged for his great acting.” While Handler clarified she does believe Chalamet, 30, is “a great actor,” she noted, “It's hard to hear someone talk about how great they are at acting.” Hirsch, 37, chimed in to say Leonardo DiCaprio is her “gold star” when it comes to acting like a “real movie star” in Hollywood — and the Oscar winner would never brag about his performance. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. “Even though it took him so long to win, right? I haven't heard any actor kind of talk like that.” Hirsch speculated that Chalamet may have been going the “method” route and acting like his character, table tennis champion Marty Reisman, in interviews. “That would be my only excuse for me,” she noted. Elsewhere in the episode, Hirsch and Handler discussed Chalamet declaring his love for girlfriend Kylie Jenner during his acceptance speech at the Critics' Choice Awards 2026. After Hirsch explained why Chalamet's public shoutout was a major deal for fans, she brought up one particular line in his speech, “I couldn't do this without you.” Handler called this “ridiculous” and “stupid” because “obviously he could do [his career] without” Jenner. Chalamet — who has been dating Jenner, 28, since 2023 — mentioned the makeup mogul again when he took home a Golden Globe over the weekend. The “Beautiful Boy” star also addressed his past losses, saying, “[Gratitude] has allowed me to leave this ceremony in the past empty-handed, head held high, grateful just to be here.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Both went on to take the Visual Effects Oscar for the same quartet of Joe Letteri, Stephen Rosenbaum, Richard Baneham and Andrew R. Jones. Fire and Ash — which has grossed more than $1.23 billion worldwide in less than a month in theaters — will battle for the marquee Outstanding Visual Effects in a Photoreal Feature prize against Apple Original Films' F1 and The Lost Bus and Universal's Jurassic World: Rebirth and How to Train Your Dragon. RELATED: 2026 Awards Season Calendar: Dates For Oscars, Guilds, Grammys, Tonys & More Elsewhere, a trio of toons — Sony Pictures Animation's KPop Demon Hunters, Disney/Pixar's Elio and Walt Disney Studios' Zootopia 2 — drew five nominations each, followed by Apple Original Films' The Lost Bus with four. That trend held last year, when Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes won Outstanding Visual Effects in a Photoreal Feature — though it was the pic's only win on six nominations — but Dune: Part Two went on to claim Best Visual Effects at the Academy Awards. The top TV nominees are Netflix's just-wrapped Stranger Things, HBO's The Last of Us and Apple TV/BBC Studios' Prehistoric Planet: Ice Age with four VES noms each. “Visual effects artists and producers are at the forefront of cinematic artistry and technological innovation, whether their work is being seen on the big screen in a movie theater, on the device in your pocket or in a special venue setting,” VES Board Chair Kim Davidson said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two years after a rift between HGTV's popular mother-daughter renovation team, Mina Starsiak Hawk and Karen E. Laine, ended their hit show, “Good Bones,” the two have made strides in healing their relationship off-screen. In a big improvement since their show ended in the fall of 2023, the mother-daughter duo are on speaking terms again, Starsiak Hawk told People, and periodically spend time together. “We're not like best friends that braid each other's hair on Saturday nights or anything, but no, it's good.” Two weeks later, she stunned fans by revealing she was estranged from her mom and brothers, who were also part of the show. During a very emotional episode of her “Mina AF” podcast that month, she said, ““My mom and I aren't in a great place. My brother Tad and I aren't in a great place. My brother William and I are in a kind-of-like-nonexistent place. In the years since their rift, Starsiak Hawk and Laine have been busy. Starsiak Hawk has continued to renovate homes in Indianapolis, and has made multiple appearances on HGTV including an episode of “House Hunters: All Stars.” HGTV announced in October 2025 that its seventh season of “Rock the Block” will, for the first time, feature HGTV stars past and present, paired with a celebrity partner. Starsiak Hawk, who spent eight seasons starring on “Good Bones,” will return, teaming up with former NFL star and Super Bowl champion Vernon Davis. She told People that while she was filming the show in Las Vegas, her family “came out and visited and they got to see the house and the set,” noting that they “very much missed” her being on TV. Their visit reminded the kids of having HGTV crews around, she said, and kept asking, “‘Mom, when are you going to build houses again on TV? Laine, meanwhile, split from her fourth husband and sold the North Carolina property where she had planned to retire after restoring it for a 2024 “Good Bones” spinoff (on which she and Starsiak Hawk appeared separately, with updates on their lives). In May 2025, Laine — who worked as a lawyer before “Good Bones” — announced that she had joined the Indianapolis law firm of criminal defense attorney Josiah Swinney. I am wishing Mina good luck in all her endeavors, she is a strong person and a fighter, go for it you are talented and very special.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trevor Noah will be back for one last go-round as host of the Grammy Awards, CBS said Tuesday. The Emmy-winning, and Grammy-nominated comedian will return for his sixth and final time as host and also will serve as executive producer for the February 1 ceremony in Los Angeles. He continued to serve as host and executive producer after leaving The Daily Show in December 2022. 2026 will be the last time the Grammy Awards will air on CBS, where it has aired every year since 1973. Beginning next year, the show moves to ABC as part of the Grammys' 10-year deal with Disney, which was announced last year. The Grammys will air on ABC, Hulu and Disney+ from 2027, taking it through to 2036. RELATED: 2026 Awards Season Calendar: Dates For Oscars, Guilds, Grammys, Tonys & More “I am beyond thrilled to welcome Trevor Noah back to host the Grammys for his sixth, and sadly, final time,” said Grammys executive producer Ben Winston in a statement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Marshals Service for help in locating the West Wing actor. That is simply because we believe he is outside the state of New Mexico,” a spokesperson for the police department tells Rolling Stone. The 68-year-old is charged with two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and one count of child abuse related to twin child actors he worked with on the Fox television series The Cleaning Lady. An investigation into the Emmy Award-winning actor and director was launched in November 2024, when police were called to the University of New Mexico Hospital over concern that two young boys were possibly “groomed” by Busfield. The boys referred to Busfield, who served as executive producer and a director for the show, as “Uncle Tim” and described unwanted tickling. At the time, neither child disclosed any sexual contact, and no further action was taken. But by October 2025, the boys' mother called Child Protective Services, stating “her children both disclosed that there was sexual abuse by Timothy from around November 2022 to spring 2024,” according to the arrest warrant obtained by Rolling Stone. Officials subsequently obtained therapist records where one of the boys disclosed “that a director of a series … had engaged in inappropriate touching.” Diagnosed with PTSD and anxiety, the child was so distraught that he was having “nightmares about the director touching him and waking up scared,” according to the warrant. In interviews with officials, one of the boys claimed Busfield had repeatedly touched his private areas over his clothes while filming the show. The boy said he “was afraid to tell anyone because Tim was the director, and he feared Tim would get mad at him.” Investigators noted they interviewed Busfield and his wife, Little House on the Prairie star Melissa Gilbert, over speakerphone in November. Busfield acknowledged there was a “playful environment” on set and that parent company Warner Bros. investigated a similar complaint against him, but the claims couldn't be substantiated. “There would never be a weird moment about it. I don't really remember picking those boys up,” Busfield told investigators, according to the warrant. “I remember picking up the boy who followed them. After conducting several interviews with members of the production crew, the detective submitted his findings, writing “in my training and experience, pedophiles often infiltrate families under a trusted role, like Timothy, who, as a producer, exploited the hectic film sets to tickle and touch [the child actor] on his penis and buttocks, masking it as play,” according to the arrest warrant. “This dual tactic, charming parents while secretly violating the child, builds a web of complicity that is hard to unravel, delaying detection, as families trust the abuser's facade.” Lizzo Settles Lawsuit Tied to Sydney Sweeney's ‘Great Jeans' Controversy L.A.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scott Adams, creator of the long-running comic strip Dilbert who courted controversy as a late-career political and social commentator, died today after a battle with cancer. Adams' ex-wife, Shelly, confirmed his death in a video message. Shelly Adams relayed a message Scott wrote to his fans earlier this month. “For the first part of my life, I was focused on making myself a worthy husband and parent, as a way to find meaning,” Scott wrote. “That worked, but marriages don't always last forever and mine eventually ended in a highly amicable way. He went on to write that he needed a “new focus”: “I looked for ways I could add the most to people‘s lives.” He discussed the success of his 2014 book, How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big. “I still hear every day how much the book changed lives,” he wrote. “I didn't plan it this way,” he wrote, “but [the podcast] ended up helping lots of lonely people find a community that made them less lonely. If I got any benefits for my work, I'm asking that you pay it forward as best as you can. Adams revealed on his podcast last May that he'd been diagnosed with prostate cancer, and the disease had already spread throughout his body. Adams admitted that his prognosis was not good, and he spent much of the year trying various treatments. He eventually pleaded with Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and President Donald Trump to receive access to the cancer drug Pluvicto. “He was a fantastic guy, who liked and respected me when it wasn't fashionable to do so,” Trump wrote in a statement. While some of these treatments appeared to alleviate Adams' pain, his condition did not improve. In a message shared on Jan. 1, Adams said he'd lost all feelings in his legs and was struggling with “ongoing heart failure.” “The odds of me recovering are essentially zero,” he said. ”I'll give you an update if that changes, but it won't.” Though a fan of comics and avid illustrator from his childhood, Adams began his career in the white-collar world he would end up lampooning with Dilbert. He often peppered these drawings into presentations for upper management. “My comics weren't funny in the ha-ha sense,” Adams wrote in the intro to a Dilbert compendium, “but they reminded people of their jobs, and that seemed to be enough.” Adams eventually left the bank, pursued an MBA, and got a new job at Pacific Bell. But Adams still wasn't making enough money to quit his day job. “Technology workers embraced Dilbert as one of their own,” he wrote in the compendium. Dilbert became shorthand for bad management, oppressed cubicle workers, and high-tech life.” The following year, he published The Dilbert Principle, a business book mixed with comics, that began a New York Times bestseller. The book's title came from Adams' inversion of the Peter Principle, a maxim that employees are promoted because of their successes, but eventually reach a point where they are no longer competent. The Dilbert principle — traced back to a quote in a 1995 strip — posited that managers and higher-ups are actually successful morons whose stubbornness is confused for real leadership qualities. “[I]n many cases the least competent, least smart people are promoted, simply because they're the ones you don't want doing actual work,” Adams said in a 2002 interview. Adams would enjoy massive success in the decades to come. There were copious Dilbert books and other merchandise, desktop computer games, and an animated TV show that aired for two seasons. One of these, 2017's Win Bigly: Persuasion in a World Where Facts Don't Matter, captured the themes and thinking that would come to define the final decade of Adams' life. A few years prior, Adams was one of the few people to correctly predict that Donald Trump would become president based on his powers of persuasion. At the time, Adams was often critical of Trump, and in his book he described himself as an “ultraliberal”; still, as someone long-fascinated with the art and power of persuasion, he was awed by Trump's rise to power, and often wrote glowingly about it. This made Adams a favorite among Trump supporters, who backed his work amid heavy criticism on social media. Adams later said one of the reasons he wrote Win Bigly was “so many people who supported me on Twitter specifically asked me to write it,” and he called the book “a favor returned.” While he continued to write and draw Dilbert, he also hosted the popular podcast, Real Coffee With Scott Adams, which frequently featured interviews with right-wing figures like former congressman Matt Gaetz and commentators Dave Rubin and Greg Gutfeld. Adams' politics appeared to shift, too, and he soon found himself embroiled in culture war controversies, often surrounding race. In 2022, over 75 newspapers dropped Dilbert after Adams introduced the strip's first Black character, which he then used as a prop to mock “wokeness” (the character identified as white and LGBTQ+ for work purposes). A year later, hundreds more papers — including the The Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, and the entire USA Today network — dropped the comic after Adams called Black Americans a “hate group” that white Americans should “get the hell away from” after a conservative organization poll claimed to show that many Black people didn't think it was OK to be white. Adams insisted his comments were “hyperbole,” while also doubling down as an ostensible cancel culture martyr.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's hard to read the 1981 Shonen Jump romantic comedy Stop!! Fast and loose gags which involve trans teens competing in sports or using the girls' locker room read differently today, when rhetoric around transgender people has reached absurd—and deadly—new lows. But these were the furthest things from Hisashi Eguchi's mind, over 40 years ago. treats concerns like being outed as jokes, concocted by goofy antagonists who want to get one over on the main heroine. Eguchi handles their fuss over Hibari's anatomy or sexual morality as gags because, on some level, he doesn't take them seriously. As the writer and artist, he uses sequential storytelling to build jokes around a cherubic, sexually desirable young girl who doesn't understand her family's hang-ups and chooses not to internalize them. opens on Kohsaku, a teenage boy whose father drank himself to death, as his mother dies in hospice from an unspecified illness. As per her last wishes, the boy travels to Tokyo to board with Ibari Oozora, a mustachioed mob boss with a rank-and-file squad of goons in sunglasses at his beck and call. No sooner does Kohsaku arrive than he is introduced to Ibari's daughters—Suzume, Tsubame, and Tsugumi. No girl takes his interest, however, quite like Hibari—flirtatious and funny, she makes an immediate impression on the young man. It doesn't last long; by the fourth chapter, he's already having wet dreams about his new housemate. However, he'll have to get in line: Hibari is the most popular girl at school. is refreshing for its blunt flirtations with realistic ugliness. Yet an era of young adult comics pitched towards queer teenagers has approached trans identity as it pertains to teens with kid gloves and validity vaguespeak. Such depictions can feel disconnected from reality—comfortable escapism and nice “what ifs” that don't show queer characters against active, malicious bigotry. While escape is important, it doesn't arm a reader with tools to disentangle hatred because it presumes the reader is already progressive-minded. The fact that Eguchi does just this, albeit imperfectly, is not only modern but still feels novel by weight of comparison. That said, this is a manga from the early '80s. In acknowledgement, North American publisher Peow2 has included a disclaimer at the top of this volume, warning readers of dated caricatures and stereotypes within. Indeed, it's hard to bring up Hibari-Kun for a general audience and not at least mention Eguchi's questionable depictions of race. It's an unfortunate and inadvertently hateful visual gag, born in a decade in which Sanrio openly marketed characters like Sambo, Hannah, and squat islander caricatures Binbinba. But while certain nomenclature and depictions may be outdated, the overall themes of Stop!! Eguchi does not present his heroine as a problem to be solved; instead, the main tension is Kohsaku's inability to see Hibari on her own terms. This feels more timeless and prescient than much “coming out” YA media of the past decade, because it navigates regressive norms to arrive in transgressive territory. Yet because of Hibari's fixation on him, he's forced to ask complicated questions about his sexuality that play out as a flirtatious rom-com. It predates the gender-bending romantic antics of Ranma 1/2, with none of the magical macguffins to cushion potentially uncomfortable questions about attraction. What this forces readers to grapple with, ultimately, asks more of them than something like Ranma or the later, similarly absurd sex-change yuri series KashiMashi. While there is something to be said for the hegemonic femininity Hibari embodies, even the suggestion that a trans woman can achieve this beauty is audacious. Eguchi's belief in Hibari shows that while he might find her funny, he ultimately empathizes with and doesn't want to see harm befall her. throughout its absurdity, and elevates it as a strong example of early queer representation in popular shonen. Where a lesser series would lean into making a spectacle of Hibari, Eguchi's care for his principal cast ensures that the reader isn't led towards hateful misconceptions. If anything, those willful misunderstandings— characters failing to meet Hibari on her terms—are often embodied by antagonists who want to out, humiliate, or otherwise wrong the character. As is the promise in romantic comedies of the era, each new trial nudges Kohsaku and Hibari closer toward a potential union. This is the first of three volumes, which will conclude with the proper ending Eguchi drew between 2009 and 2010 based on his original storyboards. Originally, Hibari-Kun was cut short by artist protest; fed up with Jump's weekly deadlines, Eguchi locked himself in a hotel and refused to leave, which prompted his editor-in-chief, Shigeo Nishimura, to can the series in retaliation—even with a successful anime adaptation airing! This bore out into an eventual boon for English readers, however. Hibari-Kun!, its mercifully short length comes as a gift in a landscape of manga shelves sagging with tome upon ceaseless tome of non-descript adolescent romance. For all their length and multitude, few can match the wit, heart, and forward-facing attitudes found in just this single volume's story. But for all his comic's transgressions, it's Eguchi's crisp and stylish art—printed here in crisp, sturdy pages between a microtextured dustjacket—that steals the show. The future commercial artist demonstrates a canny spatial awareness and momentum to his panel layouts; readers are pelted with visual gags which segue into each other, set up by things like sliding doors or the crunching of snacks. Jokes and emotional beats are given proper space to breathe, as fashionable, attractive characters pose alongside absurdist stereotypes. Few artists who have gone through Jump have as keen a grasp on atmosphere and momentum as is on display in Stop!!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Matt Damon's wife, Luciana Barroso, didn't think he was “the cute one” in “Good Will Hunting” before they met. Barroso told her now-husband that she had once had a crush on his co-star — and best friend — Ben Affleck, “probably a few months” into their relationship, which began in 2003. “Her best friend thought I was the cute one,” he confirmed. After his partner's confession, Damon told her, “You got the wrong one.” When Howard Stern pointed out that Barroso worked with both Damon and Affleck on “The Rip,” the latter weighed in on his pal's wife's past feelings about him. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Damon agreed, quipping, “Finally, she met him and all that went away.” He went on to wed Jennifer Lopez in 2022, but the duo called it quits two years later. Amid Affleck's tumultuous love life, he has maintained his close bond with Damon and Barroso. In September 2024, he made headlines for kissing Damon's wife's head during a Los Angeles outing — on the heels of Damon holding hands with Lopez. The “Tender Bar” star gushed, “That's sort of what a real friend is.”</p>

So much work needs to go on behind the scenes to make a project real,” says OBB Media founder and CEO Michael D. Ratner, who will also lead Fanatics Studios.

And it includes a major content deal with ESPN, which sees Fanatics Studios join the sports media giant and Full Day Production as a producer of the 2026 ESPY Awards. Fanatics Studios will also produce hours of additional content for ESPN over the next two years, including further installments of its Fanatics Fest docuseries, which debuted last year. Fanatics and OBB Media first joined forces for Fanatics Fest, the live event in New York that brings together sports and pop culture, with OBB producing the docuseries. They also previously announced plans for the Fanatics Flag Football Classic, which will be played in Saudi Arabia and will see Tom Brady come out of retirement. However, the company also said Tuesday that it was working on a docuseries following Brady as he comes out of retirement to play in the flag football event, and gears up to potentially make a push for the 2028 Olympics, where flag football will be a sport. “And we want to create big, sticky, repeatable franchises, formats that have annuity value, and the Flag Football Classic is a perfect example of that.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Beloved Singer and actress Sheila Bernette has died at the age of 94, a close friend has confirmed, as reported by The Daily Mail. Bernette enjoyed a long and varied career in British entertainment, becoming best known for her many appearances on the BBC's beloved music hall series “The Good Old Days.” For decades, she appeared on television, in film, and in live performance, bringing warmth, humor, and a natural stage presence to her work. She appeared regularly on “The Good Old Days” from 1968 to 1983, bringing Victorian and Edwardian-style songs and sketches to life for a new generation of viewers. Actor Peter Kosta announced Bernette's passing on Monday, January 12, calling her a cherished friend who brought “just fun and laughter” into his life. He spoke highly of her loyalty and support throughout his career, mentioning that she always encouraged him and attended his events whenever she could. “She always supported me in everything that I wanted to do, and always came to see me in everything I did, whenever she could. I have extremely fond memories of her,” he said. Kosta also reflected on a visit he made to Bernette shortly before her death. “I saw her for nearly two hours, and we were talking about the good old days,” he shared. The Daily Mail reported that the Royal Variety Charity paid tribute to Bernette in a statement, honoring her lasting impact on British entertainment. “Sheila will be very much missed by many of those who worked with her and those from the wider theatrical family,” the charity said. Later generations may remember her as Mrs Poshington, the hotel guest who never leaves, on the CBBC sitcom “Hotel Trubble,” where she appeared from 2008 to 2011. Her later film roles included “Three For All,” “Car Trouble,” and “Driving Aphrodite,” released in 2009, which marked her final film appearance. RIP Shelia🙏 her summer season in Paignton with Leslie Crowther moons ago was fun. Last time we had fish and chips at The Golden Hind, Marylebone.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 25-year-old breakout star spoke with the late night host about the HBO Max-Crave series, what it was like learning how to skate and speak Russian and how he's coping with his sudden fame. He started his appearance by taking it all in, smiling out at the cheering audience. He told Meyers, who commented about the actor's quick turnaround to make the show, that he left the Globes around 8 p.m., went to the Chateau Marmont for about 30 minutes to attend an after party (which included snapping a photo with Parker Posey) and then rushed off to catch a flight. HBO Max Inks Prime Video Deals for Germany, Italy Rollout 'Heated Rivalry' Costume Designer Talks Creating Style for Steamy Gay Hockey Drama: "It's a Little Bit Queer Coded" “You think of male romance, you think it's for gay men but there's been all walks of life, predominately women, who enjoy it,” he said, smiling out at the cheering audience. Connor Storrie only had two weeks to become a pro on the ice 🏒 pic.twitter.com/dYs1dYfsLY I thought I was doing good and then recently one of our costume designers Hanna posted BTS of me skating,” Storrie recalled when asked if he felt better about his skating abilities. “If Heated Rivalry didn't go this well, I was already planning on getting a new job in a few months,” he admitted. His “own things” is likely a reference to his directorial debut, which he's been enthusiastically sharing about during Heated Rivalry's press tour. The show had teased the interview with a parody of the show, showing Meyers trying to convince Storrie to come on Late Night and ending with a riff on Storrie's now-iconic cottage line. “I'm coming to Late Night,” Storrie said in his character Ilya's Russian accent. A large crowd gathered in front of NBC's 30 Rockefeller Center to get a peek at the actor arriving for his taping. It was a similar scene last week when Williams made his late night debut on The Tonight Show. Heated Rivalry, hailing from Canadian streamer Crave and airing on HBO Max in the U.S., was created for television by Letterkenny alum Jacob Tierney and centers around a fictional hockey universe based on books by Rachel Reid. The show focuses on two rival professional players — Canada-born Shane Hollander (Williams) of the fictitious Montreal Metros and Russia-born Ilya Rozanov (Storrie) of the fictitious Boston Raiders — as they navigate a near-decade-long situationship turned (spoiler alert) relationship over the entirety of their Major League Hockey careers. Crave renewed Heated Rivalry for a second season and HBO Max confirmed it will continue to air the series. Tierney, who wrote and directed the show's entire first season, has confirmed that he'll return to direct the series, but told THR ahead of Heated Rivalry's finale that he was considering the possibility “that other writers will come in to help” him out, but that he wasn't sure yet.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"If there are any MAGA left after THIS, you have made an irrevocable choice," the rocker wrote. Tom Morello is once again giving the Donald Trump administration heat, this time for using an alleged Nazi slogan at a recent news conference. Sharing an Instagram photo on Monday (Jan. 12) of U.S. Department of Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem addressing press a few days ago, the Rage Against the Machine musician (who also performs as The Nightwatchman) accused her of standing behind a podium that displayed a “verbatim” quote of a “Nazi mass murder slogan” on the front. “If there are any MAGA left after THIS, you have made an irrevocable choice.” When reached by Billboard for comment, the Department of Homeland Security responded: “Calling everything you dislike ‘Nazi propaganda' is tiresome. Billboard has also reached out to the White House for comment. Billboard has reached out to the museum for more information on whether “One of ours, all of yours” originated as Morello claims it did. The conference at which Noem stood behind a podium reading the statement took place on Jan. 8, one day after ICE officer Jonathan Ross shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, an unarmed U.S. citizen, during an immigration enforcement operation in Minneapolis. “Releasing this song now is in direct response to what we've seen happening, the state terror we've seen happening in this country of mass agents tearing families apart,” he told Billboard at the time. Though Rage officially disbanded in January 2024, the band was known for protesting oppressive systems of power through music.
