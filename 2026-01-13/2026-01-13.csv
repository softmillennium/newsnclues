            A storm of controversy has erupted on the eve of the Winter Olympics in Italy, after the Canadian women's skeleton team was accused of competition manipulation at the North American Cup in Lake Placid, New York.
    


            American slider Katie Uhlaender won the race on Sunday, but because four Canadian athletes had been withdrawn shortly before the competition, the field dropped to a size that reduced the number of ranking points available, effectively ending Uhlaender's hopes of qualifying for a sixth Olympic Games next month.
    


            Uhlaender believes that Canada's decision to reduce the size of the field was a deliberate strategy to try to benefit one of their own sliders from being passed in overall rankings, snagging another berth for the Canadian women's team at the Games. Other athletes were also impacted by the reduction in points available.
    


            In a statement to CNN Sports, Bobsleigh Canada Skeleton (BCS) vehemently denied accusations that the organization and its coach, Joe Cecchini, had intentionally altered its lineup to help Canadians earn another berth. Nonetheless, the decision to withdraw four Canadian athletes at late notice may have impacted the Olympic prospects of other competitors and possibly even the future careers of others.
    


            The sports' governing body, the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF), has told CNN Sports that the race in Lake Placid is now under investigation by its integrity unit.
    


            Uhlaender, a five-time Olympian and two-time world champion, said a minimum of 21 athletes needed to compete in Lake Placid for the maximum number of points to be awarded. Since only 19 sliders ended up competing, the points available were reduced. Four Canadian women, who had been entered to race, watched from the sidelines.
    


            “During the first official training day, where you qualify for the race, Canada decided to pull their athletes,” Uhlaender told CNN Sports. “They did it in a manner that gave the ruse that they were going to compete, that everything was fine, and it put everyone in a position where they could not go anywhere else to race. They reduced the points of the race intentionally. A lot of athletes were depending on this race to collect points and prepare for Olympic selections on January 18.”
    


            Uhlaender estimates that at least three to five athletes, including herself, could now miss the games in Italy as a result, but the loss of points could also impact next season's funding for some, potentially even forcing them into early retirement.
    


            “The entire field was negatively affected,” she said, comparing the sequence of events at Lake Placid to the biggest scourge in sports: doping.
    


            Bobsleigh Canada Skeleton refuted the accusations against their program, telling CNN in a statement that the change was intended to protect its younger athletes and ultimately allowed its two most experienced sliders to compete.
    


            “Decisions regarding competition participation are made on an ongoing basis,” the team said, “with careful consideration of athlete health, safety, and long-term development, as well as the needs of the program as a whole.
    


            “The Lake Placid event presented unique circumstances, as it consisted of three races in a single week rather than the standard two. Four of our athletes entered in the event are young and relatively new to the sport. All experienced a particularly challenging week on the track,” the statement said.

            The team in its statement recognized the “unintended impact on the size of the field” in its decision but said “it is well understood within the sport” that such events have flexible points awarded and are not a primary pathway for qualification.
    


            “Following a collective assessment by the coaching and performance team, it was determined that continuing to race these athletes was not in their best interests, nor in the best interests of the program,” the statement continued.
    


            An internal memo, purportedly from Cecchini to his athletes and provided to CNN Sports by multiple sources, suggests the point standings for some competitors was part of the calculus – be it innocuous or intended – in allowing for rest time.
    


            “Due to the current dynamics of Olympic qualification and the evolving points situation, the women will not be participating in the NAC Lake Placid,” read the memo.
    


            “The decision has been made to ensure that we have a complete and accurate understanding of the points landscape, qualification implications, and confirmed start numbers before proceeding. Once we have full clarity on these factors, participation will be determined in alignment with overall program priorities and the best interests of the national team.”
    


            CNN Sports has reached out to Cecchini for comment and the Canadian Olympic Committee referred CNN to the BCS statement.
    


            Other competing nations soon weighed in after the event. The head of Denmark's bobsled and skeleton federation criticized the move in a statement to The Canadian Press, calling the decision “the opposite of fair play.”

            USA Bobsled-Skeleton said in a statement that they are “committed to fair play and to protecting the rights of athletes. At the same time, we recognize the importance of maintaining positive and respectful international relationships within our sport. Our understanding is that the IBSF is currently reviewing the matter, and we will await their decision.”
    


            Uhlaender says she's been a friend of Cecchini's for 20 years. On hearing that the standing of the race in Lake Placid could be affected, Uhlaender says she contacted him via phone call to try and persuade him to change course, to no avail.
    


            “I genuinely wanted to understand what he was doing and why because I thought he was logical, I thought he was fair,” she explained. “And in this instance I couldn't understand it, and it felt like bullying.”
    


            Despite all the acrimony at Lake Placid, Uhlaender says it was uplifting to see the athletes come together, in support of each other.
    


            “Everyone cheered for every female athlete that was racing, but particularly we made sure to show the Canadian athletes love because we know it's not their fault. If their leadership is acting in this manner, it's imperative we look at that.”
    


            It remains to be seen whether her friendship with Cecchini will survive, but she says that she felt compelled to speak out.
    


            “This was a very difficult situation because not only did a friend of 20 years potentially nail the coffin at the end of my career, but they hurt a whole field of athletes at the same time. I don't want to betray my friend, but at the same time, the integrity of sport is something I have an obligation to uphold as a five-time Olympian,” she said.
    


            “I feel sport reflects societal values and at times our stage is where people turn to. I feel at the end of my career it's my duty to represent what I believe in, the integrity of sport and the Olympic movement.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","‘Are You Dead?' app goes viral in China (VIDEO)","https://www.rt.com/news/630914-are-you-dead-app/","Tue, 13 Jan 2026 13:58:00 GMT","

An app that requires people living alone to regularly confirm they are alive has reportedly become the top paid download on Apple's App Store in China, underscoring rising social concerns driven by the country's rapid demographic shift.

The app, known as ‘Si Le Ma' in Chinese (translated as “Are You Dead?” in English), functions as a digital check-in system. The app costs 8 yuan, or about $1.15, to download. Launched in mid-2025, it saw downloads surge only in early January, according to Chinese media reports. Users must press a button to signal they are safe, and if they fail to do so for two consecutive days, the app automatically sends an alert to a pre-selected emergency contact.

Its rise in popularity coincides with two overlapping trends: a growing number of young Chinese choosing to live alone rather than marry and have children, and an expanding elderly population increasingly left isolated without nearby family support.

One of the app's three young co-creators, who identified himself only as Lyu, told local media it was aimed at young people living alone in major cities, particularly women around the age of 25.

Such users were likely to “experience a strong sense of loneliness due to the lack of people to communicate with… accompanied by… worries about unforeseen events occurring without anyone knowing,” he said.

China recorded its third consecutive year of population decline in 2024 and in 2023 lost its status as the world's most populous country to India.

As fertility drops, life expectancy lengthens, marriages decline, and divorce rates continue to rise, these factors are creating a trend of ‘one-person households', said Wei-Jun Jean Yeung, a social demography expert at the National University of Singapore, as quoted by the Financial Times, adding that the concern was real.

China could have as many as 200 million one-person households by 2030, with more than 30% of the population living alone, according to projections published in 2021 by property research firm Beike Research Institute.

A separate government survey conducted in 2021 found that nearly 60% of Chinese aged 60 and above lived alone or only with a spouse, up about 10 percentage points from 2010.

External deep-state forces were instrumental in instigating the September 2025 violence in Nepal that led to the ouster of the government, its former foreign minister has told RT India.

K.P. Sharma Oli resigned as Nepal's prime minister after violent clashes – known as the Gen Z protests – killed 77 and injured more than 2,000.  Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, a former foreign minister, has now backed Oli's assertion that Gen Z protests that led to the ouster of the government were backed by external forces.

“Those elements who were actively engaged with the deep state, who used the cross-border misinformation and disinformation to instigate the violence, they were active,” he told RT India in an exclusive interview.

The remarks came after Oli told RT India about external influences in the uprising last year.

Gyawali said Kathmandu's growing engagement with India and China and its aspiration of being a bridge for the economic development of Nepal between the two neighboring countries “was not a very good message to some powers.”

He added, “[They] wanted to use Nepal's geostrategic location for their policy in their favor. So maybe our engagement with our neighboring countries may have some grievances to the big powers as well.”

The Grayzone has cited leaked documents to reveal that the US government's National Endowment for Democracy (NED) had spent hundreds of thousands of dollars tutoring Nepalese young people to stage the protests. 

The Gen Z protests happened as the US sought to neutralize Chinese and Indian influence over Kathmandu, Grayzone investigations revealed.

The NED is officially a US State Department-funded nonprofit that provides grants to support ‘democratic initiatives' worldwide.

The International Republican Institute (IRI), a NED division, has been accused of funding clandestine activities in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, apart from funneling tens of millions of dollars to Ukrainian political entities and anti-Russian interests.

The Nigerian Army rescued all 18 passengers, including two infants, after a passenger boat was hijacked by suspected sea pirates on Sunday. 

According to the statement published by the Nigerian Army on X, the boat was traveling from Nigeria to Cameroon along the Kombo Fishing Port axis when raiders operating two speedboats and a wooden boat intercepted it.  

Military sources say the 13th Brigade of the Nigerian Army received a distress call after the hijacking and deployed troops to pursue the attackers. An exchange of gunfire followed during which one of the pirates' speedboats capsized.  

After the capsizing, the attackers abandoned the captives and fled into nearby creeks, according to the army. 

“All passengers were rescued unharmed,” the statement said. 

Brigadier General P.O. Alimikhena praised the troops for acting quickly and professionally. “This successful rescue operation demonstrates the courage, professionalism, and unwavering commitment of our men and women to protect lives and ensure the safety of our waterways,” he said as quoted by the army's press service on X.  

Piracy and armed robbery at sea have long been security concerns in the Gulf of Guinea, a key maritime trade route that stretches across West and Central Africa, which is bordered by countries such as Nigeria, Cameroon, Ghana, Benin, Togo, and Equatorial Guinea.

According to the International Maritime Bureau (IMB), reported maritime piracy and armed robbery incidents increased in the Gulf of Guinea in 2025 compared with the same period in 2024. IMB's January–September 2025 report recorded 15 incidents in the region, up from 12 in the first nine months of 2024, including both armed robbery in territorial waters and piracy at sea. 

In April, pirates raided a tanker off the coast of Nigeria, although the crew was not harmed. Four armed individuals remained on board for nearly four hours, during which they stole the personal belongings of the crew and equipment from the vessel before fleeing.

Four leaders left civil rights division while FBI presses on with inquiry into victim Renee Nicole Good

Four of the leaders of a crucial division in the US justice department have resigned in protest over a decision not to investigate the recent fatal shooting of an unarmed US citizen by a federal immigration agent in Minneapolis – even as the FBI presses ahead with an inquiry into the victim instead.

The lawyers left the civil rights division, which has a criminal investigations unit that investigates the use of force by police officers, according to MS Now, citing three people it said were briefed about the departures.

It follows a decision by Harmeet Dhillon, the Trump administration-aligned assistant attorney general for civil rights, not to investigate the 7 January killing of Renee Nicole Good by Jonathan Ross, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent, as would be usual in the case of a shooting by law enforcement.

Dhillon told the unit the week before that it would not be involved in any investigation, Reuters reported a source as saying.

A justice department spokesperson confirmed the resignations in a statement to the Guardian but denied they were related to the Minneapolis shooting.

“Although we typically don't comment on personnel matters, we can confirm that the criminal section leadership gave notice to depart the civil rights division and requested to participate in the Department of Justice's early retirement program well before the events in Minnesota,” the statement said. “Any suggestion to the contrary is false.”

Separately, the FBI – which seized total control of the investigation after freezing out local officials – is looking into Good's “possible connections to activist groups”, according to the New York Times.

A succession of Trump administration officials, including the president himself, have portrayed Good, without presenting evidence, as a “domestic terrorist” or “paid agitator” – while video of her confrontation with Ross appears to show her trying to steer her vehicle away from him when she was shot three times in the face.

Multiple career prosecutors in Dhillon's office offered to lead an inquiry into the shooting but were told not to do so, CBS News reported on Friday.

The resignations are the latest in a flow of departures from the civil rights division since Donald Trump began his second term a year earlier. In May, the Guardian reported that more than 250 attorneys had left, been reassigned, or accepted a deferred resignation offer since January, a roughly 70% reduction.

Dhillon, a former Republican official in California, and an election denier who promoted the “big lie” that Trump's 2020 election defeat was fraudulent, was confirmed by the Senate in April. She worked quickly to realign the division's priorities away from its longstanding work tackling discrimination and protecting the rights of marginalized groups – and towards Trump's political goals including exposing voter fraud, which is rare, and focusing on anti-transgender issues.

“I don't think it's an overstatement to see this as the end of the division as we've known it,” a civil rights division attorney told the Guardian at the time.

Subsequently, in September, the online news outlet Notus reported that only two lawyers remained out of 36 at the justice department's public integrity unit assigned to investigations of corrupt politicians and law enforcement.

“Investigating officials to determine if they broke the law, defied policy, failed to de-escalate, and resorted to deadly force without basis is one of the civil rights division's most solemn duties,” Kristen Clarke, who led the division in the Biden administration, told MS Now.

“Prosecutors of the civil rights division have, for decades, been the nation's leading experts in this work.”

The FBI investigation into Good's alleged links to activist groups protesting ICE activities in Minneapolis and elsewhere, meanwhile, aligns with White House messaging seeking to blame the victim for her death and absolve the ICE agent of responsibility.

In the days since Good's killing, numerous Trump administration officials, including Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, have repeatedly alleged without evidence that she was engaging in domestic terrorism – and that Ross was forced to shoot to save his own life and the lives of others. Good, Noem said, had been “stalking” officers.

JD Vance, the vice-president, repeated the claims in an angry rant during a White House press briefing on Thursday, alleging Good was part of a “broader leftwing network” working tirelessly and using “domestic terror techniques” to stop the Trump administration from enforcing immigration laws. He offered no evidence to back up his claim.

Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Trump published a post on his Truth Social platform asking: “Do the people of Minnesota really want to live in a community where there are thousands of … deadly criminals too dangerous to even mention.”

Family members say Good, a mother of three children, had just dropped her six-year-old son off at school. And video shows her waving ICE vehicles past her car despite the insistence of Vance and others that she was deliberately blocking traffic and “impeding” their work.

“This is classic terrorism,” Vance said.

Officials in Minneapolis have contradicted the administration's assertions and condemned its rush to judgment before an investigation had taken place.

“They're calling the victim a domestic terrorist. They're calling the actions of the agent involved as some form of defensive posture. We know that they've already determined much of the investigation,” the city's mayor, Jacob Frey, said in a press conference on Friday.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Yoon is on trial for insurrection charges, after trying to declare martial law in late 2024

South Korean prosecutors have demanded the death penalty for former president Yoon Suk Yeol over his failed martial law declaration in December 2024, in the first insurrection trial of a Korean head of state in three decades.

Prosecutors characterised the case as the “serious destruction of constitutional order by anti-state forces”, telling Seoul central district court that Yoon had “directly and fundamentally infringed upon the safety of the state and the survival and freedom of the people”.

Under South Korea's criminal code, insurrection ringleader charges carry just three possible sentences: the death penalty, life imprisonment with labour, or life imprisonment without labour. A verdict is expected in mid-February.

Prosecutors demanded life imprisonment with labour for the former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun, describing him as having “moved as one body” with Yoon throughout the conspiracy.

Yoon deployed troops to the national assembly on the night of 3 December 2024, allegedly ordering them to prevent lawmakers from voting to lift his martial law declaration.

The six-hour crisis ended when 190 MPs broke through military cordons to pass an emergency resolution, forcing Yoon to back down. Parliament impeached him on 14 December, and the constitutional court removed him from office in April 2025.

A snap election brought Yoon's rival, Lee Jae Myung, to power.

Prosecutors told the court Yoon began planning the operation before October 2023 to “monopolise power through long-term rule”, strategically placing military personnel in key positions before the declaration.

According to their closing arguments the plans, documented in notebooks and mobile phone memos, included preparing to torture election officials into confessing to fabricated election fraud, and cutting power and water to critical media outlets.

“If just one [cabinet member] had informed the outside world … the implementation of martial law would have been realistically impossible,” prosecutors said, condemning senior officials who “chose loyalty to Yoon and greed for power-sharing”, threatening people's lives and freedom.

They cited Yoon's complete lack of remorse as a key aggravating factor, noting he has never properly apologised and instead blames the then-opposition while inciting supporters. Some of those supporters stormed a courthouse in violent protests following his arrest.

Yoon, a former prosecutor general, was fully aware the declaration was unconstitutional, they said.

In a statement, the presidential office said the judiciary would deliver a verdict in accordance with laws and principles, and in line with the public's expectations.

The case marks the first insurrection-related charges against a former president since the 1996 trial of military dictators Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo for their roles in the 1979 coup and subsequent massacre in Gwangju.

Prosecutors then demanded death for Chun and life imprisonment for Roh. Both were convicted, though their sentences were later reduced and they were ultimately pardoned.

South Korea has not executed anyone since 1997 and is classified as a “de facto abolitionist” state by human rights groups.

Yoon was first arrested in January 2025, making him the first sitting Korean president to be taken into custody. He was briefly released in March after a court cancelled his detention, but was re-arrested in July and has been held since.

The insurrection case represents just one piece of an unprecedented legal onslaught.

Three concurrent special prosecutor probes into Yoon, his wife, and the alleged cover-up of a marine's death have indicted more than 120 people across the political and military establishment.

Yoon faces eight separate criminal trials spanning charges from abuse of power to election law violations.

Beyond the insurrection charge, he is accused of ordering drone infiltrations into Pyongyang airspace in late 2024 to provoke North Korea and create a pretext for martial law.

His wife, Kim Keon Hee, faces her own reckoning on 28 January, when another Seoul court will rule on stock manipulation and bribery charges carrying a prosecutorial demand of 15 years imprisonment.

Yoon's first verdict arrives on 16 January in his arrest obstruction case, where prosecutors have demanded 10 years imprisonment.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The Port of Kaohsiung was rated as one of the world's top 10 container ports last year, despite a decrease in the number of containers it handled, Taiwan International Ports Corp (TIPC) said yesterday.

The rating was conducted by Det Norske Veritas (DNV), an international accredited registrar and classification society based in Hovik, Norway.

The Port of Kaohsiung was ranked ninth by the Norwegian agency.

The nation's largest international seaport last year handled 8.886 million twenty-foot-equivalent units (TEUs), down 3.17 percent from 2024, ranking 20th in terms of the container volume handled.

The port operator attributed the decline in container throughput at the port to disruptions in the global supply chain caused by US tariffs.

DNV ranked international seaports around the world based on five key indicators: productivity, sustainability, connectivity and customer value, overall impact and enablers.

Combined container throughput at TIPC's ports in Kaohsiung, Keelung, Taichung, Tainan, Hualien and Suao (蘇澳) in Yilan County fell to 13.51 million TEUs last year from 13.92 million TEUs in 2024.

Despite the decrease, the company reported record-high revenue of NT$23.53 billion (US$743.3 million) last year, a 3.2 percent increase from 2024, TIPC chairman Chou Yung-hui (周永暉) said.

The year-end bonuses that TIPC employees would receive is expected to be the equivalent of 4.4 months of their salaries, pending a final decision by the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, the company said.

TIPC also reported a significant rise in the number of cruise ships and cruise ship travelers arriving in the nation last year.

It said that 567 cruise ships made port calls, bringing in 1.15 million travelers, surpassing 1.05 million travelers in 2019.

Forty-one percent of the travelers last year were foreigners, up from 35 percent in 2024, company data showed.

The international travelers were primarily from Japan (27.16 percent), the US (17.37 percent), Hong Kong (10.76 percent), South Korea (9.28 percent) and Germany (6.21 percent), the data showed.

About 60,000 foreign travelers arrived through the “fly-cruise” model, where they fly to a port city to embark on a cruise, the data showed.

Most of the travelers who arrived through the fly-cruise model were from the US, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and Canada, the data showed.

Cruise ships making port calls last year were more diverse compared with those arriving before the COVID-19 pandemic, TIPC said.

Before the pandemic, 90 percent of the cruise ships docking at the Port of Keelung were “contemporary” cruise ships, while “premium,” “luxury” and “expedition” cruise ships accounted for only 2.7 percent, 5.7 percent and 1 percent respectively, it said.

However, contemporary cruise ships making port calls fell to 78.08 percent last year, while premium, luxury and expedition cruise ships rose to 7.76 percent, 12.79 percent and 1.37 percent respectively, it said.

The company has established a cruise ship marketing division in light of the increases, while its branch office in Keelung is to launch a cruise ship business development department on July 1, Chou said.

“Aside from consolidating the number of cruise ship arrivals at the Port of Keelung from Japan and South Korea, we want to expand the numbers arriving at the Port of Kaohsiung from the Philippines and Vietnam this year,” he said. “We would also work closely with the Tourism Administration, and the Maritime and Port Bureau to boost domestic island-hopping tours.”

Separately, AirlineRatings.com yesterday released its list of the world's safest flight carriers, with EVA Airways and Starlux Airlines included.

EVA Air, ranked eighth overall, made the list for the 13th consecutive year and was the only Taiwanese airline in the global top 10 for safety, while Starlux was 11th overall.

Posting on the social media platform Threads yesterday, a user said that an employee at the store said that “those shoes are very expensive” when her friend, who is a migrant worker from Vietnam, asked for assistance.
The employee then ignored her until she asked again, to which she replied: ""We don't have a size 37.""

Taiwanese airline EVA Air was ranked No. 8 on the world's safest full-service airlines for 2026 by AirlineRatings.com, while Starlux Airlines was ranked 11th, the airline rating website announced Tuesday.

EVA Air President Sun Chia-ming (孫嘉明) said the carrier has been ranked among the world's safest airlines for the 13th consecutive year, adding that the recognition is an affirmation of its employees' commitment to safety culture and adherence to standard operating procedures.

He said that the company will continue to improve its safety management systems and enhance risk prevention mechanisms.

Commenting on its first inclusion in the rankings, rival carrier Starlux said the recognition reflects its employees' dedication to flight safety and their rigorous execution of every operational detail.

Noting its relatively short five-year operating history, the airline cited the ranking website's assessment that its inclusion was exceptional for such a young carrier, praising Starlux for an approach to safety and transparency that it described as ""exceptional.""

The top 10 safest full-service airlines (as opposed to low- cost airlines) are Etihad of the United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific, Australia's Qantas, Qatar Airways, Emirates of the UAE, Air New Zealand, Singapore Airlines, EVA Air, Virgin Australia and Korean Air, according to AirlineRatings.com.

Boasting as the world's only airline safety and product rating website, the rankings consider incident rates adjusted for the total number of flights, fleet age, serious incidents, pilot training and international safety audits, according to the website, which added that airline transparency is also critical to the process.

It noted that it is placing greater emphasis on turbulence prevention this year, as it is the main cause of in-flight injuries.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

Russia is ""going all in"" to destroy Ukraine's energy infrastructure after the second mass attack in less than a week, Deputy Energy Minister Mykola Kolisnyk said on Jan. 13.

""Today, the enemy launched an attack with an interval of no more than five days after the previous one... we see that the enemy is going all-in, spending all its forces and means to destroy the energy system,"" Kolisnyk said in comments reported by Liga.net.

Around 70% of Kyiv is without electricity after yet another Russian mass strike overnight on Jan. 13, with Ukrenergo, the state-owned grid operator, saying Moscow's forces aim to ""disconnect the city.""

Already facing chronic power shortages in freezing temperatures forecast to plunge as low as -22 in the coming days, the latest attack comes just four days after the last mass assault on civilian infrastructure. 

Ballistic missile explosions rocked Ukraine's capital at around 1:10 a.m. local time on Jan. 13, according to Kyiv Independent journalists on the ground. Additional explosions were also heard around 8:30 a.m. local time.

The Kyiv suburbs of Bucha, Hostomel, and Irpin were reportedly left without power and running water following Russian strikes. Emergency power outages have also largely been implemented in Kyiv and parts of Kyiv Oblast, Ukrenergo reported.

""The Russians are trying to disconnect the city and force people to move outside (Kyiv),"" Vitaliy Zaichenko, Ukrenergo CEO, told the Kyiv Independent, saying a number of substations had been hit overnight and ""70% of Kyiv is without electricity.""

""We have information that Russia is ready to start the next wave of attacks with cruise missiles,"" he added.

DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy company, said its thermal power plant was attacked again, with equipment at the facility damaged as a result of the strike. The company noted that this was the eighth attack on its thermal power plants since October last year.

Supermarket chains Novus and Silpo announced they would be closing some stores in the capital due to the energy crisis. Later on Jan. 13, Kyiv authorities said the city's electric tram service was being replaced with buses.

According to Ukraine's Air Force, Russia launched 18 ballistic missiles, seven cruise missiles, as well as 293 Shahed-type drones. Energy infrastructure in Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts was also targeted.

A combined missile and drone attack on the outskirts of Kharkiv killed at least four people and injured six others, regional authorities reported on Jan. 13.

Previously, overnight on Jan. 9, Russia launched a mass missile and drone attack, killing 4 and injuring 24 others in Kyiv. In the aftermath, Ukraine's capital was left without electricity, heating, and running water just as some of the winter's coldest days approached.

Immediately following the attack, approximately 6,000 buildings in the city were left without power. As of Jan. 12, about 800 residential buildings remain without electricity as crews work to restore power, according to Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko.

""Maybe this wasn't the worst attack, but this is the worst impact we've seen. Compared to all previous winters, the situation now is the worst,"" Olena Pavlenko, president of the Kyiv-based energy-focused think tank DiXi Group, told the Kyiv Independent.

Our top stories today:

What we're covering now on the War Desk:

Russian troops have in recent days inched forward near small settlements in eastern and southern Ukraine, according to DeepState, a Ukrainian open-source analysis group.

The latest reported advance was near two villages in northern Donetsk Oblast on Jan. 13: Shandryholove and Sviato-Pokrovske.

In Shandryholove, a village with a listed population of 1,035 near the town of Lyman, DeepState's map shows Russian forces expanding their control and appearing to form a small pocket west of the settlement.

In Sviato-Pokrovske, which had 542 residents in the 2001 census and is near the town of Siversk, the mapped area of Russian control shifted farther into the village center, also suggesting a small pocket.

The villages are part of a wider fight in northern Donetsk, where small map changes often reflect slow pushes along tree lines and local roads rather than a major breakthrough.

Fighting around Lyman has remained intense. On Dec. 18, Ukraine's Third Army Corps said Ukrainian forces counterattacked near the city, destroying what it described as an entire Russian regiment — roughly 2,000 troops on paper.

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the reported changes.

Russian Belgorod Oblast Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov urged residents on Jan. 13 to be prepared to temporarily relocate as power and heating outages hit the border region near Ukraine, saying officials were drawing up contingency plans in case the situation worsens.

""In no way am I saying that we need to abandon all our belongings and start moving to another region. Absolutely not. What we need to do is understand the sequence of our actions in the event of a complex, emergency situation, when there might be no heat or electricity,"" Gladkov said in comments posted on Telegram.

Gladkov said officials were considering moving residents to other municipalities that could accommodate large numbers of people, or relocating them to other regions if necessary. He also urged families to send children to relatives ""where there is heat and electricity"" if they have that option.

The remarks come after Russian officials blamed Ukrainian strikes on Jan 9 for a large-scale power outage in the border region. The alleged attack followed a series of alleged Ukrainian attacks on Belgorod's energy infrastructure in recent months.

On Dec. 14, Gladkov said a missile attack caused ""serious damage"" to local engineering infrastructure.

He claimed that Ukrainian attacks on Nov. 8 cut power to more than 20,000 people, and on Oct. 5, he said an attack damaged energy facilities in the city and left nearly 40,000 residents without electricity.

Earlier, on Sept. 28, Russian Telegram channels reported a HIMARS strike on a thermal power plant near Belgorod, and Gladkov later said the attack hit ""critical infrastructure"" and caused ""significant power outages.""

The Kyiv Independent has noted it cannot independently verify Russian claims about the strikes and their impact.

Ukraine, meanwhile, has suffered far more severe and sustained power and heating cuts since Russia launched its campaign of strikes on energy infrastructure, including outages affecting hundreds of thousands in Kyiv and over 1 million people in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast this month alone, according  Ukrainian officials.

Since 2022-23, roughly half of Ukraine's power generation capacity has been occupied, destroyed, or damaged, the International Energy Agency has said.

Unidentified drones hit three Greek-managed oil tankers in the Black Sea on Jan. 13 as the ships headed to load crude at a terminal on Russia's coast near Novorossiysk, Reuters reported. 

Reuters said the ships were the Delta Harmony and Delta Supreme, both run by the Greek company Delta Tankers, and the Matilda, run by the Greek firm Thenamaris and hired by a subsidiary of Kazakhstan's state oil company KazMunayGas, citing sources and shipping data.

Thenamaris confirmed Matilda was hit by two drones about 30 miles (48 km) and said there were no injuries and damage was minor and repairable, according to Reuters. Two maritime security sources told Reuters a fire was reported on Matilda but quickly extinguished.

It was not immediately clear who was behind the strikes. The Kyiv Independent reached out to Ukraine's Security Services (SBU) but not receive a response by publication time. 

Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) has said it has used both Sea Baby naval drones and arial drones to strike Russian ""shadow fleet"" tankers and oil infrastructure in the Black Sea, including attacks on two sanctioned tankers off Turkey's coast on Nov. 28, 2025, and on the Caspian Pipeline Consortium's marine terminal near Novorossiysk the next day.

Former U.S. Federal Reserve leaders and some sitting Republican politicians lined up behind the beleaguered Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Monday, calling the Trump administration's criminal investigation into the central bank's leader an example of coercion reminiscent of an emerging market economy. 

Financial markets largely shrugged off concerns about eroding Fed independence, while some economists and former central bankers warned against complacency and suggested that a loss of confidence in the Fed could bleed across the border into Canada and rattle global markets.

On Sunday evening, Mr. Powell released an extraordinary video explaining that the U.S. Department of Justice had served the central bank with subpoenas threatening a criminal indictment. 

Fed Chair Jerome Powell issued a video statement in which he bluntly characterized the threat of criminal charges against him as simple 'pretexts' to undermine the Fed's independence when it comes to setting interest rates.

The inquiry centres on cost overruns on renovations of two Fed buildings in Washington, and Mr. Powell's testimony to Congress about the project. 

But Mr. Powell dismissed this as a pretext. U.S. President Donald Trump has spent months harrying him and his colleagues in an effort to exert more control over the independent central bank and push it to lower interest rates.

A statement published Monday and signed by 14 former central bankers and government officials, including every living former Fed chair – Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen – excoriated the Trump administration.

“The reported criminal inquiry into Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell is an unprecedented attempt to use prosecutorial attacks to undermine that independence,” the statement said. 

“This is how monetary policy is made in emerging markets with weak institutions, with highly negative consequences for inflation and the functioning of their economies more broadly.” 

Trump administration threatens to indict Fed Chair Jerome Powell

Three sitting Republican senators – Thom Tillis, Lisa Murkowski and Kevin Cramer – also expressed concern about the administration's move, suggesting that Mr. Trump may face opposition from his own party if he attempts to ram through a nominee to replace Mr. Powell, whose term as chair ends in May, or tries to stack the Fed board with cronies. 

Ms. Murkowski, a senator from Alaska, said in an online statement that she spoke with Mr. Powell on Monday and viewed the criminal investigation as “nothing more than an attempt at coercion.” 

The investigation is a significant escalation in Mr. Trump's attempt to exert control over the Fed – the world's most important central bank and the linchpin of global finance. 

His administration has also launched a criminal investigation into Fed governor Lisa Cook, who sits on the 12-member Federal Open Market Committee that sets U.S. interest rates. Mr. Trump has placed close ally Stephen Miran on the Fed's board of governors on an interim basis. 

BoC's Macklem says U.S. Fed Chair Powell has his ‘full support'

These apparent attempts to intimidate Fed officials and exert more control over monetary policy have raised concern among economists, who widely regard a central bank's ability to set interest rates independent of political pressure as essential for maintaining low and stable inflation. 

“History shows that central banks with operational independence are more successful at delivering price stability for their citizens,” Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem said in a statement on Monday. 

“I reiterate my full support for Federal Reserve Board Chair Jay Powell, who reflects the very best in public service. Chair Powell is doing a very good job under difficult circumstances, guiding the Fed to take monetary policy decisions based on evidence, not politics,” Mr. Macklem said. 

Financial markets appeared largely unmoved on Monday by the drama unfolding in Washington. Gold jumped, as usually happens amid uncertainty, and the U.S. dollar weakened against other currencies. But stock markets rose and bond markets remained relatively stable, with long-term yields rising slightly. 

“If you didn't know about the announcement, you would think the market moves were just part of a normal daily volatility,” Beata Caranci, chief economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said in an interview. 

Investors anxious over make-or-break fight for the Fed

There's a rationale for this relative calm, she said. While there's no doubt Mr. Trump will replace Mr. Powell with a more dovish chair amenable to his vision for lower interest rates, the chair is only one of 12 voting members on the committee that sets rates, and may have a hard time winning over other members to an inflationary policy. 

Likewise, a more dovish Fed might be checked by financial markets, said Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. If investors begin to expect higher inflation, they'll push up long-term bond yields, countering Mr. Trump's desire for lower mortgage rates. (Central banks only control short-term interest rates; long-term rates are set in the bond market.) 

“There is a possibility that the Fed gets a little bit too aggressive with rate cuts, led by a new chair who pushes it that way. But the bond market does have, in effect, a bit of a veto power,” Mr. Shenfeld said in an interview. 

“Because if long-term interest rates start to climb on fear of inflation, it's going to be a big stop sign in front of the Fed. No one's going to vote for deep short-term rate cuts that are going to push mortgage rates higher.”

Former Bank of Canada deputy governor Tim Lane, however, said that it's important not to get complacent about the erosion of Fed independence.

‘It is not good': What the Street is saying as Trump-Fed feud escalates

The past two decades have several examples of central banks losing their independence to populist governments and pursuing reckless inflationary policies to finance government spending, most notably in Argentina and Turkey. 

“I think there's generally a perception that, ‘Well, this could never happen in the U.S.' But there may come a time when that view becomes too sharply in conflict with the facts as they emerge, and at that point, you could see a pretty abrupt correction in the markets,” Mr. Lane said in an interview. 

A Fed inclined toward lower interest rates could impact Canada in a number of ways, he said. The Canadian dollar would likely appreciate against the U.S. dollar, helping importers but hurting exporters. Long-term bond yields, which underpin mortgage interest rates, would likely rise in conjunction with higher U.S. bond yields. 

The biggest risk, Mr. Lane said, is that investors lose faith in a politically compromised Fed, causing cracks in the global financial system. 

“The U.S. dollar is really the anchor of the global financial system, and there's a whole lot of expectations and conventions … that reinforce that. It can hold for a long time, that confidence. But if it's lost, it can happen very suddenly and that could be a pretty major shock for Canada and for the world in general,” he said.

Schools in many parts of Germany have closed their doors following warnings of extremely icy conditions. Meanwhile, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has started his first state visit to India.

This blog is now closed. It was a roundup of the top news stories from and about Germany on Monday, January 12:

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul met World Bank President Ajay Banga in Washington on Monday ahead of talks with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. 

Sources from Wadephul's delegation speaking with the dpa news agency said the foreign minister assured Banga of the German government's continued support of the World Bank. 

""Germany particularly welcomes the World Bank's support for Ukraine's reform agenda and encourages it to continue to play an active role in this regard,"" Wadephul said, according to his delegation. 

The World Bank is a key institution involved in financing reconstruction. Germany is the fourth-largest shareholder of the World Bank behind the US, China, and Japan. 

Talks with Rubio later Monday are expected to include the Trump administration's ongoing threats to seize Greenland.

Also on the agenda is like the status of consultations on security guarantees for Ukraine.

Wadephul's next stop is expected to be in New York for talks with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, coming as the US announced that it will withdraw from 66 international organizations.

Lars Klingbeil, Germany's finance minister and vice chancellor, said Monday that he is deeply worried about the fragile state of relations between Germany, Europe and the US, noting that he has ""major concerns"" with Washington under the leadership of President Donald Trump.

Klingbeil, in the US for meetings with fellow finance ministers, said he was keen to use the opportunity to discuss his concerns with colleagues. Still, Klingbeil admitted these ""discussions are becoming more difficult, the differences are getting bigger"" adding, ""it is bad for the world if Europe and the US are driven apart.""

Trump and his administration's unrelenting attacks on traditional US allies have triggered panic among transatlantic partners, especially as the president targetsNATO nations and has gone so far as to repeatedly threaten to take Greenland from NATO-partner Denmark by force if necessary — something observers warn would be the death of the military alliance as well as the rules-based world order that the US worked so hard to establish after the end of the Second World War.  

""Germany's solidarity is completely clear: We need state sovereignty, territorial integrity. And that is a common signal that we Europeans make clear to the US administration time and again.""

German Interior MinisterAlexander Dobrindt on Monday announced plans to deploy more domestic intelligence officers in the fight against left-wing extremism.

Dobrindt's remarks came during an annual conference of the civil servants' association in Cologne.
 
""The domestic intelligence service will be reinforced,"" said the Bavarian conservative, adding, ""I simply do not want to give left-wing extremism any space in our country.""
 
Dobrindt promised that the shift in focus would not mean pulling resources away from battling right-wing extremism.

The interior minister says left-wing terrorism and left-wing extremism are gaining steam in Germany and operating ""at a higher pace.""

Recently, a left-wing extremist group claimed responsibility for an attack on a Berlin power station that left some 100,000 people without heat or electricity for several days in sub-freezing temperatures.
 
In announcing the new posture, Dobrindt said, ""I simply do not find it acceptable that the state is still blind in some areas to extremists.""

Two children in the southwestern German state of Rhineland-Palatinate made a gruesome discovery while rummaging around in the bushes between a playground and a nearby set of train tracks in the city of Worms on Sunday afternoon.

It was there that the children stumbled upon a human skull.

Police were notified and arrived at the scene shortly thereafter.

Upon combing the area, officers located more human skeletal remains.

Authorities say it is unclear whether the remains found Sunday are tied to foul play or can be traced back to a missing individual, saying that they hope to come to a definitive determination within the coming weeks.

Germany's Federal Statistics Office on Monday announced that the nation had seen a 15.2% annual increase in bankruptcies in December 2025. The metric stood at 5.7% in November.

The number was compiled from court filings and may not represent a final tally as some cases remain pending.

Although government statisticians did not offer overall annual numbers, researchers at the Leibniz Institute for Economic Research in Halle (IWH), Germany, recently estimated that the number of corporate bankruptcies in 2025 was 17,604, the highest number in 20 years. 

IWH economists said data suggests businesses failed due to lingering COVID-era issues as well as interest rate policy.

Veterinarians in Germany are calling for an immediate end to the practice of tethering cattle in stalls according to a letter seen by the French news agency AFP. 

In the open letter, some 350 animal specialists demand Agriculture Minister Alois Rainer ""end the suffering"" of cows that can do no more than lie or stand but are otherwise unable to move due to the practice. 

Roughly 1 million cattle are held this way in Germany, mainly in southern Germany according to the letter, which criticizes the fact that they can be confined this way their entire lives.

Veterinarians say the technique harms animals physically and psychologically. Their letter criticizes the fact that the current government has blocked efforts to pass a federal tethering ban.

Those veterinarians who signed the letter say it is their professional and ethical duty to stop the ""unnecessary suffering"" of animals.

An international team of researchers is using a remote-controlled, lighter-than-air dirigible to collect, measure and map air-quality above the German Alps with an eye to reducing deadly aerosol pollution worldwide. WATCH:

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Monday condemned violence employed by Iranian leadership against its own citizens as ""brutal"" and ""disproportionate.""

Merz praised the bravery of Iranians from all walks of life who have ""peacefully"" stood up to call for ""freedom and a better life,"" saying it was ""their right"" to demand improvement.

""I call on the Iranian leadership to protect its population instead of threatening it,"" Merz said. Adding, ""We condemn the violence that the leadership in Tehran is directing against its own people in the strongest terms.""

Moreover, in demanding ""this violence must end,"" the German leader said the brutal repression meted out by Tehran's hardline theocratic leaders was ""a sign of weakness, not a sign of strength.""

Mass protests across the Islamic Republic over the past two weeks have been met with ruthless police force. 

Tens of thousands of people are thought to have been arrested over the past several days and hundreds have been rumored killed. 

Verification of these claims is currently impossible as Iran's religious leaders have imposed a nationwide internet and telecommunications blackout.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul will meet US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington on Monday, where the two will discuss ongoing support for the defense of Ukraine, security in the Arctic, and continued US threats to take possession of Greenland.

Residents and politicians in Greenland — a semi-autonomous territory in the North Atlantic belonging to the kingdom of Denmark — and Denmark have become incensed at the open manner with which US President Donald Trump has publicly contemplated taking over the frozen territory.

Germany, like almost all of the United States' NATO partners, has been shocked that Washington would seek to publicly coerce a partner into ceding control of its destiny to the Trump administration.

Before departing for the US, Wadephul spoke of US obligations to uphold the rights of freedom and self-determination among partner nations. He also addressed Germany's desire to increase its contributions to military security in the Arctic, pointing out that Berlin already provides forces engaged in maritime surveillance.

Wadephul will travel to New York after his meeting with Rubio. There he will speak with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, where the two will discuss, among other things, the recent US withdrawal from some 66 international organizations.

The US claims the international bodies — many having to do with democracy, equality and the environment — do not comply with US national interests.

Dozens of flights have been cancelled at Germany's biggest air hub, Frankfurt airport, after snowfall and icy conditions, according to airport operator Fraport 

Of the 1,052 flights scheduled for the day, 98 had been cancelled by early morning, a Fraport spokeswoman told German news agency dpa.

The airport said the day began under ""strained winter operations"" and warned of significant disruptions.

Passengers have been urged to check flight status before travelling to the airport and to allow extra time for their journey given the weather conditions.

The German Weather Service (DWD) issued severe weather warnings for icy conditions across parts of the state of Hesse, in which Frankfurt airport is situated.

The German Weather Service (DWD) has issued warnings of ""a widespread severe black ice situation,"" with meteorologist Oliver Reuter saying conditions would be hazardous across large areas.

The ADAC (German Automobile Club) urged drivers to avoid unnecessary trips, warning that in cases of flash ice it is better to leave cars parked. The weather service has issued severe weather warnings for black ice in several states.

Schools have been closed in multiple regions. In North Rhine-Westphalia, the country's most populous state, schools have switched to remote learning on Monday, with only emergency care offered, the state government said.

In the states of Bremen and Lower Saxony, in-person classes have also been canceled. All districts and independent cities in Lower Saxony suspended regular lessons, citing the inability to guarantee safe transport for students, with exceptions only on the East Frisian islands.

Federal Transport Minister Patrick Schnieder urged continued caution. ""The dangerous situation is not over yet,"" he told the mass-circulation Bild newspaper, while adding that overall conditions had not turned out as severe as feared.

Gunda arrived after storm Elli brought heavy snow, ice, and strong winds that disrupted travel nationwide.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz arrived in India for a two-day inaugural visit. He landed in Ahmedabad. the largest city in the state of Gujarat, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home region, shortly before 2:00 a.m. local time on Monday.

""The two leaders will take stock of the progress made in diverse aspects of the India-Germany Strategic Partnership, which completed 25 years last year,"" the Indian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on the visit.

Merz and Modi will discuss deepening cooperation in sectors including trade, investment, technology, education and defence.

The German chancellor is also due to visit the Gandhi Ashram, once the residence of Mahatma Gandhi and a main center for India's struggle for freedom from British colonial rule. 

On Tuesday, Merz is visiting Bengaluru (also known as Bangalore), the center of India's high-tech industry.

Guten Morgen from a very cold Bonn newsroom!

Much of Germany is in the grip of a cold weather system that has forced school authorities to close their doors in many parts and impacted travel for much of the weekend.

People have been advised to avoid making unnecessary journeys with the German Weather Service warning of black ice in Germany's most populous state.

And while Germany shivers, Chancellor Friedrich Merz has begun his first state visit to India.

US President Donald Trump called upon demonstrators in Iran to ""keep protesting"" against state institutions. Trump has previously threatened to intervene in response to the crackdown meted out on protesters. DW has more.

Below is a roundup of the latest news, analyses and background on the Iran protests on Tuesday January 13, 2025:

Italy's foreign minister said he summoned the Iranian ambassador over the ""absolutely unacceptable"" crackdown by Iranian authorities to quell protests across the country.

""These ​days, ​men and women across Iran are fighting in the streets and squares, paying a very high price,"" Minister Antonio Tajani ⁠told ​the lower house of ‌parliament.

Italy joins a host of European nations, including Germany, in calling in the Iranian ambassador to protest against an intense crackdown by Iranian authorities on those protesting against the clerical regime.

Russia condemned what it described as ""subversive external interference"" in Iran's internal politics and said US threats of new military strikes against the country were ""categorically unacceptable.""

""Those who plan to use externally ‍inspired unrest as ​a pretext for ​repeating the aggression against Iran committed in June 2025 must be aware of the ‍disastrous consequences of such actions for ​the situation in the Middle East ⁠and ​global international security,"" the Russian Foreign ‌Ministry ‌said in a statement.

Russia has become one of Iran's closest allies in recent years and appears to support the Iranian regime in its time of need, according to experts.

President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs against countries doing business with Iran, with Russia being among the top ten trading partners of Iran as of 2024.

The German Foreign Ministry posted to X that the heavy-handed policing of dissent by Iranian authorities over the course of protests was ""shocking,"" adding that the government has summoned Iran's ambassador in Berlin to protest against it.

""The brutal approach of the Iranian regime against its own population is shocking. We strongly urge #Iran to end the violence against its own citizens and to respect their rights. The Iranian ambassador was summoned to the AA today,"" referring to the German Foreign Ministry in German Auswaertiges Amt.

US President Donald Trump says he's canceled meetings with Iranian officials and told protesters 'help is on its way,' without giving details.

""Iranian Patriots, KEEP ‍PROTESTING - TAKE OVER ​YOUR INSTITUTIONS!!!... ​HELP IS ON ITS WAY,"" Trump said in a post ‍on his Truth Social platform.

The White House says airstrikes on Iran 'remain on the table,' as US President Donald Trump weighs up his response to a crackdown on nationwide protests. Meanwhile, rights groups say they have confirmed the killing of many hundreds of people during the demonstrations — the largest in several years.

DW News looks at what action the US might take, and how Iranians are getting around a communications blackout imposed by authorities to curb the protests.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said the European Union would seek to impose more sanctions on Iranian authorities over their crackdown on protesters.

In a post on X, von der Leyen said, ""the rising number of casualties is horrifying"" as she slammed the ""excessive use of force and continued restriction of freedom.""

The EU already sanctions the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps — the paramilitary force that is loyal to Iran's Supreme Leader and upholds the regime's fundamentalist principles — ""in its entirety"" as part of the bloc's human rights sanctions.

Von der Leyen said she and the EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas would ""swiftly"" propose more sanctions ""on those responsible for the repression.""


""We stand with the people of Iran who are bravely marching for their liberty,"" von der Leyen said.

DW has spoken with Kasra Aarabi, the director of research into Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) at US think tank United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), which has close ties to US political circles, including US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

Aarabi called for Washington to carry out military operations in support of protests in Iran.

He said that this was necessary as Iran has an ""extensive suppressive apparatus that cuts across every level and sector of Iranian society.""

""The cycle of protests and repression will continue until you change the balance of power between the unarmed civilians and the fully-armed and fully radicalized suppressive apparatus,"" he said.

He called for the US to carry out ""targeted military strikes that focus on that suppressive infrastructure,"" including ""IRGC headquarters, sub-headquarters [and] operational units.""

Asked whether Washington could directly target or capture Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, similar to its military operations in Venezuela that led to the capture of its president, Nicolas Maduro, Aarabi stressed that the situation in Iran was different.

""I think the context in Iran is very different to Venezuela — in Iran you have a highly radicalized and extensive security apparatus that is loyal to ... Ali Khamenei,"" he said.

He argued that while ""eliminating Khamenei"" would provide a ""major shock to the foundations of the Islamic Republic [of Iran],"" must also be accompanied by a ""targeted military campaign that focuses on the suppressive infrastructure.""

Aarabi called for European countries to put ""full diplomatic pressure"" on Iran and ""adopt a tough stance against ... Iranian oil,"" as well as to carry out ""cyberwarfare operations.""

Iranian prosecutors have filed the first charges against demonstrators detained during the unrest gripping the country, state media reported Tuesday.

The official Tasnim news agency said cases against so-called ""rioters"" would be handled first and treated as a priority.

""Rioters"" are also facing charges of ""waging war against God,"" a crime which carries the death penalty under Iran's Islamic laws.

On Monday, Iran's Chief Justice, Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Ejei, called for retribution against protesters who allegedly attacked police or security facilities.

His call came after the judiciary last week said demonstrators would face ""maximum severity.""

In previous waves of unrest in Iran, judicial authorities have imposed death sentences on protesters. At least 12 people were executed in the wake of the 'Women, Life, Freedom' protests in 2022.

Volker Turk, the United Nations' High Commissioner for Human Rights, has said that he is ""horrified"" by the violent crackdown by security forces against protesters in Iran.

Rights groups say over 640 protesters have been killed amid the demonstrations, which are the biggest to hit Iran since 2022.

In a statement, Turk said the ""horrific cycle of violence cannot continue. The Iranian people and ​their ​demands for fairness, equality and justice must be heard.""

UN spokesman Jeremy Laurence, who read out Turk's statement at a press conference on Tuesday morning, said UN officials have been told that ""hundreds"" of people have been killed amid the crackdown.

An Iranian official told Reuters news agency earlier on Tuesday that around 2,000 people have been killed since the unrest began over two weeks ago. Due to the media blackouts in the country, the death toll has been hard to verify.

By using violence and repression, Iran's theocratic regime has managed to cling to power and overcome several anti-government movements in recent decades.

Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who is on a state visit to India, has said the protests in Iran could spell the end of the country's Islamic regime.

Protests that began as demonstrations against the severe economic crisis in Iran have since grown into broader calls for regime change.

""If a regime can only ‌maintain ⁠power through violence, then it is effectively at its end. The population is now rising up against this regime,"" Merz said in Bengaluru.

""I assume that we are now witnessing the final days and weeks ⁠of this regime,"" the chancellor said.

On the first day of his trip to India on Monday, Merz had condemned the crackdown by Iran's security forces as ""disproportionate"" and ""brutal.""

Merz said the foreign ministers from Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom and France were closely coordinating to ""ensure that there can now be a peaceful transition in Iran to a democratically legitimate government.""

""I hope that there is a way to end this conflict peacefully,"" he said.

For more on Merz's trip to India, follow our live blog.

China's foreign ministry has said that Beijing will ""resolutely safeguard"" its rights and interests.

The remarks by the ministry's spokeswoman Mao Ning on Tuesday were in response to President Donald Trump's warning that the US would impose 25% tariffs on countries that trade with Iran.

""We have always believed that there are no winners in a tariff war, and China will resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,"" the spokeswoman said when asked about Trump's announcement.

Iran is a major source of oil for Beijing.

Trump's warning on Monday came as the US considers its response to the violent crackdown by Iran's clerical authorities on anti-government protests sweeping the country.

Washington has said it would prefer diplomatic options to resolve the situation, but has not ruled out military action.

Two Ukrainians have been accused of planning sabotage attacks for Russian spy services. Meanwhile, Germany's foreign minister has played down the US threat to Greenland. DW has more.

Welcome to DW's coverage of what Germany is talking about on Tuesday, January 13. You can catch up with yesterday's news, including Chancellor Friedrich Merz's visit to India, here.

You know what they tell children and Sesame Street fans everywhere: ""Stop for Bert, go for Ernie."" 

Ok, perhaps that's yet to catch on as a maxim, but city authorities in Hamburg are now working on it, in conjunction with regional public broadcaster NDR. 

Actors playing the Sesame Street odd couple attended the unveiling of special traffic signals for pedestrians using silhouettes in their likeness for the red and green lights on Julius-Vosseler Strasse in the northern German city.  

Thieves were able to enter a Sparkasse bank in the western city of Gelsenkirchen over the Christmas period using a ""manipulated"" emergency exit linking the branch to the car park, which it should not ordinarily have been possible to open from the outside. 

This allowed unhindered access to the bank from the car park, police said on Tuesday.

Police and the state interior minister for North Rhine-Westphalia, Herbert Reul, both issued updates on the investigation on Tuesday. 

The elaborate heist in late December grabbed headlines and raised eyebrows, not least because the thieves' presence in the bank's vault went undetected for two days.

They were able to drill a large hole directly into the vault and force their way into thousands of customers' safe deposit boxes without triggering the alarms.

You can read our full story on the state of the investigations here. 

Prosecutors in Germany on Tuesday charged two Ukrainian nationals for allegedly plotting arson and explosive attacks on behalf of Russian intelligence services.

The two men — identified only as Daniil B and ⁠Vladyslav T as per German privacy laws — are accused of sending parcels with tracking devices inside them from Cologne to Ukraine as part of plans for a sabotage operation, the indictment brought by the Stuttgart Higher Regional Court said.

According to federal prosecutors, the men allegedly planned to post packages containing explosive devices that ""ignite in Germany or elsewhere on their way to parts of Ukraine not occupied by Russia"" to cause ""as much damage as possible in order to undermine the population's sense of security.""

The men were arrested in May along with a third Ukrainian, Yevhen B, who is believed to be an accomplice and who was arrested in Switzerland. 

The third man was recently extradited to Germany and is expected to be charged soon, the Federal Prosecutor's Office said.

The men's arrest came after multiple incidents involving detonating parcels at European mail depots in 2024. 

European officials have pointed to those cases and other examples of sabotage as evidence of a growing threat of hybrid attacks from Russia in the wake of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Russia has denied any involvement.

German car manufacturing giant Volkswagen (VW) reported a drop in sales of 1.4% for 2025, with low demand in China and the US being the main reasons, the company said on Tuesday.

Sales in China fell 8.4% — with a total of 2.02 million vehicles sold — amid what VW called ""challenging market conditions"" as it faces competition from domestic electric car production.

Sales were similarly down in the US, by 8.2% — 544,000 vehicles sold — thanks to US tariffs leaving a ""marked impact.""

At the same time, sales were up in Europe (5.1%) and South America (18.5%). The total number of vehicles sold from the VW core brand was 4.37 million.

Other brands belonging to the Volkswagen Group, including Audi, Skoda and Bentley, among others, also saw a slight fall in sales, down around 0.5% in 2025.

Police in the eastern German town of Sömmerda were left baffled after being called to the scene of a robbery, only to find that a grand total of one jar of sausages had been pilfered after thieves broke into an apartment.

Hailed by the German press agency DPA as the ""Wurst heist ever,"" police said on Tuesday the value of the missing jar of Knackwurst was around €3 ($3.50).

The incident took place last Thursday, not far from the city of Leipzig, with the 29-year-old victim left wondering why the thieves had even bothered to break in.

Police said the damage caused to the door will likely ""far exceed"" the value of the sausage swag.

An investigation is already underway.

Sondervermögen, which means ""special fund,"" has been picked as the worst German word of the year by a jury at Marburg's Philipps University.

The panel said the word was ""misleading"" after being bandied about in the Bundestag.

The word had its time in the limelight thanks to a deal between the now co-ruling conservatives and Social Democrats to set up a €500-billion ($583-billion) special fund to invest in infrastructure and climate protections over the next decade.

The jury argued that the euphemistic way the word has been used hides the fact that it means taking on debt.

Four linguists, a journalist and one rotating member are responsible for picking the worst word.

The criteria for this ""non-word"" are terms and expressions that violate the princples of human dignity or democracy, discriminate against social groups, or are considered to be misleading or euphemistic

A majority of 62% of respondents said that Germany should offer military support to NATO ally Denmark, if the US were to attack Greenland, according to a survey published in Stern magazine on Tuesday.

Around a third of respondents were against military support for Denmark.

The most support was seen among voters of the Greens, the CDU/CSU, the Left Party and the Social Democrats (SPD).

Among supporters of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), a majority (59%) were against military support in the case of a US attack.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul met with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres in New York on Monday evening.

Wadephul said Germany wants to secure more senior positions within the United Nations, saying the representation it currently has does not reflect Germany's influence and level of financial and international engagement.

The foreign minister was careful not to make his comments sound like an ultimatum, saying that German engagement in the UN would continue even when decisions are made that don't align with German interests.

""But it must be clear for the future that Germany wants to have a place at the UN table,"" he said.

Wadephul also suggested Germany could host more UN agencies. Several are already located in the former West German capital, Bonn.

Guterres was receptive to Germany's concerns, Wadephul said, and was confident its position would also be well received by the wider organization.

Before his meeting with Guterres, Wadephul met with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Despite having warm words for his US counterpart, Wadephul was critical of the US position on the UN.

""The United States has been crucial in shaping and building the international order for decades,"" Wadephul said. ""That they are now withdrawing from several organizations is regrettable.""

The German chancellor considers the current Iranian leadership to be facing its end amid the mass protests that have shaken Iran since late December and which have been met with deadly repression from the state.

""If a regime can only stay in power through the use of violence, then it is effectively finished,"" Merz said on Tuesday during a visit to Bengaluru in India.

""I assume that we may now be witnessing the final days and weeks of this regime.""

Merz has made no secret of his hope for an end to the regime in Iran, saying last June during its bombing campaign on Iran that Israel was doing the ""dirty work for us.""

Friedrich Merz is due in Bengaluru, often called India's Silicon Valley, after meeting PM Modi in Ahmedabad.

The visit comes just weeks ahead of plans to sign a long-awaited free trade agreement between India and the EU.

Heavy snows last week brought German trains to a halt in large parts of the country's north.

Lawmakers from across the spectrum have called for Germany's rail network operator Deutsche Bahn (DB) to be held to account.

For its part, DB said it was well prepared for such extreme weather, with more than three-quarters of rail switches being heated to prevent freezing up, German public broadcaster Tagesschau reported.

The problem, the company said, is that northern Germany is so flat that it is hit worse by cold weather and even heated switches cannot function when covered in snow.

Hundreds of DB employees were sent out to manually clear tracks of snow, but the rail passenger association Pro Bahn told the Spiegel magazine there were not enough employees for this job, and fewer than there used to be.

Dirk Flege, the head of the interest group Allianz pro Schiene, said the main reason for the widespread cancellation of trains was the focus on punctuality figures, since cancelled trains aren't included in the statistics and therefore don't bring down the overall punctuality score, something DB has struggled with for years.

Flege also criticized, as quoted by Tagesschau, that DB is expected to make a profit. Under the pressure to cut costs, the vehicle fleet is not expanded enough to meet the needs of extreme weather.

He also pointed to countries like Austria and Switzerland, where the kind of travel chaos seen last week rarely happens. But DB says this argument doesn't hold up since the impacted rail network in northern Germany alone is almost as big as Austria's entire rail network.

Strict protocol normally governs trips like this. Schedules are choreographed to the minute, printed in advance, and rarely adjusted—except in moments of acute geopolitical turbulence, as during the recent Middle East escalation. The structure provides predictability for everyone involved: diplomats, advisers, drivers, logisticians, journalists, and their newsrooms at home.

But keeping the US engaged—and ensuring Germany stays engaged with the US—demands a different approach. For a German foreign minister, representing the world's third-largest economy, and his team, flexibility becomes the currency of access. And in Washington, one thing is unmistakable: the Germans want something from the Americans. Some would say more than the Americans want from them. So they take whatever slot, however small, is offered.

On Sunday, word comes that Secretary of State Marco Rubio won't make the planned Monday morning meeting. Schedules are tossed, security checks reshuffled, driver logistics reworked for the afternoon. At least that frees up time for the World Bank president. Rubio ends up talking slightly longer with Wadephul than planned? No complaint—they grab every minute, skip their train to New York, and rebook everything for a later departure. A potential opportunity for further political talks on Tuesday? The entire trip is extended.

Until the final hours, the German foreign minister keeps his schedule open, determined to stay responsive to Washington's shifting priorities and messaging. Wadephul wants to wring every drop of political value out of his US visit.

Substantively, his message remains steady: both sides need each other. Disagreements—whether over Venezuela, Greenland, or Russia—are normal among partners. What you won't hear from him is the German finance minister's phrase “alliance in dissolution.”

The dynamic is clear: the Germans are seeking something from the Americans, perhaps more than vice versa. After meeting Rubio, Wadephul appears alone before the press and spends 15 minutes describing the shared interests binding the transatlantic partners. Two hours later, the State Department releases a 14-line readout.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul on Monday played down suggestions that the United States could invade Greenlandwith its military.

Speaking after a meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Wadephul said there was ""no reason"" to believe that such action was being ""seriously considered"" and insisted that NATO members shared a common interest in ensuring security in the Arctic.

""The United States stands at Europe's side and is fully committed to defending law and freedom in the western world,"" Wadephul said. ""Of that there is absolutely no doubt. I would advise us Europeans not to start doubting things which aren't being doubted in Washington.""

Looking ahead to talks between Rubio and the Danish foreign minister later this week, Wadephul said he had ""no doubt that these will take place in a friendly and cooperative manner,"" and rejected suggestions that the United States under President Donald Trump has turned its back on the common values underpinning NATO.

A jury of linguistic experts in the western German town of Marburg are set to announce their ""word of the year"" – in a negative sense.

There are several ""word of the year"" (Wort des Jahres) competitions in Germany, with the 2025 prize going to KI-Ära (AI era) in recognition of the emergence of artificial intelligence into the public mainstream, and ""Das crazy"" winning Youth Word of the Year.

But the negative non-word of the year (or Unwort des Jahres) aims to raise awareness of less pleasant phrases or terms which may be discriminatory or inappropriate but which have nevertheless established themselves among German speakers.

The first ever ""Un-Word"" of the year was crowned in 1991, with the dubious prize going to ausländerfrei (foreigner-free), while last year's ""winner"" followed an unfortunately similar theme: biodeutsch (""biologically German"" as opposed to naturalized German citizens).

Other controversial terms which have been highlighted in recent years include: Remigration, Klimaterroristen (climate terrorists), Klimahysterie (climate hysteria) and alternative Fakten (alternative facts).

Guten Morgen! Welcome to DW's coverage of what Germany is talking about on Tuesday, January 13.

While German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has been in India, Vice Chancellor and Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil and Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul are in Washington. Wadephul met US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Monday as well as United Nations chief Antonio Guterres.

Back in Germany, Defense Minister Boris Pistorius is due to meet the European Union's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas in Berlin on Tuesday afternoon.

Elsewhere, a suspected member of the Lebanese Islamist group Hezbollah is set to go on trial in Berlin while, in Düsseldorf, six suspected members of a left-wing extremist organization are accused of attempted murder.","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW.com'}","world"

Government officials face being banned from the United States if they block X over its AI service Grok creating naked images of women and children.

On Monday night, US officials warned that they had the “right to up the ante” and introduce travel bans if Sir Keir Starmer makes good on his threat to block Elon Musk's social media platform, The Telegraph can reveal.

Liz Kendall, the Technology Secretary, said the Government would this week bring into force a new offence criminalising the creation of sexualised non-consensual AI images in a clampdown on the platform.

Ms Kendall said she would also make creating the images a priority offence under the Online Safety Act, meaning sites such as X would have to prove they are taking steps to prevent the images.

Ofcom, the technology and media regulator, will also be given new powers to pursue companies that allow the hosting and sharing of the images on their sites, Ms Kendall said.

Ofcom first made contact with X a week ago, giving it a deadline of Friday to provide evidence about how it was dealing with online safety laws. It said it had launched the investigation after an “expedited assessment” of this evidence.

It said it had the power to block X from the UK if the company did not comply with its investigation.

Following the news, a state department source told The Telegraph that “UK officials could face being barred from the US over plans to ban X”.

Sarah Rogers, Trump's free speech tsar, has also warned that “nothing's off the table” if Sir Keir enacts the ban. 

The unprecedented proposal to ban sitting British government officials from entering the US would mark an extraordinary escalation in transatlantic tensions over freedom of speech.

Officials have already drawn up plans to subpoena Ofcom staff should they set foot in the US, where they will be questioned on their involvement in censoring the tech company, The Telegraph understands.

“Figures in Washington are planning to question officials that travel to the United States, either at the border or in the country itself, possibly even subpoenaed,” a source with knowledge of the discussions said.

On GB News on Tuesday morning, Ms Rogers, the undersecretary for public diplomacy at the state department, suggested that Labour's threat to prohibit Elon Musk's social media was censorship similar to Russia, Venezuela and Iran. 

She added: “What the British Government wants is the ability to curate a public square to suppress political viewpoints it dislikes.

 “And that is why it's targeted X for a potential ban even though other AI widgets afford similar capabilities. X has a political valence that the British Government is antagonistic to and doesn't like and that's what's really going on here.”

Banning X would cause uproar in Washington. The Trump administration has become increasingly hawkish towards attempts to censor American companies and its citizens.

When he was one of the president's close advisers, Mr Musk is understood to have pushed Mr Trump to raise curbs on social media regulation in trade talks with the UK.

Since then, Ms Rogers has led the president's attack against foreign censorship. Writing on X, Ms Rogers compared the UK Government's tactics to those used by Vladimir Putin, describing the plans as a “Russia-style” ban.

She also suggested that the US government has the means to circumvent any ban that comes into place.

“The American government has a full range of tools that we can use to facilitate uncensored internet access for people in closed societies where the Government tries to ban it,” she told Newsmax.

Curbing the social media platform would be the final straw for her and other top officials who have already handed out visa bans to Britons, seen to encourage censorship.

They include Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), a group set up by Sir Keir's chief of staff, and Clare Melford, who heads the Global Disinformation Index (GDI).

Mr Ahmed is fighting deportation, while Mrs Melford had her US visa revoked.

Insiders told The Telegraph that the initial round of visa bans was designed to send a strong message to Sir Keir.

Banning X, however, would almost certainly elicit a stronger response, sources said.

“They were determined not to sanction any government officials, but they considered X the prize jewel to protect. If X were banned, all hell would break loose,” a source with knowledge of the situation said.

Thierry Bretton, the former European commissioner, was also banned from American soil in December after the bloc fined X $140m (£104m) for breaching online content rules.

A State Department source said UK government officials could expect to face similar retaliation.

Another person familiar with the ongoing planning said banning X could spell disaster for the special relationship between Washington and London, which has frayed in recent months.

“The Westminster establishment and the US have had a shift in values that has been ongoing for years. Obviously, the special relationship would cease if the UK banned US tech giants,” one insider added.

Last month, the US pulled the tech prosperity agreement over complaints that Britain's Online Safety Act would police American AI companies.

Washington is using this complaint in order to secure fresh terms in its trade deal with London, including having the UK accept chlorinated chicken and hormone-laced beef.

Republicans have already begun drafting legislation ahead of any ban.

Representative Anna Paulina Luna, an ally of Mr Trump, warned she would bring forward a law to “sanction not only Starmer, but Britain as a whole” if it moved to block the social media platform.

Downing Street has held talks with like-minded governments, including Canada and Australia, about a coordinated response to the controversy.

Indonesia became the first country to block access to Grok on Saturday, citing a “serious violation of human rights, dignity, and the security of citizens in the digital space”.

Figures within the Trump administration rallied behind Mr Musk after X was sanctioned by the EU last month, with Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, branding the decision “an attack on all American tech platforms and the American people”.

Following an explosive fallout with the president in June, the tech billionaire appears to have recently been brought back into the fold.

On Monday, he met with Pete Hegseth, the defence secretary, at the headquarters of SpaceX in Texas as part of a tour to boost the US defence industrial base.

The visit comes just days after the US Space Force awarded SpaceX $700m for missile warning service and the Federal Communications Commission granted the company approval to launch an additional 7,500 Starlink satellites.

A state department spokesman said: “As a general matter, we do not preview any potential visa or sanctions actions. The United States will continue to take all necessary actions to protect the free speech rights of our citizens from foreign threats.”

Trump has pledged to spend tariff revenues on various projects, including funding child care and helping farmers.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

President Donald Trump has promised numerous times that he would use some of the funds raised from his controversial tariffs to distribute a $2,000 “dividend” to American households — but in a recent interview with The New York Times, he appeared to have forgotten that pledge altogether.

In an interview published this week, Trump appeared confused when a reporter asked when Americans could expect their checks.

“You've promised $2,000 checks to Americans based off of your tariff revenues. When can they expect those?” Times journalist Katie Rogers asked the president. 

“I did do that?” Trump asked.

Donald Trump seems to forget that he promised Americans $2,000 rebate checks from his tariffs while speaking with reporters. He later goes on to say, the checks may not arrive until the end of 2026. pic.twitter.com/bVmYiaAmlh

Trump then assured the reporters that he would make the payments happen, though he left out the specifics on when they would occur.

“I am going to,” Trump said. “The tariff money is so substantial that's coming in, that I'll be able to do $2,000 sometime, I would say toward the end of the year.”

Trump also bragged about payments he claimed were already paid for using tariff revenues, citing the $1,776 checks that were distributed to members of the U.S. military. However, that money did not, in fact, stem from tariff revenues, but was instead allocated by Congress through legislation last summer. 

Should Trump make good on his vow to send out $2,000 checks by “the end of this year,” the checks would still be coming later than he had promised in the past.

In November, Trump made a post on Truth Social calling people who are opposed to his tariffs “FOOLS,” and made the promise of “a dividend of at least $2,000 a person.” In December, Trump said, “We're going to be giving a nice dividend to the people.”

Despite saying those payments would happen at the end of 2026 in the Times interview, Trump had said in those previous statements they would occur “sometime” or in the “middle” of the year, indicating that he is pushing back the timeline — if they get sent out at all. 

Trump has made many other promises regarding what the tariff revenues will be used for, including claiming they may one day end the need for income taxes, an assertion experts say is highly unlikely. He has also stated that tariffs would be used to reduce the national debt, fund child care, support struggling farmers, and more.

There's ample reason to believe the “tariff dividends” Trump has promised will never materialize, as he has broken similar promises before.

The Trump administration has previously said it was considering paying out $5,000 “dividends” to Americans, supposedly derived from cuts by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). That plan has since fizzled out, and hasn't been discussed by Trump for several months now. 

It's also likely that the U.S. Supreme Court will rule that Trump's widespread tariffs, based on his legally questionable declarations of national emergencies, are unlawful. Trump has dubiously stated that such a ruling could put the nation's security at risk. 

Even if tariff dividend checks could be sent out, the $2,000 wouldn't be enough to cover the costs the tariffs brought to many American families, as some estimates show that tariffs have cost households as much as $2,600 in additional costs per year.

…We ask that you take just a second to read this message.

We are up against a far-reaching, wide-scale attack on press freedom coming from the Trump administration. Since his inauguration last year, we've seen frightening censorship, a right-wing takeover of the news industry, and worsening financial conditions for progressive nonprofits across the board.

We can only resist Trump's agenda by cultivating a strong base of support. The right-wing mediasphere is funded comfortably by billionaire owners and venture capitalist philanthropists. At Truthout, we have you.

I have a confession to make: I wake up with morning stiffness these days. It's not yet a major concern, and I wake up early enough to do some stretches to safely get my day going. I'm in good company. Millions of people wake up with stiffness—you don't even have to be old to experience stiff joints and muscles in the morning. Add in medical considerations such as arthritis, and morning stiffness can be profound.

Stiffness doesn't always get all the credit it deserves for being a troublemaker, but it is unfortunately excellent at limiting our safety and independence in functional tasks and self-care activities, and can also put us at risk of muscular sprains and strains or outright falls that can cause severe injuries.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

 But a U.S. Strike Would Prop It Up 

 Jamsheed K. Choksy and Carol E. B. Choksy

Many thousands of Iranians are again risking their lives to protest their authoritarian, theocratic regime. And as it has done during previous protests, the regime is responding by cutting off the country's Internet access, unleashing violence on its citizens, and blaming foreign scapegoats. The protests' death toll is rising: Iran Human Rights, a Norway-based nongovernmental organization, estimates that over 600 demonstrators have been killed nationwide since late December.

Perhaps emboldened by his recent ouster of Nicolás Maduro, the Venezuelan leader, U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly vowed to launch military strikes if Tehran continues to repress protest. The United States “will start shooting too,” he warned on January 6, if Iranian protesters keep getting killed. Tehran's heavily armed troops and militias have brutally suppressed previous demonstrations, and there is a genuine need to prevent a larger massacre. Moreover, the Islamic Republic appears more fragile than ever after last June's 12-day war. The regime seems incapable of addressing the root causes of the economic crisis that has driven its people to the streets; protests have spread from Tehran to every corner of the country, revealing Iranians' widespread lack of faith that their current leaders can set the country on a better course.

All these factors surely increase the Trump administration's temptation to deal Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's regime a deathblow—or even a warning shot to try to convince it to negotiate a change in governance. But an attack by Trump would damage the protest movement far more than the regime and could undermine an effort that has plenty of momentum for change on its own.

These protests represent broader concerns than did Iran's other, recent popular uprisings. After Iran's 2009 presidential election, widespread demonstrations broke out over vote rigging; in 2019, an overnight spike in gas prices prompted large protests; and 2022's “Women, Life, Freedom” protests focused on the theocratic regime's draconian punishment for behavior and dress-code violations. But although the crash of the Iranian rial—which, in late December, declined in value by 50 percent—was the immediate trigger for the ongoing protests that began on December 28, that devaluation merely represents the broader economy's catastrophic condition: for most Iranians, the country has become unlivable. According to the UN Food and Agricultural Organization, food prices overall have jumped by 72 percent since January 2025. An Iranian government spokesman warned that they could rise by another 20 to 30 percent in the coming weeks.

For many years, Tehran regulated and subsidized the prices of essential commodities such as rice and cooking oil, but after the currency devaluation cut into the regime's economic reserves it has instructed that free-market prices should prevail. But few Iranians can afford to pay these prices, thanks to longer-term disastrous shifts in the Iranian economy. Between January and December of 2025, inflation soared by over 48 percent and housing costs climbed by almost 37 percent. According to the government-run Statistical Center of Iran, the average Iranian would now have to save for 100 years to be able to purchase a modest apartment in a major city.

Meanwhile, crumbling infrastructure and outdated equipment have stalled Iran's industrial expansion. The country's economy relies on oil and gas for 80 percent of its exports and 30 percent of national revenue, a dependence that will not go away even if U.S. sanctions are lifted. Domestic manufacturing has largely ground to a standstill as customers are unable to pay for orders. Work stoppages and strikes are increasingly frequent. Together, these factors drove GDP growth down from 5.3 percent in 2023 to 0.6 percent in 2025. A shadow economy has flourished as the formal economy has stalled, but the benefits of commodity smuggling and human trafficking disproportionately flow to elites because of judicial corruption.



Educated youth and professionals have been hit especially hard. The country's overall unemployment is officially 9.2 percent, with youth unemployment around 23 percent. But these numbers likely underestimate the scale of the problem. Iran's population is well educated—over 61 percent of both men and women have completed a university degree, according to the World Bank—but few can gain any economic rewards or professional stability from their knowledge.

Citizens are also frustrated by the theocratic regime's reckless exploitation of Iran's natural resources, which has accelerated environmental degradation. Major rivers supplying Isfahan and Shiraz with water now routinely run dry, and Tehran is running out of water. In November 2025, the government proposed a likely unworkable plan to relocate the nation's capital to the southeastern coast of the Persian Gulf. Pollution, meanwhile, is turning the urban air toxic and extreme heat is rendering parts of the country uninhabitable, especially around the southern and southwestern oil and gas fields. Population migration northward is depleting the oil industry's workforce, and rising temperatures are limiting farmers' ability to raise livestock and harvest. The Iranian government has been incapable of managing climate change, in part because of corruption among officials tasked with implementing remediation projects.

One factor not actively influencing the protests is the collapse of Iran's so-called axis of resistance and the country's various military humiliations by Israel and the United States since October 7. Although citizens are, by and large, relieved that the regime is incurring less expense supporting foreign proxies in Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria, ordinary people have yet to see any real benefits.

Like other successful domestic revolts in Iran—the 1905–6 constitutional revolution and the 1978–79 Islamic Revolution—the recent demonstrations unite men and women from a range of socioeconomic classes and professions: merchants, public and private employees, students, seminarians, public intellectuals, and moderate Shiite clerics. Although merchants facing business collapse initially organized the demonstrations, university students and unemployed young adults picked up on this momentum in cities across the country. The government inadvertently helped spread the protests to smaller villages by criticizing protesters in state media; the reporting prompted otherwise isolated citizens to express their discontent. Now the uprising has become self-sustaining.

Iran's government has sought to placate the public by announcing an increase of more than 300 percent to the monthly credit subsidy that much of the population receives. But the truth is that Iran's central bank does not have the money to deliver this promise. If it tries to pay off citizens, it is likely to trigger a further depreciation of the rial. Iran's domestic problems simply cannot be solved without integrating Iran's economy into the region and the world. This is why Tehran has made some rapprochements with Riyadh and suggested a willingness to negotiate with Washington and European governments.

But Khamenei is now in a Catch-22: he understands that opening Iran's markets and society enough to fix its economic problems will also speed the end of his rule. So he and some other hard-line leaders have resorted to blaming alleged external instigators. State-controlled media outlets claim that the protests are “manufactured chaos” originating from spy agencies in Israel, Washington, and even the United Kingdom.

Iranian leaders are more split on how to respond than they have been in the past. Iranians know that Khamenei cannot halt, let alone reverse, these rapidly mounting national crises. In December, Iran's parliament rejected the executive branch's proposed 2026 budget, declaring to President Masoud Pezeshkian that it was inadequate to address the country's problems. The regime has raced to appoint a new central bank governor, hopelessly tasked with lowering the inflation rate, stabilizing the currency, and curtailing the shadow economy all at once. Pezeshkian and other senior officials have thrown up their hands and instructed regional authorities to solve crises locally.

Pezeshkian himself has made a series of extraordinary admissions of failure, acknowledging to government officials in December that “the government is stuck, really badly stuck. … Catastrophes are raining down. … The problem is us.” He told a group of university students, “If someone can do something, by all means go for it. I can't do anything; don't curse me.” The antigovernment demonstrations have forced Tehran to ask opposition leaders for dialogue. On December 30, in another unprecedented move, an official administration spokesperson acknowledged that “we see, hear, and recognize the reasons for protests.” These are signs that the regime knows it is on the ropes.

The success of the protests in generating real change is not guaranteed. One major problem handicapping the demonstrations is that the protesters also have not rallied behind a single public face. During the Islamic Revolution, by contrast, the charismatic Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini led the uprising against Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, creating a unifying national figure for the cause.

The various Iranian dissident groups supporting the protests—and which could lead a post-Khamenei regime—also lack a shared ideology and method. Former Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, the son of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, retains symbolic support in a country with a long imperial history. The United States and Israel could turn to him to try to stabilize a post-theocratic Iran; Pahlavi even has an administrative plan sketched out to restore the monarchy. But having spent almost 50 years in exile, Pahlavi and his advisers have very limited organizational capacity within Iran. And Iranians may not want to risk a return to an older form of absolutist rule—especially not a monarchy beholden to the United States, which supported the shah.

The National Council of Resistance of Iran, meanwhile—an opposition coalition periodically favored in Washington—is linked to the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran, or MEK. The MEK has some organizational capacity within Iran, but it is widely disliked by many Iranians for its support of Iraq during the Iran-Iraq War and for its Marxist orientation. The leaders of the so-called Green Movement, which came close to overthrowing Khamenei's government during a wave of 2009–10 protests, are now elderly and remain in government detention. If they were freed, they could play a role in transitioning Iran to more secular and representative government. So could former Iranian presidents Mohammad Khatami and Hassan Rouhani, who both attempted reforms during their terms in 1997 to 2005 and 2013 to 2021, respectively.

There is one thing, however, that might unify the country temporarily, but in the wrong way: a foreign attack. Iran's leaders know that U.S. or Israeli strikes would shift ordinary citizens' focus away from protesting. Antigovernment protests were gaining momentum last June, when the 12-day war broke out. But as Israeli and U.S. bombs fell, ordinary citizens had to go into hiding, giving Tehran a six-month reprieve from popular discontent. Trump's threats do not seem to be making the regime more reluctant to brutalize protesters, and in recent days, commanders of Iran's Revolutionary Guards have spoken about launching preemptive strikes to tempt the United States and Israel into retaliating. In a Sunday interview on state television, even the usually relatively temperate Pezeshkian's rhetoric became more hard-line: he blasted the protesters as “rioters” and “terrorist elements,” echoing Khamenei.

Exactly when and how Iran's current regime will fall is unclear. Khamenei, who is 86, could cling to power until he is incapacitated or dies. Midlevel Revolutionary Guards leaders, seeking to preserve their organization's economic clout, may step in and impose military rule. Protesters could overwhelm local and national security forces, forcing pro-regime religious leaders and politicians to flee. But irrespective of their feelings about their regime, Iranians in the country have no desire for U.S.-led regime change. They have seen it fail along their own borders in Iraq and Afghanistan. And in the first few days of 2026, they have witnessed the United States' incursion into Venezuela with no plan for political succession or stabilization. They do not want the Trump administration to plunder their oil industry, either.

Iran does not need a government built from scratch. It already has executive and legislative branches of government, a popularly elected president, and representatives who appoint justices to the judicial branch—even if the independence of those three branches of state is undermined by their subordination to Iran's theocratic wing. Most important, Iran has previous experience with citizen-driven political change, during the constitutional revolution of 1905–6. That democratic breakthrough resulted in political reforms including a popularly elected parliament, multiple political parties, a free press, and civic involvement from all societal groups. Iranians can replicate those events in the twenty-first century.

The plain fact is that the Khamenei regime's days are numbered, at least in its present form. Even with brutality, the ayatollah and his cohort are struggling to drive protesters off the streets. Missiles are not needed. Iran's citizens can topple the theocrats on their own.

 The Consequences of Trump's Assault on International Law

 Oona A. Hathaway and Scott J. Shapiro

From the beginning of his presidency, Donald Trump has threatened to destabilize the international legal order. Early in his second term, he claimed he would “take back” the Panama Canal, make Canada the 51st U.S. state, acquire Greenland, and “own” Gaza. Foreign policy experts shook their heads, reluctant to take Trump seriously. After all, his declarations seemed erratic and poorly thought out. Yet even speaking the words did damage. As we argued in Foreign Affairs last summer, Trump's threats reflected a troubling lack of commitment to the legal structure the United States and its allies created 80 years ago. The norm against the use of force, embodied in the UN Charter, was already under strain. But Trump's open disregard of this prohibition threatened to trigger its collapse.

That was before the United States invaded Venezuela and kidnapped its president, Nicolás Maduro, on January 3. The military operation, undertaken without UN Security Council authorization, without congressional authorization, without a claim of self-defense, and without even a plausible legal rationale, represents the most harmful attack yet on the rules-based order. It is not just the existing international legal system that is in jeopardy now. At risk is the survival of any rules at all—and with them any constraints on the exercise of state power.

Before countries renounced the right to war, first in the 1928 Kellogg-Briand Pact and then again in the UN Charter in 1945, waging war was perfectly legal and legitimate. It was the main way in which countries resolved their disputes with one another. But even during this time, war was constrained by law. War, in its lawful conception, was understood as a last resort undertaken to enforce or defend a state's rights. Killing, seizure of property, and destruction were permitted only if the entire endeavor was justified by law.

At the beginning of the twentieth century and for centuries before that, a country could not simply say it wanted another's land. According to customary international law, as interpreted and popularized by the so-called father of international law, Hugo Grotius, in the early seventeenth century, a state had to offer a legal justification before it could go to war. Violence was acceptable, but only if it was necessary to vindicate a legal right. Sovereigns had to argue that another country had failed to pay a debt, unacceptably interfered with trade relations, violated a treaty obligation, or committed some other wrong that was considered an acceptable cause for war. This practice received formal legal sanction by the states that signed the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, when they recognized that those who would go to war must make “a lawful Cognizance of the Cause.” Sovereigns took this obligation seriously, always issuing war manifestos to explain their reasons for entering a conflict as fighting began. They did this with the understanding that without such a claim, violence is not war. It is crime: murder, assault, kidnapping, and theft.

For the past eight decades, legitimate grounds for war have been much more narrowly defined. The current international system rests on the premise that the use of force by one state against another is prohibited, even criminal, unless undertaken in self-defense or with collective authorization by the UN Security Council. War is not considered a discretionary policy instrument, and the unlawful use of force does not give the perpetrator legal rights. Whereas conquering territory used to be enough to gain title to it, if a state today acquires another's territory through an illegal use of force, the rest of the world is under a duty not to recognize its claims of sovereignty over the territory. Countries have violated these rules, sometimes gravely. But even rule-breaking states have offered legal rationales, recognizing that other states—and their own citizens—believe that killing people and taking their land and property requires justification, not merely power.

The Trump administration is no longer trying to work within this system. For the past year, it has been attacking and dismantling the legal infrastructure of the existing order. It is sanctioning judges and lawyers who work at the International Criminal Court so that crimes cannot be prosecuted. It is throwing up trade barriers, breaching World Trade Organization agreements and retreating from the norm of free trade that once underwrote global stability. It is failing to pay its dues to the United Nations and withdrawing from or violating countless treaties. And it is openly threatening sovereign states and territories—Venezuela today, Colombia, Cuba, Greenland, and Mexico tomorrow—not with lawful UN Security Council–authorized measures but with unlawful unilateral force and coercion. Because so many countries depend on the United States for their defense, their economic stability, or both, all but a few have been mere bystanders to the destruction.

It would be bad enough to return to the prewar international system, in which states engaged in looting and conquest openly and unapologetically. It was a time when leaders launched wars based on the violation of a vast array of legal rights—and the people suffered the consequences of the widespread violence that followed.

But what may be in store could be even worse. In the short term, the world faces deep instability; leaders may sometimes invoke the postwar rules but may also increasingly ignore them, depending on what is convenient. This is a recipe for unrelenting conflict, as states would be in doubt about what the rules are and therefore unsure of how to avoid provoking violence. Until a clear set of rules takes hold, the world will be a profoundly dangerous place.

A longer-term possibility is a world in which states are no longer prohibited from resorting to force and at least one superpower acts as if there are no rules at all. In this world, not only would the rules be unpredictable, they would depend entirely on the impulses of whoever happens to command the most coercive power at a given moment.



What is worrying is that the Trump administration seems to be ushering in such a world. The day after the United States kidnapped Maduro and his wife in Venezuela, the senior Trump aide Stephen Miller explained the administration's thinking in an interview with the CNN host Jake Tapper. “We live in a world, in the real world, Jake, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power,” Miller said. “These are the iron laws of the world since the beginning of time.” Neither Miller nor anyone else in the administration offered any real legal justification for launching a military assault on Venezuela—an operation that killed at least 75 people. There has been no legal justification, either, for the plan Trump announced on social media to seize “between 30 and 50 MILLION Barrels” of Venezuelan oil. Instead, the State Department shared an image of the U.S. president emblazoned with the words “This is OUR Hemisphere,” and Trump styled himself in a Truth Social post as the “Acting President of Venezuela.” Now, the administration has begun to turn its sights on Greenland. A White House statement issued days after the capture of Maduro claims that the United States “needs” Greenland and that acquiring the territory is a “national security priority.”

What is so troubling about the Trump administration's words and actions is not just that the administration is breaking the law. And it is: the intervention in Venezuela clearly violates the UN Charter's prohibition on the use of force. But more than that, U.S. officials have discarded the idea of legal constraints altogether. The only constraint, Trump said in an interview with The New York Times last week, is his “own morality.” There is no real argument to defend the government's behavior. No pretense. No attempt to persuade. When a policy is announced in an online post, without explanation or justification, one has the unsettling sense that its makers see no need to bother cloaking it with a lie. A system of rules can survive some hypocrisy, but nihilism will bring it down.

At the same time, the Trump administration is acting as though the threat or use of force alone can grant it legal entitlements. Gunboat diplomacy, roundly renounced when war was outlawed, has returned. The United States is using oil blockades, coercive seizures, and military threats to extract political and economic concessions from other countries. This is an attempt to assert that power alone creates rights, regardless of reason.

A world in which the powerful no longer feel the need to justify themselves is not merely unjust. It is barbaric: operations to kill, steal, and destroy are severed from any claim of right. That world does not have a legal order at all. It has only force, guided by one man's whims.

 Russia's Growing Resolve to Fight On in Ukraine

 Andrei Kolesnikov

During the Cold War, few senior Soviet officials understood the dynamics of Soviet relations with the West as well as Valentin Falin. A diplomat and adviser to several Soviet leaders, Falin was instrumental in improving relations between the Soviets and West Germany in the early 1970s. It was part of the détente that culminated in the Helsinki Accords, the breakthrough agreement that finally, 30 years after the end of World War II, stabilized relations between the Western alliance and the Soviet bloc. Looking back on his experiences, Falin wrote that “confrontation is not fate, but choice.” As he saw it, in the global face-off between superpowers, confrontation happened because one or both sides chose to fight; détente happened because they chose not to fight. In every case, he felt, what happened resulted from an absolutely conscious decision on the part of the respective leaders.

Falin's insight may be particularly useful for grasping Russian President Vladimir Putin's approach to the war in Ukraine—and why U.S. President Donald Trump's yearlong effort to end it has continually fallen short. According to Trump, Russia should be happy to agree to a peace deal; it is just a matter of coming up with the right terms. Indeed, the Trump administration has proceeded from the same false (but understandable) assumption as its predecessor that Putin acts rationally. In the winter of 2021–22, U.S. President Joe Biden thought he could persuade the Russian leader not to launch the “special operation” because its motives made no sense and achieving its goals would be too costly in human and economic resources. By the same logic, Trump has assumed that the “special operation” could be ended by lavishing Putin with territorial concessions and new business deals with the United States, which should be particularly attractive against the backdrop of Russia's eroding economy.

The Trump administration thus spent 2025 offering a series of apparently inviting options for Moscow, including ceding unconquered lands to Russia, prohibiting Ukraine's entry to NATO, and placing restrictions on Ukrainian forces. The president also courted Putin with a grand summit meeting in Alaska and numerous phone calls, all the while assuring the world that a deal was about to be reached—on his first day in office, or by Thanksgiving, or by Christmas. Trump even agreed with the Kremlin's implausible insistence that substantive negotiations, and even new presidential elections in Ukraine, can take place while fighting rages on.

But none of these offers has brought the end of the war any closer. Putin, who has begun appearing in public in military uniform surrounded by generals, no longer hides his desire to “return” the Donbas to Russia by military rather than diplomatic means. The past year has made it clear that he has decided to continue fighting, regardless of the economic and human cost. And he has determined that he can do so while keeping Trump's United States as a geopolitical partner. This might be called the new “Putin doctrine.” Now that the United States has embarked on its own special operation, to capture Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela, the second part of this doctrine may not be so successful: Moscow clearly wants to keep Caracas in its sphere of influence, but under the new circumstances, it can't. All Moscow could respond with was a barrage of statements from the Foreign Ministry in defense of Maduro's Venezuela and ironic remarks by Putin's ally, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev: now the United States has nothing to reproach Russia for—the Venezuelan operation is just as much an exercise of “might makes right” as the Ukrainian one.

But Trump's special operation lasted all of a few hours, while Putin's has been going on for almost four years and has become a way of life for his political system. And every indication now suggests that Putin believes he has the time and resources to continue “returning” the Donbas and what the Kremlin calls Novorossiya—its propaganda term for the territories of southeastern Ukraine—for months to come. To anyone trying to understand what it will take to bring Russia to a deal, it will be crucial to recognize Putin's choice.

For Russia, the story of 2025 was convergence with the United States on broader geopolitical strategy, not on ending the war. Putin was successful in imitating negotiations and turning their meaning upside down: all the major events of the year—the meeting in Anchorage, the telephone conversations with Trump, U.S. Special Envoy Steven Witkoff's political tourism—have looked like negotiations in reverse. First come the red carpets and big words, not the discussions of anything meaningful. This approach allowed the Kremlin to maintain the intensity of hostilities while keeping Trump as a partner.

In Ukraine, Putin says he is not fighting for territory, he is defending Russian people. But one of the key phrases in the Kremlin's wartime propaganda is “liberation of territories.” By now, it is clear that Putin measures his power both in spheres of influence and in territories under his control: if soft power does not achieve the desired results, then military force comes into play. The Putin doctrine has resurrected the old thinking of the nineteenth and earlier twentieth centuries, according to which the power of states was primarily measured in terms of territory and lethal weapons systems. But it looks as if Putin is not the only one.

A version of this type of thinking also forms the basis of Trump's so-called peace plan for Ukraine, with its continually changing number of points. It is also the thinking behind the notion, articulated in the longer, classified version of Trump's new National Security Strategy, to supplant the Europe- and democracy-oriented G-7 with a so-called Core 5 group of powerful countries—China, India, Japan, and Russia, alongside the United States. (In Trump's world, both political influence and wealth are sources of power, hence the inclusion of Japan in this group.) But instead of appeasing Putin—or as the NSS puts it, reestablishing “strategic stability with Russia”—such recognition of the Russian Federation merely encourages him to continue his military actions.

Of course, the U.S. operation in Venezuela somewhat complicates the new Putin doctrine. The main new question that arises is: Will Trump remain a friend, even if only a situational one? Will it still be possible for Putin to manipulate him in 2026 in the same way as he did in 2025, through Witkoff and his counterpart, Kirill Dmitriev, Russia's special presidential envoy on foreign investment and economic cooperation? The ease with which Maduro was captured demonstrated that the U.S. president can out-Putin the Russian leader himself in asserting control over his sphere of influence (although Maduro's capture is hardly proof that the Trump administration will be equally successful in the political remodeling of Venezuela).

But there is another issue: the Putin doctrine is also a shadow, albeit a pale one, of the late Soviet-era foreign policy doctrine in which a superpower must exercise interests in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Venezuela was, in this sense, an area of interest for the Kremlin. And suddenly, another superpower has laid its hands on it. This is a defeat for Putin. It does not mean that Russia will end the pseudo-negotiations over the Ukraine war or reject the United States as its mediator. But it has shown Putin another side of Trump—not a friend but an enemy. Trump further emphasized this possibility by seizing a Russian tanker for violating U.S. sanctions. Recognizing a changed dynamic could also reinforce Putin's desire to continue the war rather than end it on Trump's terms, however favorable they may be to Russia.

And here arises a question that Western analysts have been asking for four years now: At what point will the economic cost of the war in Ukraine become so great that it finally forces the Kremlin to end it? On paper and in daily life in Russia, the signs of growing economic strain are not hard to find. Both at the federal and regional levels, the country's budgets are experiencing an acute shortage of revenue. As a result, the authorities have been forcing ordinary people and businesses to pay for the war.

Over the past year, Russia's value-added tax rate has been increased to 22 percent, the purchase of imported cars is now subject to tens of thousands of dollars in additional fees (the state calls these payments “recycling,” or disposal fees), and the government has introduced a so-called technology fee on smartphones, computers, and everything that has an electronic base. At the same time, the state has cut back social spending, as defense and military outlays swallow up an ever-greater share of public expenditure. Meanwhile, utility bills are rising and in some cases doubling. At grocery stores, the prices of some goods, including frozen fish, beef, and rye bread, have risen by 20 percent or more; car sales have plummeted. Many enterprises, including the AvtoVAZ car factory, have switched to a four-day workweek. Small and medium-sized businesses are dreading tax increases and tighter tax controls.

It should be underscored that, as before, these indicators may matter little to Putin: in his view, everything is more or less normal or fixable. Even Russia's demographic crisis—a rapid population decline driven by a combination of long-term trends, pervasive uncertainty in society that has put downward pressure on the birth rate, and emigration and military losses—is not a significant problem. Nonetheless, the Kremlin clearly understands that the economy is not doing very well. And it has felt it necessary to invest heavily in those who participate in the war and their families. This includes not only large payments for joining the armed forces but also a variety of new rewards for veterans and members of their families, including free admission to universities and other preferential treatments.



By now, the relentless militarization of the economy has distorted the foundations of the Russian economy. Throughout 2025, industrial production and GDP stagnated. And this stagnation—as an average indicator for the entire economy—has been made possible only by the continued growth of defense and military sectors, such as the production of ready-made metal products, electronics, and optics. Although the stimulus effect of wartime spending is fading, inflation remains consistently high. Moreover, many Russian economists have warned that increasing the value-added tax rate can have only a short-term effect on revenue: high taxes depress economic activity and reduce consumer spending power, pushing more Russians into the shadow economy.

Putin and his foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, can insist as much as they like that the country is not isolated from the world and is in excellent contact with the “global majority.” But the economic data is unambiguous. In 2021, the last year before the war began, foreign direct investment in Russia was worth more than $40 billion; three years later, it had shrunk to $3 billion—a collapse of more than 90 percent. Of course, these stark trends as well as the total degradation of economic relations with Europe would seem to make the deals that Trump has offered Russia in exchange for a cease-fire all the more valuable. But whether the prospect of a deal with Trump remains for Putin in 2026 if he insists on continuing to achieve his goals by military means is a big question.

Russian authorities are no longer shy about saying that they need money specifically for the war. As Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, paraphrasing Tsar Alexander III, recently put it, “Russia's allies are its army, its navy, and its stable finances.” In other words, “stable finances” are necessary to fund the military. And the Kremlin will need even more money if and when huge masses of people return from the front: dealing with Russia's now vast population of war veterans will involve social support, psychological assistance, medical treatment, and job creation. The scale of the problem is enormous, not to mention the fact that ordinary Russians, many of whom have become accustomed to seeing “our boys” as heroes, are also afraid of them. For civilians, it is hard to understand the psychological state of those returning, especially those who have inflated expectations of peacetime, of the Russian state and society, and of their own status, because they fought for their homeland.

Previously, oil could take care of Russia's economic problems and provided income for the state; now, people have become the new oil. The Kremlin assumes that since Russians have adapted to war, they will also adapt to stagnation and tighten their belts so that the country can achieve victory. This has become a very unfavorable version of the social contract that has supported the Putin regime for all these years. Before the war, it was simply this: support the authorities without interfering in politics and you will have at least relative economic prosperity. Now, the contract requires total support for the authorities, and even accepting the erosion of your financial security, in exchange for the authorities simply recognizing you as a good patriot: the Russian population is expected to embrace both the continuation of war and prolonged economic stagnation.

Still, Russians seem to be tolerating it. Already, the regime has begun preparing them, including by guiding public opinion. In a recent poll, the pro-Kremlin pollster VCIOM asked: “Do you agree with the statement: ‘I feel responsible for my country and am ready to save money and limit my needs for the sake of its defense'?” Of course, for ordinary law-abiding Russians, even those who are largely indifferent to things beyond their daily lives, embracing the idea of responsibility for one's country is the socially acceptable behavior. About 69 percent of respondents to the survey answered yes.



Meanwhile, the Kremlin has tried to tighten information and communication flows even further. In recent months, it has imposed new restrictions on WhatsApp, Telegram, and VPNs and aggressively pushed Russians to switch to the state-run messenger app Max, modeled on China's WeChat. These kinds of steps are a good barometer of the Kremlin's shift from authoritarianism to totalitarianism. Roskomnadzor, the body that regulates the digital and media sphere, has sometimes seemed more menacing than the security forces. Many people are giving in and starting to use Max; nonetheless, a common strategy is to install the state-controlled app to appease the government while continuing to use the familiar messengers in their daily life. (According to data from the independent polling agency the Levada Center, in August 2025, 70 percent of Russian respondents used WhatsApp and 62 percent used Telegram, whereas the Max messenger app was used by five percent.)

For now, the state seems to believe it is unbounded in how far it can apply pressure. Throughout the war, Russians have responded to all the accumulating restrictions, repression, and censorship simply by adapting. Still, there have been pockets of resistance. In Vladivostok this fall, people protested in the streets against the scrap tax on imported cars. At the end of 2025, in St. Petersburg and other cities, a wave of street musicians performed antigovernment and antiwar songs, attracting large audiences. The authorities responded by arresting the musicians. And in Tomsk, in Siberia, children and their parents have taken to the streets to protest the blocking of the Roblox computer game platform. Who would have thought that this would be a reason for open expression of discontent? If you are not politicized, politics still comes to you. Some Russians are beginning to understand this.

The Kremlin is building an imaginary empire—if not very successfully, given that it is clear that Putin's Russia lacks the soft power to consider the South Caucasus and Central Asia as its own. But Russia is the local hegemon, and Putin knows he must compete with Trump for influence in the five Central Asian countries. Thus, as soon as the five Central Asian presidents visited Washington, Putin hosted a luxurious reception in Moscow for Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev and then took the time to fly to Kyrgyzstan. But Putin is fine with this competition—it does not contradict the idea of Trump's Core 5. So far, these are purely speculative schemes that reflect not the construction of a new world order but political confusion amid the collapse of the existing one. The impulse for this erosion has been set primarily by the conflict in Ukraine.

In this context, it is important to understand the internal Russian sources of global problems. Putin's Russia exports not only energy resources but also disorder. There is a “root cause” for this, to use Putin's own words: the internal structure of the Putin regime. Until the country becomes if not democratic, then at least rationally organized, it will remain a chaos agent on the international stage. That is why, even if a peace deal is reached in Ukraine, the West will not be able to make Putin's Russia go away. The period after the peace agreement—if and when it happens—will be no less difficult than the conflict itself: the confrontation will simply continue in a hybrid and cold form.

Regardless of what happens, the Kremlin will not stop fighting at home. By continuing political persecution and repression within the country and searching for enemies among dissidents, the regime will compensate for the stark crisis it will face with the economy, the day-to-day management of the country, and the inevitable social and economic shocks that will result from transitioning the hundreds of thousands of people returning from the trenches to peaceful civilian life.

Russia exports chaos, but so does Trump's United States, and with no less vigor. A new round in the struggle for spheres of influence has begun, with all the major parties renouncing Eurocentric policies at the same time. The difference from the classic Cold War is that no new rules have yet been set that would determine the balance of power and interests. In addition, a player more powerful than Putin's Russia—Xi Jinping's China—now has a special role to play. In this new game, the personal factor, the figures of Trump, Putin, and Xi, has become dominant. The world order cannot restrain them.

To return to the Soviet diplomat Falin: confrontation is not a fate, but a choice. Peace is also a choice. There are still not enough incentives and other factors promoting peace and stability for the current strongmen to establish rules for coexistence—with one another and with the whole world. But it is also as yet unclear what would be required for them to choose differently.

            Tesla's robotaxi service has been mostly hypothetical so far, but it's certainly taking the company's shareholders for a real ride.
    


            Tesla debuted its ride-hailing service using cars with its so-called full self-driving (FSD) tech in Austin, Texas, in June. At the rollout, CEO Elon Musk announced the ambitious goal of serving half the US population by the end of the year.
    


            But by October, that target was reduced to eight to 10 metro areas. And at the start of 2026, robotaxis are available in just two locations — Austin and the San Francisco Bay area — and a company employee needs to be along for the ride in both.
    


            Tesla did not respond to CNN questions about its service.
    


            Shares of Tesla (TSLA), meanwhile, have climbed more than 50% since June to a record-high on Musk's big promises. Musk previously said the service would greatly change the financial outlook for Tesla, making it the most valuable company on the planet.
    


            But its main source of revenue — electric vehicle (EV) sales — is sputtering, falling by a record 9% in 2025. That makes 2026 a critical year for Tesla. The company must start to live up to its bold promises on robotaxis, or risk losing much of those gains.
    


            “I think in the next six months there's a reckoning coming for Tesla,” said Ross Gerber, an early Tesla investor and CEO of investment firm Gerber Kawasaki. He's now a prominent critic of Musk.
    


            “I think once analysts realize that all these (robotaxi) numbers are fantastical and sales (of cars) are still going down, then Tesla's got a big problem,” Gerber added.
    


            American buyers rushed to buy EVs before a $7,500 tax credit expired on October 1, helping to lift Tesla's global sales to a record in the third quarter of 2025.
    


            But EV sales plunged soon after. Overall, US sales fell nearly 50% between the third and fourth quarters, according to Cox Automotive.
    


            That left Tesla's global car sales down 16% in the same period, and lower for the second straight year. That's a stunning turnaround for a company that at one time had seen nearly 50% increases in sales each year.
    


            Tesla's problems went beyond the end of a tax credit. There was backlash to Musk's political activities and involvement in the Trump administration, as well as increased competition, especially from China. Chinese automaker BYD even overtook Tesla as the world's largest seller of EVs despite not selling in the United States.
    


            That makes Musk's robotaxi hopes so critical. But overpromising is a long tradition of the CEO, who had said the robotaxi service was on the verge of launching since 2019.
    


            And Tesla is falling further behind the offerings of other companies, like Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google parent Alphabet.
    


            Waymo said it provided 14 million fully autonomous paid rides without any employees aboard in 2025, totaling 20 million over the past five years. Meanwhile, Tesla has yet to offer a single fully autonomous robotaxi ride. The Waymo service is also available in five metro areas: Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Phoenix and San Francisco.
    


            Yet Waymo's clear market advantage has not deterred Wall Street optimism for Tesla's robotaxi service.
    


            “I believe we will have 30 cities for the robotaxis in 2026,” said Dan Ives, analyst for Wedbush Securities and a Tesla bull. “You need to use a brick-by-brick process to build out the most important of growth in Tesla's history.”
    


            Such bullish assessments seem to discount a less-than-ideal initial rollout. The Austin service has reported eight accidents to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, even with employees in the car.
    


            The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is also conducting a number of investigations into the safety of its autonomous driving features, adding to critics' concerns that Tesla's robotaxis won't be safe enough to operate everywhere Musk promises.
    


            “He's benefited from putting out promises that are impossible to meet. He's not going to deliver,” said Gordon Johnson, an analyst and leading critic of Tesla and Musk. “When you have a company losing cash in their core business, and not delivering on any of the promises, people are going to start to sell.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Scott Adams, ‘Dilbert' comic creator, dies","https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/13/entertainment/scott-adams-death-cec","Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:54:02 GMT","


            Scott Adams, the creator of the popular comic strip “Dilbert,” has died, according to an announcement on his social media pages.
    


            Adams announced in May that he'd been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer.
    


            “Dilbert,” a chronicle of the indignities of American office work, was one of the country's most widely read comic strips from its breakout success in the 1990s until February 2023, when Adams made racist comments against Black Americans, calling them a “hate group” that white people should “get the hell away from,” in response to a dubious poll about whether it's “OK to be white.” Hundreds of newspapers stopped carrying “Dilbert” within days, and the strip was soon dropped by its distributor.
    


            Adams began self-publishing the strip, in a “spicier version” called “Dilbert Reborn,” on his website for a subscription fee. He stopped drawing “Dilbert” in November 2025 due to cramping and partial paralysis in his hands, he said, though he continued to write the strips.
    


            Adams' ex-wife Shelly Miles announced his death on Tuesday's episode of the livestream “Coffee with Scott Adams,” which he hosted daily until his death, with a written statement from Adams.
    


            “I had an amazing life,” Scott Adams wrote in the statement, composed on New Year's Day. “I gave it everything I had. If I get any benefits from my work, I'm asking that you pay it forward as best as you can. That's the legacy I want. Be useful, and please know, I loved you all to the very end.”
    


            Adams, a New York native, worked as a bank teller from 1979 until 1986, the same year he graduated with an MBA from the University of California, Berkeley. (He was twice held at gunpoint as a teller, he wrote in the 20-year retrospective “Dilbert 2.0.”) He debuted “Dilbert” in 1989 while working as an engineer at the telephone company Pacific Bell, whose sterile setting and zany employees inspired his strip.
    


            “For the future of ‘Dilbert,' you could say that the group I was in was a target-rich environment,” he told EE Times, an electronics industry publication, in 2005.
    


            “Dilbert” didn't become a hit until a few years into its run, when Adams started to set most of its strips in his bespectacled office drone's workplace. “It wasn't exactly what I wanted to do, but it worked,” he told the Associated Press when he won the National Cartoonists Society's Reuben award for the best comic strip of 1997.
    


            He credited Dilbert's blankness — his absence of visible eyes, for one, but also the lack of any particulars about his location or role at his company — with making the strip so popular.
    


            “People have no reason to think it's not just like their experience,” Adams told EE Times. “For instance, there are both engineers and programmers who are convinced Dilbert is one of them.”
    


            And for decades, “Dilbert” was. Readers recognized their own upward-failing managers in Dilbert's clueless “pointy-haired boss,” or identified with the everyman hero's losing battle against incompetence in meetings with his dim coworkers. Adams included his email address in strips for years to gather stories from readers struggling in their own offices, material that “keeps me going,” he told the New Yorker in 2008.
    


            Following the success of the strip, Adams felt unstoppable: “For a while, everything I touched turned to gold,” he told Bloomberg in 2017.
    


            Confident in his ability to sell just about anything, he entered the food business, with much less success. In 1997, he opened a restaurant near his California home called Stacey's Cafe. He eventually took over as boss at its sister location, where employees described him to the New York Times as “dramatically clueless about the harsh realities of the restaurant industry,” despite his many years satirizing oblivious bosses. Both Stacey's locations went “belly-up” sometime before 2017, per Bloomberg.
    


            He was also briefly the purveyor of the “Dilberito,” a frozen vegetarian burrito named for his cartoon and marketed as a nutrient-packed alternative to unhealthy microwavable meals. (The AV Club in 2020 remembered the product as “stomach-ruining.”) The Dilberito, launched in 1999, was discontinued in 2003. Adams told the New Yorker a few years later that “the world wasn't interested in being healthy, so I got out of that business eventually.”

Live Updates


• US President Donald Trump has canceled meetings with Iranian officials and encouraged protesters to keep demonstrating, saying “help is on its way” amid a brutal crackdown by Tehran. At least 1,850 protesters have now been killed in more than two weeks of demonstrations, according to a US-based rights group.
    


• Trump will meet with his senior national security team today to discuss his options in Iran, after announcing a 25% tariff on countries that do business with Iran. Meanwhile, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he believes the Iranian regime could be facing its “last days and weeks.”
    


• Some landline and mobile phone users in Iran have been able to call abroad for the first time more than four days after the government shut down communications. But internet access remains cut off for a fifth day.
    


            President Trump did not attend a Tuesday morning meeting of national security principals regarding Iran, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Air Force One on the way to Michigan.
    


            Trump is giving remarks on the economy in Detroit, where Leavitt said Trump is likely to mention Iran.
    


            CNN previously reported Trump was expected to convene senior national security officials to discuss how to proceed in Iran, but Leavitt said Tuesday he hadn't been scheduled to attend this morning's meeting with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, among others.
    


            Earlier Tuesday, Trump said on Truth Social that he's canceled all meetings with Iranian officials until “the senseless killing of protestors STOP.”
    


            Trump had said on Sunday that Iran called to negotiate, adding that a meeting was being set up.
    


            Fears are growing that the number of people killed in Iran's protest is much higher than what has been publicly reported, but with the country largely cut off from the internet, only a portion of the deaths can be confirmed.
    


            In an update today, the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said at least 1,850 protesters have been killed and at least 16,784 have been arrested since the unrest began in December.
    


            HRANA has told CNN that its figures are based only on cases it has been able to identify and verify. But with Iran largely offline, the actual toll could be much higher.
    


            Internet monitoring group NetBlocks says the country has been without internet access for five days, since authorities imposed a nationwide shutdown last week — severely limiting the flow of images, videos and witness accounts.
    


            Despite the blackout, CNN has been able to reach some people on the ground when brief landline and mobile calls become available. Multiple eyewitnesses have described violent crackdowns on protesters and “chaotic” conditions inside hospitals.
    


            Rare video that surfaced over the weekend from inside Kahrizak Forensic Medical Center appears to show people crowded around a monitor, looking to identify their loved ones.
    


For context: Internet shutdowns are a core tactic of the regime's playbook during periods of unrest. In 2019, Iran went almost entirely offline after nationwide protests gripped the country. And in the wake of 22-year-old's Mahsa Amini's death in 2022, the regime shut down the internet, making it harder to document what was happening on the ground.

            Iran has been under a near-total internet blackout for five days, according to cybersecurity watchdog NetBlocks, as authorities crack down on anti-government protesters.
    


            Earlier today, telephone communications appeared to have been partially restored, with some landline and mobile phone users able to call abroad for the first time since the blackout began last week.
    


            Alp Toker, director of NetBlocks, told CNN earlier in the week: “National blackouts tend to be the regime's go-to strategy when deadly force is about to get used against protesters, with the goal being to prevent the spread of news of what's happening on ground, and also to limit international scrutiny.”
    


            At least 1,850 protesters have been killed, according to estimates from the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA).
    


            A number of European nations have summoned Iranian ambassadors and are condemning Tehran's violent clampdown on protesters.
    


Here's what the countries are saying: 



CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq, Catherine Nicholls and Inke Kappeler contributed to this report. 



            The United Kingdom will work towards carrying out more sanctions against Iran, British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said today, in response to what she called the “most brutal and bloody repression against public protest in Iran for at least thirteen years.”
    


                    “The United Kingdom condemns in the strongest of terms the horrendous and brutal killing of Iranian protestors and we demand that the Iranian authorities respect the fundamental rights and freedoms of their citizens,” Cooper said in a statement to the British parliament today.
                





            The UK's minister for the Middle East has summoned the Iranian ambassador to “underline the gravity of this moment and to call on Iran to answer for the horrific reports that we are hearing,” she said.
    


            London will also “bring forward legislation to implement full and further sanctions and sectoral measures” against Iran, which will target its finance, energy, transport and software sectors, and others “which are advancing Iranian nuclear escalation,” she said.
    


            Iran's largest protests in three years are calling for new leadership and substantive change in the country.
    


            But some of the chants we're hearing now differ from the “Women, Life, Freedom” rallying cries of 2022, sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini, the young woman arrested by Iran's morality police.
    


CNN's Clarissa Ward breaks it down here:


Protests continue across Iran despite a brutal crackdown that includes threats to execute demonstrators and a climbing death toll. CNN's Clarissa Ward breaks down some of the protest chants we have been hearing.


            We've recently received an updated death toll estimate from a US-based human rights group, which says more than 1,800 protesters have been killed during just over two weeks of anti-government demonstrations in Iran.
    


            To put that estimate into context, these are the estimated deaths from other times of unrest:
    


            As we reported earlier, US President Donald Trump announced that countries doing business with Iran will face a new 25% tariff.



            He did not define what qualifies as “doing business” with Iran and the post raised a number of questions, including how these additional tariffs could work, which countries would be targeted and whether services and not just goods would face higher duties.
    


            China is Iran's biggest trade partner, purchasing more than $4 billion worth of products in 2023, according to The Observatory of Economic Complexity.
    


            The US currently has a minimum 20% tariff on goods from China, following a trade war last year which saw Chinese imports attract a minimum tariff of 145% at its peak. The country could now face levies starting at 45%.
    


            Iran exports goods to more than 120 countries around the world, 91% of which go to Asia. European countries account for 8% of exports, with the rest of the world making up the remaining 1%.
    


            Experts appointed by the United Nations Human Rights Council are urging Iran to refrain from using lethal force against demonstrators, following what it describes as “clear violations” of human rights law.
    


                    “The use of lethal force against peaceful protesters, arbitrary arrests – including of children – and attacks on medical facilities represent clear violations of international human rights law,” the experts said, according to a news release from the Special Procedures United Nations Human Rights Council.
                





            Responding to reports of death sentences being issued against protesters, the experts said, “If implemented, this compounds the reported unlawful killings of protesters by security forces on the streets with state-sanctioned executions.”
    


            The working group also raised concerns over the rhetoric being used to label demonstrators, like “rioters,” and said that inflammatory language should not be used to “suppress or criminalize legitimate demonstrations.”
    


                    “Authorities have a choice between perpetuating cycles of violence and repression that have characterised past responses to dissent or establishing genuine respect for fundamental rights,” the group of experts said.
                





            According to the UN Human Rights Council, the experts are in contact with Iranian authorities and “call for immediate action to prevent further human rights violations.”
    


            Earlier, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said Iranian officials' threats to punish protesters with the death penalty, were “extremely worrying.”
    


            On Friday, Tehran's prosecutor Ali Salehi said some protesters in Iran could face the death penalty for their actions, according to the semi-official news agency Tasnim.
    


CNN's Billy Stockwell and Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report.



            President Donald Trump said today he's canceled any meetings with Iranian officials as a crackdown on protesters continues, suggesting the window of diplomacy that he saw opening days ago had closed.
    


            In a message on Truth Social, Trump encouraged protesters to keep up the demonstrations, and said “help is on the way.”
    


            “Iranian Patriots, KEEP PROTESTING - TAKE OVER YOUR INSTITUTIONS!!!” Trump wrote.
    


            “Save the names of the killers and abusers. They will pay a big price,” he went on. “I have cancelled all meetings with Iranian Officials until the senseless killing of protesters STOPS. HELP IS ON ITS WAY.”
    


            He ended by writing “MIGA,” or Make Iran Great Again.
    


            On Sunday, Trump suggested he was open to talks with the Iranian regime after receiving communication over the weekend. He said a meeting was being set up.
    


            But his message two days later indicated he no longer believes talks would be fruitful.
    


            At least 1,850 protesters have been killed in more than two weeks of anti-government demonstrations in Iran, according to US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA).
    


            This is a significant increase from the group's previous toll of around 500. HRANA also said at least 16,784 had been arrested.
    


            It remains unclear whether HRANA's tally fully captures the scale of casualties and arrests, given the authorities' shutdown of internet access and telephone lines.
    


            CNN is unable to independently verify HRANA's death toll or arrest figures.
    


            When President Donald Trump meets with his senior national security team later Tuesday to discuss his options in Iran, he'll face a complex set of decisions for how to proceed – all balanced by an equally complex set of risks.
    


            Trump must first decide whether to allow diplomacy time to proceed after his foreign envoy, Steve Witkoff, received conciliatory messages from Iran's foreign minister over the weekend.
    


            Some senior officials interpreted the outreach as a sign the regime was ready to talk and have encouraged the president to seize the opportunity to strike a deal (the contours of which remain unclear).
    


            Other officials have been less sanguine, believing Tehran is simply looking to delay an attack, which Trump has been threatening for more than two weeks.
    


            Trump has said he won't necessarily wait for talks with Iran before moving ahead. If he decides to go that course, he will have to consider another set of decisions.
    


            Should Trump decide on firing a missile into Iran, he will have to decide which targets to strike – remaining elements of Iran's nuclear program, government buildings in Tehran or other facilities connected to the country's security services. Any strike would likely be several days from happening, one official said.
    


            If Trump elects to carry out something short of a strike, he has another set of options in front of him: cyberattacks, new sanctions or efforts to bolster internet connectivity.
    


            Each cascading decision will be weighed against potential responses from Iran. US officials believe any strikes inside Iran could lead to retaliatory action on American facilities in the region, an outcome Iranian officials have already threatened. Officials have also voiced concern that a forceful response could strengthen support for the regime in a “rally behind the flag” effect.
    


            It's less clear how Iran might respond to lesser actions. And not taking any action at all could make Trump's threats appear empty, officials said.
    


            Pro-regime demonstrators in the Iranian capital Tehran have acknowledged the economic plight gripping the country but backed authorities' line that “foreign interventions” have amplified the unrest.
    


                    “I believe (the unrest) was generally a plot by the United States and Israel, but people do have issues that need to be heard,” an unnamed pro-government protester told Reuters at a counter-rally yesterday.
                





            Protests over the government's handling of the economy began more than two weeks ago in Tehran's bazaars but spread to more than 180 cities and towns, morphing into general protests against the regime. In response, counter-rallies in support of the government took place across Iran on Monday.
    


            Another pro-regime protester acknowledged that Iran was facing “excessive inflation,” but added: “All that said, I am here, participating, to defend my country.”
    


            Iranian authorities have sought to differentiate between economic protesters and those calling for regime change, branding the latter as “rioters” and foreign-backed “mercenaries.”
    


            A third pro-regime protester said, “the first step is to speak with determination about possible foreign interventions.”
    


                    “The next step is to respond to the rightful objections that we the people have regarding the state of the economy. Talk to the people and answer them with honesty,” the protester added.
                





            US President Donald Trump has repeatedly issued warnings to Iranian leadership over the last few weeks, threatening that his country could intervene if authorities continue their violence against protesters.
    


            Here's a look at some of the exchanges between Trump and Iranian leadership since the start of this year:
    


CNN's Mostafa Salem, Tim Lister, Billy Stockwell, Nadeen Ebrahim, Kit Maher, Chris Lau, Piper Hudspeth Blackburn, Helen Regan, Banafsheh Keynoush and Elisabeth Buchwald contributed to this reporting.



            The Dutch foreign minister has summoned Iran's ambassador to protest Iran's brutal crackdown of anti-government protests, the first European government to announce such a move.
    


            “I have summoned the Iranian ambassador to formally protest the excessive violence against peaceful protesters, large-scale arbitrary arrests and internet shutdowns,” David van Weel said on Tuesday in a statement posted on X.
    


            Van Weel called on Tehran to “respect fundamental rights and immediately restore internet access,” after Iranians have been cut off for at least 108 hours, according to internet-monitoring group NetBlocks.
    


            Iran's foreign ministry summoned the ambassadors of the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and France yesterday to protest their governments' public support for the protests, according to an Iranian state broadcaster.
    


            At least 500 demonstrators, including nine minors, have been killed and more than 10,000 have been arrested since the protests began in late December, according to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency. CNN cannot independently verify those figures. Iranian state-affiliated media say more than 100 members of the security forces have been killed.
    


CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq and Hira Humayun contributed to this report



            Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has called on the German government to “have some shame” after Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the Iranian regime could be facing its “last days and weeks.”



                    “Of all governments, the one in Germany is perhaps the worst placed to address ‘human rights,'” Araghchi posted on X Tuesday. “The reason is simple: its blatant double-standards over the past years have obliterated any shred of credibility.”
                





            Merz earlier criticized the Iranian government, saying that “when a regime can only stay in power through violence then it has de facto reached the end.”
    


            Araghchi said Berlin should “end its unlawful interference in our region,” while condemning Merz' support for Israel during its war in Gaza following Hamas' deadly October 7, 2023, attacks on southern Israel.
    


            After a communications blackout lasted for more than four days, we are slowly beginning to hear more from those on the ground in Iran.
    


Here are some of the key developments in the last 24 hours:



CNN's Elisabeth Buchwald, Rhea Mogul, Helen Regan, Billy Stockwell and Zahid Mahmood contributed to this reporting.



            Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi says the Islamic Republic is “ready” should the US want to “test military action” against the country.
    


                    “We are ready for any action. If they want to test military action, which they tested once and achieved no results, we are ready for that,” Araghchi said in an interview with Al Jazeera Arabic on Monday, adding that Iran is now more prepared to face strikes on its soil, compared to the 12-day war with Israel in June.
                





            US President Donald Trump is weighing a series of potential military options in Iran following deadly protests in the country, two US officials told CNN, as the US president considers following through on his recent threats to strike the Iranian regime should it use lethal force against civilians during recent protests.
    


            Araghchi also said in the interview that “January 8 should be considered an extension of the 12-day war” with Israel, explaining much of the lethal crackdown employed by the regime against protesters, many of whom are accused of collaborating with Israel.
    


            Araghchi said Iran is, however, willing to engage in diplomatic talks, and that Tehran hopes Washington will choose a “wise option.” Trump had said that Iran called him on Saturday to negotiate.
    


            UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk has described as “extremely worrying” statements from Iranian officials that protesters could face the death penalty.
    


                    “It (is) also extremely worrying to see public statements by some judicial officials indicating the possibility of the death penalty being used against protesters through expedited judicial proceedings,” Türk said in a statement published on Tuesday.
                





            On Friday, Tehran's prosecutor Ali Salehi said that some protesters in Iran could face the death penalty for their actions, according to the semi-official news agency Tasnim.
    


            Turk cited reports that several hospitals in Iran were “overwhelmed” by the number of casualties, including children, amid the anti-regime protests across the country.
    


                    “The killing of peaceful demonstrators must stop, and the labelling of protesters as ‘terrorists' to justify violence against them is unacceptable,” Türk said.
                





            As with Iranian protests in 2022, Türk said the reaction from Iran's authorities has been to “inflict brutal force to repress legitimate demands for change.”
    


            The UN human rights chief urged the Iranian authorities to “halt immediately all forms of violence and repression” and called for accountability for “serious violations.”
    


            As protests stretched into Monday night across multiple Iranian cities, this footage shows crowds chanting in the streets — and by morning, images of a burned-out bank were a visual reminder of anger at the government and the country's economic crisis.
    


            Video from the central city of Karaj released overnight by pro-reform activist outlet IranWire appears to show demonstrators marching and chanting, “by the end of the week Seyyed Ali is gone!” This is a reference to the full name of the country's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei.
    


            In Ahvaz, southwestern Iran, multiple videos show crowds marching, clapping and chanting pro-reform slogans, including “this is the last battle – Pahlavi is coming back” and “this is the year of blood Seyyed Ali will be overthrown.”
    


            In Tehran a separate video shows a group chanting anti-government slogans, fire was also seen around the demonstrators.
    


            By morning, more footage from the capital shows Melli Bank, one of Iran's largest state-owned banks, burned and blackened from the protests.

            The Defense Department has spent more than a year testing a device purchased in an undercover operation that some investigators think could be the cause of a series of mysterious ailments impacting US spies, diplomats and troops that are colloquially known as Havana Syndrome, according to four sources briefed on the matter.
    


            A division of the Department of Homeland Security, Homeland Security Investigations, purchased the device for millions of dollars in the waning days of the Biden administration, using funding provided by the Defense Department, according to two of the sources. Officials paid “eight figures” for the device, these people said, declining to offer a more specific number.
    


            The device is still being studied and there is ongoing debate — and in some quarters of government, skepticism — over its link to the roughly dozens of anomalous health incidents that remain officially unexplained.
    


            CNN has asked the Pentagon, HSI and the DHS for comment. The CIA declined to comment.
    


            The device acquired by HSI produces pulsed radio waves, one of the sources said, which some officials and academics have speculated for years could be the cause of the incidents. Although the device is not entirely Russian in origin, it contains Russian components, this person added.
    


            Officials have long struggled to understand how a device powerful enough to cause the kind of damage some victims have reported could be made portable; that remains a core question, according to one of the sources briefed on the device. The device could fit in a backpack, this person said.
    


            The acquisition of the device has reignited a painful and contentious debate within the US government about Havana Syndrome, known officially as “anomalous health episodes.”
    


            The mysterious illness first emerged in late 2016, when a cluster of US diplomats stationed in the Cuban capital of Havana began reporting symptoms consistent with head trauma, including vertigo and extreme headaches. In subsequent years, there have been cases reported around the world.
    


            In the subsequent decade the intelligence community and the Defense Department have sought to understand if those officials were the victims of some kind of directed energy attack by a foreign government — with senior intelligence officials saying publicly that there wasn't enough evidence to support that conclusion and victims arguing that the US government has gaslit them and ignored important evidence that Russia was attacking American government officials.
    


            Still, defense officials considered their findings serious enough that they briefed the House and Senate Intelligence Committees late last year, including reference to the acquired device and its testing.
    


            One key concern now for some officials is that if the technology proves viable it may have proliferated, several of the sources said, meaning that more than one country could now have access to a device that may be capable of causing career-ending injuries to US officials.
    


            CNN was not able to learn where — or from whom — HSI purchased the device, but HSI has a history of collaboration with the Defense Department for operations that take place all over the globe. The office has broad jurisdiction to investigate crimes linked to customs violations, including investigations into the proliferation of US-controlled technology or expertise overseas.
    


            Those investigations are “the single biggest collaboration point between HSI and the US military,” according to a former Homeland Security official.
    


            For example, when the US military came across US technology in Afghanistan or Iraq that raised questions about how those components came to the region, it would turn to HSI, according to the official.
    


            It was also not clear how the US government learned of the existence of the device in order to purchase it. Havana Syndrome — and its cause — have remained frustratingly opaque to both the intelligence community and the medical community.
    


            One problem facing the medical community is that there is still not a clear definition of “anomalous health incidents” or AHIs. Tests were done, in some cases, long after symptoms began, making it harder to understand what physically happened.
    


            In 2022, an intelligence panel investigating the cause of AHIs said that some of the episodes could “plausibly” have been caused by “pulsed electromagnetic energy” emitted by an external source.
    


            But in 2023, the intelligence community said publicly that it could not link any cases to a foreign adversary, ruling it unlikely that the unexplained illness was the result of a targeted campaign by an enemy of the US. As recently as January of 2025, the broader intelligence community assessment remained that it was very unlikely that the symptoms were caused by a foreign actor — even as an official with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence emphasized that analysts cannot “rule out” the possibility in some small number of cases.
    


            That stance has long incensed victims, many of whom believe strongly that intelligence exists offering black-and-white evidence that Russia is behind their symptoms, some of which have been severe enough to force retirement.
    


            Some current and former CIA officers have raised concerns that the agency soft-pedaled its investigation, CNN has previously reported.
    


            The acquisition of the device has been treated by some victims as potential vindication.
    


            “If the [US government] has indeed uncovered such devices, then the CIA owes all the victims a f**king major and public apology for how we have been treated as pariahs,” Marc Polymeropoulos, one of the first CIA officers to go public with injuries he says he sustained in an attack in Moscow in 2017, said in a statement to CNN.

            A much-loved annual literary festival has been canceled after more than 180 writers quit the program to protest the dumping of a Palestinian Australian author, whose invitation was withdrawn due to “cultural sensitivities” following the Bondi Beach terror attack.
    


            Adelaide Writers' Week has been mired in controversy since late last week when the board announced Randa Abdel-Fattah, a prominent critic of Israel's war in Gaza, was no longer invited to attend “given her past statements.”
    


            “Whilst we do not suggest in any way that Dr Randa Abdel-Fattah's or her writings have any connection with the tragedy at Bondi, given her past statements we have formed the view that it would not be culturally sensitive to continue to program her at this unprecedented time so soon after Bondi,” said the statement issued on January 8.



            Following the statement, three board members quit, plus its chair and director, and a slew of high-profile participants including British novelist Zadie Smith, American Pulitzer-prize winning author Percival Everett, former New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, and popular Australian authors Helen Garner and Trent Dalton.
    


            As the backlash grew, the organizers of Adelaide Writers' Week released a statement Tuesday saying it regretted the “distress” the decision had caused and apologized to Abdel-Fattah for how it “was represented.”
    


            “This is not about identity or dissent but rather a continuing rapid shift in the national discourse around the breadth of freedom of expression in our nation following Australia's worst terror attack in history,” the statement said.
    


            Abdel-Fattah, a Future Fellow in the Department of Sociology at Macquarie University, with an expertise in Islamophobia and the author of 12 books, rejected the apology in a post on X.



            “Once again, the Board citing the ‘national discourse' for an action that specifically targets me, a Palestinian Australian Muslim woman, is explicitly articulating that I cannot be part of the national discourse, which is insulting and racist in the extreme,” she said.
    


            The furor highlights the tensions in Australia as the government scrambles to unite the country after two gunmen targeted a Jewish gathering at Bondi Beach in Sydney on December 14, killing 15 people in an attack the Jewish community said was a direct result of the government's failure to stamp out antisemitism.
    


            After the attack, authorities in New South Wales (NSW) drew a link between the mass shooting and pro-Palestinian protests held weekly since Israel launched retaliatory attacks on Hamas in Gaza for its murderous assault on Israelis on October 7, 2023.
    


            The Australian Palestine Advocacy Network slammed any conflation of the protests and the attacks as “irresponsible and misleading,” and said the government's move to tighten protest laws in its wake “represents a serious and dangerous erosion of democratic rights.”
    


            Abdel-Fattah had been booked to speak at Adelaide Writers' Week about her new book “Discipline,” which charts the lives of two characters – an academic and a journalist – in Australia during the Gaza war.
    


            Its description reads: “Silence is complicity, and the cost of speaking up is everything… ‘Discipline' tallies the price we all pay when those with privilege choose to remain silent.”
    


            Abdel-Fattah has previously angered some members of the Jewish community by saying that Zionists have “no claim or right to cultural safety.” In 2024, she was criticized for speaking at an event a pro-Palestinian protest camp at the University of Sydney, where children were heard calling for an intifada.
    


            In a X post at the time, Abdel-Fattah said that 15,000 children had been killed in Gaza, and that children at the protest had been offered the megaphone “to lead chants of their choosing, hoping to give them a sense of agency in a moment of distress.”
    


            The Executive Council of Australian Jewry (ECAJ), which represents about 200 Jewish groups, attacked the event, and Abdel-Fattah's role in it, and called for an inquiry into antisemitism in universities.
    


            The ECAJ didn't immediately respond to a request for comment over the cancelation of Adelaide Writers' Week.
    


            In its statement, the Adelaide Festival Board said it was committed to rebuilding trust with the artistic community and audience to enable “open and respectful discussions” at future Adelaide Writers' Week events.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Tuesday that they will refuse to comply with a congressional subpoena to testify in a House committee's investigation of Jeffrey Epstein.

The Clintons, in a letter released on social media, slammed the House Oversight probe as “legally invalid” even as Republican lawmakers prepared contempt of Congress proceedings against them. The Clintons wrote that the chair of the House Oversight Committee, Republican Rep. James Comer, is on the cusp of a process “literally designed to result in our imprisonment.”

“We will forcefully defend ourselves,” wrote the Clintons, who are Democrats. They accused Comer of allowing other former officials to provide written statements about Epstein to the committee, while selectively enforcing subpoenas against them.

Comer said he'll begin contempt of Congress proceedings next week. It potentially starts a complicated and politically messy process that Congress has rarely reached for and could result in prosecution from the Justice Department. 

“No one's accusing the Clintons of any wrongdoing. We just have questions,” Comer told reporters after Bill Clinton did not show up for a scheduled deposition at House offices Tuesday.

He added, “Anyone would admit they spent a lot of time together.”

Clinton has never been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein but had a well-documented friendship with the wealthy financier throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. Republicans have zeroed in on that relationship as they wrestle with demands for a full accounting of Epstein's wrongdoing.




Epstein was arrested in 2019 on federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges. He killed himself in a New York jail cell while awaiting trial.

“We have tried to give you the little information we have. We've done so because Mr. Epstein's crimes were horrific,” the Clintons wrote in the letter.

Multiple former presidents have voluntarily testified before Congress, but none has been compelled to do so. That history was invoked by President Donald Trump in 2022, between his first and second terms, when he faced a subpoena by the House committee investigating the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, riot by a mob of his supporters at the U.S. Capitol.

Trump's lawyers cited decades of legal precedent they said shielded an ex-president from being ordered to appear before Congress. The committee ultimately withdrew its subpoena.

Comer also indicated that the Oversight committee would not attempt to compel testimony from Trump about Epstein, saying that it could not force a sitting president to testify.

Trump, a Republican, also had a well-documented friendship with Epstein. He has said he cut off that relationship before Epstein was accused of sexual abuse.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — An independent counsel on Tuesday demanded the death sentence for former South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on rebellion charges in connection with his short-lived imposition of martial law in December 2024.

Yoon, who was removed from office last April and is in jail, faces eight trials over various criminal charges related to his martial law debacle and other scandals that flared during his time in office. Charges that he directed a rebellion are the most significant ones.

Independent counsel Cho Eun-suk's team requested the Seoul Central District Court to sentence Yoon to death, according to the court, which is expected to deliver a verdict in February. 

During Tuesday's court session, Park Eok-su, a senior investigator on Cho's team, described Yoon's decree as “anti-state activities” and “a self-coup.” He alleged that Yoon's action was designed to prolong his rule by neutralizing the constitutional structure of state governance systems.

AP correspondent Julie Walker reports South Korea's former president faces a possible death penalty.

Experts say the court will likely sentence Yoon to life in prison. South Korea hasn't executed anyone since 1997, and local courts rarely issue the death penalty in recent years.

Yoon is the first South Korean president who has faced a potential death penalty after leaving office, since former military strongman Chun Doo-hwan in 1996 was sentenced to death for various crimes. Chun's death sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment, and he was eventually pardoned and released. 

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




Yoon was scheduled to make remarks at Tuesday's hearing. Yoon, a conservative, has maintained that his decree was a desperate yet peaceful attempt to raise public awareness about what he considered the danger of the liberal opposition Democratic Party, which used its legislative majority to obstruct his agenda. He called the opposition-controlled parliament “a den of criminals” and “anti-state forces.”

Yoon's decree, the first of its kind in more than 40 years, brought armed troops into Seoul streets to encircle the National Assembly and enter election offices. That evoked traumatic memories of dictatorships in the 1970s and 1980s, when military-backed rulers used martial law and other emergency decrees to station soldiers and armored vehicles in public places to suppress pro-democracy protests.

On the night of Yoon's martial law declaration, thousands of people gathered at the National Assembly to object to the decree and demand his resignation. Enough lawmakers, including members of Yoon's ruling party, managed to enter an assembly hall to vote down the decree.

Observers described Yoon's action as political suicide, marking a spectacular downfall for the former star prosecutor who won South Korea's presidency in 2022, a year after entering politics. The National Assembly impeached him and sent the case to the Constitutional Court, which ruled to dismiss him as president.

Yoon's decree and ensuing power vacuum plunged South Korea into political turmoil, halted the country's high-level diplomacy and rattled its financial markets. 

Lee Jae Myung, a former Democratic Party leader who led Yoon's impeachment bid, became president in a snap election last June. After taking office, Lee appointed three independent counsels to delve into allegations involving Yoon, his wife and associates.

The president's office said Tuesday it expects the judiciary branch to rule on Yoon in line with the law, principle and public expectations. 

There had been speculation that Yoon resorted to martial law to protect his wife, Kim Keon Hee, from potential corruption investigations. But in wrapping up a six-month investigation last month, independent counsel Cho's team concluded that Yoon plotted for over a year to impose martial law to eliminate his political rivals and monopolize power.

Yoon's rebellion charges carry either the death sentence or life imprisonment, if convicted. But judges have some leeway and can commute the sentence to as little as 10 years in prison if they choose.

Cho's team last month requested a 10-year prison term for Yoon's earlier defiance of authorities' attempts to execute his detainment warrant and other charges like abuse of power and falsification of official documents. Yoon's lawyers accused Cho's team of being politically driven and lacking legal grounds to demand such an “excessive” sentence.

One of Yoon's other trials deals with charges like ordering drone flights over North Korea to deliberately inflame animosities to look for a pretext to declare martial law. Charges at other trials accuse Yoon of manipulating the investigation into a marine's drowning in 2023 and receiving free opinion surveys from an election broker in return for a political favor.

Yoon denies all the charges.

Potential prison sentences that Yoon could receive in these trials could matter in the event that he avoids the death penalty or life imprisonment over his rebellion charges, said Park SungBae, a lawyer who specializes in criminal law.

Both Yoon and the independent counsel could appeal the rebellion case to a higher court and then the Supreme Court. Park said a verdict by the Supreme Court, the country's top court, would likely come this year. 

Dozens of high-level officials and military commanders of the Yoon administration have been arrested, indicted or investigated over their roles in Yoon's martial law imposition and other allegations. Cho's team on Tuesday demanded a life sentence for Yoon's defense minister, Kim Yong Hyun, and 10-30 years in prison for former senior military and police officers.

UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United States accused Russia on Monday of a “dangerous and inexplicable escalation” of its nearly four-year war in Ukraine at a time when the Trump administration is trying to advance negotiations toward peace.

U.S. deputy ambassador to the United Nations Tammy Bruce singled out Russia's launch of a nuclear-capable Oreshnik ballistic missile last week close to Ukraine's border with Poland, a NATO ally.

She told an emergency meeting of the Security Council that the United States deplores “the staggering number of casualties” in the conflict and condemns Russia's intensifying attacks on energy and other infrastructure.

Ukraine called for the meeting after last Thursday's overnight Russian bombardment with hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles, including the powerful, new hypersonic Oreshnik missile, which Moscow used for only the second time in what was a clear warning to Kyiv's NATO allies.

The large-scale attack came days after Ukraine and its allies reported major progress toward agreeing on how to defend the country from further Moscow aggression if a U.S.-led peace deal is struck.

The attack also coincided with a new chill in relations between Moscow and Washington after Russia condemned the U.S. seizure of an oil tanker in the North Atlantic. And it came as U.S. President Donald Trump signaled he is on board with a hard-hitting sanctions package meant to economically cripple Russia.




Moscow has given no public signal it is willing to budge from its maximalist demands on Ukraine. And Russia's U.N. ambassador on Monday blamed the diplomatic impasse on Ukraine. 

Europe's leaders condemned the attack using the Oreshnik as “escalatory and unacceptable,” and U.S. envoy Bruce was equally tough on Monday.

“At a moment of tremendous potential, due only to President Trump's unparalleled commitment to peace around the world, both sides should be seeking ways to de-escalate,” she said. “Yet Russia's action risks expanding and intensifying the war.”

Bruce reminded Russia that nearly a year ago it voted in favor of a Security Council resolution calling for an end to the conflict in Ukraine.

“It would be nice if Russia matched their words with deeds,” she said. “In the spirit of that resolution, Russia, Ukraine and Europe must pursue peace seriously and bring this nightmare to an end.”

But Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council that until Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy “comes to his senses and agrees to realistic conditions for negotiations, we will continue solving the problem by military means.”

“He was warned long ago, with each passing day, each day which he squanders, the conditions for negotiations will only get worse for him,” Nebenzia said. “Similarly, each vile attack on Russian civilians will elicit a stiff response.”

Ukraine's U.N. Ambassador Andriy Melnyk countered that Russia is more vulnerable now than at any time since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. Its economy is slowing and oil revenue is down. 

“Russia wants to sell to this council and the whole U.N. family the impression that it is invincible, but this is another illusion,” he told the council. “The carefully staged image of strength is nothing but smoke and mirrors, completely detached from reality.”

Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss Iran's deadly protests as the Trump administration weighs potential military action.

President Donald Trump urged the people of Iran to ""take over"" the country's institutions on Tuesday, saying he has canceled all meetings with the Iranian regime until its crackdown on unrest ends.

Trump made the announcement on social media, vowing that those responsible for killing anti-regime demonstrators will ""pay a big price."" Iran had previously claimed it was in contact with U.S. officials amid the protests.

""Iranian Patriots, KEEP PROTESTING - TAKE OVER YOUR INSTITUTIONS!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""Save the names of the killers and abusers. They will pay a big price.""

""I have canceled all meetings with Iranian Officials until the senseless killing of protesters STOPS. HELP IS ON ITS WAY,"" he added.

Since the unrest broke out, Iranian authorities have killed at least 646 protesters, with thousands more deaths expected to be confirmed. Reuters reported the death toll at 2,000, citing an unnamed Iranian official.

The White House confirmed on Monday that Trump was weighing whether to bomb Iran in reaction to the crackdown.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that diplomacy remains Trump's first option, but that the president ""has shown he's unafraid to use military options if and when he deems necessary.""

""He certainly doesn't want to see people being killed in the streets of Tehran. And unfortunately that's something we are seeing right now,"" she added.

Iranian authorities have used deadly force against anti-regime protesters and have cut off public internet access in an effort to stop images and video from spreading across the globe.

The protests represent the highest level of unrest Iran has seen since nationwide protests against the death of Mahsa Amini at the hands of morality police in 2022.

""I assume that we are now witnessing the final days and weeks of this regime,"" he told reporters while in India on Tuesday.

""When a regime can only maintain power through violence, then it is effectively at its end. The population is now rising up against this regime,"" he added.

Fox News host Greg Gutfeld and the panel analyze the updated U.S. dietary guidelines through 2030 and the new food pyramid on ‘Gutfeld!'

Red meat has reentered the national health conversation thanks to sweeping changes to federal diet guidelines released by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

President Donald Trump's administration last week unveiled a new upside-down food pyramid as part of the 2025–2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. It emphasizes whole, nutrient-dense foods and places protein, dairy, healthy fats, vegetables and fruit at the top — with refined carbohydrates and grains deemphasized.

The updated guidelines recommend prioritizing ""high-quality, nutrient-dense protein foods as part of a healthy dietary pattern.""

RED MEAT CAN HELP YOUR MOOD IF PART OF A HEALTHY, BALANCED DIET, STUDY SUGGESTS

""Consume a variety of protein foods from animal sources, including eggs, poultry, seafood and red meat,"" the guidance states, while also encouraging ""a variety of plant-sourced protein foods, including beans, peas, lentils, legumes, nuts, seeds and soy.""

HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the new guidelines ""recognize that whole, nutrient-dense food is the most effective path to better health and lower healthcare costs.""

""Protein and healthy fats are essential and were wrongly discouraged in prior dietary guidelines. We are ending the war on saturated fats,"" Kennedy said.

The visual grouping of red meat alongside fruits and vegetables has drawn attention from some Americans, though health experts caution that the new framework still emphasizes moderation and balance.

EATING CHICKEN LINKED TO HIGHER MORTALITY RATES, OBSERVATIONAL STUDY SUGGESTS

Dr. Craig Basman, a cardiologist at Hackensack Meridian Health in New Jersey, shared ideas for thoughtfully incorporating red meat into a heart-healthy diet.

Not all red meat is created equal, Basman told Fox News Digital — and people concerned about heart health should prioritize leaner options.

Lean cuts of beef and pork are recommended for those incorporating red meat into their regular meals. (iStock)

Red meat includes beef, pork, lamb, veal, goat and mutton — not poultry or fish.

""For beef, look for 'loin' or 'round' in the name,"" Basman said. ""For pork, tenderloin and loin chops are leaner choices.""

If you don't have the leanest cut, Basman suggested trimming the fat.

Cooking methods also matter, Basman said.

""Slower cooking methods at lower temperatures are preferred,"" he said.

""Baking, broiling, roasting and steaming are excellent choices, as they allow fat to drip away.""

Cooking meat at very high temperatures can pose health risks, according to Basman.

Grilling and frying at high temperatures, Basman said, ""can create harmful compounds, including advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and heterocyclic amines (HCAs).""

Experts warn that high-temperature grilling and frying can create compounds linked to inflammation and disease. (iStock)

These compounds have been linked in studies to inflammation and increased risks of heart disease and certain cancers.

""If you grill, avoid charring the meat and cook at a lower temperature,"" Basman said.

Marinating meat can offer health benefits in addition to flavor, Basman said.

Acidic marinades made with ingredients like lemon juice or vinegar may help ""reduce the formation of harmful compounds"" during cooking, Basman said.

Despite the inclusion of red meat in the new dietary guidance, processed meats remain a concern among cardiologists, Basman said.

Americans should avoid or strictly limit their intake of bacon, sausage, hot dogs and deli meats, he said.

""These products are typically very high in sodium and preservatives, both of which are linked to high blood pressure and 'bad' cholesterol, which may increase the risk of heart disease,"" Basman said.

Doctors say processed meats should be avoided or strictly limited because of links to high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol. (iStock)

While the new food pyramid allows for red meat as part of a healthy dietary pattern, it should ""be eaten less often and in smaller portions,"" Basman said.

""For heart health, it's best to mix red meat with healthier protein choices like poultry, fish and plant-based proteins such as beans, lentils and nuts,"" he said.

Balancing protein sources can help ""lower saturated fat intake and support healthy cholesterol levels,"" Basman added — while still allowing flexibility and enjoyment in everyday eating.

House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., discusses the alleged fraud in Minnesota and how the House is working to crack down on fraud on ‘The Big Weekend Show.' 

FIRST ON FOX: The Trump administration is ending temporary protection status (TPS) for Somalia, affecting several thousand Somalis currently living in the U.S. and several hundred currently living in Minnesota under the protection.

Somali migrants with TPS will be required to leave the country by March 17. 

""Temporary means temporary,"" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""Country conditions in Somalia have improved to the point that it no longer meets the law's requirement for Temporary Protected Status."" 

""Further, allowing Somali nationals to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to our national interests,"" Noem added. ""We are putting Americans first.""

ILHAN OMAR KICKED OUT OF ICE FACILITY AFTER DHS REQUIRES WEEK'S ADVANCE NOTICE

Sources at USCIS told Fox News Digital that there are 2,471 Somali nationals currently in the U.S. under TPS, with 1,383 in the country with pending TPS applications. 

The move comes as DHS continues ICE operations in Minneapolis, Minnesota, after a widespread roughly $9 billion fraud scheme involving members of the Somali community plagued the state. 

Fox News Digital learned that an estimated 600 Somali nationals who are protected by TPS live in Minnesota.

Somalia was granted temporary protection status in 1991 as a result of an ongoing civil war in the African nation. President Joe Biden most recently extended the protection in September 2024.

The decision to end TPS for Somalia also comes a day after the Twin Cities, Minneapolis and St. Paul, sued the Trump administration after a historic federal immigration enforcement operation was launched by ICE and DHS.

""We allege that the obvious targeting of Minnesota for our diversity, for our democracy and our differences of opinion with the federal government is a violation of the Constitution and of federal law,"" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison told reporters at a press conference on Monday.

""DHS agents have sown chaos and terror across the metropolitan area,"" Ellison added.

Last week, during ICE operations in south Minneapolis, a woman was fatally shot by an immigration officer as she drove her vehicle toward agents, prompting agitators to riot across the city in the following days.

Noem labeled the woman who was killed, Renee Nicole Good, as a ""domestic terrorist,"" asserting that Good ""weaponized her vehicle"" after blocking ICE agents on the road.

Footage from the encounter shows an agent approaching Good's vehicle and ordering her to step out. According to Noem, Good then attempted to run over an officer, prompting the agent to fire multiple shots into the car, killing the 37-year-old.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey told ICE to ""get the f--- out of Minneapolis,"" during a news conference after Good's death, and Gov. Tim Walz criticized DHS, posting to X that he saw the video, and referred to Noem's explanation of the incident as a part of a ""propaganda machine.""

Agitators blocked off the street where Good was killed using homemade barricades, creating a no-go zone the day after her death. Streets were blocked off with rioters directing traffic and little to no local police presence was seen in the area.

Despite the unrest, DHS operations continued in Minneapolis, prompting clashes between agitators and immigration agents.

DHS senior advisor Ron Vitiello joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the Minneapolis mayor's stance on anti-ICE protests and more as demonstrations spread nationwide.

Police groups, MAGA supporters and the Department of Homeland Security mocked left-wing Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner on social media for his warning to the National Guard and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement amid President Donald Trump's immigration and fraud crackdowns. 

""To ICE and the National Guard: if you commit crimes in Philadelphia, we will charge you and hold you accountable to the fullest extent of the law,"" Krasner posted to X Saturday, accompanied by a black and white photo of himself wearing sunglasses and the caption ""FAFO.""

""FAFO"" is internet slang meaning ""f--- around and find out."" It increasingly has entered the MAGA political lexicon, been embraced by Trump, and been used in administration-linked messaging and by prominent Republican allies as a blunt warning to political opponents and foreign adversaries. 

Krasner has served as Philadelphia's district attorney since 2018, frequently coming under fire from conservatives for reduced reliance on cash bail, shifts in charging for some low-level crimes, and an aggressive posture on police accountability. Republicans have repeatedly pointed to his office's bail and prosecution policies as drivers of public-safety concerns, staging high-profile hearings and pushing an impeachment effort that ultimately collapsed in court.

Conservatives, police groups and leaders and administration social media accounts lambasted Krasner over the message. Krasner's post came amid a heightened federal law enforcement presence in Minnesota, as a sweeping Minneapolis fraud investigation unfolded and a woman was fatally shot during the increased deployment.

""This embarrassment of a DA regularly gives the velvet glove treatment to murders, robbers, and rapists…what a joke,"" Fraternal Order of Police National Vice President Joe Gamaldi posted to X, slamming Krasner. 

""Unlike criminals in Philadelphia who get their charges dropped by the DA,"" the National Police Association responded. 

The Department of Homeland Security responded with at least two memes brushing off Krasner's comment, including a gif of a person dressed up as a founding father with the caption, ""Oh no! Anyways."" 

""True Clownsmanship,"" a lawyer on X quipped.

""Note that Larry Krasner has never said FAFO to the actual criminals he's supposed to put behind bars, and thus his city is garbage. But good posturing you pathetic waste of space,"" Republican communicator Matt Whitlock wrote. 

""This is so cringe, even for a Soros DA,"" another commented. 

Left-wing billionaire George Soros was one of Krasner's donors amid his election effort, Fox Digital previously reported. 

""It would be news if Krassner prosecuted an actual criminal, let alone ICE,"" RealClearInvestigations senior writer Mark Hemingway posted. 

""LMAO, they try so hard to use social media the way this administration does, and it fails every time,"" another posted, referring to Democrats attempting to lean into MAGA's often searing use of social media.

""This idiot has never read the Supremacy Clause of the US Constitution,"" former New Jersey Senate candidate Mike Crispi posted. ""Federal law trumps local law when in direct conflict of one another. This post is pure provocative trash."" 

Krasner's social media message joins a chorus of Democrats nationwide criticizing ICE and federal immigration law enforcement officials following the fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minnesota earlier in January. Good was shot on a residential street while operating her car. 

DHS said Good used her car as weapon against the agents before the shooting, calling her actions an ""act of domestic terrorism.""

Philadelphia Sheriff Rochelle Bilal also slammed ICE earlier in January as made up, ""fake, wannabe law enforcement,"" claiming ICE violated both ""legal law"" and ""moral law"" following the shooting. 

Democrats have rallied against the federal law enforcement officer's actions, with some left-wing lawmakers such as New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez calling the incident ""murder,"" while other Democrats have underscored a push for more accountability of federal officers.

Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz authorized the National Guard to be ""staged and ready to support local and state law enforcement in protecting critical infrastructure and maintaining public safety following a shooting involving federal immigration enforcement agents in south Minneapolis."" Trump has mobilized, or attempted to mobilize, the National Guard to other cities in 2025 as part of his mission to crack down on crime, including when he federalized the Washington, D.C., police force in August 2025.

Justices hear arguments to examine state actions to protect women's sports in Idaho (Little v. Hecox) and West Virginia (West Virginia v. B.P.J.).

The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments Tuesday in two cases that could determine whether states can ban transgender athletes who identify as women from competing on girls' and women's sports teams, a legal fight that could have far-reaching implications on transgender policies across the country.

The arguments in the two cases, Little v. Hecox and West Virginia v. B.P.J., will examine state bans on transgender athletes participating in school sports under Title IX and the Constitution's equal protection clause.

At issue is whether laws in Idaho and West Virginia that prohibit transgender athletes who identify as women from playing on teams that match their gender identity discriminate based on sex.

JUSTICE URGES ‘STAND UP FOR OUR GIRLS' AS SUPREME COURT WEIGHS FATE OF HIS 'SAVE WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT'

Lower courts struck down the bans as unconstitutional violations of Title IX and equal protection, and the two Republican-led states appealed to the Supreme Court.

""It's about Title IX. It‘s about equal protection, and it's also about common sense, but mostly it's about protecting women in both academia and on the athletic field,"" West Virginia Attorney General JB McCuskey told Fox News Digital in a phone interview.

The justices will hear each of the cases Tuesday morning beginning at 10 a.m.

The high court has set aside an hour for each case, but arguments are expected to run longer as the states, the plaintiffs represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Trump administration each present their positions and answer the justices' questions.

(Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post via Getty Images)

In Little v. Hecox, Lindsay Hecox, a biological man who sought to compete on the women's track and cross-country teams at Boise State University, contended that Idaho's law, the Fairness in Women's Sports Act, violated the equal protection clause by excluding transgender women.

West Virginia v. B.P.J. centers on a 15-year-old transgender athlete who identifies as a girl and who argued the state's ban violated both the Constitution and Title IX's ban on sex discrimination in federally funded education programs.

Lawyers for the states defending the bans maintain that separating sports based on biological sex preserves fairness and safety for female athletes and is consistent with Title IX's definition of sex.

(REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst)

The Trump administration is supporting the states in the cases, asserting that Title IX and equal protection permit sex-based distinctions in athletics and criticizing lower courts for undermining states' authority. The solicitor general's office will be able to present the administration's case on behalf of the U.S. during Tuesday's arguments.

The debate has garnered enormous attention, as evidenced by the dozens of amicus briefs submitted to the court by athletes, coaches, lawmakers and state attorneys general on both sides of the debate. The Washington Post editorial board came out against the trans athletes in an op-ed this past weekend, saying the Supreme Court has the chance to correct ""one of the worst excesses of America's cultural revolution.""

WASHINGTON POST URGES SUPREME COURT TO 'SAVE WOMEN'S SPORTS' AHEAD OF MAJOR TRANS ATHLETE CASE

Observers say a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs could limit state power to adopt similar bans and broaden interpretations of federal nondiscrimination protections, while a decision for the states could uphold the bans and influence other transgender policy disputes, such as bathroom policies and sex designation on documents, such as passports and driver's licenses.

""Ideally, in my mind, what would happen is that all 50 states in the federal government pass a similar law to the Save Women's Sports Act and women's playing fields will be exclusive to biological women,"" McCuskey said, predicting the court would rule in favor of the states 9-0.

The transgender athletes are represented by the ACLU, which argues that the challenged laws unlawfully discriminate against people who identify as women by excluding them from women's and girls' sports.

""Categorically excluding kids from school sports just because they are transgender will only make our schools less safe and more hurtful places for all youth,"" ACLU attorneys said in a statement.

Transgender rights advocates say the red-leaning states and the Trump administration have singled out transgender students and spent exorbitant resources to target what they say are a negligible number of transgender athletes. McCuskey said that argument did not account for women and girls.

""You make the argument that B.P.J. is being discriminated against, but that belies the argument that all 300 of the other girls that B.P.J. beat in an athletic competition aren't victims,"" he said.

The Supreme Court is expected to decide the cases by early summer.

Attorney Jace Yarbrough discusses legal ramifications of public figures calling an I.C.E. agent a 'murderer' in the Minnesota shooting on 'The Will Cain Show.'

The Department of Homeland Security detained a New York City Council employee during an immigration appointment on Monday, leading to outrage from Mayor Zohran Mamdani.

DHS says the migrant, 53-year-old Rafael Andres Rubio Bohorquez, overstayed on a 2017 tourist visa. They also say he was arrested in an assault case. Mamdani and other city leaders demanded the man's release on Monday.

""I am outraged to hear a New York City Council employee was detained in Nassau County by federal immigration officials at a routine immigration appointment,"" Mamdani wrote in a statement on X. ""This is an assault on our democracy, on our city, and our values. I am calling for his immediate release and will continue to monitor the situation.""

DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin dismissed complaints, however, saying the department was fully justified in taking Bohorquez into custody.

""He had no legal right to be in the United States,"" McLaughlin said. ""Under Secretary Noem, criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the United States. If you come to our country illegally and break our law, we will find you, and we will arrest you.""

NYC Council Speaker Julie Menin held a press conference demanding the employee's release on Monday. She claimed that the employee had been cleared to remain in the U.S. until October 2026.

""DHS confirmed that this employee had gone in for a routine court appointment and was nevertheless detained. They provided no other basis for his detainment,"" Menin said during a press briefing on Monday. ""On the contrary, he was a city council employee who is doing everything right. He went to the court when he was asked.""

Menin said the employee works as a data analyst and has held the job for roughly one year. DHS, however, maintains the man is not authorized to work in the U.S.

New York Attorney General Letitia James threw her weight behind calls for the employee's release later Monday.

Readers respond to our October 2025 cover story and more.

Jill Lepore's stellar cover story rightly described the Constitution's amendment provision as a “sleeping giant.” The process is indeed in sound slumber today, but history suggests that it will wake up. Amendments, history shows, come in cycles. The political factors that trigger those cycles always differ. But what precedes each wave of amendments is consistent: worsening polarization that escalates to violence, butting up against conventional wisdom that insists that amendments are not a viable solution. We are sadly at such a point, much as we were a decade or more before the first amendments of the Progressive era were ratified in 1913. Just prior, at the turn of the century, then-scholar Woodrow Wilson, the editorial board of The Washington Post, and the award-winning historian Herman Ames all claimed that the Constitution was unamendable. They were wrong.

We should hope that the violence that finally stirs the giant will be less destructive than in cycles past. But I think we haven't yet hit the low point in our current spiral. We're getting closer: The civic pressures causing our descent are foundational, which means we must confront the Constitution as we reach the bottom. Our return ascent will include repair, correction, and hopefully some amendments.

Rick LaRue Silver Spring, Md.

I appreciated Jill Lepore's call for overdue amendments in “How Originalism Killed the Constitution.” It is clear from our imperial presidency, gridlocked Congress, and captured courts that America suffers from a deep constitutional rot. Potential amendments could include establishing equal rights for women, abolishing the Electoral College, overturning Citizens United, and banning gerrymandering. The United States could even attempt more dramatic revisions, such as establishing an elected attorney general, like many states, or imposing a wealth cap, as theorized by Thomas Paine and Plato.

The article describes the Constitution's amendment provision as a “sleeping giant.” But how do we wake it? Voters in Missouri, a state referenced in the article for its long history of constitutional amendment, have utilized referenda and initiatives to drive constitutional change for more than a century. Most recently, in November 2024, Missouri voters chose to enshrine women's fundamental right to reproductive freedom in our state constitution. About 25 states have one or both of these processes, which have been found to promote accountable and responsive government.

In this context, one idea suggested in the 1980s by then-Representative Dick Gephardt of Missouri should be revisited: the national advisory referendum. A proposed amendment, placed on a midterm or presidential ballot by an act of Congress, would not be binding, but the result would gauge whether the amendment has sufficient nationwide support to meet the Constitution's Article V state-ratification requirement.

Unlike most other modern democracies, America has never held a national vote on a question other than who should occupy the presidency and vice presidency. Perhaps this is one of the sources of the chief executive's extraordinary power. But what if the solution to our nation's democratic dysfunction is more democracy, not less?

Nahuel Sebastian Fefer St. Louis, Mo.

As I read Jill Lepore's article, I kept looking for a mention of the one word consistently missed in the Constitution. For years, I have been hoping that the “originalists” would stop and read the first sentence—“We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union …”—and realize they have been overlooking the word more.

The Framers did not believe that America was perfect and that its Constitution ought to be cast in stone, only that America was more perfect than what had come before. They could easily have written “in Order to form a perfect Union,” but they didn't. Instead, they understood that what they wrote was never going to be perfect and would need to adapt to endure. Thus, Article V.

Only by ignoring that word can originalists conclude that the Constitution is, as Justice Antonin Scalia put it, “dead, dead, dead.”

Cyndy Carrington Miller Easton, Md.

This summer, while visiting Washington, D.C., with my son, we went inside the Jefferson Memorial and read the inscriptions on the walls out loud. One quote struck me deeply: “I am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions, but laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths discovered and manners and opinions change, with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times. We might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors.”

This excerpt from a letter by Thomas Jefferson resonated with me immediately. Jefferson—the original originalist—would have been appalled at some of our recent Supreme Court decisions.

Jill Lepore states that the more than 400 federal judges appointed by Ronald Reagan were “screened for their views on abortion.” I was Reagan's last appointment to the United States Court of Appeals, but I was not asked for mine. I was warned that I would be, but the closest his staff got was the following exchange:

“Judge Nygaard, do you have a judicial philosophy?”

“Yes.”

“Would you tell us what it is?”

“I will. In criminal matters, I am basically Cartesian. And in civil and other matters, I am definitely Aristotelian.”

They asked no follow-up questions. I doubt they knew what I was talking about. In full disclosure, I am not sure even I knew!

Richard L. Nygaard United States Circuit Judge North East, Pa.

In high school I had a wonderfully pudgy and eccentric tenth-grade history teacher. He taught in a second-story room with a wide plate-glass window that looked out at a mountain in the distance, whose silhouette resembled a sleeping giant. In the middle of an especially boring lesson—the accidental presidency of John Tyler, say—he'd lumber across the room and haul himself up onto the radiator beneath the window and lie down on it, exactly lining up his belly with the mountain's summit, his head and feet with its smaller peaks: he, the giant. He'd sigh, settling in, and then he'd appear to nod off. We'd wait, a little nervously. And then suddenly and in a whirl of motion you could not imagine as within the capacity of so large and old and ungainly a man, he'd roll off the radiator, leap to his feet, and cry, “The giant wakes!” And it would be very thrilling, and we'd all snap to attention, and he'd move on and—somehow, somehow—he'd make the fall of the Whig Party gripping. In short, I heartily agree with these readers, and I hereby offer my assurance that the whole point of my sleeping-giant analogy with reference to Article V of the Constitution, aside from being a nod to a beloved teacher, is that somehow, somehow, and I suspect one day soon, “the giant will wake” !

In this month's cover story, “Is This What Patriotism Looks Like?”, Jamie Thompson tells the stories of Thomas Webster, a retired New York City policeman who attacked the Capitol on January 6, 2021, and Noah Rathbun, a police officer whom Webster assaulted. (Webster has since been pardoned by Donald Trump.) Thompson also profiles Daniel Hodges, a police officer who was pinned against a doorway and beaten while attempting to prevent the mob from breaching the building. For our cover image, we selected a photograph of a group of officers attempting to hold back a crowd of rioters outside the Capitol.

“Just How Real Should Colonial Williamsburg Be?” (November) originally stated that Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry once lived in the Governor's Palace in Colonial Williamsburg. In fact, the residence at Colonial Williamsburg is a reconstruction of the original building. “The New German War Machine” (January) originally stated that the Bendlerblock once served as the headquarters of the Wehrmacht. In fact, it served as the headquarters of several divisions of the German military.

The Court must deal with the chaos it created around guns.

Judges rarely complain openly about the Supreme Court, for the same reason that most people do not publicly chastise their bosses. Attacking your boss is a good way to ensure that your own work will be discounted — or worse.

So it's remarkable just how many judges have published opinions criticizing the Supreme Court's decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Ass'n v. Bruen (2022), a decision by all six of the Court's Republicans that instructs lower court judges on how they should handle Second Amendment cases.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

Or, at least, Bruen purports to provide lower courts with this kind of guidance. As one federal judge complained in a 2023 opinion, the “unique test” the Republican justices came up with in Bruen “does not provide lower courts with clear guidance.” Courts, a different federal appellate judge wrote, “are struggling at every stage of the Bruen inquiry.”

Indeed, in her concurring opinion in United States v. Rahimi (2024), the Supreme Court's only attempt to interpret Bruen since that decision was handed down, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson quoted a dozen different judicial opinions complaining that Bruen simply does not work. One Trump appointee protested Bruen's “inconsistent and amorphous standard” and warned that it “created mountains of work for district courts that must now deal with Bruen-related arguments in nearly every criminal case in which a firearm is found”

Briefly, Bruen held that for nearly any gun law to survive a constitutional challenge, “the government must demonstrate that the regulation is consistent with this Nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation.” To meet this burden, government lawyers must show that the modern-day gun law they are defending is sufficiently similar to “analogous regulations” that existed when the Constitution was framed.

And just how “analogous” must these long-forgotten laws be? As the dozen judges quoted by Justice Jackson show, no one really knows. In 2020, the federal government alone charged more than 14,000 defendants with firearm-related crimes. Thanks to Bruen, every single one of those cases can descend into a Mad Hatter–like inquiry into how a raven resembles a writing desk.

Which brings us to Wolford v. Lopez, the first of two Second Amendment cases that the Court plans to hear in its current term. Wolford, which the justices will hear on January 20, is poised to be the Court's second-ever decision explaining what the hell Bruen means.

A humbler Court would recognize that Bruen is a failure and overrule that decision — prior to Bruen, every federal appeals court used a two-step framework (which I explain in more detail here) to analyze Second Amendment cases. The Court could simply restore this framework, which worked perfectly well and did not create the same confusion among judges.

But that outcome is unlikely. Historical analysis is currently fashionable among Republican judges, many of whom identify with originalism — an approach to constitutional cases which fixates on how words were understood more than 200 years ago. In Bruen, the Republican justices attempted to build a framework for interpreting an entire constitutional amendment that is grounded in originalism. Overruling Bruen means admitting that this originalist project failed.

Still, the Wolford case should give pro-gun Republicans pause for an unexpected reason: The biggest advantage the lawyers defending a Hawaii gun law have on their side is the Court's cockamamie reasoning in Bruen.

The plaintiffs in Wolford, three gun owners and a pro-gun advocacy group, challenge a fairly clever Hawaii law that appears to be designed to undermine the result the Court reached in Bruen.

Bruen struck down a 108-year-old New York state law that required anyone who wanted to carry a handgun in public to demonstrate “proper cause” before they could obtain a license allowing them to do so. The Hawaii law at issue in Wolford imposes similarly strict restrictions on public carry through a different means. It makes it a crime to bring a gun onto private property “unless the person has been given express authorization to carry a firearm on the property by the owner, lessee, operator, or manager of the property.”

Thus, the practical effect of Hawaii's law is to remove guns from most shops, hotels, restaurants, and other places of business. Most business owners aren't going to put out a sign announcing that guns are allowed inside. And few gun owners are likely to enter such a business without their firearm, track down the manager, obtain permission to bring their gun inside, and then go retrieve the weapon.

If Bruen were a coherent decision that applied normal legal reasoning, in other words, the Wolford plaintiffs would have a fairly clear cut case. Typically, the Supreme Court does not allow states to bypass its decisions by concocting Rube Goldberg–like devices to achieve ends that the Court has already determined are unconstitutional.

And yet, somewhat ironically, the best thing that Hawaii's lawyers have going for them in Wolford is the nonsensical historical framework laid out in Bruen.

In their brief to the justices, Hawaii's lawyers identify various colonial and early American state laws that closely resemble the Hawaii statute forbidding gun owners to bring their weapons onto private land without the landowner's permission.

This list includes a 1771 New Jersey law barring someone from bringing “any gun on any Lands not his own, and for which the owner pays taxes, or is in his lawful possession, unless he has license or permission in writing from the owner.” It also includes a similar 1721 Pennsylvania law preventing someone from hunting or bringing a gun onto another person's land without “Lisence [sic] or Permission from the Owner of any such Lands or Plantation,” and a 1763 New York law making it unlawful to carry a gun on “inclosed Land” without “License in Writing first had and obtained for that Purpose from such Owner, Proprietor, or Possessor.”

It appears, in other words, that Americans around the time of the nation's founding and the ratification of the Second Amendment were quite comfortable with laws banning gun possession on private land without the land owner's permission. That should be enough to uphold Hawaii's law under Bruen's “historical tradition of firearm regulation” standard. But it's not that simple.

Wolford should be an awkward case for the Court's Republicans, because the largely pro-gun framework they announced in Bruen doesn't actually point to a pro-gun result in this case. Realistically, however, the Bruen framework is sufficiently malleable that these justices can reach whatever result they want in Wolford.

Consider, for example, Rahimi, the only post-Bruen case the Court has handed down interpreting that decision.

Rahimi involved a cartoonishly violent individual who, when the Court decided this case, was accused of committing six different shooting crimes — that is, crimes where he actually discharged a firearm. In one of these incidents, he allegedly fired his gun at a bystander who witnessed him beating the mother of his child. A majority of the justices voted to uphold his conviction under a federal law that prohibits many people who are subject to domestic violence restraining orders from possessing a gun.

Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote the majority opinion in Rahimi, primarily reasoned that this federal law was sufficiently similar to Founding Era laws that required individuals who were believed to be likely to engage in violence to post a bond, which they would forfeit if they “broke the peace.”

In dissent, meanwhile, Justice Clarence Thomas argued that these bond-posting laws were not sufficiently similar to the modern-day ban on carrying a gun while under a restraining order, because the Founding Era laws “imposed a far less onerous burden.” They neither disarmed individuals nor incarcerated them if they were later found with a gun.

Because Bruen's “analogous regulations” test is so vague, both Roberts and Thomas made plausible arguments: Bruen didn't fully explain just how similar a modern law must be to a colonial or early American law in order to survive judicial review. Indeed, if anything, Thomas had the stronger argument that the law in Rahimi should have been struck down under Bruen.

Bruen said that “when a challenged regulation addresses a general societal problem that has persisted since the 18th century, the lack of a distinctly similar historical regulation addressing that problem is relevant evidence that the challenged regulation is inconsistent with the Second Amendment.” Violence between romantic partners is a societal problem that existed well before the 18th century. But every state permitted married partners to beat their spouses until 1871, when the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that a husband and wife “may be indicted for assault and battery upon each other.”

Bruen, in other words, does not actually tell judges how to decide gun cases — as so many lower court judges have complained. It merely insists that they must tell a story about whether a modern law is similar to a very old law.

Indeed, there is empirical evidence that Bruen gives judges broad leeway to decide gun cases however they choose. A 2023 paper by scholars Eric Ruben, Rosanna Smart, and Ali Rowhani-Rahbar indicates that “Bruen has not meaningfully constrained judges” and has instead freed them to decide gun cases according to their “judicial ideology.” The paper finds that “judges appointed by Republican presidents are 1.8 times as likely” to rule that a gun law violates Bruen “as judges appointed by Democratic presidents.”

Bruen, in other words, is not law. Rather than constraining how judges decide cases, it merely requires them to cite historical sources in an opinion that reaches whatever conclusion aligns with their politics. On a 6-3 Republican Supreme Court, that means that the Hawaii law at issue in Wolford is likely to fall.

We're finally making progress toward a universal flu vaccine.

Let's start with the bad news.

There's a decent chance, perhaps as high as 11 percent if you're unvaccinated, that some time over the course of this winter, you'll be overcome with chills, followed by extreme fatigue, body aches and cough, and culminating in a sudden spike in fever. Congratulations: you have the flu.

A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world.

Every winter in the US has its share of flu cases, but this season is shaping up to be particularly bad. Early this week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put the flu season in the “moderately severe” category, with an estimated 11 million illnesses, 120,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths so far. Here in New York, where I live, the city kicked off 2026 by setting records for flu-related hospitalizations.

While what we're experiencing is not a “super flu,” it is a particularly bad one, thanks in part to the emergence of a subgroup of the well-established H3N2 flu virus called subclade K. It carries a bunch of mutations that seem to have rendered the current flu vaccine somewhat less effective. (Though far from completely ineffective — more on that below.) Nor does it help that only around 44 percent of US adults have taken the flu shot so far, well below vaccination rates before the Covid pandemic. The decline has been particularly sharp for children, who are more vulnerable to the flu, which has resulted in higher than normal pediatric hospitalizations.

As bad as this season is shaping up to be, chances are most of us will suffer through it and then forget until the next year comes around. After all, it's just the flu, right? But even normal influenza is far more than just a seasonal nuisance. The World Health Organization estimates that there are around 1 billion flu infections in a given year, which can lead to as many as 5 million severe cases and up to 650,000 flu-related respiratory deaths per year, mostly among the very young and the very old.

The burden of flu goes beyond those numbers: CDC research indicates that flu infections can raise the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Plus all those sick days add up to as much as 111 million lost work days in the US alone, while childhood infections lead to more school absences and a knock-on effect for parents forced to stay home.

Oh, and chances are decent that the (inevitable) next global pandemic will come from a mutant flu virus, just like past pandemics in 2009, 1968, 1957, and the granddaddy of them all, 1918, which killed at least 50 million people around the world.

So that's the bad news. The good news? There are ways to protect yourself right now — and even more promising, glimmers on the scientific frontier of a world without flu.

The simplest way to keep safe is, of course, to get your flu shot. Like right now — even though the flu season is well underway, it's worth getting your shot if you haven't yet. Early data from the UK found protection rates against hospital admission of 70 to 75 percent for children and 30 to 35 percent in adults. That's normal: The standard flu vaccine isn't great at preventing cases, but it is very effective in reducing the severity of illness. Throw in the fact that you can now easily get an at-home flu test and secure the antiviral Tamiflu early in an illness, and you do have the power to ensure your case is milder.

But it is true flu shots are not our most effective class of vaccine. That largely has to do with the nature of the flu, and how the shots are made.

Influenza is what you might call a “promiscuous” virus. Strains are constantly evolving, and can easily swap genetic material through a process called reassortment to create new, potentially more dangerous viruses. Because of that, international health officials have to create a new vaccine strain every year, hoping that it will match the strain actually circulating months later when vaccines are available for distribution.

If the dominant strain changes during those months, the vaccine will be less effective. And any vaccine that has to be taken over and over again on an annual basis is going to be a harder sell to the public, even before taking into account rising anti-vax sentiment.

There's already progress being made to reduce the time between when a vaccine strain is selected and when it can be produced, chiefly by using rapid mRNA platforms rather than growing vaccines in eggs, as has been done for decades. But even better: What if it were possible to create a flu vaccine that was effective against a wide variety of different flu strains?

A “universal” flu vaccine is one that would be at least 75 percent effective against influenza A viruses and provide durable protection for at least a year (though ideally longer). In other words, it would be a vaccine that would act more like the almost perfectly protective measles vaccine and less like, well, a flu shot.

Such “universal” flu coverage would not be one single breakthrough, but a portfolio of strategies for outsmarting a virus that mutates faster than our annual vaccine calendar. The first bucket is universal (or universal-ish) vaccines: instead of training antibodies mainly against flu's fast-changing hemagglutinin (HA) “head,” researchers are trying to steer immunity toward viral targets that mutate less.

One major approach focuses on the HA stem or stalk, a region of the virus that changes more slowly; early human trials of stem-focused designs suggest these vaccines can be safe and elicit broadly reactive immune responses. Another vaccine strategy uses mosaic/nanoparticle displays that present HA antigens from multiple strains at once, aiming to teach the immune system to recognize flu's common features rather than this year's exact variant; the government's FluMos program is an example now in early clinical testing.

A third line leans on broader immune mechanisms: targeting neuraminidase (NA) (the N in HN flu viruses), or boosting T-cell responses to internal proteins that rarely change, which may not always prevent infection but could make illness far less severe when the virus drifts.

There's also the “universal without a vaccine” lane: prevention and treatment that don't depend on your immune system's memory. Cidara, a San Diego-based biotech company, has developed a long-acting preventive designed to provide season-long protection by chemically linking multiple copies of a neuraminidase inhibitor to a long-lasting antibody. Preclinical work has shown broad resistance to influenza A and B, and the company's approach is promising enough that it is now in the process of being acquired by pharma giant Merck.

Even more sci-fi: using gene editing to create all-purpose flu treatments. Scientists in Australia are working on using the gene editing tool Crispr to develop an antiviral nasal spray that could shut down a wide variety of flu viruses.

Historically, the US hasn't allocated nearly enough money to universal flu prevention research, though in May the Trump administration surprised scientists with plans to spend $500 million on an approach that relies on older vaccine technology. Except in those rare years when a flu pandemic boils over, we tend to treat flu as something we just have to suffer through.

But hundreds of thousands of people globally each year won't survive their bouts with the flu, and millions more will suffer because of the viruses. We've managed to all but knock out past killers like smallpox, the measles, and the mumps (Well, provided we agree to take our vaccines.) There's reason to believe that influenza can be next.

Experts explain whether there's such a thing as too much fitness.

If 2025 proved one thing, it's that Americans' interest in maximal fitness is higher than ever.

Participation in running races broke records. The New York City Marathon in November had almost 60,000 finishers, breaking the previous year's record by several thousand, and ultrarunning events, which involve running longer-than-marathon distances, recorded historic participation levels. Meanwhile, extreme workout regimens are going viral. That includes 75 Hard, which dictates 75 consecutive days of drinking a gallon of water, forgoing alcohol, following a new diet of your choice, reading 10 pages of nonfiction, and twice-daily 45-minute workouts (one of which must be outside).

While there is also undoubtedly a social component to this exercise maximalism, the aim of all this exertion is to be “fitter,” a word we tend to use as a synonym for “healthier.” We all know that getting regular exercise is critically important for our physical and mental well-being, but what's less clear is just how fit we need to be for health. Should we all be striving to be ultra-fast marathoners, or is there a middle ground in fitness, where we can be just as healthy without those lofty exercise goals? After all, far from all of us will become elite athletes. When it comes to fitness, is more really more?

The answer is a little complicated. Improving your fitness through exercise affects health in a number of ways. It reduces the risk of diseases like heart failure or dementia, but it also makes your body more functional, so you're able to open heavy doors or carry your groceries. Researchers have found that the biggest improvement to health — for longevity but also your quality of life — appears when a non-exerciser begins to add some light exercise in their routine. Going from only light exercise to more intense or prolonged exercise does have additional health benefits, but there do seem to be diminishing health returns on the investments of your time and efforts. Complicating the issue is the fact that fitness can't be boiled down to just one thing, or one measure.

Experts typically divide fitness into two categories you are probably familiar with: muscular strength and cardiorespiratory (or cardiovascular) fitness.

Muscular strength is simply how strong you are, and can be developed by resistance training like lifting weights. The primary connection between muscular strength and health is in the fact that maintaining good muscle mass prevents frailty and allows people to do the activities they want to do without injury.

The benefits that resistance training in young adulthood might provide for long-term health and longevity are a little unclear. But what is clear is that maintaining muscular strength is incredibly important for the health of older adults, since muscles weaken as you age. There's also some mixed scientific evidence suggesting that resistance training can possibly improve brain health, help with managing Type 2 diabetes, and reduce cancer mortality.

Cardiorespiratory fitness is how well your body can utilize oxygen while exercising, and is improved via aerobic exercises, including running or biking. There's much more robust research connecting cardiorespiratory fitness to health than with strength fitness, with evidence showing that it reduces the risk of heart disease and death by cancer, and it also improves longevity in general.

This type of fitness is typically measured using a metric called VO2 max, which describes how many milliliters of oxygen the body consumes per kilogram of body weight per minute of exercise. To complete any function, our bodies require a constant supply of oxygen, which is supplied as our lungs breathe in air, hearts pump oxygenated blood throughout the body, and muscles extract and make use of that oxygen. If any one of these components is weak or inefficient, that limits the amount of exercise the body can complete as it struggles to meet oxygen demands. So a higher VO2 max means a person's body is better at transporting and utilizing oxygen, which typically means they're capable of more exercise.

Another important measure of cardiorespiratory fitness is metabolic equivalents (METs), which is the ratio of how hard your body is working during any task or exercise compared to when your body is at rest. So a MET of 3 means your body is working 3 times harder than if you were sitting still. Improving cardiorespiratory fitness will eventually allow you to exercise at higher METs than before and improve your VO2 max.

Together, strength and cardio make up what we think of as “fitness,” which is ultimately the ability to go about your daily life and all its activities without injury or discomfort. There is some research showing that people get the greatest health benefits when they exercise both components. There is currently much more granular evidence showing exactly how cardio benefits health and longevity compared to strength training.

When it comes to cardiorespiratory fitness specifically, researchers have found a clear link to longevity. “Individuals who have higher levels of [cardiovascular] fitness live longer,” says Mark Haykowsky, a professor at the University of Alberta who researches aging and quality of life. In a paper he coauthored, published in 2024, data revealed that people who can run a mile in under 4 minutes — an incredibly difficult feat that would require a high VO2 max — live on average about 5 years longer than their predicted life expectancy.

But you don't need to be an elite runner to see longevity benefits from cardio. In a study of Danish men, researchers found that when participants had higher than average VO2 Max levels in middle age, they ended up living longer on average. A 2009 study from Japan found that just improving your maximum exercise abilities by 1 MET can decrease your risk of mortality by 13 percent.

In another study, Duck-chul Lee, a professor of health and human development at the University of Pittsburgh, found that even small amounts of running can affect fitness and longevity. The results suggested that running for just one hour can add seven hours to your life, regardless of your pace. “That one-to-seven ratio is really sweet,” Lee says. Of course, you cannot run away from death indefinitely, and by his numbers this benefit caps out at around 3 years (which you could hypothetically achieve by running an hour a day for more than 10 years).

When it comes to muscular strength, however, the relationship between being stronger and living longer are less clear. “Interestingly, evidence would suggest that elite power and strength athletes don't receive that same longevity benefit” as endurance athletes, Haykowsky says. It still could be possible that an hour of strength training has some effect on longevity, like an hour of running does, but “we need more data,” Lee says.

Regardless, immense physical strength by itself does not seem to be associated with better health. Bodybuilders, for example, tend to live shorter lives than the average population — though that link is muddied by the potential health impacts of steroid use.

When it comes to cardiorespiratory fitness, it does seem that more is more. There's no cutoff point where health benefits drop off.

However, it's important to distinguish fitness from exercise. While being fitter is better for health, that does not mean that more exercise is always better, says Lee. Doing intense vigorous exercise for prolonged periods won't necessarily improve your fitness at a better rate than taking a more moderate approach.

In his study, Lee found that “runners running less than one hour a week and runners running three hours or more per week showed almost equal benefits on mortality.” Running more than four hours didn't lead to a decline in health benefits, simply a plateau.

James Smoliga, a professor of rehabilitation sciences at Tufts University, is personally fed up with the popularity of marathons and wishes that people would focus more on doing higher-intensity exercise for shorter periods of time. Alternating between short bouts of intense cardio and rest, also known as high-intensity interval training, has been shown to improve VO2 max more effectively than doing moderate cardio for longer. “Being able to run a slow marathon doesn't necessarily make you more fit than somebody that runs a good 5K,” he says.

But how good is good enough? National guidelines recommend 150 minutes of “moderate” intensity aerobic exercise in a week — Smoliga says you can gauge “moderate” as the highest intensity exercise you can do while still carrying on a conversation. Over time, the bar for “moderate” will get higher. At first, you might only be able to chat while running at a 14-minute mile pace, but over the months or years, you might find you can still converse while pacing at a 10-minute mile. You'll be able to do more while not necessarily feeling like you're working harder, up to a point. When eventually that drop-off does happen, it's fine to stay in that moderate-intensity band of workout, says Smoliga. You're still moving your body and contributing to your health.

While you definitely don't need to pay attention to measures like VO2 max or METs to work out well and improve your cardio over time, it can be a good way to track your own personal progress. Many fitness trackers these days will display estimates of your VO2 max, and some might even provide longevity scores based on that and other metrics. But while it can be encouraging to track how your VO2 max changes over time, especially since that's the best measure of cardiorespiratory fitness, other simpler measures like pace or mileage can be just as good for gauging your progress. Plus, focusing too much on improving any one measure can distract from the one variable that should matter most when you're exercising: Does your body feel better?

It's also important not to discount the importance of strength training, especially in older age. Fitness, especially muscular fitness, naturally decreases throughout the lifespan, so staying strong past midlife becomes much more of an uphill battle. Preventing that loss of strength via strength training is important — weaker grip strength in older adults is linked to disability, heart disease, and other chronic diseases.

If you're young, generally healthy, and able, it makes sense to pick cardio as your primary focus for exercise and fitness, says Haykowsky. There's more evidence that you'll get more long-term bang for your buck. But starting in your 50s, as your natural muscle tone declines, “I would say lift weights as your primary focus, but be sure to still be walking and moving as your secondary focus,” Haykowsky says. You still want to include some cardio, but the greater immediate threat to health will be frailty, so strength training should be the priority.

Things like balance and flexibility are also elements of fitness, says Smoliga, just less talked about. But they contribute to health in that they help you live your life without incident, so you don't injure yourself while lifting a package or stepping out of the shower.

While there's no one level of fitness we should all be striving for, experts say that the most important thing is that you're exercising at all. Lee emphasized the fact that the greatest health bump experts observe in people happen when they transition from no fitness to some fitness. Going from some fitness to more fitness is good too, but getting started is what's most important.

The Fed is the final frontier of his quest to dominate every economic institution.

On Sunday night, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell gave a surprise video statement declaring he was under threat of criminal indictments, having been served with grand jury subpoenas from the Department of Justice. On paper, the matter was over cost overruns for renovations to historic Federal Reserve buildings and Powell's related testimony to Congress. But Powell said that these were just a pretext, and the real reason was “a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president.”

Grand jury subpoenas on the Federal Reserve chair are a major escalation of President Donald Trump's war against the central bank. Trump denied any involvement in the investigation, but the perception that it was part of an intimidation campaign against Powell was so strong that it generated unusually strong bipartisan pushback in Congress. Powell, who was nominated by Trump in his first term and later renominated by then-President Joe Biden, is respected among many elected officials in both parties. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), a member of the Senate Banking Committee, has already said he'll oppose any new nominee while these charges are ongoing. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) made a similar statement. Other Republican senators sound, at minimum, concerned.

The confrontation is the dangerous but inevitable result of President Trump's new vision of executive power, one in which the president directly exercises control over economic policymaking without any independent institutions to slow him down. So far it's largely been a successful endeavor — with the notable exception of the Federal Reserve, where Trump has faced higher legal and political hurdles. Perhaps for that reason, it's become the place he's most focused on. The Powell fight will now prove the biggest test yet of his ability to impose his unfettered will on the most powerful economic institutions in the world.

Only a year into his second term, Trump has exercised far more personal power over economic policy decisions than in his first.

He has canceled spending, frozen funds, and pursued aggressive rescissions that treat appropriations as optional. He's dismantled programs supported by Congress in a bipartisan manner, like the foreign aid services at USAID. He's pursued mass firings of federal government workers, bypassing civil service protections, and leading to a nearly 10 percent headcount reduction in 2025. He's unilaterally declared sweeping tariffs across countries and products at levels not seen in a century, raising hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes without Congress. He directed the government to take equity positions in private firms, ranging from a “golden share” arrangement in US Steel, which Trump told reporters he personally controls, to a 9.9 percent stake in Intel. Trump fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner because he baselessly argued one jobs number was “rigged” to make his economy “look less stellar.”

With few exceptions, Trump has largely been unopposed in this effort. Republicans in Congress, who should have an interest in defending their power of the purse to determine government spending, have typically deferred to the president and his power over their party. The Supreme Court looks like it will give the president broad control over regulatory agencies. Though they recently heard a challenge to the legality of Trump's tariffs and may limit them based on how oral arguments went, even there Trump officials say they are prepared to fight an adverse decision with different tariff powers rather than stand down.

But there's one place that Trump has encountered especially stiff resistance: the independence of the central bank.

The unique power of the Fed loomed over the president's earlier efforts to take over independent agencies. In February of last year, shortly upon taking office, Trump issued an executive order, “Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies,” that declared that all independent agencies, including ones designed by Congress to have a layer of independent authority, “must be supervised and controlled by the people's elected President.” This is the direct result of the unitary executive theory, a once fringe but now central conservative constitutional theory, that gives the president direct powers to hire and fire any independent agency head.

The administration soon got to work, firing Democratic commissioners at the Federal Trade Commission, the Merit Systems Protection Board, and the National Labor Relations Board. But the executive order asserting this level of control had a carve-out:

This order shall not apply to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or to the Federal Open Market Committee in its conduct of monetary policy. This order shall apply to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System only in connection with its conduct and authorities directly related to its supervision and regulation of financial institutions. 

It wasn't intuitively clear why the administration lawyers drafting this left the Federal Reserve's monetary policy outside their newly claimed powers, while insisting they do control how the Federal Reserve regulates the financial system. The Federal Reserve is like any other independent agency created by Congress. If the president can claim these powers over other agencies, why would it stop there?

The answer lies in the Fed's unique importance to the economy. The central bank is tasked with pursuing a “dual mandate” of low inflation and low unemployment, which it pursues mainly by controlling interest rates. Keeping inflation down can sometimes require raising rates in order to deliberately slow the economy, which is why the Fed is supposed to make these decisions instead of politicians, who are unlikely to want to tank the job market in an election year. Fed chairs are granted 4-year terms and governors are granted 14-year terms in order to further insulate them from political considerations. Anything that throws that independence into question risks creating an expectation that the US won't take inflation seriously, which could have untold spillover effects across the economy.

The Supreme Court stepped into this vacuum with Trump v. Wilcox in May of 2025, which allowed the firings at the NLRB and MSPB to stay in place for the time being. But they went out of their way to say that any likely decisions on these fronts wouldn't impact the Federal Reserve. Why? As the Court wrote, “The Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.”

This didn't make much sense to financial and legal historians, who argued there was little in the law to distinguish between the two categories. But it looked like the Supreme Court wanted to find a way to ensure central bank independence while giving the executive branch control over everything else, given the potential economic upheaval.

It was probably inevitable that, even when granted personal control over so much of the government, Trump would become fixated on the one place the Supreme Court wanted him to avoid.

In the ensuing months, Trump pushed against Federal Reserve independence in other ways, sending Powell a note in June with central bank rates for other countries and saying that Powell should be cutting rates faster. He publicly started attacking Powell for “costing” Americans too much money on interest payments and complained he needed lower rates to make it easier to finance federal budget deficits.

Even jawboning the Fed was widely considered, at minimum, indelicate before Trump. But things escalated from a war of words to more serious territory when the administration initiated a legal investigation into a Federal Reserve governor who votes on interest rates, Lisa Cook. Last August, the Department of Justice opened criminal investigations into Cook based on a referral from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) and its head Bill Pulte based on a mortgage application. These kinds of FHFA allegations have conspicuously been used against many political opponents under Trump, including New York state Attorney General Letitia James, Sen. Adam Schiff of California, and California Rep. Eric Swalwell (Pulte is also reported to be behind the Powell investigation.)

Trump used the Cook investigation as a pretext to attempt to fire her from the Federal Reserve over a decade before her 14-year term was supposed to expire. The move was blocked by the Supreme Court while they examined the issue, with a case that will be heard next week.

That the Supreme Court has handed Trump such expansive new powers and protections while trying to hold this one line on central bank independence, and that Trump doesn't respect that line, suggests it will take intense pushback from the courts and Congress alike to maintain it.

But even if the line does hold, the president has lots of new powers under this new centralized control system to effect monetary policy. Trump has claimed control over the Federal Reserve's financial regulatory authority, and it's at least possible the Supreme Court sides with him even if it preserves its role in setting interest rates. As macroeconomic analyst Matthew Klein notes, this authority is prone to abuse. One way that monetary policy works is through financial markets, making it more attractive to take out loans and borrow. If Trump and his appointees can determine how strict financial regulations are based on political considerations, it gives him a substantial amount of control over monetary policy in practice.

Moreover, Trump can direct his agencies to do de facto monetary policy. On Friday, Pulte announced that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would launch a major $200 billion mortgage bond buying program. Putting direct pressure on lowering mortgage rates through financial markets feels very similar to the quantitative easing programs the Federal Reserve has executed during recessions. There are times, especially in deep recessions, where fiscal and monetary policies can and should coordinate. But these are not those times, and simply lowering mortgage rates outside any kind of broader housing market reforms or other efforts to bring down rates is likely to have unintended consequences.

It's easy to say that this campaign against the Federal Reserve is happening because the Trump administration doesn't understand economic policy or simply wants to juice growth no matter the longer-term trade-offs. But it's also the inevitable result of conservative courts and a Republican Congress abetting Trump: As he amasses more and more control over the government's power to tax, spend, and regulate, it comes as no surprise he wants to control the ability to print money. And given his success in steamrolling these checks and balances, who will stop him?

What rules and God-pizza teach us about “mechanical values” and living a good life.

We have a choice. We could leave our goals and values fuzzy. We can value things like wisdom, communication, friendship, or community. These are recognizable and very human values. But without further sharpening, we will probably disagree viciously about how to apply them.

Or we can make our values mechanical. The more explicit and mechanical we make our goals and values, the easier it will be to coordinate, and the easier it will be to figure out exactly how well we've done. Instead of aiming at health, we can aim at achieving our step-count goals. Instead of aiming at community and connection, we can aim at Likes and Follows. Instead of aiming at educating our students for wisdom and reflection, we can aim at standardized test scores, fast graduation rates, and higher salaries.

Yet it can also feel like these mechanical values are systematically missing out on something else, something crucial — something hard to name but absolutely essential to human life. There is a gap between what's easy to count and what's really important.

To get a clearer grip on what that something is, we need to understand what happens when we change between fuzzy values and mechanical values. Mechanical values — and the mechanical rules at their heart — are one of the most important hidden drivers of the modern world.

The upside to mechanical values is that they're easy to apply. It's very hard to agree with other people about what counts as a full life, as great art, or as a soul-nourishing vocation. But it's easy to agree about what leads to statistically longer lifespans, more page views and engagement hours, or more money. When we turn our values mechanical, we make it easy to agree on who did better. We can compare our achievements instantly, and automatically; there is no arguing about which post got more Likes. But we also lose something.

Why do mechanical values seem so thin and insensitive? Mechanical values turn life into something like a game; at least, they take away our fuzzy, but deeply felt human values, and replace with clear, cut-and-dried rules for judging how well we did, and who won. But what does that do? For help, we can turn to the intellectual historian Lorraine Daston, who has given us a profound investigation into the nature of a rule. Because mechanical values are rule systems for evaluating success — and failure.

Historically, says Daston, we've used three incredibly different ideas of a rule. The first kind of rule is a principle. This is a general abstract statement about what to do — but there are exceptions. A principle isn't meant to be applied unthinkingly and automatically. It's supposed to be applied with judgment and care — and the knowledge that the rule won't always work.

When I was taking creative writing classes, my teachers always told us the rule: “Show, don't tell.” And for the most part, good fiction follows the “show, don't tell” rule. But if you search through great literature, you'll find plenty of exceptions. Tolstoy starts Anna Karenina with one of the finest opening lines in all of literature: “Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” Tolstoy is telling and not showing.

I was the kind of smart‑ass who loved pointing out exceptions like this. But my creative writing teacher said that I was missing the point. “Show, don't tell” is a general guideline, not an absolute rule. If you really know what you're doing — if you understand the deep reason underneath the simple rule — you know when to break it. Principles are generalities meant to be applied with care, judgment, and discretion.

To be an algorithm is to be a rule that has been written to be used without significant skill, judgment, or discretion.

The second kind of rule is what Daston calls a model. This is an ideal — a role model, an exemplar. Daston turns to an old religious manual, The Rule of Saint Benedict. And it turns out the rule here isn't some explicit statement in words. The rule is Saint Benedict himself, the actual historical person. To follow the rule of Saint Benedict isn't to follow some explicit procedure, but to model yourself on Saint Benedict, to do what he would have done. This is the kind of rule embodied in mottoes like “What would Jesus do?” And notice that when you apply a model, you aren't following some formula. You have a complex and open‑ended process: activating your understanding of this model person, and imagining how they'd act in some new situation.

Principles and models both require careful judgment to apply. Whether such a rule applies to this particular case will always be open to interpretation and up for debate.

The third kind of rule is completely different. This is a rule as an algorithm, an explicit directive meant to be applied mechanically — without discretion or judgment, exactly as it is written, with no exceptions. And it is this algorithmic conception of a rule that has become dominant in the past century, says Daston.

You might think algorithmic rules arose with the rise of computing machines. But they actually showed up about a hundred years earlier, she says, in a move to cheapen labor. Older mathematical methods often involved principles — that is, mathematical rules that had to be applied with care and discretion. For a given problem, you would have your choice of different mathematical tools and methods, each of which would yield a different result.

A simplified example: There are many different methods to split a slice of pie in two. You can do it by weight. You can divide it according to an exact angle, which you have measured with a protractor. Or you can use the “I cut, you choose” method. Each yields a slightly different result, and different situations call for different methods. If the goal is to create two perfect‑looking slices of pie for an advertising photo shoot, maybe you want a protractor. If you are a chemist trying to figure out the exact caloric count of a serving of pie, you should use weight. If the goal is to let two feuding siblings split a piece of pie without either of them feeling like they got screwed, then use the “I cut, you choose” method.

For complicated problems, choosing the right method took a considerable amount of expertise, so you had to hire people with lots of mathematical training and experience in the right field. Such trained mathematicians were rare and expensive. So corporations and governments spent a lot of resources creating an alternative to expensive, experienced experts: rule sets that anybody could mechanically follow.

Early examples of algorithmic rules include logarithm tables and various tables for performing navigational calculations. Such tables could be used by virtually anybody, and their work could be checked by virtually anybody else. There was no choice about which method to use: You just took some numbers and plugged them into the charts. So now you could hire cheaper workers — basically unskilled labor — to do the same job. And anybody could audit a worker's performance; you didn't need to pay another specialized expert to check over your first specialized expert's work.

To be an algorithm here doesn't mean that something is executed on a machine rather than by a human. To be an algorithm is to be a rule that has been written to be used without significant skill, judgment, or discretion. It is a procedure that anybody can follow.

This all might seem pretty abstract. So let's turn to thinking about a very familiar and concrete case of mechanical rules: recipes.

My mother was an excellent cook. She learned to cook not from cookbooks and recipes, but from her family and friends in Vietnam. Like a lot of people from her generation, she cooked relatively few dishes, but she cooked them extraordinarily well.

I learned to cook through recipes, using a few key classic cookbooks: Julia Child's French cookbooks and Marcella Hazan's Italian cookbooks. And I got great results. So on one visit home, I asked my mom to teach me my very favorite Vietnamese dish: hot and sour catfish soup. So she did — or she tried to.

What she gave me wasn't anything I could follow; it was nothing like a recipe at all. There were no clear measurements, nothing like “add 2 cups of broth” or “simmer for 30 minutes.” It seemed to me, at the time, like this vast and disorganized ramble, a weird organic messy flowchart of possibilities and decisions and judgment calls. I was supposed to add tomato and pineapple but I was supposed to taste the ingredients first. If one was sweet and the other sour, I was probably fine. But if they were both particularly sweet, I would need to balance them with some extra vinegar. Or if they were both sour, I might need to add a little brown sugar. My mom wouldn't ever tell me how much; it all depended on how things were tasting that day. And I had to smell the catfish — was it a particularly clean, farmed variety, or was it one of those funky‑smelling wild ones?

I was horrified by the mess of what she was giving me. And what I said to her then, to my eternal shame, was: “Mom, what is this Third World bullshit? Give me a real recipe!”

What I didn't understand then was that my mom was giving me something profoundly real. But it was completely different from the kinds of tidy recipes I was used to from my modern cookbooks. I was used to recipes where I didn't have to taste the food as I went, where I didn't have to make judgment calls — where I could just dump in the required ingredients in the exact specified amounts.

These precise, modern recipes had, in a weird way, disrupted my sense of what cooking was and could be. I had come to assume that cooking — real cooking — had to proceed via an algorithm. I had refused to accept that real cooking might involve a messy and organic decision space, full of a thousand decision points and judgment calls.

Recipes didn't always look so precise. If you look at cookbooks from the early 20th century, you often find recipes like this: “Beat 2-3 eggs, and then blend handsful of flour until just barely workable. Knead until firm, and bake in a hot oven until it makes a nice ringing sound when knocked.”

That old‑school recipe is made up of principles: meant to be applied with judgment and flexibility. Our new‑school recipes are made up of algorithms, meant to be applied mechanically.

Let me be clear here: I learned to cook from algorithmic recipes, and I never would have been able to get a start with cooking Japanese, Mexican, or Russian food without them. Algorithmic recipes are a useful means of finding your way into a new cuisine.

Algorithmic recipes are also great if you're a massive fast‑food franchise and want to use low‑skill, replaceable employees to produce food that tastes the same in every location. To make this work, industrial‑scale food companies need to make sure that the buns and the burger patties and the cheese are exactly the same. Standardized inputs plus algorithmic procedures equals consistent results, without any need for expert workers. But notice: Here, the algorithmic recipe isn't just a starting point; it's where we end up.

The relative disadvantages of the algorithmic recipe are rather subtler, but they are very real. So what are the downsides of following an algorithmic recipe precisely, exactly as it's written? What is the cost of engineered accessibility?

Back in an earlier era of my life, when I was a food writer, I interviewed an incredible pizza chef in LA. He ran a wild‑yeast sourdough Neapolitan pizza shop called Mother Dough that made some of the most glorious, absurdly radiant pizzas I have ever had in my life.

He wasn't from Naples; he was Lebanese. He told me that one day, eating a perfect Neapolitan pizza, he'd had a mystical insight about the unity of all the flatbread traditions, about the beautiful spectrum that encompassed both Lebanese flatbreads and Neapolitan pizza. So he moved to Naples and apprenticed himself to a pizza master for a decade, and then moved to LA and opened up his shop.

When we adopt mechanical values, we make ourselves perfectly replaceable — in valuing and judging what's important.

I asked him how he made pizza so good — God‑pizza, pizza that sang with the most delicate balance of crispy to chewy, that gave me the most angelic hit of pure beauty, while smacking me with pure animal gut‑joy. He pointed out the enormous wood‑fired copper pizza oven at the back of the shop.

“See that?” he said. “That's the temperature gauge. I painted it over, with black paint, so I couldn't look at it. It's a distraction. You have to put your hand here”— he placed his hand directly at the open mouth of the pizza oven — “and feel how it's breathing. It will tell you how the pizza wants to be cooked that day. You can't trust the temperature gauge to tell you the truth.”

What he meant was that temperature wasn't all that mattered, but if you had the temperature gauge, you would be tempted to hyper‑focus on it to the exclusion of all else. Baking is a complex act, where a live product — yeast and dough — reacts to a complex set of ever‑changing environmental qualities. Temperature matters, but also humidity, air flow, air pressure. And all that atmospheric stuff is changing, every day. There is no single correct baking time and temperature. What you need to do changes each day, in response to those changing variables.

And this pizza chef had learned to perform, by feel, a complex synthesis of all these factors. He had painted over his temperature gauge because it was a distraction. It tempted you to focus completely on one thing, to treat the single measurement it tracked — temperature — as the all‑important one, instead of looking at the complex interaction of all the relevant qualities.

His shop was also incredibly consistent. It produced amazing wood‑fired pizzas, and he nailed that exact texture of dough every single day. Other shops — those where people were following an algorithm, baking a pizza with an exact amount of time and temperature each day — were actually far more inconsistent in their results. They had crispy pizza dough one day and rubbery dough the next, even though their procedure was more consistent. Why? Because the rigidity of the algorithm, when followed mechanically, prevents the cooks from adapting to continually changing conditions. Air pressure changes, humidity changes, yeast changes, but the algorithm remains the same. The true master cook adapts their procedures to changing inputs.

A recipe is an example of a mechanical procedure. A procedure is mechanical if it's consistently applicable, by different people, without the need for judgment. And that consistency is often quite narrow. A mechanical recipe leads to consistency in procedure, but not necessarily in the final results.

By implementing mechanical procedures, we can rid ourselves of the need for skill or sensitivity, to varying degrees. Your typical recipe is built to be followed by anybody who can read and has access to some basic cup measures. There are also mechanical procedures for experts, like a standard procedure for running a test for chem lab techs. These are written assuming a greater level of background knowledge, but once you have that background knowledge, it'll be executed in the same way, by all users — without the need for judgment.

Here is the trade‑off between fuzzy principles and mechanical procedures. Fuzzy principles, like those old‑school recipes, require the trained judgment of a highly experienced person to apply, which means they can use all the experience, sensitivity, and attunement of that judge. They can use complex cues for action, like “Bake until it makes a hollow ringing sound,” or “Add pineapple until it tastes balanced.” That linguistic fuzziness opens a space for expertise and sensitivity. Fuzzy language is a cue for the person executing the rule to exercise their own judgment, to adapt. But that procedure won't be as easy to execute by the public at large, nor can the public as easily inspect and oversee other people's applications of the procedure. And different experts might end up doing different things following that procedure.

A mechanical procedure, on the other hand, is highly repeatable and accessible. Mechanical procedures work best with the kinds of things that are naturally public and observable by everybody. This is when we truly get to harness the power of scale, and reap the rewards of massive collections of data. But other times, the situation may be subtler — something that requires discernment, sensitivity, and expertise to notice. And in those cases, mechanical procedures are far less accurate. They will miss the mark in subtle terrain, because they're bound by the demand that the steps be clear and explicit enough that they may be consistently applied by anybody.

So: When we're adopting mechanical values, what we're really doing is accepting mechanical rules for evaluating what's important. We're taking on a mechanical procedure for evaluating our successes and failures.

Mechanical evaluation systems have power. They protect us from a certain kind of corruption and bias. They make agreement automatic, our conclusions inarguable. But they also introduce a new kind of bias: a bias toward paying attention to the kinds of things that we can count mechanically.

From the perspective of the big organization, though, mechanical procedures are incredibly efficient. When we standardize a system, we make the parts easy to replace. When we standardize nuts and bolts, it's no big deal when you lose a ¼” bolt. You can just get another one. And when you standardize work — when you give workers mechanical rules to follow — then it's no big deal to fire a particular worker, because you can find another and just slot them into place.

So when we adopt mechanical values, we make ourselves perfectly replaceable — in valuing and judging what's important. If you're running a restaurant and aiming for the delicate balance between crisp and soft chewiness of true Neopolitan pizza, then you need to hire people with the experience and sensitivity to tell — who know in their hearts the subtle feel of true Neopolitan pizza. But if you're aiming to maximize sales, then anybody can judge that — and anybody can understand it. Mechanical values make it easier to communicate, easier to explain ourselves. Mechanical values are designed to make self-justification frictionless. They make our loves and desires utterly transparent.

But to get that, we must sacrifice any subtlety in our values. We can no longer seek targets that require experience or discernment to detect. The power of mechanical values is accessibility. The price we pay is our sensitivity.

Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski has expressed support for President Donald Trump's call to cap US credit card interest rates at 10% for one year.

""I think Trump is wise here and is proposing something that makes a lot of sense,"" Siemiatkowski told CNBC on Monday.

Siemiatkowski said traditional credit cards are designed to push consumers to put most or all of their spending on credit and carry large balances at high interest rates. That structure, he said, incentivizes people to borrow as much as possible and leads to higher losses, particularly among lower-income borrowers.

""Capitalism is great, but anarchy is not,"" Siemiatkowski said, arguing that some limits are needed to protect consumers.

While some critics argue that buy now, pay later services can still encourage overspending, Siemiatkowski said Klarna is built around smaller purchases with fixed, interest-free payments.

He added Klarna approves purchases in real time based on a customer's current spending behavior, rather than income data that may be outdated. That approach, he said, leads customers to borrow less and fall behind on payments less often.

In a separate interview with CNN, Siemiatkowski criticized credit card rewards programs such as cash back and airline miles, saying they mainly benefit wealthier consumers while lower-income borrowers bear more of the costs.

Even people who don't use credit cards, he said, pay more for everyday goods because merchants raise prices to cover card fees, while wealthier shoppers get that money back through rewards.

""This is the most effective income redistribution program in the world,"" Siemiatkowski told CNN.

Trump's weekend call to cap interest rates for a year sparked a sell-off in major financial stocks on Monday, including Capital One, Synchrony Financial, JPMorgan, and Citigroup.

Analysts at UBS and Goldman Sachs have warned that a 10% cap on credit card interest rates could backfire as lenders would cut back on credit availability, making it harder for some consumers to borrow.

But there could be some winners, too.

SoFi CEO Anthony Noto said on Saturday the proposal could push consumers away from credit cards and toward personal loans.

President Donald Trump said on Monday that even though data centers are ""key"" to the AI boom, tech companies must ""'pay their own way,'"" so that Americans don't have higher utility bills.

""First up is Microsoft, who my team has been working with, and which will make major changes beginning this week to ensure that Americans don't 'pick up the tab' for their POWER consumption, in the form of paying higher Utility bills,"" Trump said on Truth Social, hinting at additional announcements in the coming weeks.

Data centers drove up utility bills in at least 13 states, Business Insider previously reported.

Over the past year, Microsoft has been planning for data centers in Wisconsin, Atlanta, Texas, and Michigan.

The White House and Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The pressure on Big Tech to self-fund its energy needs comes as the Trump administration leans into the AI race with the Stargate Project, which is a massive $500 billion joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank announced by Trump early in 2025 to build AI infrastructure. As of 2026, at least one data center under the project is already underway in Texas.

Such buildouts are energy-intensive. OpenAI's data center plans will cost $400 billion and require seven gigawatts of power, Business Insider previously wrote, more than that of the entire New York City. 

Some tech companies are also moving their planned facilities off the grid entirely for easier permitting and less community resistance. To shield residents and small businesses from rate hikes, utilities in states like Indiana and Ohio have also started enforcing tariffs on power-hungry tech facilities.

In this article

President Donald Trump on Tuesday slammed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell as either ""incompetent"" or ""crooked,"" even as his Department of Justice faces growing opposition over its criminal investigation of the central bank leader.

Trump threw his latest punch at Powell after being asked whether the unprecedented action undermines confidence in the Fed, which has long enjoyed independence from the executive branch. 

""He's billions of dollars over budget,"" Trump said, apparently referencing costs related to a multibillion-dollar renovation of the Fed's Washington headquarters, which is at the center of DOJ's probe.

""So, he either is incompetent or he's crooked,"" Trump said. ""I don't know what he is. But he does a – certainly he doesn't do a very good job.""

Trump's comments to reporters outside the White House came as bipartisan criticism of the investigation, and support for the Fed's independence, continues to grow.

""Everyone we know believes in Fed independence,"" JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told reporters earlier Tuesday after his bank released its fourth-quarter earnings results.

""Anything that chips away at that is probably not a great idea,"" Dimon said. ""And in my view, it will have the reverse consequences, it will raise inflation expectations and probably increase rates over time.""

Dimon's remarks echoed similar concerns from a slew of Republican lawmakers, including some who are reliable supporters of Trump.

""If you wanted to design a system to guarantee that interest rates would go up and not down, the best way to do that would be to have the Federal Reserve and the executive branch of the United States get in a pissing contest,"" Senate Banking Committee member John Kennedy, R-La., said Monday.

""We need this like we need a hole in the head,"" he added.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, expressed concerns to Trump that the DOJ probe could complicate existing plans to confirm the next Fed chair after Powell's term expires in May, CNBC has learned.

But U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro signaled overnight that her office in Washington, D.C., has no plans to drop its legal effort against the Fed and Powell.

""The United States Attorney's Office contacted the Federal Reserve on multiple occasions to discuss cost overruns and the chairman's congressional testimony, but were ignored, necessitating the use of legal process—which is not a threat,"" Pirro wrote in an X post.

""The word 'indictment' has come out of Mr. Powell's mouth, no one else's. None of this would have happened if they had just responded to our outreach,"" Pirro wrote.

""This office makes decisions based on the merits, nothing more and nothing less. We agree with the chairman of the Federal Reserve that no one is above the law, and that is why we expect his full cooperation,"" she added.

Powell, on Sunday night, said the DOJ served grand jury subpoenas and threatened a ""criminal indictment"" based on his prior Senate testimony about the ongoing renovations of the central bank office buildings.

Powell directly connected the probe to Trump's frequent complaints about the Fed lowering interest rates too slowly.

""The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,"" he said in a video statement.

""No one, certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve, is above the law,"" Powell said. ""But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.""

Trump has said the subpoenas have nothing to do with his views on interest rates.

""No. I wouldn't even think of doing it that way,"" Trump told NBC News on Sunday night. ""What should pressure him is the fact that rates are far too high. That's the only pressure he's got.""

In this article

Crude oil prices rose about 3% on Tuesday, after U.S. President Donald Trump canceled all meetings with Iranian officials and promised protesters that help is on the way. 

U.S. crude oil rose $1.96, or 3.29%, to $61.46 per barrel by 11:42 a.m. ET. Global benchmark Brent was up $1.99, or 3.12%, to $65.86 per barrel. 

The Islamic Republic's security forces have cracked down on large-scale demonstrations with hundreds of people reportedly dead. The government has cut off Internet access in Iran, making it difficult to verify how the situation is evolving on the ground. 

Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene if the Islamic Republic kills protestors. 

""Iranian Patriots, KEEP PROTESTING - TAKE OVER YOUR INSTITUTIONS!!! Save the names of the killers and abusers,"" Trump said in a Truth Social post Tuesday. 

""They will pay a big price,"" the president said. ""I have cancelled all meetings with Iranian Officials until the senseless killing of protesters STOPS. HELP IS ON ITS WAY. MIGA!!!""

Iran is a member of OPEC and a major crude oil producer. The oil market is monitoring whether the unrest could lead to a disruption of supplies.

Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said Tuesday that the Arctic island chooses Denmark over the U.S., pushing back against Donald Trump's repeated takeover threats.  

""If we have to choose between the USA and Denmark here and now, we choose Denmark. We choose NATO, the Kingdom of Denmark and the EU,"" Nielsen said, according to translated comments reported by Danish public broadcaster DR. 

He was speaking alongside Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen at a news conference in Copenhagen, ahead of crunch talks between U.S., Danish and Greenlandic officials at the White House on Wednesday.

""The time has come to stand together,"" Nielsen added.

""It has not been easy to stand up to completely unacceptable pressure from our closest allies for a lifetime. But there is much to suggest that the hardest part is still ahead of us,"" Frederiksen said.

Trump's renewed interest in acquiring Greenland follows an audacious U.S. military operation to seize Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on Jan. 3.

Trump, who has long advocated for control over Greenland, has said the U.S. needs the Arctic island to prevent Russia and China from doing the same, telling reporters that Washington would acquire the self-governing Danish territory ""one way or the other.""

The U.S. president has also said that the mineral-rich island, which is strategically situated between Europe and North America, is vital ""from the standpoint of national security.""

Opinion polls have previously shown that Greenlanders overwhelmingly oppose U.S. control, while a strong majority support independence from Denmark.

Denmark has pledged to boost health-care spending and infrastructure investments in recent months, while also seeking to defuse tensions with the Trump administration by investing in Arctic defense, including the purchase of 16 additional F-35 fighter jets.

Nike has signed a deal with No. 1-ranked pickleball player Anna Leigh Waters, making her the first pickleball athlete to join Nike's roster. 

While the terms of the deal were not disclosed, Waters will represent Nike for both apparel and footwear across all of her events and professional tournaments. The 18-year-old will also serve as a global pickleball ambassador for Nike. She previously had an apparel and footwear deal with Fila that expired in 2025. 

Pickleball has seen explosive growth in recent years, but up until now, Nike has been slow to jump on the trend. The company is currently in the midst of a turnaround plan under new CEO Elliott Hill after lagging sales and a stock slump. 

The new partnership caps off a record-breaking year for Waters. She is currently ranked No. 1 in women's singles, doubles and mixed doubles, with a record 181 gold medals and 39 career triple crowns (winning singles, doubles and mixed doubles at one event). Waters' pickleball career began in 2019, when she became the youngest pro pickleball player at the age of 12. 

""Growing up, I watched my idols wear the Swoosh in their biggest moments, so joining the Nike family is a dream realized,"" Waters in a statement. ""Nike is the gold standard in performance and I can't wait to step onto the court representing a brand that believes in the same relentless pursuit of greatness that drives me every day.""

Last week, Waters announced she was switching paddle companies and joining Franklin Sports. Waters also has deals with major brands including Delta Air Lines, DoorDash and Ulta Beauty. She currently makes $2 million annually from the United Pickleball Association, according to a person familiar with Waters' earnings, who asked to remain anonymous to speak about nonpublic matters. 

Her new Nike partnership will debut this week as she competes at the Carvana Masters in Rancho Mirage, California, according to a representative for Waters.

Happy Tuesday. Nothing quite says the holidays are over like the beginning of a new corporate earnings season.

Stock futures are ticking lower this morning following a winning day.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

The criminal investigation of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was the top headline for business leaders and investors yesterday, but it didn't result in the risk-off pressure some expected. Instead, the U.S. stock market battled through the turmoil to new reach new records.

Here's what to know:

JPMorgan Chase surpassed analyst expectations on both lines for the fourth quarter, sending shares up around 1% in premarket trading. The bank also said trading revenue came in stronger than forecasted.

JPMorgan is one of the first major companies to report earnings in the new year. It precedes fellow financial giants Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, all set to share results later this week.

Bank stocks, including JPMorgan, are coming off a harsh session after Trump called for a 10% one-year cap for credit card interest rates. As CNBC's Hugh Son reports, industry executives scrambled over the weekend to come up with action plans should Trump's idea — which they see as detrimental to their business models — materialize.

Speaking of earnings: Shares of Delta Air Lines tumbled 5% this morning after the airline posted slightly lower revenue than Wall Street anticipated for the fourth quarter. However, Delta beat earnings per share expectations and projected a 20% profit jump in 2026, citing strong travel demand.

""We expect not just a 20% increase in EPS for the year,"" Delta CEO Ed Bastian told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" this morning. ""We're expecting a 50% increase in EPS for the first quarter.""

Bookings have been solid for both leisure and business travel in 2026 so far, according to the Atlanta-based company.

CNBC's Morning Squawk recaps the biggest stories investors should know before the stock market opens, every weekday morning.

Trump said on social media yesterday that he would institute a 25% tariff on any country that does business with Iran, effective immediately. The president did not provide any other details about the order, which he said was ""final and conclusive,"" and a White House spokesperson declined to answer CNBC's questions about the policy.

The new tariff — an apparent effort to economically isolate the Middle Eastern country — comes after Trump threatened to take military action against Iran over the reported killing of dozens of anti-government protesters.

Siri is getting an artificial-intelligence powered upgrade with the help of Alphabet.

The Google parent's Gemini models will be used to help Apple roll out an enhanced version of its virtual assistant software, the companies announced in a joint statement obtained by CNBC. The upgraded Siri is expected later this year.

As CNBC's Samantha Subin notes, the deal marks another win for Google in the AI race against OpenAI.

Shares of Alphabet rose after the Siri announcement yesterday, helping it become the fourth company to reach a $4 trillion market cap. Here's what the path has looked like for Class C shares:

Sports merchandising giant Fanatics announced on Tuesday the launch of Fanatics Studios, a media and entertainment studio established as a joint venture with OBB Media.

Fanatics Studios will create, produce and distribute content at the intersection of sports and culture, the company said in a release. This will include feature films, documentaries, scripted and unscripted content, live events and digital series. 

OBB Media founder and CEO Michael Ratner will serve as CEO of the company. 

""I'm incredibly excited about launching Fanatics Studios and adding an important content and media business to our growing sports platform that also supports all of our existing businesses,"" Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin said in a statement. 

Rubin acquired e-commerce site Fanatics in 2011 and has built the company into a cross-sector juggernaut. Fanatics has broadened its reach among sports fans through collectibles, sports betting, live shopping and events. 

Fanatics now employs more than 22,000 people and is valued at more than $30 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter. The company expects $13 billion in revenue in 2026.

Fanatics estimates the new content studio will record nine-figure revenue in its first year of operation, making it a meaningful part of the business, the person said. 

The company already has a slate of projects that includes serving as a content partner for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, a flag football tournament taking place in Saudi Arabia and a multipart documentary on seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady. 

Fanatics Studios will also do projects with ESPN, WWE and Major League Baseball, the company said. 

""Together, we are going to continue pushing our mission of relentlessly enhancing the fan experience by creating content that brings fans closer than ever to the teams, players, sports, cultural moments and events that they love in a way that's never been done before,"" Rubin said.

Microsoft on Tuesday promised that consumers won't pay more when the software maker sets up data centers near their communities.

The company also committed to replenish more water than it uses, and to add to local tax bases in places where it has data centers.

""Our pledge to each of these communities is that we will pay our way as a company, to ensure that our data centers don't increase your electricity prices,"" Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and vice chair, said at an event held in Great Falls, Virginia, less than 20 miles from the White House. 

The company will sign deals with utilities in advance, so they can afford to invest in infrastructure that can support new data centers, Smith said.

Smith made a similar statement in September in Racine, Wisconsin, near a company data center that's set to come online in early 2026.

""We will pay utility rates that are high enough to cover our electricity costs in part by collaborating with utilities on plans to add the electricity supply that we will need,"" Smith said. 

The move comes as utility prices rise across the U.S., where technology companies are racing to build data centers that can run generative artificial intelligence models such as the ones that power OpenAI's popular ChatGPT assistant. 

Utilities charged U.S. consumers 6% more for electricity in August from a year earlier, including in states with many data centers, CNBC reported in November.

These facilities contain special-purpose processors that generally require large amounts of energy to operate. 

In Caledonia, Wisconsin, where Microsoft was looking to build a data center last year, residents had grievances about water and power use, among other implications. 

The company decided not to move forward at the site it had considered in the village, citing local feedback

We Energies, a local utility in Wisconsin, has proposed a special electricity rate for large clients' data centers, and Microsoft is asking the state's Public Service Commission to raise the rate the company pays, Smith said.

""We will not go into a local community and ask them to create a local property tax reduction or abatement in order to attract a data center from Microsoft,"" Smith said Tuesday.

On Monday, hours before Microsoft's event, President Donald Trump said in a Truth Social post that his administration has been working with the company, which ""will make major changes beginning this week to ensure that Americans don't 'pick up the tab' for their POWER consumption.""

The company has maintained a healthy conversation with the White House going back to Trump's inauguration last year, Smith told CNBC's Eamon Javers.

""We really rely on their leadership at the federal level, especially Chris Wright and the Energy Department, Doug Burgum and Interior, and across the government,"" Smith said on CNBC. Burgum, secretary of the Interior Department and formerly governor of North Dakota, spent six years as a Microsoft executive after the technology company in 2001 acquired Great Plains Software, where he was CEO.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told analysts in October that the company plans to nearly double its data center footprint over the next two years. 

Microsoft has been building data centers for over 15 years. In the September quarter, the company spent nearly $35 billion on capital expenditures and finance leases for cloud and artificial intelligence infrastructure, up 75% year over year.

""Our goal is to move quickly, partner with local communities, and bring these commitments to life in the first half of this year,"" Smith wrote in a blog post.

Salesforce is bolstering its Slack app with generative artificial intelligence to help users find relevant information and sort through the mountains of communication chaos. 

After announcing plans in October to bring generative AI to Slackbot, its virtual assistant, Salesforce said on Tuesday that it will become available to Business+ and Enterprise+ Slack subscribers.

""Because it lives inside Slack, Slackbot understands your conversations, files, channels, and the people you work with,"" the company said in a blog post. ""It only sees what you can see, always respecting your permissions and access controls.""

Slackbot can find data in Slack, Salesforce, Google Drive, Box, Atlassian's Confluence and other services. It's using Anthropic's Claude model, though Salesforce is testing alternatives, co-founder and technology chief Parker Harris told CNBC. 

While the artificial intelligence boom has lifted the fortunes of tech companies ranging from chipmakers like Nvidia and Broadcom to internet giant Google, Wall Street has remained skeptical of how Salesforce and other enterprise software companies will fare, and whether some of them will ultimately be displaced. Salesforce's stock price is down 18% in the past year, compared with the the Nasdaq's 24% gain over that stretch. 

Harris said that large language models, and the many popular coding agents that are now running atop them, are not disrupting cloud software. And services like OpenAI's ChatGPT aren't hooked into corporate systems. 

""People who say, 'oh I could vibe code up Slack and Salesforce now, and my AI is just going to do it all for me' are crazy,"" said Harris, who's been focusing on Slack in recent years. Salesforce bought Slack for $27.1 billion in 2021, by far its largest purchase on record. 

Since around the time Slack launched in 2014, the Slackbot digital assistant has been able to send people automated messages, including updates from third-party services. But with all the chatbots popping up in the past three years since the release of ChatGPT in late 2022, Slack has been a relative laggard. Google and Microsoft already offer AI add-ons inside their work productivity bundles.

Across the software industry, companies have been incorporating models from the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic with hopes of fueling growth by increasing productivity for clients. Aside from Slackbot, Salesforce has been selling Agentforce services for automating customer service and other business functions. 

Harris said the new Slackbot helps him prepare for meetings and research topics. 

""I'm finding I'm using search less,"" he said, referring to the app's search function.

Slackbot was developed after two Slack engineers considered how CEO Marc Benioff might use an in-house tool instead of instinctively opening ChatGPT and uploading internal documents such as earnings scripts.

""Now he's doing everything with Slackbot,"" Harris said. 

Slack is now used by millions of people in thousands of organizations, a spokesperson said, and is one of the company's fastest-growing cloud offerings. Slackbot is the most quickly adopted feature in Salesforce's 27-year history, Harris said, adding that he expects people to switch to Slack from Microsoft Teams and that companies might now start getting rid of ChatGPT subscriptions when they see what it can do. 

But talent has headed in the other direction. In December, OpenAI hired Slack CEO Denise Dresser to be the startup's chief revenue officer. Rob Seaman, who had been Slack's product chief, became the unit's interim CEO.

Demetri Salvaggio, vice president of customer experience and operations at business travel software company Engine, has been testing Slackbot's new capabilities and said he uses the feature to ""sanity check"" himself at the end of the workday and make sure he hasn't failed to respond to any important messages. Engine has licenses for Google's Gemini assistant and Anthropic's Claude, but they're not embedded in the company's Slack environment, Salvaggio said.

He said Slackbot probably saves him 45 minutes to an hour per week.

In this article

The U.S. government will invest $1 billion in L3Harris Technologies' growing rocket motor business, guaranteeing a steady supply of the much-needed motors used in a wide range of ‍missiles such as Tomahawks and Patriot interceptors.

Shares were ‍up 11.4% in pre-market trading in ‍New York. The deal represents the latest U.S. government investment in Corporate America, which has included a 10% stake in chipmaker Intel and investments in critical mineral producers. It comes just a few days after President Donald Trump blasted defense contractors for slow production of weaponry.

L3Harris said on Tuesday it ‌is planning ‌an IPO of its growing rocket motor business into a new publicly ​traded company backed by a $1 billion government convertible security investment. The securities will automatically convert to common equity when the company goes public later in 2026.

""We are fundamentally shifting our approach to securing our munitions supply chain,"" said Michael Duffey, Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment. ""By investing directly in suppliers we are building the resilient industrial ⁠base needed for the Arsenal of Freedom.""

The investment in a defense contractor is not a total surprise after U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick last August said the Trump administration was weighing equity stakes in major defense contractors, including Lockheed Martin. The investment in Intel has been a boon for the company, whose shares have more than doubled since the announcement. But the government's equity position in L3Harris could face blowback from L3Harris' rivals, given that it creates a potentially significant conflict of interest for the U.S. government. The Pentagon will have an ownership stake in a company that regularly bids on major defense and other government contracts.

The investment marks the first direct-to-supplier partnership of this kind and is an outcome of the department's new Acquisition Transformation Strategy and its ""Go Direct-to-Supplier"" initiative. The strategy calls for the department to negotiate and invest directly with critical suppliers to save money.

L3Harris' Missile Solutions unit, which produces missile propulsion systems for many missiles including Patriot, THAAD, Tomahawk, and the Standard Missile, will be carved out from the company. L3Harris will retain majority ownership and control of the new entity. The deal all but guarantees a steady flow of business for the new ‍unit.

""Recent Trump Administration actions have placed renewed emphasis on strengthening the defense industrial base and reinvigorating competition following a 30-year wave ‌of consolidation,"" Christopher Kubasik, Chairman and CEO, L3Harris said in a statement. ""Building on several years of sustained investment and operational ⁠improvements by L3Harris, this new company will serve as a key partner,"" to the Pentagon.

The Pentagon said in a release that the ""partnership"" with L3Harris positions it ""to negotiate multi-year procurement framework agreements for solid rocket motors, vital to ‍several critical munitions, pending Congressional authorization and appropriations."" Last week, the U.S. inked a separate seven-year agreement with Lockheed Martin to increase production of the PAC-3 missile, the type launched by the Patriot system, to 2,000 units annually from about 600.

The transaction structure—combining a government convertible preferred security with a planned public offering while maintaining parent company control—is highly unusual in the defense sector and may face scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers concerned about conflicts of interest and market competition.

An IPO is planned in the second half of 2026 ⁠and could help the U.S. government turn a profit.

J.P. ‌Morgan Securities LLC is acting as financial advisor to L3Harris, and Vinson & Elkins LLP is acting as legal advisor to L3Harris on the proposed transaction.

In this article

Delta Air Lines' earnings could jump more than 20% this year from 2025 thanks to robust travel demand, particularly at the high end of the market, and potentially reach a record, CEO Ed Bastian said.

Delta on Tuesday forecast adjusted earnings per share of between $6.50 and $7.50 this year, compared with analysts' estimate for $7.25 a share.

The carrier, the first airline to report quarterly results this year, forecast an increase in sales of as much as 7% in the first three months of 2026 and adjusted earnings of between 50 cents per share and 90 cents per share for the first quarter, compared with 72 cents per share forecast by analysts polled by LSEG.

Bastian said Delta sits at the top of the ""K"" in the so-called K-shaped economy, with more revenue coming from higher-spending customers.

""We are looking at our seat growth in the coming year. ... Effectively, none of our growth in seats will be in the main cabin; virtually all will be in the premium sector,"" Bastian told reporters.

Main cabin ticket revenue fell 7% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier to $5.62 billion, while premium ticket revenue, for seats at the front of the plane, rose 9% to nearly $5.7 billion, with that segment overtaking the standard coach class, ahead of Delta's estimate for it to occur this year. For the full year, main cabin revenue was still higher than premium classes.

Bookings are strong from both leisure customers and corporate travelers in the first few days of the year, Delta said. The airline also started 2025 with expectations for a record year, but it trimmed its estimates after President Donald Trump implemented tariffs early last year and the longest-ever government shutdown, which ended in late November, snarled air travel and bookings fell.

Bastian struck a more cautious tone this year, telling reporters ""we're not going to project or commit to a record earnings [forecast] until we understand the uncertainty,"" he said. 

""I think we're well aware of the risk factors,"" he said. ""This past year, and I think again this year ... [will] be more of the geopolitical environment, whether that's international or on domestic policy.""

Here's how the company performed in the fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on consensus estimates from LSEG:

Even with its reduced forecast, Delta posted a profit of $1.22 billion for the fourth quarter, or $1.86 a share, up close to 45% from a year earlier, on revenue of $16 billion, up 3% from 2024. Adjusting for one-time items, Delta posted earnings of $1.02 billion or $1.55 a share, slightly ahead of estimates. 

Bastian said premium product growth is outpacing sales growth for the main cabin, continuing an existing trend.

Delta also said Tuesday it will buy 30 Boeing 787-10 Dreamliners, its first of the long-haul planes from the U.S. manufacturer, as sales pick up for bigger jets. 

Delta made the Airbus A350 its key long-haul plane almost a decade ago and later increased its reliance on the European plane maker when it retired its Boeing 777s during the pandemic. Delta said deliveries would begin in 2031, the latest sign of how airlines are snatching up delivery slots into the next decade.

The carrier has options for 30 more 787-10s from Boeing.

Correction: Revenue of $16 billion was up 3% from 2024. An earlier version misstated the year.

Global central bankers issued a statement Tuesday defending U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell following the launch of a criminal investigation into the central bank chief. 

""We stand in full solidarity with the Federal Reserve System and its Chair Jerome H. Powell,"" central bank chiefs including European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, said in a joint statement. 

""The independence of central banks is a cornerstone of price, financial and economic stability in the interest of the citizens that we serve. It is therefore critical to preserve that independence, with full respect for the rule of law and democratic accountability,"" they added.

Powell has served with ""integrity, focused on his mandate and an unwavering commitment to the public interest,"" the statement said. 

""To us, he is a respected colleague who is held in the highest regard by all who have worked with him.""

Other signatories to the statement included the central bank chiefs of Brazil, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, South Korea, Australia and Canada.

The message of solidarity with Powell comes after the Fed chief issued a statement on Sunday evening confirming that federal prosecutors had launched a criminal investigation into the $2.5 billion renovation of the central bank's headquarters in Washington, D.C., and his related testimony to Congress.

Powell, who has come under sustained pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to lower interest rates, said the probe was the result of the president's frustration to cut rates as quickly and as much as he wanted.

""The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,"" Powell said in a video statement tweeted by the Fed's X account.

Powell warned that the outcome of the investigation will determine the future of the central bank's decisions.

""This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions — or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation,"" Powell said.

President Donald Trump's threat of 25% tariffs on countries doing business with Iran has raised the risk of derailing Washington's fragile trade deal with Beijing — Tehran's largest trading partner. 

Trump said Monday night stateside that the U.S. will start charging a 25% tariff on imports from countries that do business with Iran. The order is ""effective immediately,"" he said in a Truth Social post.   

The world's top two economies had secured an interim trade deal in late October that saw a roll back of punitive U.S. tariffs on China, while Beijing paused its sweeping rare earth export controls.

In response to Trump's tariff threat China said it ""firmly opposes any illicit unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction,"" while warning that it would take ""all necessary measures"" to defend its interests, according to a post on X by a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in the U.S.

If Trump is serious about the 25% rate, ""that is a massive escalation from current tariff levels,"" said Deborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation. 

She warned the situation could easily spiral into fresh rounds of tit-for-tat escalation, not to mention dashing any hopes of U.S. soybean exports to China. ""The last time we played this game, we ended up with tariff levels at 145%.""    

As the world's largest importer of oil, Beijing has long bought crude from Iran — and other countries sanctioned by the U.S. — offering a crucial economic lifeline to the Middle Eastern regime reeling from Western curbs. 

Iranian crude oil shipments to China more than doubled between 2017 and 2024 on a per-day basis to over 1.2 million barrels, according to estimates by Muyu Xu, senior analyst at commodity intelligence firm Kpler. 

As of 2022, fuel accounted for more than half of China's imports from Iran, according to World Bank's latest data. 

However, China has since stepped back its trade amid tighter U.S. sanctions. Imports from Iran were on track for a fourth-straight year of decline in 2025, falling 28% in the January to November period from a year earlier, according to official data compiled by Wind Information. China is expected to release full-year trade data on Wednesday.

Beijing will not reduce its economic cooperation with Iran due to Trump's tariff threat, Cui Shoujun, an international studies professor at Renmin University of China, told reporters Tuesday morning. 

""The Iran situation has certainly entered a very dangerous period. We should all pay closer attention,"" Cui said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. He attributed Trump's interest in Iran to energy resources — more oil production than Venezuela, just when U.S. electricity demand is surging in order to power AI. 

While Cui declined to directly address the implications for U.S.-China relations, he said that in-person meetings are an important indicator.

After Trump met Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea last fall, the two sides agreed to a 1-year trade truce. Tariffs on Chinese exports to the U.S. were set to stay around 47.5%, down from a high of more than 100% during the peak of trade tensions in the spring. 

The U.S. president is expected to visit Beijing in April, followed by a reciprocal visit by Xi later in the year. 

""Trump is eroding the thin trust build around [the] trade truce,"" said Dan Wang, China director at Eurasia Group. ""Trump was already widely viewed by Chinese public and government as inconsistent."" 

The U.S. and China have had a history of piling on pressure to build leverage ahead of major diplomatic meetings. Tensions had escalated sharply ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting in October, with Beijing expanding export controls on rare earths and launching anti-trust probes into U.S. chip maker Qualcomm, while Washington reportedly planned to curb chip-design software to China. 

""There will likely be several rounds of similar tit-for-tat, leading up to April meeting,"" said Wang.    

Wang said China could respond with sanctions on U.S. firms tied to Taiwan arms sales, or antitrust probes of American tech firms operating in China, while ruling out additional rare earths restrictions.

It remains to be seen to what extent the tariffs materialize. The U.S. Supreme Court could make a ruling Wednesday on the legality of Trump's use of duties.

The threat of tariffs on Iran's trading partners appeared to be driven by Trump's ""ever shifting focus of attention, not as part of an intentional strategy to gain new leverage over China in advance of the likely April summit,"" said Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.   

Still, ""China will not hesitate to retaliate in a way that imposes serious costs on the U.S. [and it] has prepared for a variety of scenarios, including this one,"" Kennedy added.

BEIJING — An Alibaba-backed startup is pushing artificial intelligence toward real-time, interactive video creation.

PixVerse on Tuesday released an AI tool that allows users to control how a video unfolds while it is being generated. And just like a movie director, users can instruct characters to cry, dance or pose, with actions occurring instantly as the video continues.

Real-time AI video generation can create ""new business models,"" co-founder Jaden Xie told CNBC in an interview translated from Chinese. The possibilities, he said, include a world where users could influence how a micro-drama unfolds, or play an ""infinite"" video game that's not constrained by pre-designed storylines.

Founded in 2023, PixVerse raised more than $60 million in the fall, with Alibaba leading the round and participation from Antler.

Xie said the company is close to completing another funding round, without disclosing the amount. More than half of the participating investors are from overseas, he said.

PixVerse's latest AI tool highlights how China-based teams are giving their competitors a run for their money in AI-generated video tools.

Except for Israeli startup Lightricks, the top eight AI video generation models tracked by AI benchmarking firm Artificial Analysis are Chinese companies. Many offer faster generation speeds and far lower usage fees than OpenAI's advanced, premium AI video model, Sora 2 Pro.

OpenAI's Sora first drew global attention nearly two years ago when it showed off a new text-to-video generation model, but it was not publicly available until December 2024. By then, several Chinese teams had already released competing tools to users globally.

""Sora still defines the quality ceiling in video generation, but it is constrained by generation time and API cost,"" said Wei Sun, a principal analyst at market research firm Counterpoint, referring to the way users are charged for access to use AI models.

""Chinese players are taking a different path. They are turning video generation into a scalable, low-cost, high-throughput production tool."" 

Just last month, Beijing-based startup Shengshu said its TurboDiffusion video framework, developed with researchers from Tsinghua University, could create videos 100 to 200 times faster with minimal quality loss.

PixVerse's latest AI tool has removed most of the waiting time — and aims to be more than just a special effect. Its tools are embedded within the company's social media-style sharing platform, which surpassed 16 million monthly active users in October.

Real-time video generation eliminates the gap between content creation and distribution, Xie said, reshaping how users interact with AI-generated content.

Xie aims to reach 200 million registered users in the first half of this year, up from 100 million in August, and roughly double the team to nearly 200 employees by year's end.

PixVerse primarily serves users outside China through a web-browser interface and smartphone app.

Compared to China-made AI video tools, ""most of the U.S. products are relatively simplistic and minimal"" in user interface and experience, said Alyssa Lee, chief of staff at DataHub and a former vice president at Bessemer Venture Partners. 

Lee said scenario-specific AI video tools offer clearer monetization paths and pointed to Adobe as a traditional software provider facing pressure. Adobe, long a standard for video and design software, has seen its stock stagnate in recent months, she said, suggesting its ""all-in-one creative suite is vulnerable to being unbundled by all these creative AI marketing tools.""

PixVerse estimated annual recurring revenue of $40 million in  October.

It's not the only one generating revenue.

Kling, an AI video tool developed by TikTok rival Kuaishou, posted nearly $100 million in revenue in the first three quarters of 2025, based on CNBC calculations from public disclosures. 

For now, Xie said that PixVerse is prioritizing technology development over commercialization and claimed the company has sufficient funding to operate for a decade.

Addressing concerns about low-quality AI-generated content, often referred to as ""slop,"" Xie compared the current stage of development to the early years of computer graphics, arguing that quality improves as technology matures.

""At the beginning, there will be good and bad [content], but gradually the fittest will surely survive ... and then some people will improve the technology, and truly meet human needs for emotional and spiritual value.""

In this article

JPMorgan Chase on Tuesday posted fourth-quarter results that topped expectations on better-than-expected revenue from the bank's trading operations. 

Here's what the company reported:

The company said profit fell 7% to $13.03 billion, or $4.63 per share, because of a preannounced $2.2 billion reserve tied to its takeover of the Apple Card loan portfolio from Goldman Sachs. Excluding the 60 cent per share hit from that transaction, adjusted earnings came in at $5.23 and topped analysts' expectations.

Companywide revenue rose 7% to $46.77 billion as net interest income also climbed by 7% to $25.1 billion, roughly matching analyst expectations for NII, according to StreetAccount. 

Equities trading revenue surged 40% to $2.9 billion, about $350 million more than analysts had expected, as the company cited strength across operations, especially in its business catering to hedge funds. Fixed income trading revenue rose 7% to $5.4 billion, about $110 million more than expected, according to StreetAccount.

Investment banking, however, appeared to disappoint, as fees fell 5% to $2.3 billion, roughly $210 million below the StreetAccount estimate. 

Shares of the bank were down 3% in morning trading. 

Banks have enjoyed a Goldilocks-type environment for the last few quarters, with a rebound in Wall Street trading, falling interest rates, stable consumer credit and deregulation providing a lift for the sector. High stock levels have also buoyed banks' wealth management divisions.

The KBW Bank Index climbed 29% last year, the second year in a row that the big bank benchmark exceeded the gains of the S&P 500.

In remarks in the earnings release, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the U.S. economy resilient.

""While labor markets have softened, conditions do not appear to be worsening. Meanwhile, consumers continue to spend, and businesses generally remain healthy,"" Dimon said.

""These conditions could persist for some time, particularly with ongoing fiscal stimulus, the benefits of deregulation and the Fed's recent monetary policy,"" he said. ""However, as usual, we remain vigilant, and markets seem to underappreciate the potential hazards—including from complex geopolitical conditions, the risk of sticky inflation and elevated asset prices.""

The bank said it expects full-year 2026 net interest income of about $103 billion and adjusted expenses of roughly $105 billion, though both measures are ""market dependent.""

Analysts will be keen to hear how much banking momentum from 2025 is expected to carry over into this year. Of particular concern is whether there are any cracks in spending amid signs that the labor market may be weakening, as well as guidance around the strength of Wall Street deal-making. 

Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo are scheduled to report results Wednesday, with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley reporting Thursday.

Many are hoping that the bill working its way through the Senate will mark “the beginning of the end of crypto's regulatory limbo.”

The lower-than-expected CPI print and optimism around the amended Digital Asset Market Clarity Act seem to be buoying bitcoin this morning. Meanwhile, bitcoin ETFs started the week with modest inflows ($116.7 million), according to SoSoValue.

Timothy Misir, head of research at Blockhead Research Network, said that on-chain metrics suggest bitcoin is transitioning “out of its most stressed phase.”

“Price now sits above the Active Investors Mean ($87.7K) but remains well below the Short-Term Holder cost basis at $98.9K. This configuration implies reduced forced selling pressure, but also highlights the scale of overhead supply that must be absorbed for a sustained breakout,” Misir said.

One potential headwind for bitcoin is the trajectory of the probe of Fed Chair Jerome Powell, a situation Farzam Ehsani, CEO of VALR, called “paradoxical.”

While weakening confidence in dollar policy traditionally increases interest in decentralized assets as a hedge against political and currency risk, abrupt political maneuvers within the government are increasing instability, triggering short-term outflows from risky assets and high-volatility markets, Ehsani said.He said investors should exercise “extreme caution” in the coming weeks, as the crypto market could react sharply to the conflict's outcome.

“If the Fed holds firm, the market could return to its fundamental scenario. If the White House is able to push through a rate cut and launches stimulus measures, bitcoin and gold could surge higher,” Ehsani said.

Finally, “this week may mark the beginning of the end of crypto's regulatory limbo,” Benchmark analysts wrote in a note, as the Senate committee will vote on Thursday on the amended Digital Asset Market Clarity Act. 

“We believe a successful committee process culminating in floor consideration would represent a material de-risking event for crypto markets,” the analysts wrote. “That regulatory clarity is the key prerequisite for institutional adoption of both crypto tokens and crypto-related equities. In our view, such clarity would unlock a level of liquidity that only institutions could provide, and liquidity is the foundation upon which sustainable crypto valuations are built.”

Some are pessimistic that the bill will move forward. Nic Puckrin, cofounder of Coin Bureau, said he is “not holding his breath” for the bill to pass this month.

“I wouldn't be surprised to see further delays as committee members grapple with the implications of the proposed amendments. And any delays will weigh heavily on a digital asset market that has struggled with momentum for months,” Puckrin said.

The investment bank thinks the prospects for ethereum have improved, citing BitMine's continued buying, stablecoin adoption, the plan to increase the network's throughput, and the passage of crypto-focused legislation. 

The firm expects bitcoin to hit a new all-time high in the first half of the year, and predicts the asset will hit $500,000 in 2030.

Transaction fees, which are paid in the network's native token and also burned, have reached record levels.

Bitcoin ETFs have seen over $1.1 billion leave the funds in the past three days, but the worst may be over, JPMorgan analysts say.

World Liberty Financial's token, WLFI, is the top cryptocurrency gainer in the last 24 hours, peaking at a three-month high of 18.5 cents after the Donald Trump-backed crypto firm announced that a proposed entity has applied for a US banking charter. 

According to a press release, World Liberty Trust Company filed a de novo application with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a branch of the US Treasury Department tasked with supervising and regulating national banks. 

With a national trust bank charter, World Liberty Trust can issue USD1, the dollar-backed stablecoin rolled out by World Liberty Financial last year. The trust company also plans to offer digital asset custody and stablecoin conversion services. 

Even though World Liberty Financial and World Liberty Trust Company share similar branding and names, the ownership and operating structures are different, a statement provided to CoinDesk explained. President Trump is labeled as World Liberty Financial's cofounder emeritus, while his three sons, Eric, Donald Jr., and Barron, are cited as cofounders. 

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency under the Trump administration has already approved bank charter applications from several firms, including Circle Internet Group, Ripple, and BitGo, which maintains all reserve assets backing USD1.

Blockchain data showed that BlackRock deposited 3,743 Bitcoin and 7,204 Ethereum into Coinbase Prime, a platform typically used by institutional clients.

At current market prices, the Bitcoin transfer alone is worth about $339 million, while the Ethereum deposit is valued at roughly $22 million.

According to Lookonchain,  the transfers were made from wallets associated with BlackRock's spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

Large inflows to exchanges have historically heightened short-term volatility, as they raise the possibility of supply entering the market.

While deposits to Coinbase Prime do not always indicate an imminent sale, they are moves closely watched by traders, as they can sometimes be a prelude to a larger action.

BlackRock has not commented publicly on the transfers.

Reaction on X was swift, with traders split between alarm and skepticism.

One user wrote that the move was “really scary,” adding that it “looks like something massive is coming.”

Prime deposits don't always mean selling.Rebalancing or something bigger about to hit the market?

— DEMON (@demontraderr) January 12, 2026 



Another said the transfer “may mean nothing, but usually signals something big.”

A third X user noted that deposits to Coinbase Prime “don't always mean selling.”

They questioned whether the move reflected rebalancing or “something bigger about to hit the market.”

In an interview with CNBC, BlackRock's head of ETFs Jay Jacobs said Bitcoin ETF's are still “early” in their life span, despite being housed in the firm for two years.

“It's still so early,” Jacobs told the broadcaster.

“Many investors have still just been starting their educational journey around what is Bitcoin, and how might it fit in a portfolio .… We see this still being very early days for Bitcoin and Ethereum.”

BlackRock manages the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) and the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA).

IBIT has fallen over 3% over the past year, coinciding with a fall from Bitcoin's highs in October.

“For many financial advisors, maybe they didn't have access to crypto before, or weren't able to buy IBIT before it was approved on their platforms,” Jacobs said.

At the time of reporting , Bitcoin was trading at around $92,000.

In a recent report, CCN analyst Victor Olanrewaju said the price was stuck in a “broad consolidation range.”

“Looking at the technical picture again, the daily chart shows BTC has been stuck in a broad consolidation range since November, trading between $85,592 and $93,681,” he said.

Because the price continues to bounce within that band, Bitcoin “still lacks a clear directional bias,” he added.

Momentum also appears to be weakening, with BTC hovering near the 20-day exponential moving average after already falling below the 50-day EMA — a signal that short- and mid-term trend strength is fading.

“As a result, Bitcoin's price is more likely to fluctuate sideways than break out,” he wrote, suggesting the recent rebound could prove to be a “dead cat bounce” until fresh liquidity enters the market.

Bitcoin BTCUSD eyed one-week highs at Tuesday's Wall Street open as markets surged on low US inflation data.

Key points:

Bitcoin approaches $93,000 and a “huge” resistance wall on the back of positive US inflation trends.

The S&P 500 beats records despite the ongoing spat between US President Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

A trader calls time on the low-timeframe Bitcoin trading range.

Bitcoin gets US inflation boost as S&P 500 surges

Data from TradingView showed 1.5% BTC price gains accompanying cooler-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures for December 2025. 

CPI matched 2.7% predictions, while core CPI came in at 2.6%, 0.1% below the anticipated level, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) confirmed. 

“The all items index rose 2.7 percent for the 12 months ending December, the same increase as over the 12 months ending November,” it wrote in an official statement. 

Reacting, US stock markets immediately gained, with the S&P 500 hitting new all-time highs. 

BREAKING: S&P 500 futures surge above 6,990, a new record high, as Core CPI inflation comes in below expectations.

We may finally see 7,000 today. pic.twitter.com/hTiwnBn8Yj

“Both headline and core CPI inflation were FLAT in December,” trading resource The Kobeissi Letter responded on X.

Kobeissi touched on a problematic situation between the US government and the Federal Reserve. As Cointelegraph reported, the Fed is expected to keep interest rates at current levels at its next meeting on Jan. 28. 

At the same time, President Donald Trump continues to demand that rates drop further. A legal investigation into Powell announced in recent days has become a symbol of that tension, with Powell himself publicly suggesting that it came as a result of Fed policy.

After CPI, Trump reiterated his request for lower rates — something that would notionally have a positive impact on liquidity flowing into risk assets and crypto. 

Trump alluded to US trade tariffs helping bring inflation lower — a source of contention in itself, with the Supreme Court due to decide on the tariffs' legality this week.

BTC price range “won't last much longer”

As Bitcoin eyed $93,000, traders were thus under no illusion about the buying power required to propel the price into a sustained uptrend.

Commentator Exitpump showed two volume-weighted average price (VWAP) trendlines coming into view as a “huge resistance area.”

VWAP refers to an average price point over a period of time, weighted by the amount of trade volume seen.

“The chop from the past few days has made it so there's some decent liquidity built up on both sides,” trader Daan Crypto Trades continued earlier on the day. 

 

Exchange order-book liquidity from monitoring resource CoinGlass put 24-hour cross-crypto liquidations at nearly $170 million.

“No doubt that this current ~$90K-$92K are which we've been trading in for the past 5 days or so, won't last much longer,” Daan Crypto Trades added.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin failed to join this week's risk-on rally, which pushed major stock indices higher, dropping 2.57% over the last seven days, while the Russell 2000 surged 4.6% and the Nasdaq and S&P 500 posted gains.

Crypto market maker Wintermute noted that altcoins bucked this trend with selective rotation into XRP, SOL, and mid-cap tokens.

Gold and Treasuries gained ground as the dollar softened, while Brent crude futures firmed on geopolitical supply concerns.

However, crypto lagged dramatically, with BTC down 1.94% and ETH falling 3.39%.

Only altcoins like SOL, TRON, and Monero posted gains above 2%, leaving Bitcoin at the bottom of the performance table alongside traditional risk assets that thrived.

According to macro details shared by Jasper De Maere, a Wintermute OTC trader, he explained that Bitcoin rallied from the high-$80,000 range early in the week, briefly touching $94,700 before sellers emerged.

By midweek, the price had slipped below $90,000, printing a low around $89,200 before stabilizing near $91,000.

ETH mirrored this pattern, climbing toward $3,220 early before retreating to $3,080 by week's end.

Wintermute highlighted that “$89–90k is support, $94–95k is resistance,” describing this narrow trading range as worthy of close attention given its duration.

Since late November, BTC has remained trapped between the high-$80,000s and low-$90,000s, and that compression has reached extreme levels.

The 30-day trading range now sits at the 91st percentile, meaning price action has rarely been this narrow.

These periods typically mark consolidation phases where ownership turnover slows, and volatility collapses, though historical data shows BTC has posted positive returns 90 days out in three of four similar compressions.

ETF flows swung dramatically last week, starting with $471 million in inflows on January 2, followed by $697 million on January 5, the strongest single-day print since October.

Then came a sharp reversal with approximately $250 million exiting on Tuesday, $485 million on Wednesday, and $400 million on Thursday.

Over $1.1 billion left Bitcoin ETFs, erasing early gains almost dollar-for-dollar, while ETH products bled around $260 million alongside.

Jasper told investors the outflows “didn't feel like distribution though,” noting there was no panic and volumes stayed healthy as fast money simply booked profits and stepped aside.

Meanwhile, altcoins caught a selective bid as XRP, SOL, and DOGE ETFs pulled in approximately $100 million combined while majors faced redemptions.

Wintermute cautioned that while some alt performance emerged, it felt “selective and concentrated in names with ETF flows or their own catalysts,” with consensus still holding that “BTC needs to lead before risk moves down the curve.”

Wednesday's CPI print, expected at 2.7%, and Fed commentary on steadying interest rates are some of the catalysts that could see the market see some improvements this week.

Wintermute concluded that “this phase is more consolidation than distribution” as the U.S. Senate Banking Committee prepares to mark up the CLARITY Act on January 15.

While prices remain relatively stable, on-chain data from XWIN Research Japan already suggests a shift in market behavior as Bitcoin flows into exchanges have remained limited ahead of the bill discussions.

This shows that “market participants are not treating the legislative process as an immediate risk event requiring de-risking.”

SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio), which measures whether moved coins are sold at a profit or loss, is hovering around or slightly below 1.

This means that profit-taking is subdued and on-chain spending itself is low; Bitcoin simply is not being moved.

Together, these indicators point to a market that is not defensive but patient, with investors appearing to hold Bitcoin while waiting for regulatory clarity.

Key Takeaways

The U.S. Senate Banking Committee's draft version of the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act could mark a turning point for how major cryptocurrencies are regulated in the U.S.

While Bitcoin has long enjoyed regulatory clarity as a commodity, the bill outlines a framework that may extend similar treatment to other large-cap tokens such as XRP, Solana (SOL), Hedera (HBAR), Chainlink (LINK), and Dogecoin (DOGE). This shift could meaningfully reshape the outlook for spot altcoin ETFs.

At the core of the proposal is a clear legal distinction between digital commodities and securities, paired with a presumption that sufficiently decentralized network tokens should not be regulated as investment contracts.

This approach directly addresses years of regulatory uncertainty that have held back institutional adoption and product development.

The draft legislation introduces a formal definition of a “network token.”

Section 4B(a)(6) defines  a network token as a digital commodity intrinsically linked to a distributed ledger system and states that such tokens are treated as non-securities under federal securities laws. This mirrors Bitcoin's long-standing treatment as a commodity rather than a security.

Crucially, network tokens are explicitly treated as non-securities for purposes of federal securities laws, provided they do not grant holders traditional financial rights such as equity, debt claims, dividends, or liquidation preferences.

This definition closely aligns with how regulators currently perceive Bitcoin. Bitcoin derives its value from network usage, security, and adoption, rather than from the managerial efforts of a centralized issuer. Under the bill, tokens that operate similarly can fall outside the SEC's securities regime, even if a founding entity initially distributed them.

This framework is asset-agnostic. If XRP, SOL, HBAR, LINK, or DOGE meet the decentralization and functional criteria, they qualify for the same non-security status Bitcoin enjoys.

For assets such as XRP, SOL, HBAR, LINK, and DOGE, this represents a critical shift. Each powers a live blockchain network with broad participation, transaction utility, and decentralized governance elements. The bill acknowledges that value appreciation driven by network activity or decentralized governance does not, by itself, make a token a security.

One of the most significant aspects of the draft bill is its approach to decentralization and “common control.”

Section 4B(b)(2) provides that secondary market sales of network tokens do not constitute securities transactions, so long as they are not part of an investment contract tied to an issuer's ongoing efforts. This is critical: it removes the legal overhang that has historically blocked spot ETF approvals for many altcoins. Bitcoin already benefits from this clarity; this section extends it to qualifying network tokens broadly.

The legislation directs the SEC to establish criteria and safe harbors for determining when a distributed ledger system is no longer under the common control of related persons.

Once a network is certified as not subject to common control, its associated token benefits from strong legal presumptions:

This framework is particularly relevant for XRP and Solana, both of which have faced scrutiny over whether early development teams retained excessive influence.

The bill establishes a formal, transparent pathway for regulators to recognize when networks mature beyond issuer dependence, a feature that has been largely absent from prior enforcement-driven approaches.

A newly highlighted section of proposed digital asset legislation introduces a meaningful regulatory classification for certain crypto tokens, designating them as “non-ancillary assets” based on their inclusion in exchange-traded products (ETPs) as of Jan. 1, 2026.

Under the provision, a token will not be required to file the additional disclosures imposed on other digital assets if it meets a specific criterion: it must be the primary underlying asset of an ETF or ETP listed on a national securities exchange and registered under Section 6 of the Securities Exchange Act  as of the cutoff date.

As drafted, the rule would classify some tokens as non-ancillary assets from day one. For example:

🚨NEW: Here's an interesting section giving some tokens classification as non-ancillary assets based on their inclusion in exchange-traded products as of January 1, 2026.

— Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) January 13, 2026 



Why it matters:

Broader implications:

Overall, the provision reflects a pragmatic approach by lawmakers: rather than re-examining the status of widely traded, exchange-listed crypto assets, it treats ETP inclusion as sufficient evidence of non-ancillary status, effectively expanding Bitcoin- and Ethereum-like treatment to a broader set of tokens under U.S. securities law .

ETF issuers have consistently pointed to regulatory ambiguity as the primary barrier to launching spot products tied to non-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies. The Clarity Act directly addresses that issue by providing statutory recognition that many widely traded tokens are digital commodities, not securities.

For the SEC, this distinction is foundational. Spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved only after regulators accepted that Bitcoin markets fall under a commodity framework with oversight by the CFTC. By extending similar treatment to other decentralized network tokens, the bill lays the legal groundwork for:

Notably, the bill also includes explicit exemptions and waivers for exchange-traded products and passive investment vehicles, allowing them to operate without triggering insider resale restrictions that apply to token insiders.

This provision appears tailored to accommodate ETFs and similar institutional products.

Another significant implication for ETF viability is the bill's treatment of secondary market transactions. Under the draft, the law explicitly doesn't consider the resale of a network token by non-originators a securities transaction. This even if the token arrived initially through an investment contract.

This is a direct response to concerns raised in past enforcement actions, where regulators blurred the line between primary issuance and secondary trading.

By separating the two, the legislation provides a clearer legal basis for exchanges, market makers, and ETF issuers to support liquidity without inheriting issuer-level regulatory risk.

For large-cap altcoins with deep global markets, this clarity could accelerate institutional participation and deepen U.S.-based liquidity, key prerequisites for ETF approval.

While the bill does not guarantee ETF approvals, it materially improves the odds. Regulatory clarity tends to reduce risk premiums, attract institutional capital, and support product innovation.

If enacted, the framework would likely:

That said, implementation details will matter. The SEC retains authority to define decentralization thresholds, enforce anti-fraud rules, and oversee disclosure during transitional periods.

Markets should not expect immediate approvals, but the structural barriers are clearly going to be lower.

More broadly, the Senate Banking Committee's draft signals a philosophical shift away from regulating crypto primarily through enforcement actions. Instead, it adopts a rules-based, technology-neutral framework that acknowledges how decentralized networks actually operate.

By placing XRP, SOL, HBAR, LINK, DOGE, and similar assets on a regulatory footing closer to Bitcoin, the bill acknowledges that the crypto market has evolved beyond a binary “security vs. non-security” debate. For investors, developers, and ETF issuers alike, that shift could prove transformative.

If passed, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act may be remembered not just as a regulatory cleanup but also as a landmark piece of legislation.

Still, as the moment U.S. policy finally caught up with the realities of modern blockchain networks, it opened the door to the next generation of crypto investment products.

It is a draft version of the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which aims to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets by clearly distinguishing securities from digital commodities.

Large-cap tokens such as XRP, Solana (SOL), Hedera (HBAR), Chainlink (LINK), and Dogecoin (DOGE) could benefit if they qualify as decentralized “network tokens” under the bill's definitions.

The bill does not explicitly name specific tokens. Still, it creates a legal category for decentralized network tokens that would be treated as digital commodities rather than securities, similar to Bitcoin.

Large technology partnerships often look procedural: paperwork, coordination, and timelines that stretch further than a news cycle. That's part of why Saudi Arabia's agreement between WhiteBIT and Durrah AIFodah is easy to underestimate at first glance, even though the scope suggests something more structured is taking shape.

WhiteBIT is a major European cryptocurrency exchange, and the partnership ties its technical expertise to Saudi Arabia's Vision 20230 priorities through Durrah AIFodah Holding. The agreement focuses on blockchain infrastructure, digital finance, and national-scale data systems. These are all areas that Saudi Arabia has been steadily building out. Seaside Arabia facilitated the cooperation, acting as a strategic consultant throughout the process and helping mold how the partnership would operate inside Saudi regulatory and market frameworks. 

When Digital Systems Become National Assets

Saudi Arabia's interest in blockchain shows up as infrastructure planning. National data computing centers, blockchain processing capacity, and sovereign digital currency research all point toward the same concern: control over systems that increasingly underpin economic activity. 

Under the agreement, WhiteBIT provides infrastructure design and technical guidance, while Durrah AIFodah supports market entry, regulatory coordination, and local partnerships. The balance is important, given that technical capability alone doesn't move national projects forward, and neither does access without systems that grow responsibly. This collaboration meets in the middle of the overlap. 

Digital Currency and Regional Positioning

Central Bank Digital Currency development is one of the more closely watched components of the agreement. A CBDC framework has implications beyond domestic use. This is particularly important in regions where cross-border settlement standards are still forming.

Sure, some companies isolate their digital currency research, but the partnership places it alongside broader financial infrastructure work. That context suggests a long-term approach, where digital money is treated as part of a system.

Private Sector Partnerships as Strategy

The involvement of a European exchange and a Saudi holding company with royal backing reflects how technology partnerships increasingly operate as a form of alignment. While these arrangements don't look like traditional diplomacy, they often carry similar weight. 

They're built through coordination, shared incentives, and practical problem-solving. Over time, they influence how platforms integrate smoothly and which markets open with fewer frictions. 

Vision 2030 in Practice

Vision 2030 often gets discussed at a high level. Agreements like this one make it tangible as digital finance becomes part of economic restructuring. The partnership outlines projects that include stock market tokenization, CBDC framework development, and national data and mining centers. Each of them points back to domestic capacity and long-term resilience. 

Leadership and Framing the Work Ahead

Volodymyr Nosov, Founder and President of W Group, framed the agreement around continuity and responsibility. It's not about disruption. Nosov stated, “It is an honor to work alongside the Holding of His Royal Highness Prince Naif Bin Abdullah Bin Saud to build the foundations of Saudi Arabia's digital transformation. Together, we aim to establish and secure sovereign blockchain systems that will shape the Kingdom's technological future.” 

That emphasis on foundations feels deliberate. The agreement reinforces a shared focus on systems designed to last, adapt, and remain under national oversight. For Saudi Arabia, deals like this are all about preparation. The impact tends to surface gradually, through infrastructure that becomes ordinary.","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","cryptocurrency"

US Senators Cynthia Lummis and Ron Wyden on Monday unveiled the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, bipartisan legislation that would exempt non-custodial blockchain developers and infrastructure providers from federal money transmitter rules.

The bill aims to protect innovation, maintain consistency with federal guidance, and prevent non-custodial developers from being treated like banks or financial intermediaries.

Under the proposal, developers who write software, maintain distributed ledgers, or provide supporting infrastructure, but do not control users' funds, would not be treated as money transmitters under federal law.

“Blockchain developers who have simply written code and maintained open-source infrastructure have lived under the threat of being classified as money transmitters for far too long,” said Lummis, who chairs the Senate Banking Digital Assets Subcommittee.

“This designation makes no sense when they never touch, control, or have access to user funds, and unnecessarily limits innovation,” she said.

Wyden framed the issue in terms of constitutional rights. “Forcing developers who write code to follow the same rules as exchanges or brokers is technologically illiterate and a recipe for violating Americans' privacy and free speech rights,” he said.

The legislation also seeks to harmonize federal standards with state laws while offering regulatory certainty to stimulate the US digital finance sector.

Under current law, many developers face regulatory uncertainty that has driven innovation offshore and subjected them to conflicting state rules.

The legal threshold for developer liability reached a turning point in the recent prosecutions of Tornado Cash and Samourai Wallet. In these cases, prosecutors successfully argued that maintaining and governing code can qualify developers as ‘financial institutions,' making them subject to the Bank Secrecy Act in the same way as traditional banks.

Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm was convicted in 2025 of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, while Samourai Wallet founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill pled guilty to similar charges.

Members of the crypto community argue that these outcomes represent a dangerous precedent, effectively criminalizing the act of publishing privacy-preserving software.

The Michigan Daily


					One hundred and thirty-five years of editorial freedom				

When they were first invented, non-fungible tokens experienced insurmountable hype, with some reaching values of more than $69 million at their absolute peak in 2021. The concept behind NFTs is that they are units of data with proof of ownership that certify a digital asset as unique — essentially an authenticated version of a digital image. Investors trade, buy and sell these digital art pieces much like physical artwork. After a couple years, however, the excitement fizzled out, so their values quickly declined.

Nowadays, NFTs are widely considered a dead trend, unworthy of investment or attention. However, companies like BlackRock and JPMorgan have been experimenting with new uses for the concepts behind NFTs and how they generate revenue, and many businesses and investors are leaning into it. Many recognize this new wave of innovation as NFT 2.0, and it could be the very thing that revives its popularity and everyday financial usages. 

Where the first generation focused almost entirely on trading digital collectibles, the second emphasizes new functionality and integration with real-world systems.

The original NFTs were static, relying on the supply and demand of its type. In the absence of a link to a physical attribution, they were extremely volatile and susceptible to sudden (and deep) troughs and peaks. 

At first, general public participation in trading NFTs was enough to keep it moving and thriving. But eventually, issues began to arise. Oversupply, copycat projects and cryptocurrency downturns deteriorated public confidence. They were also fatally underdeveloped, leading to scams, fraud and market manipulation.

As a result of having no real-world utility beyond speculation, the dip in investment was enough to throw off NFT stability and temporarily curb it as a legitimate asset. In 2023, their average values crashed by 95% and 23 million people were left with worthless investments, leaving a bitter taste in the public's mouth.

This purely speculative nature is a mistake that NFT 2.0 has patched, with its pinnacle of evolution this year. NFT 2.0 emphasizes the practical and tangible uses of NFTs in everyday life.

For example, developers improved blockchain, the foundational ledger system behind NFT transaction verifications. In recent years, blockchain mechanisms adopted Layer 2 solutions. Layer 2 solutions are secondary frameworks that improve the performance, speed and cost-effectiveness of the transaction-verification system — a principal function of non-fungible tokens. Since blockchain is so heavily integrated into NFT systems, its advancement consequently ameliorates NFTs as well. 

Layer 2 solutions make NFTs secure enough to apply to more practical tasks. In fact, startups like Propy and Roofstock, both NFT real-estate companies, have embraced NFT 2.0 by tokenizing property deeds to accelerate transactions and verify ownership on-chain. By and large, more companies are implementing NFTs to enhance consumer experience, ultimately bolstering consumer confidence and NFTs popularity in the market.

Within the realm of the asset's original uses, NFT 2.0 also offers more robust investment options than before. Throughout NFT 1.0, the main objective of investors was to “flip” an acquired NFT — purchasing a digital token, waiting for the value to increase and selling it, ultimately making money off of the value fluctuation. But this eventually became very monotonous and, as such, was not economically set to last very long.

Now, NFT consumers can invest based on NFT project fundamentals, smart contract verifications and creator track records. The new multifunctionality of the digital assets presents benefits to everyday consumers as well as direct investors. 

In 2023, the Internal Revenue Service classified the transfer of NFTs as digital assets or property, instead of currency. Because long-term holdings have lower tax rates, it encourages patient investment over speculation. The more complex and legitimate forms of NFT investments suggest a more promising long-term involvement and returns.

There are still valid concerns that, at their core, NFTs are unreliable, and the high volatility still presents risk to investors. However, there has been a paradigm shift in consumer trust of these digital tokens due to improvements made between NFT 1.0 and NFT 2.0, which is a determining factor in the reliability, stability and legitimacy of NFTs. Since the crash in 2023, investors have begun treating NFTs as startups rather than collectibles. This means that they were no longer valued solely based on novelty, but also long-term utility and potential, ultimately preventing overspeculation. NFT integration into well-established corporations also provides the investment with an outbound link to stability. The technology has strong ties to blue-chip companies, like BMW and Yves Saint Laurent, so legitimacy is both preserved and insulated. Investing in NFTs through these companies can reduce the risk of unforeseen value crashes. 

The NFT 2.0 wave of innovation has demonstrated that the sector is prepared for a second life built upon the foundation of real utility and credibility, unlike before. While directly investing may still be risky, embracing the shift in small steps can both acclimate and benefit a consumer.

NFT Paris' cancellation highlights pressure on sponsorship budgets rather than just falling NFT prices.

NFT activity continues in 2026, but volumes are lower, and demand is more price-sensitive.

Conference economics often reveal market health in ways sales charts cannot.

NFT usage is shifting toward utility and infrastructure, while hype-driven formats are fading.

NFT Paris, one of Europe's better-known non-fungible token (NFT) gatherings, was abruptly called off for 2026, alongside its sister event, RWA Paris, roughly a month before it was due to run.

A conference cancellation does not measure the NFT market in the same way a sales chart does, but it can reveal something else: whether there is still enough demand, sponsorship budget and industry momentum to keep large-scale NFT events economically viable.

With NFT trading activity and valuations widely reported to be down from prior peaks, NFT Paris' decision offers a useful signal of what “the NFT market” looks like heading into 2026.

Did you know? NFT Paris was positioned as one of Europe's flagship NFT conferences, bringing together artists, marketplaces, brands and Web3 startups for panels, exhibitions and deal-making.

What exactly got canceled?

NFT Paris and the adjacent RWA Paris event were billed as a Feb. 5-6 gathering at the Grande Halle de la Villette before organizers pulled the plug with roughly a month's notice.

In the organizers' statement, the team said the “market collapse hit us hard,” “drastic cost cuts” still were not enough, and all tickets would be refunded within 15 days.

The bigger question is what happened around the event's funding. Some sponsors said they would not receive refunds, even as the event reiterated its ticket-refund timeline.

Large Web3 conferences typically rely heavily on sponsorships to justify venue, production and programming costs. When that underwriting disappears, it can signal that marketing budgets and the expected returns from NFT-focused visibility have tightened.

Signals from the NFT market heading into 2026

On the money side, aggregated market data has been weak compared to earlier cycles. CryptoSlam's NFT Global Sales Volume index shows $320.2 million in NFT sales volume for November 2025. That figure is down from $629 million in October 2025. December 2025 was $303.5 million.

CoinMarketCap's Academy coverage of the same period described November as the weakest month of 2025 and tied the slowdown to broader pressure across digital collectibles.

But activity has not vanished. DappRadar's reporting on 2025 highlighted a pattern in which sales counts rose even as average prices and headline volumes remained comparatively subdued. In Q3 2025, 18.1 million NFTs were sold, generating $1.6 billion in trading volume. The report also noted that many NFTs were trading at lower values than before.

Taken together, the “state of the NFT market” heading into 2026 looks compressed and price-sensitive: There are plenty of transactions, far less sponsor-friendly hype and liquidity concentrated in fewer places. 

Why a conference cancellation can sometimes say more than a price chart

NFT prices can swing for many reasons. These include incentive programs, thin liquidity or a handful of high-ticket sales that do not reflect the wider market. A conference, by contrast, lives or dies on whether the industry is willing to pay to gather, through ticket demand, exhibitor spending and especially sponsorship budgets.

In the event business, sponsorships and expo revenue are often treated as core pillars. The Professional Convention Management Association (PCMA), for example, points to a “healthy” revenue mix in which a meaningful share comes from registration and a similar share comes from expo and sponsorship.

Trade show analysts also note that many events earn most of their revenue from exhibitors rather than ticket sales.

So, when NFT Paris says the “market collapse hit us hard” despite “drastic cost cuts,” it tells us a lot about the economics surrounding NFTs, not only the assets themselves.

Where NFTs still have traction

Even in a down market, NFTs have not disappeared so much as shifted into narrower, utility-led niches.

One example is ticketing and fan access. Ticketmaster has promoted “token-gated” sales, where holding a specific NFT can unlock presales, upgraded seats or packaged experiences. This positions NFTs as access credentials rather than standalone collectibles.

Coachella's Coachella Keys experiment made the same point. NFTs were sold as lifetime festival access with VIP-style perks, tying ownership to something tangible rather than a resale narrative.

At the same time, several high-profile consumer brands have scaled back or sunset NFT-style loyalty pilots. Starbucks confirmed it would end its Odyssey program on March 31, 2024, framing the move as a step to “prepare for what comes next.”

Reddit has signaled a wind-down of parts of its Collectible Avatars stack, including closing its shop and removing some on-platform functions.

Marketplace consolidation, incentives and the pivot away from “NFT-only”

Another reason a flagship conference can struggle is that the NFT economy it was built around is no longer centered on NFT marketplaces as a standalone category.

OpenSea, for instance, has been publicly repositioning itself beyond its original identity. CEO Devin Finzer has described a shift from being an NFT marketplace toward a broader “trade-everything” model.

At the same time, the trader-led marketplace era, exemplified by Blur, changed how volume is generated. Multiple researchers and analysts have linked parts of the post-2022 NFT volume story to incentive-driven activity, which can boost headline numbers without necessarily reflecting new end-user demand.

Add in regulatory uncertainty around NFTs and major platforms, including the US Securities and Exchange Commission's Wells notice disclosed by OpenSea in 2024, and the result is a market that looks more cautious, more consolidated and less willing to fund large NFT-only moments.

Did you know? Blur is an NFT marketplace built for professional traders. Its use of points and token airdrops helped it briefly dominate NFT trading volume in 2023, an example analysts often cite to show how incentives can inflate activity without signaling broader user demand.

What's next for NFTs?

NFT Paris cancellation can be seen as a snapshot of the market's current economics. It does not, on its own, indicate market terminality.

Against a backdrop in which monthly NFT sales volumes were widely reported to be far below prior highs, the event's failure to pencil out fits a market with less discretionary spending.

Going into 2026, analysts are likely watching three signals:

Whether volumes hold without incentive spikes

Whether brands and sponsors return with measurable product goals

Whether NFTs show up as “invisible infrastructure” inside games, ticketing or loyalty.

If you spent even five minutes looking at how fast NFT prices were crashing back in 2021, you would have seen this coming. But here we are. Steve Aoki, the guy who made throwing cake at people a full-time job, is now dealing with something way less fun: a massive lawsuit.

Based on recent reports, investors are suing him. They claim Aoki's A0K1VERSE project wasn't a “cool club for fans,” but was actually just a “pump and dump” scheme. That's a fancy way of saying they think he hyped it up just to make money and then left everyone else with nothing. NFTs were sketchy from the start. 

For those who weren't paying attention—which was basically everyone—the A0K1VERSE was sold as a “digital world” where buying a “Passport” (an NFT) gave you cool stuff like hoodies, tickets to private parties, and a chance to hang out with Aoki.

Actually, the people suing him say the reality was a total letdown. According to court papers, the value of these NFTs has dropped to almost zero. Some investors claim they spent over $200,000 on these tokens and “credits” that are now about as useful as a broken phone.

The lawsuit says Aoki and his team didn't do what they promised in their “roadmap” (their plan for the project). Specifically, the plaintiffs claim that the “perks”—like special merch and being first in line for new projects—never really happened. They feel like they paid a lot of money for a digital picture that does nothing. Also, the suit claims Aoki used his huge social media following to trick people into thinking the tokens were worth a lot of money, only to stop caring about the project once he got the cash.

Actually, the biggest part of the legal fight is about whether these NFTs were “securities” like a stock. That's a legal word for a specific type of investment. If they are, Aoki had to follow very strict rules that he allegedly ignored. Without those rules, the people who bought the NFTs had no protection when the prices crashed.

While the EDM world is usually all about “PLUR” (Peace, Love, Unity, Respect), the court system is all about “Evidence.” This lawsuit isn't just about Steve Aoki; it's a sign that the whole industry is finally being held responsible. Celebrities who used their fame to sell risky digital stuff are finally being asked to prove they weren't just tricking their fans.

Actually, you shouldn't need a judge to tell you that a digital drawing of an alien isn't a great way to save for the future. But now that the A0K1VERSE is falling apart, fans are getting a very expensive lesson on the difference between “hype” and “real value.”

EDMTunes will keep an eye on this case as it goes to court. But honestly, we should have seen this coming the second we started caring more about JPEGs than the actual music.

Now that the hype surrounding cryptocurrency-backed non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has mostly died down, it's rare that they pop up in the news anymore except as the subject of a lawsuit. That's certainly the case with cake-throwing DJ Steve Aoki, who has been named in a class action lawsuit alleging he used his social media influence to promote NFTs from a now-defunct company without disclosing that he was being paid to do so.

MetaZoo Games, which was initially founded in 2000 to sell a collectible card game, has sold skate gear and clothing as well as NFTs. During the peak of the NFT craze, the company was selling a full set of 10 MetaZoo Coin NFTs for 20 Ethereum, which was worth around $80,000 at the time.

“There is a specific set of rules that are in place to protect consumers, and it's of great importance that influencers know and understand those rules, because they are requirements and not suggestions,” said Berger in a statement to Law.com. “There are a number of class actions now against viable companies where the same thing has happened.”

Aoki became an equity partner in MetaZoo in 2021. The company released a collectible card game series for the DJ's HiROQUEST: Genesis album the following year. That same year, Aoki said he'd made more money from NFTs than he had in a decade of music royalties. MetaZoo filed for bankruptcy in January 2024.

ICO says it is making inquiries with banking group over data privacy after it accessed 30,000 staff accounts

The information watchdog is questioning Lloyds Banking Group over a potential breach of privacy rules after it accessed data from 30,000 staff bank accounts during union pay talks last year.

Lloyds – which owns the Halifax and Bank of Scotland brands – used aggregated salary, spending and savings data as part of a presentation to staff union representatives, which suggested that its lowest-paid staff had been in a better financial position than the wider population in recent years.

The banking group's 65,000 staff are strongly urged to hold their personal account with Lloyds, meaning the lender could access financial information without permission.

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has confirmed it is making “inquiries” with Lloyds over whether it may have breached data privacy rules as a result.

It comes as the bank's chief executive, Charlie Nunn, is lined up for a pay package that could be worth more than £13m, helped by the UK's controversial decision to lift a cap on banker bonuses. The bank's remuneration committee has begun drafting a three-year executive pay policy that will take advantage of looser rules which have sent potential payouts soaring at rival banks.

Initial signs of wrongdoing over staff data could prompt the ICO to launch a full investigation, and the watchdog ultimately has the power to fine the group up to 4% of its annual turnover if it is found guilty of breaching UK rules. That could result in a bill of up to £1.36bn for Lloyds, based on its earnings for 2024.

An ICO spokesperson said: “We are aware of this incident and are making inquiries with Lloyds Banking Group.”

Lloyds, which had been locked in pay negotiations with staff unions, ultimately agreed on a £1,200 pay rise for its lowest-paid staff for each of 2026 and 2027, representing a 7%-9% increase over the two years. That pay agreement was backed by union members.

Accord, one of Lloyds' staff unions, said Lloyds had assured it that the information was fully aggregated, and that no individual information was reviewed by negotiators.

“Understandably, given the confusion and concern, the ICO is looking into what Lloyds Banking Group (LBG) did and whether it broke any data laws,” Accord said.

“We believe this is absolutely right. We need an independent assessment to review what took place and if anything untoward was found to have been done, to ensure it never happens again.”

The ICO carries a number of powers to punish data breaches, including formal reprimands, mandatory audits of data handling, and fines that can be worth up to 4% of a company's annual turnover. Lloyds reported total income of £34bn for 2024, meaning that if the ICO found it to be in breach of UK data laws, it could end up facing a maximum fine of about £1.36bn.

Accord said it reserved the right to sue the banking group if the ICO found it had breached data rules. “If the ICO finds that LBG breached data privacy rules, Accord will not hesitate to escalate the matter legally,” the union said in a member newsletter. “We will hold the employer fully to account as Accord will always put members' interests first.

“Even if the ICO finds that no data privacy rules were breached, LBG needs to learn lessons. Critically, LBG needs to ensure this kind of situation (and the confusion and concern it has caused) is not repeated. Members deserve certainty and respect – and we intend to secure both.”

Lloyds said the banking group was “committed to fair and progressive pay that provides certainty and support for all colleagues, and in this case more junior colleagues”.

A spokesperson said: “We have worked hard with our unions, using aggregated data and direct colleague input and we are pleased that members of our recognised unions have voted to support our competitive multiyear pay proposal for 2026 and 2027 by a significant majority.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","cryptocurrency"

UK Gov Seeks Public Trust with New ICO Data Security Agreement

Following a series of high profile data breaches, the UK government is seeking to rebuild public trust through a new agreement with the data regulator.




                                                                                Elizabeth Greenberg

                                                10.19am


The Information Commissioner's Office has reached a new memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the UK government in an effort to restore public trust after a series of data breaches and incidents within UK government departments.

The ICO says that it has been clear that the government must do more and move faster to improve data security as part of its wider data protection practices.

UK government departments have faced a number of high profile data breaches over the years, including the leak of a database of tens of thousands of Afghans to the public, which compromised their safety.

The UK government has also come under scrutiny for the data breach concerning about 10,000 officers of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Another data leak exposed data concerning about 200 victims of abuse from the Church of England to the public, while the Legal Aid Agency breach saw sensitive data surrounding criminal cases exposed.

The new MoU sets out expectations and responsibilities for both the UK government and the ICO with a goal of building back public trust in their data security.

Both parties have agreed to work collaboratively and transparently to ensure a free flow of information is available to each party.

Within the agreement, the government's responsibilities include publishing annual assurance statements to the public on how their data is being kept safe, as well as carrying out regular assurance exercises within various departments.

The government will turn to the ICO for expert advice as it expands and deepens a data safety culture throughout its various departments, setting out clear goals to track progress.

The MoU holds the government responsible for enacting a privacy and trust by design approach to the use of personal data or new technologies, with guidance from the ICO.

The government will also provide effective oversight through an accountable governance model to the Transformation Board, which will entail risk and audit boards regularly monitoring department-wide data protection risks and tracking progress.

In turn, the ICO will be responsible for working with the government to use insights to inform guidance and resources for departments, provide expert advice on best practice, and regularly visit the government's Transformation Board for review.

“Where standards are not met or maintained, the MOU reinforces the mechanisms available to us to hold government to account and take appropriate action where necessary,” the ICO said in its statement on the MoU.

The new MoU follows the publication of the Information Security Review 2023 in August 2025, which investigated 11 incidents of data breaches within UK government departments. Ministers questioned why the government had yet to only implement 12 of the 14 recommendations outlined in the review.

A new agreement governing the working relationship between the Information Commissioner's Office the government could help restore damaged public trust in the state's use of their data, the regulator has claimed.

The two parties have just unveiled a new memorandum of understanding which clarifies each's “respective roles to protect people's information [and] sets out an enduring framework and approach to co-operation and collaboration”.

The document details a range of underlying principles agreed upon by both government and the ICO, as well outlining actions that each will take – individually and jointly.

The two parties have committed to “work together to ensure the public can see real benefits in sharing their data and trust that it will be protected” and also to “work collaboratively and transparently, taking a ‘no surprises' approach”.

To ensure this cooperation takes place, the ICO and government – which will be represented by the Cabinet Office and the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology – will meet at least once a year “to review the progress and relevance of the MOU”, and will also “jointly provide an update on our work together on a regular basis”.

For its part, government has pledged to “publish an annual assurance statement on how people's data is being kept safe and how new and proposed technologies and processes have been designed with trust and privacy in mind”.

Other clear actions enshrined in the new agreement include the establishment of “a clear process for responding to a personal data breach” – which all civil servants will be asked to follow. Government will also “seek the ICO's expert advice when it has identified that the use of personal data in the delivery of a policy or a system carries a significant risk” and take steps to “ensure that, at all times, there is an accountable and named individual responsible… for managing cross-government data protection risk and compliance” – a responsibility which is currently held by the government chief data officer, Aimee Smith.

Other, less measurable commitments include a promise to focus on “prioritising public trust and confidence in the government's handling of personal data” and to help cultivate “a cross-government culture of continuous learning around improving information security”.

“This includes gathering intelligence and learning lessons from personal data breaches and ‘near misses' and implementing actions that would prevent a future similar breach,” the MOU adds.

Government also plans to “raise awareness of civil servants on how to share data safely… and inform [them] of the real-world consequences of inadvertent personal data breaches”.

All of Whitehall's commitments will be supported by efforts to “track key indicators that monitor civil service maturity and awareness of information management”.

‘Trends and risks'In fulfilling its part of the deal, the ICO vows to “use its expertise and resources” to assist with government's efforts to train civil servants on issues of data security, as well as supporting the creation of the new blueprint for responding to a data breach.

The data watchdog also promises to “use its intelligence, including from breach reports and contact with the ICO advice services, to identify trends and potential risks and share their insights and trends with government to take action”.

Another pledge contained in the MOU is to “provide regulatory certainty by producing timely and relevant products including guidance, codes of practice, advice notes, opinions and audits that support government and the public sector to use people's data safely”.

When there is an incident to which the regulator needs to respond, the ICO says that it will “be transparent with the public when holding an organisation to account for a breach”.

Other commitments set out in the arrangement include a stipulation that the data regulator will “provide independent and expert advice in response to government raising a substantial risk” and, finally, that it “will recognise that senior responsible officers in DSIT and Cabinet Office are responsible for driving collaboration between departments and… will work with both officers to support that”.

Following the publication of the MOU – which was undersigned by security minister Dan Jarvis, digital government minister Ian Murray, and information commissioner John Edwards – the ICO issued a statement claiming that the new arrangement has come in light of “several serious, high-profile data breaches that undermined public trust in government, some of which also placed lives at risk”.

“We have been clear that government needs to do more and move faster to improve data security as part of wider data protection practices, and we welcomed the government's commitments to the chair of the Science, Innovation and Technology Committee in 2025,” the ICO added. “This MOU formalises that action, setting clear expectations and a pathway for government to address concerns about its approach to data protection, rebuild trust with the public and improve transparency and accountability in how government departments treat and handle people's personal information.  This MOU is further strengthened by the leadership of the government chief data officer and expert network of departmental data protection officers who play a vital role in embedding good data practice and culture across government.”

The company is due to acquire cryptocurrency exchange Coinme and crypto wallet infrastructure provider Sequence for more than $250 million, Polygon said in a Tuesday (Jan. 13) press release provided to PYMNTS.

The deal is designed to deliver three chief components of the Polygon Open Money Stack, “including physical cash and digital fiat on- and off-ramps, wallet infrastructure, and cross-chain orchestration through intents,” the company said in the release.

“Stablecoins are increasingly being used as a settlement layer for global payments, but the infrastructure around them remains fragmented,” Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron said in the release. “These acquisitions give us regulated access to U.S. payment rails, wallet infrastructure and cross-chain intents capabilities to build an open payments business on top of on-chain settlement.”

Founded in 2014 as one of the first licensed digital currency exchanges in the United States, Coinme offers Polygon money-transmitter licenses and compliance infrastructure that allow operations in 48 states. The company also offers a “regulated white-label crypto-as-a-service offering” for FinTechs, enterprises and payment applications, according to the release.

Sequence adds smart wallets and a “one-click, cross-chain orchestration and intents engine” aimed at simplifying crypto payment flows across networks, “without requiring users to manage bridging, swaps or gas,” the release said.

Along with Polygon, the businesses have processed more than $1 billion in off-chain sales and over $2 trillion of on-chain value transfers, per the release.

The acquisition comes as stablecoins are increasingly being pushed into the financial mainstream.

“The stablecoin pitch has always been a digital token that maintains a stable value, usually pegged to a fiat currency, while inheriting the speed, programmability and global reach of blockchains,” PYMNTS reported Friday (Jan. 9). “What that pitch can leave out, however, is everything that makes money usable at scale. That includes compliance, consumer protection, liquidity management, accounting standards and integration with existing payment rails.”

The gap is now closing, as evidenced by developments from the banking sector, the report said. Last week, Digital Asset and Kinexys by J.P. Morgan announced a collaboration bringing Kinexys products to Digital Asset's Canton Network, a privacy-enabled blockchain network for synchronized financial markets. Also last week, Barclays announced it bought a stake in Ubyx, a U.S. stablecoin settlement company.

Large technology partnerships often look procedural: paperwork, coordination, and timelines that stretch further than a news cycle. That's part of why Saudi Arabia's agreement between WhiteBIT and Durrah AIFodah is easy to underestimate at first glance, even though the scope suggests something more structured is taking shape.

WhiteBIT is a major European cryptocurrency exchange, and the partnership ties its technical expertise to Saudi Arabia's Vision 20230 priorities through Durrah AIFodah Holding. The agreement focuses on blockchain infrastructure, digital finance, and national-scale data systems. These are all areas that Saudi Arabia has been steadily building out. Seaside Arabia facilitated the cooperation, acting as a strategic consultant throughout the process and helping mold how the partnership would operate inside Saudi regulatory and market frameworks. 

When Digital Systems Become National Assets

Saudi Arabia's interest in blockchain shows up as infrastructure planning. National data computing centers, blockchain processing capacity, and sovereign digital currency research all point toward the same concern: control over systems that increasingly underpin economic activity. 

Under the agreement, WhiteBIT provides infrastructure design and technical guidance, while Durrah AIFodah supports market entry, regulatory coordination, and local partnerships. The balance is important, given that technical capability alone doesn't move national projects forward, and neither does access without systems that grow responsibly. This collaboration meets in the middle of the overlap. 

Digital Currency and Regional Positioning

Central Bank Digital Currency development is one of the more closely watched components of the agreement. A CBDC framework has implications beyond domestic use. This is particularly important in regions where cross-border settlement standards are still forming.

Sure, some companies isolate their digital currency research, but the partnership places it alongside broader financial infrastructure work. That context suggests a long-term approach, where digital money is treated as part of a system.

Private Sector Partnerships as Strategy

The involvement of a European exchange and a Saudi holding company with royal backing reflects how technology partnerships increasingly operate as a form of alignment. While these arrangements don't look like traditional diplomacy, they often carry similar weight. 

They're built through coordination, shared incentives, and practical problem-solving. Over time, they influence how platforms integrate smoothly and which markets open with fewer frictions. 

Vision 2030 in Practice

Vision 2030 often gets discussed at a high level. Agreements like this one make it tangible as digital finance becomes part of economic restructuring. The partnership outlines projects that include stock market tokenization, CBDC framework development, and national data and mining centers. Each of them points back to domestic capacity and long-term resilience. 

Leadership and Framing the Work Ahead

Volodymyr Nosov, Founder and President of W Group, framed the agreement around continuity and responsibility. It's not about disruption. Nosov stated, “It is an honor to work alongside the Holding of His Royal Highness Prince Naif Bin Abdullah Bin Saud to build the foundations of Saudi Arabia's digital transformation. Together, we aim to establish and secure sovereign blockchain systems that will shape the Kingdom's technological future.” 

That emphasis on foundations feels deliberate. The agreement reinforces a shared focus on systems designed to last, adapt, and remain under national oversight. For Saudi Arabia, deals like this are all about preparation. The impact tends to surface gradually, through infrastructure that becomes ordinary.","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","cryptocurrency"

Colin Wood




January 12, 2026



Former New York Mayor Eric Adams on Monday sounded a familiar note, launching a new digital currency that he said will make his city the “crypto capital of the world.”

In a television interview with Fox Business on Monday, Adams said his new venture, called NYC Token, will provide funding for three initiatives: awareness and education programs for antisemitism and anti-Americanism, education on crypto and blockchain technologies for the city's youth and scholarships for students from underserved New York communities.

“There's a wave of anti-Americanism that's sweeping not only our Ivy League college campuses, but in our inner cities,” Adams told Fox's Maria Bartiromo. “And so the goal is how do we use a block change technology, with this token is one way, and a substantial amount of that's raised from this token is going to fight those three initiatives that you just pointed out.”

According to its website, the new digital token was “inspired by New York's resilience, diversity and ambition to become the crypto capitol of the world, something that was originally the vision of the former mayor, Eric Adams.” And during his Fox appearance Monday, Adams said blockchain “can actually improve government, not fight against government.”

Adams has long been a booster of cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies, including buying bitcoin with his first paycheck as mayor. He signed an executive order establishing an Office of Digital Assets and Blockchain Technology and developed an extensive blockchain plan for the city, which would have launched a pilot project led by the city's Department of Environmental Protection using the technology to verify asbestos certification. None of these projects are expected to proceed since Mayor Zohran Mamdani signed an order immediately after taking office that negated all Adams orders dating back to the former mayor's corruption charges.

Buying NYC tokens is easy, according to the website. Users need simply to download a cryptocurrency wallet such as MetaMask and create an account. Then they must purchase Ethereum, a different cryptocurrency, before logging onto the crypto exchange Uniswap and connecting their wallet, itself a five-step process. Then the user must enter an NYC contract address to begin trading their Ethereum for NYC tokens. A graphic shows that 1 billion tokens, with a market cap of $2.5 million, are available for purchase.

According to its website, NYC Token is “lightning fast,” “ultra secure” with “military-grade encryption and decentralized architecture,” and “community driven” — “Governed by the community, for the community. Your voice matters,” the site proclaims. Actual information on how the token works or how it will fund education initiatives is not available. As of Monday, many of the buttons on the website were broken.

When asked by Bartiromo about the coin's use case, Adams mentioned Walmart, which uses IBM's blockchain technology for procurement and supply chain management. Adams also mentioned that he spent time last week in the city of Dubai and Congo, places that he said could benefit from “things from New York.”","{'href': 'https://statescoop.com', 'title': 'StateScoop'}","cryptocurrency"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","Institutional crypto needs adoption to scale beyond speculation","https://crypto.news/institutional-crypto-needs-adoption-beyond-speculation/","Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:02:38 GMT","


        Share    


            Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news' editorial.        

Mid-October 2025 saw crypto's largest liquidation event in history, with $19 billion wiped out in 24 hours, after what many believe was a response to President Trump's announcement of potential substantial tariffs on China. This revealed a critical structural flaw: the fragility of liquidity when it is needed most. For an industry that constantly touts institutional adoption as its north star, it exposed how little real, resilient infrastructure there is when it matters. 

Market makers — the professional traders who quote buy and sell prices to keep markets functioning — are supposed to provide stability during volatility: quoting through volatility, absorbing panic selling, and providing exit liquidity. In practice, most venues reward them for being present 95% of the time, but not for staying when the knives are falling. 

While it is important to scrutinize market makers' actions during high volatility and liquidation pressures, their absence is often a rational response to a broken system. In an environment where platforms lack operational resilience and adequate backstop mechanisms, staying active during a liquidation event may be a fool's errand. We cannot expect market makers to act as safeguards if the infrastructure itself offers them no protection.

Real adoption requires what every functioning financial market provides: settlement guarantees, protections for users' deposits, platform reliability, and well-reasoned incentives, particularly under stress. This allows liquidity providers to stay the course. Moreover, it's not about who holds the assets, but who actually uses the rails. Holding Bitcoin on a balance sheet doesn't constitute adopting crypto technology any more than owning gold bars makes you a miner.

And right now, the numbers do not yet match the promise of programmable money and decentralized networks being used en masse by institutional entities. Take Hyperliquid, a premier decentralized exchange. Since May 25, 2025, daily active users (unique addresses trading at least $1K notional) for major Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) pairs have averaged 11,423. Around 50% of that volume was driven by an average of just 37 users. These numbers illustrate that without a better market structure, these innovations will remain lab experiments rather than scalable financial systems.

The path forward requires building the infrastructure that enables institutional participation and adoption. The CME Group handles three billion contracts worth approximately $1 quadrillion annually as part of the overall holistic risk management that protects users through due diligence requirements, anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance procedures, and audit trails. These requirements, when tailored thoughtfully to the needs of the business or product, build trust that allows, for example, teachers' pension funds to invest alongside hedge funds.The good news is that we now have the blockchain technology tools to bridge the gap between the safety/usability of traditional finance and the innovation of decentralization.

New blockchain technologies can now embed risk management directly into the infrastructure. Smart contracts can enforce risk management rules automatically, while Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and zero-knowledge proofs allow for the verification of credentials without exposing sensitive data. These tools enable the kind of oversight institutions require while preserving the efficiency and transparency benefits of blockchain technology and cryptography.

We are already seeing this shift from theory to practice. The 2022 Ooki DAO enforcement action caused token holders to think more critically about whether they can participate in governance due to potential legal or regulatory uncertainty and potential personal liability. New cryptographic functionalities are now available to help move the industry forward in a way that can ease those concerns and increase governance and user adoption. Decentralized governance can incorporate risk management frameworks, allowing institutions to participate.Regulatory bodies are beginning to recognize that risk management and decentralization are not mutually exclusive. Recently, the Bermuda Monetary Authority granted the first-ever license to a DAO-governed derivatives exchange. This approval sets a vital precedent: it proves that non-custodial, decentralized platforms can operate within recognized regulatory frameworks while ensuring users maintain total independent control of their assets and private keys.

We have the technology to meet institutional standards. As seen in the U.S. with the passage of the GENIUS Act legislation, innovation flourishes when paired with thoughtfully tailored rules of the road. Real adoption won't come from hype, corporate treasury holdings, speculation, or artificial metrics. It will come from the quiet, essential work of building infrastructure that financial institutions can actually trust.If market structure remains fragile, liquidity will remain fleeting. Instead, we must engineer resilience into the platform itself. By embedding institutional-grade performance and risk management directly into protocols, we bridge the gap between the traditional and decentralized markets. This is how we fulfill the technology's promise of creating a safe and efficient global system that is open to all.

At a point when financial oversight is adjusting to technological change, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is taking steps to ensure its regulations remain effective. Mike Selig, the CFTC Chair, has announced the creation of an innovation committee to advise the agency on emerging technologies that are transforming financial services. The initiative is intended to help the Commission develop regulatory approaches that are practical, clear, and aligned with current market conditions.

The Innovation Advisory Committee (IAC), rebranded from the former Technology Advisory Committee, brings together experts from industry, regulatory bodies, academia, and technology, offering a wide range of perspectives to guide the Commission.

Selig explained the committee's role in shaping market regulations. He stated in the release that “the Commission will develop fit-for-purpose market structure regulations for this new frontier of finance.” He also noted :

The Innovation Advisory Committee will play a critical role in advising the Commission on the commercial, economic, and practical considerations of emerging products, platforms, and business models in the financial markets so that it can develop clear rules of the road for the Golden Age of American Financial Markets.

The IAC's charter outlines its role and responsibilities, showing how the committee will support the Commission in adapting to emerging technologies such as crypto and artificial intelligence:

The CFTC Chair will sponsor the IAC and plans to appoint 12 initial members from the CEO Innovation Council. This group brings together leaders from both cryptocurrency and traditional finance. From the crypto industry, the committee includes Tyler Winklevoss of Gemini, Shayne Coplan of Polymarket, Tarek Mansour of Kalshi, and Kris Marszalek of Crypto.com, all serving as CEOs, along with Arjun Sethi, co-CEO of Kraken.

Established financial executives are also involved, including Jeff Sprecher of Intercontinental Exchange, Craig Donohue of Cboe Global Markets, and Adena Friedman of Nasdaq, providing a balanced perspective across sectors.

The CFTC is also encouraging members of the public to get involved by putting forward nominations for the committee and proposing topics they think should be prioritized, with submissions open until January 31, 2026.

Looking at the broader picture, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) emphasized the importance of cryptocurrency innovation for the United States' future. The firm pointed out that falling behind in technological development could have significant consequences for the country's economic strength and global standing, with effects reaching around the world.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","This new sugar tastes like the real thing without the usual downsides","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260112214302.htm","Tue, 13 Jan 2026 06:26:06 GMT","

For more than a century, scientists and food companies have been looking for ways to replicate the taste of sugar without its health drawbacks. From early sweeteners like saccharin in the 19th century to modern alternatives such as stevia and monk fruit, the goal has remained the same. The challenge has been finding something that delivers sugar's familiar flavor while avoiding excess calories, tooth decay, and increased risks of obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes.

A new study published in Cell Reports Physical Science suggests that researchers may be closer to that goal. Scientists at Tufts University have developed a biosynthetic method to produce tagatose, a naturally occurring but extremely rare sugar. Tagatose closely mimics the taste of table sugar and could offer a way to enjoy sweetness with fewer negative health effects. Researchers say it may even provide added benefits.

What Is Tagatose and Where It Comes From

Tagatose exists naturally, but only in very small quantities compared with common sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose. It appears in milk and other dairy products when lactose breaks down under heat or enzymatic activity, including during the production of yogurt, cheese, and kefir.

Tiny amounts of tagatose are also present in fruits like apples, pineapples, and oranges. However, it typically makes up less than 0.2% of the sugars found in these natural sources. Because of this scarcity, tagatose is usually produced through manufacturing rather than extracted directly from foods.

Engineering Bacteria to Make Rare Sugar

""There are established processes to produce tagatose, but they are inefficient and expensive,"" said Nik Nair, associate professor of chemical and biological engineering at Tufts.

To address this problem, the research team developed a new production strategy using genetically engineered bacteria. ""We developed a way to produce tagatose by engineering the bacteria Escherichia coli to work as tiny factories, loaded with the right enzymes to process abundant amounts of glucose into tagatose. This is much more economically feasible than our previous approach, which used less abundant and expensive galactose to make tagatose.""

The bacteria were modified to include a newly identified enzyme from slime mold called galactose-1-phosphate-selective phosphatase (Gal1P). This enzyme enables the bacteria to generate galactose directly from glucose. Another enzyme produced by the bacteria, known as arabinose isomerase, then converts the galactose into tagatose.

Using this method, the engineered bacteria can convert glucose into tagatose with yields as high as 95%. This represents a major improvement over traditional manufacturing techniques, which typically achieve yields ranging from 40 to 77%. The higher efficiency also makes the process significantly more cost-effective.

Sweetness, Safety, and Fewer Calories

Tagatose delivers about 92% of the sweetness of sucrose -- table sugar -- while containing roughly 60% fewer calories. It has been classified by the FDA as ""generally recognized as safe,"" meaning it can be used in consumer food products. This designation is shared by everyday ingredients such as salt, vinegar, and baking soda.

One reason tagatose may be beneficial for people with diabetes is how the body processes it. Only part of the sugar is absorbed in the small intestine, while much of it is fermented by gut bacteria in the colon. As a result, tagatose has a much smaller effect on blood glucose and insulin levels than conventional sugar. Clinical studies have shown only minimal increases in plasma glucose or insulin after consumption.

Tagatose may also support oral health. Unlike sucrose, which feeds bacteria that cause cavities, tagatose appears to limit the growth of some of those harmful microbes. Research also suggests it may have probiotic effects that promote healthier bacteria in both the mouth and the gut.

A Sugar That Cooks Like Sugar

Because it is low in calories and poorly absorbed by the body, tagatose functions well as a ""bulk sweetener."" This means it can replace sugar not only for sweetness but also for the physical properties sugar provides in cooking and baking. High intensity sweeteners cannot replicate this effect. Tagatose browns like table sugar when heated, and taste tests show it closely matches the flavor and mouthfeel of conventional sugar.

Why This Discovery Matters

""The key innovation in the biosynthesis of tagatose was in finding the slime mold Gal1P enzyme and splicing it into our production bacteria,"" said Nair. ""That allowed us to reverse a natural biological pathway that metabolizes galactose to glucose and instead generate galactose from glucose supplied as a feedstock. Tagatose and potentially other rare sugars can be synthesized from that point.""

The researchers say this approach could open the door to producing other rare sugars more efficiently, potentially reshaping how sweeteners are made and used in the future.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists discover how the uterus knows when to push during childbirth","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260112214313.htm","Tue, 13 Jan 2026 13:36:06 GMT","

Successful childbirth depends on the uterus producing steady, well-organized contractions that move the baby safely through delivery. Hormones such as progesterone and oxytocin play a major role in controlling this process. For years, however, researchers have also suspected that physical forces involved in pregnancy and birth, including stretching and pressure, contribute in important ways.

New research from Scripps Research, published in Science, now shows how the uterus detects and responds to these physical forces at the molecular level. The findings shed light on why labor sometimes slows or begins too early and could guide future efforts to improve treatments for pregnancy and delivery complications.

Pressure and Stretch as Biological Signals

""As the fetus grows, the uterus expands dramatically, and those physical forces reach their peak during delivery,"" says senior author Ardem Patapoutian, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator and the Presidential Endowed Chair in Neurobiology at Scripps Research. ""Our study shows that the body relies on special pressure sensors to interpret these cues and translate them into coordinated muscle activity.""

Patapoutian shared the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for identifying the cellular sensors that allow organisms to detect touch and pressure. These sensors are ion channels built from proteins known as PIEZO1 and PIEZO2, which enable cells to respond to mechanical force.

Two Sensors With Different Roles in Childbirth

In the new study, researchers found that PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 perform separate but complementary tasks during labor. PIEZO1 operates primarily within the smooth muscle of the uterus, where it detects rising pressure as contractions strengthen. PIEZO2, in contrast, is located in sensory nerves in the cervix and vagina. It becomes activated as the baby stretches these tissues, triggering a neural reflex that boosts uterine contractions.

Together, these sensors convert stretch and pressure into electrical and chemical signals that help synchronize contractions. If one pathway is disrupted, the other can partially compensate, helping labor continue.

What Happens When Force Sensors Are Removed

To test how essential these sensors are, the team used mouse models in which PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 were selectively removed from either uterine muscle or surrounding sensory nerves. Tiny pressure sensors measured contraction strength and timing during natural labor.

Mice lacking both PIEZO proteins showed weaker uterine pressure and delayed births, indicating that muscle-based sensing and nerve-based sensing normally work together. When both systems were lost, labor was significantly impaired.

Wiring the Uterus for Strong Contractions

Further investigation revealed that PIEZO activity helps regulate levels of connexin 43, a protein that forms gap junctions. These microscopic channels connect neighboring smooth muscle cells so they contract together rather than independently. When PIEZO signaling was reduced, connexin 43 levels dropped and contractions became less coordinated.

""Connexin 43 is the wiring that allows all the muscle cells to act together,"" says first author Yunxiao Zhang, a postdoctoral research associate in Patapoutian's lab. ""When that connection weakens, contractions lose strength.""

Evidence From Human Tissue

Samples of human uterine tissue showed patterns of PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 expression similar to those seen in mice. This suggests that a comparable force-sensing system likely operates in people. The findings may help explain labor problems marked by weak or irregular contractions that prolong delivery.

The results also align with clinical observations that fully blocking sensory nerves can lengthen labor.

""In clinical practice, epidurals are given in carefully controlled doses because blocking sensory nerves completely can make labor much longer,"" notes Zhang. ""Our data mirror that phenomenon; when we removed the sensory PIEZO2 pathway, contractions weakened, suggesting that some nerve feedback promotes labor.""

Potential Implications for Labor Care

The study opens the door to more targeted approaches to managing labor and pain. If researchers can develop safe ways to adjust PIEZO activity, it may become possible to either slow or strengthen contractions when needed. For those at risk of preterm labor, a PIEZO1 blocker, if developed, could work alongside current medications that relax uterine muscle by limiting calcium entry into cells. On the other hand, activating PIEZO channels might help restore contractions in stalled labor.

Although these applications remain far off, the underlying biology is becoming clearer.

How Hormones and Force Work Together

The research team is now examining how mechanical sensing interacts with hormonal control during pregnancy. Earlier studies show that progesterone, the hormone that keeps the uterus relaxed, can suppress connexin 43 expression even when PIEZO channels are active. This helps prevent contractions from starting too soon. As progesterone levels fall near the end of pregnancy, PIEZO-driven calcium signals may help set labor in motion.

""PIEZO channels and hormonal cues are two sides of the same system,"" points out Zhang. ""Hormones set the stage, and force sensors help determine when and how strongly the uterus contracts.""

Mapping the Nerve Pathways of Labor

Future studies will focus on the sensory nerve networks involved in childbirth, since not all nerves around the uterus contain PIEZO2. Some may respond to different signals and act as backup systems. Distinguishing nerves that promote contractions from those that transmit pain could eventually lead to more precise pain relief methods that do not slow labor.

For now, the findings highlight that the body's ability to sense physical force extends beyond touch and balance. It also plays a central role in one of biology's most critical processes.

""Childbirth is a process where coordination and timing are everything,"" says Patapoutian. ""We're now starting to understand how the uterus acts as both a muscle and a metronome to ensure that labor follows the body's own rhythm.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A new test reveals which antibiotics truly kill bacteria","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260112211455.htm","Tue, 13 Jan 2026 02:35:36 GMT","

Antibiotics are often judged by how well they slow or stop bacterial growth in laboratory tests. What is even more important, though, is whether those drugs actually kill bacteria inside the human body. Researchers at the University of Basel have now introduced a new way to measure how effectively antibiotics eliminate bacteria, not just suppress them.

This distinction has become critical as antibiotic resistance continues to spread. Resistant bacteria represent one of today's most serious global health threats. Through genetic mutations, many bacteria are becoming less responsive to commonly used drugs, making infections harder to treat and more likely to persist.

Dormant Bacteria and Lingering Infections

Even bacteria that are not resistant can sometimes survive antibiotic treatment. This often happens when bacteria enter a dormant state. In this condition, they stop multiplying, but antibiotics may fail to kill them. Once treatment ends, these dormant bacteria can become active again and restart the infection.

This challenge is especially severe in diseases such as tuberculosis and other complex infections that require many months of therapy. In such cases, choosing drugs that fully eliminate bacteria and completely clear the infection is essential.

A New Way to Predict Treatment Success

Traditional laboratory tests mainly show whether a drug prevents bacteria from growing, rather than confirming whether the bacteria are dead. To overcome this limitation, researchers led by Dr. Lucas Boeck from the Department of Biomedicine at the University of Basel and University Hospital Basel developed a new testing method designed to better predict real world treatment outcomes. Their findings were published in the scientific journal Nature Microbiology.

The new approach, known as ""antimicrobial single-cell testing,"" uses advanced microscopy to observe millions of individual bacteria across thousands of different test conditions. ""We use it to film each individual bacterium over several days and observe whether and how quickly a drug actually kills it,"" explains Lucas Boeck.

This technique allows researchers to determine exactly how many bacteria are eliminated by a treatment and how efficiently that elimination occurs across an entire bacterial population.

To demonstrate the method, the team tested 65 different drug combinations against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium responsible for tuberculosis. They also applied the approach to bacterial samples from 400 patients with another severe lung infection caused by Mycobacterium abscessus, a close relative of the tuberculosis pathogen.

Why Some Bacteria Outlast Antibiotics

The researchers observed clear differences between drug combinations, as well as differences between bacterial strains from different patients. Specialists refer to this second factor as antibiotic tolerance. Further analysis showed that specific genetic traits influence how well bacteria can endure treatment and effectively wait it out.

""The better bacteria tolerate an antibiotic, the lower the chances of therapeutic success are for the patients,"" says Lucas Boeck. When compared with results from clinical studies and animal models, the new testing method closely matched how well various treatments actually cleared infections.

Benefits for Patients and Drug Development

So far, antimicrobial single-cell testing has mainly been used in research settings, but it could eventually be applied in hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry. According to Boeck, the method could help doctors select antibiotic therapies that are better matched to the specific bacterial strain infecting each patient.

""Our test method allows us to tailor antibiotic therapies specifically to the bacterial strains in individual patients."" He adds that a deeper understanding of the genetic factors behind antibiotic tolerance could lead to faster and simpler testing methods and improve predictions about how effective new antibiotics will be during development.

""Last but not least, the data can help researchers to better understand the survival strategies of pathogens and thus lay the foundation for new, more effective therapeutic approaches,"" says Boeck.

Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides multiwavelength physiological sensing for standoff biometric detection; however, ambient light fluctuations limit the robustness of conventional systems. Here we introduce a lock-in camera-based HSI framework that rapidly modulates wavelength-specific illumination and synchronizes detection, enabling robust hyperspectral video reconstruction under varying ambient conditions. In photoplethysmography validation, the system estimates heart rate with errors below 3 bpm, outperforming conventional HSI, which typically exceeds 10 bpm. Using dual-wavelength illumination (660 nm, 940 nm), we further extract blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) dynamics with a maximum error under 3% and a 2.7-fold improvement in mean accuracy under fluctuating light. We use machine learning models trained on the high-fidelity photoplethysmography signals to reconstruct blood pressure and electrocardiogram waveforms accurately. Our approach could offer a practical route for hyperspectral biosensing, advancing robust, multiparameter biometric detection for remote health assessment.

Some 150 million years ago, Europe was tropical — and mostly underwater. The entire continent was closer to the equator than it is today, and what is now Germany and its neighbouring countries was submerged under a shallow inland sea, dotted with islands.

‘Weird' dinosaur prompts rethink of bird evolution

‘Weird' dinosaur prompts rethink of bird evolution

On one cluster of islands, there were unusual creatures that didn't fit in with the rest of the fauna. These were some of the earliest birds on the planet: about the size of crows, with black feathers, and probably partial to eating insects. They weren't great fliers, spending most of their time on the ground and occasionally flapping into the air — perhaps to escape sneaking predators1. They also didn't look like modern birds. They had teeth in their jaws and claws at the ends of their wings — features seen on no adult birds today. These German animals were Archaeopteryx, and they bore many traces of their dinosaur ancestors.

Fossils of Archaeopteryx are some of the most famous in history, but this creature is also an enigma. For more than a century, Archaeopteryx has been the only known bird genus from the Jurassic: the period when birds first evolved. Many other dinosaur-era birds have been discovered over the past few decades, but they are all from the subsequent period, the Cretaceous: a time when many diverse types of bird lived around the world. The group's origins remained lost in time.

Now, researchers finally have a second genus of Jurassic birds. Baminornis, discovered in China and described in February 2025, instantly expanded scientists' knowledge of the earliest birds. Baminornis is unlike Archaeopteryx, hinting at a complex evolutionary story. In parallel, the description of a remarkably well-preserved Archaeopteryx specimen, which had remained hidden for decades, has shed unprecedented light on the first birds. Finds such as these are revealing clues about how and why birds evolved, and whether they evolved powered flight just once or many times during the age of the dinosaurs.

Today, birds are one of the most successful and diverse animal groups, with about 10,000 known species2. They vary from minuscule hummingbirds that can hover in mid-air to great voyagers such as the wandering albatross, top predators such as golden eagles and large flightless creatures such as emus.

Over the past half century, researchers have established that birds evolved from dinosaurs: specifically, the theropods, the group that includes the turkey-sized Velociraptor and the towering Allosaurus.

However, reconstructing the evolutionary history of birds has proved remarkably tricky. “Birds and bird-like dinosaurs are super rare in the fossil record,” says Jingmai O'Connor, a palaeontologist at the Field Museum in Chicago, Illinois.

Blame anatomy for their rarity. “Birds, generally, are small and they have delicate, hollow bones and lightweight skeletons,” says Stephen Brusatte, a palaeontologist at the University of Edinburgh, UK. This means that their bones are more likely to be broken and crushed in rough environments, such as fast-flowing rivers, in which a large skeleton, such as that of a Tyrannosaurus rex, might survive.

Given all that, the preservation of Archaeopteryx fossils is something of a miracle. The first specimens were discovered in the early 1860s: initially a feather, which was the first fossil feather ever found3, and then a skeleton missing its head. The timing was fortunate: Charles Darwin had published On the Origin of Species in 1859, presenting his arguments that natural selection led to the formation of new species and, ultimately, radically new kinds of organism. The first Archaeopteryx fossil, discovered just a few years later, was a dramatic example of a transitional fossil: an animal with some bird-like traits but also some dinosaur-like traits.

Arguments have raged for decades about two key questions: could Archaeopteryx fly, and does it count as a bird? It did have pennaceous feathers, which help modern birds to fly4. But other aspects of its anatomy were less well-suited to sustained flight. “Archaeopteryx has a long tail, like a raptor dinosaur,” says Brusatte. This would have been awkward in flight: modern birds have short, stubby tail bones.

Likewise, Archaeopteryx doesn't seem to have had a sternum (breastbone) to which the powerful wing muscles could have been attached. “That's a really puzzling thing,” says Talia Lowi-Merri, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who has shown that sternums evolved stepwise in later birds5.

It might be that Archaeopteryx had a sternum made of cartilage, which would not have fossilized, but this would have been a weaker anchor for the muscles than would bone. “If flight were present, it would be less strong than modern bird flight,” says Lowi-Merri. As a result, many biologists suspect that Archaeopteryx were poor fliers, like modern chickens.

Despite the growing body of information about Archaeopteryx, it can tell us only so much. All the fossils come from Germany, from what were once islands in a shallow sea. Some of the islands had lagoons filled with calm and often saline water, into which Archaeopteryx bodies could fall and be slowly buried and fossilized. “That's a one-in-a-trillion circumstance,” says Brusatte.

Worse, it is one point on a very long timeline. Archaeopteryx fossils are all about 150 million years old: from towards the end of the Jurassic period, which lasted from 201.4 million to 143.1 million years ago. But after Archaeopteryx, there are no more bird fossils for millions of years.

67-million-year-old fossil upends bird evolutionary tree

For the subsequent Cretaceous period (143.1 million to 66 million years ago), the story is different. In eastern Spain, the fossil site Las Hoyas has yielded several birds and bird-like dinosaurs since the 1980s. More recently, sites in northeast China have emerged as a treasure trove of delicate fossils, including birds, that were part of the Jehol Biota, an ecosystem that existed about 135 million to 120 million years ago.

“There's so many Cretaceous birds,” says Brusatte. Many are not the ancestors of living birds: instead, they belong to groups, such as the enantiornithines, that died out at the end of the Cretaceous, in the asteroid-related mass extinction that also wiped out all non-bird dinosaurs.

All told, Cretaceous birds and bird-like dinosaurs are known from Eastern Asia, North and South America, Madagascar and Antarctica. Clearly, by the early Cretaceous, birds had diversified and gone global.

But the late Jurassic cupboard remained frustratingly bare save Archaeopteryx — until the discovery of Baminornis.

Since 2022, palaeontologist Min Wang at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing and his colleagues have been exploring a new collection of fossils: the Zhenghe Fauna, in Fujian province in southeast China. Within the first year, they found a fossil they named Fujianvenator: a bird-like dinosaur probably more closely related to birds than to other dinosaurs. Fujianvenator had long hindlimbs, which suggested that it might have spent a lot of time wading in water. The team dated the Zhenghe Fauna to 148 million to 150 million years ago: roughly contemporary with Archaeopteryx6.

“This specimen gave us a lot of hope,” says Wang. “Maybe we could find some more interesting fossils in that locality.” The presence of freshwater animals such as turtles and small fish indicated that the Zhenghe Fauna was the preserved remains of a wetland: an ideal preservation spot for birds.

The researchers soon hit the jackpot, and described7 Baminornis in February 2025. It was a small bird, with a mass of 140–300 grams. Most strikingly, the five lowest vertebrae of the tail had fused together to form a stumpy bone called the pygostyle. This is the norm in modern birds and is also seen in Cretaceous birds, but is absent in Baminornis's famous contemporary, Archaeopteryx.

This was a surprise, Wang says. Given how early Baminornis was, one might have expected to find a transitional stage — “maybe some birds have a shorter tail but still do not have a pygostyle” — but instead, his team found a Jurassic bird with a fully formed pygostyle. He argues that this means the first birds might have predated Archaeopteryx and Baminornis. “It pushed back the emergence of the origination of birds much earlier than we thought,” he says. “Is it possible that maybe some middle or early Jurassic birds had already evolved?”

“It's telling us that birds already had been experimenting and developing more-sophisticated aerodynamic and flying styles by the end of the Jurassic,” says Brusatte. The fact that Archaeopteryx and Baminornis were so different suggests that birds were already diversified, hinting at an earlier evolutionary history than previously thought.

However, O'Connor cautions against drawing big conclusions from Baminornis, because early interpretations of new fossils can prove to be incorrect on closer examination. “I think we still need to wait to really understand what the significance of these fossils is going to be,” she says.

In any case, even with Baminornis, the Jurassic bird record is still extremely thin, meaning that many questions remain unanswered. “Did birds go global as soon as they originated?” wonders Brusatte. Pterosaurs and bats, the other flying vertebrates, spread quickly — but if Jurassic birds did the same, scientists haven't found the traces yet.

The senator wanted a promise. A solemn vow. For the last six years—or maybe the last decade or quarter century, depending on how you count it—the United States and China had been locked in a space race, a contest to see which nation could put its people on the moon. Senator Ted Cruz wanted President Donald Trump's nominee to run NASA, Jared Isaacman, to pledge that the US would not lose.

Cruz brought a little surprise to Isaacman's confirmation hearing last April. It was a poster of the moon. On one side stood three astronauts and a giant Chinese flag. On the other were two more figures in space suits, with the tiniest Stars and Stripes planted in the lunar soil. Cruz apologized for the imbalance. “My team used ChatGPT,” explained the senator, who chairs the committee that oversees NASA.

Then Cruz, with a bit more seriousness, asked Isaacman, “Do we have your commitment that you will not allow the scenario on the right of this poster to happen? That China will not beat us to the moon?”

Isaacman, a billionaire entrepreneur who had paid for his own missions to space, replied, “Senator, I only see the left-hand portion of that poster.”

It was a red-meat, fuck-yeah, pitch-perfect response. And Isaacman may have meant it. But by the time of his testimony, the Trump administration had started a process that would lay waste to NASA, pushing nearly 4,000 agency employees to quit. Then the White House proposed a massive, 24 percent cut to NASA's budget. Then Trump yanked Isaacman's nomination and named a new part-time acting chief, a fellow who boasted in his official NASA biography that he is one-half of “America's first and longest-married reality TV couple.” Then that guy picked a fight with Elon Musk, who's building NASA's moon lander. And Isaacman was back in the running. In December, Trump capped off the year with an executive order pushing Americans to get back to the moon by 2028.

If all of this sounds suboptimal to you, welcome to the club, space ranger. That dysfunction is one of many reasons why the vast majority of the two dozen sources I interviewed for this story believe that China will put people on the moon first. I spoke with nine former NASA officials who served at the highest rungs of the space agency under presidents Trump and Biden; none of them were optimistic about America's chances. “We did the worst of all worlds,” one of the nine tells me. “We positioned it as a race without planning to win.”

The original space program was the ultimate symbol of America at its screaming-eagle apex. Rocket scientist was shorthand for brilliant, and many of them were working in Huntsville, Alabama, aka Rocket City. The word astronaut was synonymous with grit, and you could find the gutsiest of them in Houston. Moonshot was (and is) code for something borderline impossible. Space races have helped spur the development of everything from the integrated circuit to the solar panel to 5G. But that was before America decided to stab itself in the brain.

Today, much of the world drives Chinese electric cars, powers their homes with Chinese solar panels, and stays in touch with made-in-China phones. Chinese scientists have eclipsed their American counterparts in the production of high-quality research, and the White House has responded by gutting American science funding and charging $100,000 to let in highly skilled immigrants. So if Chinese astronauts step down from their lander and livestream the results in 4K—and to be clear, it's still an “if” at this point—it'll be more than a point of national pride for Beijing. It'll be a declaration that the American Century is officially over.

About 18 months ago and some 3,000 miles above the Earth, the Chinese robotic spacecraft Chang'e-6 released its reentry capsule, which skipped in and out of the atmosphere before parachuting into the grasslands of China's Inner Mongolia. Inside were about 4 pounds of moon rocks and soil. It was the first sample return from the far side in human history.

Putting people on the moon might seem like a so-what sequel, coming 50-plus years after Apollo. But there's a reason no one's been back to the moon in half a century. It is maddeningly difficult to put anything down there, even little unmanned landers. A handful of soft-landing missions have succeeded, most of them Chinese. More numerous are the flops of the Japanese, Russian, Israeli, American, and Indian space programs.

The reasons for failure are many—light gravity and uneven terrain make it easy for a lander to tip over; no atmosphere means firing rockets to brake; that firing kicks up clouds of dust that can limit visibility. “Once you start slowing down, within a matter of single-digit seconds, you are on an intercept course with the moon, and you don't have enough propellant to go back to lunar orbit and try again,” says Will Coogan, a chief engineer at Firefly Aerospace, the only company to pull off a fully successful robotic moon landing, ever.

Operations around the lunar poles are an “order of magnitude” tougher, a person who oversaw NASA's lunar program tells me. Getting into the proper orbital plane requires more maneuvering. For consistent communication with ground control, you need to position a relay satellite around the moon. (As China did, about six weeks before landing Chang'e-6.) Once you're there, be careful. Miles-deep craters are shadowed in near-eternal night, which means no solar power and temperatures that can drop below –200 degrees Celsius.

Yet that's exactly where China's heading. Scientists believe the poles have enormous pockets of ice—and potentially helium-3, an isotope that's extremely scarce on Earth. Helium-3 could unlock quantum computing and possibly nuclear fusion, many experts believe. “Let's say on the lunar surface, helium-3 becomes a new source of fusion power,” as Isaacman told Cruz at that April confirmation hearing. “It could shift the balance of power here on Earth. I don't think we can afford to find that out the hard way.”

Both the US and China have dreamed of building a base at the south pole, and both would like to claim the prime landing sites. The upcoming Chang'e-7 mission aims to be the first to extract water from the moon. One desirable landing site is a spot high on the ridge of the Shackleton Crater, near the lunar south pole, at a location that's almost always light. Chang'e-7 will carry instruments from Russia and several American allies—Italy, Switzerland, Thailand, Egypt, and Bahrain.

The Chinese National Space Administration says the launch should happen in August. “When they say they're going to do something by x, they tend to do it,” says Dean Cheng, a senior fellow at the Potomac Institute for Policy Studies who's been tracking the progress.

China's space efforts aren't as sophisticated as America's; Beijing is only now testing reusable rockets. And every space program faces mishaps. In November, three Chinese astronauts were stranded aboard their space station for nine days after a piece of orbiting junk damaged their return capsule. But China's crewed lunar effort, for now, seems to be more or less on target. The idea is that a pair of rockets—one carrying the crew and service capsules, the other a lander—will head to the moon. They'll rendezvous in lunar orbit, and a pair of astronauts will set foot on the surface. Exactly where they'll land hasn't been confirmed. But testing for all of the components is well under way. A spokesperson for the China Manned Space Agency has said the mission will launch “before 2030.”

When will American astronauts get there? That's a bit more complicated.

Warning: the recent history of the US program to return astronauts to the moon is so contradictory, so politicized, so frustrating, it's going to make your head hurt. As Jim Bridenstine, who served as Trump's first NASA administrator, recently told Congress, “This is an architecture that no NASA administrator that I'm aware of would have selected.”

“No way to run a program, in my opinion,” says the NASA official who helped oversee the lunar initiative. “You can't make this shit up. Really can't. It's really crazy.”

The original Apollo program was insanely ambitious, but there was a clarity to the mission. One giant rocket, carrying one tiny crew capsule and one even tinier landing module. The capsule would orbit the moon, and the lander would ferry astronauts to and from the surface. That was all. The new US moon program—Artemis, named after Apollo's twin sister—isn't nearly so neat.

For starters: The main rocket and capsule are made up of leftovers. Back in 2010, the Senate ordered NASA to build a rocket with old engines from the space shuttle program and repurpose a capsule from a Bush-era deep-space project. The rocket, known as the Space Launch System, would lift off carrying astronauts in a capsule named Orion. The combination of SLS and Orion has cost taxpayers tens of billions of dollars. It has flown exactly once. A second flight is slotted for February.

The Orion capsule was built on the heavy side, to give astronauts extra protection against radiation and other risks. But the capsule's propulsion was under-powered to reach a tight lunar orbit. (The European Space Agency, which provided the thing, said it couldn't afford to supply more.)

NASA engineers figured out, however, that the capsule could reach a farther-out, super-elliptical orbit, and that orbit would still allow for landings on the lunar poles. The drawback: At that orbit, completing a circuit of the moon takes nearly a week. Once you drop astronauts off, they're stuck on the surface for days and days. A tear in a spacesuit or a malfunction in the lander's life support system might turn into a nightmare.

NASA also concluded that it needed to put a miniature space station in orbit around the moon. I must've heard a half-dozen rationales for this space station. It wouldn't necessarily help with rescue efforts, but it could communicate with astronauts on the ground. And during later, longer-duration missions, it would give astronauts a more hospitable place to work and rest. Maybe.

Some at NASA view the so-called lunar “Gateway” as a kind of insurance policy. As one former official told me, “There's the belief that if you have these pieces pre-positioned in space, we'll have a long-term program that Congress is less willing to walk away from.” All of this was meant to take a decade or so to come together—like, 2028 or 2029. Until Mike Pence stepped up to the mic.

The American flag behind the vice president was large, almost comically so. Also behind him was an original space capsule from the Apollo days. Pence was exuding confidence that day in the spring of 2019. He proclaimed to the crowd at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville that “the first woman and the next man on the moon will both be American astronauts, launched by American rockets, from American soil.” He also announced out of nowhere that the schedule was cut in half. It would all be done in five years, by 2024. The end of what the administration hoped would be a second Trump term.

People in the room—and around the space agency—were stunned. As a former top NASA official recalls, “Everyone knew from the moment Pence said that, that it was pretty much bullshit.”

Reporters quizzed NASA's leaders on the new deadline. “I do not like being—I will not lie,” a second former NASA official tells me. “So I said, ‘I think it's a great goal, but like, this is going to be hard.' And Jim [Bridenstine] told me later, he goes, ‘The one thing you need to start learning to say is: We will be on the moon in 2024.'”

It was a ridiculous commitment. Much of the gear to get back to the moon was still on the literal drawing board: NASA hadn't even handed out contracts for the lunar landers yet. The space agency's bureaucracy had a well-earned reputation for taking the maximum number of people and the maximum amount of time to get things done. “You know, 20 layers of boards and councils to get to a decision, or 480 people on a call. Do we really need that?” wonders a third former senior official.

The space program, once the avatar of American success, was becoming emblematic of American drift. Contractors complained about NASA's endless requirements and safety checks; NASA officials complained about contractors' empty factory floors and bankers' hours; they both complained about the White House's budget office micromanaging their launch dates; and absolutely everyone complained about the Senate force-feeding them tech they didn't want.

Still, there were folks at NASA who were glad to have the 2024 deadline. After years of being lost in space, it was at least some sort of direction. Eight missions were sketched out for the Artemis program over the next decade. The pieces were already in place for the first two, an unmanned test of SLS and Orion that would orbit the moon and a manned lunar flyby. By the end of the first Trump administration, one last major component remained for Artemis III, the big one, the return of astronauts to the lunar surface. NASA had to award a contract to a company to design, build, and test the lander to bring astronauts down to the moon.

Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin tried positioning itself as a major contender. But, as journalist Christian Davenport recounts in his book Rocket Dreams, Pence's top aide told a Blue Origin exec he had a “Washington Post problem”—as in, the paper dared to criticize his boss's big space speech. Joe Biden's win in 2020 made that problem go away temporarily. But there was another issue: The bid Blue Origin submitted for the lander cost twice as much as Musk's. (NASA and Blue Origin declined to comment on this story; SpaceX did not respond.)

SpaceX's bid was in a class of its own. Its proposed lander was actually the second stage of its giganto, still-in-development rocket. The lander's interior volume would be 150 times that of the Apollo lunar module, according to one SpaceX veteran, and more than that of the International Space Station. It was ludicrously big. “Like rowing across the Atlantic Ocean in a row boat and then taking a luxury cruise liner into the harbor,” is how a second SpaceX veteran put it. A “planet-colonizer,” is what Musk called it—his ride to his preferred destination, Mars. That's why his bid was so much lower than Blue Origin's; he wanted to build it anyway.

In between agency administrators, in 2021, NASA's leaders gave Musk $3 billion for the lander. In some ways, they didn't have a choice. The agency's budget was impossibly tight. And if his design worked, it would supercharge human spaceflight for decades to come. But competitors grumbled; Blue Origin sued. The criticism grew louder when, years later, one of the NASA officials behind the decision took a job with Musk.

By then, Musk's reputation for overpromising had been cemented. It was clear the space agency hadn't fully understood the risks involved in Musk's bid. That information gap would set the US lunar program back years.

You might ask yourself at this point why we should care about getting people on the moon or who gets there first. Truth be told, NASA and its contractors have had a hard time producing a consistent answer themselves.

Some will tell you there's a whole lunar economy waiting to be unleashed. Some will say that cislunar orbit is a great place to spy on (and even attack) your rival's satellites. Some will tell you that exploration is a goal in and of itself. Some will ask you if you've seen one (1) science fiction movie in your life. Because then you've had the feeling, however fleeting, that absolutely nothing could be cooler than setting foot on an alien moon.

The mix of rationales helps explain why the Artemis program looks the way it does, a mismatched collection of leftovers and imports from the future, a blend of realpolitik and revolutionary. It's a forced marriage between government contractor graybeards and billionaires with stars in their eyes. On the one hand, you've got a rocket and a capsule that can feel like unwieldy remakes of the Apollo program; on the other, an interplanetary “colonizer” and a freakin' lunar space station. The collection is meant to support what an extremely understated former NASA official calls a “portfolio” approach to mission success. If Artemis hits any one of these many goals (jazzy lunar businesses, the next GPS-scale invention), the logic goes, the whole thing will have been worth it.

Maybe this makes sense to you, maybe it doesn't. But here's what everyone agrees on: The US and China are in a multifront contest for global influence. Beijing clearly has the momentum; now imagine its velocity after a moon landing. “If you're trying to choose, who do I want to partner with? Whose team do I want to be on?” asks the American Enterprise Institute's Todd Harrison, one of Washington's sharper analysts of defense and space policy. “Do you want to be on the team that's a bunch of has-beens? Or do you want to be on the team that is rapidly developing and has leapfrogged ahead of the United States?”

In September, Bridenstine testified before Cruz's Senate committee, warning that the US plan was in real danger. He focused his remarks on Starship, the massive SpaceX craft that's supposed to bring astronauts to the lunar surface. It's “important for the country, and it's transformational,” Bridenstine said. If and when it starts to work, that is. In the short term, it makes Artemis way more complicated. Starship is behind schedule, with a number of rather public explosions. But even if it were working perfectly, Starship offers a profoundly complicated ride to the moon. NASA officials didn't realize how complicated until after they gave SpaceX billions to build their lander.

A fully loaded, moon-bound Starship expends almost all of its fuel to get to low Earth orbit. So that Starship needs to refill its tank before it heads to the moon, requiring the launch of more and more refueling Starships.

Starship runs on liquid oxygen and methane. They have to be kept ultracool, at –161 degrees Celsius or below. But direct exposure to the sun heats Starship up, evaporating some of that fuel. That could mean even more refueling missions to make up the difference. If things go really badly, the fuel might evaporate more quickly than SpaceX can get refueling rockets into space. “That whole in-space refueling thing has never been tested,” Bridenstine added. “We're talking about cryogenic liquid oxygen, cryogenic liquid methane being transferred in space—never been done before, and we're going to do it dozens of times.”

Engineers at NASA's Johnson Space Center recently calculated that one lunar mission could require more than 40 Starship launches. Refueling tests that were originally supposed to begin in 2023 are now “targeted to take place in 2026,” SpaceX says. As a reminder, China's lunar mission will require two rockets.

This could've been a moment when the US changed course and declared that it doesn't matter who repeats the Apollo landing first. Sean Duffy—the former reality star and secretary of transportation serving as acting NASA chief—took the opposite approach. He doubled down on beating China, and he blamed Starship for imperiling the lunar race. In October, Duffy said he'd formally ask other companies if they could build a lander faster than Musk. “We're not going to wait for one company,” Duffy told CNBC. “We're going to push this forward and win the second space race against the Chinese. Get back to the moon, set up a camp, a base.” He also gave SpaceX 10 days to submit a proposal for speeding up its lander effort.

Musk responded with his usual maturity. He called the NASA chief “Sean Dummy” in a post on X. In another, Musk tweeted a meme at Duffy, saying, “Why are you gae?”

SpaceX wasn't used to this kind of treatment. (“Here's the way NASA works with SpaceX: They've learned to say, ‘You just keep blowing things up until you've got something that works a few times in a row. Then we'll swoop in,'” one of the former NASA officials tells me.) But it was clear SpaceX was listening. A week after Musk's mean tweets, the company said it was working on “a simplified mission architecture and concept of operations.”

Bezos' company reacted quickly, too. During the Biden years, NASA had also given Blue Origin a contract for lunar landers. Blue Moon Mark 1 was a robotic model, meant for cargo missions. Blue Moon Mark 2 was bigger (though nowhere near Starship's size) and meant to eventually carry astronauts. Team Bezos reportedly pitched Frankensteining them together into a sort of Mark 1.5, creating a human-ready version of Mark 1 with elements gleaned from Mark 2. Then the company announced a bigger version of its rocket that could carry more weight to lunar orbit.

A bunch of other aerospace companies are looking to join the race, as NASA evaluates SpaceX's and Blue Origin's accelerated proposals. Isaacman hasn't said definitively whether he'll continue Duffy's push for a new lander contract. Actually building the thing would still take years.

Maybe a whole new lander will be able to beat China. The word is that it won't—that SpaceX or Blue Origin present the only realistic, if unlikely, shots. Even if a new lander does somehow work, there's fear in and around NASA that such a dash will sap the political will for long-term moon missions with potentially bigger payoffs. And this will be another case of planting flags in the lunar dust.

It certainly won't paper over Artemis' many uncertainties. By some estimates, each launch of the SLS rocket could cost as much as $4 billion, and then there are all the accompanying Starship launches. The rationale for the Gateway space station continues to get harder to parse. One space policy official tried to justify it to me by saying Gateway could be flown out to Mars if the moon thing doesn't work out.

And while NASA rushes to figure all of this out, the space agency is in turmoil.

In November, with drama mounting around Artemis, Isaacman was suddenly renominated for the space job.

No explanation was provided. Isaacman's return was almost universally heralded in the space community; this is a guy famous for commanding the first all-civilian spaceflight, not for starring in The Real World: Boston. But it's not clear how much of NASA will be left for him given the nearly 4,000 employees who accepted the Trump administration's buyouts. Many top performers are gone. Hundreds more employees and contractors have been laid off. Project 2025 guru Russ Vought, who serves as the head of the White House's Office of Management and Budget, has very specific ideas about space. His initial budget proposal to Congress slashed NASA's funding by a quarter. One Trump administration official compared him to a vicious Civil War general: “He's General Sherman on his march to the sea, burning down the government as he goes.”

Cruz swooped in to insert into a budget bill a combined $7 billion for SLS, Orion, and Gateway. The logic, at least for Orion and SLS, is that they're already built, proven, and rated for human flight. But if you want a microcosm of the political psychosis gripping Washington, you could do worse. The Senate is foisting rockets that neither Duffy nor Isaacman wants long-term, all while planning to cut the agency to the bone. Is NASA a bloated bureaucracy? For sure. Is carpet-bombing it the best option? Unlikely.

But it is of a piece. Under Trump, the US has declared China a geopolitical competitor—and tried to sabotage what competitive edges remain. Meanwhile, China is presenting itself as a logical inheritor of the Apollo program. Those early astronauts wanted us to think of Earth as our one, shared home. Today, that kind of language is considered too “woke” for Washington; the US's space billionaires talk more about escaping this hellhole. It's China that's touting technologies to make Earth sustainable and positioning itself as the world's stable trading partner. It's luring scientists and engineers that the US is actively turning away with its immigration policies—a darkly ironic turn, given how much the original space race was run by immigrants.

It'll take a shock to turn that around. But there are some who think that maybe it'd be OK for Beijing to have its Sputnik (or Apollo 11) moment. Maybe America needs to be surprised and shamed before it'll get its act together. “There are definitely people in the space industry,” says one industry executive, “that see the Chinese landing on the moon before us as probably a net positive.” Maybe then Musk would really focus on building rockets, instead of spending so much of his time being a racist agitator online. Maybe Bezos' rocket company will become a more serious competitor. Maybe then the United States will care about slipping to second-rate.

If federal immigration agents are coming to your area—or have already arrived—you may be frantically making plans to lay low at home, or perhaps grabbing your whistle and lacing up your sneakers to join a neighborhood watch. It's a terrifying situation for undocumented residents and all American immigrants, and the climate has even become fraught for US citizens too. There are no simple answers for how to protect yourself and others in every scenario, but there are frameworks you can use for weighing your options.

The presence of immigration agents in cities and towns around the country has starkly increased in recent months, and tensions have escalated in step. On Wednesday, a federal agent shot and killed 37-year-old Minneapolis resident and US citizen Renee Nicole Good in her car during an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operation. Having already deployed 2,000 agents to Minnesota, DHS reportedly planned this week to send 1,000 more. ""There are now more ICE agents in Minnesota than there are combined in Minneapolis police force and St. Paul police force,” Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar said on Friday. “So they are outnumbering our own local police officers out on the streets."" (Minnesota and Illinois have since filed lawsuits in federal court to end the ICE “invasion” in those states.)

Elsewhere, Customs and Border Protection agents shot two people in a car in Portland, Oregon, on Thursday, hospitalizing both. These tragedies are just the latest in a series of violent incidents involving immigration agents that have escalated since US president Donald Trump took office a year ago with a sweeping anti-immigration agenda. In addition to intense activity in Minneapolis and Portland, ICE and CBP have carried out deportation operations across the US.

“The number of ICE agents has dramatically increased, the sheer presence in people's communities is larger,” says Jennifer Whitlock, senior policy counsel at the National Immigration Law Center. “And this means that the risk of encountering an ICE officer has really increased for people, even if you're not in any way attached to immigration.”

Problems have persisted for years with ICE and CBP actions—including arrests and detentions—that accidentally ensnare US citizens and other documented residents. Additionally, the agencies' operations have a history of aggression and mistreatment in dealing with suspects. Immigration infractions are typically civil, not criminal offenses. Over the last year, though, the Department of Homeland Security's budget for immigration enforcement has expanded substantially at the same time that public unrest about the activity has grown. The result is a charged climate in which standard interactions can quickly, and dangerously, escalate.

“We're surging operations because of the dangerous situation we see in this country,” homeland security secretary Kristi Noem said in a press conference on Wednesday. “We should all work together to protect our citizens.”

Many see immigration enforcement's track record and current activity very differently, though.

“For its entire existence, ICE has been a very violent agency and a very unaccountable agency without a lot of oversight or transparency,” says Nithya Nathan-Pineau, policy attorney and strategist at the Immigrant Legal Resource Center.

She notes that as immigration officers have been involved in more and more violent incidents in recent months, it has become harder than ever to offer simple, definitive advice to people about assessing risk in interactions with federal agents.

Numerous sources told WIRED that their trainings and materials about interacting with federal immigration agents are actively evolving to reflect the current moment. For example, one core point has long been to explain the difference between a judicial warrant signed by a judge that gives law enforcement the right to, say, enter a person's home versus the administrative warrants that ICE agents often carry that do not give them that right. “Don't open the door for ICE” is a common refrain. But this type of information, while still accurate, does not fully account for the chaotic intensity of current US immigration enforcement.

“In the past, we would encourage people to exercise your right to protest or record video to document,” the National Immigration Law Center's Whitlock says. “We always talked about risk assessment and how some people are more vulnerable than others, but now it's not just risk of arrest at a protest, it's risk of physical harm. I don't think we fully anticipated how ICE and CBP would ignore and violate people's constitutional rights.”

In short, there is some risk inherent in any interaction with federal immigration officials, whether you're a US citizen or not. Even if you aren't willing to expose yourself in that way, though, you can still take action to meaningfully and concretely help people in your community affected by the Trump administration's policies.

Depending on your situation, you should make a plan in case you end up interacting with immigration enforcement while out and about.

In its online guidance, the nonprofit National Immigrant Justice Center says individuals and communities can create a “safety plan” to help be best prepared in case ICE operatives arrive in the area. Such a plan could involve identifying trusted family members, friends, or colleagues who can act as emergency contacts for people who could be the target of federal immigration actions, or anyone who could come into contact with agents. Memorize their phone numbers and also make sure that your child's school or daycare has emergency contacts on file. If you know you are at specific risk of deportation, you may consider additional steps, too, related to establishing an emergency guardian for children and a power of attorney for yourself.

Right now, everyone seems ready to throw down. More than ever, it's important to pick your battles—and know how to win.

Given that US citizens are not safe from violence or arrest at the hands of federal immigration agents, immigrants with an established status, visa, or permanent residency are potentially at even higher risk if they participate in community safety efforts or other activities that put them near immigration agents.

In December, DHS vehemently denied to WIRED that its agents engage in racial profiling as part of immigration operations. Multiple sources emphasized to WIRED, though, that nonwhite Americans should consider being extra cautious about proximity to immigration agents. This is particularly true in light of a September 2025 US Supreme Court decision in which Justice Brett Kavanaugh concluded that someone's apparent ethnicity may be a “relevant factor” that could justify detaining someone during an immigration enforcement action—something now derisively known as a “Kavanaugh stop.”

You should consider taking precautions to protect yourself against potential digital surveillance if you know you are going to be proximal to immigration authorities. CBP and ICE both have digital surveillance capabilities that are increasing all the time. You can't always anticipate when you might encounter federal agents, of course, but people who could specifically be the target of an immigration enforcement action should consider taking extra digital precautions if they can.

Looking broadly, sources told WIRED that political polarization and rising tensions across the US are key contexts in assessing potential risks.

“It's no longer Officer Friendly out there,” Whitlock says. “This is not to give any excuse, but I can imagine there is a mindset within the field ICE agents and CBP where they really do think they're under attack and being threatened. And no one is above the law, but I think it's important for people to understand that there are going to be limited forms of trying to hold these officers accountable in practice.”

If you find yourself witnessing an immigration enforcement action, there are some things to keep in mind if you want to stick around.

“The goal is to be an observer and to document what is happening,” says Nathan-Pineau of the Immigrant Legal Resource Center. “The goal is not to go and try to intervene in the law enforcement action.”

Training materials from Siembra NC, a North Carolina–based grassroots organization working to defend its local communities from exploitation, say that the priority when ICE is present is letting agents know they are being observed and reminding people of their right to remain silent, while deescalating whenever possible and promoting safety. The group advises that if ICE operatives are conducting an arrest or traffic stop, responders should try to approach within their line of sight and identify themselves in the process.

You can also report immigration enforcements sightings in many areas without getting involved by calling a local ICE watch tip line. Many immigration advocacy and human rights groups suggest using the “SALUTE” acronym to guide the information you give in these reports. Size: How many agents or officers you see. Activity: What are they doing? Has anyone been detained? Location: Where exactly did you see them and what direction are they heading in? Units: What types of officers are they or what words and markings can you see on their uniforms? Time: What time was the sighting? Make reports as quickly as possible. Equipment: What do the agents have with them, such as types of weapons, vehicles, crowd control methods, and other details?

Filming ICE behavior can let agents know they are being watched, potentially creating some accountability for their actions, as well as a digital evidence trail for any legal cases or proceedings that may occur at a later date. When interacting with federal agents as part of a group effort responding to ICE, Siembra NC recommends identifying yourself as a volunteer, and asking agents who they are, what they are doing, and what agency they work for. Then you can state that you will remain present to observe, while also recording any models of vehicles, license plates, and operatives at the scene.

“We always advise people that if the law enforcement officer that you are filming tells you to step back, you should step back and you should say it out loud—‘I'm stepping back, I'm stepping back.' That way you're recording that you're complying with their order,” Nathan-Pineau says.

Multiple sources reiterated that recording federal agents has a dual purpose, because if your own behavior and that of the people around you is appropriate to the situation, this will be captured in your documentation as well as any officer misconduct. The fact remains, though, that peacefully filming interactions can be interpreted as aggressive or escalatory precisely because it is an accountability mechanism.

Proximity is one of the most important risks to assess when on the scene, says Xavier de Janon, director of mass self-defense at the National Lawyers Guild. “The closer people have been to federal agents or property, the more likely they've been charged, tackled, or arrested,” he says.

More and more, federal prosecutors are seeking criminal charges against people for allegedly assaulting federal officers, even if the cases ultimately don't succeed and later get dropped. The NLG recently published a guide on how protesters and observers can assess risks related to the federal assault law.

Even if you can't risk hitting the streets, there are other important ways to contribute to community safety efforts.

Civil liberties groups have been campaigning nationwide to ban real-time surveillance platforms and end lucrative contracts that feed information to ICE. You can contact the offices of your local officials and tell them to cancel surveillance contracts and stop information-sharing and other law enforcement cooperation that fuels ICE operations.

“It's good that local officials in cities targeted by ICE are speaking out and condemning their brutal tactics—but talk is cheap,” says Evan Greer, director of the digital rights activist organization Fight for the Future. “ICE violence is enabled by ICE surveillance, often with help from local police and city-run surveillance systems. If local leaders want to protect their residents from ICE's gestapo tactics, one of the most immediate things they can do is roll back and limit surveillance by canceling contracts with surveillance vendors like Flock and banning the use of facial recognition and other forms of biometric surveillance, either through executive action or city ordinance.”

For those who are not direct targets of the federal immigration crackdown, Kathy O'Leary, a member of the Catholic peace organization New Jersey Pax Christi, recommends listening to neighbors who are directly affected and figuring out what they need. Every week, she and other volunteers go to Delaney Hall Detention Facility in New Jersey to support families who are visiting their loved ones in detention. The volunteers bring chairs and water for the visitors—who are forced to wait outside—and help visitors navigate the rules of the facility.

For example, she said, her group started bringing extra clothing because they realized that visitors were being turned away because of dress code violations. She said it started when a woman who had traveled all the way from Boston to visit her father in detention was turned away because she was wearing ripped jeans. A volunteer realized she was the same size and offered to switch pants.

“That was a serious act of resistance,” O'Leary says. “The system was creating a hurdle to see her father. The system tries to limit contact with families; it's about stealing people's hope and trying to break people.”

O'Leary and other volunteers also give out gift cards to grocery stores to visitors, since many families' breadwinners are the ones in detention. O'Leary says that people who want to figure out how to get involved in their communities can see if they live near a local member of the Detention Watch Network. If there isn't a member in their state, sometimes groups in neighboring states will know who's active in their area.

Working with local mutual aid organizations, food pantries, and other humanitarian support groups contributes to overall community strength and safety. And simply contributing to digital ICE watch trackers as you go about your regular activities can give others valuable information.

“It's about what lever matches your risk tolerance, matches the resources that are available to you,” says Matt Mitchell, CEO of the risk-mitigation firm Safety Sync Group. “Not everyone has the same privileges. Some people want to donate money, some people want to write letters, some people want to read up on what law enforcement and CBP and ICE can and can't do. Some people want to put their bodies in the space and assemble because that is our right, some people want to document. There are many different levels.”

Reid Hoffman doesn't do much in half measures. He cofounded LinkedIn, of course, and helped bankroll companies including Meta and Airbnb in their startup days. He has also fashioned himself, via books, podcasts, and other public appearances, as something of a public intellectual—a pro-capitalist philosopher who still insists that tech can be a force for good.

Most recently, Hoffman has emerged as one of Silicon Valley's most prominent defenders of artificial intelligence. His newest book, 2025's Superagency, makes the case that AI won't diminish human capacity but will instead amplify it. In our conversation for this week's episode of The Big Interview, Hoffman readily riffed on AI's utility for pretty much everything, whether you're looking for a research assistant or a second opinion on your blood work. Hoffman even relied on AI to make one of the most unconventional—and perhaps uncomfortable, depending on your view of AI-generated creativity—Christmas gifts I've heard of lately. (And no, he didn't get me one.)

Whatever you think of Hoffman's utopian views on AI, credit where due: He's also a very outspoken critic of President Trump—a rare trait in a tech world that's grown increasingly quiet, or cozy, when it comes to the cruelties of the US administration. Hoffman's overt political views haven't been without consequence: Trump has twice threatened to launch investigations into him, most recently calling on Attorney General Pam Bondi to dig into Hoffman's ties to Jeffrey Epstein. (In 2019, Hoffman apologized for his mid-2010s relationship with Epstein, which he says related solely to fundraising for MIT. He has subsequently called for the government to release the Epstein files in full.)

Despite those threats, Hoffman isn't pulling punches: When we sat down to tape this episode in mid-December, he readily called out the administration for degrading American government, criticized his peers for keeping their heads down, and urged Silicon Valley to stop pretending that neutrality is a virtue. If only more billionaires were saying it.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

KATIE DRUMMOND: Reid Hoffman, welcome to The Big Interview. So glad to have you here.

REID HOFFMAN: I'm glad to be here.

We like to start these conversations with some very fast questions. Little warm-up. Are you ready?

Great!

Voice memo or text message?

Text message.

Cooperative games or competitive games?

Cooperative games.

The biggest difference between you and Elon Musk?

Sanity.

What's the hardest lesson you've ever had to learn?

Oh gosh, there's a whole lot. Probably when to give up.

Who do you wish would run for president in 2028?

Sanity.

Sanity for president.

Yes, exactly. You know, it's funny, I probably can't give a good answer to that question. I mean, the people I would want to run for president probably won't.

Oh, that's too bad.

Yes.

You can't say their names?

Since I've tried to persuade them to do so, I think it's probably impolite.

I'm fascinated. Next time we talk, I'm going to force you to tell me. What is your one, personal, killer use case for AI?

Well, I just generated a holiday Christmas album as my Christmas gift for all my friends.

I assume they all know that it's AI generated music?

Yes. And it's on records. We put it on records.

So it's from your heart into the AI …

Yes.

… to their Christmas tree.

I've always had this desire to have Christmas music that has irony as well as affection for the holiday. So, there's a song on ugly sweaters and, you know, all of this kinda stuff. As opposed to the “holly, jolly Christmas,” you know, something that actually has some humor. Almost like what “Weird Al” Yankovic would do if he was doing a Christmas album.

Is that what you told the AI to do?

Yes, exactly. It's completely AI-generated. Actually, we did one model for the lyrics and another for generating the music and everything else to try to get the best of all things. By the way, it's stunning. My better half was listening to this and going, “Wait, that's not an actual singer?” I'm like, “Nope.”

Coming soon to WIRED: a leaked copy of Reid Hoffman's AI-generated holiday album.

Oh, I'm happy to send you it.

What is most exciting to you about 2026?

Well, there's a lot, but I would say primarily the amazement that we'll get with AI. So it's not just like Manas AI and trying to cure cancer through drug discovery, but also the Superagency book, and how it's giving us super powers. Obviously there's some things that are overhyped and won't be here soon, but what is there is amazing, and I think that's probably the most exciting thing, and maybe that's, unfortunately, too generic of an answer.

We'll get into AI in just a minute, but let me ask you one last question. You went to a private school where students did farm chores. I learned this about you getting ready for this show. Which was your favorite?

Well, the hardest one was called Winter Barn, which is you got up at 5 in the morning in Vermont and you trekked across the very cold hillscape and you shoveled manure from behind cows. So that was a grit and endurance test. And probably my favorite was actually driving oxen through the woods as part of the maple syrup farming.

That brings me to where I want to start. You were born in Palo Alto, right? You secretly applied to boarding schools for high school, which, now having a young daughter, I can't even imagine how I would react to that. You ended up at The Putney School in Vermont, a progressive high school, working on a farm, and you've said it really set you up in a big way. Tell us about that.

Putney is very unique, and part of the uniqueness is its theory of education as preparing you as a person. Most of these schools are all college prep, and you will have the right academics to prepare you for Stanford, Harvard, Yale, whatever, blah, blah, blah, blah. Putney's like, no, we try to create well-rounded people. You have a work job, even if you're paying full tuition. Every quarter, you must do some art. You have evening activities; I did blacksmithing, there's woodworking and poetry-writing and helping construct the magazine.

As part of each quarter you do a serious project, which is something you create. You break twice a year and go into various wilderness expeditions together. So I did canoeing and other kinds of things as part of this. And that full, rounded person is part of what I think is the gift that Putney gave me.

Now, it meant that when I started at Stanford, I was actually behind many of my friends and fellow students on actually learning academics. I had to learn because I hadn't done academics as intensively, and I had to learn much more intensively in my first year on that. I took advantage of a bunch of different things that Stanford had to offer. It was like, Oh, well, I'm doing this really intense math course, I'll get a tutor in order to kind of process these things.

That was essentially the setup. It gave you a kind of entrepreneurial thinking, because you weren't just like a cookie cutter, you know, learn the physics …

Take the SATs, test into a good college.

Exactly. It was a much broader spectrum, and so that helped me in thinking in a much broader spectrum and also helped me as a person getting ready for stuff.

One thing that's interesting to me is that you went to Oxford. You thought you may want to be an academic philosopher. Obviously, you did not do that. You decided to go into tech. Funnily enough, I also thought I might want to be an academic philosopher. I got a bachelor's in philosophy. Then I decided not to get a master's degree because I remember feeling like I didn't want to be sitting on a university campus for the next 40 years of my life.

But it did, I think, set me up very nicely for the career that I have now in ways that people might find unexpected. I'm curious for you, why did you make the move that you did? Why did you turn your back on academic philosophy, and what do you think that interest and that pursuit of philosophy gave you in the long term?

At Stanford, I did artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and this major called small systems. I was like, “We don't understand what thinking and language is, so maybe philosophy does.” I went to Oxford, studied philosophy to possibly do that, and part of my interest has always been human beings. How do we understand, you know, the world, each other, ourselves?

It's helped in a lot of ways. So it's helped in entrepreneurship. Part of what entrepreneurship is, is thinking about what the world might possibly be. This new product, this new service in a market with competitors and so forth, and thinking about that in a crisp way.

One of the things that I tell entrepreneurs, especially consumer internet entrepreneurs, is that they absolutely should have a theory of human nature. When you're creating a product that you hope to have a billion active users of, the way that that happens is you have a theory of human nature. Now, back in 2002, when I was trying to give talks at business schools and I was trying to wake them up on things, they would say, “Well, what's your secret of investing?” And they were expecting I would say, “Well, I analyze the customer acquisition cost, long-term value …” And I was like, “I invest in one or more of the seven deadly sins.”

Is that true?

Yes. It's a theory of human nature. Now, one of the things I've later updated is, yes, I invest in the seven deadly sins with the hope to transform them into human positivity.

When I was giving this talk, I think at Stanford in 2006 or something, someone said, “Well, what's Twitter?” And I said, “It's identity.” I misunderstood it. It's wrath. We have these deep psychological things, and you want to evolve them to our better selves. Someone said, “What's LinkedIn?” It's greed. But, of course, part of LinkedIn is trying to have your best economic amplification through working with the people you know and have worked with. That's the goal with LinkedIn; it isn't to sit around and be King Midas.

To think about these as human products, as ways of changing and evolving the human condition. Philosophy is very helpful for that.

Speaking of the human condition, I want to move us into AI. You are very open about being optimistic about artificial intelligence. Your latest book, Superagency, argues that AI is not replacing human agency, right? It is multiplying it. It is an intelligence multiplier. That's what you say. Give us a quick overview of how you got to that argument and exactly what you mean there.

So the first thing is: AI is not a naturally occurring phenomenon. We can shape it. Part of Superagency was bringing together what people were concerned about, which is the loss of agency, loss of control, loss of privacy, loss of economic engagement, et cetera, et cetera.

Then, obviously, you have the existential risk people, you know, loss of life or something else's ways of doing this. If you look at this in the history of technology, including the printing press, including electricity, this argument has come up each time as this kind of loss of agency, and we've shaped it to much more positive agency. So the whole thing is, as technologists, we should be shaping it to positive agency.

If you put something serious on the line and say, “Compose a Christmas album,” I would be dead. Right? There's no way I could do that, but I can do that with AI. It's kind of a superpower. I, of course, also use it for research and use it for, you know, amplifying my thinking and solving the blank pages and all the rest. But we get all these superpowers. One of the superpowers I recommend everybody to use frontier models for is for both doctors and patients. Any serious medical thing you have, use your choice of frontier model: ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, Gemini, whatever, as a second opinion. Right? Like that's a superpower.

I would vastly prefer for my doctor to handle that. The idea of having more medical information, for me personally, is terrifying. But maybe for someone else it would be a superpower.

But, by the way, I've had friends that do this: You get your blood tests and literally take a picture of the blood test, upload it to ChatGPT, and then have a conversation and get a dialog. It makes it much more interpretable and understandable. Then you can say, “Well, I'm worried about this thing that's showing up in red. Why is that? What does that mean, and what can I do about that? Should I take the blood test again?” This kind of stuff. You can already see it as an amplifier.

My push for people is if you are not using AI in a way today that isn't seriously helpful to you, you are not actually trying hard enough. Right? It doesn't mean that it does everything. For example, as an investor you can't say, “Make my investment decisions.” But you can say, “Give me the due diligence list on this.” It works very well.

Now, of course it'll transform jobs, and there'll be a bunch of pain in that transformation. But the way that you as an individual can avoid that is to be engaged; it's the best learning technology created in human history. It's better than the book. So use it in order to do that and as part of adapting to the future.

That's the essence of the argument, which is we've always had these concerns about agency when we have new technology. In every case so far, it's led to an amplification of human agency. We are able to shape it as technologists and builders and iterate in order to do that. That's what we should do.

One piece of that is this idea of the potential of this technology in the hands of billions of people, right? That's a very powerful idea. The idea of democratizing access to education or access to health information—those are very, very powerful concepts. But the practical part of me can't stop coming back to the idea that a lot has to happen for billions of people to have equitable access to technology. Do you worry that AI will concentrate that agency in the hands of fewer people, rather than distribute it? And how can that dynamic change?

Well, there's two things. One, mass market technology does tend to have very broad access. So your Uber driver has the same iPhone as Tim Cook has, right? So when you get to very, very broad, it's actually made the same for everybody. Like there isn't a wealthy person's cell phone. We all use the same cell phones now.

As far as we know.

Well, I think I might know, and I don't. So I have a credible statement here. Then the second thing is that by having multiple companies competing really ferociously, they are doing the work to get it to hundreds of millions of people. Next year will be billions. And you know, the vast majority of ChatGPT is free usage. The vast majority of Gemini is free usage. That means if you have access to the internet, you have a phone, you have a library computer, it is actually broadly usable.

Now, we do have wealth differentials in society. I don't know what society looks like without inequality. This is one of the things about the goal of equality; you want equality of opportunity and equality of talent engagement and so forth. But we run everything in society like there are people who compete for your job. There's people who compete for my job. Few people get those jobs, but you want to have everyone have the opportunity. For example, today you already have these agents being amongst the best tutors that you could possibly get. If you just put it in as a meta prompt—“don't give me the answer, walk me towards the answer”—you can actually have it as an educational tutor today.

I want to ask you about art. Listening to you talk about your early education and the idea of creating a whole person, you had this very multifaceted, very hands-on educational experience, and there is something so distinctly human about so much of that.

My mom was a poet, so I have the idea of my mother sitting down to write poetry as a craft. We are now talking about you using AI to create a Christmas record. I'm curious about how you grapple with the AI and art and creativity debate. Obviously, this is a very, very hot topic. Everybody has a different point of view on it, and it's very fraught. Art is very emotional for a lot of people. It's also their livelihood. How do you think about that?

I have no objections to someone who says art is something specifically created by humans, and you have to be using very old-school technology, like a paintbrush—that's still technology, by the way—and that's the only way that you can do this. I do have objections to people who say you're not allowed to use new technology to make art.

By the way, we've had in quasi-recent times this idea of Oh, photography can't be art. Only painting, because you learn the mechanics of doing this and so forth. So, you know, this debate has happened in various ways before.

I do think that AI is gonna transform a lot of art processes. I use AI intrinsically, for example, in writing books. People go, “Well, did you just give me a piece of writing that was completely, like, press a button and get it from AI? Or do you own it in some way? Did you shape it or craft it in some way?” Some people say, “I only wanna see things that have no AI touch.” And some people say, “I want to have it so that you actually typed every word, but you could be using AI as an editor.” I have the same views on art.

The technology will disrupt how movies are made. It will disrupt how music is made. People go, “Well, wait a minute. I put in all of this energy, and I got very specific in terms of a skillset in order to do this.” Now the skillset's changing relative to output production, given the use of this tool. But I think that's the nature of progress, and sure, it's difficult in the short term, but it's part of what's really good.

How have you wrestled with AI's acceleration versus its risks? I know that you have advocated for AI development to continue, not to be slowed down in unduly ways, but how do you think about the risk versus reward there?

If you said, “Hey, we're not gonna put a car on the road until we answer every risk,” you'd never get a car on the road. You have to put the car on the road. You have to drive it, you have to learn it. And by the way, you'll have some faults for that.

You invent the car, you invent the car accident. But what you do is you say, “What are the things you prevent in advance?” which are the limited subset of stuff that's really pretty catastrophic. Like, no, you can't have a car without a brake. You must put brakes in.

You do iterative deployment, you then go, “Oh, this is the thing we should fix, given what we've learned."" Some of it happens in the industry. Like, in the car, you add airbags. But some of it also happens through regulatory [measures]. Society goes, “I know there's no consumer demand for seat belts, but we know what the hospital outcomes are. We're gonna mandate seat belts.”

Well, sure. But how is the “mandating seat belts” part going in the AI regulation conversation?

Well, I'm not sure we're—look, I think we're just beginning to get to … I think one of the places that's most interesting in it, which is do you have your chatbots talking to children? Yes/no. If you have your chatbots talking to children, are you responsible in the way that that one should be responsible to children? Like, for example, questions around self-harm or other kinds of things, and what does that look like?

I think Anthropic is doing a good job of showing the way of saying, “Hey, look, we need to be really proactive about cybersecurity because this could be used for all kinds of cybercrime, and we're gonna be really proactive and everyone should be doing the kinds of stuff we're doing.”

You know, I was on the board of OpenAI for a while, so looking at GPT-3, GPT-4, GPT-5 in sequence, the toolset for them being aligned to human values, to human well-being, got richer as the models got better.

So that's the reason I'm broadly very positive. I fundamentally agreed with the Biden executive order on AI, which is, hey, have some transparency and reporting and a red-team plan and all the rest of the stuff. I think all that stuff is still gonna be there, despite the current administration's let's revoke everything that Biden possibly touched as totally bad and evil [stance], which is like a child's response. You obviously should be like, that part was good, that part was bad as opposed to revoke it all. That is just, clearly, incorrect.

You are a Democrat. You have been very politically outspoken in recent years. Are you worried that your political point of view right now is denying you a seat at the table when it comes to AI and AI regulation? What are you doing to make sure that your voice is a prominent one as this regulatory framework either does or does not take shape under this administration?

Well, my view about my voice at the table is I only come to the table when asked and try to be helpful. If I was asked by the current administration to try to help with what they think, I would do that.

You have not been asked.

I have not been. Then they claim that the previous administration is the same and it's very politically biased. I at least know that the previous administration would call people who disagreed with them and ask their point of view, minimally. What I try to do is do things like this: podcasts, media, writing books, advising people when they ask for advice.

I think part of what you try to do to contribute to society is you try to contribute your best possible work and perspectives and try to gather people around those to maximize the chance that it has an impact. That's the best you can do.

You are a billionaire in politics, and you frame that engagement as a way to strengthen democracy. I'm curious about when that value became personal for you, when it felt like a personal imperative as opposed to an intellectual idea.

One of my criticisms about the underlying libertarianism in American culture is that I believe—call it Spider-Man ethics or Voltaire ethics—with power comes responsibility. If you make a bunch of money or you inherit a bunch of money, that's an investment from society.

I'm a believer in the capitalist system. I'm a believer in the fact that we set out goals for people to contribute to society and then get rewarded from that. You know, all systems are imperfect. So it doesn't mean it's perfect, but you know that, as a broad-based system, it's good. Now, that being said, I think with power, when you get power in one form, power is money. Another form of power is the media. Another form of power is government, and with that comes responsibility.

The responsibility is not just to yourself but to society and to humanity. I started serving on nonprofit boards very early in my career. If any government official asked me for something, I would try to help in terms of advice.

What I think we're seeing is the general decay of the American government, and American society, through the current administration. At the beginning of [2024], I said, “Hey, I anticipate I'll get political persecution, calls for the DOJ to investigate me from social media, Truth Social, et cetera.” But there's also many different things. It's like, you know, if you said, “Hey, we're living in a society where masked people are pulling people off the streets and putting them in vans and putting them in something that can be characterized as a camp.” Those are degradations of society.

That's the reason why with Trump's [first] election I really started leaning in. Now I'm gonna try to work on society, because I think that's one of the places where responsibility comes in for those who have power.

The narrative around Silicon Valley in the last year has not been politically generous, at least from the media, and I include WIRED in that assessment. Steven Levy wrote what I thought was a tremendous cover story for us several months ago about this.

I agree.

A lot of your peers have been very quiet about [all this], if not downright cozy, with the administration. How do you understand this change in Silicon Valley? How does it read and look to you?

Obviously it's always a challenge when you say all Silicon Valley.

The media has a way with simplifying narratives.

Yeah. But let me break it down into some groups. The broad collective belief in Silicon Valley is that a super important way to make change in the world is building technology companies that build the next products and services at scale. It's one of the levers that changes things.

Arguments for that are like what I'm doing with Manas AI in terms of trying to cure cancer and so forth. That's a religion that I think everyone, or the vast majority of people, actually believe in a strong, strong way.

But within that there's different groups. There's one group that's totally motivated by primarily making money, right? Then there's people who have a strong belief in the technology of cryptocurrency. Where the Biden administration was essentially declaring war on cryptocurrency and was unbanking cryptocurrency—just applying regulatory pressure versus having a regulatory regime and following it and so forth. So [those cryptocurrency advocates] were pro-MAGA. There's a group of people who believe that the Democrats are overly captured by Palestinian interests and would be against the state of Israel. So they're in the kind of pro-MAGA group. Then there's also the pure opportunists for power. Like, oh, it's our turn to eat.

Now, I think there's a bunch of people in Silicon Valley who disagree with [the administration], but they're like, “Well, look, if I speak up or do things, then I am challenging my company. I'm gonna get hostile retaliation, I'll get a regulatory thing that's discriminatory just attacking me as a political enemy versus the thing I'm doing, and I'm trying to do this thing that's good for humanity” and so forth.

Of course I get messages from people saying, “You should be quiet. You should keep your head down.” One of the things to think about, when you feel fear, is the opportunity for courage. The fact that you feel fear about speaking what you think is true about who we should be as Silicon Valley or as Americans—that's precisely the degradation of American society. That's precisely the opportunity for courage.

What I'm hopeful for in '26 is for more people speaking up. Speaking truth to power is the point of freedom of speech, is the point of American society. I think that there's a bunch of different factions in the Valley that have been keeping their head down out of this fear of retaliation under a rationalization of: “Hey, my contribution is to build this new company.”

The way that ICE is operating is terrible for people. Tariffs are terrible for people. Anti-vaccination is terrible for children's health. Just speak up about the things that you think are true. Do that and do not let fear and intimidation and hostility, the weaponization of the artifacts of state, quiet you.

You talked a minute ago about fear, and I couldn't agree more. It's something that we talk about as a newsroom at WIRED all the time, and especially in the last year. Are you fearful? You are a prominent person. You are a very wealthy person. You work in this industry. Do you worry about this? Trump ordered an investigation into you.

Twice!

I'm referring to the Epstein situation.

There was the one before, which was this fictional organization of antifa, which I only know from right-wing media invention.

I am also unfamiliar with the organization of antifa. I can't say I'm familiar. But we're talking about the president of the United States here. We're talking about someone who has clearly demonstrated an appetite for retaliation. Does that scare you?

I'm rational. So fear and concern are part of the reaction. But when you feel fear, you have to evaluate and decide what that means for you. What it means for me is: Look, if I'm not willing to stand up, how can I ask other people to stand up against the fear and intimidation that the administration is trying to practice?

I'm sure there's a whole bunch of people that are in the red, MAGA ecosystem that go, “Oh yeah, I've heard of this Reid Hoffman guy, isn't he just a criminal?” because Trump called for an investigation. Trump also called for an indictment of [James] Comey, which was legitimately thrown out. It's precisely the staying silent that allows the bad stuff to happen. It's like the Germans who stayed silent in Nazi Germany. People say, “Well, yeah, that's wrong …” and they tell themselves rationalizations.

Could never happen again …

Yeah, and “it doesn't really mean anything,” and “he's just being political.” Look, that's precisely the thing that degrades our society, that degrades our democracy, that degrades our rule of law. Speak up.

We're speaking during the week of December 15, and the president has, in theory, a deadline of this Friday to release all of the Epstein files. Now, you have called for those files to be released. You've been very public about that. Obviously, you were tied up in this. You've spoken about it. When you pushed to have all of these files released, all of the intelligence released that the Justice Department has on Epstein, why is it important to you that it all comes out? What do you think it means for the president, assuming more information is released?

I had a small number of interactions [with Epstein], as you know, fundraising for MIT, and have apologized for that. Once I realized what was involved in that, I was like, “Oh shit, this is terrible. I'm really sorry.”

I didn't even know who Epstein was in the whole, like when he was put in prison and released as a registered sex offender and so forth. It was all political attacking. But I didn't speak up about that, because what I concluded is that the thing that's most important is first and foremost justice for the victims, right?

Then, of course, this year it goes to “oh, we're trying to defend our own misdeeds by trying to portray Epstein as a Democrat, and it's all these Democrats' fault,” when [the administration] themselves had campaigned vigorously on releasing all the Epstein files.

So I was like, “Look, you guys have the Epstein files. You're gonna use this as a slander tactic for politics and further harm the victims. The simplest way to give justice to the victims is to release all the files. Show everyone what the truth is. I think that's part of the reason why I was driven to speak up about this. Because despite the fact that the first and foremost important thing always is the victims, the question is, if you're gonna try to politicize this, then simply live in truth.

Sure. The more information that's out there, the better.

Yeah.

Let me pivot a little bit to talking about the future for a few minutes. You've done a lot. You do a lot. What do you still want to do? What is on your bucket list that, at this point in your career, you feel like you have not yet crossed off?

I do think we are alive at one of the most amazing times to be alive. Maybe the most, with AI and all the rest.

This is going to bring some great early January optimism to our listeners here.

That's part of the reason I cofounded Manas AI with Siddhartha Mukherjee, to tackle cancer, to tackle a whole bunch of different diseases.

I think about the fact that we'll all have a medical assistant, an educational assistant, a legal assistant, that is essentially available to everybody. It's a line of sight to making this happen, and we just have to sort out some regulatory and other kinds of issues for this.

I wanna help with that. I want to help with navigating. The first reaction to technology in all human history is fear. To embrace it as pro-agency, both in terms of what we build but also in terms of how we understand it and how we do it. There's a reason I tell everyone to start using it.

I have this thing. It's basically humanity, then society, then industry. So part of it is, helping humanity and society I think is a lifetime goal, all the way to when I'm moving around on my walker. Then, obviously, participating in the industry stuff in various ways because I do think industry can be a very good way to do this.

Well, then let me ask you this, which bucket—humanity, society, industry—does AI fall into?

All.

Now, before we wrap up, we're gonna play a very quick game. The game is called Control, Alt, Delete. It's how we wrap up every show. I want to know what piece of technology you would love to control, what piece would you love to alter, or change, and what piece you would love to delete, or vanquish from the earth.

Do you want one answer for each? Two answers for each?

One. Let's be disciplined.

Control social media for kids.

OK.

One of the things that most of the world doesn't really understand is Silicon Valley is also broadly in line with this. If you have kids engaging with this, it should be in ways that have the kind of protections that we generally have for kids, including parental involvement and so forth. So, I'd control social media for kids.

Great.

Alter, I think it's like let's go shape AI, right? We want it to be American intelligence. We want it to be embodying the views that we aspire to as Americans in terms of empowerment and freedom and economic prosperity.

Then, delete. It's very hard for me to delete a technology versus just shape it, like there's a lot more to alter. I think that we want to be thinking about our collective media systems and how we learn collectively. So how do we have disinformation being weeded out by the operation of the system in terms of people learning collectively? Vaccine misinformation is the example that I most often give. So, for example, if I could delete disinformation at scale, I would do that. But it has to be through a collective learning process.

Well, I think for the sake of the game you can say you want to delete misinformation.

Yes.

Let's do it. Let's Delete it. Reid Hoffman, thank you so much. Such a thoughtful conversation. I really appreciate it.

I look forward to the next.

7/10

The Hi-Fi industry seems to be in a state of constant, somewhat unnecessary evolution; if Guglielmo Marconi was inventing the radio today it would almost certainly come in five different colorways, dripped out over a few years as though they were new products. Still, the past 20 years—with the invention of Bluetooth, music streaming, and mass adoption of voice control speakers—has fundamentally changed what many people think of as home audio.

All-in-one streaming smart speakers are ridiculously convenient. But what about the millions of old analogue amplifiers and passive speakers that still sound great? The Bowers & Wilkins bookshelf speakers you bought 20 years ago remain phenomenal, they're just not as smart. New Swedish startup Atonemo would like to change that with their small, unassuming Streamplayer.

Rating: 7/10

Measuring a matchbox-sized 1.97 x 2.76 x 0.73 inches, the Streamplayer is a very simple device designed to give streaming capabilities to any existing speaker. It supports AirPlay 2, has Chromecast built-in, Spotify Connect and Tidal Connect, and can offer playback in a respectable 24-bit/192 kHz high resolution. There's no display, a single clicky button, and output options are via one 3.5mm jack either as analog or optical S/PDIF. That's it.

Power comes via USB-C, and once you've synched everything up with the Atonemo app, linked it to your Wi-Fi, and plugged the supplied 3.5mm jack into an amplifier or active speaker, you can then stream audio to it from pretty much any platform. It took me three minutes to turn a verging-on-vintage Vita Audio R1 Mk1 (what is now Ruark Audio) into a Tidal streaming delight. The app is mercifully stripped back, and the software feels nimble, and is a whole lot more responsive than using Sonos.

Much of the success of “smart” audio products has been based on convenience, rather than audio quality. Despite having access to more hi-fi kit than is strictly healthy, I still struggle with the quality vs. convenience of it all: There's a $45 Echo Spot in my kitchen, but I have a $1,400 Audiolab M-DAC+ headphone amp in the office. Both work brilliantly, one actually sounds good.

The Streamplayer does its best to straddle both these worlds. The team at Atonemo has chosen an integrated DAC from Realtek's SoC (system-on-chip) range. This chip is a mass-market option, but can still handle 24-bit / 192 kHz resolution. It's a world away from high-end standalone DAC chips (like ESS, Cirrus Logic or AKM) but at $99, to expect audiophile levels of DSP (digital signal processing) would be a bit much. It is convenient though.

Aside from Bluetooth streaming is Wi-Fi 6 dual-band 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz (802.11ax) with WPA2 and WPA3 security. It's a pretty solid offering for a cheap box of tricks and the brand also promises over-the-air firmware updates.

Plugged into my father's 20-year-old Arcam amplifier, powering a pair of equally vintage Mordaunt Short floorstanding speakers, the Streamplayer works smoothly. It did require a 3.5mm to RCA cable (more in this below) but dad's box of old cables is a tech treasure trove. On first listen I was impressed by the ease of it all, and switching between Qobuz and Spotify Lossless certainly didn't offend. But when playing the same song side-by-side using a mid-range Cambridge Audio CD player, the difference was obvious.

Playing the album “Music from Big Pink” by The Band, and the power and scale from the CD version easily eclipsed that of the Streamplayer. Rick Danko's bass lines soared and the layering of the instruments was wonderfully pronounced via CD, while they were noticeably subdued when streaming. Same speakers, same amplifier, very different DACs.

It's by no means a disaster, and the streaming convenience—in lieu of a large CD collection—is difficult to argue with. Even with quality components, the performance is only ever going to be as good as the audio quality played.

Atonemo makes a big deal over being able to power “all” legacy speakers. Included in the box is a single 3.5mm to 3.5mm audio jack, giving the ability to plug into active speakers, old radios, cassette players, boomboxes, and anything with a 3.5mm aux-in port.

But to power analogue speakers, you will need a separate amplifier and alternative cables, whether that's a 3.5mm to RCA or SPDIF RCA to 3.5mm jack cable. Atonemo told WIRED they toyed with the idea of including multiple cables in the box, but opted for the 3.5mm audio jack because most hi-fi people would have one already. They also plan to sell a range of cables to suit “all” legacy speakers. I think including a couple of cable options would have been a good idea, especially at launch, just to avoid any friction points with first-time installation, as not everyone has a box of old cables as comprehensive as my Dad.

Atonemo isn't the only option when it comes to breathing new life into older hi-fi components. The WiiM Mini Music Streamer ($89) is cheaper, offers AirPlay/Chromecast/Spotify Connect streaming capabilities and a XX DAC. Similarly the FiiO SR11 Desktop Streaming Music Receiver ($110) also copes with Apple Music, Spotify, Tidal, FiiO Music and PCM 768 kHz/32 Bit and DSD256 (DOP) quality. And for a further boost in audio quality plus one of the finest hi-res streaming multiroom platforms, the $379 Bluesound Node nano streamer is hard to ignore. There are also plenty of basic Bluetooth dongles available too if audio quality, or the ability to enjoy multi-room audio, isn't important to you.

But what Atonemo has done well is remove any technical barriers to use. The app is incredibly simple—in a good way—with no bloat, or pretence it is doing anything other than facilitating streaming between your old speakers and a modern streaming platform.

Yes, it could (and probably should) squeeze in a better DAC, and a more comprehensive collection of cables, but these are deliberate omissions, not glaring mistakes. Anyone looking to tweak and tune, and generally nerd-out about bit rates, are already well served elsewhere.

More than two dozen Immigration and Customs Enforcement vehicles on the ground in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area “currently lack the necessary emergency lights and sirens” required to be “compliant with law enforcement requirements,” according to a contract justification published in a federal register on Tuesday.

The document justifies ICE paying Whelen Engineering Company, a Connecticut-based firm specializing in “emergency warning and lighting technology,” $47,330.49 for 31 “ATLAS1” kits—seemingly a typo of ATLAS, the name of the product sold by Whelen—which the company's website describes as an “Adaptable Travel Light and Siren Kit.” The document explains that the ATLAS kits would “allow vehicles to be immediately operational and compliant with law enforcement requirements to support the current surge operation” out of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI)'s St. Paul office, which conducts operations in Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota.

“These vehicles were deployed prior to being permanently retrofitted and currently lack the necessary emergency lights and sirens required for operational use,” the document says.

The document also says that because of the “the time-sensitive nature of the mission” that HSI agents are conducting, having to wait for “permanent retrofitting” of the agency's vehicles with lights and sirens “would negatively impact operational readiness, law enforcement officer safety, and public safety.”

HSI's most recent public handbook for agents conducting “emergency driving”—defined as driving during “official duties,” like low- or high-risk pursuits, that may require breaking speed limits or violating certain traffic laws—appears to have been published in 2012. It says that any HSI vehicles without lights and sirens “may not be used” in emergency driving, unless the officer “is conducting surveillance or is responding to an event that may adversely impact or threaten life, health, or property or requires an immediate law enforcement response.”

The handbook adds that if an HSI officer is emergency driving but their vehicle does not have lights or sirens, they “must terminate” their participation in a law enforcement operation, and an officer from another law enforcement agency that does have lights and sirens should take over. This HSI officer ”may continue to assist in a backup role, if necessary.”

The handbook does not specify the exact number or location of lights that have to be on an emergency vehicle, but it says that officers are responsible for reviewing any state statutes for emergency lights and sirens where they operate. Minnesota state law requires law enforcement and emergency drivers to “sound an audible signal by siren” and have at least one red light on the front of the vehicle, among other stipulations.

ICE did not immediately respond to WIRED's request for comment.

According to Whelen's website, the ATLAS kit includes several items that are also sold separately by the company, including lightheads and lightbars, as well as a siren amplifier and speaker. The kit comes in a portable case resembling a wheeled suitcase, and it includes a small device with a microphone and buttons for controlling the other items in the kit. Whelen describes ATLAS as being “designed for quick installation” on any vehicle, regardless of make or model, and ideal for “on-the-go law enforcement.”

The listing comes six days after ICE officer Jonathan Ross fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in her car in Minneapolis, sparking massive protests and an influx of right-wing influencers trying to capitalize on the chaos. After Department of Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem announced that hundreds of additional ICE officers would join the 2,000 already in the Minneapolis area, the state of Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul filed a federal lawsuit against DHS and its top officials, asking the judge to halt the federal immigration enforcement operation underway in the state.

In sworn testimony that Ross gave in federal court last December, in connection to an incident in which he was injured while attempting to arrest an individual named Roberto Carlos Muñoz-Guatemala for possible deportation, he made several mentions of his unmarked vehicle, which he used to trail Muñoz-Guatemala prior to the incident.

For instance, Ross explained that he drove a “gold Chevy Tahoe,” which he said is a formal ""law enforcement vehicle."" He said the car was “unmarked” and designed to look like a regular vehicle driven by a civilian, but had lights on the grill, upper visor, and back window, in the side-rear area, and inside the headlights and taillights.

Bernardo Medellin, a special agent for the FBI, also testified last month in the same case that on the day Ross was injured, he was assisting ICE and driving a “bureau-owned” white Nissan Rogue with flashing red and blue police lights on the front grill, top windshield, and rear.

Updated 12:10 pm ET, January 13, 2026, to amend details regarding Ross' and Medellin's December testimony.

Microsoft said on Tuesday that it would be taking a series of steps toward becoming a “good neighbor” in communities where it is building data centers—including promising to ask public utilities to set higher electricity rates for data centers.

Speaking onstage at an event in Great Falls, Virginia, Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith directly referenced a growing national pushback to data centers, describing it as creating “a moment in time when we need to listen, and we need to address these concerns head-on.”

“When I visit communities around the country, people have questions—pointed questions. They even have concerns,” Smith said, as a slide showed headlines from various news outlets about opposition to data centers. “They are the type of questions that we need to heed … We are at a moment of time when people have a lot on their mind. They worry about the price of electricity. They wonder what this big data center will mean to their water supply. They look at this technology and ask, What will it mean for the jobs of the future? What will it mean for the adults of today? What will it mean for their children?”

The announcement follows a post from President Donald Trump on Truth Social on Monday in which he pledged that his administration would work with “major American Technology Companies,” including Microsoft, to make sure that data centers don't inflate customer utility bills.

“We are the ‘HOTTEST' Country in the World, and Number One in AI,” Trump wrote in the post, in which he also accused Democrats of being responsible for the rise in utility bills. “Data Centers are key to that boom, and keeping Americans FREE and SECURE but, the big Technology Companies who build them must ‘pay their own way.'”

Average electricity bills have risen faster than inflation in recent years in many parts of the country. These price hikes are due to a variety of factors, including the costs of repairing and maintaining the country's aging electric grid. But higher demand for electricity—including from data centers, which can also be expensive to connect to the grid—plays a role. As technology companies and utilities are predicting a massive new need for energy from the nationwide data center build-out, the Energy Information Administration projects that electric bills will keep increasing through 2026.

Concerns around data centers and electricity bills played a key role in several local and state midterm elections last year, while research released last fall shows that local opposition to data centers skyrocketed in the second quarter of 2025, leading to billions of dollars in projects stalled or canceled. The political divide against data centers appears to be bipartisan. In recent months, influential former Trump strategist Steve Bannon has begun speaking against the energy and water costs of data centers on his War Room podcast, part of a larger pushback from some MAGA figureheads against the AI build-out in the US.

The Trump administration, by contrast, has made expediting the data center build-out in the US a key priority. It removed a variety of environmental protections for data centers, including water protections, expedited the review of chemicals involved in their use, and encouraged their development on federal land. The Department of Energy has also instructed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees interstate transmission, to work on a suite of issues around data centers and the grid.

Microsoft, which has around 100 data centers planned or under construction across the country, has met with some local pushback to some of its projects. In October, the company canceled plans for a data center in Wisconsin due to local opposition; the group leading the charge against that project warned of a potential “5 to 15 percent rate hike to subsidize cheap power.” The company revealed last week that it was also behind a proposed project in Michigan, which was put on hold in December following concerns from community members. Hundreds of residents attended a planning commission meeting for the project Monday night, with many telling local media they were there to express opposition.

During the Tuesday announcement, Smith also said the company would reduce its water use in data centers and “replenish more of your water than we will use.” Concerns around data centers and water use have recently gotten public pushback from the industry, including its allies in the administration. In December, White House AI czar David Sacks shared a tweet from Andy Masley, the head of an effective altruist organization in Washington, DC, whose Substack posts casting doubt on the environmental impacts of AI have gained popularity. “The claim that AI data centers consume a large amount of water is a hoax,” Sacks wrote.

Other pledges the company made Tuesday include promises to add jobs to communities, commitments to not ask for tax abatements from local governments, and pledges to invest in local AI training.

Since their arrival in earnest in early 2024, AI PCs have yet to capture the imagination of consumers.

Even though PCs with AI embedded in their hardware components are expected to hit 77.8 million units in 2025, about 31% of the global market, and to garner 50% of the market in 2026, the computers have failed to drive end-user demand.

Dell Technologies executives acknowledged this at CES 2026, noting that the broad push to sell AI-integrated PCs to consumers had largely failed to resonate. Head of Product Kevin Terwilliger confessed that consumers are not buying PCs based on AI and that the branding likely caused more confusion than sales.

Meanwhile, Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke talked about the “unmet promise of AI,” noting that Dell's expectation of AI driving end-user demand “hasn't quite been what we thought it was going to be a year ago.”

“There was a rush to sell a technology that no one was sure they wanted,” explained HP Newquist, executive director of The Relayer Group, a business consulting company in New York City.

“The rush to add AI to these products was like a bunch of cereal companies deciding to add more fiber to their products or laundry detergent becoming new and improved with extra white cleaning power,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“There was no understanding on the part of the general public and even in the corporate user market what ‘AI Inside' a PC meant,” he said.

“There was no consumer demand, no urgent need on the part of users to have something that was specifically labeled with AI when it was available for free on the web anytime they wanted it,” he added.

When neural processing units (NPUs) started appearing in Windows laptops, they were billed as a way to enhance inference processing for AI in a way that's energy efficient, explained Brian Jackson, principal research director for the Info-Tech Research Group, a global IT research and advisory company. Their performance is measured in trillions of operations per second (TOPS).

“The idea was that [end users] would want these NPUs to enhance their AI performance,” he told TechNewsWorld. “But that just hasn't panned out.”

He explained that when the initial NPUs were launched in 2024, they were perceived as immediately underpowered. Microsoft issued a recommendation that at least 40 TOPS was required to support its Copilot features, but the available NPUs offered only 11 TOPS, so consumers felt the new hardware was obsolete as soon as it arrived.

“More recent launches in 2025 did address this with newer NPU components on Intel or Qualcomm processors meeting or exceeding that recommendation, but it didn't get off on the right foot,” Jackson said.

There was also no real killer application that required an NPU, he continued. “The chips only improve the energy performance of AI inference,” he explained. “Laptops with a GPU or a CPU can handle the inference for AI, they just do it slightly more slowly or at a greater cost to battery life.”

Also, the onboard NPU is only beneficial if you are running the inference on your local machine, and a lot of AI inference is taking place in the cloud right now, he added. “When I've seen PC makers demo this, they struggle to show off compelling examples of features that would get people excited,” he noted. “For example, one feature is better AI backgrounds on your video for Zoom calls, but people are already using features like this and probably feel like it's good enough.”

Unfortunately, AI on PCs has been positioned as transformative, but users have not felt a clear before-and-after moment, observed Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst at SmartTech Research, a technology advisory firm in Las Vegas. “Most AI features feel incremental or invisible compared to the cloud tools people already use,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Without a killer local use case, consumers default to price, battery life, and performance.”

“When Jeff Clarke talks about unmet promise, he is presumably pointing to the gap between marketing and real value,” he added. “AI was sold as personal, proactive, and productivity-changing. In reality, most AI features still feel experimental or redundant. The promise was magic. The delivery has been utility. There's where the gap exists.”

Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst at the Enderle Group, an advisory services firm in Bend, Ore., agreed that the dearth of AI-specific applications has affected unit sales. “Microsoft launched with two apps — Recall and Cocreator,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Recall was immediately pulled back due to privacy concerns, and no one really uses Cocreator. Why buy a technology that doesn't seem to do anything?”

He also pointed out that Qualcomm AI PCs, which were the only ones that worked at launch, had significant driver and software compatibility issues. “So you not only weren't getting something useful, you were getting a number of potentially annoying problems,” he said.

AI has not really pushed consumers to buy new PCs because there is no obvious, day-one benefit they can feel, contended Kaveh Vahdat, founder and president of RiseOpp, a marketing agency specializing in chief marketing officer services, in San Francisco.

“People still shop based on things they understand immediately, like battery life, performance, weight, and price,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Most AI features on PCs are either subtle, hard to explain, or already available through tools like ChatGPT or Gemini in the browser. That is why the promise feels underwhelming.”

“It is not that AI does not work,” he said. “It just has not given people a strong reason to replace a device that already does the job.”

Vahdat added that cloud AI tools have also changed how people think about AI.

“They taught users to expect AI to live in software and work across devices,” he explained. “When the best AI experience follows you from your phone to your browser to your laptop, it becomes much harder for a specific piece of hardware to stand out. In that situation, Copilot feels more like a delivery layer than a must-have hardware feature unless on-device AI is clearly faster, more secure, or meaningfully different from what runs in the cloud.”

Consumers aren't the only ones who lack interest in AI PCs. Enterprises, too, have been slow to embrace the hardware. “Enterprise buyers are reluctant to jump on the AI PC bus because the ROI remains unclear, and compelling use cases haven't fully materialized. There are also IT-security concerns,” explained Greg Sterling, co-founder of Near Media, a market research firm in San Francisco.

“AI PC adoption was likely hurt by overselling abstract ‘AI-ready' capabilities, which were too abstract for the enterprise, given myriad competing concerns about security, governance, and software compatibility,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“Enterprises are privacy-savvy and understand the significant risks inherent to AI services, including but not limited to privacy issues and the risk of hallucinations,” added Kirk Sigmon, an intellectual property lawyer with Banner Witcoff in Washington, D.C.

“That remains the case whether or not the AI services are provided locally — as part of an AI PC — or remotely — as part of some website or app,” he told TechNewsWorld.

Sigmon added that if an organization is buying new hardware, whether it's useful for AI is a lower priority relative to other concerns, such as price, compatibility with existing enterprise architecture, and ease of servicing.

“One day, all PCs will be AI PCs, just as all laptops became thin and light laptops or ultrabooks,” predicted Ross Rubin, the principal analyst at Reticle Research, a consumer technology advisory firm in New York City.

“AI PC is just one of these transitional labels that serves a purpose today to build awareness that increasingly your PC will be able to do more on your behalf, understand you better,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Eventually, we'll take the AI in a PC for granted.”

Meanwhile, the road ahead for AI PCs may still be rocky. “With ongoing component shortages expected to drive up the cost of PCs throughout 2026, I don't see demand for AI PCs improving,” said Kristen Hanich, director of research at Parks Associates, a market research and consulting company specializing in consumer technology products, in Dallas.

“Consumers are likely to hold onto their existing machines for longer and remain on Windows 10, buy less expensive replacements if they do decide to move to Windows 11, or move to operating systems that have lower hardware requirements and less or no integrated AI,” she told TechNewsWorld.

                                What happens here matters everywhere                                


by Todd Bishop on Jan 13, 2026 at 5:31 amJanuary 13, 2026 at 9:21 am

President Trump was right about Microsoft — but he only leaked part of the story.

Microsoft is changing its approach to building massive data centers for artificial intelligence, unveiling what it calls a “community first” initiative in response to growing opposition from people across the country facing higher electricity bills and dwindling water supplies.

The new plan, announced Tuesday morning in Washington, D.C, includes pledges to pay the company's full power costs, reject local property tax breaks, replenish more water than it uses, train local workers, and invest in AI education and community programs.

“This sector worked one way in the past, and needs to work in some different ways going forward,” said Brad Smith, Microsoft president and vice chair, in an interview with GeekWire. He later described the shift as “both the right thing to do and the smart thing to do.”

Trump made headlines Monday night with a Truth Social post in advance of the news, saying his administration has been working with tech companies “to secure their commitment to the American People.” He called Microsoft “first up” and said it would “make major changes … to ensure that Americans don't ‘pick up the tab' for their POWER consumption.”

Microsoft's rollout comes at a critical juncture for tech. 

Amazon, Google, OpenAI, Microsoft and others are betting hundreds of billions of dollars on AI, but those ambitions hinge on their ability to build out the infrastructure to support them — a prospect that depends increasingly on the cooperation of local communities that have grown skeptical of the costs and tradeoffs.

Smith said Microsoft has been developing its initiative since September. He described it as a response to shifting public sentiment — which he witnessed firsthand during visits to his home state of Wisconsin for Microsoft's data center expansion. Back in 2024, local residents wanted to talk about jobs. By last October, the big topics were electricity prices and water use.

“We saw this catch fire, to a degree, for many other companies in many other places around the country as each month unfolded,” he said. 

In data‑center hubs such as Virginia, Illinois and Ohio, residential power prices jumped 12–16% over the past year — noticeably faster than the U.S. average, according to U.S. government data — as grid operators scrambled to add capacity for large new facilities.

The issue has drawn scrutiny on Capitol Hill. Last month, three Democratic senators launched an investigation into whether tech giants are raising residential power bills, sending letters to Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Meta. An Amazon-funded study found that the company more than covers the utility costs associated with its electricity use in some regions.

Microsoft's new approach, as outlined in a post by Smith, is a clear departure from its own past practices. The company has accepted tax abatements for data centers in states including Ohio and Iowa, and its identity was kept under wraps in a Michigan township until recently.

In the interview, Smith promised new levels of transparency. 

He acknowledged that the traditional approach in the industry was for companies to buy land under nondisclosure agreements to avoid driving up prices — giving them a competitive edge but leaving communities in the dark about who was moving in and how they would operate.

“That is clearly not the path that's going to take us forward,” he said. The companies that succeed with data centers in the long run, he added, “will be the companies that have a strong and healthy relationship with local communities.”

Asked if Microsoft hopes to inspire or compel others to follow suit, Smith stopped short of positioning Microsoft as the sole leader, crediting Amazon for “really good and well-executed work in this space” while adding that “the industry is going to need to set a higher bar for itself.”

Microsoft's plan starts by addressing the electricity issue, pledging to work with utilities and regulators to ensure its electricity costs aren't passed on to residential customers. Smith cited a new “Very Large Customers” rate structure in Wisconsin as a model, where data centers pay the full cost of the power they use, including grid upgrades required to support them.

The company's other commitments include:

Microsoft did not say how much it plans to spend on these new initiatives, separate from its broader capital expenditures, which approached $35 billion in its first fiscal quarter. 

Asked if the company would truly be able to follow through on all of these commitments, Smith said, “we have to follow through.” Internally, he said, Microsoft is “bringing some groups together” and “adding resources” to execute the plan, describing it as essential to the company's long-term business strategy.

As for how Microsoft's position squares with OpenAI's push for federal incentives to support large-scale AI infrastructure projects, Smith drew a distinction. He said he supports federal help with permitting and land access, but not electricity subsidies.

“When it comes to things like electricity prices, when it comes to the water system, when it comes to training for local jobs, these are local issues,” he said.

Smith's post references the Trump administration's AI Action Plan and pledges to work with the Department of Labor on workforce programs. Microsoft says it will announce specific community partnerships during the first week of July, timed to America's 250th anniversary.

— Jon Pollock is now chief product officer of Acumatica, the Bellevue, Wash.-based enterprise software giant that was acquired last year by Vista Equity Partners.

Pollock joins Acumatica from childcare management software company Procare Solutions, where he was CPO and general manager of Procare's ChildPlus division. He previously held leadership roles with Worldpay, Asurion, Dell, Polaroid and others.

“Jon has the experience, vision, and strong track record of leading dynamic teams to execute our product strategy and empower the people who use our software every day,” John Case, CEO of Acumatica, said in a statement.

Case succeeds Ali Jani, who was with the company for 16 years. Early in his career, Jani co-founded a PC manufacturing startup and a company providing software for business management operations.

— Mo Malakoutian is now the mayor of the City of Bellevue. Malakoutian joined the Bellevue City Council in 2023, was elected by his colleagues to serve as deputy mayor beginning in 2024, and was chosen as mayor this month.

Malakoutian previously worked at Amazon for more than eight years, leaving the role of senior manager of learning and development in October. He is currently the executive director of the University of Washington's Consulting and Business Development Center with the Foster School of Business. 

Malakoutian replaces Lynne Robinson, who was mayor since 2020. She remains on the Bellevue City Council.

City councilmember Dave Hamilton was appointed deputy mayor of Bellevue.

— Software engineering leader David Bettis is leaving Amazon after two decades. Bettis was most recently with Amazon Web Services, including roles focused on the company's telehealth initiative. Earlier in his career, Bettis worked on the company's Halo product, Amazon Go's cashierless “Just Walk Out” technology, Kindle and other initiatives.

Bettis said on LinkedIn that he stayed at Amazon for so long because of the opportunity to work on emerging businesses, which provided “new and exciting opportunities, while staying under the same roof.”

More recently he had “explored a couple paths internally, but nothing sparked the same excitement I'd felt in previous roles. That's when I realized it was time for a bigger change.”

The engineer added that he'll spend most of this year deciding what full-time role comes next — maybe a smaller company, teaching, something entrepreneurial — and that he'll be staying in Seattle.

— In another Amazon departure, Steven Hatch has resigned from his role as head of engineering with AWS Bedrock. Hatch, based in New York City, has been with Amazon for nearly 18 years, working in areas including with Audible, Amazon Prime delivery experience, computer vision and most recently in AI.

Hatch said on LinkedIn that he's “closing a chapter that changed how I think, lead, and build. I'm proud of my achievements. But the real story was about the people, the learning, and the craft.”

Hatch did not disclose his next move, but said there would be “more soon.”

— Warren McNeel left T-Mobile after more then 25 years with the Bellevue-based telecom juggernaut. McNeel has been in the wireless sector for three decades, and most recently served as T-Mobile's senior vice president of information technology.

McNeel said on LinkedIn that he wanted to spend time with his family “and begin thinking about the next chapter of my professional journey.” 

“I've had the privilege of leading some of the best technology and product teams in the industry,” he added. “I couldn't be more proud of the innovations, technology transformations, and results these teams delivered.”

— Seattle-based Gates Foundation appointed Sri Mulyani  Indrawati to its governing board. Indrawati was Indonesia's first female minister of finance and the former managing director and chief operating officer of the World Bank.

“She adds fresh perspective for the board as it guides the foundation's direction over the next 20 years,” said CEO Mark Suzman.

The Gates Foundation announced two additional leadership changes:

— Reverb, a Seattle-based HR consulting and leadership development firm, is officially expanding into the Colorado market with the hiring of Renee Fischer. Fischer, who resides in Denver, is a business development and human resources consultant.

— Sabah Öney joined the board of directors of Seattle's Fred Hutch Cancer Center. Öney is the president and CEO of Dispatch Bio, a Bay Area startup that is developing a treatment for solid tumors. He is also a co-founder of the protein design company Vilya.

— Seattle software engineering startup FlintLab named Diwakar as its head of engineering. Diwakar, who was previously based in India, joins from the semiconductor company AMD. Past employers include Ericsson, RSA Security and others.

FlintLab launched in 2024 and describes itself as an “AI-powered infrastructure platform as a service” company. Co-founders Krishna Seerapu and Jinesh M.D previously held roles at Amazon and elsewhere.

For every action during Saturday's Seattle Seahawks vs. San Francisco 49ers NFL playoff game, there will hopefully be an equal and positive reaction from fans at Lumen Field. And it will all be caught on camera.

Whether or not there's another dramatic tip to send the Niners packing, more than 68,000 fans in the stands will be captured in their seats by a multicamera system from Momento.

Chicago-based Momento first partnered with the Seahawks in October 2023. The company also captures images during Seattle Mariners and Kraken games.

There are 16 cameras positioned around Lumen Field, snapped by an operator during big plays when fans get to their feet and show excitement. Fans can search the Seahawks/Momento website for their section, row and seat number and see and download a variety of photos.

For the Seahawks vs. Rams “Thursday Night Football” game on Dec. 18, fans could search a drop-down menu for several big plays such as “JSN in in!” and “O-M-G Shaheed!”

The Seattle Times reported that Seahawks fans have downloaded 48,000 images so far this season, according to Momento founder and CEO Austin Fletcher. Mariners fans downloaded 100,000 images during the team's postseason run, he added.

In a post on Facebook three years ago, Fletcher likened the technology to roller coaster ride photos, but for sports fans. The company partners with teams to drive increased fan engagement and revenue opportunities by selling photo prints and commemorative physical tickets featuring captured images.

Momento expanded its NFL partner roster in 2025 with the addition of the Atlanta Falcons, Baltimore Ravens, Cincinnati Bengals, New England Patriots, and Washington Commanders. 

Fans worried about privacy or how their likeness is being used give up some of those rights based on the NFL's and Lumen Field's terms of use agreement for ticket holders. The Times noted that Momento does honor opt-out requests for fans who don't want their images shown.

In an appearance on FOX 13 Seattle a few weeks ago, Momento COO Todd Albright said website visitors looking for images are only allowed to enter a couple of seat locations rather than being able to search endlessly for faces in the crowd.

The Seahawks and the 49ers play in an NFC divisional round playoff game Saturday in Seattle at 5 p.m. on FOX.

Coinme, a Seattle-based cryptocurrency startup that got its start more than a decade ago with a network of bitcoin ATMs, has agreed to be acquired by Polygon Labs, a New York-based blockchain payments company.

Polygon said it also plans to acquire wallet provider Sequence as part of a combined acquisition valued at more than $250 million.

Founded in 2014, Coinme lets people buy crypto with cash at kiosks and says it runs the largest crypto cash network in the U.S. through partnerships with MoneyGram and Coinstar. The company holds money‑transmitter licenses and compliance infrastructure that allow it to operate in 48 U.S. states. Last year, the company surpassed $1 billion in transaction volume and became profitable for the first time.

The acquisition effectively plugs Coinme's U.S. licenses, compliance stack, and cash‑to‑crypto distribution network into Polygon's global blockchain payments rails. It gives the Seattle startup a new home inside a larger push to make stablecoin payments a standard part of the broader financial system.

The acquisition comes less than a month after Coinme was hit with a cease-and-desist order from Washington state regulators. The Washington state Department of Financial Institutions had ordered Coinme to stop transmitting money for customers, alleging the startup improperly claimed more than $8 million in customer funds as its own income.

On Dec. 30, Coinme said it reached an agreement with regulators to pause the temporary cease-and-desist order, clearing the way for the company to resume operations in the state. The company had called the original charges an accounting dispute over a discontinued voucher product.

Coinme CEO and co-founder Neil Bergquist said the acquisition deal with Polygon was brokered before the cease-and-desist order.

The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2026. Coinme will continue operating its regulated exchange, wallet, and crypto-as-a-service platform while contributing its licensing, compliance and payments infrastructure to Polygon Labs' Open Money Stack.

“As a wholly owned subsidiary of Polygon, Coinme will remain true to who we are, with the same team and mission, now with the resources and reach to take it even further,” Bergquist said in a statement to GeekWire. “We'll keep doing what we do best: making digital assets accessible to everyone, now at an even greater scale.”

Polygon, which raised a $450 million round in 2022 from investors including Sequoia Capital and SoftBank, said it supports millions of transactions daily for large banks, enterprises, and consumer apps. 

In a LinkedIn post, Bergquist said a “shared vision and the need to build faster” led to the deal with Polygon. 

“Coinme has tackled the regulatory requirements and crypto infrastructure, but the customer application layer must catch up,” he wrote. “Combined with clear federal regulatory support for stablecoins, including the GENIUS Act, consumers want an alternative to dollars trapped in bank accounts, and they want it now.”

Coinme raised more than $40 million, including $10 million round in 2021. Investors include Pantera Capital; Digital Currency Group; Coinstar; Circle; and MoneyGram. 

“A big THANK YOU to Seattle-area Angels,” Bergquist wrote in his post. “You're the reason we have a vibrant startup ecosystem (and the reason Coinme exists).”

Slackbot, the automated assistant baked into the Salesforce-owned corporate messaging platform Slack, is entering a new era as an AI agent. And Salesforce CTO Parker Harris hopes it will be as viral as OpenAI's ChatGPT.

The cloud software giant rolled out the new version of Slackbot on Tuesday. This new AI agent version of Slackbot, which is generally available for Business+ and Enterprise+ customers, can find information, draft emails, and schedule meetings, among other things, all within the Slack platform, according to the company. It can also connect to, and interact with, other enterprise products like Microsoft Teams and Google Drive to find information if it's granted permission. This allows users to work across a handful of different common enterprise applications without leaving Slack.

Salesforce, and its enterprise software competitors, are pouring resources into the development of AI products in a bid to preserve, and even grow, their market share. The remodeled Slackbot, which was originally announced at Salesforce's annual Dreamforce conference in October, is just one piece of Salesforce's enterprise AI-heavy product plan.

Harris told TechCrunch the next-gen Slackbot is completely different than what existed before; the company kept the name because it is already well known.

Harris added that Slack doesn't generally release new features. Instead, Slack typically issues updates to the product to help drive adoption, which makes Slackbot quite different from past product updates.

“It is an agent, it is a super agent that is your employee agent,” Harris said. “It's powered by generative AI, and it is something that is highly crafted and highly curated to be an agentic experience that employees and users love.”

Salesforce tests new products, like Slackbot, with its employees for months before they release them — Harris joked they like to drink their own champagne first. Slackbot has been the most adopted internal tool they've released, he said.

“Just seeing the sheer active user count is a great sign we have hit on product-market-fit,” Harris said about internal adoption. “Adopted, not mandated, in corporations.”

This is just the beginning of Slackbot's second bloom as an AI agent, Harris said. In the future, they want Slackbot to move beyond just a text-based agent only in Slack. He said they want to add voice capabilities in the future and the ability for Slackbot to browse the internet alongside its users.

“I am very confident that investing in Slackbot is not only good for Slack, it will be incredibly good for the entire company,” Harris said.

Usage of voice AI in sales, marketing, customer support, and consumer applications has shot up in the last few years. As a result, model providers have seen increased business, along with investor interest. On the back of this demand, today, Deepgram said that it has raised $130 million in a Series C round led by AVP at a $1.3 billion valuation.

The round also saw existing investors such as Alkeon, In-Q-Tel, Madrona, Tiger, Wing, and Y Combinator put in more money. Plus, new investors like Alumni Ventures, Columbia University, Princeville Capital, Twilio, and SAP joined the round. The company has raised over $215 million in funding to date. 

The startup's raise continues the trend of sizable funding rounds in voice AI last year, including Sesame's $250 million Series B, ElevenLab's $180 million Series C, and Gradium's $70 million seed round.

Elizabeth de Saint-Aignan, a partner at AVP, told TechCrunch that when the fund was talking to enterprises about how they were using AI, voice came up frequently, and it started looking into companies working in this area.

“In 2024, when we were talking to enterprises about how they were thinking about using AI inside their business, we started to hear about them using voice AI in processes like contact centers and sales developments. When we chatted with them more, we realized a lot of voice AI tech was powered by Deepgram, and that's what led us to them [Deepgram],” de Saint-Aignan said.

She noted that voice AI could help in making customers' interactions with enterprises more pleasant while reducing costs for companies, and Deepgram could play a central part in it. 

Deepgram has a bunch of models related to text-to-speech and speech-to-text, along with platforms and APIs for conversational speech recognition and interruption handling with low latency. It noted that more than 1,300 organizations use its voice AI products and models, including meeting notetaker Granola, voice agent startup Vapi, and Twilio.

The company's CEO, Scott Stephenson, said that the company didn't need the fundraise and it was cashflow positive last year.

“In the last year, voice AI has gone mainstream, and there is more potential pull. We see that we can make larger investment sooner in order to accelerate growth. And that is why we felt it could be a good time to raise,” he said.

“We weren't out looking for a raise, though. We had multiple people coming to us. We wanted strategic investors who understand voice AI and the technical intricacies of it and have relationships with companies building using the technology.”

The company wants to use the new fundraising to expand its global footprint and better support multiple languages. It is also focusing on catering to restaurants through voice AI. To that end, it has acquired Y Combinator-backed OfOne, which built a voice AI-powered solution for quick-service restaurants. The startup claims that it has more than 93% accuracy in receiving orders. Voice AI has had its challenges in the restaurant space. Last year, Taco Bell withdrew its voice AI experiment after a person ordered 18,000 water cups.

“I am excited about this [voice AI-driven food ordering] because food ordering might be the first positive interaction more than 300 million Americans have with voice AI. There have been a lot of sour interactions with voice AI over the last 20 years, where a lot of assistants have come out, and people felt that those didn't provide a magical experience. But when you can order your food using natural conversation, people would think the technology is ready,” Stephenson said.

There seems to be investor interest in the sector, as OfOne's acquisition news comes after Presto, which serves brands like Carl's Jr., picked up $10 million in new funding.

Analysts' reports peg the voice market to grow at over 30% year-over-year and become a $14-$20 billion market by 2030. With this growth rate, model and API providers will look to be multibillion-dollar companies by becoming a core component for enterprises and startups developing voice solutions.

Brazil's competition watchdog has ordered WhatsApp to put on hold its policy that bars third-party AI companies from using its business API to offer chatbots on the app. The agency has also started an investigation against the company to determine if the policy is anti-competitive.

“According to the investigations, there is possible anti-competitive conduct of an exclusive nature that arises from the application of the New WhatsApp Terms (“WhatsApp Business Solution Terms”) imposed by Meta to regulate the access and offer, by providers of artificial intelligence tools, of its technologies to WhatsApp users,” the Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econômica (CADE) said.

CADE said it would investigate if Meta's terms are exclusionary to competitors and unduly favor Meta AI, the company's chatbot that's offered on WhatsApp.

Meta last October changed its terms of use for the WhatsApp Business API to ban third-party AI companies from offering their chatbots on the app. Companies like OpenAI, Perplexity, and Microsoft soon after noted that after the policy goes into force from January 15, their chatbots would no longer be offered on WhatsApp. Notably, Meta's policy does not stop businesses from offering their own chatbots, AI-powered or otherwise, within WhatsApp to their customers.

CADE's investigation comes after the European Union launched its own antitrust investigation into the new policy, as has Italy. If the EU finds Meta in breach of its antitrust rules, it could be fined up to 10% of its global revenue. 

Meta has told AI providers that they can continue offering their AI chatbots to users in Italy even after the new rules go into force on January 15, according to a notice to developers seen by TechCrunch. The company could make a similar decision in Brazil following CADE's order. 

Meta did not immediately respond to a request for a comment outside regular business hours.

The company has consistently maintained that AI chatbots are straining its systems that were designed for different uses of its business API. Meta has even said in the past that people who want to use different chatbots can do so outside WhatsApp.

“The purpose of the WhatsApp Business API is to help businesses provide customer support and send relevant updates. Our focus is on supporting the tens of thousands of businesses who are building these experiences on WhatsApp,” a Meta spokesperson said when the company changed the terms in October.

Artificial intelligence is moving quickly into drug discovery as pharmaceutical and biotech companies look for ways to cut years off R&D timelines and increase the chances of success amid rising costs. More than 200 startups are now competing to weave AI directly into research workflows, attracting growing interest from investors. Converge Bio is the latest company to ride that shift, securing new capital as competition in the AI-driven drug discovery space heats up.

The Boston- and Tel Aviv-based startup, which helps pharma and biotech companies develop drugs faster using generative AI trained on molecular data, has raised a $25 million oversubscribed Series A round, led by Bessemer Venture Partners. TLV Partners, Saras Capital, and Vintage Investment Partners also joined the round, along with additional backing from unidentified executives at Meta, OpenAI, and Wiz.

In practice, Converge trains generative models on DNA, RNA, and protein sequences, then plugs them into pharma and biotech's workflows to speed up drug development.

“The drug-development lifecycle has defined stages — from target identification and discovery to manufacturing, clinical trials, and beyond — and within each, there are experiments we can support,” Converge Bio CEO and co-founder Dov Gertz said in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch. “Our platform continues to expand across these stages, helping bring new drugs to market faster.”

So far, Converge has rolled out customer-facing systems. The startup has already introduced three discrete AI systems: one for antibody design, one for protein yield optimization, and one for biomarker and target discovery.

“Take our antibody design system as an example. It's not just a single model. It's made up of three integrated components. First, a generative model creates novel antibodies. Next, predictive models filter those antibodies based on their molecular properties. Finally, a docking system, which uses a physics-based model, simulates the three-dimensional interactions between the antibody and its target,” Gertz continued. The value lies in the system as a whole, not any single model, according to the CEO. “Our customers don't have to piece models together themselves. They get ready-to-use systems that plug directly into their workflows.”

The new funding comes about a year and a half after the company raised a $5.5 million seed round in 2024.  

Since then, the two-year-old startup has scaled quickly. Converge has completed over 40 programs with more than a dozen pharmaceutical and biotech customers, Gertz said. It works with customers across the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Israel and is now expanding into Asia.

The team has also grown rapidly, increasing to 34 employees from just nine in November 2024. Along the way, Converge has begun publishing public case studies. In one, the startup helped a partner boost protein yield by 4 to 4.5X in a single computational iteration. In another, the platform generated antibodies with extremely high binding affinity, reaching the single-nanomolar range, Gertz noted.

AI-driven drug discovery is experiencing a surge of interest. Last year, Eli Lilly teamed up with Nvidia to build what the companies called the pharma industry's most powerful supercomputer for drug discovery. And in October 2024, the developers behind Google DeepMind's AlphaFold project won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for creating AlphaFold, the AI system that can predict protein structures.

When asked about the momentum and how it is shaping Converge Bio's growth, Gertz said that the company is witnessing the largest financial opportunity in the history of life sciences and the industry is shifting from “trial-and-error” approaches to data-driven molecular design.

“We feel the momentum deeply, especially in our inboxes. A year and a half ago, when we founded the company, there was a lot of skepticism,” Gertz told TechCrunch. That skepticism has vanished remarkably quickly, thanks to successful case studies from companies like Converge and from academia, he added.

Large language models are gaining attention in drug discovery for their ability to analyze biological sequences and suggest new molecules, but challenges like hallucinations and accuracy remain. “In text, hallucinations are usually easy to spot,” the CEO said. “In molecules, validating a novel compound can take weeks, so the cost is much higher.” To tackle this, Converge pairs generative models with predictive ones, filtering new molecules to reduce risk and improve outcomes for its partners. “This filtration isn't perfect, but it significantly reduces risk and delivers better outcomes for our customers,” Gertz added.

TechCrunch also asked about experts like Yann LeCun, who remain skeptical about using LLMs. “I'm a huge fan of Yann LeCun, and I completely agree with him. We don't rely on text-based models for core scientific understanding. To truly understand biology, models need to be trained on DNA, RNA, proteins, and small molecules,” Gertz explained.

Text-based LLMs are used only as support tools, for example, to help customers navigate literature on generated molecules. “They're not our core technology,” Gertz said. “We're not tied to a single architecture. We use LLMs, diffusion models, traditional machine learning, and statistical methods when it makes sense.”

“Our vision is that every life-science organization will use Converge Bio as its generative AI lab. Wet labs will always exist, but they'll be paired with generative labs that create hypotheses and molecules computationally. We want to be that generative lab for the entire industry,” Gertz said.

The article has been updated to include information on the number of customers.

Asynchronous (you don't know when and where you will get Internet/local network connectivity) mesh (there is no gov infrastructure to be trusted) networking in presence of malicious (gov operated) and unreliable (destroyed by gov) nodes is probably among hardest problems known to computer science.

That said, the technical problem is hard regardless. Direction-finding equipment can locate them. Moving helps but you are broadcasting position whenever active. Military SATCOM (MUOS, AEHF) uses frequency hopping, directional antennas, burst transmissions, techniques Starlink was not architected for.The mesh idea has a bandwidth mismatch problem too. BLE tops out around 1 Mbps; Starlink pushes 100+. You would want 802.11s or a MANET protocol, but then you just have a cluster of RF emitters pointing back at the terminal anyway.

Well Scott Adams was in there, venting (in a video) that his life had basically been ruined by his support for Trump, that he'd lost most of his friends and wealth due to it, and that he felt betrayed and felt like a moron for trusting him since it wasn't even worth it. Nothing had changed and the country wasn't ""saved"".

I do not let my friends get away with them thinking they are experts on everything.Adams turned his fame of Dilbert into his fame for saying things online. I mean he even started a food company! Anyone remember the ""Dilberito""??? Seems he was always just looking for more ways to make money. And reading his books it sounded like he wanted to get rid of religions.So he was human, just like the rest of us. And he died desperate and clutching to life, leveraging whatever power he had to try to save it from who ever he could.

It's tragedy instead comedy and it doesn't matter if you see it through the lens of Karl Marx (""he doesn't challenge the power structure"") or through the lens of Tom Peters or James Collins (""search for excellence in the current system"")I mean,  there is this social contagion aspect of comedy,  you might think it is funny because it it is in a frame where it is supposed to be funny or because other people are laughing.  But the wider context is that 4-koma [1] have been dead in the US since at least the 1980s,  our culture is not at all competitive or meritocratic and as long we still have Peanuts and Family Circle we are never going to have a Bocchi the Rock.  Young people are turning to Japanese pop culture because in Japan quirky individuals can write a light novel or low-budget video game that can become a multi-billion dollar franchise and the doors are just not open for that here,  at all.Thus,  Scott Adams,  who won the lottery with his comic that rejects the idea of excellence doesn't have any moral basis to talk about corporate DEI and how it fails us all.  I think he did have some insights into the spell that Trump casts over people,  and it's a hard thing to talk about in a way that people will accept.  What people would laugh at when it was framed as fiction didn't seem funny at all when it was presented as fact.[1] 4-panel comics

I say this as someone who used to really enjoy Dilbert, but looking back with a critical eye, it's easy to see an artist who deliberately avoids bringing up topics that might actually do something to improve corporate culture.

There was always a buzz and a whisper whenever someone was frustrated: “SHE's the boss who inspired Dilbert.”Internally there was a saying that ATT stands for “Ask The Tentacles.”I haven't really read the “funnies” since I was a kid but the few Dilbert comics I ever did read NAILED her org.I will never forget being paged 1,000 times a night - not even kidding — or having my boss demand I “check sendmail” every time anything and I mean anything went down.

“When a young male (let's say 14 to 19) is a danger to himself and others, society gives the supporting family two options: 1. Watch people die. 2. Kill your own son. Those are your only options. I chose #1 and watched my stepson die. I was relieved he took no one else with him.”“If you think there is a third choice, in which your wisdom and tough love, along with government services, ‘fixes' that broken young man, you are living in a delusion. There are no other options. You have to either murder your own son or watch him die and maybe kill others.”That's surely from the calm rational mind of someone not filled with resentment and hate right?

To me, comments like ""the entire arc of Scott Adams is a cautionary tale"" rings less of vitriol and more of a kind of mourning for who the man became, and the loss of his life (and thus the loss of any chance to grow beyond who he became).That rings empathetic and sorrowful to me, which seems pretty decent in my book.

And it's the framing of the statement that is the problem.  They didn't say ""I disagreed with Scott"" or ""I didn't like Scott"";  they framed it in a way that made it seem like truth.  ""the entire arc of Scott Adams is a cautionary tale"" makes it seem like he did something wrong and there is some universal truth to be had, when it's really just this person disagreed with Scott's political views.  It's persuasion, which ironically I think Scott would have liked.

It was a bit of a crushing moment because inside my head I was thinking, ""I know and love this guy's work. Surely if I just engage him at his level without being a jackass, we can add some levity to the comments section."" My instinct was that maybe he really was just a jackass and I should label him as such in my brain and move on.But then my cat got sick last year and went from being a cuddly little guy to an absolute viscious bastard right up to the day he died. It was crushing. One day I realized it felt similar to my experience with Scott. I wondered if maybe Scott was just suffering really badly, too. I have no idea what the truth of the matter is, and I don't think that people who suffer have a free pass for their behaviour. But I think I want to hold on to this optimism.

Quite frankly, this is a worry for me. I have noticed that I've become shorter with people and less tolerant as I've got older. I've started to feel some resentment in certain situations where I felt I was being unfairly treated.I recognise these feelings and things, which I am grateful for. So I work hard to correct this, and I hope I succeed, but I seriously worry about my brain changing and becoming someone quite unpleasant. You look at people from the outside, and it is so easy to judge, but we're all just a big bag of chemicals and physics. Personality change does happen, it could happen to any of us.

I would like to point out that the quality of his satire really feel of as time went on. He came from an office life in the late 90s and had a lot of insight into it's dysfunctions. But after decades of being out of that world, he had clearly lost touch. The comics often do little to speak to the current corporate world, outside of squeezed in references.As I see it, decline in quality and the political radicalization go hand in hand. You cannot be a good satirist and be so long removed from the world you are satirizing.

I don't have an estate to get in order, so to speak. Then again, I also won't pass along a house full of a lifetime of “collections” or “mementos” with little to no monetary value. The oncoming secondary market is about to be awash in Boomer junk. Nobody wants to send their precious collections to the dump or recycling.One of my biggest mental hiccups to work through of late is the changing nature of collective memories, fame, and idols. Scott is a great example who was “big in the 90s” and 30 years later his method (print cartoons and books) is basically dead and can't be folllowed. Gen Z will be spared Scott, and probably Elvis and the Rocky Horror Picture Show, ABBA, and Garth Brooks comparatively speaking.This is a meandering way to note how fast we can be poof gone and life will move on with a pace quite breakneck.

Maybe, maybe not.  My mother died a couple years ago, and while she was too old to be a boomer, she still had plenty of accumulated possessions in her estate.  We sold as much as we could, kept the few things we wanted and had space for, and the rest went to recycling or the dump.  I'd guess 90% went to the dump.The owner of that stuff may not want to send it to the dump.  My mom would be mortified to hear some of the things she treasured held no value for anyone else, but when you're dead, you aren't making those decisions. The next generation probably isn't that sentimental about it.

However, Scott Adams as an individual was deeply problematic and I would not ever stand him up as a role model for my children or behavior in general.Of course, I wouldn't do the same for a vast number of famous people, politics aside.The ""problem"" (which is in scare quotes because it's not a discrete identifiable sole-source issue but a complex and dynamic phenomenon that permeates every aspect of our modern-day life) is that we have collectively determined that if you're good at your art, you must be a person we should listen to for topics outside of your art.To use an inflammatory but real-life example:  Donald Trump is a great showman. He knows how to incite a crowd, and he knows how to feed into this modern-day mess we've made of our world.   He is objectively a terrible manager of a country, and objectively a terrible human being.But, for some reasons that have to do with politics, and some reasons that have to do with identity, folks who like Donald Trump as a showman are unable to disassociate his showmanship from his policies.  To the point that if you were to write down the actual actions taken and attribute them to a leader of the other side (famous examples: Biden, Obama) as their policies, the same folks who are loudly cheering Donald Trump on would immediately castigate those actions if taken by someone on the ""left"".It's a problem with no easy solution, and it requires more growth from humanity than we are at this moment exhibiting we possess.  Scott Adams is a shining example of both this problem and our reaction to it, and while I mourn the passing of his art, I do not mourn his passing, and reading this comment section instead mourn our present state of wrapping ourselves in the cloth of identity politics while not engaging seriously on the fundamental underlying problems we face as a people.

The ""problem"" (which is in scare quotes because it's not a discrete identifiable sole-source issue but a complex and dynamic phenomenon that permeates every aspect of our modern-day life) is that we have collectively determined that if you're good at your art, you must be a person we should listen to for topics outside of your art.To use an inflammatory but real-life example:  Donald Trump is a great showman.

President Donald Trump did what he does on Monday evening and posted to his social media app, this time about how Microsoft isn't going to cause our bills to spike by creating massive amounts of new energy demand with its AI projects. First of all, the president claims to “never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,” which is a nice thought, although someone should tell him it looks like the thing he dreads has already happened. At any rate, what he's teasing with Microsoft is, he claims, the first of multiple energy-related projects with big tech companies. To that end, he writes:

“First up is Microsoft, who my team has been working with, and which will make major changes beginning this week to ensure that Americans don't ‘pick up the tab' for their POWER consumption, in the form of paying higher Utility bills. We are the ‘HOTTEST' Country in the World, and Number One in AI. Data Centers are key to that boom, and keeping Americans FREE and SECURE but, the big Technology Companies who build them must ‘pay their own way.' Thank you, and congratulations to Microsoft. More to come soon! President DJT”

As Gizmodo wrote last summer, electricity demand from the massive data centers that are being used to train and run AI models has driven the average American's power bill up, and the amount varies from place to place. On average, consumer energy bills had gone up about 6.5% in a year when that story emerged over the summer, but in, for instance, Maine, they had spiked by an astonishing 36.3%, and that's reportedly due to the “AI tax.” Meanwhile, utility companies like Pacific Gas & Electric have reported record profits in recent years. Funny how that works. It's truly anyone's guess how Trump and Microsoft are going to fix this issue. Trump is making overtures toward ostensible economic populism lately—seemingly in the form of deals he can tout for a short-term win, like when he got Novo Nordisk to lower the price of Ozempic. Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee followed that mysterious deal up with a letter to Novo Nordisk asking about what might have been included in the still-secret terms of that agreement—including some unsettling ambiguity about the future prices of other drugs. But who wants to hear about the puny Democrats' dumb letter when President Deals successfully slashed the price of what he has nicknamed “the fat drug”? But keeping energy bills down is tricky for Microsoft to do since, unlike Novo Nordisk, Microsoft doesn't actually set the price Trump is trying to keep down. One thing Trump could have demanded of Microsoft, then, is that Microsoft simply subsidize everyone's energy bills. That would do the trick, but last I checked Microsoft wasn't a charity. It was reported six days ago, however, that Microsoft is already working with the Midcontinent Independent System on a project aimed at modernizing the power grid with Microsoft's technology. Reuters writes that Microsoft's tech will help with “predicting and responding to weather-related power grid disruptions, transmission line planning, and accelerating certain operations.” 

This doesn't sound like a slam dunk for bringing down energy costs dramatically, but it's easy to imagine broader grid modernization at least dispersing the price spikes more evenly, or even helping to integrate unused renewable energy and ease the famous bottlenecks cause by the outdated energy grid. But is this, or something like it, what Trump is referring to? For his own sake I hope not, because it sounds like the type of confusing and convoluted plan more typically associated with flailing Democrats, not with Mr. Cheap Ozempic.

Gizmodo reached out to Microsoft and the White House for further details about this plan. We will update if we hear back.

We've got a long time to wait—basically the rest of this year—to keep wondering just how badly things went for Doctor Who last year, which means there are plenty of opportunities for people to chime in and ruminate on just why things went wrong. It's not, however, every day that a former Doctor is the one chiming in.

Recently Peter Capaldi, who played the 12th incarnation of the Time Lord, spoke to British newspaper the Mirror about why Doctor Who has faltered and gave a pretty diplomatic, but interesting, perspective on it: Doctor Who, the brand, became too important at the expense of Doctor Who as a cultural entity, and chasing the former robbed the latter of some of its charms.

“The show became very, very big. And it was never like that when I loved it. So it became a different thing. I think the responsibilities of playing the part became more,” Capaldi said. “There were more of them, there were more things that you had to do rather than just, I mean, I think in the old days, you know, if you were John Pertwee or Tom Baker or something like that, you probably, you know, you spend most of your year making it and then a bit of your year promoting it. But it wasn't this in-your-face kind of thing that suddenly was really important to the BBC, or suddenly really important to a brand that had to be maintained.”

Of course, by the time that Capaldi was playing the Doctor, the show had become very important to the BBC—after all, his casting was announced not by press release, but by a televised live stage show event. But the bigger the show became as a franchise, the more that overshadowed Doctor Who‘s staying power as a somewhat quaint but still enduring British cultural institution.

“It was just a show that some kids really loved and other kids didn't care about, but wanted to watch football or you grew out of, you know,” Capaldi continued. “It became this sort of very important thing. I think less in a cultural way and more in an economic way. I think the show is a little bit of a victim of its success. You know, the show that I loved was a tiny thing, a little small thing that survived. It just survived, but nobody knew that it was warming its way into the culture in such a deep way. And I think that's what I have an affinity with.”

It's a fair argument to make in the wake of the embarrassing dissolution of the BBC's partnership with Disney—arguably the entertainment industry face of fully armed and operational franchising models—not just for the huge influx of money the House of Mouse funnelled into two seasons of the show (and one terrible spinoff that, given how badly the relationship broke down, has actually yet to be released by Disney outside of the UK), but for how much that deal, and the desire to create a “Whoniverse” of Doctor Who media, put the show in a position where failure would lead to the disastrous outcome we saw unfold in 2025.

It's not that Doctor Who can't be allowed to have a high budget (even if being a little cheap-looking is, indeed, part of the charm), but that Doctor Who works best when it is not so fundamentally beholden to corporate masters and the whims of a kind of brand importance that doesn't necessarily focus on the show itself. As the BBC begins to pave a way back to the show having a future beyond Christmas 2026, maybe it'll stick with making it on its own instead of trying something similar to the Disney deal again.

In October 2025, a brand new crypto wallet on Polymarket bet $40,000 that OpenAI would launch an AI web browser before the end of the month. The bet turned out to be true shortly after and that account made $7,000.

As you can guess, that's a shockingly big bet with a suspiciously quick turnaround.

Insider Finder, a monitoring tool that is part of a Polymarket analytics software suite called Polysights, caught this trade in action, and posted it on the company's X account, flagging the user as a potential insider with direct knowledge of the web browser launch. But as opposed to any other market where insider trading would be reported to the authorities for punishment, the post was used as a trading signal that helped the account's followers to follow the trade and make money off of it themselves.

That's because for prediction markets like Polymarket, insider trading is deemed by some to be not just ethically allowed but pretty much the entire point. Fans of these exchanges claim that gambling is not the only use case of prediction markets, but that any insider action could be used as a signal of certain news before it actually drops. Opponents to that argument say that using non-public information to make money on bets can be unfair or potentially fraudulent, and allowing it only stands to make rich and powerful insiders richer and more powerful.

“Insider trading just accelerates the truth faster at the end of the day,” the creator of Polysights, Tre Upshaw, told Bloomberg. Upshaw is a 29-year-old former memecoin trader from Canada, and his creation has already amassed 24,000 users and entered the final stages of a $2 million funding round, per Bloomberg. Even Polymarket has given him a $25,000 grant to pursue it.

Roughly 85% of the trades that Upshaw flagged and posted on X were winning, the report says, and Upshaw himself wagers hundreds of dollars of his own money for trades that he feels confident in.

Polymarket was banned in the United States in 2022 under the Biden administration for failing to get approval from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission before letting customers buy event-based contracts—in other words: make bets around yes-or-no questions based on real life possibilities. President Trump first ended the probes into the Peter Thiel-backed company in July 2025. Shortly after, Polymarket announced it's grand return to the U.S. (though its still not fully operational yet), and that Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. was joining the company as adviser.

Insider trading is strictly banned in traditional finance. But in the wild west of under-regulated prediction markets, it's coveted. And OpenAI isn't the only company under scrutiny for having potential insiders using Polymarket to make quick cash. A potential Google insider made more than a million dollars last year betting on Google's 2025 Year in Search rankings hours before they were revealed.

The CFTC, which regulates similar prediction market platform Kalshi and has greenlit Polymarket's re-entry, does not currently have any guidance on insider trading on prediction markets. Meanwhile, Trump is notoriously pro-prediction markets. Trump Media is even launching a Polymarket-like prediction market of its own on Trump's social media platform Truth Social.

But regardless of Trump's support, prediction markets and specifically insider trading on these platforms has been receiving more scrutiny than ever before. It all started earlier this month, when a brand new Polymarket account bet $30,000 and reportedly gained $436,759 on Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro's downfall in a matter of hours.

Following that incident, New York Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres introduced a bill making it illegal for federal officials to bet on policy outcomes on prediction markets. It's not certain whether or not that bill will pass, but it does have 30 co-sponsors as of Monday, all Democrats.

Last Thursday, vervet monkeys were spotted near a park in St. Louis. Nobody knows who owns the monkeys or why they're roaming around loose. But as police and health officials in the city are trying to keep an eye out for the little guys, one wrinkle of our modern age is complicating things. People are posting AI-generated pictures and videos to social media claiming to have found the monkeys, according to the Associated Press.

“The Department of Health first became aware of the situation through reports from residents, as well as a sighting reported by a St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department Officer. Currently, the origin of these animals is unknown,” the local health department told First Alert 4.

“A Department of Health Animal Care and Control Officer was dispatched on Thursday, Jan. 8, to investigate, but was not able to locate the animals. On Friday, Jan. 9, several officers patrolled the area based on continued reports of sightings, but the monkeys have still not been found,” the department's statement continued.

St. Louis Department of Health spokesperson Willie Springer told the AP that people have been posting fake images of the monkeys online, even claiming to have captured the monkeys. And it's hard to tell what's real.

“It's been a lot in regard to AI and what's genuine and what's not,” Springer told the AP. “People are just having fun. Like I don't think anyone means harm.” The Health Department didn't immediately respond to questions from Gizmodo on Monday afternoon.

Some of the fake monkey images are pretty transparently fake, like those in the form of Instagram reels set to music from the Monkees music group. Others also show the Sora watermark, indicating they were created with OpenAI's video creation tool. But a large percentage of the public doesn't seem to know that a Sora watermark means a video is fake.

Then there are the AI videos that show the monkeys doing ridiculous things, like stealing cars:

To top it all off, there are also claims that a random goat is roaming around St. Louis, though photos posted to Facebook could be AI as well. It's hard to tell in the age of AI, when you literally can't believe your own eyes anymore.

Animal control is reportedly talking with experts at the St. Louis Zoo in an effort to find the monkeys. But even if they're found, the owners are unlikely to come forward, according to First Alert 4. It's illegal to keep monkeys in the city.

Anyone in St. Louis who spots monkeys (in real life, not online) is being asked to call Animal Care and Control at 314-657-1500.

If you've ever looked at a pair of AirPods and thought, “I really wish these were behind my ears and not in them,” then Jony Ive and Sam Altman might be here to save the day.

Reports from a supply chain leaker, Smart Pikachu, who has previously shared information on rumored unreleased Apple products, indicate that an anticipated AI gadget from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and former Apple head of design, Jony Ive, has AirPods in its crosshairs.

Hearing fresh detail on Openai ""To-go"" hardware project from last report. Now confirmed it is a special audio product to replace Airpod, internal code name is ""Sweetpea""

On manufacturing, Foxconn has been told to prepare for total 5 devices by Q4 2028. All not known but a home… https://t.co/svOCBuyapI pic.twitter.com/SFumFfRIeF

— 智慧皮卡丘 Smart Pikachu (Weibo) (@zhihuipikachu) January 12, 2026



The device, codenamed “Sweetpea,” apparently, is what the leaker is describing as a “special audio product” that resembles an earpiece. Two pill-shaped gadgets, which are housed in an egg-shaped case when not in use, can be situated behind the ear. From there, I assume they can do stuff like play audio or place calls. I say “assume” here because we don't yet know what Altman and Ive's gadget really does yet.

If there was one thing I'd bet all the AirPods in the world on, it's that Sweetpea centers on an AI voice assistant powered by ChatGPT. Using microphones and a voice assistant, these not-earbuds could make calls, play audio, or maybe even control stuff on your phone. If that sounds a lot like what you can already do with wireless earbuds as they exist right now, well… that's because it is. According to Smart Pikachu:

“[the] main processor target is 2nm smart phone style chip (exynos most favored). a custom chip also been developed to allowing the device to “replace iphone actions by commanding Siri.”

Good idea or not, Smart Pikachu says that Sweetpea could be the first AI gadget we see from Altman and Ive's collaboration, with a projected release around September. After Sweetpea, we could see even wackier hardware that may include a “home-style device,” as the leaker puts it, or—and I'm not making this up—a pen? I guess, of the products potentially in the pipeline for Altman and Ive, Sweetpea sounds the most useful, but if I'm being honest, these little earpieces are going to have to do more than just dupe AirPods' best features to make an impact.

The fact of the matter is that people like wireless earbuds—not only is the form factor familiar, proven, and cheap to make, but they also allow for stuff like active noise cancellation (ANC), which is a must-have if you live in a crowded city like me or if you ever fly on an airplane.

Clearly, there's something in Sweetpea that we're not seeing yet, though. If Smart Pikachu's leaks are legit, the device using a 2nm chip says a lot—mainly that it could be used as a standalone gadget that's not necessarily tethered to a phone. Whether anyone wants that type of hardware is another question entirely. Just like wireless earbuds, people also like their phones, and if you want to see how the whole unseating the phone with AI train is chugging along, I'd point you to the heaping wreck that is Humane and its failed Ai Pin.

Either way, it looks like we'll have more premium AI gadgets to ogle soon enough—that is, if the tandem ever manages to get its computers—ya know—computing.

Someone was going to ask him eventually, and the time has arrived: Elijah Wood has responded to Ian McKellan's cheeky tease last summer that a character named Frodo would be in Andy Serkis' new Lord of the Rings film, The Hunt for Gollum. And the answer is… he isn't saying if that's true or that he'll be playing Frodo if it is. But he's sure thrilled the movie is being made.

Reporting on a panel it hosted at Fan Expo New Orleans, ScreenRant writes that Wood was quizzed about McKellan's remarks and gave a clever, cagey answer: “I can neither confirm nor deny. Listen, a wizard is to be trusted.”

However, “Aside from any of that, I'm not really allowed to confirm,” he continued.

“I'm really excited about the film. I think it really is a creative ‘getting the band back together.' A lot of the creative heads of department are back and in that space again … it's very much that core original group getting back together to tell this story that will feel like a really fun exploration of this character that we all love so much,” Wood said. “And I'm just really excited. I'm excited for Andy to direct it. It feels so unbelievably appropriate that he directs a film about his character that he has really made his own. I'm thrilled. It'll be great. And I'm excited to see…I know their intention is to make other films in this universe. And that's exciting; it's interesting to see where that goes, but very exciting.”

That's not a yes or no answer. It's not even a maybe. But one thing we can count on is that considering how The Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum isn't out until December 2027, there are almost two years ahead of us to speculate, pontificate, and analyze actors' carefully worded interview responses.

RTX 5090 buyers' hopes dashed in a fanny-pack bait-and-switch.

A seemingly reputable Amazon third-party seller appears to have duped at least 42 unsuspecting customers into paying $999 for a GeForce RTX 5090 GPU, shipping the buyers fanny packs instead. The scheme appears to have lured desperate buyers with the promise of the best graphics card on the market at just 50% of its MSRP, an offer that was, unsurprisingly, too good to be true.

The GeForce RTX 5090 launched at a staggering $1,999, but the ongoing global NAND shortage has sent prices for this Blackwell gaming flagship soaring to unprecedented heights. Many custom models now start well above $2,500—if you can even find them in stock. So, when a GeForce RTX 5090 is selling for $999, it's not just a bargain—it's a glaring warning sign that something is terribly fishy about it. Buyers desperate for a deal may overlook these red flags, making themselves vulnerable to scams and financial loss.

To be fair to the buyers, Fitter's Niche Direct—registered in China—boasts an impeccable reputation on Amazon, with a 99% positive customer rating based on nearly 1,800 reviews. On the surface, the storefront appears completely legitimate. However, looks can be deceiving. A closer inspection reveals only five products: three generic fanny packs, one elastic stretching band, and one suspicious listing for “fitter's niche Gigabyte Aorus GeForce RTX 5090 Master 32G Graphics Card.” We linked the listing strictly for educational and awareness purposes—please do not attempt to purchase the graphics card.

One Amazon buyer said, “These guys are scam artist; they sent me a $1000 fanny pack not a graphics card that I ordered. Don't buy anything from this store.”

Another victim stated, “Ordered a Graphics card and received a fanny pack instead. Now amazon is delaying my return since I returned a fanny pack and not a 5090.”

 




The Amazon seller did not always engage in fraudulent activity. A review of user feedback reveals that negative comments and scam allegations began surfacing on December 28, 2025. For months prior, Fitter's Niche Direct maintained a spotless reputation, leaving many to wonder what could have triggered such a drastic shift. Did the seller succumb to the lure of quick profits during a high-demand frenzy for graphics cards? Or was the account compromised by a third party, turning a once-reputable storefront into a scam operation overnight?

Regardless of the underlying cause, the impact is undeniable: 42 victims have come forward so far, with the latest case reported as recently as January 12. Each new complaint underscores how quickly this scam has spread and how urgent it is for both buyers and platforms to stay vigilant.

The negative feedback is struck through and comes with Amazon's added disclaimer: “This item was fulfilled by Amazon, and we take responsibility for this fulfillment experience.” It doesn't affect the seller's reputation. It appears the seller is blatantly exploiting Amazon's FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon) program. If you're unfamiliar with FBA, it's a program where sellers ship their products directly to Amazon's warehouses. From there, Amazon handles every aspect of the transaction: storage, packing, shipping, customer service, and product returns.

Since Amazon assumes responsibility for FBA orders, affected customers have likely been reimbursed. However, it remains unclear whether Amazon is absorbing the financial blow from these fraudulent transactions or if the seller is ultimately held accountable. It's baffling and concerning that Amazon has yet to take decisive action and suspend the seller.

“The CCP's AI ambitions are being fueled by its access to American chips housed in data centers located outside of China""


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A bipartisan bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives aims to curb China's access to advanced AI chips by way of renting offshore data centers. The bill extends export controls on potent AI chips from the likes of AMD and Nvidia to cloud computing, a loophole that companies in China have allegedly used previously to access the hardware.

As reported by The Information, the Select Committee on the CCP announced the passing of the Remote Access Security Act on Monday. In a statement, the committee stated that the new bill ""modernizes the Export Control Reform Act by expanding federal authority to restrict foreign adversaries' ability to access technologies, including AI chips, remotely through cloud computing services.""

In November of last year, multiple reports emerged claiming that Chinese companies were finding ways to access Nvidia's latest Blackwell chips by exploiting a cloud computing loophole. According to an investigation by the Wall Street Journal, INF Tech, a Shanghai-based startup, had allegedly gained access to 2,300 banned Nvidia AI GPUs by renting a server in Indonesia. The 32 Nvidia GB200 servers were rented from an Indonesian telecommunications company in a deal thought to be worth $100 million. Perhaps more concerning for U.S. lawmakers, the GPUs were allegedly bought after the company had secured the Chinese outfit as a customer.

Similarly, both Alibaba and ByteDance were accused of training their respective Qwen and Doubao LLMs using Nvidia chips, accessed by renting data centers in Southeast Asia.

The fast-moving world of AI chip exports is a cat-and-mouse affair. On the one hand, Washington continues to try to block Chinese access to its most potent AI hardware while also relaxing some restrictions, like approving the sale of Nvidia H200 chips to approved customers. On the other hand, some Chinese companies continue to try to skirt export controls to obtain the best AI hardware available, both over the cloud and through physical means. Beijing's tack has shifted more towards encouraging the use of homegrown chips where possible. So, whilst H200 export approval could be a boon to Nvidia, China has dragged its feet a little and still needs to approve H200 imports before big companies like the aforementioned Alibaba and ByteDance get the green light.

While H200 exports are now approved, heftier Blackwell-based chips remain firmly off limits, as will Nvidia's new Vera Rubin architecture. It's remote access to this hardware that the Remote Access Security Act aims to curb. In a statement, Chairman and cosponsor of the legislation, John Moolenaar, said, ""The CCP's AI ambitions are being fueled by its access to American chips housed in data centers located outside of China. ""This bill brings our laws into the digital age and makes it clear that cloud compute is subject to U.S. export control law, just like physical chips. Closing these loopholes will strengthen U.S. national security and protect American innovation.”

Framework had raised prices on memory modules, but now the memory crisis is hitting the company's systems.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Framework, the DIY-focused PC manufacturer, has announced that it is raising prices on its desktop PC as a result of continuing RAM shortages rocking the consumer technology industry. ""We held off on it as long as we could, but with LPDDR5x memory prices from our suppliers continuing to increase rapidly, we've had to update the pricing on Framework Desktop systems and Mainboards,"" Framework CEO Nirav Patel wrote in an updated blog post detailing the company's response to the memory crisis. The base configuration, with a Ryzen AI Max 385, Radeon 8050S graphics, and 32GB of RAM, used to start at $1,099, but now starts at $1,139. The top configuration, with a Ryzen AI Max+ 395 processor featuring Radeon 8060S graphics and 128GB of RAM, used to start at $1,999, but now it is $2,459.Framework has been particularly transparent about its price increases — moreso than the big box OEMs. The company made its last increase specifically for RAM modules in December, and at the time suggested that more increases would likely be coming. This, however, is the first time that pricing has directly affected Framework's systems. The Framework Desktop stands in a unique place in the company's lineup, as it's the only product that it sells with soldered RAM, which is necessary for use with the AMD ""Strix Halo"" APU. That means that, unlike its laptops, Framework can't sell a version of the Desktop and let you buy your RAM elsewhere. Patel wrote in the blog update that Framework is only raising prices to cover increased costs from suppliers. And he doesn't seem to think things are getting better: ""The memory outlook as we enter 2026 continues to get worse,"" he wrote. Framework isn't the only company raising prices (though it may be one of the few with regular blog posts about it). Dell, Asus, and other PC manufacturers have price increases on the way. We've also seen announcements of hikes from single-board computer leader Raspberry Pi. RAM prices have been rising as suppliers have turned their focus to lucrative deals supplying AI datacenters, leaving fewer options for people building their own PCs and for the companies that build them for potential customers. This move is a sign that 2026 will continue to be a rocky market for companies selling PCs and for people who want to build them alike.

The field of longevity is exploding. You can't scroll an inch on your social media feed before you come across someone who claims they'll live to 150.

Nine times out of 10, these people believe they can achieve this by spending huge sums on wellness “hacks,” untested treatments, and supplements.

Only time will tell whether their high-cost, bespoke protocols will extend their lives. Meanwhile, in Brazil, many people — without access to $1,000-per-night wellness clinics or cryotherapy chambers — are routinely living to 100 and beyond. 

Despite limited access to healthcare, many of these centenarians stay healthy even up until the end of their century-long lives.

A recent Viewpoint article in the journal Genomic Press describes ongoing genomic and cellular studies on some of these people. 

This research aims to identify the biological signatures associated with surviving to advanced age. Before we dig into the research, here is some terminology:

As the authors begin their paper, “Health span is a global goal.” It is not that people want to live long lives; it is more that they want to live healthy lives for longer.

Also, individuals who make it to a healthy, advanced age must, by definition, have avoided the many diseases of aging that are some of the biggest killers, including dementia, heart disease, and cancer. 

Studying the physiology and genetics of these long-lived individuals could help us develop more effective treatments or preventative approaches. 

In the paper, the researchers call out recent research into long-lived individuals and explore some of the biological mechanisms that help keep these people younger for longer.

The first one is protein maintenance. As we age, our body's ability to maintain and refresh the thousands of proteins needed for good health slowly fails. Supercentenarians, however, can clear faulty proteins as efficiently as much younger adults. 

Another mechanism might be tied to immune protection. In general, the immune system of older adults slowly declines, increasing the risk of low-level chronic inflammation and infection. In supercentenarians, however, rather than a decline, their immune system adapts to become more resilient.

Finally, some people may simply have “good” genes: Evidence suggests that long-lived individuals may have certain genetic advantages, harbouring relatively rare gene variants that support a robust immune system, genomic stability, and mitochondrial function.

Medical News Today spoke with Daniel Ghiyam, MD, a board-certified physician at MedPod LA, who was not involved in this research.

“It seems that layered biological resilience, not just one ‘longevity gene,' is what makes people live longer,” Ghiyam told us.

“People who live very long lives seem to have strong cellular housekeeping systems, such as DNA repair, mitochondrial efficiency, and protein quality control, and they don't have chronic inflammatory overload,” he explained.

Jamie Bovay, DPT, a doctor of physical therapy and founder of Physical Therapy Solutions, who likewise was not involved in the study, put it simply thus: 

“Think of your cells like a high-end kitchen. If you never take the trash out or scrub the counters, the kitchen eventually becomes unusable, no matter how good the ingredients are. Supercentenarians seem to have ‘industrial-strength' waste management.”

While females tend to live longer than males, Brazil is home to many of the longest-lived males. According to the authors, three of the 10 longest-lived males in the world are from Brazil. This includes the oldest living man, who was born in 1912.

This, they explain, “provides a rare scientific opportunity” to study these unusual individuals.

The author's ongoing research includes biological samples from over 100 centenarians. Importantly, many of these people live in regions where medical care is extremely limited. 

This allows the researchers to understand the factors associated with longer lives beyond the reach of modern medicine.

The paper explains how one of the factors that could play a role in the extreme lifespans of certain Brazilians is their unique origin. According to the authors, Brazil has the richest genetic diversity of any country, due to waves of immigrants from all across Europe, Japan, and Africa.

“This complex tapestry of ancestries,” they write, “has resulted in a highly admixed population, with unique genomic patterns that may influence multifactorial traits such as biological resilience and longevity.”

This research, the scientists hope, will provide biological and genetic information that will help them understand how we might all age more healthily. 

While we wait for the data to roll in, what can people who live elsewhere in the world do to extend their lives? 

Experts who were not involved in the study offered some of their longevity tips.

“Putting metabolic health first, keeping muscle mass, keeping the immune system healthy, and reducing chronic inflammation are all important,” Ghiyam explained. 

“This means getting enough protein, doing strength and aerobic exercises on a regular basis, getting good sleep, and taking steps to lower your risk of heart disease. It's just as important to avoid smoking, eat less ultra-processed foods, and deal with stress,” he told us.

Building on the role of physical activity, Bovay emphasized the importance of building our “Structural Armor.”

“The paper mentions that many of these supercentenarians were still independent in daily activities. Muscle is the currency of longevity. If you want to live to 100, you need to lift heavy things now,” he advised, adding that “high bone density and muscle mass are the best predictors of surviving a health crisis.”

Milica McDowell, PT, MPT, DPT, a doctor of physical therapy, believes walking can have a powerful effect on healthspan.

“Walking needs to be a daily activity,” McDowell told us. “Those who walk more have better longevity because it reduces the risk of cardiac disease and cardiac death.” 

“One large-scale study,” she continued, “demonstrated that if people who walk 2,500 steps a day add an extra 500 steps each day, it reduces the risk of death by 7%. If they add 1,000 steps per day, it reduces their risk of death by 15%.”

Finally, David Goldman, MS, RD, a sports dietitian, research scientist, and chief science advisor at Switch4Good recommended making one small change at a time and focusing on six pillars of lifestyle medicine: 

Something about the genetics and lifestyle of people in Brazil appears to keep some of their population younger for longer. Research so far suggests that they have particularly effective cellular housekeeping mechanisms. However, many questions remain.

For those who were not born in Brazil, there are healthy science-backed habits you can adopt today that will likely help extend your life.

Making gradual changes that you can stick to can be a powerful tool for longevity. As Goldman told MNT, “follow these habits as consistently as possible, while being forgiving of slip-ups, and you'll set yourself up beautifully for a long, healthy life.”

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Hi, everyone. My name is Priscilla Brastianos. I'm a physician-scientist at Mass General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, and I'm director of the brain metastasis center at Mass General Hospital. Thank you for the opportunity to share a brief update on advances in the management of brain metastases in metastatic breast cancer. 

In the next few minutes, I'll touch on three areas: one, how our understanding of the biology of brain metastases has evolved; two, the newer systemic agents with meaningful intracranial activity; and three, how our therapeutic approach, especially around radiation, has shifted as a result. 

Let's start with the biology. Our view of brain metastases in the past decade or so has really changed dramatically. We used to think of a brain metastasis as simply a fragment of the primary tumor that just migrated north. We now know that's an oversimplification. 

In a paper we had published in Cancer Discovery a few years ago, where we sequenced matched primaries and brain metastases, we demonstrated what's called branched evolution, meaning the primary tumor and the brain metastasis shared a common ancestor but then diverged over time. The brain metastases can acquire new genomic alterations not present in the primary tumor, including potentially targetable mutations you could miss if you were to only biopsy the original primary tumor. This has now been corroborated by multiple groups. 

Brain metastases often have distinct genomic profiles and unique pathway activation patterns. Furthermore, interestingly, ER, PR, and HER2 subtype switching is not uncommon when comparing brain metastases to primary breast cancers. That's all very important because it may open the door to better targeted therapies and to designing trials specifically for this patient population. 

We're also learning more about what helps these metastases grow once they arrive in the brain. Tumor cells just don't land there and passively sit. They model the brain microenvironment to create a niche that supports growth, invasion, and resistance to therapy. That may potentially give us a second layer of potential targets, not just in the cancer cells themselves, but in the ecosystem that surrounds them. More research is needed in this area, of course.

Let's now talk more about systemic therapies that have shown intracranial activity. Against that biological backdrop that we just talked about, the major clinical advance has been the development of systemic therapies with meaningful intracranial activity, particularly in HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancer. 

Two classes of drugs really stand out: small-molecule HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or TKIs, and antibody-drug conjugates, or ADCs. In terms of HER2 small-molecule TKIs, tucatinib combined with trastuzumab and capecitabine has been practice-changing for patients with brain metastases. In the HER2CLIMB trial, adding tucatinib doubled intracranial response rates, prolonged overall survival, and lowered the risk of developing new brain lesions as the first site of progression.

Let's talk about ADCs. ADCs have emerged as some of the most active drugs in the CNS in breast cancer. Trastuzumab deruxtecan, or T-DXd, has shown impressive intracranial responses in HER2-positive and HER2-low disease across studies like the TUXEDO-1 trial, the DEBBRAH trial, and the DESTINY-Breast cohorts. We see durable control, even in patients with active, previously treated brain lesions. 

Sacituzumab govitecan for HER2-negative disease has demonstrated encouraging clinical benefit in patients with brain metastases as well. A recent phase 0 surgical study confirmed CNS penetration at therapeutic levels, and early signals of intracranial activity are encouraging and continuing to mature. These agents are all now helping us treat brain metastases systemically in ways we simply couldn't do in the past. 

Let's now talk about shifts in therapeutic approaches. Importantly, we are trying to move away from whole-brain radiation when possible. Historically, when a patient developed brain metastases, the reflex was often whole-brain radiation therapy. Although it can be effective for controlling diffuse intracranial disease, unfortunately, whole-brain radiation does come with neurocognitive toxicity, particularly memory and executive function decline.

We are trying to move away from routine whole-brain radiation when feasible in many patients. We're increasingly using techniques such as stereotactic radiosurgery, or SRS, which is precise focal radiation with less cognitive impact; systemic therapies with brain activity, as mentioned earlier; and more nuanced sequencing of local and systemic therapies to maximize intracranial control while still preserving cognition. 

This shift is driven both by better radiation techniques and by the availability of systemic agents that can control brain metastases without exposing the entire brain to radiation. 

Let's put all of this together. Why is this encouraging for patients? First, it means we're moving away from that nihilistic view of brain metastases. We now have systemic therapies that can meaningfully shrink and control disease in the brain, not just in the body. 

Second, because we know brain metastases can be molecularly distinct, it does raise the possibility that molecular profiling of brain metastasis tissue, if it has already been resected or biopsied as part of routine clinical care, may provide additional insights into tumor evolution and potential therapeutic targets. At this stage, it does remain investigational; whether acting on those alterations identified specifically in the brain will translate into improved survival outcomes, we don't yet know. This is an active area of research with ongoing clinical trials.

Third, we're starting to think more strategically about sequencing treatment and combinations, so, how to integrate these systemic agents with surgery, stereotactic radiosurgery, and, when needed, whole-brain radiation therapy to maximize intracranial control while preserving cognition and quality of life.

There is still a large amount of work to do, but compared to even 5 or 10 years ago, the landscape for breast cancer brain metastases looks so different and much more hopeful. Thank you for your attention and for everything you all do for patients living with metastatic breast cancer.

The full results of a phase 3 clinical trial showed that patients with moderate-to-severe active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who received standard treatment achieved greater reductions in disease activity and higher remission rates with 120 mg subcutaneous anifrolumab administered weekly for 52 weeks than those who received placebo.

“Weekly SC [subcutaneous] anifrolumab was well tolerated, and treatment benefits in clinically meaningful endpoints were demonstrated over placebo, consistent with those observed with monthly IV [intravenous] anifrolumab. The SC route of administration will provide an important alternative route of at-home administration and may increase treatment accessibility for patients with moderate-to-severe SLE,” the authors wrote. 

This study was led by Susan Manzi, MD, MPH, Lupus Center of Excellence, Autoimmunity Institute, Allegheny Health Network, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It was published online on December 29, 2025, in Arthritis and Rheumatology.

The study excluded patients with severe neuropsychiatric SLE or active lupus nephritis.

This study received funding from AstraZeneca, which manufactures anifrolumab. Some authors reported receiving grants, consulting fees, honoraria, research support, and travel support; holding patents and stock options; participating in leadership roles; or having other financial and nonfinancial ties with various pharmaceutical companies and organizations. Five authors declared being employees and shareholders of AstraZeneca.

Salivary free aldosterone awakening response (AldAR) differed in men with coronary heart disease and essential hypertension compared with healthy control individuals with normotension. Higher AldAR seemed to predict the future risk for coronary heart disease due to its association with risk factors such as inflammatory markers and blood lipid profiles.

""Our results suggest that dysregulation in terms of an increased AldAR may represent an early indicator for increased cardiovascular risk,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Angelina Gideon, Biological Work and Health Psychology, University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany. It was published online on January 05, 2026, in Frontiers in Endocrinology.

This study had a relatively high dropout rate attributed to logistical challenges, particularly related to changes in study sites between institutions. The sample was limited to only middle-aged men of relatively high socioeconomic status. Although renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system-modulating drugs may have influenced the AldAR, the limited sample size and the heterogeneity of medications prevented controlling for specific medication categories.

This study was supported by research grants from the Swiss National Science Foundation, German Research Foundation, German Scholars Organization, and University Hospital Bern. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common form of kidney cancer. Timely diagnostic evaluation and identification are essential for prompt and effective management and improved survival.

Current recommendations support germline evaluation when patients present with features such as bilateral or multifocal renal tumors, those with first- or second-degree relatives who have had RCC, those with related disorders associated with known predisposing conditions, and those who have exhausted standard therapeutic options.

High vascularization is common in clear cell RCC, driven by the sporadic VHL gene inactivation pathway; however, it is usually not a specific trigger for germline testing.

Large tumor size (high T-stage) is primarily a feature of advanced disease, but it alone is usually not a standard indication for germline testing; there needs to be another feature that more likely indicates hereditary RCC in conjunction with this size.

Learn more about the diagnosis and workup of RCC.

For SRMs in patients who cannot safely undergo surgery, percutaneous thermal ablation (eg, cryoablation or radiofrequency ablation) offers effective local tumor control while minimizing loss of renal parenchyma.

Systemic targeted therapy is typically utilized in patients with metastatic disease; use in patients with localized disease still being developed.

Active surveillance is an acceptable initial management option, especially for frail patients with limited life expectancy, in patients with SRMs ≤ 4 cm, and for those who require intervention but cannot tolerate surgery; however, it is usually implemented in conjunction with another treatment.

Learn more about approach and considerations for RCC.

The preferred adjuvant treatment for patients with clear cell RCC at increased risk for recurrence is an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI). Active surveillance is an option when effective adjuvant therapy is unavailable for SRMs ≤ 4 cm, but positive clinical trial data established pembrolizumab as the preferred option. mTOR inhibitors and radiation therapy are not preferred in this setting.

Learn more about RCC molecular-targeted agents.

ICIs work by blocking inhibitory pathways that normally limit T-cell activation, most commonly the PD-1 or CTLA-4 pathways. By lifting these inhibitory signals, they restore and enhance the ability of endogenous T cells to recognize and eliminate RCC tumor cells. This mechanism produces durable immune-mediated responses in a subset of patients, although the degree of benefit varies based on tumor biology and the immunogenicity of RCC.

Learn more about RCC molecular-targeted agents.

After progression on an ICI-based initial regimen, the standard second-line approach is to initiate a VEGFR-targeted TKI in patients with advanced or metastatic RCC.

RCC is notoriously chemoresistant, and cytotoxic chemotherapy agents are not a standard systemic option for second-line treatment.

Hormonal agents (progestins) may be a potential strategy in the treatment of RCC, but no agents have been approved in RCC management.

Switching to a different ICI or rechallenging with an ICI is a less common strategy with uncertain benefit as a second-line treatment in patients with advanced or metastatic RCC; this method seems to be more effective in other types of cancer.

Women who took metformin for at least 6 months before conception had lower odds of developing hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) during pregnancy; the benefit was similar for those who continued metformin in the 2 months before conception or during the first month of pregnancy.

""[The study] findings may help inform future trials on the optimal duration and timing of metformin treatment, suggesting that longer use (> 6 months) and continuation up to or into conception may be most beneficial,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Loïs M. van der Minnen, Amsterdam Reproduction and Development Research Institute, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, Netherlands. It was published online on December 30, 2025, in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

A large proportion of patients received metformin prescriptions without registered indications. This study relied on hospital-based International Classification of Diseases codes for the diagnosis of HG, which may have led to misclassification and underreporting of milder or recurrent cases managed in primary care. The inclusion of a small number of participants with prior HG who received metformin may have limited the statistical power to detect significant associations in this subgroup.

This study did not receive any funding. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

Children with dental caries and gingivitis had an increased risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in later life. Childhood oral health that remained moderate to severe or worsened over time was associated with an even higher risk of developing ASCVD in later life.

""[The study] findings suggest that both disease severity and trajectory of childhood oral disease, may represent early-life risk-factors for the development of ASCVD,"" the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Nikoline Nygaard, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark. It was published online on January 01, 2026, in the International Journal of Cardiology.

This study could not adjust the analyses for smoking and dietary habits. Oral health during adulthood was not captured. The relatively young cohort resulted in fewer ASCVD events, which may have biased results towards early‑onset disease and reduced generalisability.

In a groundbreaking study published in the in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), scientists at Pacific Northwest Research Institute (PNRI) have overturned a long-held belief in genetics: that inheriting two harmful variants in the same gene always worsens disease. Instead, the team found that, in many cases, two harmful variants can actually restore normal protein function.The research focused on a human enzyme called argininosuccinate lyase (ASL), which plays a critical role in removing toxic ammonia from the body. Variants in ASL that decrease its activity cause one of the urea cycle disorders, a set of rare and potentially life-threatening metabolic diseases.By experimentally measuring the functional impact of several thousand individual variants and variant combinations, PNRI researchers discovered that over 60% of pairs that were individually damaging could, together, bring enzyme activity back to healthy levels.

This work shows that genetic variants don't act independently in many important cases. For a defined group of genes, the default assumptions we use to predict disease risk simply don't hold.""

Michelle Tang, Ph.D., PNRI Staff Scientist and lead author of the study

This phenomenon is known as intragenic complementation. It occurs when damage caused by one variant is offset by another variant in a different part of the same protein. The mechanism was first proposed in 1964 by Francis Crick and Leslie Orgel, but until now had not been tested systematically or shown to be common or predictable at scale.The study was led by scientists in the Dudley Lab at PNRI, in collaboration with clinicians and researchers at Children's National Hospital, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, George Mason University, and the University of Washington.To make these interactions predictable, the research team developed an AI-based model that accurately forecasted whether two variants would restore protein function. The model achieved nearly 100% accuracy in predicting intragenic complementation in ASL as well as in a second human enzyme, fumarase, suggesting these rules apply broadly across the human genome.""We've shown that, in many cases, two damaging variants can work together to restore protein function,"" said Aimée Dudley, Ph.D., PNRI Senior Investigator who led the study. ""This kind of genetic interaction is not an isolated exception, but a widespread and underappreciated way that variants can interact, especially in rare disease contexts.""The researchers estimate that approximately 4% of human genes have the structural features that allow this type of interaction. For these genes, standard genetic predictions can overestimate disease risk, particularly for people who carry two different variants in the same gene.

A research team at the Medical University of Vienna has discovered a new approach to treating a particularly frequent and difficult-to-treat form of lung cancer. The study shows that a combination of two well-studied classes of drugs - ERBB inhibitors and Aurora kinase inhibitors - is significantly more effective against KRAS-mutated lung adenocarcinomas than existing therapies. The research, currently published in the journal npj Precision Oncology, opens up a new and promising path for patients for whom there are currently only limited treatment options.

KRAS mutations occur in around one third of all lung adenocarcinomas and mainly affect smokers. Although targeted drugs such as the KRAS-G12C inhibitor sotorasib are now available, treatment success is often short-lived. Many tumours develop resistance within a few months by activating alternative signalling pathways - a peculiarity that led the research team led by Iris Uras Jodl (Center for Physiology and Pharmacology, MedUni Vienna) to the newly identified therapeutic perspective.

""Although KRAS-mutated tumours use alternative signalling pathways to circumvent therapies, they remain dependent on certain molecules - ERBB receptors and Aurora kinases - in order to survive and continue to grow. It is precisely this dependency that represents a weak point that can be exploited therapeutically,"" says Iris Uras Jodl, summarizing the core of the findings. Aurora kinases control central processes of cell division, while ERBB receptors transmit growth stimuli from outside the cell. Together, these systems ensure the survival of cancer cells - even when KRAS is already blocked by therapy.

Based on this discovery, the researchers conducted extensive screening for active substances that can specifically inhibit the alternative signalling pathways. They found that the pan-ERBB inhibitor afatinib is particularly effective when combined with an Aurora kinase inhibitor. In cell and mouse models, the combination led to increased apoptosis - a regulated cell death - blocked cell division and prevented the activation of signalling pathways through which tumours otherwise develop resistance. Of particular significance is that the combination also proved effective in tumours that had already developed resistance to afatinib or sotorasib. The simultaneous blockade of ERBB and Aurora kinase signals prevented the survival of cancer cells and completely eliminated resistant cell clones.

""The combination of active substances we have discovered opens up promising new therapeutic prospects. Since afatinib is already available and Aurora kinase inhibitors are already in clinical trials, the path to application could be relatively short,"" said Iris Uras Jodl in the run-up to further, more in-depth studies.

Scientists at The Lundquist Institute for Biomedical Innovation have identified a previously unknown molecular safeguard that protects the heart during pregnancy, shedding new light on the causes of peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM), a rare and life-threatening form of pregnancy-related heart failure. 

In a study published in Nature Communications, Michelle L. Matter, PhD, and her team reveal that the gene PTRH2 plays a critical role in helping the maternal heart adapt to pregnancy-induced stress. 

This work identifies a previously unrecognized molecular safeguard in the heart. Understanding how the heart normally responds to pregnancy-induced stresses brings us closer to developing targeted treatments for women who develop PPCM."" 

Michelle L. Matter, PhD

Using advanced mouse models, the researchers showed that loss of PTRH2 leads to severe postpartum heart failure. ""During pregnancy, the heart increases in size to account for increased blood flow-but without PTRH2, the heart doesn't return to normal,"" explained Pooja Choubey, PhD, co-first author and postdoctoral fellow in The Matter Lab. ""That kind of enlargement can be extremely dangerous and, in many cases, fatal."" 

The findings point to new therapeutic possibilities and underscore the urgent need for better treatments. ""We're opening the door for innovation,"" Choubey added. ""This isn't just about the disease-it's about the mothers who are affected.""

When the cell's recycling stations, the lysosomes, start leaking, it can become dangerous. Toxic waste risks spreading and damaging the cell. Now, researchers at Umeå University have revealed the molecular sensors that detect tiny holes in lysosomal membranes so they can be quickly repaired - a process crucial for preventing inflammation, cell death, and diseases such as Alzheimer's.

Lysosomes are the cell's recycling stations, handling cellular waste and converting it into building blocks that can be reused. Lysosomal membranes are frequently exposed to stress from pathogens, proteins, and metabolic byproducts. Damage can lead to leakage of toxic contents into the cytoplasm, which in turn may cause inflammation and cell death. Until now, the mechanism by which cells detect these membrane injuries has remained unknown.In a recently published study, professor Yaowen Wu and his research group at the Department of Chemistry at Umeå University, identified the signalling pathway that is activated in response to lysosomal damage. This discovery laid the foundation for understanding how the cell senses membrane injuries.In the new study, the researchers take it a step further and have discovered two autophagy protein complexes that serve as the long-sought sensors of lysosomal damage.

They respond and quickly move to the damaged membranes when protons or calcium leak out, initiating the repair system that seals the hole. We observed that without these two key proteins, the cell fails to repair the damage, causing the lysosome to rupture.""

Yaowen Wu, lead author of the study

The team used a combination of live-cell imaging, genetic knockout models, advanced microscopy, and functional repair assays to map the sequence of events following controlled lysosomal damage.The results apply to several different types of cells and show the same underlying mechanism.""The discovery provides a new understanding and opens the door to new treatment strategies for diseases where lysosomal damage plays a central role. In future studies, we will investigate links to neurodegeneration, infections, and inflammation,"" says Yaowen Wu.Dale Corkery, staff scientist and first author, adds:""It is vital that lysosomal contents stay where they belong. If we understand why leaks sometimes go undetected, we can also understand why cells die in neurodegenerative diseases.""The study is published in the scientific journal EMBO Journal.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study shows biosynthetic method to make low-calorie sugar substitute","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260112/Study-shows-biosynthetic-method-to-make-low-calorie-sugar-substitute.aspx","Tue, 13 Jan 2026 03:02:00 GMT","

From saccharin in the 19th century to stevia and monk fruit in the 21st, researchers and the food industry have long sought a sweetener that delivers the taste of sugar without its drawbacks-excess calories, tooth decay, and heightened risk for obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes. 

Now, in a study published in Cell Reports Physical Science, Tufts researchers have developed a way to biosynthetically produce an otherwise rare sugar called tagatose, which could very well provide the sweetness and natural taste of table sugar without its potential harms. It might even provide some health benefits.

Tagatose occurs naturally in only very small amounts compared to common sugars like glucose, fructose, or sucrose. It can be found in milk and other dairy products when lactose is broken down by heat or enzymes, such as might be found in the production of yogurt, cheese, and kefir. 

Some fruits like apples, pineapples, and oranges contain trace levels of tagatose as part of their natural carbohydrate spectrum. Since tagatose is typically less than 0.2% of sugars found in natural sources, it is usually manufactured, not extracted, for consumption.

""There are established processes to produce tagatose, but they are inefficient and expensive,"" said Nik Nair, associate professor of chemical and biological engineering at Tufts. 

""We developed a way to produce tagatose by engineering the bacteria Escherichia coli to work as tiny factories, loaded with the right enzymes to process abundant amounts of glucose into tagatose. This is much more economically feasible than our previous approach, which used less abundant and expensive galactose to make tagatose.""

The bacteria are engineered to include a newly discovered enzyme from slime mold called galactose-1-phosphate-selective phosphatase (Gal1P), which can help make galactose directly from glucose. A second enzyme expressed by the bacteria called arabinose isomerase completes the conversion of galactose to tagatose. 

The yield of tagatose from glucose generated by the bacteria could reach up to 95%, significantly greater and more cheaply attained than conventional manufacturing in which yields only reach 40 to 77%.

Tagatose is 92% as sweet as sucrose-table sugar-and has about 60% fewer calories. Tagatose has been designated ""generally recognized as safe"" by the FDA, which means it can safely be used in consumer foods. To put that in perspective, that's the same designation given to salt, vinegar, and baking soda. 

Its potential benefits for diabetics derive from the fact that it is only partially absorbed in the small intestine; much of it being fermented by gut bacteria in the colon. Because of this, its impact on blood glucose and insulin is much less than that of conventional sugar. Clinical studies show very low increases in plasma glucose or insulin after ingestion of tagatose.

Unlike sucrose, which fuels cavity-causing bacteria in the mouth, tagatose appears to reduce the growth of some of those bacteria, and evidence suggests it has probiotic effects to support healthy oral and gut bacteria. 

With low calories and low absorption, tagatose is an attractive ""bulk sweetener,"" which means it not only can replace sugar for sweetness, but can also provide a similar bulk texture in cooking that comes with adding the sugar in some quantity, something that high intensity sweetener substitutes can't do. It even browns like table sugar during cooking. In taste testing compared to other sugars and sugar substitutes, it has the most similarity to table sugar.

The key innovation in the biosynthesis of tagatose was in finding the slime mold Gal1P enzyme and splicing it into our production bacteria. That allowed us to reverse a natural biological pathway that metabolizes galactose to glucose and instead generate galactose from glucose supplied as a feedstock. Tagatose and potentially other rare sugars can be synthesized from that point.""

Select gut bacteria protect mice against post-influenza virus secondary bacterial pneumonia, according to a study published by researchers in the Institute for Biomedical Sciences at Georgia State University.

The study, published in the journal Science Immunology, sought to define whether intestinal bacteria influenced some individuals' vulnerability to secondary bacterial infections following primary respiratory viral infection. It examined, in mice, whether segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), variably present in the intestine of mammals, influenced susceptibility to secondary bacterial infection by common respiratory bacterial pathogens, namely Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae or Staphylococcus aureus, following influenza A virus infection. 

The researchers found that SFB provided marked protection against these highly lethal infections. Much of the morbidity and mortality caused by influenza pandemics results from secondary bacterial infections, suggesting that an individual's gut microbiota composition may be a pivotal factor in who survives such pandemics.

SFB's protection against post-viral secondary bacterial pneumonia was mediated by specialized immune cells called alveolar macrophages. These cells are known to become dysfunctional following influenza viral infection. While SFB resides exclusively on the outer surface of the intestine, it nonetheless epigenetically reprogrammed alveolar macrophages to resist influenza virus-induced dysfunction, thus maintaining their robust defense against respiratory bacterial pathogens.

The intestine is normally colonized by thousands of different bacterial species but yet, incredibly, adding one more completely changes the way that lung macrophages respond to pathogens.""

Vu Ngo, lead author, research assistant professor in the Institute for Biomedical Sciences at Georgia State

""We're very hopeful that we'll soon be able to harness the mechanism by which SFB reprograms alveolar macrophages, yielding novel pharmacologic approaches to mitigate the severity of a broad assortment of respiratory infections,"" added senior author Andrew T. Gewirtz of the Institute for Biomedical Sciences. 

Additional authors of the study include Carolin M. Lieber, Hirohito Abo, Michal Kuczma, Jun Zou and Richard K. Plemper of the Institute for Biomedical Sciences.

The study was funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Wearable health devices, such as smartwatches, have become commonplace, enabling the continuous monitoring of physiological signals at the skin's surface. Recently, a research team in Japan has developed a biohybrid approach that works inside the body-transforming engineered skin to a visible indicator of internal biological states.

A joint research group, led by Tokyo City University and the University of Tokyo, in collaboration with RIKEN and Canon Medical Systems Co., has unveiled a living sensor display: an engineered skin graft that fluoresces in response to specific biomarkers, such as inflammation. Reported in Nature Communications, the system leverages the body's natural skin regeneration to support long-term biomarker monitoring, providing a visual readout without blood sampling after implantation and enabling intuitive assessment by observation.

The monitoring of internal biomarkers-proteins that indicate inflammation, stress, or disease-typically relies on blood sampling or externally attached sensors that operate only for limited durations. 

""Conventional approaches are often invasive or provide only snapshots in time,"" Distinguished Professor Hiroyuki Fujita of Tokyo City University (Professor Emeritus, The University of Tokyo).""Our goal was to explore a biologically integrated system that enables continuous sensing and intuitive interpretation, even at home.""

To achieve this, the researchers used epidermal stem cells, which naturally maintain and renew the skin throughout life. By genetically engineering these cells to respond to inflammatory signaling-more specifically, the activation of the NF-κB pathway-the team generated skin tissue that expresses enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in response to inflammation-related signals.

When transplanted onto mice, the engineered skin engrafted and functionally integrated with the host tissue. Upon the induction of inflammation, the grafted area emitted green fluorescence, translating internal molecular signals to an external optical signal.

Because the sensor comprises living epidermal stem cells, it is maintained through the skin's natural turnover.

Unlike conventional devices that require power sources or periodic replacement, this system is biologically maintained by the body itself. In our experiments, the sensor functionality was preserved for over 200 days, as the engineered stem cells continuously regenerated the epidermis.""

Professor Shoji Takeuchi, University of Tokyo

This study demonstrates a proof of concept for long-term, biologically integrated sensing without batteries, wiring, or active user operation. Although this work focused on inflammatory signaling, the underlying strategy is adaptable. By modifying the molecular targets, similar engineered skin constructs could be designed to respond to other physiological or metabolic cues.

The researchers note that such technology could have applications beyond human healthcare, including those in animal research and veterinary medicine, where visual indicators of health status may aid the early detection of disease in animals unable to communicate symptoms.

Although still at an early preclinical stage, this work offers a biologically grounded approach for interfacing living tissues with sensing functions, blurring the boundary between biological systems and engineered devices.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study identifies PUF60 as a critical vulnerability in triple negative breast cancer","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260112/Study-identifies-PUF60-as-a-critical-vulnerability-in-triple-negative-breast-cancer.aspx","Tue, 13 Jan 2026 02:39:00 GMT","

Researchers at University of California San Diego have identified a previously unrecognized treatment target for triple‑negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer. Their new study reveals that a protein called PUF60 plays an essential role in helping TNBC cells grow and survive by controlling how key genes are spliced. In models of TNBC, disrupting the activity of PUF60 caused widespread errors in gene processing, resulting in DNA damage, cell‑cycle arrest and ultimately tumor cell death. However, healthy cells were unaffected.

TNBC is widely recognized as the most difficult breast cancer to treat because it is very aggressive and does not respond to targeted therapies, such as immunotherapy or hormone therapy, that can be used in other subtypes. Because of this lack of targeted therapies, patients of TNBC often face poor prognosis. To address this gap in available treatments, cancer researchers are working to identify new ways to target this elusive cancer, such as by attacking the molecular machinery cancer cells use to stay alive.

Key findings from the new study include:

This study highlights PUF60‑mediated RNA splicing as a promising therapeutic angle for TNBC and potentially other cancers characterized by replication stress. By pinpointing PUF60 as a regulator that cancer cells depend on - but healthy cells do not - the findings suggest a new direction for future drug development. However, further research is needed to explore whether inhibitors targeting PUF60 or its splice‑site interactions can be developed as targeted cancer therapies.

The study, published in Cancer Research, was led by Corina Antal, PhD, assistant professor, and Gene Yeo, PhD, professor, both at UC San Diego School of Medicine. Both are also members of UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Cat disease research reveals coronavirus's broad attack on the immune system","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260113/Cat-disease-research-reveals-coronaviruss-broad-attack-on-the-immune-system.aspx","Tue, 13 Jan 2026 12:14:00 GMT","

Researchers at the University of California, Davis, have uncovered new details about how a once-deadly coronavirus disease in cats spreads through the immune system. The findings may help scientists better understand long COVID and other long-lasting inflammatory illnesses in people.

The disease, feline infectious peritonitis or FIP, is caused by a form of feline coronavirus that changes inside some cats. If left untreated, it is almost always fatal. While FIP only affects cats, it shares many features with serious coronavirus-related conditions in humans, including severe inflammation that can damage multiple organs, as well as symptoms that can persist or return.

For years, the prevailing belief was that the virus behind FIP infected just one type of immune cell. 

What we found is that it actually infects a much broader range of immune cells, including those that are critical for fighting infection.""

Amir Kol, lead author, associate professor, UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine

The study was published in the journal Veterinary Microbiology.

The researchers examined lymph node samples from cats with naturally occurring FIP. Lymph nodes are key immune system hubs where white blood cells gather and coordinate responses to disease. The team found viral material inside several types of immune cells - including B lymphocytes, which produce antibodies, and T lymphocytes, which help the immune system recognize and eliminate infected cells.

They also found evidence that the virus was actively replicating itself inside these immune cells, rather than simply leaving behind harmless fragments. 

In people with severe or long-lasting coronavirus illnesses, scientists suspect that the virus may persist in the body or continue to disrupt the immune system. Studying this directly in humans is difficult, because doctors rarely have access to immune tissues such as lymph nodes.

Cats with FIP offer a rare opportunity to study these processes up close.

""This is where cats give us a unique opportunity,"" Kol said. ""We can directly study infected immune tissues in a naturally occurring coronavirus disease - something that's very difficult to do in people.""

The researchers also found that traces of the virus could remain in immune cells even after antiviral treatment ended and cats appeared healthy. Because some immune cells can live for years, this lingering infection could help explain long-term immune problems or disease relapse.

The findings suggest that FIP may serve as a valuable real-world model for understanding how coronaviruses interact with the immune system over time. Insights gained from cats could help guide future research into chronic inflammation and post-viral syndromes in humans, including long COVID.

By bridging veterinary and human medicine, the study highlights how naturally occurring diseases in animals can help answer critical questions about human health.

Other authors of the study include Aadhavan Balakumar, Patrawin Wanakumjorn, Kazuto Kimura, Ehren McLarty, Katherine Farrell, Terza Brostoff, Jully Pires, Tamar Cohen-Davidyan, Jennifer M. Cassano, Brian Murphy and Krystle Reagan of UC Davis.

Funding for the study was provided by the National Institutes of Health and the Sock-FIP fund at the Center for Companion Animal Health at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. It was also supported by the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at Kasetsart University in Thailand.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","U.S. Women's National Team returns to UCSB for friendly match against Chile","https://www.ksby.com/santa-barbara-south-coast/u-s-womens-national-team-returns-to-ucsb-for-friendly-match-against-chile","Tue, 13 Jan 2026 01:20:24 GMT","

The U.S. Women's National Soccer Team will play Chile in a friendly game at Harder Stadium on the UC Santa Barbara campus on Jan. 27 at 7 p.m. It will mark the return to the field where the team last played more than three decades ago.

The national team's previous visit to Harder Stadium came in 1991, just weeks before the U.S. beat Norway to win the program's first World Cup. That matchup against the UCSB Gauchos was one of the squad's final tune-up games before making history.

“Having a chance to play all together and coming at us… it was intimidating,” said Linda Meyer, a Gauchos player at the time. “We were all, as we should be, a little scared.”

Aaron Heifetz, then an assistant coach for UCSB, reflected on how unusual that kind of college matchup would be today. 

“Never in a million years would the U.S. Women's National Team play a college squad in a promoted stadium match like that now,” he said.

The national team rolled to a 10–0 win that day and, aside from training camps, did not return to Santa Barbara until now. Heifetz, who is currently U.S. Soccer's Director of Communications, helped bring the team back to Harder Stadium this month.

“There's a 15,000-seat stadium here in Santa Barbara, and it's called 'soccer heaven.' Welcome to soccer heaven,” Heifetz said to his colleague, who is in charge of booking the matches for the team.

Meyer, who now works at UCSB, said she's proud her team played a part in the early days of the national program's rise. 

“Knowing those players and playing against them, it's special to have been that close to the process,” she said.

Heifetz also warned fans that campus parking can be limited and encouraged early arrival. He said roughly 1,500 tickets remain. The match will serve as the national team's season opener as it prepares for World Cup qualifiers this fall.

Tickets are available on the U.S. Soccer website.

Currently, there are nine players from California on the National Team roster. ","{'href': 'https://www.ksby.com', 'title': 'KSBY News'}","soccer"

Expansion team Denver Summit got its hometown star, announcing today that U.S. captain Lindsey Heaps is headed to the Centennial State this summer on a 3 1/2-year deal. While the initial agreement is not a High Impact Player contract, per se (that disagreement with the NWSLPA still lingers), general manager Curt Johnson did not close the door to implementing the new roster mechanism later this year.

It's a significant move for both Heaps and the league, and fitting that the 31-year-old is once again breaking from the norm: You may remember she was the first American woman to forgo college to play abroad, joining Paris Saint-Germain in 2012 at 18 years old.

Heaps then came back to the States in 2016 in part to prepare for the Olympics and 2019 World Cup. She won two NWSL Shields and championships, and the 2018 MVP award, and now returns a year before the next World Cup in Brazil.

Heaps, who moved to OL Lyonnes in 2022, has scored 38 U.S. goals and recorded 37 assists in 170 appearances. She was part of Lyon's record eighth European title in 2022.

A few more details about the move to Denver:

Full details here.

Before we move on, you have to watch Heaps' parents find out she is coming home in this sweet video from Denver. Just make sure you have a tissue box ready.

More NWSL transfers 

Heaps isn't the only Denver native returning to help launch one of the two newest NWSL teams.

Canadian defender Janine Sonis, who grew up in Highlands Ranch just outside of Denver, is also making the move after less than two seasons with Racing Louisville. A proven winner at both the club and international levels, the 31-year-old also brings an Olympic gold medal and an NWSL championship to the team.

The Summit also recently announced the signing of 22-year-old Ayo Oke from Pachuca in Mexico. The transfer fee is the highest for an American player in NWSL, according to ESPN.

There was plenty of movement in the NWSL last week. Here are some other non-Denver transfers that went down: 

Even more transfers

While the offseason is in full swing in the U.S., the Women's Super League window is also wide open until Feb. 3 in England. The potential move of USWNT midfielder Sam Coffey to Manchester City leads the way on the intrigue meter, but here are a few more moves ranked by interest (my interest, that is — this is not a scientific system):

We are also keeping a close eye on Cat Macario, who was not included in Chelsea's game day roster over the weekend.

Unattached Rodman returns to U.S. squad

It's the disclaimer no Washington Spirit fan wanted to see, but knew was coming: Trinity Rodman has returned to the U.S. women's national team picture, but without a team. The 23-year-old free agent will attend her first camp since April of last year at the end of the month. But her next club is still a mystery.

Hayes also handed debut call-ups to four players: Seattle Reign forward Maddie Dahlien, 21, and midfielder Sally Menti, 23, Portland Thorns forward Reilyn Turner, 23, and North Carolina Courage midfielder Riley Jackson, 20.

Coffey, a recent staple for the national team, was not included. But we now know that probably has something to do with her trip to Manchester this weekend.

Because the January friendlies are taking place outside of a FIFA window, Hayes has named a roster consisting entirely of NWSL players, meaning U.S. regulars such as Heaps, Lily Yohannes, Alyssa Thompson, Naomi Girma and Macario are not included.

How to watch

These games aren't until two weekends from now, but we wanted them on your radar early:

📺 USWNT vs. Paraguay
Jan. 24 at 5:30 p.m. ET on TNT and TruTV

📺 USWNT vs. Chile
Jan. 27 at 10 p.m. ET on TBS 

This camp is the last before Hayes stops experimenting and starts dialing in her roster for World Cup qualifying later this year. And in case you were wondering if the NWSL's new High Impact Player rule has any effect on who gets a start — because one of the qualifying criteria for a better NWSL contract involves USWNT minutes — Hayes' answer is “no.”

We also now have the full schedule for the 2026 SheBelieves Cup in March (all times ET). Here are the U.S. games:

🎧 Listen to the latest from the “Full Time” podcast for a full January roster breakdown.

New hire: The Kansas City Current hired former U.S. men's national team midfielder Chris Armas as its new head coach. This is Armas' first head-coaching job in women's soccer after stints with the New York Red Bulls and the Colorado Rapids in MLS and in Europe as an assistant coach with Leeds United and Manchester United.

New digs: The Chicago Stars announced plans for their very own training facility, just a few months before a key 2026 season for the NWSL original. The privately funded performance center will serve as the club's team hub starting in 2027. We've come so far from the days of SeatGeek Stadium and getting temporarily bumped by RiotFest.

New deal: Arsenal head coach Renee Slegers, 36, has signed a new contract through to 2029. The team also announced that Jodie Taylor, 39, has been appointed technical director. Megan Feringa says the move is a “show of faith and intention” for the young coach and director.

New schedule: The NWSL teased its 2026 schedule release for Thursday, which is good because I was about to bug Meg Linehan for it while she's away with baby Salem! (IYKYK)

Sarge may be on his way to MLS

One of the expectations that has emerged for the current USMNT roster pool is that players need to be challenging themselves at the highest level. Throughout his career, Josh Sargent has reached for that goal from his first professional contract with Werder Bremen to playing in the Premier League and Championship for Norwich City. At 25 he seems to have found a level that fits his talents and over the past three seasons has 13, 16, and 15 goals for the Canaries while notching seven so far in this campaign. He has also emerged as a leader for the team and worn the captain's armband in recent years.

If a report from Fabrizio Ramiro is accurate, that may be changing. According to the reporter Toronto FC is in talks to bring the player to North America for an $18 million fee.

Throughout his career with his country, Sargent's club performances have not translated in international play. In 23 appearances, including 14 starts, he has just two goals and one assist. Last year he played just 62 minutes for the red, white, and blue and it seems like he has fallen out of the conversation when it comes to the World Cup roster discussion. It will be interesting to see what this move does for his prospects of representing the country this summer or if he will need to reset with the national team once the tournament concludes.

1934 Italy World Cup Poster by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, source Public Domain

After the great success and entertaining games of the 1930 World Cup in Uruguay, the interest in hosting and participating in the World Cup tournament increased significantly. Two countries submitted bids to host the event: Sweden and Italy. Italy was selected as host and 32 teams entered the competition, a 146% increase in interest compared to 1930. It was the first World Cup for which teams had to qualify to take part. Despite their role as hosts, Italy (also known as the Azzurri for their blue uniforms) were still required to qualify, the first and only time the host nation was not granted automatic qualification.

The qualifying heats resulted in 16 teams winning the right to be a part of the second quadrennial World Cup. However, it was not without controversy.

Reigning World Cup holders Uruguay declined to participate, in protest at the refusal of several European countries to travel to South America for the previous World Cup. As a result, the 1934 World Cup is the only one in which the reigning champions did not participate. England, Scotland, Wales and North Ireland again refused to participate. Their view was that their own International Championship was a far better World Championship than the one to be staged in Italy.

Argentina, the defending runner-up from 1930, experienced internal turmoil on their team. The Argentine Football Association (AFA) had introduced professional football, but by 1934, tensions between the AFA and the professional league were high. The professional clubs refused to release their players for the national team. This caused the AFA to have no choice but to select a roster composed entirely of amateur players from smaller, regional clubs.

Of the 16 teams that qualified, 12 of the 16 places were allocated to Europe, three to the Americas, and one to Africa or Asia (including Turkey). Only 10 of the 32 entrants, and four of the 16 qualified teams (Brazil, Argentina, United States and Egypt, the first African team to qualify for a World Cup finals tournament), were from outside Europe. The last place in the finals was contested between the United States and Mexico only three days before the start of the tournament in a one-off match in Rome, which the United States won.

The final list of participating countries was:



For the first time, the tournament was broadcast live on radio in 12 of the 16 participating countries.

But politics made its presence in ugly fashion as Mussolini went out of his way to make it all about fascism in his country. While never proved, there were reports and rumors of him personally selecting referees for key matches, telling the Italian team they needed to win at all costs, and in general making the tournament about the “superiority of the fascist system.” It would not be the only time when politics inserted itself into the beautiful game.

The matches would be played in eight cities, in eight stadiums. The final would be played in Rome on Stadio Nazionale PNF that had a capacity of 47,300 (PNF was an abbreviation for Partito Nazionale Fascista).

The group stage used in the first World Cup was discarded in favor of a straight knockout format. If a match was tied after ninety minutes, then thirty minutes of extra time were played. If the score was still tied after extra time, the match was replayed the next day.

The eight seeded teams – Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria, Czechoslovakia and Hungary – were kept apart in the first round.

Some matches were marred by unacceptable violence which was mostly blamed on the referees' unwillingness to stop that kind of play. Specifically:

In Uruguay 1930 all teams had used the 2-3-5 formation. In this World Cup two different systems would be used: W-M and the Método. The W-M formation has been invented in England and was a 3-2-2-3 shape while the Método used a 2-3-2-3 formation and was developed by Italian coach Vittorio Pozzo. This formation turned out to be the most successful in the tournament.

Italy and Austria played in the first semifinal in what is described as a thrilling and intense match. The Azzurri started to cement their reputation as a strong defensive team which kept Austria's vaunted attack at bay and eventually won the match 1-0.

Czechoslovakia and Germany played the other semifinal in another riveting match which not only highlighted the tactical prowess of Czechoslovakia but also underscored the intense spirit of World Cup football. Germany won the match 3-2, securing what would be the first of many awards to come.

For the first time a third place match was played where Germany defeated Austria 3-2 (four years later, Austria would be folded into the German team due to being annexed).

The hosts, as with Uruguay, again made it all the way to the final where they met Czechoslovakia. The Czechs, once again surprising the pundits of the day, went ahead in the second half but Italy tied it with nine minutes left in the game. The game went into overtime, the first time a final had gone into extra time in a final, where Italy eventually won 2-1.

January 13 – Qatar is in discussions with FIFA about hosting the inaugural Women's Club World Cup, despite their national team having not played an official match for 12 years. 

FIFA confirmed last month that the new competition will run from 5 to 30 January 2028, right in the middle of most domestic calendars, which will cause serious disruption to domestic leagues. 

What it has not explained is why national leagues are once again expected to bend around a FIFA idea announced without a bidding process, and without meaningful consultation with stakeholders.

Qatar's interest is hardly a surprise. Since staging the men's World Cup in 2022, it has remained closely aligned with FIFA, and currently hosts the president, Gianni Infantino, who has a home in Doha. The Intercontinental Cup was held in Al-Rayyan last month, while Doha will host the men's Finalissima between Spain and Argentina in March.  

Now, the Guardian reports the Gulf State is in talks to become a somewhat controversial Women's Club World Cup host given its stance on LGBQT+ rights. 

Qatar also has a limited history in the women's game. It formed a national team in 2009, but it hasn't played in so long it remains unranked by FIFA.

Bayern Munich are “increasingly confident that Harry Kane will sign a contract extension” despite seeing the England international striker continue to generate transfer talk. The 32-year-old's current deal is set to expire in 2027, and includes release clauses that can be triggered this year, but fresh terms are being mooted as a productive working relationship is enjoyed.

Kane moved to the Allianz Arena in 2023 when severing career-long ties with Tottenham. He left north London as Spurs' all-time leading scorer and with Alan Shearer's Premier League record in his sights.

A return to familiar surroundings has been speculated on, alongside links to La Liga giants, with it claimed that Kane can be prised away from Bavaria for £57 million ($77m) across windows in 2026. No sale will be sanctioned in January, meaning that rumours will rumble on towards the summer and a World Cup finals that will see Kane captain England in their pursuit of global glory.

If an extension were to be agreed before that tournament, then the exit gossip would disappear. Kane recently told supporters when visiting a Bayern fan club and being asked if he would be open to staying on at Bayern: “100 per cent possible.”

Power brokers at the Allianz consider that to be an open door for them to walk through, with further discussions being planned. An update on Kane's situation has been delivered by Christian Falk for Sport Bild.

He has said: “It is true, Bayern Munich are increasingly confident that Harry Kane will sign a contract extension. There were no new talks during the winter break. Although I do have to say that Kane was also at the fan club and said he was feeling very confident at Bayern Munich. There are no ideas about making a change. I talked with him after the Salzburg match and asked if there was any fresh news about his contract talks. He said no and reiterated what he said at the fan club. He's very happy at Bayern Munich.

“We know that the club wants to extend the contract, but there's no hurry. Kane still has his contract clause until the end of January but he doesn't want to take it. So, Bayern want to wait until the clause runs out before the next talks. Kane would be happy to wait until even after the World Cup. No changes!”

Falk went on to say, with Kane having shunned the riches on offer elsewhere in order to link up with Bayern and break his fabled trophy curse when becoming a Bundesliga title winner in 2024-25: “Remember, I heard when Bayern Munich first made their offer, whilst he was still playing for Tottenham, there was Saudi Arabia calling, and he would have earned well over a €100m had he accepted this deal. Harry Kane flatly refused it and insisted he wanted to go to Bayern Munich to win titles.

“He's won several at FC Bayern now, and there's still hope that the striker can win the Champions League with Vincent Kompany's side. It's in the DNA of Bayern Munich, and he's now living it. Whenever you talk with Harry about silverware, he's always mentioning his desire to win more and more with the club. That's very much a Bayern thing!”

Bayern CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen said during his own visit to a fan club when being made aware of Kane's public declaration regarding his future: “If he said that, then I am happy about it. He is very important to our team with his goals, his style of play and his leadership skills.”

He added on talks regarding fresh terms: “We will certainly speak to each other at the appropriate and right time. We have great trust in the process and in Harry. I have felt especially in the last few months how comfortable he and his family feel here.”

Kane and his wife Kate are settled and happy in Munich, alongside their four children. The experienced frontman has registered 116 goals for Bayern through 122 appearances - rewriting the history books and landing two Golden Boots along the way - while also taking his historic tally of strikes for England to 78 across 112 caps.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

ZURICH (SWITZERLAND) (ITALPRESS) – Starting from January 13, 2026, the FIFA Museum in Zurich will permanently display the FIFA Club World Cup trophy, allowing visitors to admire one of the most recent and significant symbols of world football.

The arrival of the trophy follows the inaugural edition of the FIFA Club World Cup, which last summer delivered 63 matches, 195 goals and a month of excitement across the United States, from Miami to Seattle and from Los Angeles to Philadelphia. The first champions, Chelsea, lifted the trophy in New York–New Jersey, marking the beginning of a new era in top-level global football competitions.

“The trophy,” FIFA said in a statement, “will be exhibited in the museum's Foundations Gallery, offering visitors a striking centerpiece that reflects the evolution of modern football. Its placement is no coincidence: the space pays tribute to FIFA's original mission of promoting international competitions and developing football worldwide. As a symbol of the latest development in global football, the trophy not only reflects these founding principles, but also strengthens the FIFA Museum's mission to preserve and celebrate the heritage of the sport with the entire world.”

Designed by FIFA and created in collaboration with Tiffany & Co., the trophy reflects the ambition and boldness behind the new era of global football. Made of vermeil gold, it features detailed laser engravings depicting the rich history and culture of the sport, from expressive players and jubilant fans to FIFA's founding date. As a global emblem, it includes inscriptions in 13 languages and in Braille, including Ancient Greek, Arabic, German, Hindi, Japanese, Latin, Mandarin, Portuguese, Russian and others. The contemporary design and inclusive details of the trophy underline its role as the symbol of a competition created to unite clubs and fans from all over the world, FIFA concluded.

 Dan Kwaku Yeboah is a renowned sports journalist

Veteran sports journalist, Dan Kwaku Yeboah has raised concerns about the inconsistencies in prophecies delivered by Ghanaian prophets regarding the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

During the 31st Night services in December 2025, some prophets, including Nigel Gaisie, indicated that the Black Stars would excel at the tournament and reach the finals. He later clarified that he was not referring to the grand finale.Pastor Eric-Boahen Uche also claimed that Spain would emerge champions of the Mundial, while other pastors made different proclamations about the tournament.AFCON 2025: Nigeria and Algeria set for high-stakes quarterfinal clash Reacting to this, the Peace FM sports journalist expressed doubts about the authenticity of the claims, saying that the same God does not give different messages to his servants on a particular topic.According to him, God is consistent in his messaging, citing the story of Moses leading the Israelites to the Promised Land.

“The messages give us the impression that they are serving different gods. Because if it is one God, He cannot give three different messages to three people. When God sent Moses to lead His people to the Promised Land, it was a single message which was delivered until he handed over to Joshua. ""So on the same night, we believe in one God, so how could He deliver three different messages on the same subject matter? In any case, football is not a spiritual exercise, is it? ” he said in Twi during an interview with Vida Adutwumwaa shared on YouTube.Kwaku Yeboah added that if football was about spirituality, then countries like Benin should be among the giants winning trophies.“There are nations that are very strong spiritually who should be winning AFCON, like Benin. But it took a Ghanaian to qualify them for the tournament, yet people want to go there for power,” he added.Watch the video below

By The Associated PressWire Service

Wire Service

TANGIER, Morocco — Fans of two of Africa's top soccer nations have had their World Cup plans upended because of a travel ban imposed by the Trump administration.

Senegal and Ivory Coast were added in December to the list of countries with partial restrictions on entry to the United States, which is co-hosting the June 11-July 19 tournament with Canada and Mexico.

Fans cheering for the two West African teams at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco were dismayed by the restrictions, which effectively bar those who don't already have visas from traveling to the U.S. to watch the World Cup.

“I don't know why the American president would want teams from certain countries not to take part. If that's the case, they shouldn't agree to host the World Cup,” Senegal supporter Djibril Gueye told The Associated Press in Tangier, Morocco.

“It's up to the United States to provide the conditions, the means, and the resources to allow the qualified countries so everyone can go and support their team,” Gueye said.

President Donald Trump cited “screening and vetting deficiencies ” as the main reason for the suspensions. Fans from Iran and Haiti, two other countries who have qualified for the World Cup, will be barred from entering the United States as well; they were included in the first iteration of the travel ban announced by the Trump administration.

The restrictions include an exception for players, team officials and immediate relatives traveling to the World Cup, but no allowance has been made for supporters.

“We really want to participate but we don't know how,” said Fatou Diedhiou, the president of a group of female Senegal fans. “Now we just wait because the World Cup isn't here yet, maybe they'll change their minds. We don't know. We wait and see.”

Sheikh Sy supported Senegal at the last World Cup in Qatar and was determined to find a way to get to the U.S.

“We've traveled everywhere with our team because we are the national fans of Senegal,” he said. “So, since Senegal has qualified for the World Cup, we absolutely have to go.”

Senegal, which has reached the Africa Cup semifinals, plays its first World Cup game in MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on June 16 against France, four days before facing Norway in the same stadium. Its final group stage match is in Toronto on June 26 against a playoff winner between Bolivia, Suriname and Iraq.

Ivory Coast also has two games in the U.S., opening against Ecuador in Philadelphia on June 14 and finishing the group there on June 25 against Curacao after facing Germany in Toronto.

Ivory Coast coach Emerse Faé was optimistic a solution can be found for supporters. He pointed out that Ivorian fans faced a similar hurdle getting to Morocco for the Africa Cup when a visa requirement was introduced before the tournament.

“In the end, everything went very smoothly, and they were able to come as long as they had tickets to see the matches. I think things will be sorted out by the time of the World Cup,” Faé told The AP at the team hotel in Marrakech.

“It's a celebration, football is a celebration, and for me, it would be a real shame – especially since the World Cup only comes around every four years – it would be a real shame not to let our supporters come and experience this celebration,” Faé said.

Senegal and Ivory Coast face the prospect of playing only with limited support from fans who are legal U.S. residents, already have visas or have dual nationality with countries that are not affected by the travel ban.

Ivory Coast winger Yan Diomande said there was little the players could do. It's not their country, and their focus is solely on what happens on the field.

“It's OK for us, we can play without supporters,” Diomande told The AP. “The most important thing is to win every game and fight for every game.”

Team captain Franck Kessie agreed, saying it was up to politicians to find a solution.

“There's also an events committee managed by the Ivorian Football Federation, so I think together with the government, we'll put things in place to make it easier for our supporters,” Kessie said.

The travel ban isn't the only hurdle faced by Ivory Coast and Senegal fans hoping to go to the World Cup.

One fan wearing a lion mask for Senegal said he can travel to the U.S. because he also has French citizenship, but he won't as “a matter of political conviction” and because of the high cost of tickets.

“I have the impression it's all about the business world. They completely ignored the grassroots aspect,” said the fan, who gave his name simply as Pape.

Ivorian supporter Tan Detopeu, speaking in Casablanca, said she feared the team will have little support in the U.S. because few Ivorian supporters can afford the tickets.

“Even if there was no ban issue, I don't think that many people would have gone to the World Cup either because it's kind of expensive,” Detopeu said.

Football fans at AFCON in Morocco are dismayed with US president's travel ban on select African nations before the World Cup in June.

Fans of two of Africa's top football nations have had their FIFA World Cup 2026 plans upended because of a travel ban imposed by the Donald Trump-led US administration.

Senegal and the Ivory Coast were added in December to the list of countries with partial restrictions on entry to the United States, which is co-hosting the June 11-July 19 tournament with Canada and Mexico.

Fans cheering for the two West African teams at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Morocco were disappointed by the restrictions, which effectively bar those who do not already have visas from travelling to the US to watch the World Cup.

“I don't know why the American president would want teams from certain countries not to take part. If that's the case, they shouldn't agree to host the World Cup,” Senegal supporter Djibril Gueye told The Associated Press in Tangier, Morocco.

“It's up to the United States to provide the conditions, the means, and the resources to allow the qualified countries so everyone can go and support their team,” Gueye said.

President Donald Trump cited “screening and vetting deficiencies” as the main reason for the suspensions.

World Cup aspirations for supporters of two prominent African football nations have been thrown into disarray following the implementation of a US travel ban. Senegal and Ivory Coast were added in December to a list of countries facing partial entry restrictions into the United States, a co-host of the upcoming tournament alongside Canada and Mexico from June 11 to July 19.

The restrictions have caused considerable dismay among fans currently following their teams at the Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco. For those without pre-existing visas, the new rules effectively prevent travel to the US to witness the World Cup.

“I don't know why the American president would want teams from certain countries not to take part. If that's the case, they shouldn't agree to host the World Cup,” Senegal supporter Djibril Gueye told The Associated Press in Tangier, Morocco.

John Currie may no longer be the athletic director at Kansas State University, but he still took something away from KU.

The German men's soccer team announced late last week they would establish their base camp for the 2026 World Cup at Wake Forest University, where Currie is the school's athletic director.

Germany, along with three other national teams, previously visited Rock Chalk Park and the University of Kansas, as The Star's Shreyas Laddha reported.

But that was before the World Cup draw, which set Germany's three matches in Houston, Toronto and East Rutherford, New Jersey.

“Wake Forest is proud to partner with Winston-Salem to serve as the German Men's National Team's home base during the 2026 FIFA World Cup,” Currie said in a news release. “Hosting a four-time World Cup champion reflects the strength of our University soccer culture, which is truly world-class. ...

“This is another winning moment for Wake Forest and Winston-Salem, and I am deeply grateful for the collaboration that made it happen.”

Currie was Kansas State's athletic director from 2009-17.

With a new year upon us, I'm delighted to share an extraordinary announcement with our @WakeForest community.The German Men's National Team has selected The Graylyn Estate as its team base camp and Wake Forest as its official training site for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The… pic.twitter.com/BIn3z1eiu9

FIFA is not expected to announce where all 48 teams competing in the 2026 World Cup will have their base camps until the final playoff matches have been played later this year.

However, another nation that visited Lawrence also is poised to establish its camp elsewhere.

The South Korean team is likely to set up a base camp in Guadalajara, Mexico, according to The Chosun Daily. That publication noted South Korea will play its first two group stage matches in Guadalaraja, which makes that spot enticing.

Colombia and England also visited Rock Chalk Park, The Star reported. Neither has made a decision where it will have a base camp, but England reportedly had been interested in training at Sporting Kansas City's facilities.

Defending champion Argentina also reportedly has interest in that site for a base camp. And reports from England say the Netherlands could be eyeing Kansas City, but there has been no official word.

So perhaps Rock Chalk Park will get one of those big-time soccer teams.

Meanwhile, France announced Monday its camp would be in Boston, and Portugal will be in Riviera Maya in Mexico, according to reports from that country.

Around 16,800 supporters have reportedly “cancelled World Cup tickets overnight”, prompting FIFA to schedule an emergency meeting later this week. Given FIFA's strict no-cancellation policy on sold World Cup tickets, it is more likely that the figure reflects fans withdrawing from the third phase of ticket sales - either the “random draw” selection process or purchases made via member organisations.

Preparations for the showpiece tournament, which kicks off in June - now less than six months away - have been repeatedly shrouded in controversy. FIFA estimates that between 5.5 and 6.5 million supporters will travel to attend matches across the USA, Canada and Mexico, potentially making it the most-attended World Cup in history and surpassing the 3.6 million fans recorded at the 1994 tournament.

However, while some concerns for prospective attendees stem from countries included on US President Donald Trump's ‘travel ban' list, fresh issues have also been raised over safety, with growing unease surrounding the host nation amid the current political climate.

One team that has already qualified for the tournament could be expelled.

Per a report by Roya News, and relayed by Ticket News via Reddit, the cancellations stem from boycott campaigns spreading across social media, with overseas fans citing safety concerns and discomfort with the US political climate. Posts carrying the hashtag 'BoycottWorldCup' have been circulating widely, as supporters voice their dissatisfaction with the direction of the tournament.

Protesters are urging ticket holders to reconsider attending “until the Trump regime is gone,” following his orders to carry out airstrikes on Venezuela, which were followed by the kidnapping of the country's dictator. He has since made “veiled and overt threats” towards Colombia, Cuba and Denmark. The controversy has also led to more than 20 MPs calling for the USA to be removed from the World Cup.

Amid the reported cancellations, it's added that FIFA have scheduled an emergency meeting this week to address the situation, including fan safety concerns, declining ticket commitments and growing reputational risks as the tournament draws closer. While no official agenda has been released, the meeting is expected to bring together senior FIFA officials, member association representatives and tournament organisers.

Gianni Infantino has long been seen as the ultimate yes-man to Trump, and make no mistake - the hastily assembled Peace Award appears to have been created largely to flatter the US president. That helps explain why, despite growing calls for FIFA to rethink its position, a Daily Mail report has revealed there are no plans to scrap the award handed to America's political figurehead.

The report also revealed that FIFA intend to present the honour to a second recipient later in 2026, meaning the award is here to stay and will become an annual fixture, like any other in the modern game. That raises the question of whether Trump could claim it for a second year, or if a new name will be added to the roll of honour. Given the current circumstances, it would surely be absurd for him to go back-to-back.

Trump will be omnipresent at the World Cup in the U.S. much like Hitler was at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin.  So be prepared for it and if you don't like it, take in matches in Mexico or Canada.

Jurgen Klopp has responded to speculation suggesting that he could be a contender to succeed Xabi Alonso at Real Madrid. The Blancos have made another change in their dugout early in 2026. Klopp is “genuinely surprised” that the Liga giants wielded the axe at this stage, with the former Liverpool boss seeking to distance himself from a now vacant post.

Alonso was relieved of his duties at Santiago Bernabeu after just eight months at the helm. He took in 34 games as Blancos boss, winning 24 of those. His final match in charge was a Spanish Super Cup final defeat to Clasico rivals Barcelona.

The World Cup winner was said to have clashed with superstar performers in Madrid - such as Vinicius Junior and Kylian Mbappe - which ultimately made his position untenable. First-team reins have been handed to Alvaro Arbeloa on an interim basis.

Speculation is already rife regarding who Real will turn to next. Unsurprisingly, Klopp's name has been added to that pot. He walked away from management when severing ties with Premier League giants Liverpool in 2024 and is now Head of Global Soccer for Red Bull.

The 58-year-old has offered no indication that he is looking for a return to the dugout, particularly in a hot-seat that is as warm as the one on Madrid's bench. He shrugged off links to the Blancos when reacting to the news of Alonso's sudden departure.

Working as a pundit on Servus TV On shortly after that bombshell broke, Klopp said when asked if his phone had been ringing: “It actually has - though not from Madrid. But yes, there were definitely a few people who felt they had to contact me directly about it.

“First of all, I think it's another sign that something isn't quite right there at the moment. If Xabi Alonso, who over the last two years in Leverkusen has shown what an outstanding coaching talent he is - and I think at his age and with the number of jobs he's had, you can say that - is then forced to leave Madrid just six months later, it shows a few things. On the one hand, it shows that nowadays there's no time anymore. On the other, the expectations at Real Madrid are obviously enormous.

“To make a decision like that in the heat of the moment, after losing a cup final to Barcelona yesterday, says a lot. I think we'd already been hearing rumours for a while. And now - I don't know if that's where your question was going - but this has absolutely nothing to do with me, and it didn't trigger anything for me either, which would probably have been the follow-up question.

“I was surprised, that's true - genuinely surprised. Then a few people messaged me, and I replied with various emojis.”

Klopp told the Diary of CEO podcast back in October 2025 when pressed on his plans for the future and whether they include a return to coaching: “I said I will never coach a team in England again, that means if it's Liverpool, theoretically it's possible. I don't know exactly, I love what I do right now. I don't miss coaching, I do coach now but just different.

“I don't miss standing in the rain, two-and-a-half [to] three hours, I don't miss going to press conferences three times a week, having 12 interviews a week, I don't miss that, I don't. I don't miss being in the dressing room, I coached something like 1,080 games so I was in a dressing room often. I don't want to die in a dressing room because it's not nice, it smells.

“There might be something, I'm 58, I could make the decision in a few years... I don't know. Do I have to make the decision today that I will not coach again? Thank god I don't have to, I can just see what the future brings. Now I'm in a project I really love, I like doing what I'm doing right now. In my mind, only if I'm focused 100 per cent, I can do it really good.""

Klopp has been linked with various jobs since leaving Liverpool, but has always been quick to shoot those rumours down.

Will Manchester United's misery ever end? It's only been 13 years since Sir Alex Ferguson brought the curtain down on his glorious 26-year reign, but it feels so much longer because of the ridiculously long list of false starts and poor decisions the club have made, with Ruben Amorim the latest manager to fail on the brief of bringing back the good times. 

The Portuguese tactician only lasted 14 months in the job, during which time United fell to their worst-ever Premier League finish and lost a European final to Tottenham. His insistence on a rigid 3-4-3 formation ultimately proved to be his undoing, but the board knew Amorim was a system manager when they hired him from Sporting CP, just as they knew Jose Mourinho and Louis van Gaal were pragmatic coaches who also didn't fit the much-debated 'United DNA'.

Amorim eventually signed his own death warrant by speaking out on a lack of backing from the club's board, and whoever is chosen as his permanent successor in the summer will have to be far more willing to bow to the judgement of CEO Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox, who clearly now share the real power when it comes to footballing operations, under the watchful eye of the divisive INEOS ownership regime. It's hard to see the team returning to the Champions League with such a problematic backroom structure, let alone fulfilling Berrada's ambition to win the Premier League title by 2028.

For now, United just need someone to steady the ship through to the end of what has been another campaign of abject disappointment. According to reports, it was a toss-up between two club legends for that caretaker role: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick. If the cloud of gloom over Old Trafford is to be lifted, even just temporarily, the job should be given to the latter, as it now seems to be. 

Darren Fletcher, another star performer from the Ferguson age, stepped up from his role as Under-18s coach to lead the first team on an interim basis after Amorim's departure. But any notion he may have held about staying at the helm until the summer has been quickly extinguished.

United were held to a 2-2 draw at relegation-threatened Burnley in Fletcher's first game, which saw them drop to seventh in the Premier League table. Although the Scot was left lamenting his side's lack of cutting edge after peppering the Burnley goal with 30 shots, he described it as an ""amazing experience"" and confirmed he would be back in the dugout for the Red Devils' next match: an FA Cup third-round tie against Brighton.

Alas, there were no positives whatsoever to take from that contest. Brighton ran out deserved 2-1 winners at Old Trafford, with ex-United youngster Danny Welbeck coming back to haunt his former club once again, and boos rained down from the home stands after the final whistle.

The result marked a new low for United, who were stunned by fourth-tier Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup back in August, as they suffered exits at the first time of asking from both domestic competitions for the first time since 1981-82. It also means that they will now play just 40 games this term, their fewest since 1914-15. It was all too much for Fletcher, whose voice cracked as he admitted to the media: ""That is where we are at - we can't hide from that. It is not Manchester United level or what is expected."" 

Fletcher has also resigned himself to the fact that he won't be at the wheel for much longer. ""Someone is going to come in and lead them, they need to make sure they have a lot to play for this season,"" he added to TNT Sports. ""The biggest thing for me is that the group of players, whoever leads them, comes together. It's over to them, they need to make sure that they have got a lot to play for this season. This team is still good enough to achieve success this season, but they have to dig deep.""

Indeed, technically, United are still in a strong position to secure a top-five berth in the Premier League, which is again likely to be enough to qualify for the Champions League based on UEFA's coefficients rankings. The Red Devils are only two points behind fifth-placed Brentford and three adrift of Liverpool in fourth, and Fletcher urged the players not to ""waste the season"" with salvation still in sight.

But realistically, they won't be consistent enough to get over the line. United have only won two of their last nine fixtures, with valuable league points having been dropped against struggling Leeds United, Wolves, West Ham and Nottingham Forest. There will be no dramatic improvement with this amazingly limited squad. Aside from club captain Bruno Fernandes, no one can maintain the required level of performance every week. 

The caretaker's main objective, then, should simply be to give fans something to cheer about again. In very similar circumstances, some seven years ago, Solskjaer managed to do that. Now, it's Carrick's turn.

According to The Guardian, both Solskjaer and Carrick held face-to-face talks with Berrada and Wilcox over the weekend, and United are planning to finalise the caretaker appointment in plenty of time before next weekend's vital derby clash against Manchester City. Ex-Red Devils boss Solskjaer was initially seen as the frontrunner for the job, but Carrick is said to have 'edged' ahead after a particularly impressive interview.

It has also been reported that Fletcher could form part of Carrick's backroom staff, along with another supporting coach, mirroring the set-up that was in place between 2018 and 2021. Carrick served as Solskjaer's No.2 during that period with Kieran McKenna, now in charge at Ipswich Town, and Mike Phelan completing the team.

When Solskjaer was dismissed in November 2021, Carrick temporarily took the reins, and delivered an immediate upturn. United beat Villarreal 2-0 away from home in the Champions League, before battling to a 1-1 draw at Chelsea and beating Arsenal 3-2 at Old Trafford. The performance against the Gunners was particularly encouraging, but by that time, Ralf Rangnick had already been chosen to come in as interim manager, and Carrick announced he was leaving the club after the game.

Tellingly, the players were sad to see him go, as Harry Maguire revealed to reporters: ""He's a really likable man, all the lads respect him and he's been amazing with each and every one of us. We're going to miss him.""

The key word in there was ""respect"". Carrick would command it again the second he walks back through the door, with the likes of Maguire, Fernandes, Luke Shaw, Diogo Dalot and Amad Diallo among the surviving members of the squad he left behind.

Almost a year on from his exit, Carrick landed his first permanent head coaching role at Middlesbrough. He inherited a squad languishing in 21st place in the Championship table, just one point above the drop zone, but managed to turn their fortunes around overnight.

Remarkably, Boro won 16 of their first 23 matches under Carrick, who picked up two EFL Manager of the Month awards along the way. They ended the 2022-23 campaign in fourth, sealing a spot in the play-offs, only to suffer a 1-0 aggregate loss to Coventry City across two agonisingly close semi-final legs. Still, Carrick received widespread praise, from both the media and within the dressing room.

“He's the manager I've been dreaming of my whole career,” Chuba Akpom, who clinched the Championship Golden Boot with 28 goals for Boro that season, said. “I want to fight for the manager because he's shown so much trust and confidence in me. He gave me the freedom to express myself and I appreciate that so much.”

Jonny Howson, Boro's skipper at the time, added to The Athletic: “It's entertaining. We attack, create, score and control possession. That's the way Michael played the game.”

Carrick continued to bring fans entertainment in his second season, masterminding a thrilling run to the Carabao Cup semi-finals, and though Boro ultimately finished eighth in the Championship, the Englishman was still awarded a new three-year contract. 

Unfortunately, though, there was no progress to speak of in the 2024-25 campaign. Boro slumped to 10th in the table, and club chiefs subsequently pulled the plug on the Carrick project. But things might have been different had it not been for very fine margins. Boro were fifth heading into their final six games, and really should have made the play-offs again. Alas, they only picked up another four points, leaving Carrick in an untenable position. 

Still he left the Riverside with a very respectable win percentage of 46.3, the best record in the club's history for managers in the second tier. Carrick was also Boro's longest-serving boss since their relegation from the Premier League in 2017, and proved his coaching chops in a cutthroat division notorious for weeding out the pretenders.

Solskjaer has more managerial experience than Carrick, but some 15 years into his career on the touchline, the jury is still very much out on his coaching credentials. The United icon, who was immortalised after scoring the winning goal in the 1999 Champions League final, delivered three trophies across two spells at Molde in Norway, with a disastrous nine-month spell at Cardiff City wedged in between.

After experiencing relegation from the Premier League in Wales, it was a huge surprise when United came calling for Solskjaer in December 2018, though the overwhelming majority of the fanbase was in favour of his return. The club had been stripped of its identity on Mourinho's watch, and Solskjaer was seen as the ideal interim appointment to restore the values previously upheld by Ferguson.

He did exactly that, overseeing 14 wins out of 17 to earn a permanent contract. In his first two full seasons, Solskjaer led United to third and second-placed finishes, and helped them break the record for the longest Premier League unbeaten run away from home (28 games). No other manager since Ferguson had been able to keep the Red Devils in the top four for such a sustained period. As such, there has been a lot of revisionism about Solskjaer's tenure over the last two years, as the club has been plunged into deep crisis. 

There are even some who believe Solskjaer would still be in charge now, had he not been thrown off track by the homecoming of Cristiano Ronaldo, but that's not the reality. United declined much quicker because of the need to accommodate a 37-year-old Ronaldo, but Solskjaer would have been found out even if the five-time Ballon d'Or winner had never been re-signed.

Solskjaer kept supporters on side by embracing Ferguson's counter-attacking style, but had no Plan B. That's why the best sides overpowered United, with a 5-0 home defeat to Liverpool marking Solskjaer's worst moment, and why they were often frustrated against low blocks, including in their 2021 Europa League final loss against Villarreal.

Let's not forget either, the United faithful booed Solskjaer after his final game, an unforgivable 4-1 drubbing at Watford. The beloved 'baby-faced assassin' had his chance, and blew it. Turning to Solskjaer again now would just show that INEOS have not learned from the mistakes of the previous regime.

Carrick is not remembered quite as fondly as Solskjaer for his days as a United player, but only because his old team-mate was a striker who scored so many important goals. In terms of overall importance to the team, Carrick arguably eclipsed Solskjaer; he was a masterful playmaker with a passing range few have matched in the Premier League era. 

He's a bona fide legend in his own right, and has made an admirable start to his coaching career. He deserves the same opportunity Solskjaer was given, and the Norwegian shouldn't be standing in his way, especially not if he wants to be true to his word.

""Michael is a man of value and principles, a big family man, but his knowledge is also second to none,"" Solskjaer said in an interview with The Athletic in 2023. ""At United, I'd sometimes see Michael talk to the players. Some of these were ex-team-mates of his which isn't easy, but he had an authority about him. I am 100% sure that Michael will be the manager of Manchester United if he wants to be.""

There is also much less risk with Carrick. If Solskjaer were to come back and fail again, INEOS chairman Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the Glazer family would come under potentially crippling scrutiny. He's only held one position since departing United, at Turkish outfit Besiktas, where he spent eight months before being sacked on the back of a Conference League play-off exit at the hands of Swiss club Lausanne, ironically also owned by INEOS.

Additionally, the i Paper is reporting that Solskjaer believes he could earn another shot at the full-time United post, which is folly. Carrick understands the vacancy for what it is: a short-term assignment. The club wants a big-name in the summer, amid links with England manager Thomas Tuchel, and any temptation to abandon that plan should be resisted.

This is about stabilising the team, not transforming it. Carrick is a safer pair of hands who can build a platform for a brighter future.

Former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp would reportedly ""seriously consider"" replacing Xabi Alonso at Real Madrid if they come calling. Alonso has left the Bernabeu after just eight months in charge, with Alvaro Arbeloa taking charge of the team. Klopp is currently working as the Head of Global Soccer at Red Bull, but it has been claimed he could be tempted back into football management by Real Madrid.

Defeat to Barcelona in Sunday's Supercopa de Espana final proved to be the end for Alonso at Real Madrid. The club confirmed in the wake of the 3-2 loss that the former midfielder had left the club and would be replaced by Arbeloa. The announcement ends a tough few months for the ex-Spain international at the Bernabeu. His team have let slip a five-point lead at the top of the table to Barcelona and now sit four points behind their bitter rivals in the race to be crowned La Liga champions. Alonso's tenure has also been plagued by reports of problems in the dressing room with several of his biggest stars including Vinicius Jr, Federico Valverde, Jude Bellingham and Kylian Mbappe. 

While Arbeloa has taken charge of Madrid for the time being, Klopp would consider taking over in the summer if an approach was made, according to Sky Sports. The prospect of coaching Real Madrid is said to ""hold a major appeal"" for Klopp and could be enough to tempt him back into football management. Klopp had previously suggested he wouldn't return to management, telling The Athletic back in September that he doesn't miss anything about his former job. The ex-Liverpool boss has also admitted previously that being a manager took him ""far away from normal life"" and that he's been enjoying ""a job now that fulfils me"" with Red Bull.

Klopp has already been quizzed on the situation at Real Madrid following Alonso's departure. He told Servus TV that his phone has already been ringing. He said: ""It actually has - though not from Madrid. But yes, there were definitely a few people who felt they had to contact me directly about it. First of all, I think it's another sign that something isn't quite right there at the moment. If Xabi Alonso, who over the last two years in Leverkusen has shown what an outstanding coaching talent he is - and I think at his age and with the number of jobs he's had, you can say that - is then forced to leave Madrid just six months later, it shows a few things. On the one hand, it shows that nowadays there's no time anymore. On the other, the expectations at Real Madrid are obviously enormous.

""To make a decision like that in the heat of the moment, after losing a cup final to Barcelona yesterday, says a lot. I think we'd already been hearing rumours for a while. And now - I don't know if that's where your question was going - but this has absolutely nothing to do with me, and it didn't trigger anything for me either, which would probably have been the follow-up question. I was surprised, that's true - genuinely surprised. Then a few people messaged me, and I replied with various emojis.""

Arbeloa, who has taken the job after several years in charge of the reserve team, has already been asked about his future and whether he expects to be at Real Madrid for the long term. He told a press conference: ""I've been at this club for 20 years, and I'll be here as long as Real Madrid want me to be. This is my home, and it always will be.""

Results and performances will obviously dictate just how Arbeloa lasts, with Real Madrid set to return to action after their Supercopa de Espana disappointment against Albacete in the last 16 of the Copa del Rey on Wednesday.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Xabi Alonso has broken his silence following his abrupt departure from Real Madrid, issuing a dignified statement that addresses his time in the dugout. The Basque tactician was relieved of his duties just a day after a painful Super Cup defeat to Barcelona, but he refused to show bitterness, instead sending a clear message of gratitude to his squad and the Bernabeu faithful.

Alonso has officially addressed his exit from Real Madrid, taking to social media to share a heartfelt message just hours after his tenure at the Santiago Bernabeu was brought to a premature end. The 44-year-old's time in charge of Los Blancos was terminated following Sunday's 3-2 defeat to arch-rivals Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup final, a result that ultimately convinced the club's hierarchy to make a change.

Despite the stinging disappointment of losing his job in the wake of an El Clasico defeat, Alonso displayed the class that defined his playing career. The former midfielder refused to point fingers at the board or offer excuses for the team's performance. Instead, he expressed his pride at having led the club where he won the Champions League as a player, whilst acknowledging the harsh reality that results had fallen short of the lofty standards expected in the Spanish capital.

One of the most scrutinised aspects of any managerial departure at Real Madrid is the relationship between the head coach and the star-studded dressing room. Rumours of unrest swirled around the capital club, particularly due to his relationship with Vinicius Junior. The Brazilian winger was occasionally dropped to the bench and his angry reaction at being substituted in the previous game against Barcelona - a Madrid win in La Liga - sparked claims of an imminent separation. On Sunday evening, star forward Kylian Mbappe appeared to stop his team-mates from giving Barcelona a guard of honour before they collected their Super Cup prize, despite Alonso's apparent orders to go through with the traditional pleasantries, which is said to have been the final straw regarding his tenure.

Nevertheless, he praised the team in his farewell message on Instagram a day after his exit.

""This professional stage concludes, and it has not turned out as we would have liked. Coaching Real Madrid has been an honour and a responsibility,"" Alonso wrote. ""I thank the club, the players and above all the fans and Madrid fans for their trust and support. I leave with respect, gratitude, and pride that I did my best.""

After his historic work at Bayer Leverkusen, where he went unbeaten to win the Bundesliga title, Alonso was identified as the ideal candidate to lead Real Madrid into a new era. However, translating that specific brand of dominance to the Bernabeu proved difficult against the backdrop of immense pressure.

Despite claims that Mbappe has played a key role in his departure, the French forward took to social media to give his verdict shortly after Madrid announced his departure, saying: ""It's been short but it was a pleasure to play for you and learn from you. Thank you for giving me the confidence since Day 1. I will remember you as a manager who had clear ideas and knows many things about football. Best of luck for your next chapter.""

Madrid have already appointed Alvaro Arbeloa as the new first-team head coach. The ex-Liverpool defender has been serving as the boss of their B team and will now step up into the Bernabeu hotseat for the time being. The 42-year-old won two Champions League trophies as a player with Madrid as well as a La Liga crown and the Copa del Rey on two occasions. 

The capital club will be in action again on Thursday when they take on Albacete in the Copa del Rey, followed three days later by a La Liga clash against Levante.

UFC legend Khabib Nurmagomedov has unleashed a furious tirade against Real Madrid's stars following the shock dismissal of Xabi Alonso. The undefeated fighter did not hold back in his assessment of the situation at the Bernabeu, branding the squad ""spoiled brats"" and insisting that the club should have cleared out the dressing room rather than sacking one of the world's best tactical minds.

The footballing world is still reeling from the sudden exit of Alonso. The 44-year-old saw his dream job cut short following a disappointing defeat in the Spanish Super Cup final against Barcelona, a result that prompted club president Florentino Perez to pull the trigger halfway through the season. While pundits and fans debate the fairness of the decision, one of the most dominant athletes in combat sports history has firmly nailed his colours to the mast.

Khabib, the former UFC lightweight champion and a well-documented Real Madrid supporter, took to Instagram to vent his frustration at the news. Known for his discipline, respect, and loyalty in the octagon, the Russian fighter was incensed by what he perceives as a betrayal of a top-class coach by a group of underperforming players. In a series of stories posted to his millions of followers, 'The Eagle' launched a scathing attack on the culture within the Madrid dressing room, suggesting that player power has spiralled out of control at the expense of managerial stability.

Nurmagomedov's primary grievance lies with the attitude of the Real Madrid players, whom he explicitly blamed for Alonso's failure to succeed. The fighter, who retired with a perfect 29-0 record, knows a thing or two about the dedication required to stay at the top, and he clearly feels that the current crop of Galacticos lacks the humility to follow instructions.

""Whether in the gym or on the pitch, it doesn't matter if it's boxers or footballers, you are responsible as a coach,"" Khabib wrote. ""But if your team gives off such an aura that some players don't respond to your demands, then you are clearly on the wrong path.

""I think Alonso is one of the top three coaches right now. If this team isn't working well with him, you need to change the players, not the coach. I'm simply certain that no coach can manage a squad like Real Madrid's. You have to get rid of the unpredictable players. There's nothing like loyalty.""

Despite the difficult spell in Madrid, Khabib remains convinced of Alonso's pedigree. The manager arrived in the Spanish capital with a reputation as the brightest young mind in football a year on from his miraculous unbeaten Bundesliga title run with Bayer Leverkusen. For Khabib, that quality does not disappear overnight, and he argued that Alonso remains in the elite bracket of global coaches, turning the blame entirely on the players.

Another Instagram Story post read: ""A year ago, they were begging him. Now they've fired him. Because of these spoiled brats. Xabi, you're the best.""

His fury at the Madrid stars comes amid a wave of criticism aimed at the likes of Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior following Alonso's exit. Tensions between the coach and the Brazilian winger had been building all season, with Alonso dropping Vinicius to the bench on occasion. Furthermore, Mbappe's decision to discourage his team-mates from giving Barca a guard of honour despite Alonso's instructions after the Super Cup were seen as the final straw for the manager.

The emotional core of Khabib's message focused on the fickle nature of the sport. He highlighted the stark contrast between the desperate courtship of Alonso a year ago and the ruthless manner in which he was discarded this week. The Russian icon, who places a high value on loyalty within his own team, expressed disgust at how quickly the narrative shifted.

Alonso was once the most coveted manager in world football following his exploits in Germany. Real Madrid won the race to land him, viewing him as the chosen one to define an era. To abandon that project after a single Super Cup defeat speaks to the unique, pressure-cooker environment at the Bernabeu, where patience is non-existent and memory is short.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Man Utd urged to make 'huge move' into $50 BILLION NBA Europe project as more Premier League clubs are tipped to follow Real Madrid & Barcelona with own basketball teams","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/man-utd-huge-move-50-billion-nba-europe-project-premier-league-clubs-follow-real-madrid-barcelona-basketball-teams/blt321c6342d684efbb","Tue, 13 Jan 2026 13:52:49 GMT","

Manchester United are being urged to explore potential routes into the exciting new NBA Europe project that could be worth around $50 billion (£37bn). A potentially lucrative venture is being pitched by the National Basketball Association, with the plan being to create 12 franchises - and four teams that qualify without owning equity - which would be valued at up to $1 billion (£743m) each. Premier League giants United have been advised to join discussions regarding a crossover enterprise.

The likes of Barcelona, Real Madrid and Olympiacos already boast basketball teams in their respective sporting stables, with English superpowers being told to join the party. The NBA is ready to provide investors with financial projections and other key information, with meetings that bring potential sponsors, media partners and investors to the table expected to take place before the end of January.

Speaking to BOYLE Sports, who offer the latest NBA betting, Professor Dr Rob Wilson - Director of Executive Education at University Campus of Football Business in London and a Professor of Applied Sports Finance - said: “From a sports finance perspective, Manchester United's entering NBA Europe could be a huge move. United is one of the world's most powerful sports brands, worth billions (around $8 billion) in equity and global reach. Attaching that brand to a new NBA Europe franchise creates immediate commercial upside for both parties.

“NBA Europe is being pitched as a solution to a European basketball market currently valued in the low hundreds of millions against an estimated $50 billion broader opportunity, meaning there is a huge gap between current value and potential commercial monetisation.

“United's involvement instantly elevates broadcast appeal, sponsorship interest, and merchandising pathways because global partners will pay ahead of scale when a club with United's footprint is involved. The upside is that the club diversifies income beyond football with a high-growth vertical that leverages NBA media rights and fan engagement, and the league gains one of the planet's most bankable sports brands to drive early adoption and valuation.”

Dr Wilson went on to say when asked to pick out the football clubs that could get involved with an NBA franchise: “Manchester United, Nottingham Forest, given their links to Olympiacos through owner Evangelos Marinakis and their existing netball franchise. Celtic, without question, with Rangers and Hibs running behind, but I would almost say Hibs before Rangers. After Forest, I do wonder about Leeds United and Arsenal, given their owners, followed by Chelsea and then Liverpool, in that order. Manchester City is an outside bet.”

He added on how NBA icons such as LeBron James - who holds a minority stake in Liverpool - and Steph Curry could help to accelerate basketball's growth in the UK, with NFL business already booming: “NBA London functions differently from the NFL's presence in the UK because basketball has far more room to grow from a smaller base.

“The NFL has achieved televised schedule success and regular-season games in London that underpin steady growth, whereas basketball is still a niche sport in the UK and wider Europe.

“However, that means there is upside potential that the NFL does not have and any increase in basketball's share of the sports entertainment wallet is incremental ‘new value' rather than redistribution of existing value.

“For local clubs like the London Lions, the arrival of NBA franchises, high-profile games featuring global stars, and an expanding NBA ecosystem can be largely beneficial rather than cannibalistic.

“It raises the sport's profile, draws new interest into domestic leagues and increases sponsorship appetite because brands can attach to a broader narrative arc including grassroots to elite pathways.

“The leverage of global icons like LeBron James or Steph Curry in marketing and events can accelerate this process and create commercial opportunities that were previously constrained by limited visibility.

“The real risk is managing the balance between global spectacle and local development so teams like the Lions can capture a share of the rising economic pie without being overshadowed by an imported product.”

United, who already have ambitious plans in place when it comes to a Premier League title win by 2028 and the construction of a new stadium, will likely explore the possibility of branching out into basketball circles. Their Glazer family ownership group already oversee events at NFL franchise the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

Existing NBA owners are said to have shown interest in buying stakes in European teams, with it being suggested that any investors will be able to spread purchase costs across several years.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Barcelona have confirmed the return of Portuguese star Joao Cancelo, who has rejoined the Catalan giants on a loan deal until the end of the season from Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal. The versatile full-back, who impressed during the 2023-24 campaign, was unveiled on Tuesday alongside president Joan Laporta and sporting director Deco, where it was revealed he will wear the No. 2 shirt for his second spell at the club.

The speculation has finally been put to bed with Barcelona confirming that Cancelo is once again a Blaugrana player. After a season and a half away from Catalonia, playing his football in the Middle East, the Portuguese international has secured a return to European football's top table. The club announced on Tuesday that an agreement had been reached with Al-Hilal for a loan move that will keep the defender at the club until the conclusion of the current campaign.

The signing ceremony was a high-profile affair held at the club's offices, underscoring the importance of this mid-season reinforcement. Perhaps the most notable detail for supporters eager to buy the new kit is the confirmation of his squad number. Cancelo has been handed the prestigious number 2 shirt, a jersey historically associated with some of the club's greatest defenders, including Dani Alves. It is a statement of intent from the player and the club, suggesting that he is expected to slot straight into the starting XI and command the right flank immediately.

This is not a step into the unknown for either party. Cancelo's previous tenure at Barcelona during the 2023-24 season remains fresh in the memory of the Camp Nou faithful. Joining on loan from Manchester City at the time, he quickly established himself as a vital cog in the machine, showcasing the technical quality that has defined his career.

During that solitary campaign, Cancelo was a fixture in the lineup, amassing 42 appearances across all competitions. His influence was felt on both ends of the pitch; he scored four goals and provided five assists. His ability to invert into midfield or overlap with devastating pace gave Barcelona a tactical fluidity they have arguably missed since his departure.

Following the expiry of that loan in June 2024, a permanent move failed to materialise, leading him to Al-Hilal. In the Saudi Pro League, he has remained highly active, featuring in 45 matches over the last 18 months. This consistent game time suggests he returns to Spain in peak physical condition, ready to hit the ground running without the need for a lengthy adaptation period.

Barca will hope re-signing of Cancelo proves a masterstroke in their efforts to retain their league crown and boost their hopes of Champions League success. He is comfortable operating on either the right or the left flank, a versatility that provides the manager with invaluable options as the fixture list becomes congested.

His time at Al-Hilal has kept him match-sharp, but the intensity of La Liga and the Champions League is a different beast. However, Barcelona's hierarchy is clearly convinced that the 31-year-old still possesses the elite-level quality required to make a difference in big games. The expectation is that he will primarily operate on the right, solving a position that has often been a headache for the club in recent years.

Cancelo's return to Barcelona is the latest chapter in a nomadic but illustrious career that has seen him represent some of the biggest clubs in world football. His journey began close to home with Benfica, where his precocious talent helped him lift a league title, a Portuguese Cup, a League Cup and a Super Cup early in his development.

His potential was quickly spotted by Valencia, who brought him to La Liga for a successful three-year stint that put him on the radar of Europe's giants. What followed was a tour of Italy's finest, with spells at Inter and Juventus seeing him mature into one of the world's best full-backs. It was at Juventus where he truly refined his defensive game to match his attacking instincts.

In the summer of 2019, he moved to Manchester City, enjoying a trophy-laden three-and-a-half-year spell under Pep Guardiola, which also included a loan to Bayern Munich. Having now returned from Saudi Arabia for a second bite at the cherry with Barcelona, Cancelo brings with him a wealth of experience and a winning mentality that the club will hope can drive them to silverware this season.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Chelsea cult hero N'Golo Kante in talks for shock return to Europe at one of Jose Mourinho's old clubs","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/chelsea-cult-hero-n-golo-kante-shock-return-europe-jose-mourinho-clubs/blt3f2d94e3cf21e699","Tue, 13 Jan 2026 12:19:39 GMT","

World Cup winner N'Golo Kante has emerged as the subject of a bold transfer approach from Turkish powerhouse Fenerbahce as he enters the final six months of his contract in Saudi Arabia. The former Chelsea midfielder has reportedly stalled on signing a new deal with Al-Ittihad, opening the door for a sensational European return, though his current club remain desperate to retain his services beyond the summer.

Kante, one of the most universally loved footballers of his generation, could be set for a surprise return to European football this month. Reports emerging from France suggest that Fenerbahce have launched a determined bid to bring the 34-year-old to Istanbul, hoping to capitalise on the uncertainty surrounding his future in the Saudi Pro League.

According to L'Equipe, the Turkish giants are eager to recruit the French international immediately, rather than waiting for his contract to expire in the summer. With the January transfer window open, Kante is now free to negotiate a pre-contract agreement with foreign clubs, but Fenerbahce's ambition extends to securing his signature for the second half of the current campaign.

The Istanbul club are looking to bolster their midfield options with a marquee signing. Kante fits the bill perfectly: a player of immense experience, tactical intelligence, and a pedigree that includes almost every major trophy available in the sport.

Fenerbahce have never been shy about targeting big names, and their interest in Kante signals a renewed intent to dominate domestically and compete in Europe. The report indicates that the club's directors are prepared to utilise a significant financial war chest to tempt the midfielder away from the Middle East.

While many assumed Kante's move to Saudi Arabia in 2023 signalled the winding down of his top-level career, his performances have remained at a high standard. He notably returned to the France squad for Euro 2024, proving he still possesses the engine and defensive awareness that made him a legend at Leicester City and Chelsea.

Fenerbahce's strategy appears to be twofold: convince Al-Ittihad to sell for a nominal fee now to avoid losing him for nothing, and persuade Kante that a fresh challenge in the cauldron of the Sukru Saracoglu Stadium is the perfect twilight chapter for his career. The prospect of European football and the passionate Turkish fanbase could prove an alluring alternative to extending his stay in Jeddah.

However, the transfer is far from straightforward. Al-Ittihad have no desire to part ways with one of their most consistent performers. Since arriving from Chelsea, Kante has been a pivotal figure for the club, bringing stability and class to their midfield.

The Saudi side are reportedly working hard to convince Kante to sign a contract extension. They view him as integral to their project and are keen to avoid the PR blow of losing a high-profile star back to Europe whilst he is still performing well. Yet, L'Équipe notes that Kante has ""not responded favourably"" to the initial offers of a renewal.

This silence has spoken volumes to interested parties. By holding off on signing a new deal, Kante has effectively invited offers, signalling that he is considering his options. If Al-Ittihad sense that he is determined to leave in June for free, they may be forced to consider Fenerbahce's winter proposal to recoup some value, although financial necessity is rarely a driving force for the PIF-backed clubs.

During his seven years at Stamford Bridge, the tireless midfielder cemented his status as a cult hero and one of the Premier League's greatest-ever imports.

His trophy haul in London was exhaustive, including the Premier League, FA Cup, Europa League and the Champions League, where he was named Man of the Match in the final against Manchester City. His humility off the pitch, combined with his relentless work rate on it, made him a favourite not just among Blues supporters, but football fans globally.

Fenerbahce may be the first to show their hand, but they are unlikely to be the only suitors. A player of Kante's calibre becoming available as a free agent in the summer - or for a reduced fee in January - is a market opportunity that few sporting directors will ignore.

With the 2026 World Cup in North America on the horizon later this year, Kante will be acutely aware of the need to maintain a high level of performance to remain in Didier Deschamps' plans for Les Bleus. While the Saudi Pro League has improved, a return to the intensity of European competition could solidify his spot in the national team for one last major tournament.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Aleksandar Vukic halted Stefanos Tsitsipas' promising start to 2026 in style on Tuesday night at the Adelaide International, where he produced a poised and timely performance to prevail 7-6(3), 7-6(5).

Tsitsipas went 3-0 at the United Cup last week and appeared revitalised following a turbulent 2025 season during which he fell out of the Top 20 for the first time since 2018. Yet Vukic, who came through qualifying at his home ATP 250, met the challenge head-on, feeding off a lively atmosphere to level their Lexus ATP Head2Head series at 1-1.

Victory for Vukic 🇦🇺Aleksandar Vukic defeats Tsitsipas 7-6, 7-6 to advance in Adelaide!@AdelaideTennis | #AdelaideTennis pic.twitter.com/nnnFlPQxjd

“I was talking to my team today [about how] I am just in awe of this stadium and the cricket ground that's just here,” Vukic said of the Memorial Drive Tennis Centre. “This centre court is very special, and it's pretty packed. I appreciate the support, everyone helping me out tonight. It was an awesome win for me.”

The Australian saved all four break points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats, and was clinical when it mattered most. In the second-set tie-break, Vukic reeled off six of the final eight points from 1/3 down to seal the one-hour, 53-minute triumph — his 21st over a Top 50 opponent.

Vukic, the No. 87 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, will next face doubles star Andrea Vavassori, who also came through qualifying to upset Gabriel Diallo 6-3, 7-6(4). Last year, Vavassori won the Adelaide doubles title with partner Simone Bolelli and is a two-time Nitto ATP Finals competitor.





Earlier, Tomas Machac downed Australian wild card James Duckworth 6-3, 6-3 for his first tour-level win since Shanghai in October. The eighth seed next meets qualifier Quentin Halys, who beat lucky loser Jacob Fearnley 6-3, 6-4.

In an all-Australian wild-card clash, Rinky Hijikata defeated Tristan Schoolkate 6-4, 6-4 to set up a second-round encounter with top seed Alejandro Davidovich Fokina.

Casper Ruud knows all too well that past success counts for little in a men's game being rewritten in real time by fearless shotmakers.

The Norwegian has climbed as high as No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings and reached three major finals, but in the past two years, Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have combined to win all eight Grand Slam titles. Meanwhile, a new wave — spearheaded by 19-year-old Joao Fonseca and 20-year-old Jakub Mensik — has continued to surge. Watching the evolution closely has given Ruud time to reflect on his own path.

“Seeing how the game has changed has made me realise that maybe I need to change my game a little,” Ruud said in a pre-tournament press conference in Auckland on Monday. “Trying to look for improvements, I have been studying a lot of the younger guys over the last weeks and months how my game needs to develop to handle their type of tennis.”

Ruud has built his career on heavy topspin, physical consistency and point construction, particularly from the forehand wing on clay. Yet against the game's new elite, time is often taken away before those patterns can fully develop.

That challenge has been reflected in his Lexus ATP Head2Head record against Alcaraz and Sinner. The 27-year-old owns just one win from six meetings with Alcaraz — at the 2024 Nitto ATP Finals — and he is still searching for his first victory against Sinner after four defeats. The margins, Ruud believes, are defined by firepower on both sides of the ball, not just one.

“The generation consists of Sinner as the oldest one, then you can go down to Fonseca, who is the youngest one. In that age group, between five and six years, they really rip the ball and play a different style of tennis,” explained 14-time ATP Tour champion Ruud. “That's something I've needed to get used to.

“They don't just have one big shot, they typically have two: both the forehand and backhand are great. If you look at Mensik, I lost against him last week at the United Cup. He has a great serve and hits the backhand hard from both sides. You see it more and more.”





Ruud earned his first win of the 2026 season against home favourite Alex de Minaur at the United Cup in Sydney before falling to Mensik in a tight two-set match. The Norwegian now arrives at the ASB Classic in Auckland as the second seed, intent on applying those lessons immediately.

In a draw in which he could face Mensik again in the semi-finals, Ruud's study sessions may soon turn into reality, and it could reveal just how his evolving game can match up in a new ATP Tour era.

Gael Monfils waved goodbye to the ASB Classic on Tuesday, when the defending champion bowed out in three sets in his final appearance in Auckland.

The 39-year-old Frenchman began his farewell 2026 season by returning to the tournament where he made history last year. Monfils, who in 2025 became the oldest man to win a tour-level title since 1977, was honoured with a personalised Maori spear (taiaha) after his 5-7, 6-3, 6-4 defeat to Fabian Marozsan.

“I have great memories here. I have been playing here since an early age,” said Monfils, who made his first Auckland appearance in 2007. “I came when I was 20 and I'm finishing in my 40s… It's been a long ride. It's been a big honour for me to play here, a special country with great culture. I was fortunate to win this title. Auckland has a special place in my heart.”

Last week, Monfils watched his wife Elina Svitolina match his achievement from last year by claiming the WTA 250 title in Auckland. At her trophy ceremony, Svitolina said: “Before the tournament, he told me it would be amazing if we both won the same tournament. I always had it in the back of my mind.”

For Marozsan, Tuesday's win marked his second victory over Monfils in Auckland and levelled their Lexus ATP Head2Head series at 2-2. The Hungarian can now look forward to a second-round clash with second seed Casper Ruud.

Alex Michelsen and Marcos Giron also advanced on Tuesday in Auckland, where they set an all-American meeting. Michelsen, who reached the Brisbane semi-finals last week, overcame Mariano Navone 2-6, 6-2, 7-5, while Hong Kong semi-finalist Giron beat Alexandre Muller 6-2, 6-2.

For more than three years, Craig Boynton coached John Isner, the former No. 8 player in the PIF ATP Rankings. Now, the American is working with the player most commonly compared to Isner: 6'11” Reilly Opelka.

Opelka has long learned from former World No. 7 Jay Berger, who remains a key part of his team. But he will now travel with Boynton, who most recently developed Hubert Hurkacz into a Top-10 player.

“He's one of the best coaches in the world and I think between him and Jay Berger, I'm incredibly lucky,” Opelka told ATPTour.com. “These are just great guys, great people, smart, tennis geniuses, tennis experts.” 

It is important to note that despite both Isner and Opelka ranking among the very best servers in history, they are not clones. Perhaps their greatest similarity is that they jokingly refer to themselves as “servebots”.

“They're two different people. Ultimately, every tennis player here has the same goal and everybody has different skill sets,” Boynton said. “Obviously, people are going to look at the similarities between Reilly and John, but they are different players. 

“Yes, they have some similarities, but they're different in just about every way. They're just different people, they're different players, ultimately trying to do the same thing, but doing it in different ways.”





Last week in his first tournament of the season, Opelka obliterated 44 aces, the most he has ever hit in a three-set match on the ATP Tour. The problem was that the 28-year-old lost a final-set tie-break to Kamil Majchrzak.

That made his victory Monday against Alexei Popyrin at the Adelaide International even sweeter. The four-time ATP Tour titlist, who missed nearly two years after hip and wrist surgeries, is excited to kickstart his year.

“Especially after last week I had a really, really rough loss that could linger,” Opelka said. “[That is] something you don't get over quickly. Maybe 10 years it takes to get over one of those. So, happy that I got a win.”

Tatjana Maria defeats Venus Williams in a historic match at the Hobart International, showcasing her slice-centered game in windy conditions. Maria's win over 45-year-old Williams came after a tough loss to 17-year-old Emerson Jones in Brisbane.

Germany's Tatjana Maria defeated Venus Williams 6-4, 6-3 on Tuesday in the first round of the Hobart International, a match that carried historic weight on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz.

Hobart: Scores | Draws | Order of play

The first career meeting between the two produced the oldest combined age in a WTA Tour match since the circuit's founding in 1973, with Maria competing at 38 and Williams at 45. The mother of two broke serve five times in the 1-hour, 27-minute victory, using her slice-heavy game to full effect in windy conditions on Day 2 of main-draw play in Tasmania.

The win marked Maria's first of the season, coming one week after she was upset by 17-year-old Emerson Jones in the opening round of the Brisbane International -- a result that may have landed less comfortably at home, given that Williams is one of the favorite players of Maria's daughters, Charlotte, 12, and Cecilia, 4.

Maria joked afterward the girls profess the former World No. 1 to be one of their favorite players -- though she hoped they were rooting for her.

""Everybody loves Venus -- I love her too!"" said Maria, who makes her family home near Williams in Florida. ""For me, to play her was such an honor because I never played her before. It was not easy with all the wind but it was amazing.""

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

Maria's win capped what proved to be a difficult day for the two major champions that featured on Hobart's order of play.

Earlier, Barbora Krejcikova was slowed by knee trouble in a 2-hour and 32-minute contest against Peyton Stearns -- the American's first victory since the US Open. The Czech received a medical timeout after the first set and carried on admirably over an eventual 6-4, 1-6, 7-6(3) defeat.

Stearns served for the match twice in the final set, and missed two match points, before she converted her third chance for victory in the tiebreak. 

Other winners on Day 2 in Hobart included third seed Iva Jovic, who like Bondar won the first 11 games of her 6-0, 6-1 romp against Indonesia's Janice Tjen, Magdalena Frech, who pulled away in a 6-4, 6-0 win over France's Elsa Jacquemot; and Slovakia's Rebecca Sramkova, a three-set winner against Jacquemot's countrywoman Varvara Gracheva.

However, No. 1 seed Emma Raducanu's opener against Camila Osorio was rained off with the Briton leading 6-3, 2-4, deuce. Raducanu's solidity had seen her take the first set over the less consistent Osorio, but the Colombian hit her stride to take a 4-1 lead in the second set.

After two short pauses for drizzle, the first extended off-court delay came as Raducanu served at 4-2, 15-30 in the second set. On resumption, the pair managed to play only three points -- all ended with clean winners -- before play was called for the day.

Moments that made us laugh and cry in 2025

Jack Doohan is leaving the Alpine set-up following a short-lived F1 promotion in 2025.

Alpine have announced that they are parting ways with Jack Doohan ahead of the 2026 season, ending a whirlwind experience for the Australian at the team.

Doohan, son of five-time 500cc motorcycling World Champion Mick, joined the Alpine Academy in 2022, before taking on reserve duties for 2023 and classifying third in that year's F2 championship.

An unexpected debut came at the end of the 2024 campaign in Abu Dhabi, when Alpine split with Esteban Ocon a round early, before the youngster was given the chance to step up full-time for 2025.

However, Doohan's time alongside Pierre Gasly lasted just six more rounds, with Alpine – following several waves of speculation and media reports – deciding to bring in former Williams super-sub Franco Colapinto as his replacement.

While the change was initially described as a seat “rotation”, Alpine stuck with the Argentinian racer for the rest of the season, while Doohan – demoted to test and reserve duties – watched from the sidelines.

A couple of weeks into 2026, and following a caption-less tribute post from Doohan at the end of last year, Alpine released a statement confirming that the driver and team have now gone their separate ways.

“BWT Alpine Formula One Team confirms it has reached a mutual agreement with Jack Doohan to not continue his driving services with the team for the 2026 FIA Formula One World Championship season and allow him to pursue other career opportunities,” read the statement.

“Jack became the first member of the Alpine Academy to graduate into a race seat with the team when he made his Grand Prix debut at the 2024 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

“The team would like to thank Jack for his commitment and professionalism to the team for the past four years, both on and off track, and wishes him all the best for the future.”

Doohan's next move is yet to be revealed, though he was seen testing Super Formula machinery in the closing months of 2025.

Alpine, meanwhile, still have former F2 racer Paul Aron to call on in a back-up role – the Estonian making several test and practice outings through 2025 in support of Gasly and Colapinto.

The American squad are making their Formula 1 debut this season, with experienced duo Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez returning to the grid to form their line-up.

Cadillac will unveil the livery for their inaugural F1 campaign on February 8 during the Super Bowl, a few days before official pre-season testing begins in Bahrain, hence the special edition livery for the Barcelona running that takes place between 26-30 January.

The one-off livery features a monochrome concept with geometric pattern in a gloss and matte sequence plus a large Cadillac crest draped over the rear to help disguise the aero surfaces.

It is traditional for teams to run these camouflaged liveries in testing in a bid to mask aerodynamic details ahead of the season start, particularly ahead of a season when there have been sweeping changes to the regulations.

In a nice touch, the team have also incorporated the names of the founding members of the team from both the United States and the UK into the design.

President of General Motors Mark Reuss said: “Our new testing livery celebrates Detroit's design heritage and the power of the global Cadillac Formula 1 team, while keeping our design secrets under wraps.

""The Barcelona test is just the beginning – we can't wait to share our official race livery with fans around the world next month.”

CEO Dan Towriss added: ""The Cadillac Formula 1 Team is committed to innovation on and off the track. TWG combined with General Motors allows us to rethink the norm and introduce the team in bold new ways.

""Debuting our race livery during a globally televised championship broadcast challenges convention and brings Cadillac Formula 1 to a global audience.

""Paired with this special-edition testing livery designed by the GM Design studios, we're honoring automotive heritage while looking ahead as we build toward the 2026 season.”

Cadillac are expected to shakedown their car at Silverstone this month ahead of heading to Barcelona for the all-team shakedown.

How drivers will adapt in 2026

Moments that made us laugh and cry in 2025

F1.com runs through the top-10 list of the youngest drivers to ever compete in the sport.

Arvid Lindblad will become the fourth-youngest driver in F1 history when he debuts for Racing Bulls at the 2026 Australian Grand Prix, aged 18 years and seven months old. But who currently makes the top 10 in the sport's all-time list, and what happened after their respective debut weekends? F1.com has the answers…

Tuero's deal with Minardi for 1998 led to plenty of chatter in the F1 paddock, given that the Argentinian youngster did not meet all of the FIA's Super Licence requirements, but the governing body ultimately allowed him to contest the season.

It was a difficult year running around at the back for the Buenos Aires native, who managed to experience a home Grand Prix weekend but otherwise finished just four out of 16 races – telling Minardi afterwards that he would be walking away from the sport.

Alonso was one of three future stars to debut in F1 in 2001, alongside Kimi Raikkonen and Juan Pablo Montoya, with the Spaniard – like Tuero – starting out at backmarker team Minardi but still managing to show his potential over the course of the campaign.

He stepped back to a reserve role with Renault the following year (his manager Flavio Briatore running that team), before returning full-time in 2003 to claim his first pole positions, Grand Prix wins and build towards a breakthrough 2005/2006 championship double for the French manufacturer.

Alonso has since experienced stints with varying levels of success at McLaren, Ferrari, Renault's rebranded Alpine team and, most recently, Aston Martin, but the now 44-year-old – the oldest driver on the current F1 grid – continues to chase that elusive third world title.

Rodriguez was a talented cyclist and motorcyclist growing up and seamlessly transferred those skills when he started racing cars – becoming the youngest person to stand on the overall podium at the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the youngest person to start an F1 race in quick succession.

He qualified a brilliant second during a guest appearance with Ferrari at Monza in 1961 and returned for several Grands Prix the following year, only to be involved in a fatal crash – aged just 20 – while practicing for a non-championship race in a Rob Walker-entered Lotus at home in Mexico.

It was a similar story for Rodriguez's brother, Pedro, who enjoyed success in sportscars and F1 but also lost his life while competing in an Interserie event at the Norisring in 1971 – Mexico City's circuit thus being named in their honour as the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez.

Thackwell took F1's youngest starter record from the late Rodriguez at the 1980 Canadian Grand Prix, making his first official appearance for Tyrrell – alongside full-time European F2 duties – after failing to qualify with Arrows in the Netherlands earlier that season.

He made one more Grand Prix start with RAM in 1984, the same year in which the New Zealander claimed the F2 title, before trying his hand at a range of other categories across the single-seaters and endurance worlds – winning prestigious races such as the Pau Grand Prix and Nürburgring 1000km.

Norris was signed by McLaren while climbing the single-seater ranks, spending 2018 as the team's test and reserve driver and appearing in plenty of Friday practice sessions, before being given a full-time chance for 2019 alongside another new signing in Carlos Sainz.

After scoring a solid haul of points in his debut season, Norris achieved a maiden podium at the 2020 opener and topped up his tally through 2021, 2022 and 2023, when a revitalised, restructured McLaren started to emerge as a genuine front-running force.

In 2024, Norris landed an emotional first win at the Miami Grand Prix and added three more over the course of the season as McLaren grew stronger and stronger, before taking the next step through 2025 and earning his maiden F1 Drivers' title.

Alguersuari is another Red Bull junior to be involved in a mid-season swap, earning promotion to Toro Rosso in place of Sebastien Bourdais at the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix while contesting Formula Renault 3.5 – a campaign he completed despite his new F1 commitments.

He continued for the 2010 and 2011 seasons, collecting more than 30 points across that period and recording a best finish of seventh on two occasions, but was dropped by Red Bull chiefs for 2012 and could not put a deal together to return with another team.

Alguersuari continued his motorsport career in Formula E and GT competition, only to fall out of love with the sport, retire from racing altogether and turn his attention to making music – he now produces and performs as DJ ‘Squire' (a nod to his second surname Escudero).

Bearman burst onto the F1 scene at the 2024 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, with the Ferrari junior – who had already claimed F2 pole position at the Jeddah Corniche Circuit – being drafted in to replace the unwell Sainz from final practice onwards.

Despite that limited running, the Briton started a very respectable 11th on the grid and climbed to a fine seventh position on race day, while eclipsing the late Ricardo Rodriguez's record as the youngest driver to enter a Grand Prix for the Scuderia.

Another two races came the Briton's way in 2024, as he turned out for Ferrari-powered Haas in Azerbaijan and Brazil as a substitute for Kevin Magnussen, before he graduated to F1 full-time with the United States-based squad last season.

Antonelli was a new addition to this list in 2025, when the Italian completed a particularly rapid motorsport ascent – going from F4 to Formula Regional to F2 and then F1 with Mercedes in the space of four years.

After a painful Q1 exit, Antonelli made headlines on his Grand Prix debut in Australia by superbly rising from 16th to fourth in tricky, mixed weather conditions, showcasing some of the potential many at the Silver Arrows had been waxing lyrical about.

An up-and-down year followed, with highs of a Sprint pole position and three podium finishes punctuated by some mid-season struggles, but he ultimately did more than enough to keep his spot for 2026 and the all-new regulations.

Stroll was a member of Ferrari's junior programme early in his career but departed ahead of the 2016 season – when he won the European F3 title – to become a Williams test driver, which involved extensive F1 preparation in older machinery at tracks around the world.

He stepped into a full-time seat for 2017 with support from billionaire businessman father Lawrence, quashing some of the doubts around that promotion via a maiden points finish at home in Canada, an impressive podium in Azerbaijan and a second row start in the rain at Monza.

Lawrence's subsequent takeover of Force India saw Stroll junior move to new surroundings at the rebranded Racing Point, where he claimed a shock pole position at the 2020 Turkish Grand Prix, before the team morphed into the Aston Martin operation he still represents today.

Verstappen tops the all-time youngest starter list with a spectacular rise to the top echelon, the Dutchman completing just one season of single-seater racing before joining Red Bull's junior line-up and making his F1 debut for Toro Rosso in 2015 as a 17-year-old.

While his talent was still raw, Red Bull knew they had someone special on their hands and, as covered above, promoted Verstappen to the main team just a handful of races into the 2016 season – an immediate victory in Spain setting the scene for the years ahead.

Fast forward to 2026 and the 28-year-old is a four-time World Champion – behind only Juan Manuel Fangio, Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton  – with 48 pole positions, 71 Grand Prix wins, 127 podium finishes and almost 3,500 points to his name.

How drivers will adapt in 2026

Moments that made us laugh and cry in 2025

Across almost two decades in Formula 1, Lewis Hamilton has redefined what it means to be a successful F1 driver – not only through his record-breaking successes on track, but through fearless self-expression away from it. Hamilton's fashion journey reflects his growing confidence, cultural influence and desire to challenge convention. This is the story of how F1's most successful driver became one of its most recognisable style icons.

Sir Lewis Hamilton celebrated his 41st birthday last week as he heads into his 20th season in Formula 1 – almost unprecedented longevity. The Briton is a seven-time World Champion, but over the last decade, his sartorial style and influence in the world of fashion has rivalled his legacy in motorsport.

Hamilton continues to explore and evolve his identity through his clothing, describing his relationship with fashion as ""like air in your lungs."" Just in the past year, the Ferrari driver has achieved some incredible feats, including co-chairing the Met Gala with Colman Domingo, A$AP Rocky, and Pharrell Williams, with a theme he had been developing with ex-Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour for three years.

To mark his latest milestone, let's take a look back at some of Hamilton's most eye-catching eras and looks.

When Hamilton joined McLaren in 2007, the world of F1 was very different. Driver brands were less common, so showing personality through things such as fashion was atypical – drivers instead were expected to wear team kit over race weekends.

Speaking to Vogue, Hamilton described this period of fashion as 'horrible', admitting that he had to 'break some rules' to bring his own style to F1. In fact, he'd sometimes dress one way at the track, before changing into something more individual in his rental car just to feel more himself.

But this constrained beginning to his personal fashion didn't last long. By 2010, Hamilton had begun to introduce tailored pieces into his wardrobe. Fitted blazers and designer jeans became staples of this era as his style slowly evolved into bold high-end fashion statements.

2015 marked his entrance into the world of high fashion with his first of many invitations to the Met Gala. Appearing with Topshop, Hamilton wore an electric blue three-piece suit to fit the 'China: Through the Looking Glass' theme – a first big step into the fashion industry for the Briton.

It wasn't until Hamilton began working with famed stylist Law Roach that his sense of style really came out of the shadows. Law Roach is probably best known for working with Zendaya for the movie Challengers, but his work with Hamilton has been revolutionary. Law and Hamilton experimented with bolder looks, incorporating complex patterns, oversized silhouettes, and statement accessories that played with proportions in ways the F1 paddock had never seen before.

Hamilton's Met Gala appearances most notably define this era. In 2016, he arrived in a striking blue-patterned Dolce & Gabbana tuxedo. Two years later, for 2018 'Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination' theme, he wore an all-white Tommy Hilfiger suit to capture the theme's ethereal quality. And it was the 2019 'Camp: Notes on Fashion' theme that saw Hamilton fully embrace the event's playful spirit with a metallic two-piece featuring zig-zag embroidery.

The defining moment of this era came in 2021, when Hamilton wore a custom Kenneth Nicholson ensemble featuring a black suit with a sheer lace train, a powerful tribute to Black designers. But the fashion statement extended beyond his own outfit. Hamilton purchased a table and invited emerging Black designers, including Edvin Thompson, Nicholson, and Jason Rembert, using his platform to create opportunities for underrepresented voices.

Another of Hamilton's notable looks came at the 2024 'The Garden of Time'-themed gala, where he paid homage to Britain's first recorded Black gardener, John Ystumllyn, by wearing an all-black Burberry ensemble. The coat featured thorns along the neckline, representing the pain of the slave trade, with a poem by Black poet Alex Wharton, ""The Gardener,"" embroidered inside.

The 2024 season was to be Hamilton's last with Mercedes, the team who had become his family over the course of 12 years and six World Championships. Going out with a bang, Hamilton pulled off some killer looks throughout the season.

There was a custom Marni pink-and-bone bomber jacket with BigFoot 2.0 sneakers at the Miami Grand Prix, followed by a Gucci Fall 2024 embroidered tank, a blue Dior knit for Monaco, and a crisp Zegna Spring 2024 look paired with white boat shoes from Marsell in Spain.

To mark the end of his time with Mercedes and the highly anticipated move to Ferrari, the seven-time World Champion ended the season with a trio of looks that visually depicted this transition.

For the 2024 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix media day, he wore a full white Willy Chavarria look that represented his time with the Silver Arrows. Ahead of qualifying, he arrived at the paddock wearing a Rick Owens jacket with a white-to-red ombre, signaling the change of teams. Then, on race day, he was bathed in Ferrari red, wearing a custom outfit by Kim Jones for Dior.

It's evident that to Hamilton, fashion is more than looking good – it is a way to pay homage and communicate feelings. Even his former engineer Pete Bonnington got in on the action, wearing one of Hamilton's more daring looks as a parting gesture!

At Mercedes, Hamilton was the star. He had carved his own path and had the confidence and clarity to showcase who he was on his terms. His relationship with Toto Wolff was strong, so he had room to use fashion as a form of expression.

Moving to Ferrari meant Hamilton had to start over with a new team for the first time in over a decade. When Hamilton arrived in Maranello, his first Ferrari photo broke the internet. He posed outside Enzo Ferrari's house alongside a classic Ferrari F40, wearing a three-piece Ferragamo suit. His stance and outfit choices showed respect to the team's history – the weight of the Ferrari legacy firmly on his shoulders.

2025 was also the year F1 The Movie was released, a film that Hamilton had a large part in producing – and it deserved an equally memorable look. For the New York premiere, the 41-year-old wore pieces from the Dior collection that he designed himself.

Hamilton donned team kit frequently last season, but some exciting exceptions included an all-white three-piece Calvin Klein suit styled by Eric McNeal for Monaco, paired with Timberland six-inch boots, juxtaposing classic Riviera charm with streetwear, and a Maison Margiela Canadian Tuxedo for the Canadian Grand Prix.

He wore a heritage-themed Burberry look with a gabardine trench vest and cargo trousers decorated with Union Jack Swarovski crystals for Silverstone, paired with a stunning £1.5 million Richard Mille watch. Finally, Hamilton ended the season in Look 16 from Ferrari Style's Spring/Summer 2026 collection by Rocco Iannone: a sleeveless, structured utility vest with oversized cargo trousers.

Hamilton's contribution to fashion peaked when he co-chaired the Met Gala for the first time in 2025. The Ferrari driver revealed he was among the first to start talking with Anna Wintour about the 'Superfine: Tailoring Black Style' theme three years earlier.

As someone who is such an advocate for Black creatives, this theme felt especially fitting. Hamilton exceeded expectations by appearing in a custom suit created in collaboration with London-based designer Grace Wales Bonner and styled by McNeal, featuring a cropped ivory jacket, striped tuxedo trousers, and a meticulously embroidered sash.

The veteran has inspired a new generation of drivers, including Zhou Guanyu and Pierre Gasly, who have cited Hamilton as opening doors for younger drivers to express themselves. Fashion brand executive Rocco Iannone has even noted that ""F1 is the new red carpet.""

Hamilton explained that fashion helped him feel more like himself in F1's initially non-diverse environment, noting it gave him confidence to show up in his own gear. What started as an act of rebellion against conformity has transformed into an impressive legacy in the sphere of fashion.

The joint venture with OBB Media is launching with a Tom Brady docuseries, a deal to produce the ESPY Awards and deals with LA28, MLB and the WWE.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


Fanatics, the Michael Rubin-led sports juggernaut, is getting into the entertainment business in a major way.


	The company is partnering with OBB Media to launch a new joint venture, Fanatics Studios, with a flurry of major deals lined up to support the studio at launch, including with LA28, ESPN, WWE and MLB. The venture plans to produce live events, unscripted and scripted original series, feature films and digital content.




	“I'm allergic to thin, vanity shingle announcements. So much work needs to go on behind the scenes to make a project real,” says OBB Media founder and CEO Michael D. Ratner, who will also lead Fanatics Studios. “We're not here announcing development deals, we want to talk about what we're really doing.”

	“I think that when you look at the work that's been done pre-launch, it amounts to over nine figures in revenue in year one of the business,” Ratner adds. “We really wanted to go and become the mainstay player and the preeminent sports content studio.”




			Related Video		







	The deals that the company has lined up include a strategic partnership with the LA28 Olympic and Paralympic Games, with plans to produce a slew of content around the event, including an official Olympics film, with Ratner promising a theatrical release.


	And it includes a major content deal with ESPN, which sees Fanatics Studios join the sports media giant and Full Day Production as a producer of the 2026 ESPY Awards. Fanatics Studios will also produce hours of additional content for ESPN over the next two years, including further installments of its Fanatics Fest docuseries, which debuted last year.

	











	Fanatics and OBB Media first joined forces for Fanatics Fest, the live event in New York that brings together sports and pop culture, with OBB producing the docuseries. They also previously announced plans for the Fanatics Flag Football Classic, which will be played in Saudi Arabia and will see Tom Brady come out of retirement. That event will air on Fox.


	However, the company also said Tuesday that it was working on a docuseries following Brady as he comes out of retirement to play in the flag football event, and gears up to potentially make a push for the 2028 Olympics, where flag football will be a sport.


	“I think if I had to highlight what's inherent to the DNA of the business that Michael and I intend to build here, it's really about creating IP that could then be the beneficiary of the Fanatics ecosystem and flywheel,” Ratner says. “And we want to create big, sticky, repeatable franchises, formats that have annuity value, and the Flag Football Classic is a perfect example of that. So I think you should expect to see a lot more of that.”


	The company also announced deals with the WWE and MLB, with Fanatics Studios becoming a partner for many of WWE's digital shows and podcasts, including What Do You Wanna Talk About with Cody Rhodes, Six Feet Under with The Undertaker, What's Your Story? with Steph McMahon and The Raw Recap Show hosted by Megan Morant and Sam Roberts, with plans for a new food travel show called YEE(A)T with the Usos, featuring brothers Jimmy and Jey Uso.

	











	The MLB deal will also include a slate of content around the sport, beginning with a docuseries around the 2026 World Baseball Classic.


	Rubin, of course, is one of the most connected people on planet earth, particularly when it comes to power players in the world of sports and popular culture.


	“Michael's a dream partner. He's got these amazing relationships,” Ratner says. “I think that our vision for this studio is that we're going to be able to draw upon the many different businesses that Fanatics is in… I think Michael's an incredible thought partner, he's an incredible strategist, he's an incredible networker, so I think we'll draw on Michael's ability to do all of that stuff.”


	“I'm incredibly excited about launching Fanatics Studios and adding an important content and media business to our growing sports platform that also supports all of our existing businesses,” says Rubin in a statement. “We could not have dreamed up a better partner in Michael Ratner and the team at OBB, and together we are going to continue pushing our mission of relentlessly enhancing the fan experience by creating content that brings fans closer than ever to the teams, players, sports, cultural moments and events that they love in a way that's never been done before.”


	Fanatics, of course, is trying to carve out its own piece of the sports ecosystem, leveraging Rubin's vast rolodex. It is a dominant player in merchandise and apparel, and bought a dominant stake in the collectibles business through a deal with former Disney CEO Michael Eisner's Topps.

	











	It is also in the sports betting space and recently expanded into prediction markets. In other words, if it touches sports, Fanatics is in the business. And there is no question that sports and sports-adjacent content have been in high demand in recent years.


	OBB Media, meanwhile, has forged a path as an independent studio at a challenging time for the business, with shows that include Kevin Hart's Cold as Balls and Speed Goes Pro featuring iShowSpeed.


	“It's been a long time coming, but over a lot of 2025 we were head down working on this, having the conversations at the highest level with many of the leagues that you see, with many of the networks,” Ratner says. “We've been really trying to make this impactful.”

The buzzy Hulu drama, created by Meaghan Oppenheimer, stars Grace Van Patten and Jackson White.



		By Carly Thomas, Jackie Strause 

	January 12, 2026 9:00pm	




Tell Me Lies fans: Hulu has a surprise for you.


	Instead of having to wait another week for more intoxicating drama from Lucy (Grace Van Patten) and Stephen (Jackson White), the streamer has dropped a third episode along with the show's two-episode return.




	The third episode of the highly anticipated third season, titled “Repent,” is also now available to stream along with the planned first two episodes — titled “You F*cked It, Friend” and “We Can't Help It If We Are A Problem.”

	The new season follows the jaw-dropping season two finale that ended (spoiler alert!) with Stephen (White) sending Lucy's best friend and bride Bree (Cat Missal) a voice recording of Bree's groom, Evan (Branden Cook), confessing that he slept with Lucy (Van Patten) back in college. Their one-night tryst was known to viewers, but not to Bree, who was finding out right before she is set to walk down the aisle and marry Evan during the show's 2015-set timeline.

	











	The third season, per Hulu, will follow Lucy and Stephen as they've rekindled their toxic romance in time for spring semester at Baird College in the show's past timeline. But no matter what, chaos and controversy will always follow them: Will they be able to move past previous indiscretions that continue to haunt their relationships? As for the rest of the friends group, they must face their own destructive behaviors and accept the repercussions, all while scandalous secrets spreading around campus threatens everyone in Lucy's circle with vicious consequences.


Tell Me Lies, created by Meaghan Oppenheimer, also stars Spencer House, Sonia Mena, Alicia Crowder and Costa D'Angelo.

	











	The rest of season three will be released weekly until the finale on Feb. 17. Check out all of The Hollywood Reporter‘s Tell Me Lies coverage here.

Snow stars alongside Malin Akerman in the buzzy Netflix drama.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


	Fans of The Hunting Wives, be prepared to feel all the emotions in the highly anticipated second season.


Brittany Snow, who plays Sophie O'Neil in the Rebecca Cutter-created Netflix show, recently teased to Entertainment Tonight at the 2026 Golden Globes that there's a “wild” death in the forthcoming season, which also stars Malin Akerman as Margo Banks.




	“Wild. Every script is a new adventure. They said that we couldn't top last year and somehow I think we are doing it,” the actress shared. “I'm surprised. And I even knew what was coming a little bit. So I think people are going to be very shocked, I think people are going to be angry. I think people are going to be surprised and excited.”

	“I don't know if that's a good or bad thing to say, but definitely people should watch,” she added.


Filming for The Hunting Wives season two is currently underway. Season one, based on May Cobb's bestselling novel of the same name, follows Sophie as she and her family move from Boston to a small town in Texas. She quickly grows close — maybe too close — to a socialite, Margo, and becomes consumed by obsession, seduction and murder. 


	When Snow was asked for her craziest reaction when she first read the season two script, the actress responded, “I stood up on my couch. Someone dies. I won't tell you who. That is a wild play. Wild behavior.”

	











	And if fans thought The Hunting Wives couldn't get more scandalous, Snow teased elsewhere on the Globes red carpet that season two will also include “more steamy” scenes.

Kelly, who hosts 'The Megyn Kelly Show,' previously shared that she withdrew her podcast from consideration for the new awards category.

	It seems Megyn Kelly doesn't agree with the winner of the best podcast award at the 2026 Golden Globes.


Amy Poehler won the inaugural award at the ceremony Sunday night for her Good Hang podcast. However, not even 24 hours later, Kelly took to Monday's episode of The Megyn Kelly Show to rip into the comedian and her interview-style podcast.




	“Amy Poehler won. That's no shock, they gave it to one of their own,” Kelly said. “Yeah, tracks. And it's because she really has a really, really insightful podcast, which you really feel enriched after watching. I mean, I've never watched it, but this is what I hear, and when I watch the clips, I thought, ‘My God, what am I missing?'”

	After showing a recent clip from the Good Hang podcast, with guest Gwyneth Paltrow, Kelly added in a sarcastic tone, “They're so relatable. They have busy lives. They get tired earlier, just like you, stars like Gwyneth Paltrow, just like you. Riveting, right? Well, maybe she won because of her insightful interviews — no, wait, that wasn't it, the preparation she does, perhaps.”


	“Amy Poehler thought Gwyneth Paltrow was in Cold Mountain, which she wasn't,” she continued. “They played it off, like it was hilarious. But the truth is, she didn't show Gwyneth Paltrow the respect of actually understanding what her body of work is, recent body of work, for them to discuss. So that's embarrassing and disrespectful, and that's what wins you, yay, the award for best podcast.”


Good Hang beat out Armchair Expert With Dax Shepard, Alex Cooper's Call Her Daddy, The Mel Robbins Podcast, SmartLess, hosted by Jason Bateman, Will Arnett and Sean Hayes, and NPR's Up First.

	











	“I just want to say that I know I am new to this game. I have great respect for this form. I have great respect for all the people that I am nominated with. I'm big fans of all of you, except for NPR, just a bunch of celebs phoning it in. Try harder,” Poehler said during her acceptance speech at the 2026 Golden Globes.


	Kelly, a former Fox News host, previously revealed that she withdrew her show from consideration for the new podcast category because she didn't like the “choose me” aspect of awards shows, and thought “the whole thing was so bizarre” and “had zero interest in their stupid awards.”


	The 2026 Golden Globes, hosted by Nikki Glaser, were held at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on Sunday evening. Find the full list of winners here, and check out the night's red carpet looks.

HBO, a latecomer to the biggest territories in the Europe, is doing cooperation and bundling deals across Europe in a bid to quickly scale its streaming service.


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


HBO Max staked its claim on a big chunk of Europe on Tuesday, launching in both Germany and Italy, two of Europe's biggest territories, as well as handful of smaller countries, including Austria, Switzerland, Greece, Israel, Luxembourg and Liechtenstein.


	Ahead of the rollout, HBO signed multiyear carriage deals with Amazon's Prime Video deal that will see the premium service added as an add-on subscription to Prime Video customers in Italy, Germany and Austria. HBO Max also extended their existing European Prime Video deals in France, Spain, the Netherlands, Sweden and Belgium.

	“2026 is a huge year for HBO Max as we launch in some of the world's biggest economies,” said Qaisar Rafique, executive vp, head of commercial development, EMEA & APAC, Warner Bros. Discovery. “Prime Video's vast reach will help us entertain as many people as possible in these new markets.”

	Added Elisabetta Carruba, director, Prime Video Channels, EMEA: “HBO is synonymous with top-quality programming; the addition of HBO Max as an add-on subscription to our existing catalog of world-class series, blockbuster movies and live sport is an important step in our aim of becoming the first stop entertainment destination for our customers.”


	HBO is a latecomer to the streaming game in much of Europe. Long-running deals with pay-TV group Sky prevented it from launching in Germany, Italy and the U.K. until this year. The carriage deals with Prime, and bundling arrangements with local platforms, including RTL+ and Waipu TV in Germany, TimVision in Italy, Sunrise and Swisscom in Switzerland, Hot and Yes in Israel and Vodafone in Greece, should help HBO scale more quickly and make up for lost time. In an increasingly competitive streaming market, platforms are seeing the benefits of aggregation, creating cooperative business models that look a lot like old school cable bundling.

	











	The company will complete its European land grab when it launches across the U.K. and Ireland in March.


	HBO is celebrating off its new European operations with a major blowout party in Berlin Tuesday night to celebrate the world premiere of A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, a new Game of Thrones prequel series that bows of the service Jan. 19. HBO has flown in the series leads, including Peter Claffey, Dexter Sol Ansell, Sam Spruell, Daniel Ings, Finn Bennett, Shaun Thomas, Bertie Carvel and Tanzyn Crawford, for the celebration, and even the big boss, Casey Bloys, chairman and CEO, HBO and Max Content, will be in town to oversee the extension of the empire.


	Alongside The Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, HBO Max is hoping to draw in European viewers with highlights including Noah Wyle's Emmy Award-winning The Pitt, steamy Canadian hockey romance drama Heated Rivalry, Paul Thomas Anderson's Golden Globe champ (and Oscar frontrunner) One Battle After Another, which will makes its streaming debut Tuesday, and library favorites include Friends, The Big Bang Theory, and the Harry Potter movies. A sports add-on will give viewers access to live events including the 2026 Olympic Winter Games, and the French and Australian Opens.


	Local-language originals will also be part of the slate, with new German series 4 Blocks Zero, a prequel to the hit Berlin gangster drama 4 Blocks and heist drama Banksters, and from Italy, Marco Bellocchio's Portobello, and docuseries including Gina Lollobrigida: Diva Contesa and Saman.

	











	Local films like Warner Bros. Pictures Germany's Wunderschöner and Italian features Nonostante and Squali, the latter starring James Franco, will be available on HBO Max in 2026.

The Bangtan Boys are back!


													By
												

	Anna Chan



	Permission to dance, because BTS is back! The K-pop supergroup announced on Tuesday (Jan. 13) that it is hitting the road in 2026-2027 for a world tour.


	The global trek is set to kick off April 9 in Goyang, South Korea, then makes a stop in Tokyo before arriving in the United States in late April. The first stateside concerts will take place April 25-26 in Tampa, Fla., and closes its North American run with four shows in Los Angeles in September.

	











	According to the press release, the tour is set to make landfall in 34 regions of the world and will include 79 concerts. Beyond South Korea, Japan and North America, the septet of Jin, RM, Jimin, V, J-Hope, Suga and Jung Kook will hit Mexico, Spain, the United Kingdom, Colombia, Brazil, Malaysia and more. The 2027 shows are currently set to take place in Australia, Hong Kong and the Philippines.


	The tour news comes shortly after BTS announced on Jan. 4 that its as yet untitled fifth album will be arriving March 20, and will include 14 tracks. The group's new album is “driven by each member's honest introspection as they collectively shaped its direction by weaving their individual perspectives into the music,” that press release noted.


	Prior to the news of the upcoming album and tour, Jung Kook teased the timeline of BTS return after the group took a hiatus so members could fulfill their mandatory military duties and focus on solo projects. “I think this spring will be more important than ever,” he told Elle Korea in December. “So I sincerely hope you all have a safe and enjoyable spring.”

Executive Editor, Television


EXCLUSIVE: The complicated life and sporting career of tennis legend Andre Agassi is set to be explored in a multi-part docuseries for Apple.


Chris Smith, who has directed documentaries including Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond, Wham! and Devo, is to direct after the streamer greenlit the series.


	It emerged last year that Apple was in talks to make an Agassi project and Smith's Library Films, which produced Netflix's Tiger King docuseries, will now produce the project.


	Justin Gimelstob, a former tennis pro and friend of Agassi's, who played against him a number of times on the world tour, will exec produce the project alongside Stacy Smith, who has worked on HBO's 100 Foot Wave and Netflix's Mr. McMahon.












	Agassi is widely considered one of the greatest tennis player of his generation; he is one of only eight men to complete a Career Grand Slam – winning all four major titles over the course of their career – and one of only three men to complete a Career Golden Slam – winning all four major titles and an Olympic gold medal. He won 60 ATP Tour-level singles titles including eight majors. The teenage phenom broke through when he won Wimbledon in 1992.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Agassi's book Open, which was written with J.R. Moehringer and published in 2009, is also one of the greatest sports memoirs. In it, he revealed details about his challenging childhood with his father Mike pushing him hard at an early age, before he was sent to Nick Bollettieri's Tennis Academy in Florida at the age of 13.


	The stone-washed denim clad star, who also wore Hot Lava bicycle shorts, revealed that he actually hated tennis as a result of his grueling childhood and his infamous long hair was actually a hairpiece that disintegrated in the shower before the final of the French Open.


	After his early success, his career stalled in the mid-‘90s with Agassi revealing in the book that he used crystal meth during this time period, which also coincided with the end of his marriage to Hollywood star Brooke Shields.

	











	However, his career rebounded in the late-‘90s when he came back from two sets down to beat Andrei Medvedev in the French Open final, completing the slam, and he went on to win another U.S. Open. He retired in 2006 at the Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York and received a long standing ovation.


	This came after his second marriage, to former tennis star Steffi Graf, with whom he has two children.


	The docuseries is the latest Agassi-related tennis project for television. Last year, Deadline reported that are developing scripted series Rally at Amazon with Julie Plec attached to serve as showrunner. The series, which is set at a hyper-competitive elite tennis academy, comes from Universal Television and Entertainment360.


	CAA Media Finance brokered the deal for the docuseries.

Sky has greenlit the long-gestating Girl with the Dragon Tattoo TV series from Behind Her Eyes duo Steve Lightfoot and Angela LaManna and The Crown producer Left Bank. 


	The big-budget adaptation comes 15 years after the movie starring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, which, as with the new TV show, came from Sony Pictures Entertainment. Three  movies were made from the Stieg Larsson trilogy, finishing in 2018. A Swedish version was also made in the noughties with Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace. 


	Casting has not yet been set for the TV version, which is described as a “bold and contemporary reimagining” and is currently being shopped to the U.S.

	The neo-noir book tells the story of lead Mikael Blomkvist's investigation to find out what happened to a girl from a wealthy family who had disappeared 40 years earlier. He recruits the help of Lisbeth Salander, a computer hacker. The movies did big business for Sony and the TV version has been in the ether for a long while.

	Sky has been tapping into big IP recently, airing a popular adaptation of The Day of the Jackal with Peacock. That show has just been recommissioned for a second season. 


	Lightfoot (The Punisher, Behind Her Eyes, Spider-Noir) and LaManna (The Haunting Of Bly Manor, Behind Her Eyes) will write and executive produce the series. Executive producers also include Andy Harries, Charlotte Moore and John Phillips for Left Bank Pictures, and Sam Hoyle for Sky.


	The series will be available on Sky in the UK, Ireland, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria. Sony Pictures Television will handle international distribution with pre-sale efforts already underway in the United States.

					By Jake Kanter 

International Investigations Editor


EXCLUSIVE: YouTube has continued to upend the natural order of UK television by overtaking the BBC on a key measurement of audience reach, according to an analysis by Deadline.


	In an unprecedented moment, YouTube passed the BBC in monthly audience reach figures published by Barb, the UK's official ratings body. The Google-owned video platform began being measured by Barb in the final three months of 2025, and in each of those months, its reach was higher than that of all BBC television channels combined.


	It is a nuanced picture, however, and Barb's figures offer just one measure of reach. On others, the BBC remains comfortably ahead of YouTube, but for the broadcaster to be supplanted on even a single metric is notable, given its decades-long dominance in Britain.

	Barb's figures, published on its website, showed that YouTube had a reach of 51.9M viewers in December, more than a million ahead of the BBC's equivalent figure of 50.8M. Barb's audience reach figure measures the number of people who watched a television service for at least three consecutive minutes in a month across TV sets, smartphones, tablets, and personal computers.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The last time the BBC's three-minute monthly reach was higher than what YouTube achieved at the backend of last year was in December 2024, when hits including Gavin & Stacey: The Finale lifted the corporation's audience to 52.7M. The table below shows how YouTube is comfortably ahead of other major services, including ITV and Netflix.

	











	“These figures show the relentless rise of YouTube, and I should think it's the first time [the BBC has been overtaken],” said Stephen Price, one of the UK's most highly-regarded experts on TV viewing habits. 


	YouTube's growth has been propelled by viewers accessing the platform on internet-connected televisions, putting it in direct competition with the traditional networks and premium streamers. Content creators, such as the Sidemen and Mr Beast, are increasingly making high-end videos that can compete with TV. The trend was a major talking point of 2025, with network executives and lawmakers attempting to wrestle with YouTube's significant influence.


	In a keynote speech at the Royal Television Society's Cambridge Convention last September, culture secretary Lisa Nandy said the government is prepared to change legislation to ensure that YouTube carries public service content prominently. YouTube said this would be “premature” at a time when it is talking to public service broadcasters about potential partnerships.


	The BBC, meanwhile, pointed to other viewing figures showing that it remains top dog. The corporation prefers a 15-minute measure of audience reach, as opposed to the three-minute data published by Barb. The BBC's average 15-minute reach was 47M last year, compared with 40.8M for YouTube, per figures supplied by the corporation. 


	The BBC's position is that three-minute figures give too much weight to short-form content, with its preferred measure better reflecting how traditional TV content is consumed. Furthermore, when you isolate just TV set viewing, the BBC's audience reach was 50M in December, 12.5M viewers ahead of YouTube's reach of 37.5M, according to Barb.


	A BBC spokesperson said: “The UK watches significantly more BBC TV than that of any other provider. In 2025, UK audiences watched 351M hours on the BBC each week, which is far ahead of anyone else. When we focus on reach, we look at a minimum of 15 minutes as an appropriate measure for long-form content and by that measure the BBC continues to lead the way.”


	Elsewhere, Barb's three-minute figures showed that Netflix had its best month on record in December, no doubt propelled by the final season of Stranger Things, which was released in three instalments. Netflix's reach of 47.1M viewers last month means that the streamer is now consistently ahead of ITV after overtaking the UK network in April. Netflix has steadily grown its audience since October 2022, when its reach stood at 41M.


Disney+ also had its best month on record, with series such as Bluey proving to be consistent draws on the service. Its reach of 29.2M in December was an outlier in what was a pretty flat year for Disney+.

The BBC needs get on YouTube fully in the forthcoming post DTT and satellite era.it is an obvious home, they could grant global rights using YT and provide both free ad based access and premium subscription which would have “first to see” hot property titles etc YT is going to dominate so they might as well embrace it's potential.

The BBC should have its public funds taken away and forced to survive on its own merit.

Matt Damon's wife, Luciana Barroso, didn't think he was “the cute one” in “Good Will Hunting” before they met.

Barroso told her now-husband that she had once had a crush on his co-star — and best friend — Ben Affleck, “probably a few months” into their relationship, which began in 2003.

“I met her best friend from high school, and it came out that the two of them went and saw ‘Good Will Hunting' together,” Damon, 55, recalled on the “Howard Stern Show” Monday of the 1997 film.

“Her best friend thought I was the cute one,” he confirmed. “And [Barroso] thought Ben was the cute one.”

After his partner's confession, Damon told her, “You got the wrong one.”

When Howard Stern pointed out that Barroso worked with both Damon and Affleck on “The Rip,” the latter weighed in on his pal's wife's past feelings about him.

“She's a great producer and a really good friend,” the “Gone Girl” star clarified. “And yeah, I never got that vibe from her.”

He joked, “I think something I did in real life rubbed it off. You know, in person, you're different.”

Damon agreed, quipping, “Finally, she met him and all that went away.”

Damon and Barroso have been married since 2005 and share four children — Barroso's daughter Alexia, 26, from a previous relationship, as well as Isabella, 19, Gia, 17, and Stella, 15.

Affleck, for his part, was married to Jennifer Garner from 2005 to 2018, and they welcomed Violet, 20, Seraphina, 17, and Samuel, 13.

He went on to wed Jennifer Lopez in 2022, but the duo called it quits two years later.

Amid Affleck's tumultuous love life, he has maintained his close bond with Damon and Barroso.

In September 2024, he made headlines for kissing Damon's wife's head during a Los Angeles outing — on the heels of Damon holding hands with Lopez.

Affleck was photographed third-wheeling the couple's dinner date the following summer.

Damon said on Monday that he was “there for all” of Affleck's relationship ups and downs, which “mean[t] a lot” to Affleck.

The “Tender Bar” star gushed, “That's sort of what a real friend is.”

Warner Bros. Discovery, the bell of the Hollywood ball, fired back against a “meritless lawsuit” from Paramount, which is staging a proxy fight to acquire the studio. After WBD rejected Paramount's latest offer to purchase the studio without adjusting the $30-per-share price or addressing “the numerous and obvious deficiencies of its offer,” David Ellison's company, Paramount Skydance, filed a lawsuit in Delaware under the guise of giving shareholders the opportunity to “make an informed decision” regarding the sale.

Per Deadline, Paramount's suit would “ask the court to simply direct WBD to provide disclosure about how it valued the Global Networks stub equity, how it valued the overall Netflix transaction, how the purchase price reduction for debt works in the Netflix transaction, or even what the basis is for its ‘risk adjustment' of our $30 per share all-cash offer.” The suit seeks disclosure of “basic information to enable WBD shareholders to make informed decision.” Additionally, in a letter to shareholders, Ellison announced that Paramount Skydance plans to nominate directors for the WBD board at WBD's 2026 shareholder meeting, setting the stage for a proxy fight that could create a significant problem for Netflix's purchase of the studio.

In response, WBD called the suit “meritless” and slammed the would-be buyer in a statement: “Despite six weeks and just as many press releases from Paramount Skydance, it has yet to raise the price or address the numerous and obvious deficiencies of its offer. Instead, Paramount Skydance is seeking to distract with a meritless lawsuit and attacks on a board that has delivered an unprecedented amount of shareholder value. In spite of its multiple opportunities, Paramount Skydance continues to propose a transaction that our board unanimously concluded is not superior to the merger agreement with Netflix.” Netflix won the WBD bake-off late last year, with Warner Bros. agreeing to sell its studio and streaming properties for $82.7 billion.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Scott Adams, creator of Dilbert comic strip, dies at 68","https://www.avclub.com/scott-adams-dies-68-prostate-cancer","Tue, 13 Jan 2026 16:23:48 GMT","

Scott Adams, most famous for creating the comic strip Dilbert, has died. Adams' first ex-wife, Shelly Miles, shared the news on his Real Coffee With Scott Adams livestream this morning, apparently minutes after it happened. “If you are reading this, things did not go well for me,” Miles reads from a message she says Scott wrote on January 1 before his death. “Many of my Christian friends have asked me to find Jesus before I go. I'm not a believer but I have to admit the risk-reward calculation for doing so looks so attractive to me, so here I go. I accept Jesus Christ as my lord and savior and look forward to spending an eternity with him. The part about me not being a believer should be quickly resolved if I wake up in heaven. I won't need any more convincing than that. I hope I still qualify for entry.” Adams was 68 years old. 

Adams shared his diagnosis of prostate cancer last May, saying at the time that he didn't expect to live through the summer. The cartoonist was fairly outspoken about the prognosis throughout the following months, with TMZ reporting yesterday that he had been in hospice care for weeks. 

Adams is best-known for creating Dilbert, a widely-syndicated comic strip that poked fun at 20th century American office life. The strip appeared in 1989 and, per The Hollywood Reporter, appeared in more than 2,000 newspapers and boasted an estimated readership of more than 150 million people across 65 countries and 25 languages. Inspired by Adams' previous job as an applications engineer at the Pacific Bell Company in San Ramon, California, the success of the comic strip led to several books, a video game, and an animated series which ran for two seasons on UPN from 1999 until 2000. Adams also wrote multiple non-Dilbert non-fiction books. 

Dilbert‘s newspaper run ended in 2023 after Adams called Black people “a hate group.”  The strip continued later for subscribers only on Adams' website. Those comments came after years of other controversial comments, including a widely-reported 2015 blog wherein he said being a man in America was somewhat similar to living under the rule of ISIS. The comic strip also took on some of Adams' more “men's rights activist” views in the years that followed. The writer also questioned how many people died during the Holocaust and spoke against the COVID-19 vaccine. 

Adams was married twice. He married Miles in 2006 and they divorced in 2014; Adams and Kristina Basham were married from 2020 until 2024, per THR. He had no children.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","In English for the first time, queer classic Stop!! Hibari-Kun! is more relevant than ever","https://www.avclub.com/stop-hibari-kun-review","Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:03:10 GMT","

It's hard to read the 1981 Shonen Jump romantic comedy Stop!! Hibari-Kun!, which centers on a non-op transgender teenager in student athletics, and not drag in the weight of contemporary baggage. Fast and loose gags which involve trans teens competing in sports or using the girls' locker room read differently today, when rhetoric around transgender people has reached absurd—and deadly—new lows. But these were the furthest things from Hisashi Eguchi's mind, over 40 years ago. Stop!! Hibari-kun! treats concerns like being outed as jokes, concocted by goofy antagonists who want to get one over on the main heroine. Eguchi handles their fuss over Hibari's anatomy or sexual morality as gags because, on some level, he doesn't take them seriously. As the writer and artist, he uses sequential storytelling to build jokes around a cherubic, sexually desirable young girl who doesn't understand her family's hang-ups and chooses not to internalize them. 

Stop!! Hibari-Kun! opens on Kohsaku, a teenage boy whose father drank himself to death, as his mother dies in hospice from an unspecified illness. As per her last wishes, the boy travels to Tokyo to board with Ibari Oozora, a mustachioed mob boss with a rank-and-file squad of goons in sunglasses at his beck and call. No sooner does Kohsaku arrive than he is introduced to Ibari's daughters—Suzume, Tsubame, and Tsugumi. No girl takes his interest, however, quite like Hibari—flirtatious and funny, she makes an immediate impression on the young man. When Ibari spills the beans about Hibari's birth sex in the first chapter, Kohsaku reacts with stock standard revulsion. It doesn't last long; by the fourth chapter, he's already having wet dreams about his new housemate. While his loud resistance never lets up entirely, the boy begins to entertain being attracted to Hibari. However, he'll have to get in line: Hibari is the most popular girl at school. To keep her safe—and preserve family honor—Kohsaku must stow the secret about her birth sex.

In a modern landscape, Stop!! Hibari-Kun! is refreshing for its blunt flirtations with realistic ugliness. While the core conceit is heightened, moments of Hibari defending her identity to an angry father or disgusted sibling resonate as real trans experiences; a moment in which her classmates scheme to assault her to “prove” her gender is chilling in a world after Brandon Teena. Yet an era of young adult comics pitched towards queer teenagers has approached trans identity as it pertains to teens with kid gloves and validity vaguespeak. Such depictions can feel disconnected from reality—comfortable escapism and nice “what ifs” that don't show queer characters against active, malicious bigotry. While escape is important, it doesn't arm a reader with tools to disentangle hatred because it presumes the reader is already progressive-minded. What's more, escapism doesn't allow a trans reader to find the absurdity in cruelty, therefore making it feel more serious than it would if they were able to lampoon it. The fact that Eguchi does just this, albeit imperfectly, is not only modern but still feels novel by weight of comparison.

That said, this is a manga from the early '80s. In acknowledgement, North American publisher Peow2 has included a disclaimer at the top of this volume, warning readers of dated caricatures and stereotypes within. Indeed, it's hard to bring up Hibari-Kun for a general audience and not at least mention Eguchi's questionable depictions of race. In this first volume, for instance, a student at Hibari's school has a comically elongated face, bulging lips, and a ring through his nose. It's an unfortunate and inadvertently hateful visual gag, born in a decade in which Sanrio openly marketed characters like Sambo, Hannah, and squat islander caricatures Binbinba. But while certain nomenclature and depictions may be outdated, the overall themes of Stop!! Hibari-Kun! are forward-thinking in 2026. Eguchi does not present his heroine as a problem to be solved; instead, the main tension is Kohsaku's inability to see Hibari on her own terms. 

This feels more timeless and prescient than much “coming out” YA media of the past decade, because it navigates regressive norms to arrive in transgressive territory. Kohsaku is not a well-meaning ally of the queer community—he's a lusty teenage boy with the same sexual hang-ups as every other guy in the story. Yet because of Hibari's fixation on him, he's forced to ask complicated questions about his sexuality that play out as a flirtatious rom-com. It predates the gender-bending romantic antics of Ranma 1/2, with none of the magical macguffins to cushion potentially uncomfortable questions about attraction. Here, Kohsaku must make good with the fact that he is physically attracted to a non-op AMAB peer, and much of the humor is at the expense of his loud denials.

What this forces readers to grapple with, ultimately, asks more of them than something like Ranma or the later, similarly absurd sex-change yuri series KashiMashi. The reader is taken down the same path as the main POV, as they (presumably) open their mind to the idea of these two characters hooking up. While there is something to be said for the hegemonic femininity Hibari embodies, even the suggestion that a trans woman can achieve this beauty is audacious. It flies in the face of decades of “men in dress” gags, from Looney Tunes to what feels like the whole of British comedy. Eguchi's belief in Hibari shows that while he might find her funny, he ultimately empathizes with and doesn't want to see harm befall her. 

That empathy is what grounds Stop!! Hibari-Kun! throughout its absurdity, and elevates it as a strong example of early queer representation in popular shonen. Where a lesser series would lean into making a spectacle of Hibari, Eguchi's care for his principal cast ensures that the reader isn't led towards hateful misconceptions. If anything, those willful misunderstandings— characters failing to meet Hibari on her terms—are often embodied by antagonists who want to out, humiliate, or otherwise wrong the character. The shonen structure ensures that these characters are in the wrong, as they are tropish roadblocks to overcome in the context of the larger narrative. As is the promise in romantic comedies of the era, each new trial nudges Kohsaku and Hibari closer toward a potential union.

Peow2's releases are based on Shogakukan's “Complete” editions, first released in 2010 and reissued in 2012. This is the first of three volumes, which will conclude with the proper ending Eguchi drew between 2009 and 2010 based on his original storyboards. Originally, Hibari-Kun was cut short by artist protest; fed up with Jump's weekly deadlines, Eguchi locked himself in a hotel and refused to leave, which prompted his editor-in-chief, Shigeo Nishimura, to can the series in retaliation—even with a successful anime adaptation airing! This bore out into an eventual boon for English readers, however. Reading the first book of Stop!! Hibari-Kun!, its mercifully short length comes as a gift in a landscape of manga shelves sagging with tome upon ceaseless tome of non-descript adolescent romance. For all their length and multitude, few can match the wit, heart, and forward-facing attitudes found in just this single volume's story.

But for all his comic's transgressions, it's Eguchi's crisp and stylish art—printed here in crisp, sturdy pages between a microtextured dustjacket—that steals the show. The future commercial artist demonstrates a canny spatial awareness and momentum to his panel layouts; readers are pelted with visual gags which segue into each other, set up by things like sliding doors or the crunching of snacks. Jokes and emotional beats are given proper space to breathe, as fashionable, attractive characters pose alongside absurdist stereotypes. While the plot is notable in and of itself, the art elevates it to must-have status. It's a minor tragedy that Japanese comics, as a commercial enterprise, push perfectionists like Eguchi out in favor of repetition-prone workhorses. Few artists who have gone through Jump have as keen a grasp on atmosphere and momentum as is on display in Stop!! Hibari-Kun!.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","After Show-Ending Rift, Mina Starsiak Hawk Says Things Are Improving for Her & Mom Karen E. Laine","https://entertainmentnow.com/hgtv/mina-starsiak-hawk-mom-karen-laine-update/","Tue, 13 Jan 2026 16:31:26 GMT","

Two years after a rift between HGTV's popular mother-daughter renovation team, Mina Starsiak Hawk and Karen E. Laine, ended their hit show, “Good Bones,” the two have made strides in healing their relationship off-screen. 

Noting that the deterioration of their relationship happened over a long period of time, Starsiak Hawk told People in an interview published on January 13, 2026, “It took us a lot of time to get there. So I think it takes a lot of time to kind of get out of it as well.”

In a big improvement since their show ended in the fall of 2023, the mother-daughter duo are on speaking terms again, Starsiak Hawk told People, and periodically spend time together. 

“We were all together for the holidays, so we're all amicable,” she told the outlet. “We're not like best friends that braid each other's hair on Saturday nights or anything, but no, it's good.” 

Starsiak Hawk announced in August 2023 that the eighth season of “Good Bones” would be the last. Two weeks later, she stunned fans by revealing she was estranged from her mom and brothers, who were also part of the show.

During a very emotional episode of her “Mina AF” podcast that month, she said, ““My mom and I aren't in a great place. My brother Tad and I aren't in a great place. My brother William and I are in a kind-of-like-nonexistent place. It's complicated without even being complicated.”

By that September, she told People that the drama with her mom included a “knockdown drag-out fight” while filming the first episode of the eighth season.

In the years since their rift, Starsiak Hawk and Laine have been busy. Starsiak Hawk has continued to renovate homes in Indianapolis, and has made multiple appearances on HGTV including an episode of “House Hunters: All Stars.” 

HGTV announced in October 2025 that its seventh season of “Rock the Block” will, for the first time, feature HGTV stars past and present, paired with a celebrity partner. Starsiak Hawk, who spent eight seasons starring on “Good Bones,” will return, teaming up with former NFL star and Super Bowl champion Vernon Davis. The show is expected to premiere in early 2026. 

She told People that while she was filming the show in Las Vegas, her family “came out and visited and they got to see the house and the set,” noting that they “very much missed” her being on TV.

Their visit reminded the kids of having HGTV crews around, she said, and kept asking, “‘Mom, when are you going to build houses again on TV? The cameras aren't around anymore. When are we going to do that again?'”

Laine, meanwhile, split from her fourth husband and sold the North Carolina property where she had planned to retire after restoring it for a 2024 “Good Bones” spinoff (on which she and Starsiak Hawk appeared separately, with updates on their lives). In May 2025, Laine — who worked as a lawyer before “Good Bones” — announced that she had joined the Indianapolis law firm of criminal defense attorney Josiah Swinney.

I am wishing Mina good luck in all her endeavors, she is a strong person and a fighter, go for it you are talented and very special.

Look forward to seeing you, Mina.

As far as mom's concerned,  been there, done that…twice.
Good luck!

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘The Good Old Days' Star Passes Away at 94: Co-Stars Share Kind Words","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/sheila-bernette-bbc-good-old-days-tributes/","Tue, 13 Jan 2026 10:34:14 GMT","

Beloved Singer and actress Sheila Bernette has died at the age of 94, a close friend has confirmed, as reported by The Daily Mail. Bernette enjoyed a long and varied career in British entertainment, becoming best known for her many appearances on the BBC's beloved music hall series “The Good Old Days.”

Born Sheila Poncini in London on March 30, 1931, Bernette grew up in a family of Italian descent. For decades, she appeared on television, in film, and in live performance, bringing warmth, humor, and a natural stage presence to her work. She appeared regularly on “The Good Old Days” from 1968 to 1983, bringing Victorian and Edwardian-style songs and sketches to life for a new generation of viewers.

Actor Peter Kosta announced Bernette's passing on Monday, January 12, calling her a cherished friend who brought “just fun and laughter” into his life.

According to the Manchester Evening News, Kosta, 77, first met Bernette while working in the theatre with Sir David Jason, the actor known for his role in “Only Fools and Horses.“

Kosta shared a personal story with the Press Association, recalling how he had been looking for a place to stay, and she offered him a spare room in her home, saying, “Well, if you're clean, I have a spare room in my house.”

He spoke highly of her loyalty and support throughout his career, mentioning that she always encouraged him and attended his events whenever she could.

“She always supported me in everything that I wanted to do, and always came to see me in everything I did, whenever she could. I have extremely fond memories of her,” he said.

Kosta also reflected on a visit he made to Bernette shortly before her death. “I saw her for nearly two hours, and we were talking about the good old days,” he shared. He described her as “very funny” and “very feisty.”

The Daily Mail reported that the Royal Variety Charity paid tribute to Bernette in a statement, honoring her lasting impact on British entertainment. “Sheila will be very much missed by many of those who worked with her and those from the wider theatrical family,” the charity said.

Bernette also appeared in the 1961 romance film “Ticket To Paradise” as Clarice, and later in the 1971 comedy anthology “The Magnificent Seven Deadly Sins” as Mrs. Spencer.

Her television credits included appearances alongside comedy legends such as Dick Emery, Leslie Crowther, and Morecambe and Wise. She was also among the original practical jokers on the UK version of “Candid Camera.”

In 1970, Bernette took part in the Royal Variety Performance, where Crowther introduced her as Russian defector ballerina Natalia Nokemova performing “The Dance Of The Sugar Plum Fairy.” 

She also worked as a singer on the BBC's “The Black And White Minstrel Show” from 1967 to 1969.

Later generations may remember her as Mrs Poshington, the hotel guest who never leaves, on the CBBC sitcom “Hotel Trubble,” where she appeared from 2008 to 2011.

Bernette also made appearances in “Coronation Street,” “The Morecambe And Wise Show,” “The Dick Emery Show,” “The Fall And Rise Of Reginald Perrin,” “Cooper,” “Just Like That,” starring Tommy Cooper, and “The Little and Large Show.”

Her later film roles included “Three For All,” “Car Trouble,” and “Driving Aphrodite,” released in 2009, which marked her final film appearance. 

She sounds like she was a wonderful woman and actress. I am sorry that I never had the honor of seeing any of her performances. More so,  sorry to hear of her passing.  May she Rest in Peace. 

Respectfully,
Mrs.  Jane McMillin
1-12-2026

RIP Shelia🙏 her summer season in Paignton with Leslie Crowther moons ago was fun. We stayed in touch over the years. Last time we had fish and chips at The Golden Hind, Marylebone.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘Idol' Judges Reveal the Fascinating Must-Haves Inside Their Backpacks","https://entertainmentnow.com/american-idol/judges-backpacks-promo-season-24/","Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:13:38 GMT","

As ABC gears up for season 24 of “American Idol,” judges Luke Bryan, Carrie Underwood, and Lionel Richie have filmed some playful social media promos tying into the 2026 theme of “Idol University.” Many of the auditions and a new version of Hollywood Week filmed at Belmont University in Nashville. 

In social media posts starting on January 10, all three judges emptied their “backpacks” to reveal the must-haves they need to have with them each day. The items they pulled out were actually pretty fascinating, giving fans a fun peek inside their lives. 

Dubbed by the “Idol” crew as the “snack queen,” Underwood did have many snacks tucked inside her backpack including bars, celery sticks, carrots, and cherry tomatoes — likely all grown on her Nashville farm. She started with a small container filled with mints, though, explaining, “Don't want to scare away Luke and Lionel!” 

The season 3 “Idol” winner-turned-judge then pulled out a bag of crochet tools, noting that “that's what I do when I'm in the hair and makeup chair.” 

Underwood also said she always has a notebook and pen handy to “write down my thoughts on different contestants” and “maybe some song ideas for myself — I don't know, inspiration is everywhere.”

When Bryan dumped out his backpack, he quipped, “Pretty much my life right there.” His items were decidedly different than Underwood's. 

Among his belongings, he had a bag of golf balls, revealing that golfing is his “new favorite thing.” But it hasn't replaced his other favorite hobby, fishing, as evidenced by the bass fishing lures and plastic worms in his backpack. In addition, he had his guitar strap, tuner, and foot pedal for jam sessions. 

Bryan also pulled out a Ziploc bag full of popcorn, which he declared is his “favorite snack,” and — unsurprisingly — a can of beer. 

Richie's backpack contents were a bit less revealing. He pulled out a pair of shades for “the coolness,” and then a bunch of music-making tools including a portable keyboard, an “old-school metronome” for keeping rhythm, and a water bottle, declaring, “You've got to be hydrated!” 

And, of course, Richie had a copy of his own memoir, “Truly,” in his backpack. All three judges plus host Ryan Seacrest will be reporting for a new season of “American Idol” on January 26 at 8 p.m. Eastern time.

Hudson Square's beloved Film Forum is bringing more than 50 classics set in New York City to its screens starting February 6 through February 26.

“Tenement Stories: From Immigrants to Bohemians,” per Film Forum, illuminates “over a century of New York City history as captured on screen in tenement homes and working-class neighborhoods, giving voice to the immigrants, migrants, refugee families, and bohemians whose lives and labors shaped the city.”

IndieWire shares the fresh trailer for the series exclusively below.

The series includes iconic New York movies — as well as ones ready for a new spotlight — by Martin Scorsese, King Vidor, Charles Chaplin, Francis Ford Coppola, Lois Weber, Elia Kazan, Sergio Leone, Shirley Clarke, John Huston, Buster Keaton, D.W. Griffith, William Wyler, Leon Ichaso, Robert Wise, Raoul Walsh, Jules Dassin, Preston Sturges, Joan Micklin Silver, Sean Baker, and many more.

Annie Polland of the Tenement Museum will be among the special guests of the series, and as she said in a statement to Film Forum, “The Film Forum series shows these real life dramas through film, letting you time travel through the tenements, from the Yiddish-speaking sweatshop in ‘Uncle Moses' to a young Irish American girl's awakening in ‘A Tree Grows in Brooklyn' to Martin Scorsese's portrait of his parents in ‘Italianamerican' to more recent tenement life, as seen through the eyes of Latino, Chinese, Iranian, and other New Yorkers.”

Guests will also include Cathy Scorsese, Martin's daughter and the granddaughter of his immigrant parents; Peter McCrea, son of Joel McCrea, star of William Wyler's “Dead End”; and more.

Bruce Goldstein, Film Forum's repertory artistic director, said, “In the silent and early talkie eras, Hollywood churned out cinematic fantasies about the super-rich, but there were also many movies set in New York's so-called tenement districts, particularly the Lower East Side of Manhattan, once the most densely populated place on earth. That and other neighborhoods, like Harlem, East Harlem and parts of Brooklyn and the Bronx, also had an avid moviegoing population — in the 1930s and '40s, the Lower East Side alone had over 30 movie theaters, from fleapits to palaces — so people were seeing versions of their own lives reflected onscreen. The same neighborhoods would show up in later movies, but with New York's changing population represented.”

Watch the trailer for the film series below ahead of its February 6 launch date.

Take a gander at this year's assorted jury members for the Sundance Film Festival, and their deep connections to the fest should be clear. 

The 17-member jury cohort includes an unusually (and purposely!) high number of filmmaker alumni, including names like A.V. Rockwell, Janicza Bravo, Bao Nguyen, Azazel Jacobs, Jennie Livingston, Nisha Ganatra, So Yong Kim, and many more. A further treat for real Sundance fans: beloved festival and programming alumni John Cooper and Trevor Groth, who will return to Park City, Utah, to judge the forward-thinking NEXT section.

 










The group “is composed of influential voices across film, art, and culture, united by a deep commitment to artist-driven storytelling and informed by decades of creating, championing, and engaging with independent work.” The jury will select the winners, who will be announced during the Awards Ceremony at The Ray Theatre on Friday, January 30.

“Planning this special year, it felt especially meaningful to invite a slate of jurors who have a rich history with the Festival, all deeply rooted in the creative community they will now help champion,” said Kim Yutani, the Festival's director of programming, in an official statement. “It's a full-circle way to honor many of the artists, partners, and industry members who have played such a pivotal role in shaping the Sundance Film Festival's legacy for more than 40 years.”

 










Also announced today: the jury for the Alfred P. Sloan Feature Film Prize, which deliberated ahead of the Festival and includes Sophie Barthes, Dr. Heather Berlin, Dr. Andrea Ghez, Ari Handel, and Nicole Perlman. The jury has awarded the prize to “In the Blink of a Eye” director Andrew Stanton and screenwriter Colby Day. The jury, which includes both film and science professionals, presents the award to an outstanding feature film focusing on science or technology as a theme or depicting a scientist, engineer, or mathematician as a major character. In-person audiences will participate in selecting the 2026 Audience Awards, which are available to films in the U.S. Competition, World Competition, and NEXT. Attendees will also have the opportunity to vote for the Festival Favorite, chosen from all in-person eligible feature film screenings. 

The festival will be held from January 22 through February 1, 2026, in person in Park City and Salt Lake City, Utah, with the at-home program available online from January 29 through February 1, 2026, for audiences across the country.

As Eugene Hernandez, director of the Sundance Film Festival and Public Programming, noted in his own statement: “This year's jury represents a rare depth of creative conviction and exceptional range, made up of artists and thinkers who know what it means to take risks,” “They bring curiosity, rigor, and a deep respect for bold storytelling, qualities that are essential to discovering the films that will define the future of independent cinema.” U.S. DRAMATIC COMPETITION JURY Janicza Bravo is a writer and director mostly but sometimes an actor.

Genre:

Folk/Country

Reviewed:

January 13, 2026

Like most writers who can't bring themselves to lay down their pen, Zach Bryan prefers creating to editing. Songs spill out of him, as do recordings. Only three days after delivering With Heaven on Top, the fourth album he's issued through Warner, he released an acoustic version of the same set of 25 songs, adding it on top of the original so the album now runs over two hours and 20 minutes, a length that stays true to his tradition of overabundance.

Bryan tetchily explained his decision on an Instagram post: “I'm assuming this record is just like all the other ones and there's gonna be a billion people saying it's overproduced and shitty so I sat down in a room by myself and recorded all the songs acoustically so I didn't have to hear everyone whine about more stuff.” The defensiveness disguises the admission that With Heaven on Top does indeed boast a robust production, one teeming with horns and backing vocals, all set to a big beat designed to echo throughout the stadiums Bryan now headlines. Considering the magnitude of these venues—this past September, he inaugurated Ann Arbor's Michigan Stadium with the largest-ever ticketed show in American history—it was perhaps inevitable that he'd start to make records that also sounded huge and vast.

Save “Slicked Back,” where he stumbles backward into a pop song catchy enough to be a crossover hit, the path Bryan takes on With Heaven on Top is too winding and circuitous to lead him directly toward the mainstream. The additional instrumentation accentuates the mood as much as adding muscle. Horns drunkenly lumber into the spotlight, electric guitars echo in the distance, backing vocalists offer texture as much as supporting harmonies. Sometimes, the auxiliary players seem to have wandered in from another session: The horns and strings struggle to find a steady footing on “Anyways” and accentuate off-kilter, secondary emotions on “Always Willin'.”

As odd as their arrangements can be, Bryan's songs benefit from a robust, considered production. The extra musicians lend a bittersweet undercurrent to “South and Pine” and punch up the surging chorus of “Appetite.” Even the simpler songs sound fuller. Witness the single “Plastic Cigarette,” which uses empty space to create a supple warmth. It's a new wrinkle for Zach Bryan: He's using the music to suggest a feeling he can't put into words.

Words usually don't fail him. This is a guy who habitually opens his records with a piece of spoken poetry. Fittingly, his songs often play like short stories, sketches, and vignettes. Their intimacy may be why Bryan feels compelled to present them in an unadorned form on the acoustic release, but the stark setting emphasizes sincerity at the price of understanding. Stripped of anything other than his acoustic guitar, Bryan mumbles and murmurs, drawing no distinction between heartbreak and new love, singing about how “ICE is gonna come bust down your door” on “Bad News” without a trace of a snarl, softening his lament for the “fading of the red, white, and blue.”

On the studio version of “Bad News,” With Heaven on Top, Bryan's voice cracks as he sings of the “cocky motherfuckers,” his pent-up anger accentuated by an ominous drumroll and impressionistic smears of horns. A similar scenario plays out on “Skin,” a song where a bad breakup drives him to take a blade to an old tattoo. Alone with his acoustic, Bryan smothers the hurt, but when he's playing with a full band, he seems to be working through the pain, hoping to arrive at the other side. The same sentiment could be applied to With Heaven on Top: It's the sound of Zach Bryan figuring out how to paint on a larger canvas, how to sound like the superstar he has become.

Sunn O))) are ready for their big debut on Sub Pop. After revealing last fall that they signed to the legendary Seattle label, the drone-metal band has announced a new self-titled album and a tour of North America. Sunn O))) is out April 3. Check out their new song “Glory Black” and their full list of tour dates below.

The forthcoming LP is Sunn O)))'s first in seven years, following their 2019 double punch with Life Metal and Pyroclasts. Drone stewards Stephen O'Malley and Greg Anderson co-produced the album with Brad Wood. “Glory Black,” which closes out Sunn O))), is the first preview of the LP. However, the duo did drop three new songs just a few months ago—“Eternity's Pillars,” “Raise the Chalice,” and “Reverential”—that were packed together on a 12"" single.

When they head out on tour this spring, Sunn O))) will be headlining a run across North America. The first leg begins on April 1 in Phoenix, Arizona, and ends on April 19 in Omaha, Nebraska. Additional concerts will be announced soon, a press release promises. Tickets for Sunn O)))'s tour go on sale this Friday at 10 a.m. local time.

“I wrote this to make my girlfriend want to give me a kiss,” Anjimile said in a press statement. “We live about an hour apart, and I was just by myself thinking about her. Thinking about wanting a kiss. What could I do to get a kiss from my sweetheart? Write a song about it! Anyway, it worked.”

The King came out in 2023. Last year, Anjimile shared the one-off single “Auld Lang Syne II,” also produced by Cook.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pitchfork.com","José González Returns With New Album and Tour","https://pitchfork.com/news/jose-gonzalez-returns-with-new-album-and-tour/","Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:45:07 GMT","

José González is preparing his first album in four years. Against the Dying of the Light, the follow-up to Local Valley, is out March 27 via Mute. Below, watch Fredrik Egerstrand's video for the title track and check out González's tour dates behind the LP. The album tracklist, also below, includes the recent single “Pajarito.”

The Swedish singer-songwriter gives a typically big-picture assessment of the song in a press release:

“Against the Dying of the Light” is a song reflecting on humanity in 2025. It's about accepting who we are and what led us here, since the past can't be changed…. Even though natural selection led us here, we don't have to do what is in the gene's best interest. And even though cultural evolution led to our societies, we don't have to keep all the narratives if they drag us down. And even though we have enormous opportunities with new technology that can eventually design and copy itself, we don't have to build it right away if it has the potential to make us obsolete. We can rebel against these replicators, rebel against the dying of the light.

The album, he adds, concerns “who we are—tribes of sentient apes with stories that sometimes are incompatible with each other and tools that could eventually lead to dystopia or extinction.” He goes on to lament the scourge of dogmatic ideology, spouted by “dudes who pretend to know shit they don't.” And while the record “can be listened to just for the sounds, harmonies, and rhythms,” the lyrics, he insists, are “meant to inspire people to engage and take action by collaborating to solve collective problems. For humanism and enlightenment values and against the dying of the light.”

	2026 is the year of BTS. The supergroup will mark its live return with an extensive tour launching this April and running through March 2027, with additional dates to be announced. The trek arrives in support of their upcoming musical return, scheduled to arrive on March 20 as part of their comeback following an extended hiatus.


	The BTS world tour will kick off in Goyang, South Korea, on April 9. The band will spend multiple nights in each city on the trek, which includes stops in Tokyo, Mexico City, Las Vegas, Busan, London, Paris, Chicago, Toronto, East Rutherford, Buenos Aires, Sydney, Bangkok, Hong Kong, and Manila. Specific venues for each city have not been announced, though the routing suggests the band will be booking stadiums.


	ARMY Membership holders will have access to tickets beginning Jan. 22 and 23 local time. A general sale will follow on Jan. 24 across all regions. 


	BTS have been in the studio working on new music since July, promising an album that will “reflect each member's thoughts and ideas.” At the beginning of the year, RM shared, “We've waited more earnestly than anyone else,” with Jimin adding, “The year we've been waiting for has finally arrived.” V teased, “In 2026, we'll make even more good memories, so look forward to it!”

	











	Fans have been anticipating the album and accompanying live show since last year. “We're approaching the album with the same mindset we had when we first started,” BTS shared in July. “We're also planning a world tour alongside the new album. We'll be visiting fans all around the world, so we hope you're as excited as we are.”

	











	The members of BTS had a chance to sharpen their skills even during their time away from the group. Outside of completing their mandatory military service requirements, V, Suga, Jin, Jungkook, RM, Jimin, and J-Hope also pursued solo endeavors as musicians. Suga, Jin, and J-Hope also headlined respective solo tours. “I sought advice from him on the overall structure of the tour,” J-Hope told Rolling Stone last year about discussing solo touring with Suga. “As for the performances, we each bring a unique set of strengths to the stage, so I focused on shaping the production to reflect what I wanted to explore in various ways.” Now, they're bringing their lessons back to the band.

	Scott Adams, creator of the long-running comic strip Dilbert who courted controversy as a late-career political and social commentator, died today after a battle with cancer. Adams' ex-wife, Shelly, confirmed his death in a video message. He was 68.


	Shelly Adams relayed a message Scott wrote to his fans earlier this month. “For the first part of my life, I was focused on making myself a worthy husband and parent, as a way to find meaning,” Scott wrote. “That worked, but marriages don't always last forever and mine eventually ended in a highly amicable way. I'm grateful for those years and for the people I came to call my family.” 


	He went on to write that he needed a “new focus”: “I looked for ways I could add the most to people‘s lives.” He discussed the success of his 2014 book, How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big. “I still hear every day how much the book changed lives,” he wrote. “My plan to be useful was working.” 

	











	Via Shelly, Adams wrote of his podcast Real Coffee With Scott Adams and concluded his message by looking back on his life. “I didn't plan it this way,” he wrote, “but [the podcast] ended up helping lots of lonely people find a community that made them less lonely. Again, that had great meaning to me. 


	“I had an amazing life,” Adams added. “I gave it everything I had. If I got any benefits for my work, I'm asking that you pay it forward as best as you can. That's the legacy I want: Be useful and please know I loved you all to the very end.”

	











	Adams revealed on his podcast last May that he'd been diagnosed with prostate cancer, and the disease had already spread throughout his body. Adams admitted that his prognosis was not good, and he spent much of the year trying various treatments. He eventually pleaded with Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and President Donald Trump to receive access to the cancer drug Pluvicto.


	“He was a fantastic guy, who liked and respected me when it wasn't fashionable to do so,” Trump wrote in a statement. “He bravely fought a long battle against a terrible disease. My condolences go out to his family, and all of his many friends and listeners.”

	While some of these treatments appeared to alleviate Adams' pain, his condition did not improve. In a message shared on Jan. 1, Adams said he'd lost all feelings in his legs and was struggling with “ongoing heart failure.” “The odds of me recovering are essentially zero,” he said. ”I'll give you an update if that changes, but it won't.” 


	Though a fan of comics and avid illustrator from his childhood, Adams began his career in the white-collar world he would end up lampooning with Dilbert. He graduated from college in 1979 with a degree in economics, and he got his first job as a bank teller in San Francisco (where he claimed he was robbed twice at gunpoint). Over the next several years, Adams took on a variety of jobs at the bank, all while drawing comics on the side, including early versions of the character that would become Dilbert. He often peppered these drawings into presentations for upper management.


	“My comics weren't funny in the ha-ha sense,” Adams wrote in the intro to a Dilbert compendium, “but they reminded people of their jobs, and that seemed to be enough.” 


	Adams eventually left the bank, pursued an MBA, and got a new job at Pacific Bell. Even as he tried to climb the corporate ladder, he continued to draw and eventually started pitching Dilbert comics to various publications. While his initial efforts proved unsuccessful, in 1988 the newspaper syndication service United Media offered him the chance to fully develop the strip.

Dilbert debuted in April 1989, and within a few years it was running in 150 newspapers. But Adams still wasn't making enough money to quit his day job. Looking for an easy way to solicit reader feedback, he made the tech-savvy (for the time) move of including his AOL email address in the strip. He quickly learned that readers didn't want to see Dilbert at home or about town, but at his office. 

	











	Just as email helped Adams fine-tune the strip's workplace theme, the emerging dot-com boom helped make Dilbert an ideal comic for the mid-Nineties. “Technology workers embraced Dilbert as one of their own,” he wrote in the compendium. “The media embraced Dilbert as a symbol of the downsizing era, which overlapped with the first part of the dot-com buildup. Dilbert became shorthand for bad management, oppressed cubicle workers, and high-tech life.” 


	By the end of 1995, Dilbert was in 800 papers, and Adams was finally able to leave his job at Pacific Bell. The following year, he published The Dilbert Principle, a business book mixed with comics, that began a New York Times bestseller. 


	The book's title came from Adams' inversion of the Peter Principle, a maxim that employees are promoted because of their successes, but eventually reach a point where they are no longer competent. The Dilbert principle — traced back to a quote in a 1995 strip — posited that managers and higher-ups are actually successful morons whose stubbornness is confused for real leadership qualities. 


	“[I]n many cases the least competent, least smart people are promoted, simply because they're the ones you don't want doing actual work,” Adams said in a 2002 interview. “You want them ordering the doughnuts and yelling at people for not doing their assignments — you know, the easy work. Your heart surgeons and your computer programmers — your smart people — aren't in management.”


	Adams would enjoy massive success in the decades to come. By the new millennium, Dilbert was syndicated in 2,000 newspapers in 57 countries, and running in 19 different languages. There were copious Dilbert books and other merchandise, desktop computer games, and an animated TV show that aired for two seasons. (A live-action Dilbert pilot was even made, but never aired, with a rare copy existing in the Library of Congress.) Adams also published several non-Dilbert books, including a pair of novels, and several memoir/self-help/pop-science texts. 


	One of these, 2017's Win Bigly: Persuasion in a World Where Facts Don't Matter, captured the themes and thinking that would come to define the final decade of Adams' life. A few years prior, Adams was one of the few people to correctly predict that Donald Trump would become president based on his powers of persuasion. 


	At the time, Adams was often critical of Trump, and in his book he described himself as an “ultraliberal”; still, as someone long-fascinated with the art and power of persuasion, he was awed by Trump's rise to power, and often wrote glowingly about it. This made Adams a favorite among Trump supporters, who backed his work amid heavy criticism on social media. Adams later said one of the reasons he wrote Win Bigly was “so many people who supported me on Twitter specifically asked me to write it,” and he called the book “a favor returned.”

	











	Over the next few years, Adams became a prominent figure in the conservative media ecosystem. While he continued to write and draw Dilbert, he also hosted the popular podcast, Real Coffee With Scott Adams, which frequently featured interviews with right-wing figures like former congressman Matt Gaetz and commentators Dave Rubin and Greg Gutfeld. 


	Adams' politics appeared to shift, too, and he soon found himself embroiled in culture war controversies, often surrounding race. In 2022, over 75 newspapers dropped Dilbert after Adams introduced the strip's first Black character, which he then used as a prop to mock “wokeness” (the character identified as white and LGBTQ+ for work purposes). 


	A year later, hundreds more papers — including the The Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, and the entire USA Today network — dropped the comic after Adams called Black Americans a “hate group” that white Americans should “get the hell away from” after a conservative organization poll claimed to show that many Black people didn't think it was OK to be white. Adams insisted his comments were “hyperbole,” while also doubling down as an ostensible cancel culture martyr.

	“Has anyone else been canceled while literally no one disagreed with them?” he wrote in one tweet at the time. “My critics don't disagree with my advice (seen in context). They are justifiably angry that it is rational. I am too.”


	Despite no longer being syndicated in newspapers, Adams continued to publish Dilbert on his website, alongside his regular Real Coffee episodes. It wasn't until November 2025 that Adams was forced to finally stop drawing Dilbert due to complications from his cancer. Still, he continued to write the script, while his art director took over the illustrations.

	Imagine if President Barack Obama — or God forbid, Bernie Sanders — decided to have the Justice Department open a criminal investigation into the chairman of the Federal Reserve.


	What if a Democratic president unilaterally jacked up tariffs and kicked off a trade war with our long-time allies — while getting pantsed in a trade war with the Chinese communist party? What's worse, imagine if they demanded select privately held companies be part-owned by the U.S. government.


	Screams of righteous outrage would echo from the steel and glass caverns of Wall Street. This would fulfill decades of stern warnings rooted in Milton Friedman shibboleths about free trade, free people, and fiscal responsibility.


	But all this gets ditched when Donald Trump does it. Instead, titans of American industry abandon long-held free market beliefs and line up to perform ornate acts of supplication to the president. Apparently, if you have an unhinged would-be autocrat in charge of the national economy and so much business is wrapped up in government spending, the right thing to do is kiss his ass in the public square and say it smells like roses, later claiming that you did it all for the shareholders. It is better for the balance sheet to be in the mad king's good graces.

	











	The counter-example is all too rare — a leader with integrity refusing to blink when faced with bullying threats from the president and his henchmen. Witness Fed Chair Jay Powell — fresh off his worst weekend ever as a Deadhead dealing with Bob Weir's death as well as a Trumped-up grand jury subpoena — stating the facts simply to camera: “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president.”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Trump's assault on the independence of the Federal Reserve is just the latest insult to the ideals of free markets. The fact that Wall Street leaders who hyperventilated on even modest moves toward a stronger social safety net like Obamacare would find ways to rationalize their support of Trump's betrayal of their alleged deepest philosophical beliefs about the economy makes you wonder if they were ever motivated by more than partisan team-ism.

	After all, the last president to deliver a surplus, Bill Clinton, was called an amoral communist by the far-right. Barack Obama was slurred as a Marxist Manchurian candidate for trying to do radical things like increase health care coverage through individual mandates. In Obama's case, it was literally a Heritage Foundation proposal first advanced by Mitt Romney as governor of Massachusetts. This got twisted into a Tea Party crusade against the government takeover of health care, complete with death panels. These right-wing jihads were often underwritten by billionaires who claimed that the sanctity of free markets was their primary motivation.


	Evidently, this is no longer the case. 


	A friend who works in the hedge fund industry once told me that the stock market could be best understood as a barometer of old rich white men's feelings. Seen through this lens, Trump can do very little that would negatively impact the markets — as his actions and the reactions of the market to date would indicate. After all, stocks rose the Monday after Trump's assault on the independence of the Fed. 


	As a counterpoint, I'd trot out the late Berkshire Hathaway chair Charlie Munger's wisdom that in the short run, the stock market is a voting machine; in the long run, it's a weighing machine. By this logic, Trump's efforts to turn the U.S. economy into a low-tax, high-tariff regime with a side-hustle government-run shakedown operation — in which foreign policy is conducted for business and the U.S. government owns a stake in those businesses — will end badly for everyone involved.

	That's because in the long run, the weighing machine will matter — just as in the long run, deficits and debts do matter, even if we should all now understand that Republicans only give a damn about deficits and debt when a Democrat is president.

	The ultimate danger Trump is teeing up is a lack of trust in the United States and corresponding increased effort toward replacing the U.S. dollar as the world reserve currency, which would spark an overnight economic apocalypse here at home.

	











	But for now, the music keeps playing and Wall Street keeps dancing while the impartial rule of law in America burns. We are well into the danger zone that self-styled constitutional conservatives warned about for decades in screeds about crony capitalism — but because the actions are coming from a Republican president who rules by fear and greed, most of them are silent. This silence is complicity. Democracy depends on the character of its citizens and leaders. When the crash comes, it will once again be Main Street who gets hurt more than Wall Street, and Republicans will try to pull the patented Trump arsonist-as-a-firefighter routine and hope that Americans will be too angry, divided and distracted to remember who lit the fire and ignored its spread in the first place.

	Four days after Timothy Busfield was accused of child sex abuse, the Albuquerque Police Department asked the U.S. Marshals Service for help in locating the West Wing actor. 


	“We are working with the U.S. Marshals Service to get Mr. Busfield into custody. That is simply because we believe he is outside the state of New Mexico,” a spokesperson for the police department tells Rolling Stone.


	A New Mexico judge signed off on a 13-page arrest warrant for Busfield on Friday. The 68-year-old is charged with two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and one count of child abuse related to twin child actors he worked with on the Fox television series The Cleaning Lady. (Rolling Stone has contacted a representative for Busfield for comment.)


	An investigation into the Emmy Award-winning actor and director was launched in November 2024, when police were called to the University of New Mexico Hospital over concern that two young boys were possibly “groomed” by Busfield. The boys referred to Busfield, who served as executive producer and a director for the show, as “Uncle Tim” and described unwanted tickling. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The incidents allegedly began occurring when the children, identified only by their initials in the arrest warrant, were around seven years old. At the time, neither child disclosed any sexual contact, and no further action was taken. 


	But by October 2025, the boys' mother called Child Protective Services, stating “her children both disclosed that there was sexual abuse by Timothy from around November 2022 to spring 2024,” according to the arrest warrant obtained by Rolling Stone.

	











	Officials subsequently obtained therapist records where one of the boys disclosed “that a director of a series … had engaged in inappropriate touching.” Diagnosed with PTSD and anxiety, the child was so distraught that he was having “nightmares about the director touching him and waking up scared,” according to the warrant. 


	In interviews with officials, one of the boys claimed Busfield had repeatedly touched his private areas over his clothes while filming the show. The boy said he “was afraid to tell anyone because Tim was the director, and he feared Tim would get mad at him.”

	Investigators noted they interviewed Busfield and his wife, Little House on the Prairie star Melissa Gilbert, over speakerphone in November. Busfield acknowledged there was a “playful environment” on set and that parent company Warner Bros. investigated a similar complaint against him, but the claims couldn't be substantiated. 


	Busfield told officials the accusations were “revenge” for The Cleaning Lady replacing the child actors with a younger actor in the series. “There would never be a weird moment about it. I don't really remember picking those boys up,” Busfield told investigators, according to the warrant. “I remember picking up the boy who followed them. I'd pick him up, and he'd be giggling, and that would sort of get him ready to act.”


	After conducting several interviews with members of the production crew, the detective submitted his findings, writing “in my training and experience, pedophiles often infiltrate families under a trusted role, like Timothy, who, as a producer, exploited the hectic film sets to tickle and touch [the child actor] on his penis and buttocks, masking it as play,” according to the arrest warrant. 


	“He would invite the family to off-set gatherings, with his wife buying Christmas gifts to foster closeness, making [the child] feel special and dependent — classic grooming to erode boundaries, isolate the victim, and silence suspicions by blending abuse into normalcy,” the detective continued in his report. “This dual tactic, charming parents while secretly violating the child, builds a web of complicity that is hard to unravel, delaying detection, as families trust the abuser's facade.”

	Busfield has appeared in several films, including Revenge of the Nerds, Field of Dreams, and Little Big League. He has won an Emmy for his role on the drama series Thirtysomething. 

	











	Shortly before Busfield was accused of misconduct, his wife posted about inappropriate age-gap relationships in Hollywood, referring to her time on Little House on the Prairie when she was 15, and her character was “expected to ‘fall in love with' and kiss a man on film who was several years older than she was.”

	“Through the lens of today, this is shocking. I have no words other than to say, ‘I WAS A CHILD.' ‘I WAS FIFTEEN.' And I was the good news,” Gilbert wrote. “Thank God my mom and Michael [Landon Sr.] and so many others were there to make sure I was safe. Can you imagine if I hadn't had them all? I am so fortunate (Sort of). Many other young women aren't.” Gilbert has since deactivated her Instagram account.

	The crackdowns on “wokeness” and “liberal indoctrination” in American higher education reached a ridiculous new low last week when a philosophy professor revealed that Texas A&M University objected to him including one of history's most revered minds on a course syllabus. The forbidden readings came from Plato, the Athenian philosopher whose work is widely regarded as an important basis for Western thought over more than two millennia. 


	This puzzling decision stems from an earlier controversy. Last fall, A&M fired Melissa McCoul, a lecturer in the English department, for acknowledging differences between gender identity and expression in a summer semester course on children's literature. A student had filmed herself confronting McCoul over the material, telling her, “I'm not entirely sure this is legal to be teaching,” citing Donald Trump‘s executive order withdrawing federal recognition of transgender identity and declaring that there are only “two sexes.” McCoul eventually replied, “You are under a misconception that what I'm saying is illegal.” She then asked the student to leave.

	











	While the class was canceled shortly after that incident, McCoul wasn't terminated until September, when the student's video was shared by right-wing politicians on social media to stoke outrage among their base. Texas A&M President Mark A. Welsh III then dismissed her and demoted the administrators who had not initially taken disciplinary action in the matter. Then Welsh himself, featured in another viral video where he had defended McCoul to the student, was forced out by the university's Board of Regents, which had long regarded him as insufficiently conservative.

	











	The institutional turmoil at this major public university was just one more example of the ripple effects of a Trump administration that has sought to restrict academic freedom. Across the U.S., many schools have muzzled professors to comply with new state laws against teaching certain topics, or as a proactive means of avoiding the wrath of the president and his allies in the culture wars. Indeed, in November — the same month that a faculty panel ruled that McCoul's firing was “not justified” — A&M's Board of Regents took such a step, approving new policies that prohibited instructors from broaching matters of sexual orientation, gender identity, and race or “gender ideology.”

	Then, ahead of the spring semester, philosophy professor Martin Peterson, who has taught at the school since 2014, submitted the syllabus of his intro-level course “Contemporary Moral Issues” for what he called “mandatory censorship review” in an email to the head of his department. As chair of A&M's Academic Freedom Council, Peterson noted his objections to the new policies, calling them “unconstitutional.” He also wrote that while the new rules forbade any academic course to “advocate race or gender ideology,” this core curriculum class — which he had last taught in 2024 with a nearly identical syllabus — did not “advocate” for any belief. Instead, Peterson clarified, “I teach students how to structure and evaluate arguments commonly raised in discussion of contemporary moral issues.”


	The response from Peterson's department head was curt: Drop the modules on race and gender, along with the Plato readings that touch on these areas, or be reassigned to teach a different course. He had until the end of the day to decide.


	“I've been in meetings with deans and the provost and the president, and talked about this many times, so I knew how they are thinking about all this,” Peterson tells Rolling Stone of the new course guidelines. “I wasn't surprised, just disappointed that the stuff about race and gender was banned. But I was genuinely surprised that I couldn't talk about Plato, and I couldn't ask my students to read what Plato wrote almost two and a half thousand years ago — how that could possibly be considered as too sensitive. Generations of students have read Plato.”

	Peterson tells Rolling Stone that the selections of Plato's Symposium he wanted to assign indeed deal with questions of gender identity and sexual orientation. “Sure, the content is controversial,” he says. “Plato is talking about sex and gender issues, and he is saying things that many people do not agree with. He talks about homosexuality, etc. But still, it's Plato, one of the founding fathers of Western philosophy. The very idea that we shouldn't be allowed to discuss Plato in the philosophy department is absurd.”

	











	Melissa Lane, a philosophy professor at Princeton University and author of Of Rule and Office: Plato's Ideas of the Political, echoes the idea that teaching a philosophical text is not to “advocate” for any particular perspective but to get students pondering the questions and contradictions it raises. “This is especially true in the case of Plato, given the complex nature of his dialogues, which stage debates in ways that challenge readers to think through the issues for themselves,” Lane says. “To treat Plato as advocating any particular ideology is to misunderstand the nature of his writing.” 


	Lane adds that the Symposium “discusses the human erotic drive as a motivating force, not only for sexual and romantic relationships but more broadly for artistic and intellectual creativity,” and “originates the idea of looking for your better half,” inspiration for countless depictions of romantic love. “To eliminate its study is to cut off a major cultural inheritance at the root,” she says. “There is a slippery slope from banning the teaching of Plato's Symposium on a university syllabus, to banning Homer, Sappho, Rumi, many of Shakespeare's sonnets, and more.” Moreover, Lane observes, the Symposium offers dueling narratives in its rhetorical speeches, undermining the conceit that the text pushes for ideological prescriptions. “Of all of Plato's dialogues, the Symposium is the one that is richest in what today might be called viewpoint diversity,” she says.


	In a statement shared by a university spokesperson with Rolling Stone, A&M claimed that Plato would remain on other syllabi despite their requirement that Peterson remove the philosopher from his course readings. “Texas A&M University will teach numerous dialogues by Plato in a variety of courses this semester and will continue to do so in the future,” the administration said. “In alignment with recent system policy, university administrators are reviewing all core curriculum courses to ensure they do not teach race or gender ideology.” The school said that Peterson's materials were rejected insofar as they related to “modules on gender and race ideology,” in violation of rules approved by the Board of Regents, and that it was up to Peterson to comply or have the course reassigned.


	Peterson's predicament may be ridiculous, he says, but it's only the tip of the iceberg: “I just had to censor a small part of my course,” he points out. “I will still be able to teach my course.” Many of his colleagues, meanwhile, “have been reassigned to teach completely different courses,” because their original courses “cannot be taught at all.” Some 200 courses at the university appear to have been affected just before the start of the spring semester — they canceled an introductory sociology class on race and ethnicity, for example, and downgraded the credit students would receive for a communications course on religion and the arts.

	











	“I have received emails from students who support me,” Peterson says of the reactions on campus. “And I should say, I'm not one of those left-wing professors. Many students at A&M are conservative. I received an email from a former student who described himself as Christian and conservative, and who pointed out that it was very helpful to read Plato he was a student here at A&M. Even conservative Christian students agree that free speech is important and that it's worth studying Plato.”


	Rather than teach a different course, Peterson elected to revise his syllabus, replacing the Plato readings with an article in The New York Times about the university's censorship of the original material. Administrators have approved the change, he says, and he's looking forward to teaching it in the context of free speech and academic freedom issues.  “It's going to be very, very fun,” he says. Students who received the amended syllabus also found it annotated to highlight exactly what the school had forbidden Peterson from assigning and which alternative material had been added as a result.


	Lane says that in any case, “a piecemeal ban on individual books in individual classrooms” can hardly diminish the breadth and complexity of the concepts Plato explored. “Plato has for centuries been both celebrated and attacked by both the right and the left, on a range of different issues,” she says. “His ideas have been a starting point for philosophers and political thinkers on all sides. Those who profess to care about preserving the philosophical canon in all its richness — which has been described by [British philosopher] A.H. Whitehead as ‘a series of footnotes to Plato' — should think again.”


	“It's of course bad for our reputation,” Peterson says of the restrictions on coursework. “The idea that syllabi must be pre-approved is not something that any serious research university would be willing to do. It's also bad for our students, right? We withhold important topics from them. Censorship is not a path to academic excellence. The university is on the wrong track.”


	In Peterson's view, A&M may have hoped to preempt future viral incidents like the one that got Melissa McCoul fired last year by keeping politically polarizing subjects out of the classroom altogether. “That was probably what they wanted to do,” he says — but now it's backfired, and the school is once again making headlines. “I don't think anyone is surprised that that didn't work so well. The best way to stay out of the news and focus on research and teaching is probably let professors do what they do best, to teach the topics they find relevant and interesting in worth teaching and not try to micromanage them.”

Back in March of 2025 a casting call was posted for a shoot in the Hudson Valley and Catskill region.

The casting call was for a project, at the time, called Non-View and after some research we found out the film was being directed by Steven Spielberg. On Wikipedia Non-View was described as a ""UFO film.""

If anyone knows how to do a UFO film, it's Steven Spielberg.

Spielberg already had a great main cast lined up for the film including Emily Blunt, Colin Firth, Eve Hewson, Colman Domingo and Josh O'Connor.

The casting call was looking for background actors local to the Hudson Valley that live near Catskill and Haines Falls. These actors would play ""hotel guests, diner patrons and drivers with cars.""

As time went on we learned that the film was actually called Disclosure Day and the trailer was recently released.

We scanned through IMDB to check out possible filming locations.

According to their website the movie was filmed in Huntington, New York on Long Island, New York City, and in parts of New Jersey including Fosterfields Living Historical Farm in Morristown, New Jersey.

But as we mentioned above a casting call was posted looking for extras in Haines Falls and filming was spotted in parts of Westchester.

Take a look at the trailer below and let us know if you see any familiar sights:

While we can't confirm which scenes were filmed locally, some of them have a Hudson Valley vibe. Like this shot:

Additionally, Selena's Diner in Tannersville was closed April 3rd 2025 through April 12th, 2025. If you put together the casting call looking for diner patrons and the shooting dates, it looks like Selena's may be a shooting location.

 

Disclosure Day hits theaters on June 12th, 2026.

We're saving the date for June 12th to see Disclosure Day, but we also have other projects to look forward to.

Season 2 of The Four Seasons on Netflix wrapped up filming in the Hudson Valley around Thanksgiving 2025. You'll see Colman Domingo in 2 Hudson Valley filmed projects as he's in Disclosure Day and Four Seasons.

In early January 2026 Best Medicine aired on Fox starring Josh Charles. The newest Fox show filmed in Orange and Dutchess County for much of 2025.

The Best Medicine set was popular in Wappingers Falls near the New Hamburg Yacht Club, as the show takes place in a New England coastal fishing town.

What Hudson Valley show or movie are you looking forward to most?

      MATT JONES, SENIOR NEWS REPORTER, AUSTRALIA



A group of miners have shared disturbing photos of a 'UFO' they spotted in a remote region of Western Australia during an early-morning drive. 

The six workers were stunned when they saw the airborne object near Fortescue Metals Group's Solomon mine site in the Pilbara region at about 5am on December 7. 

The group spotted the strange object while driving from their laboratory worksite to catch a bus back to camp in the Hamersley Ranges.

According to one witness, it stood out clearly against the morning sky.

'There were six of us in the car,' the witness said.

'The people in the front noticed it first and commented that it looked weird.'

The driver initially thought the object was a cloud, but decided it looked more like a triangular UFO shape often seen in other sightings around the world.

'It can't be,' the shocked witness said.

His friends in the back seat of the vehicle noticed the object shortly afterwards.

'Look at that,' one said.

Another suggested it could be a medical evacuation helicopter, but others disagreed.

'It was in no way shaped like one,' they said, while admitting the distance made it hard to identify clearly with the naked eye.

One of the workers, Afrasiab Khan, took photos of it on his phone.

'That is a genuine UFO, guys,' he told his workmates.

 No official explanation has been provided for the sighting.

Last year, a bizarre object was found on fire in remote WA with no visible signs to indicate how it got there. 

Police coordinated a multi-agency response after the item was found in October near a mining site near the small town of Newman.

The large black object was similar to other known space re-entry debris, WA Police said in a statement.

It sparked intrigue similar to previous UFO sightings across the country.

A month earlier, there were reports of strange lights in the sky near Point Moore in Geraldton, 420km north of Perth.

Perth Observatory received a number of reports of lights across a widespread area which a spokesperson described as 'very confusing'.

The Department of Defence said there were no military training activities in the area on the night of the sightings.","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","other"

Cops in Washington state recently received a rather unusual report from a resident who could not find their cigarettes and suspected that something paranormal was behind the mysterious disappearance. According to a local media report, the Moses Lake Police Department got the odd call last Tuesday morning at around 7:30 AM. The unnamed resident informed the dispatcher that, in a matter of seconds, their hand-rolled cigarettes had just suddenly vanished. With no sign of an intruder or any other explanation for their disappearance, the caller pointed to ""paranormal activity"" as the cause of the curious incident.

A group of researchers has proposed that honeybees could be the key to developing a universal language for communicating with extraterrestrial life.
The theory is based on an eight-year study that found bees are capable of solving simple mathematical problems such as addition and subtraction.
The researchers suggest that if two species as different as humans and honeybees can do math, then it could serve as the basis for a universal language.
    

Research findings

The researchers, who published their thought experiment in the journal Leonardo, noted that humans and bees diverged over 600 million years ago.
    Despite this vast evolutionary gap, both species possess communication skills, social behavior, and some degree of mathematical ability.
    The team believes that if extraterrestrial species exist with sufficiently advanced brains, they may also have the ability to do math.
    

Study details

Between 2016 and 2023, scientists studied how bees learn math by participating in outdoor tests.
    The study found that the insects could do simple addition and subtraction, tell odd from even, and order quantities of items.
    They even understood the concept of zero and could associate the symbols with numbers.
    

Historical attempts

This isn't the first time math has been proposed as a way to communicate with extraterrestrial beings.
    The Golden Records on Voyager 1 and 2 have mathematical quantities etched on them.
    The hope was that aliens would understand these and humans could ""communicate a story of our world to extraterrestrials.""
    Similarly, the 1974 Arecibo radio message sent into space contained 1,679 zeros and ones to convey information about numbers one to 10, and atomic numbers of DNA's building blocks.

Curiosities 

Half of Americans say that aliens According to recent research, they have definitely or probably already visited Earth. This data appears alongside a broader picture: most believe they exist, but the dominant sentiment about an encounter is not celebration, but rather risk.

The survey shows the public divided when it comes to recent visits: 42% say that aliens 41% definitely or probably have been here in recent years, while 41% say the opposite. In the background, the idea that the government is hiding evidence is growing, and the fear of biological consequences outweighs the... scientific curiosity.

The survey was conducted online between November 4 and 9, 2025, with Adult 1.114 from United States. 

Earth's magnetic pole changes course, slowing down for the first time in decades and forcing an urgent update to the global model used by airplanes, ships, GPS and cell phones: the new version promises 10 times greater accuracy.

The United States is experiencing an increase in toxic air pollution, and authorities are urging residents of three states to stay indoors.

Abu Dhabi is creating giant artificial reefs under the sea in the desert, rebuilding ecosystems that died after thermal collapse, and in just one year, surprising scientists by recording the accelerated return of corals, fish, rare species, and essential ecological functions in the Gulf.

Cristiano Ronaldo's new luxury mansion, valued at £30 million in a prime area of ​​Portugal, took over three years to complete. It boasts 900 square meters, eight bedrooms, a glass-enclosed swimming pool, and a garage for his multi-million pound car collection.

The sample was constructed to represent the adult population, weighted by factors such as age, race, education, and voting history, and the approximate margin of error for the total was... 4 percentage points.

Within this framework, 56% stated that aliens They definitely or probably exist. 

When the question moves on to visits to Earth, 47% say that aliens They definitely or probably visited the planet at some point, indicating that the belief is not restricted to abstract existence.

Regarding UFOs, 30% believe that unidentified flying objects are likely alien spacecraft or life forms, while 45% say there is some other explanation. 

The contrast shows that, even among those who accept the possibility of aliensHowever, there is a high barrier to directly associating UFOs with alien origins.

The portrait also changes according to party affiliation. 

Democrats appear more likely than Republicans to assert that aliens There are those who attribute UFOs to alien origins, while independent theories remain in an intermediate position, reinforcing how the topic intersects with politics, institutional trust, and the interpretation of evidence.

When surveyed about the effects of a visit, Americans are about twice as likely to say it would be negative than positive: 29% indicate a negative effect, compared to 14% who see a positive effect, and 25% who assess that it would be neither positive nor negative.

The specific fear is evident in the clear numbers. 

For 55%, it is very or somewhat likely that aliens They would introduce new diseases capable of infecting humans. 

Furthermore, 43% think it's likely they would unintentionally injure or kill people, and 43% consider it likely they would come in peace, a tie that translates to... ambivalence More than certain.

Most people believe that, if they exist, aliens They would be far more technologically advanced than humans, with 74% stating this. 

Also, 66% consider it likely that they would wish to remain hidden from humans, which supports the narrative of a discreet presence that is difficult to prove.

Regarding communication, 50% believe it would be likely that aliens were able to communicate with humans. 

At the same time, only 29% think it's likely they would have a sense of humor, a detail that reinforces how the collective imagination tends to portray them as enigmatic and potentially dangerous, not as friendly visitors.

The perception of a lack of transparency is one of the central themes. 

Three-quarters of Americans, 73%, believe that if the U.S. government had proof of the existence of UFOs, it would hide it from the public. Only 13% think the government would release this information.

Personal experience also enters the debate. One in five Americans, 21%, say they have seen something they thought was a UFO. 

Among these, 28% believe it was more likely to originate from aliens, while 48% point to another explanation, maintaining the division even when there is a direct report.

The research also maps expectations of future contact.

Only 16% believe we will make contact with extraterrestrial life in the next 10 years, but this percentage grows with the time horizon: 29% in 50 years, 42% in 100 years, and 46% in 200 years.

The most significant difference arises between those who already believe in visits: between those who say that aliens Of those who have already visited Earth, 31% believe contact will occur within 10 years and 53% within 50 years. 

Among those who don't believe in visits, only 2% expect contact within 10 years, showing how current beliefs shape the... Predicting the future.

In your opinion, this fear of aliens Does it stem more from the risk of disease, distrust in the government, or the cultural impact of admitting that we are not alone?

Morocco coach Walid Regragui has firmly rejected suggestions that officials at the Africa Cup of Nations have shown favouritism towards the host nation. 

Conspiracy theories alleging leniency from tournament referees have been circulating among some broadcast pundits and online supporters, but Regragui dismissed these claims outright.

""It's always a shame to go down this path,"" he told a press conference on Tuesday as Morocco prepared to take on Nigeria in their semi-final in Rabat on Wednesday.

""They want to make people believe that matches are always won this way. Let's not kid ourselves, it's always been the case on the African continent to sow doubts and controversies.

""You journalists need to do your job,"" he added.

""A penalty can be given one way in one match and not in another. A handball is called in one match and not in another. I watch a lot of matches because we have many players in Europe, and the controversies are the same everywhere, in Africa or in Europe.""

Regragui said he believed referees at the tournament were seeking to do their best, but also gave example of incidents in matches where he felt the whistle did not favour Morocco.

He cited two incidents from their impressive 2-0 win over Cameroon in their quarter-final on Friday to illustrate his argument.

""One of their defenders puts his foot on Abde (Ezzalzouli)'s ankle, and if VAR reviews the play, it's a penalty,"" he said.

""The goalkeeper comes out to challenge (Ismael) Saibari and puts both hands in his head, that's a penalty. But neither were given.""

Regragui said he had told his players to ignore any refereeing controversy.

""The only way to win is on the pitch, by winning our matches. You've never heard me talk about the refereeing after a match,"" he said.

""We take responsibility, we move forward, and we work hard. That's the goal. We need to support the referees, the players, and stop always feeling like we're being wronged.

""We hope the referee will be fair to both teams tomorrow, as he has been since the start of the competition,"" the coach added.

A 2025 satellite image shows a series of ghostly ice swirls sculpted on the surface of Lake Michigan by strong winds during an extreme cold snap that covered Chicago in a blanket of snow.

Where is it? Chicago, Illinois [41.85802928, -87.57938545]

What's in the photo? Ice swirling around the edge of Lake Michigan

Which satellite took the photo? Landsat 8

When was it taken? Jan. 24, 2025

This striking satellite photo shows rippling ribbons of ethereal ice swirling like turbulent clouds on the surface of Lake Michigan, alongside a snow-covered Chicago. The wintery scene occurred during an extreme cold snap triggered by changes to the polar vortex, experts say.

The greater Chicago region is home to around 9.5 million people and is near the southernmost end of Lake Michigan — the third-largest of the Great Lakes, which covers an area of around 22,300 square miles (57,750 square kilometers) across Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Michigan.

Between Jan. 19 and Jan. 24, 2025, the Windy City and other parts of the eastern U.S. were hit by an unusual cold snap, partially triggered by a sudden expansion of the polar vortex — the persistent area of cold, low-pressure air circulating high in the stratosphere above the Arctic. During this time, temperatures in Chicago fell to as low as minus 33 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 36 degrees Celsius), according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

This sudden drop in temperature, coupled with strong offshore winds, caused ice to form around the coastline and be pushed outward, creating the beautiful swirls. These flowing ribbons look a lot like clouds when viewed from above, but they are entirely ice, according to NASA's Earth Observatory.

In total, around 20% of Lake Michigan was covered by ice when the satellite photo was taken, which is just above average for the time of year, according to NOAA's Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL).

 




While lake ice is common in January, the extent of ice on Lake Michigan doesn't normally peak until February or March. It is also more common to see uniform sheets of ice rather than the flowing patterns visible in this image.

In this case, the darker, wispy ice near the lakeshore likely accumulated into thicker offshore constructs with rough edges that appear more white when viewed from above, Jia Wang, an ice climatologist at GLERL, told the Earth Observatory.

Other Great Lakes were also impacted by the cold snap, including Lake Erie, which saw up to 80% of its surface frozen, according to GLERL. Erie's ice was so thick and emerged so quickly that a Canadian cargo freighter was trapped in place for three days, according to the New York Times.

This is not the first time that satellite photos have revealed something unusual about Lake Michigan. In 2024, aerial images helped researchers identify more than 40 mysterious craters scattered across the lake's bed, which currently have no definitive explanation.

The low temperatures and strong winds around Chicago can also cause other unusual winter sights, such as bizarre chess piece-like sand sculptures along Lake Michigan's beaches, known as ""hoodoos,"" which form when frozen chunks of sand are exposed to strong gusts.

What if the deepest human drive isn't happiness, survival, or even love, but the need to matter?

Philosopher and MacArthur Fellow Rebecca Newberger Goldstein joins Michael Shermer to discuss The Mattering Instinct, her argument that the desire to feel significant lies at the core of human behavior. That drive helps explain our greatest achievements, from creativity and moral courage to scientific and artistic excellence. It also helps explain some of our darkest outcomes, including extremism, violence, and ideological fanaticism.

Goldstein examines why people will give up comfort, status, and sometimes even their own lives to feel that they matter. She questions why meaning cannot be captured by happiness metrics or self-help formulas, and why the same psychological force can produce saints, scientists, athletes, cult leaders, and terrorists. The conversation moves through free will, entropy, morality without God, fame, narcissism, and the crucial difference between ways of mattering that create order and those that leave damage behind.

Rebecca Newberger Goldstein is an award-winning philosopher, writer, and public intellectual. She is the author of ten books of acclaimed fiction and non-fiction, including 36 Arguments for the Existence of God: A Work of Fiction and Betraying Spinoza: The Renegade Jew Who Gave Us Modernity. She holds a Ph.D. in philosophy of science from Princeton University and has taught at Yale, Columbia, NYU, Dartmouth, and Harvard. A fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, her work has been supported by the MacArthur ""Genius"" grant and fellowships from the Guggenheim, Whiting Institute, Radcliffe Institute, and the National Science Foundation. Her new book is The Mattering Instinct: How Our Deepest Longing Drives Us and Divides Us.

Americans are racking up credit card debt, and it's costing them even more to get rid of it.

It's a piece of the affordability debate that has caught the attention of both parties.

In a move that has been pushed for by lawmakers across the aisle, President Donald Trump on January 9 called for a one-year, 10% cap on credit-card interest rates. He wrote in a Truth Social post that he would call for the cap to begin on January 20.

""Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, and even more, which festered unimpeded during the Sleepy Joe Biden Administration,"" Trump wrote.

Are you struggling with credit card debt, or have a story to share about credit card interest rates? Contact these reporters at asheffey@businessinsider.com and jkaplan@businessinsider.com.

The easiest path for Trump to cap interest rates would be through congressional legislation. While it's unclear if the proposal would make it through Congress and onto the president's desk, given that similar legislation has yet to become law, Sen. Elizabeth Warren signaled she would work with the president on making it happen.

Warren said in a statement that during a Monday call with Trump, she ""told him that Congress can pass legislation to cap credit card rates if he will actually fight for it.""

However, beyond the mechanics of the proposal, the underlying sentiment — that credit card companies have ""ripped off"" consumers by charging excessive interest — is an issue that has plagued the US for decades as debt loads continue to rise.

In the third quarter of 2025, the most recent period for which data is available, credit card debt reached a record high of $1.23 trillion — a $24 billion increase from the previous quarter and a $67 billion increase from Q3 2024.

Credit card companies took issue with Trump's proposal. A joint statement from the Bank Policy Institute, American Bankers Association, Consumer Bankers Association, Financial Services Forum, and Independent Community Bankers of America said that the ""cap would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives"" such as personal and payday loans. Banks typically use higher interest rates to compensate for customers who may not be able to repay their loans.

Bill Ackman, a hedge fund billionaire, also voiced his concerns, writing in a post on X that while he thinks Trump's proposal is ""important,"" capping rates would ""cause millions of Americans to have their cards cancelled as credit card companies lose the ability to adequately price subprime credit risk.""

Trump promised a 10% credit-card interest rate cap on the campaign trail, and his latest announcement follows recent bipartisan legislation pushing for a similar move.

In February 2025, Sens. Bernie Sanders and Josh Hawley introduced a bill capping rates at 10% for five years, with the GOP's Hawley saying in a statement at the time that ""working Americans are drowning in record credit card debt while the biggest credit card issuers get richer and richer by hiking their interest rates to the moon.""

Even as the Federal Reserve has stepped in to broadly lower interest rates, credit card rates have edged down but remained near record highs over the past year. That means that the Americans trying to chip away at their record-high credit card debt are paying more on those outstanding balances.

It's not a glitch in the system that consumers are getting trapped by high interest rates — it's a feature, consumer protection experts previously told Business Insider. Hidden fees and shady terms can pull consumers in, and they won't realize what they signed up for until it's too late, Adam Rust, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America, said.

""Credit-card companies can get away with charging high rates of interest because consumers aren't necessarily paying attention, and marketing doesn't focus on that,"" Rust said.

At the same time, as creditors accrue higher debt loads and contend with higher interest rates, an increasing share of loans is simply going unpaid for 30 days or more.

There's limited legal recourse for consumers. A 1978 Supreme Court decision allowed banks headquartered in states without usury laws — which aim to prevent companies from unfairly enriching themselves at the expense of borrowers — to set their own interest rates without impunity.

Oversight over the industry is lacking, especially after the Trump administration moved to gut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The CFPB conducts oversight of the industry and, in a 2023 report, found that credit-card companies charged consumers over $105 billion in interest in 2022, helping to boost their profit margins from 4.5% in 2019 to 5.9%.

The world's most senior central bankers are rallying around Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell after he said the US government was attempting to pressure the central bank on monetary policy.

On Tuesday, a letter cosigned by the heads of 10 global central banking institutions defended Powell's integrity, calling him a ""respected colleague held in the highest regard by all who have worked with him.""

""We stand in full solidarity with the Federal Reserve System and its Chair Jerome H. Powell,"" the letter read.

""The independence of central banks is a cornerstone of price, financial and economic stability in the interest of the citizens that we serve. It is therefore critical to preserve that independence, with full respect for the rule of law and democratic accountability. Chair Powell has served with integrity, focused on his mandate and an unwavering commitment to the public interest,"" the letter read.

The statement was signed by Christine Lagarde, head of the European Central Bank, and Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England chief, as well as central bank bosses from Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, Australia, Canada, South Korea, and Brazil, alongside the chair and general managers of the Bank for International Settlements.

The letter comes after Powell revealed on Sunday that the Federal Reserve had been served grand jury subpoenas by the Department of Justice, which was widely viewed as the latest escalation in an ongoing dispute between the central bank and the Trump administration over the path of interest rates.

""No one — certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve — is above the law,"" Powell said in a video statement on Sunday. ""But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.""

On Monday, a group of senior figures in US economics and monetary policy, including all three living former heads of the Fed, and five former Treasury secretaries, rallied behind Powell.

That statement called the investigation ""an unprecedented attempt to use prosecutorial attacks to undermine"" the independence of the Fed.

""It has no place in the United States whose greatest strength is the rule of law, which is at the foundation of our economic success,"" the statement added.

            Bill and Hillary Clinton refused to testify on Capitol Hill Tuesday in the House Oversight Committee's Jeffrey Epstein probe despite lawmakers' threat to hold them in contempt.
    


            “You will say it is not our decision to make. But we have made it. Now you have to make yours,” the Clintons wrote in an apparent challenge to Republican Chairman James Comer, who set a final deadline for appearances this week.
    


            Comer told reporters Wednesday the committee would meet next week to move forward with proceedings for Bill Clinton — leaving open the door that the former Secretary of State could still change her mind.
    


            The move marks an escalation in the panel's efforts to bring the former president in for a closed-door interview as part of its Epstein investigation. Successful contempt votes by the GOP-controlled House would be both symbolic — as rebukes to the Clintons — and could be used as a tool to compel them to testify. It could also have legal consequences if the former president continues to resist cooperation and the courts or the Justice Department decide to take it up.
    


            “It's important to note that this subpoena was voted on in a bipartisan manner by this committee. This wasn't something that I just issued as chairman of the committee. This was voted on by the entire committee in a unanimous vote of the House Oversight Committee to subpoena former President Clinton and former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton,” Comer said. “Now Hillary Clinton supposed to show up tomorrow. We'll see what happens there.”
    


            The Clintons laid out their personal and legal qualms with the request in a series of letters, obtained by CNN, penned by themselves and their lawyers.
    


            The pair asserted in the letters that they were being unfairly singled out — noting seven other subpoenaed in-person appearances have been waived. Calling the panel's subpoenas “invalid and legally unenforceable,” they outlined what they said were unprecedented harms being pushed by the administration.
    


            “Every person has to decide when they have seen or had enough and are ready to fight for this country, its principles and its people, no matter the consequences. For us, now is that time,” they wrote.
    


            They added later: “Indeed, bringing the Republicans' cruel agenda to a standstill while you work harder to pass a contempt charge against us than you have done on your investigation this past year would be our contribution to fighting the madness.”
    


            After the panel meets next week, the House GOP leadership would have to schedule a vote on the House floor. A vote by the full House to hold Clinton in criminal contempt of Congress would set up a referral to the Department of Justice, which would then have to decide whether to prosecute.
    


            The panel unanimously issued subpoenas to the Clintons in August for depositions and has been privately negotiating with their legal counsel to try to set a date for both Clintons to appear for closed-door interviews.
    


            The Clintons claimed they “have tried to give you the little information we have.”
    


            “We've done so because Mr. Epstein's crimes were horrific,” they told Comer. “If the Government didn't do all it could to investigate and prosecute these crimes, for whatever reason, that should be the focus of your work – to learn why and to prevent that from happening ever again. There is no evidence that you are doing so.”
    


            But Comer has appeared unmoved.
    


            The chairman has noted that Epstein visited the White House 17 times when Bill Clinton was president, and that he flew on Epstein's plane around 27 times after he was president.
    


            “To my knowledge, former President Clinton has never answered questions about Epstein, and we just had questions, because again, I think anyone would … admit they spent a lot of time together while Bill Clinton was president and post presidency, and again, no one's accused the Clintons of any problem. We just have questions,” he said Tuesday.
    


            Comer and Clinton got into an exchange on social media on Tuesday, with Clinton arguing his position was about “right and wrong” and Comer responding with some of the photos DOJ released of Clinton as part of the Epstein files.
    


            Of the thousands of documents related to Epstein that the Department of Justice was compelled to release, several are never-before-seen photographs of Bill Clinton with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.
    


One image shows a shirtless Bill Clinton in a jacuzzi next to another person whose face is redacted. There are additional photos of him swimming in an adjacent pool with Maxwell. These pictures show another woman swimming with Bill Clinton and Maxwell, but her face is redacted.
    


            Yet another showed Bill Clinton holding a drink and standing next to Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 while in prison awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.
    


            It's unclear where or when these photographs were taken.
    


            Bill Clinton has never been accused by law enforcement of any wrongdoing related to Epstein, and a spokesperson has repeatedly said he cut ties with Epstein before his arrest on federal charges in 2019 and didn't know about his crimes.
    


            “The White House hasn't been hiding these files for months only to dump them late on a Friday to protect Bill Clinton,” Angel Ureña, a spokesperson for Clinton, said in a statement in December when the photos were released. “This is about shielding themselves from what comes next, or from what they'll try and hide forever. So they can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want, but this isn't about Bill Clinton.”
    


            Democrats on the House Oversight Committee have also released photos from Epstein's estate showing the many powerful figures in the late sex offender's orbit, including Bill Clinton. In one photo, he is pictured with Epstein, Maxwell and another couple.

Four leaders left civil rights division while FBI presses on with inquiry into victim Renee Nicole Good

Four of the leaders of a crucial division in the US justice department have resigned in protest over a decision not to investigate the recent fatal shooting of an unarmed US citizen by a federal immigration agent in Minneapolis – even as the FBI presses ahead with an inquiry into the victim instead.

The lawyers left the civil rights division, which has a criminal investigations unit that investigates the use of force by police officers, according to MS Now, citing three people it said were briefed about the departures.

It follows a decision by Harmeet Dhillon, the Trump administration-aligned assistant attorney general for civil rights, not to investigate the 7 January killing of Renee Nicole Good by Jonathan Ross, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent, as would be usual in the case of a shooting by law enforcement.

Dhillon told the unit the week before that it would not be involved in any investigation, Reuters reported a source as saying.

A justice department spokesperson confirmed the resignations in a statement to the Guardian but denied they were related to the Minneapolis shooting.

“Although we typically don't comment on personnel matters, we can confirm that the criminal section leadership gave notice to depart the civil rights division and requested to participate in the Department of Justice's early retirement program well before the events in Minnesota,” the statement said. “Any suggestion to the contrary is false.”

Separately, the FBI – which seized total control of the investigation after freezing out local officials – is looking into Good's “possible connections to activist groups”, according to the New York Times.

A succession of Trump administration officials, including the president himself, have portrayed Good, without presenting evidence, as a “domestic terrorist” or “paid agitator” – while video of her confrontation with Ross appears to show her trying to steer her vehicle away from him when she was shot three times in the face.

Multiple career prosecutors in Dhillon's office offered to lead an inquiry into the shooting but were told not to do so, CBS News reported on Friday.

The resignations are the latest in a flow of departures from the civil rights division since Donald Trump began his second term a year earlier. In May, the Guardian reported that more than 250 attorneys had left, been reassigned or accepted a deferred resignation offer since January, a roughly 70% reduction.

Dhillon, a former Republican official in California, and an election denier who promoted the “big lie” that Trump's 2020 election defeat was fraudulent, was confirmed by the Senate in April. She worked quickly to realign the division's priorities away from its longstanding work tackling discrimination and protecting the rights of marginalized groups and towards Trump's political goals, including exposing voter fraud, which is rare, and focusing on anti-transgender issues.

“I don't think it's an overstatement to see this as the end of the division as we've known it,” a civil rights division attorney told the Guardian at the time.

Subsequently, in September, the online news outlet Notus reported that only two lawyers remained out of 36 at the justice department's public integrity unit assigned to investigations of corrupt politicians and law enforcement.

“Investigating officials to determine if they broke the law, defied policy, failed to de-escalate and resorted to deadly force without basis is one of the civil rights division's most solemn duties,” Kristen Clarke, who led the division in the Biden administration, told MS Now.

“Prosecutors of the civil rights division have, for decades, been the nation's leading experts in this work.”

The FBI investigation into Good's alleged links to activist groups protesting ICE activities in Minneapolis and elsewhere, meanwhile, aligns with White House messaging seeking to blame the victim for her death and absolve the ICE agent of responsibility.

In the days since Good's killing, numerous Trump administration officials, including Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, have repeatedly alleged without evidence that she was engaging in domestic terrorism – and that Ross was forced to shoot to save his own life and the lives of others. Good, Noem said, had been “stalking” officers.

JD Vance, the vice-president, repeated the claims in an angry rant during a White House press briefing on Thursday, alleging Good was part of a “broader leftwing network” working tirelessly and using “domestic terror techniques” to stop the Trump administration from enforcing immigration laws. He offered no evidence to back up his claim.

Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Trump published a post on his Truth Social platform asking: “Do the people of Minnesota really want to live in a community where there are thousands of … deadly criminals too dangerous to even mention.”

Family members say Good, a mother of three children, had just dropped her six-year-old son off at school. And video shows her waving ICE vehicles past her car despite the insistence of Vance and others that she was deliberately blocking traffic and “impeding” their work.

“This is classic terrorism,” Vance said.

Officials in Minneapolis have contradicted the administration's assertions and condemned its rush to judgment before an investigation had taken place.

            Iran has deployed new techniques to swiftly and decisively crush nationwide protests, signaling a tactical shift by a regime that now views domestic dissent as an extension of the summer war with Israel.
    


            What began as the regime's age-old riot-control methods quickly escalated into advanced techniques to suppress protests, combining cutting-edge military technology with sophisticated psychological operations, according to experts.
    


            Low-flying surveillance drones, signal jammers, a rapid-response propaganda apparatus, and the violent deployment of force were unleashed simultaneously by a regime keen to learn from each wave of unrest.
    


            Iran's latest playbook to crush dissent reflects lessons adopted after deep Israeli infiltration of the country shocked and embarrassed the regime due to the role in played in Israel's success in the 12-day war in June. The increasingly paranoid government now frames the latest wave of domestic unrest as the “thirteenth day of war” with Israel, painting protesters as foreign agents that need to be “dealt with.”
    


            Protesters were heavily surveilled with CCTV cameras on the streets, but even those who chose to protest from their homes by shouting anti-regime slogans from their windows were being watched. Iranian police distributed a video titled “Identifable Sounds” showing drones hovering outside apartment buildings to find people chanting against the regime.
    


            Set to  ominous background music, the footage showed a drone operator peering into residential windows to identify people chanting “death to the dictator,” followed by scenes of security officials marking buildings with warning stickers, and in some cases, arresting residents.
    


            “We got information that someone in your building was chanting and it was coming from your apartment,” a member of the security forces tells a man in the blurred video posted by Iranian media outlets on social media. The post citing Iran's national police read, “Everything is under surveillance.”
    


            Another tactic involved a communications blackout at an unprecedented scale. For days, Iran became nearly impossible to reach from the outside world. Even SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet terminals, used by Iranians to circumvent the restrictions, were jammed using what experts describe as military-grade technology.
    


            “I haven't seen anything like that at all. It was not regular jamming, they have some sort of military equipment,” Amir Rashidi, an Iranian cybersecurity expert and director at New York City-based Miaan group, a digital advocacy group, said.
    


            The country's decades-long push to nationalize its internet infrastructure – accelerated by intensifying international sanctions – has given the state far greater capacity to censor, throttle and control online activity.
    


            Iran completely shut down the internet during the 2019 fuel-price protests and the 2022 women's rights demonstrations. But the scale and sophistication of the recent blackout demonstrates significant advancements in the government's ability to activate and enforce communications control.
    


            “You now see near total automation of the process… and it's almost an instantaneous process at that point,” Alp Toker, the founder of internet monitoring group Netblocks, told CNN. “It's amongst the most severe internet disruptions we've tracked around the world.”
    


            Rashidi said the Starlink terminals were being jammed, using methods like those employed by the Russian military in Ukraine.
    


            “They (the regime) haven't tried to jam Starlink before. They are definitely better than ever,” Rashidi said.
    


            Although Starlink is not officially licensed to operate in Iran, Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX which owns Starlink, had previously stated that the service is active and available in the country.
    


            Nationwide protests have continued in Iran for two weeks but escalated significantly on January 10. Crowds, some of them violent, took to the street demanding the overthrow of the regime, triggering an unprecedented level of violence that left hundreds killed, with thousands arrested.
    


            The crackdown that followed, lasting almost three days, may have produced one of the highest death tolls since Iran's 1979 revolution. Iran has yet to take responsibility or admit that it killed protesters, instead claiming that protesters were killed by “rioters” employed by Israel and the United States.
    


            In past protests, that level of response would have taken the government weeks to activate. But the rapid mobilization of the Basij paramilitary force – which was also deployed on the streets to identify infiltrators during the war with Israel – signals a willingness of authorities to employ deadly violence as it grows increasingly paranoid of dissent and labels it as a foreign conspiracy.
    


            “It's a delicate time for them. It's not a surprise that they have responded in a such an aggressive and heavy-handed manner as they're afraid,” Matthew Levitt, a counter terrorism expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “The regime is now fighting against its own people.”
    


            Following the war with Israel, official discourse in Iran acknowledged that the strikes exposed the country's weaknesses. This appears to have shaped internal thinking about the country's strategic position and allowed the regime to portray protesters as agents of the enemy, while granting itself greater justification to unleash intensified violence against them.
    


            The regime's propaganda apparatus, operating through state-run and government-affiliated media outlets, has worked to instill fear, repeatedly warning citizens that they are under constant surveillance and cautioning against joining the protests. In an unusually grim move, state television aired a report from a morgue showing rows of body bags, apparently intended to deter potential demonstrators from joining.
    


            It was also quick to release figures on security force deaths and to accuse “rioters” of killing civilians. State media aired footage of dozens of blindfolded detainees lined up against walls, broadcast confessions, and released images of seized weapons, including what appeared to be axes and daggers carried by the protesters.
    


            Massive crowds filled public squares in state-sanctioned demonstrations to show unwavering support for the regime, as loyalists reacted with outrage to footage of violence against the Islamic Republic.

            By Monday, there were signs that protests in Tehran were not as big as they had been over the weekend, following the massive regime crackdown, though gauging the true scale is all but impossible given the ongoing communications blackout. Iran's foreign minister felt confident enough on Monday to claim that the government had the situation “under control.”
    


            It is possible, however, that protests could ramp back up following President Trump's renewed call on Tuesday for Iranians to keep demonstrating, coupled with his vow that “help is on the way.”
    


            “KEEP PROTESTING - TAKE OVER YOUR INSTITUTIONS!!! Save the names of the killers and abusers. They will pay a big price,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.

            Elsa Avila stood up to tell some of her students to hide farther from the window when they heard gunfire at their elementary school in Uvalde, Texas.
    


            “As I stood there, and I was waving them over, that's when — we were hearing shots, and I felt a shot on my left side,” she said.
    


            “I felt the pain. I felt the burning pain, and I know I yelled, ‘Oh no, I'm shot.' And I fell to the floor.”
    


            Avila, a fourth-grade teacher at Robb Elementary, which was targeted by a teenage gunman, said Tuesday she managed to text for help as she lay on the floor and then thought of her students.
    


            She said she was in immense pain and her legs were shaking, suggesting to her that she was going into shock. So she prayed, “Don't let me die in front of my students.”
    


            “I couldn't do anything; I couldn't comfort them,” Avila said, breaking down into tears.
    


            Nineteen children and two teachers were killed in the May 2022 massacre.
    


            Later that day, she helped push her students to law enforcement officers through a window before she was helped out. With no stretcher available, she had to walk to an ambulance, she said.
    


            The response to the shooting has faced widespread criticism, not only for the actions of law enforcement but also for the medical response and crime scene investigation.
    


            But the case against former school district police officer Adrian Gonzales focuses on the first minutes, as both the gunman and Gonzales arrived on campus.
    


            Gonzales has pleaded not guilty to 29 charges of endangering or abandoning a child. Prosecutors allege he was told where the shooter was heading and had enough time to act.
    


            The attack remains one of the deadliest US school shootings, a continuing scourge that has spurred security measures in classrooms across America.
    


            Avila retired from teaching after the attack, saying she could not even step inside a school. But she missed working with students so much, she said, that she resumed her career, this time at a private parochial school.
    


• Surviving teacher said his door was not locked: Former teacher Arnulfo Reyes was questioned repeatedly in court Tuesday about how doors were left open at Robb Elementary.
    


            Reyes, the only survivor in his classroom, and called to testify by prosecutors who have accused Gonzales of failing to do enough to stop or delay the shooter.
    


            Defense attorney Nico LaHood had Reyes confirm that the door to his classroom was not locked on the day of the massacre, when Reyes saw sheetrock flying amid gunfire and told his students to hide.
    


            “Hiding the kids isn't as effective if that door is not locked,” LaHood said, then asking Reyes: “The fact that the door was not locked had an effect on the gunman entering the room?”
    


            “Yes,” Reyes replied.
    


            LaHood also questioned how well the children were hidden in Room 111. They were underneath tables, but unlike in the classroom next door, there were no curtains around the table edges to shield them from view, he said, and Reyes agreed.
    


‘Nobody moved but me': Watch Uvalde teacher's emotional recounting of school shooting



            Teachers testified earlier in the trial that some rooms had curtains on the tables around the edges to cover supplies stored there.
    


            Reyes said the lights were off in the room and the children went where they were trained to go.
    


Teacher relives the day all his students were killed in Uvalde massacre for officer's trial



            Reyes testified Monday that “a black shadow” holding a gun entered his classroom and shot him, then all the children hid under furniture.
    


            Eleven students were killed in Reyes' classroom and eight more in a connected classroom. Two teachers died after being shot in the next-door classroom. Ten of their students survived the massacre. It took 77 minutes for the gunman to be stopped by the hundreds of law enforcement officers who converged on the scene after he entered the school.
    


            Reyes has pictures of all the students who were killed on the fence outside his home in Uvalde. On Monday, he looked at photos displayed in court of those who died and the 10 who survived, naming each for the jury.

PRETORIA, January 13. /TASS/. Iran will withdraw from a naval drill currently taking place off the coast of South Africa involving a number of BRICS member countries at Pretoria's request, News 24 reported.

South Africa requested that Iran withdraw its ships from the Will for Peace naval drill and participate as observers following diplomatic discussions. According to News 24, the Iranian side treated the request with understanding. As a result, two Iranian Navy vessels that have already arrived in South Africa will not be taking a direct part in the exercise which runs until January 16.

South Africa's request came amid Pretoria's reluctance to further strain its relations with the United States, given the ongoing complicated trade talks between the two countries, News 24 noted.

The Will for Peace naval exercise kicked off in the southern Atlantic near the Cape of Good Hope on January 9. Warships from China, the United Arab Emirates, and South Africa as well as the Russian Navy corvette Stoikiy and the Baltic Fleet's medium sea tanker Yelnya are taking part. Brazil, Indonesia and Ethiopia are participating as observers. Operational command of the drill is being carried out by the Chinese Navy.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Experts say obscuring plane's military identity would constitute a war crime

The US aircraft that carried out the first airstrike on a suspected drug-trafficking boat in the Caribbean was reportedly disguised as a civilian plane – a possible war crime.

The New York Times reported that the aircraft had been painted to obscure its military identity, and its munitions were hidden inside its fuselage rather than visible under its wings.

The 2 September attack on a small boat last year killed 11 Venezuelans, including two survivors from the first strike who were clinging to wreckage in the water when they were bombed a second time. The Venezuelan government denied that the dead men had been gang members, and Washington presented no proof they were involved in drug smuggling.

The Trump administration went on to kill more than 120 people in 35 separate attacks on small boats in the Caribbean and Pacific, in what it said was a counter-narcotics campaign in the run-up to this month's direct attack on Venezuela.

The Pentagon has justified the killings on the grounds that the US is at war with drug trafficking cartels. Most international legal experts reject that and say the attacks amount to murder.

Even if the claim of being at war is justified, specialists in the laws of war say the use of a plane disguised to look like a civilian aircraft, so that its targets would be caught off-guard, would represent the war crime of “perfidy” under international and US military legal standards.

“If we move from the legally incorrect premise that this is a lethal operation governed by the laws of war, then the concept of perfidy here is relevant,” Nehal Bhuta, professor of public international law at the University of Edinburgh, said.

Bhuta said the use of civilian disguises in war would have a corrosive effect, for example making every airliner with civilian markings a potential target. “This is precisely the destructive slippery slope that a firm commitment to prohibition against perfidy is aimed to avoid,” he said.

He added, however, that in the absence of an armed conflict, the “perfidy” issue was irrelevant as the strikes should be classed as extra-judicial killings.

“Fundamentally, the debate about ‘war crimes' is a distraction – the whole operation is illegal, and the conduct of an extrajudicial execution by means of a plane with civilian markings is in fact reminiscent of a death squad operation,” Bhuta said.

The US Law of War manual defines perfidy as “acts that invite the confidence of enemy persons to lead them to believe that they are entitled to, or are obliged to accord, protection under the law of war, with intent to betray that confidence”. It provides the example of “feigning civilian status and then attacking”.

The Commander's Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations, used by the US Navy, Marines and Coast Guard, states that “honor prohibits perfidy” and gives the example of “feigning non-hostile relations in order to seek a military advantage”.

The handbook for the military commissions, set up to judge terror suspects held in Guantánamo Bay prison camp, also has a section on “using treachery or perfidy”. One inmate was charged with perfidy for the 2000 al-Qaida attack on the USS Cole, in which the attackers waved in friendly manner as they approached the US warship in a small boat packed with explosives.

The military commission handbook stipulates the death sentence “if the death of any person occurs as a result of the improper use of treachery or perfidy”.

The New York Times report said it was unclear what kind of aircraft was used, or how exactly it was disguised, but noted that the US military had modified civilian aircraft, such as Boeing 737s and Cessna turboprops, which have internal weapons bays and have been reported by plane spotters painted white with minimal markings.

The report said that since the initial September airstrike, the US military has switched to using identifiably military aircraft, including drones, though added it was unclear whether those aircraft were at low enough altitude to be seen by their targets.

The Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment, but told the New York Times that the US military used “a range of standard and non-standard aircraft” and that before any deployment “they go through a rigorous procurement process to ensure compliance with domestic law, department policies and regulations, and applicable international standards, including the law of armed conflict”.

Craig Jones, an expert on the laws of war and a senior lecturer in political geography at Newcastle University, said that in the past, the US military's legal advisers in the judge advocate general (JAG) corps would have been consulted on the use of civilian disguise, to give a view on whether it was compliant with US and international law. However, the current defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, fired the top JAGs soon after taking office and has limited the role of those who remain.

“The problem now with the Trump administration is that he's sidelining all the JAGs, either shutting them out entirely, not listening to them, or getting rid of them,” Jones said. “We're left with a quite terrifying situation whereby those who are supposed to be ensuring compliance are not even part of the conversation – unless they are willing to ‘get to yes'.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth on Monday said that Elon Musk's artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot Grok would join Google's generative AI engine in operating inside the Pentagon network, as part of a broader push to feed as much of the military's data as possible into the developing technology.

“Very soon we will have the world's leading AI models on every unclassified and classified network throughout our department,” Hegseth said in a speech at Musk's space flight company, SpaceX, in south Texas.

The announcement comes just days after Grok — which is embedded into X, the social media network owned by Musk — drew global outcry and scrutiny for generating highly sexualized deepfake images of people without their consent.

Malaysia and Indonesia have blocked Grok, while the UK's independent online safety watchdog on Monday announced an investigation. Grok has limited image generation and editing to paying users.

Hegseth said Grok would go live inside the US Department of Defense later this month and announced that he would “make all appropriate data” from the military's IT systems available for “AI exploitation.” 

He also said data from intelligence databases would be fed into AI systems.

Hegseth's aggressive push to embrace the still-developing technology stands in contrast to the administration of former US president Joe Biden, which, while pushing federal agencies to come up with policies and uses for AI, was also wary of misuse. Officials said rules were needed to ensure that the technology, which could be harnessed for mass surveillance, cyberattacks or even lethal autonomous devices, was being used responsibly.

During his speech, Hegseth spoke of the need to streamline and speed up technological innovations within the military, saying: “We need innovation to come from anywhere and evolve with speed and purpose.”

He added that the Pentagon possesses “combat-proven operational data from two decades of military and intelligence operations.”

“AI is only as good as the data that it receives, and we're going to make sure that it's there,” he said.

The defense secretary said he wanted AI systems within the Pentagon to be responsible, but added that he was shrugging off any AI models “that won't allow you to fight wars.”

Hegseth said his vision for military AI systems means that they operate “without ideological constraints that limit lawful military applications,” before adding that the Pentagon's “AI will not be woke.”

Musk developed and pitched Grok as an alternative to what he called “woke AI” interactions from rival chatbots such as Google's Gemini or OpenAI's ChatGPT. In July, Grok also caused controversy after it appeared to make anti-Semitic comments that praised Adolf Hitler and shared several anti-Semitic posts.

The Pentagon did not immediately respond to questions about the issues with Grok.

Seoul quickly denied the accusation, but the development is likely to further dim prospects for its efforts to restore ties with Pyongyang.

Editor's Note: This is a developing story.

Unidentified drones struck the Russian city of Taganrog early on Jan. 13, with reports indicating that a drone manufacturing facility was targeted, according to Russian Telegram channels. 

Monitoring groups identified the targeted facility as Atlant Aero, a company that produces components for combat drones, control systems, and electronic warfare equipment.

Local channels claimed that air defense systems were engaging aerial targets, while videos circulating showed a fire at the site. 

Rostov Oblast Governor Yuriy Slyusar later confirmed the attack on Taganrog, without specifying the facility involved. 

“Air defense forces are currently repelling an aerial attack on Taganrog,"" Slyusar wrote. ""No information about civilian casualties has been received. Data on ground damage is being clarified."" 

Additional footage showing the aftermath of the strike continued to emerge later in the morning as authorities assessed the damage.

Rostov Oblast, located along the Russia-Ukraine border and adjacent to the Russian-occupied Luhansk and Donetsk Oblasts, is frequently targeted by Ukrainian strikes due to its proximity to the front line.

While Ukraine has not officially confirmed involvement in the incident, Ukrainian forces have increasingly carried out strikes inside Russian territory, aiming to degrade Russia's military and economic capacity to sustain its war against Ukraine.

Just over the past week, Russian forces launched close to 1,100 strike drones against Ukraine, as well as 890 guided aerial bombs and 50 missiles, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 11.

Ukraine's prime lithium deposit has been officially awarded to a U.S.-linked group of investors as the country courts U.S. President Donald Trump with business deals amid ongoing peace proposal talks.

The winner of the competition, launched in August 2025, is Dobra Lithium Holdings — a joint venture between TechMet, a U.S. government-backed mining firm, and The Rock Holdings, Prime Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko wrote on Telegram on Nov. 12.

The New York Times reported last week, citing anonymous Ukrainian officials, that the government was ready to approve the investment group, which also includes Trump ally Ronald S. Lauder — the man credited with the idea for the U.S. to take control over Greenland. 

For now, the specific terms of Dobra Lithium Holdings' proposal have not yet been made public. The company has simply been awarded the rights to a product-sharing agreement with the Ukrainian government, meaning profits will also be shared with the state.

Dobra Lithium Holdings told the Kyiv Independent it ""looks forward"" to the next phase of negotiations over the terms of the product-sharing agreement with the government.

""Once developed, it will make a significant contribution to the economic recovery and reconstruction of Ukraine,"" the company said.

The announcement comes as President Volodymyr Zelensky leverages Ukraine's economic potential to win over Trump's support for Kyiv's 20-point peace proposal. As part of ongoing peace talks, Kyiv also announced an $800 billion ""prosperity plan"" to attract American and European investors over the next 10 years.

TechMet was long seen as the competition's likely winner, in part due to it being backed by the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), a government agency established under Trump's first term.

Lithium is a highly in-demand mineral for its use in the AI, robotics, defense, and energy sectors. The untapped Dobra deposit, located in the central Kirovohrad Oblast, has been touted as one of Ukraine's most promising mineral sites, containing between 80 and 105 million metric tons of lithium.

If the project is successful, it could attract in total over $500 million in investments, Deputy Economy Minister Yegor Perelygin wrote on Facebook on Jan. 13.

Under the competition's terms, the winner is required to invest a minimum of $179 million in capital investments into the site, Perelygin wrote. This includes $12 million for new geological surveys and audits within 2.5 years.

If the surveys and audits show that the deposit is worthwhile for the company to commercially mine, then at least $167 million will be directed towards production and enrichment in another four to five years.

The product sharing agreement with the state lasts for up to 50 years, according to the Economy Ministry.

In the first four years of the extraction, Dobra Lithium Holdings will pay the Ukrainian government 4% of the direct share of the profits, as well as a rental fee, corporate tax, and employees' taxes, totaling 13% of the company's profits, Perelygin said.

Once Dobra Lithium Holdings is in its fifth year of lithium production, the government gets a much bigger share —  22%  — after the company recoups its initial costs.

Zelensky's administration drew attention to the deposit last year, following the signing of a minerals deal in April, and the subsequent creation of a U.S.-Ukraine reconstruction fund. The 2025 agreement gives preferential access to U.S. investors through the fund, and was jointly developed with the DFC.

""The (Dobra) project will provide an impetus for further attracting more investors,"" wrote Svyrydenko.

""Attracting investors from the U.S. and the EU also enhances international attention to Ukraine, brings in modern extraction and processing technologies, and creates additional security guarantees for our country.""

Live Updates


• Prosecutors quit: The former acting US attorney in Minneapolis and two of his top lawyers resigned amid White House pressure to focus the probe into the Immigration and Customs Enforcement-involved shooting last week of a mother on her actions and those of people around her, someone briefed on the matter said.
    


            • More feds to Minneapolis: About 1,000 more Customs and Border Protection agents are deploying as tensions flare after Renee Good's killing sparked protests nationwide.
    


            • Court fights: Democratic-led Minnesota, Minneapolis and St. Paul sued the Trump administration, calling its immigration operation “a federal invasion.” The suit doesn't aim to kick out ICE but is “because of this escalation,” the state attorney general said.
    


            • White House reaction: President Donald Trump defended ICE agents in Minnesota, saying online a “day of reckoning and retribution is coming.” Trump ramped up the enforcement push to target undocumented Somali immigrants, but like similar actions across the US, it has nabbed others and many without criminal records.
    


            Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called the resignation of federal prosecutor Joe Thompson a “huge loss for our state.”
    


                    “It's also the latest sign Trump is pushing nonpartisan career professionals out of the justice department, replacing them with his sycophants,” he said in a post on X.
                





            The governor also praised Thompson as a “principled public servant.” Thompson, who as first assistant US attorney for Minnesota, previously uncovered federal funding fraud in the state.
    


            Thompson and two other top prosecutors from the US attorney's office for Minnesota resigned after pressure from the Trump administration to investigate the woman who was killed by an ICE agent in Minneapolis.
    


            Joseph Thompson and two other top prosecutors in the office resigned after pressure from the Trump administration to focus the probe of the ICE officer shooting of Renee Good on the actions of Good and others around her, according to a person briefed on the matter.
    


            Thompson was previously the acting US attorney for Minnesota and then served as the first assistant US attorney for Minnesota.
    


            Other resignations are also possible as prosecutors weigh how to respond to pressure from their superiors in Washington.
    


            Thompson is a career prosecutor who, with Harry Jacobs, led the Justice Department's yearslong effort to tackle rampant social services fraud in Minnesota.
    


            Melinda Williams, another senior prosecutor, resigned along with Jacobs, the source said. Others are weighing whether to resign instead of following unusual demands on how to handle the shooting probe, the source said.
    


Correction: This post was updated to reflect that Thompson was not the acting US attorney for Minnesota when he resigned. 



            An aggressive crowd of people followed Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents gathered in the Powderhorn neighborhood of Minneapolis this morning as they tried to leave the area after clashes with protestors.
    


            Some of the people could be seen standing in the way as ICE agents tried to move their cars through the crowds, according to a CNN crew on the scene.
    


            The protestors could also be seen attacking the side of a least one car, throwing snowballs at agents and furiously blowing whistles.
    


            CNN's Ryan Young described the scene as “chaotic” and the people as “very angry” while reporting from the area.
    


            “This is one of the worst scenes that I've seen,” Young reported. “What you have is people going back and forth with the ICE agents and some of the ICE agents are actually responding to some of these people  who are in this crowd.”
    


            “These people are angry, they are loud and the ICE agents are sort of backing away,” Young reported as the crowd followed the ICE agents chanting “ICE Out Now, ICE Out Now!”
    


            Pepper balls were dispersed as federal agents and protestors clashed Tuesday morning in the Powderhorn neighborhood of Minneapolis. Many residents blew whistles and shouted “ICE out now,” telling agents to get out of their neighborhood.
    


            Agents had surged into the area with at least 15 different large SUVs, according to a CNN crew on the scene.
    


            As agents returned to their vehicles, flash bangs were also fired at the crowd. Some protesters were then seen throwing snowballs at the agents.
    


            Video captured by CNN at the scene shows crowds and federal agents jostling. One individual can be seen pinned to the ground by agents as others in the crowd yell on.
    


            White House Border Czar Tom Homan defended the immigration operation in Minnesota and pushed back against claims from local officials stating it was a “federal invasion” on Fox News this morning.
    


            “We'll win the lawsuits ‘cause we're simply enforcing laws that were enacted by Congress. We're not making this up,” he said, responding to the lawsuit filed yesterday by the state against the Trump administration, stating the constitutional rights of their residents are being violated.
    


                    “We're enforcing laws enacted by Congress. If these protesters don't like it, go protest Capitol Hill, because we're enforcing laws that they enacted. And we're not going to apologize for doing it,” he said.
                





            He defended ICE agents after criticisms of inadequate training came from local officials, saying the agents they hire have law enforcement backgrounds and are often previously retired ICE agents returning to the workforce.
    


            “I think the training's adequate,” he said.
    


            Although they were filed on the same day and have similar aims, the new federal lawsuits challenging Trump administration immigration surges in Minnesota and Illinois are not seeking exactly the same thing.
    


In Minnesota: In its lawsuit, the state asks a judge to “Declare that Defendants' unprecedented surge of Defendants' agents in Minnesota is unconstitutional and unlawful” and reinstate a previous policy avoiding immigration raids at schools, hospitals and houses of worship. The plaintiffs also want a judge to ban aggressive engagement techniques against suspects and protesters.
    


            Attorney General Keith Ellison told CNN's Sara Sidner the purpose is not to end all immigration enforcement in his state.
    


            “The word surge is important here,” Ellison said today.
    


In Illinois: The state's lawsuit goes further, saying the court should “enjoin Defendant CBP from conducting civil immigration enforcement in Illinois” unless there is “express Congressional authorization” to do so.
    


            While the Illinois Attorney General's Office says it wants the Trump administration “to stop using tactics that exceed their statutory authority granted by Congress,” the Supreme Court has ruled that courts must give great deference to the executive branch on how to enforce laws.
    


            As CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig noted earlier, “There is no way a judge can say, ‘You, federal law enforcement agency: You are not allowed to execute federal law in a certain state or city.'”
    


            President Donald Trump just defended ICE agents on the ground in Minnesota, calling them “patriots” whose only motivation is to remove criminal undocumented immigrants from the community.
    


            In a lengthy post on Truth Social, Trump attacked familiar political rivals and said Minnesota Democrats “love the unrest that anarchists and professional agitators are causing because it gets the spotlight off of the 19 Billion Dollars that was stolen by really bad and deranged people,” referring to fraud allegations in the state. He also said a “reckoning” was coming, as around 1,000 more US Customs and Border Protection agents are expected to deploy to Minneapolis in the wake of last week's shooting involving an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer that left a mother of three dead.
    


                    “FEAR NOT, GREAT PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA, THE DAY OF RECKONING & RETRIBUTION IS COMING!” Trump posted.
                





Remember: Minnesota and Illinois are suing the Trump administration over the immigration tactics used their states, which Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said have “terrorized our communities” and violated the Constitution.
    


            “Every place we go, crime comes down. In Chicago, despite a weak and incompetent Governor and Mayor fighting us all the way, a big improvement was made. Thousands of Criminals were removed!” Trump said.
    


            Trump did not mention in his post Renee Good, the US citizen and mother of three who was shot and killed by an ICE officer in Minneapolis. On Air Force One Sunday, Trump called Good a “very violent” and “radical” person.
    


            The Department of Homeland Security said today it is ending a form of humanitarian relief for Somali nationals living in the United States.
    


            The Trump administration has stripped deportation protections from multiple nationalities in the US that were allowed to temporarily live in the country, arguing that conditions at home no longer justified those protections. The termination of the relief, known as Temporary Protected Status, has prompted legal challenges nationwide and has been blocked by federal judges in some instances.
    


                    “Temporary means temporary. Country conditions in Somalia have improved to the point that it no longer meets the law's requirement for Temporary Protected Status. Further, allowing Somali nationals to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to our national interests. We are putting Americans first,” DHS said in a statement.
                





            Today's announcement comes as protections for Somalis were set to expire on March 17. During the Biden administration, then-Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas extended the program for the community. The department is required to decide whether to extend or terminate TPS at least 60 days prior to the designation's expiration.
    


            In November, President Donald Trump indicated that he intended to terminate protections for Somali immigrants residing in the US, claiming, “Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing. Send them back to where they came from. It's OVER!”
    


            Somalis, particularly in Minnesota, have faced harassment and threats amid a welfare-fraud scandal that ensnared the community. Nearly 58% of Somalis in Minnesota were born in the US, according to the US Census Bureau. Of the foreign-born Somalis in Minnesota, an overwhelming majority – 87% – are naturalized US citizens.
    


            TPS applies to people who would face extreme hardship if forced to return to homelands devastated by armed conflict or natural disasters, therefore so the protections are limited to people already in the United States. Past Republican and Democratic administrations have designated the protections, though some Republicans have argued the relief shouldn't have been extended multiple times.
    


Some context: Somali citizens were first granted TPS in 1991 and maintained it “due to insecurity and ongoing armed conflict,” according to an August Congressional Research Service report, which also said 705 Somali nationals were covered by TPS as of March 2025.
    


            Although Minnesota's new lawsuit asking a judge to declare the latest surge of immigration enforcement in the state “unconstitutional and unlawful,” Attorney General Keith Ellison says the purpose is not to kick agents out entirely.
    


            “We're not saying that ICE cannot have a presence in Minnesota,” Ellison told CNN's Sara Sidner on Tuesday morning. “We're saying the dramatic escalation, which is unwarranted and politically motivated, is harming our state and our cities.”
    


                    “This is not about ICE being in Minnesota. We know ICE has been in Minnesota for a long time, and we didn't sue before. We're suing now because of this escalation,” Ellison said.
                





            The morning after the lawsuit was filed, President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social: “FEAR NOT, GREAT PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA, THE DAY OF RECKONING & RETRIBUTION IS COMING!”
    


            “Well, if he's threatening retribution, I believe that he means that,” Ellison told CNN. “He's known for vengeance.”
    


            The lawsuit by Minnesota, Minneapolis and St. Paul that argues the Trump administration's widespread immigration enforcement operation is “a federal invasion of the Twin Cities” is not meant to stop federal agents from working within their legal limits, St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her told CNN on Tuesday.
    


            “This is to hold them accountable. They are terrorizing our neighborhoods and our communities, and (for) that they have to be held accountable,” Her told Kate Bolduan, adding the plaintiffs believe the Trump administration is neither complying with the Constitution and federal policies nor respecting states' rights.
    


            This “will be the precedent-setting case,” the Democratic mayor said when asked how this suit might align with prior legal claims.
    


            “This is unprecedented time. There wouldn't be any kind of case that exists already because this is the first this is happening,” Her said. “Never in any other administration has any president had this type of overreach into local jurisdictions.”
    


            While they may contain strong claims, the lawsuits filed by Illinois and Minnesota are “really political diatribes masquerading as lawsuits,” CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said.
    


            “If you look at what both states are asking the courts to do, it's to kick ICE out of those states and cities and to bar ICE from carrying on federal law enforcement in Illinois and Minnesota,” he told Kate Bolduan on CNN News Central Tuesday morning.
    


            But “there is zero precedent for that,” Honig said. “There is no way a judge can say, ‘You, federal law enforcement agency: You are not allowed to execute federal law in a certain state or city.'”
    


            The most that Illinois and Minnesota could get out of their efforts – if they get sympathetic judges – “is a judge who's going to ask questions of ICE, who's going to hold hearings, who's going to demand questions about how they're training, how they're carrying out their policy,” Honig said.
    


            “But I don't give them much of a chance of achieving the legal thing that they're asking for in the courts.”
    


            In its new lawsuit seeking an order to effectively shut down enhanced Customs and Border Protection activity in Illinois, the state is asking for the case to be heard by a familiar face.
    


            The plaintiffs say the new case should be heard by Illinois federal judge Sara Ellis – an Obama appointee – who was previously assigned to a case challenging immigration agents' response to protesters and journalists in the Chicago area last year.
    


            In that case, Ellis ordered agents to avoid using pepper balls and tear gas unless directly engaged by protesters and only after giving a clear verbal warning.
    


            Ellis expressed frustration with Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino – the leader of Operation Midway Blitz – in her order, saying he “admitted in his deposition that he lied multiple times about the events that occurred in Little Village that prompted him to throw tear gas at protesters.”
    


            That case is still technically pending, but the plaintiffs have asked for it to be dismissed because Operation Midway Blitz ended in November.
    


            Cases are typically assigned to judges within a federal district at random, but Illinois argues their new lawsuit is “related” to the previous suit on protesters, giving Ellis authority to take it. Ellis has not yet decided whether the case should be moved to her court.
    


            Minnesota's new lawsuit against the Trump administration claims Operation Metro Surge is an unconstitutional retaliation against the state for political reasons, but it also says federal agents have used “unlawful tactics” that “undermine public trust in state and local law enforcement.”
    


            Here are some of the cited examples:
    


            Around 1,000 more US Customs and Border Protection agents are expected to deploy to Minneapolis in the wake of last week's shooting involving an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer that left a mother of three dead, according to two federal law enforcement sources.
    


            The agents started deploying Friday and continued over the weekend, one of the sources said, coming on top of the deployment of about 2,000 federal agents to the area that CNN reported early last week.
    


            CBP Commander Gregory Bovino has already been on the ground with hundreds of agents and has been conducting targeted operations, including door knocks, one of the sources said. Documents provided to those who receive door knocks are either administrative warrants – signed by an immigration officer but without the same legal weight as a judicial warrant – or copies of their final orders of removal.
    


            Minnesota's lawsuit against the Trump administration, asking a federal judge to end Operation Metro Surge in the Twin Cities, is not intended to cripple the ability of ICE to carry out its duties, Attorney General Keith Ellison said Monday.
    


            “Quite honestly, we need ICE to just do what ICE is supposed to do, which is immigration enforcement,” Ellison told CNN's Laura Coates last night. “They're doing far more than that … by harassing people, by using excessive force on a routine basis.”
    


            Administration officials initially cited investigations of fraud connected to billions of dollars of federal funds centered on the area's Somali community in announcing the surge, but Ellison argues the issues aren't connected.
    


            “What we need is accountants, you know. We don't need armed paramiltaries harassing students at Roosevelt High School,” he said. “We don't need them going to grocery stores, Target stores, and throwing people to the ground.”
    


Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old US citizen, was killed when an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot into her vehicle during an encounter last week.
    


             Good crossed paths with a 10-year ICE officer and Iraq War veteran named Jonathan Ross, who was dragged about 100 yards six months prior by a driver during an immigration operation in a Minneapolis suburb.
    


            Good and Ross — whose brief confrontation  ended with him firing his weapon at least three times as she attempted to drive away — are now at the center of furious debate over President Donald Trump's administration's building immigration crackdown, each side angrily assigning blame to the other.
    


            Videos of the incident are still emerging, and there's more to be learned.
    


            Federal officials, including Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, quickly accused Good of trying to use her vehicle to kill or harm ICE agents. She called it an “act of domestic terrorism.”
    


            But Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and state officials pushed back, blasting the actions of the officers. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called the shooting “totally predictable” and “totally avoidable.”
    


            The state of Minnesota and the Twin Cities are suing the Trump administration, arguing the widespread federal immigration operation in the state is “a federal invasion of the Twin Cities,” according to a lawsuit filed yesterday.
    


            The suit is seeking a court order halting the operations, arguing the federal government is unlawfully commandeering state resources and violating Minnesota law and city ordinances.
    


            The lawsuit also claims Operation Metro Surge is not a legitimate law enforcement action, but rather a retaliation effort against Democratic-led Minnesota, citing the president's disparaging comments toward local officials.
    


                    “President Trump expressed the root of his displeasure in plain terms during a recorded interview: he essentially claimed that Minnesota is ‘corrupt' and ‘crooked' because its officials accurately reported election results and those results did not declare him the winner,” the lawsuit says, citing a January 9 interview by the president.
                





            It is the latest development in the monthslong spat between Minnesota officials and the federal government after President Donald Trump first ramped up immigration enforcement in the Minneapolis area in December.
    


More on the immigration operation: The federal government initially launched Operation Metro Surge, an immigration crackdown in the Twin Cities, to target undocumented Somali immigrants but it has also led to the arrests of immigrants from other nations.
    


“DHS law enforcement have made over 2,000 arrests since Operation Metro Surge began,” Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Monday.
    


            Nationwide outcry over the killing of a Minneapolis woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent last week spilled into the streets of cities across the US over the weekend,  with protesters demanding the removal of federal immigration authorities from their communities and justice for the slain Renee Good.
    


            In Minneapolis, snow flurries drifted down as thousands of people gathered in parks, along residential streets and outside federal buildings, chanting Good's name, whose death has become a focal point of national outrage over federal authorities' tactics in US cities while carrying out President Donald Trump's sweeping immigration crackdown.
    


            Similar protests unfolded across the US — from Los Angeles and New York to Washington, DC, El Paso and Boston. More than 1,000 demonstrations were planned across the country this weekend by the “ICE out for good” national coalition of advocacy groups.
    


            “The response to ICE's horrific killing of Renee Nicole Good is loud, peaceful, and inescapable,” coalition member group Indivisible said in a Saturday Facebook post accompanied by images of protests in multiple cities.
    


Protesters continued to take to the streets Sunday, demanding federal immigration officers be removed from their communities following the killing of Minneapolis woman Renee Good.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Tuesday that they will refuse to comply with a congressional subpoena to testify in a House committee's investigation of Jeffrey Epstein.

The Clintons, in a letter released on social media, slammed the House Oversight probe as “legally invalid” even as Republican lawmakers prepared contempt of Congress proceedings against them. The Clintons wrote that the chair of the House Oversight Committee, Republican Rep. James Comer, is on the cusp of a process “literally designed to result in our imprisonment.”

“We will forcefully defend ourselves,” wrote the Clintons, who are Democrats. They accused Comer of allowing other former officials to provide written statements about Epstein to the committee, while selectively enforcing subpoenas against them.

The intensifying clash adds another dimension to the fight over Epstein, raising new questions about the limits of congressional power to compel testimony. It also comes when Republicans are grappling with the Justice Department's delayed release of the Epstein files after a bipartisan push for their release.




Comer said he'll begin contempt of Congress proceedings next week. It potentially starts a complicated and politically messy process that Congress has rarely reached for and could result in prosecution from the Justice Department. 

“No one's accusing the Clintons of any wrongdoing. We just have questions,” Comer told reporters after Bill Clinton did not show up for a scheduled deposition at House offices Tuesday.

He added, “Anyone would admit they spent a lot of time together.”

Clinton has never been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein but had a well-documented friendship with the wealthy financier throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. Republicans have zeroed in on that relationship as they wrestle with demands for a full accounting of Epstein's wrongdoing.

Epstein was arrested in 2019 on federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges. He killed himself in a New York jail cell while awaiting trial.

“We have tried to give you the little information we have. We've done so because Mr. Epstein's crimes were horrific,” the Clintons wrote in the letter.

Multiple former presidents have voluntarily testified before Congress, but none has been compelled to do so. That history was invoked by President Donald Trump in 2022, between his first and second terms, when he faced a subpoena by the House committee investigating the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, riot by a mob of his supporters at the U.S. Capitol.

Trump's lawyers cited decades of legal precedent they said shielded an ex-president from being ordered to appear before Congress. The committee ultimately withdrew its subpoena.

Comer also indicated that the Oversight committee would not attempt to compel testimony from Trump about Epstein, saying that it could not force a sitting president to testify.

Trump, a Republican, also had a well-documented friendship with Epstein. He has said he cut off that relationship before Epstein was accused of sexual abuse.

Meanwhile, the congressional co-sponsors of legislation that forced the public release of investigative documents in the sex trafficking probe of Epstein and British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell asked a New York judge in a letter to appoint a neutral expert to oversee release of the materials. The letter, dated Jan. 8, was delivered to the judge Monday night.

U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, and Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, told U.S. District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer they had “urgent and grave concerns” that the Justice Department has failed to comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which required the files to be released last month. They said they believed “criminal violations have taken place” in the release process.

Engelmayer presides over the Maxwell case. Maxwell, a former Epstein girlfriend, is serving a 20-year prison sentence after her 2021 sex trafficking conviction for recruiting girls and women to be abused by Epstein and for sometimes joining in the abuse. Last month, Maxwell sought to set aside her conviction, saying new evidence had emerged proving constitutional violations spoiled her trial.

Justice Department officials, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday, have said the files' release was slowed by redactions required to protect the identities of abuse victims.

In their letter, Khanna and Massie wrote that the Department of Justice's release of 12,000 documents out of more than 2 million documents being reviewed was a “flagrant violation” of the law's release requirements and had caused “serious trauma to survivors.”

“Put simply, the DOJ cannot be trusted with making mandatory disclosures under the Act,” the congressmen said as they asked for the appointment of an independent monitor to ensure all documents and electronically stored information are immediately made public.

They also recommended that a court-appointed monitor be given authority to notify and prepare reports about the true nature and extent of the document production and whether improper redactions or conduct have taken place.

Engelmayer directed the Justice Department and Maxwell, if she wishes, to respond to the allegations from the congressmen by Friday.

Donald Trump's administration said Tuesday it will end temporary protected status for immigrants from Somalia, the latest move in the president's mass deportation agenda. 

The move affects hundreds of people who are a small subset of immigrants with TPS protections in the United States. It comes during Trump's immigration crackdown in Minneapolis, where many native Somalis live and where street protests have intensified since a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent killed a U.S citizen who was demonstrating against federal presence in the city.

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that affected Somalis must leave the U.S. by March 17, when existing protections, last extended by former President Joe Biden, will expire.

“Temporary means temporary,” said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, adding that the decision puts “Americans first.”

The Congressional Research Service last spring said the Somali TPS population was 705 out of nearly 1.3 million TPS immigrants. But Trump has rolled back protections across multiple countries in his second presidency. 

Congress established the Temporary Protected Status program in 1990 to help foreign nationals attempting to leave unstable, threatening conditions in their home countries. It allows the executive branch to designate a country so that its citizens are eligible to enter the U.S. and receive status. 

Somalia first received the designation under President George H.W. Bush amid a civil war in 1991. The status has been extended for decades, most recently by Biden in July 2024. 




Noem insisted circumstances in Somalia “have improved to the point that it no longer meets the law's requirement for Temporary Protected Status.”

Located in the horn of Africa, Somalia is one of the world's poorest nations and has for decades been beset by chronic strife exacerbated by multiple natural disasters, including severe droughts. 

The 2025 congressional report stated that Somalis had received more than two dozen extensions because of perpetual “insecurity and ongoing armed conflict that present serious threats to the safety of returnees.”

Trump has targeted Somali immigrants with racist rhetoric and accused those in Minneapolis of massively defrauding federal programs. 

In December, Trump said he did not want Somalis in the U.S., saying they “come from hell” and “contribute nothing.” He made no distinction between citizens and non-citizens or offered any opinion on immigration status. He has had especially harsh words for Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat who emigrated from Somalia as a child. Trump has repeatedly suggested she should be deported, despite her being a U.S. citizen, and in his rant last fall he called her “garbage.”

Omar, who has been an outspoken critic of the ICE deployment in Minneapolis, has called Trump's “obsession” with her and Somali-Americans “creepy and unhealthy.”

Jillian Balow, a former Wyoming state superintendent of public instruction, is jumping into the congressional race to succeed Rep. Harriet Hageman in the Cowboy State's at-large U.S. House district.

""Wyoming deserves a representative who understands our way of life and fights for it every day in Washington,"" Balow said, according to a press release obtained by Fox News Digital ""I am running to defend Wyoming's energy economy, protect our constitutional freedoms, support parents and students, and make sure the voices of rural communities are never ignored.""

The race is an open contest as Hageman announced a U.S. Senate bid last month after GOP Sen. Cynthia Lummis announced that she would not seek re-election.

""I am proud of the legacy Senator Cynthia Lummis and Congresswoman Harriet Hageman have built by standing up for Wyoming values and refusing to back down in Washington,"" Balow noted, according to the press release. ""They are trailblazers for our state, and I am running to carry that same strong, independent Wyoming voice forward, to follow in their footsteps, and to fight for our state with the same conviction and resolve.""

Balow will face competition in the GOP primary for the U.S. House seat from Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray and Reid Rasner, who lost a 2024 Republican U.S. Senate primary in the state to incumbent Sen. John Barasso.

One of the most interesting discoveries made during the arrest of Venezuelan strongman Nicolas Maduro in the early hours of Jan. 3 was the confirmation of something we kind of already knew: His security personnel were mostly Cuban, not Venezuelan.

In fact, Cuba is a factor behind another news headline topic. Many of the groups organizing protests against Maduro's arrest and the ICE shooting in Minneapolis also have connections to Cuba.

This Praetorian Guard around Maduro and the thugs on our streets are but the latest example of Cuba's campaign to export Marxism-Leninism throughout the Western Hemisphere, including right here in America.

This is a tale of violence, subversion, and outright terror that began when Fidel Castro's guerrillas took over Cuba on New Year's Day, 1959. It lasts to this day.

Last week, I published a paper for the Heritage Foundation that details Cuba's meddling in the lives of its neighbors. It lays out a stark reality: that while many Americans may dismiss this ideological dinosaur as toothless, thinking that no threat could come from a regime lobbing insults from a city in ruins, Havana remains a house of hatred — its crumbling architecture a testament to smoldering rage.

Cuba's communist regime had always brazenly denied that it had troops in Venezuela. Then it had no choice but to admit it on Sunday night, when it announced that 32 members of its Revolutionary Armed Forces and Ministry of Interior had been killed by American forces executing an arrest warrant on Maduro.

Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez of Cuba routinely and earnestly lied about this. In a 2019 speech in Havana, he said, “The accusation by the president of the United States that Cuba maintains a private army in Venezuela is outrageous. I challenge him to present evidence. Our government rejects this slander in the strongest and most categorical terms.”

Well, yesterday's slander is “honor and glory” today. Rodriguez and the regime's other minions are now lauding on X these 32 “heroes” who fell fighting this “criminal act of aggression and state terrorism” by the U.S.

Cuba's interference did not just lead to death and destruction but also to the military reaction we saw when coups led to military regimes throughout Latin America in the 1970s.

The corrupt and tyrannical Maduro himself became, in many ways, a prisoner of his even more sanguinary Cuban keepers. Former Mexican Foreign Minister Jorge Castañeda is one of many who believe that one of the reasons Maduro could not accept a deal to leave power after clearly fraudulent elections in 2024, or that he has not been overthrown by the military, is the thousands of Cuban operatives in the country.

This obviously raises the question of who was in charge in Caracas of some of the worst actions to destabilize the U.S. from within — the Venezuelans or their Cuban minders.

But the rise of Hugo Chavez, and after he died in 2012, of Maduro, was a later stage of Cuba's involvement in the region. The first stage of Havana's campaign to subvert elected governments in Latin America was the one that started with the victory of the revolution and ended with the military dictatorship — though, it needs to be stressed, these juntas and presidents were only temporary, lasting about a decade each, compared to the 27 years the Bolivarian experiment has lasted and Cuba's 67 years in socialist hell, which continues.

Venezuela was, in fact, the first country that Castro visited on his campaign to spread revolution. On Jan. 23, 1959, less than a month in power, he jetted off to Caracas, where he was met by the Chilean Marxist poet Pablo Neruda and, from there, began to plot how to launch class struggle, first throughout the Caribbean, then throughout Latin America.

The first target was Panama. According to a paper by Matías Jove and John Suarez published in Spain in 2025, in early 1959, “Cuban and Panamanian guerrilla troops conducted an attempted invasion of Panama with the objective of replicating the revolution that had triumphed in Cuba a few months earlier.”

Castro took a couple of years to consolidate his revolution at home. Then, in 1961 and 1962, he intervened in New York, Hartford, and Puerto Rico, whose independence had been an idee fixe going back to the 1940s. Cuban intelligence in 1961 recruited the Puerto Rican terrorist Filiberto Ojeda Rios, who went on to help found armed guerrilla groups or join existing ones.

After that came Uruguay, the “Switzerland of Latin America,” where Castro promoted the terrorist Tupamaro group, where he began funding, training, and even creating terrorist groups, and Brazil, where he started financing terrorist groups.

In 1966, Cuba hosted the giant Tricontinental Conference, whose significance is impossible to overstate. Castro brought together the most violent revolutionary groups from Asia, Africa, and Latin America and rewrote the rules of anti-Western and anti-Yanki militancy. Even Venezuela's “Carlos the Jackal,” the most infamous terrorist of the era, was in attendance.

From Tricontinental, Castro also reached out to U.S. student radicals. The conference's final declaration said that armed Third World revolution would raise “the political consciousness of the people of the United States.” They expected the emergence of “class struggle” in the U.S.

Havana was the first foreign city visited by members of the domestic terrorist group the Weather Underground after it was created in July 1969. Weathermen leader and founder Bernardine Dohrn led a large delegation to Cuba just one month after the group's founding. There, she learned directly from revolutionary leaders from the communist island, and from Vietnam, Mao Zedong's China, and North Korea, how to bring the revolution home to America.

From there, Castro went on to try to subvert Chile, Argentina, El Salvador, etc. But because Castro succeeded in installing a revolutionary government through violence in only one place, Nicaragua in 1979, he later switched tactics.

In 1990, after the Sandinistas lost an election that he had counseled against, and with the Soviet Union clearly about to fall, Castro and Brazilian Marxist leader Inacio Lula da Silva, today's president of Brazil, established the Foro de São Paulo, a regional forum of Marxist parties and individuals that pointed the way to a second approach to power.

Rather than follow Mao's old aphorism that “Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun,” the Foro would attempt to gain cultural ascendancy and then use the ballot box to win power.

The formula that emerged over the next three decades relied heavily on the teachings of Antonio Gramsci, who founded Italy's Communist Party in the 1920s and was one of the ideologues who turned Marxism into a cultural movement away from its old reliance on economics.

The idea was to infiltrate and capture national institutions and then realize cultural changes. From that point on, communists and socialists in Latin America would put down their weapons and try to get elected on “reformist” and “populist” platforms, de-emphasizing their Marxism or even concealing it.

Once elected, however, these Marxists would erect constitutional assemblies, rewrite their constitutions, and implement other changes to ensure that socialist principles would be imposed on the population.

All of this was replicated in Venezuela after Chavez, Maduro's predecessor, was elected president in late 1998 and began to institute Marxism. Chavez opened his country's ample financial spigots to finance Cuba, left without its Soviet sugar daddy, and the rest of the Foro.

Cuba and Venezuela continue to play a hand in attempts to destabilize the U.S. to this day, acting directly or through the Foro. On Oct. 8, 2023, one day after Palestinian terrorists launched an invasion of Israel and massacred 1,200 people, mostly civilians, many of them American citizens, and took hundreds of hostages, demonstrators took to Times Square in New York to hold a pro-terrorist rally.

Israel had not yet retaliated, so the demonstrators could not have been supporting the civilians of Gaza. They were marching in support of the massacre. That demonstration was organized by a Midtown Manhattan outfit called the People's Forum, which is headed by a Cuban agent named Manolo De Los Santos, a New York-residing Dominican who has been going to Cuba for indoctrination for the past two decades.

WHY TRUMP TRAINED HIS SIGHTS ON VENEZUELA

De Los Santos is again leading demonstrations in New York and elsewhere today against Maduro's arrest and the ICE killing in Minneapolis. The People's Forum hosted a rally on Wednesday, followed by a meeting with other Cuba-tied organizations, such as the ANSWER Coalition, Code Pink, and others, where they planned the 1,000 rallies held in multiple cities this weekend.

The U.S. has known of Cuba's activities inside the U.S. and the rest of the Americas for years, but it has not done much. Trump has, however, demonstrated that he is different. Now that his administration has acted decisively to arrest Maduro and extradite him to the U.S. to face justice, he has turned his gaze to the Cuban regime, the snakehead of problems in the Western Hemisphere.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton are set to appear before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee this week to further the investigation into the files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. 

The former president is scheduled for Tuesday, with his wife set for Wednesday. The committee announced last week that if the couple does not appear for their depositions that the committee will hold them in contempt of Congress. 

“The Clintons have not confirmed their appearances for their subpoenaed depositions,” a House Oversight Committee spokeswoman said in a statement. “They are obligated under the law to appear and we expect them to do so. If the Clintons do not appear for their depositions, the House Oversight Committee will initiate contempt of Congress proceedings.”

OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE THREATENS CLINTONS WITH CONTEMPT IF THEY DON'T SHOW UP FOR EPSTEIN HEARING

The committee subpoenaed the two in August 2025 after the issue surrounding Epstein heated up and plagued Washington for months. The Clintons previously had depositions set last year but delayed their testimony.

Bill Clinton has been called to testify after he had high-profile run-ins with Epstein, including 17 White House visits during the former's presidency, according to the New York Post, though less is known about Hillary Clinton's relationship with the pair. Epstein is listed as a donor of $10,000 in 1993 to the White House Historical Association in the then-first lady's documents, which discussed renovations to the White House.

Last year, former girlfriend and convicted sex offender in Epstein's trafficking scheme Ghislaine Maxwell mentioned her interactions with Bill Clinton multiple times over the course of her interview with a senior Justice Department official, during which she claimed that the former president never went to Epstein's famous island. Maxwell also added that she never saw Hillary Clinton and Epstein together.

“President Clinton was my friend, not Epstein's friend,” Maxwell told the DOJ at one point.

“He never, absolutely never went,” she later said of Bill Clinton going to the island. “And I can be sure of that because there's no way he would've gone — I don't believe there's any way that he would've gone to the island, had I not been there. Because I don't believe he had an independent friendship, if you will, with Epstein. I didn't see President Clinton being interested in Epstein. He was just a rich guy with a plane.”

Maxwell was not the only one who said there was no evidence Bill Clinton visited Epstein's island.

“You know, in the case of Bill Clinton, as far as I was aware, there was no evidence that he visited the island,” former Attorney General Bill Barr stated in a transcribed interview conducted by the committee last year. “You know, the government did not obtain any such evidence.”

The former president was among many who wrote a birthday note in a 2003 birthday card to Epstein, put together by Maxwell.

“It's reassuring isn't it, to have lasted as long, across all the years of learning and knowing, adventures and [illegible word], and also to have your childlike curiosity, the drive to make a difference and the solace of friends,” Clinton's note reads.

Epstein's pilot, who testified in Maxwell's trial, listed both Trump and Clinton on the list of those who flew on his private plane, adding that he would be given a notice if high-profile people were flying.

Clinton spokesman Angel Urena then admitted to the former president being aboard the plane but claimed he knew nothing about the crimes being committed.

“In 2002 and 2003, President Clinton took a total of four trips on Jeffrey Epstein's airplane: one to Europe, one to Asia, and two to Africa, which included stops in connection with the work of the Clinton Foundation,” Urena wrote in 2019.

A 2002 photo surfaced, just about a year after the former president left office, of him receiving a massage from an Epstein accuser getting off a long flight to Africa, on the sex offender's plane. Clinton received the massage from then-22-year-old Chauntae Davies, who served as Epstein's personal masseuse.

Davies told the Daily Mail of the interaction, “Although the image looks bizarre, President Clinton was a perfect gentleman during the trip, and I saw absolutely no foul play involving him.” She has come forward as a victim of Epstein's, saying she was repeatedly raped.

The Washington Examiner reached out to the Clintons for comment. 

Hillary Clinton's run-ins have been less high-profile.

From 2007 to 2008, Maxwell's nephew, Alexander Djerassi, worked on Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign as a policy associate. Djerassi also served under the former secretary of state as chief of staff in the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs. Following his tenure as chief of staff, he was brought back on in 2016 to work on the transition team as Hillary Clinton was the Democratic presidential nominee, before Trump defeated her in 2016.

In 2010, Maxwell attended Chelsea Clinton's wedding, a year after sexual abuse accusations against her emerged. The former associate confirmed her attendance in her interview with the senior DOJ official. She claimed she attended with her then-boyfriend Ted Waitt, who was a friend of Bill Clinton.

In 2013, Maxwell was honored for her ocean conservation work by the Clinton Global Initiative, two years after Bill Clinton's staff recommended banning her from events.

As part of the investigation, the committee has released multiple batches of documents related to the DOJ files, many of which came from the committee's subpoena to Epstein's estate.

HOUSE ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE TO MARK UP BILL BANNING CONGRESSIONAL STOCK TRADING 

The investigation has continued despite the House forcing a vote on a full release of the files, leading to the bill being signed into law. While the Justice Department has released rounds of the files, some have pushed back, saying they have not complied with the law.

Reps. Ro Khanna (D-CA) and Thomas Massie (R-KY), who led the bill to release the files, called on a federal judge to appoint a special master to oversee the DOJ's release of files last week. ","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Major studies on microplastics are now being called into question.

This story originally appeared in The Guardian as an exclusive and is republished here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. 

High-profile studies reporting the presence of microplastics throughout the human body have been thrown into doubt by scientists who say the discoveries are probably the result of contamination and false positives. One chemist called the concerns “a bombshell.”

Studies claiming to have revealed micro and nanoplastics in the brain, testes, placentas, arteries and elsewhere were reported by media across the world, including The Guardian. There is no doubt that plastic pollution of the natural world is ubiquitous and present in the food and drink we consume and the air we breathe. But the health damage potentially caused by microplastics and the chemicals they contain is unclear, and an explosion of research has taken off in this area in recent years.

However, micro- and nanoplastic particles are tiny and at the limit of today's analytical techniques, especially in human tissue. There is no suggestion of malpractice, but researchers told The Guardian of their concern that the race to publish results, in some cases by groups with limited analytical expertise, has led to rushed results and routine scientific checks sometimes being overlooked.

The Guardian has identified seven studies that have been challenged by researchers publishing criticism in the respective journals, while a recent analysis listed 18 studies that it said had not considered that some human tissue can produce measurements easily confused with the signal given by common plastics.

There is an increasing international focus on the need to control plastic pollution but faulty evidence on the level of microplastics in humans could lead to misguided regulations and policies, which is dangerous, researchers say. It could also help lobbyists for the plastics industry to dismiss real concerns by claiming they are unfounded.

While researchers say analytical techniques are improving rapidly, the doubts over recent high-profile studies also raise the questions of what is really known today and how concerned people should be about microplastics in their bodies.

“Levels of microplastics in human brains may be rapidly rising” was the shocking headline reporting a widely covered study in February. The analysis, published in a top-tier journal and covered by The Guardian, said there was a rising trend in micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) in brain tissue from dozens of postmortems carried out between 1997 and 2024.

However, by November, the study had been challenged by a group of scientists with the publication of a “Matters arising” letter in the journal. In the formal, diplomatic language of scientific publishing, the scientists said: “The study as reported appears to face methodological challenges, such as limited contamination controls and lack of validation steps, which may affect the reliability of the reported concentrations.”

One of the team behind the letter was blunt. “The brain microplastic paper is a joke,” said Dušan Materić, at the Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research in Germany. “Fat is known to make false-positives for polyethylene. The brain has [approximately] 60 percent fat.” Materić and his colleagues suggested rising obesity levels could be an alternative explanation for the trend reported in the study.

A newsletter for anyone trying to make sense of their health.

“That paper is really bad, and it is very explainable why it is wrong,” Materić said. He thinks there are serious doubts over “more than half of the very high impact papers” reporting microplastics in biological tissue.

Professor Matthew Campen, senior author of the brain study in question, told The Guardian: “In general, we simply find ourselves in an early period of trying to understand the potential human health impacts of MNPs and there is no recipe book for how to do this. Most of the criticism aimed at the body of work to date (ie from our lab and others) has been conjectural and not buffeted by actual data.

“We have acknowledged the numerous opportunities for improvement and refinement and are trying to spend our finite resources in generating better assays and data, rather than continually engaging in a dialogue.”

But the brain study is far from alone in having been challenged. One, which reported that patients with MNPs detected in carotid artery plaques had a higher risk of heart attacks and strokes than patients with no MNPs detected, was subsequently criticized for not testing blank samples taken in the operating room. Blank samples are a way of measuring how much background contamination may be present.

Another study reported MNPs in human testes, “highlighting the pervasive presence of microplastics in the male reproductive system.” But other scientists took a different view: “It is our opinion that the analytical approach used is not robust enough to support these claims.”

This study was by Campen and colleagues, who responded: “To steal/modify a sentiment from the television show Ted Lasso, ‘[Bioanalytical assays] are never going to be perfect. The best we can do is to keep asking for help and accepting it when you can and if you keep on doing that, you'll always be moving toward better.'”

Further challenged studies include two reporting plastic particles in blood — in both cases the researchers contested the criticisms — and another on their detection in arteries. A study claiming to have detected 10,000 nanoplastic particles per liter of bottled water was called “fundamentally unreliable” by critics, a charge disputed by the scientists.

The doubts amount to a “bombshell,” according to Roger Kuhlman, a chemist formerly at the Dow Chemical Company. “This is really forcing us to reevaluate everything we think we know about microplastics in the body. Which, it turns out, is really not very much. Many researchers are making extraordinary claims, but not providing even ordinary evidence.”

While analytical chemistry has long-established guidelines on how to accurately analyse samples, these do not yet exist specifically for MNPs, said Frederic Béen, at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. “But we still see quite a lot of papers where very standard good laboratory practices that should be followed have not necessarily been followed,” Béen said.

These include measures to exclude background contamination, blanks, repeating measurements and testing equipment with samples spiked with a known amount of MNPs. “So you cannot be assured that whatever you have found is not fully or partially derived from some of these issues,” Béen said.

A key way of measuring the mass of MNPs in a sample is, perhaps counterintuitively, vaporising it, then capturing the fumes. But this method, dubbed Py-GC-MS, has come under particular criticism. “[It] is not currently a suitable technique for identifying polyethylene or PVC due to persistent interferences,” concluded a January 2025 study led by Cassandra Rauert, an environmental chemist at the University of Queensland in Australia.

“I do think it is a problem in the entire field,” Rauert told The Guardian. “I think a lot of the concentrations [of MNPs] that are being reported are completely unrealistic.”

“This isn't a dig at [other scientists],” she added. “They use these techniques because we haven't got anything better available to us. But a lot of studies that we've seen coming out use the technique without really fully understanding the data that it's giving you.” She said the failure to employ normal quality control checks was “a bit crazy”.

Py-GC-MS begins by pyrolysing the sample — heating it until it vaporizes. The fumes are then passed through the tubes of a gas chromatograph, which separates smaller molecules from large ones. Last, a mass spectrometer uses the weights of different molecules to identify them.

The problem is that some small molecules in the fumes derived from polyethylene and PVC can also be produced from fats in human tissue. Human samples are “digested” with chemicals to remove tissue before analysis, but if some remains the result can be false positives for MNPs. Rauert's paper lists 18 studies that did not include consideration of the risk of such false positives.

Rauert also argues that studies reporting high levels of MNPs in organs are simply hard to believe. “I have not seen evidence that particles between 3 and 30 micrometers can cross into the blood stream,” she said. “From what we know about actual exposure in our everyday lives, it is not biologically plausible that that mass of plastic would actually end up in these organs.”

“It's really the nano-size plastic particles that can cross biological barriers and that we are expecting inside humans,” she said. “But the current instruments we have cannot detect nano-size particles.”

Further criticism came in July, in a review study in the Deutsches Ärzteblatt, the journal of the German Medical Association. “At present, there is hardly any reliable information available on the actual distribution of microplastics in the body,” the scientists wrote.

Plastic production has ballooned by 200 times since the 1950s and is set to almost triple again to more than a billion tonnes a year by 2060. As a result, plastic pollution has also soared, with 8 billion tonnes now contaminating the planet from the top of Mount Everest to the deepest ocean trench. Less than 10 percent of plastic is recycled.

An expert review published in The Lancet in August called plastics a “grave, growing and underrecognized danger” to human and planetary health. It cited harm from the extraction of the fossil fuels they are made from, to their production, use and disposal, which result in air pollution and exposure to toxic chemicals.

In recent years, the infiltration of the body with MNPs has become a serious concern, and a landmark study in 2022 first reported detection in human blood. That study is one of the 18 listed in Rauert's paper and was criticized by Kuhlman.

But the study's senior author, Marja Lamoree, a professor at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, rejected suggestions of contamination. “The reason we focused on blood in the first place is that you can take blood samples freshly, without the interference of any plastics or exposure to the air,” she said.

“I'm convinced we detected microplastics,” she said. “But I've always said that [the amount estimated] could be maybe twice lower, or 10 times higher.” In response to Kuhlman's letter, Lamoree and colleagues said he had “incorrectly interpreted” the data.

Lamoree does agree there is a wider issue. “It's still a super-immature field and there's not many labs that can do [these analyses well],” Lamoree said. “When it comes to solid tissue samples tissues, then the difficulty is they are usually taken in an operating theatre that's full of plastic.”

“I think most of the, let's say, lesser quality analytical papers come from groups that are medical doctors or metabolomics [scientists] and they're not driven by analytical chemistry knowledge,” she said.

Improving the quality of MNP measurements in the human body matters, the scientists said. Poor quality evidence is “irresponsible” and can lead to scaremongering, Rauert said. “We want to be able to get the data right so that we can properly inform our health agencies, our governments, the general population and make sure that the right regulations and policies are put in place,” Rauert said.

“We get a lot of people contacting us, very worried about how much plastics are in their bodies,” she said. “The responsibility [for scientists] is to report robust science so you are not unnecessarily scaring the general population.”

Rauert called treatments claiming to clean microplastics from your blood “crazy” — some are advertised for 10,000 pounds. “These claims have no scientific evidence,” she said, and could put more plastic into people's blood, depending on the equipment used.

“We do have plastics in us — I think that is safe to assume. But real hard proof on how much is yet to come.”

Materić said insufficiently robust studies might also help lobbyists for the plastics industry downplay known risks of plastic pollution.

The good news, Béen said, is that analytical work across multiple techniques is improving rapidly. “I think there is less and less doubt about the fact that MNPs are there in tissues,” Béen said. “The challenge is still knowing exactly how many or how much. But I think we're narrowing down this uncertainty more and more.”

Lamoree said: “I really think we should collaborate on a much nicer basis — with much more open communication — and don't try to burn down other people's results. We should all move forward instead of fighting each other.”

In the meantime, should the public be worried about MNPs in their bodies?

Given the very limited evidence, Lamoree said she could not say how concerned people should be. “But for sure I take some precautions myself, to be on the safe side,” Lamoree said. “I really try to use less plastic materials, especially when cooking or heating food or drinking from plastic bottles. The other thing I do is ventilate my house.”

“We do have plastics in us — I think that is safe to assume,” Materić said. “But real hard proof on how much is yet to come. There are also very easy things that you can do to hugely reduce intake of MNPs. If you are concerned about water, just filtering through charcoal works.” Experts also advise avoiding food or drink that has been heated in plastic containers.

Rauert thinks that most of the MNPs that people ingest or breath in probably expelled by their bodies, but said it can't hurt to reduce your plastics exposure. Furthermore, she said, it remains vital to resolve the uncertainty over what MNPs are doing to our health. “We know we're being exposed, so we definitely want to know what happens after that and we'll keep working at it, that's for sure,” Rauert said.

Big Law has a complicated relationship with artificial intelligence. The tools that make lawyers more efficient could result in fewer billable hours.

Nick Fleisher learned that the hard way at McKinsey, where he helped elite law firms roll out tech tools, often with little enthusiasm from the lawyers expected to use them.

""It was like pulling teeth,"" Fleisher said.

That work led Fleisher to leave McKinsey and start a company in August. His startup, Sandstone, is aimed squarely at in-house legal teams instead of law firms, and Sequoia Capital is backing the idea.

The Brooklyn-based startup has raised $10 million in a seed funding round led by Sequoia Capital, Business Insider has learned. Backers include Kearny Jackson, SV Angel, the Chainsmokers' Mantis VC, Daybreak Ventures, and a group of corporate general counsels from companies including eBay and Bilt.

Sandstone uses AI to help lawyers inside companies draft and review contracts based on how they've handled similar agreements in the past.

McKinsey hired Fleisher out of the Wharton School. He landed on a team advising major law firms and worked closely with QuantumBlack, the firm's AI unit, including on a project with the American Arbitration Association to develop an ""AI arbitrator"" for construction disputes.

In his final months at McKinsey last year, Fleisher ran dozens of workshops for general counsels who, he said, couldn't justify a full McKinsey engagement but wanted enough context to build their own tech strategies.

Fleisher said many in-house teams were still wrestling with the basics: whether they were using their contract lifecycle management software correctly, how they tracked outside legal spend, and where their data actually lived.

He was struck by how quickly that posture began to change. Increasingly, Fleisher said, general counsels told him they had a mandate from the CEO or board to adopt AI — even before there was clarity on how it would affect costs or head count.

While off-duty at McKinsey, Fleisher teamed up with a colleague, Jarryd Strydom, a former technology lawyer who also codes, to build a task tracker for lawyers. They shared it with a handful of in-house lawyer friends, who began using it, helping validate the idea. The pair pitched Sequoia on their last day at McKinsey.

Sandstone has several dozen paying customers, mostly midsize companies that have several lawyers on staff. Software companies make up a large share of its user base, Fleisher said, though the company also works with clients in manufacturing, finance, logistics, and insurance.

Sandstone's pitch isn't new. Harvey got its start selling tools to elite law firms and has since expanded into large enterprises. Clio, a platform for managing cases, built a legacy serving small law firms and is now pushing into the enterprise with a new division aimed at in-house teams. A growing crop of startups is developing tools to crank out contracts and scan the ones that land in the legal inbox.

What Fleisher says was missing was a system of record for corporate legal teams: a single place to conduct legal work, pull in context from systems like email and Salesforce, and track what the legal team is actually doing day-to-day.

""There's no platform that in-house lawyers think of as their core operating system,"" Fleisher said. ""We can be that home.""

Sandstone is built for lawyers, but it's designed to handle the constant knocks on their door from the rest of the company. A salesperson can drop a draft agreement into Slack and have Sandstone review it. Fleisher says the system compares the contract against the company's past deals, house style, and sales call notes sitting in Salesforce — then flags risks and suggests edits before routing the draft to the right lawyer for approval.

If successful, Fleisher said, Sandstone could help lawyers spend less time sorting requests and more time weighing the calls that actually need a human decision.

Bogomil Balkansky, a Sequoia partner, was first introduced to Fleisher through the firm's talent team, which flagged the consultant as someone to keep close. Initially, Balkansky tried to recruit Fleisher to help run a portfolio company.

After several meetings, Fleisher told Balkansky he wanted to start his own legal tech company instead. Sequoia decided to lead Sandstone's seed round.

The bet comes as investor interest in legal tech is accelerating. Funding in the sector nearly doubled last year, rising from $2.2 billion in 2024 to $4 billion in 2025, according to Crunchbase. More than a third of that funding flowed into just three companies: Harvey, Clio, and Filevine, a system for managing legal work.

Sequoia backed Harvey at an early stage and last year led a seed round for Crosby, a startup that combines software with lawyers to handle contracts for early-stage companies. Asked about investing in companies that could eventually compete, Balkansky said Sequoia's criterion comes down to whether a market is big enough to support multiple winners.

""AI is transforming human labor into software,"" Balkansky said, and the legal industry is especially ripe for change. There are more than a million lawyers in the US, many of them among the most expensive professionals companies hire.

Fleisher's bet is that the place legal AI sticks isn't where lawyers bill by the hour, but where they're measured by how fast the business moves.

Bitcoin has reclaimed $93,000 for the first time in nearly a week, rising more than 2% in the past 24 hours.

Earlier this morning, the U.S. reported that consumer prices rose 0.3% in December. In the past year, consumer prices have risen 2.7%, according to the new data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, with the rate remaining steady from the previous month.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin was changing hands for $93,406, according to crypto price aggregator CoinGecko. Volume in the past day has increased substantially, climbing 20% to $88.9 billion, according to on-chain analytics platform CoinGlass.

Users on Myriad, a prediction market platform owned by Decrypt parent company Dastan, are as optimistic as they've ever been that Bitcoin will regain $100,000. The prediction market, which was published in late November, now shows an 80% probability that BTC will keep climbing to six figures rather than fall back to $69,000.

Trading volume for Bitcoin has returned, but it's not necessarily a sign that investors are expecting a big surge, wrote Glassnode analysts in a report Monday.

""Trading volume has rebounded modestly from cycle lows, pointing to early signs of liquidity rebuilding,"" the analysts wrote, ""however spot CVD has deteriorated, signaling rising sell-side dominance and a more defensive near-term posture.""

CVD refers to the cumulative volume delta, which tracks whether buyers or seller are being more aggressive over time. When BTC buyers dominate, CVD rises; and when sellers dominate, the metric falls.

So even though volume has been on the rise, trader sentiment hasn't risen with it. For example, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has improved slightly from Extreme Fear a month ago, but was still at a Fear rating on Tuesday.

Analysts at Singapore-based digital asset manager QCP Capital flagged that after Tuesday morning's Consumer Price Index reading, investors will now look to see how the U.S. Supreme Court rules on President Donald Trump's tariff policies.

The court has been asked to decide whether the president's trade policies are illegal and could issue a decision as soon as Wednesday. In the past, Trump's tariff announcements have set of waves of volatility for equities and crypto markets.

Regardless of how the court rules, it ""could further influence cross-asset positioning and risk sentiment,"" the QCP analysts wrote.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitmine bought $88M in ETH at $3,200 and now holds 4.17M ETH (3.45% of circulating supply). Tom Lee's supercycle thesis hinges on Ethereum transitioning from speculative asset to productive infrastructure—similar to how Bitcoin evolved from curiosity to institutional allocation.

Lee projects Bitmine's staking income could reach $374M annually once MAVAN launches in early 2026.

ETH reaching $32,000 (10x) would require a $3.8T market cap larger than Apple's current valuation.

Investors rethink ‘hands off' investing and decide to start making real money

Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) enters 2026 under intense institutional spotlight, and Tom Lee believes a supercycle is unfolding. The Fundstrat co-founder and Bitmine chairman has made increasingly aggressive Ethereum price predictions, ranging from $7,000-$9,000 near-term to as high as $60,000 over the long haul.

Lee's firm recently added $88 million in ETH at roughly $3,200 per token, pushing Bitmine's total holdings past 4.17 million ETH—about 3.45% of Ethereum's circulating supply. Lee frames the purchase as a bet on infrastructure—not speculation. With staking yields, network fees, and Layer-2 scaling driving recurring demand, he argues Ethereum could deliver a 100x return from current levels, mirroring Bitcoin's trajectory since Fundstrat first recommended it in 2017.

Lee frames the Ethereum supercycle as a multi-year adoption wave driven by institutions rather than retail speculation. In his view, the Ethereum supercycle marks a shift where traditional finance, regulation, and blockchain infrastructure begin moving in the same direction. That alignment didn't exist in earlier cycles, which were shorter and more sentiment-driven.

The comparison to Bitcoin's 2017-2021 run is deliberate but limited. Bitcoin gained traction as a store of value once institutions found a clear narrative and access points. Ethereum's path is different—its value comes from daily use. It settles stablecoins, supports lending markets, and underpins tokenized assets that institutions already interact with.

""We believe ETH is embarking on that same Supercycle,"" Lee said in November 2025. The distinction is central to his thesis: Ethereum is growing less like a trade and more like infrastructure, with demand tied to activity rather than headlines.

Bitmine's $88 million purchase wasn't about timing the bottom. Lee has been explicit that accumulating during year-end tax-loss selling reflects a structural view, not a short-term price call. The firm now holds over 4.17 million ETH—approximately 3.45% of Ethereum's circulating supply—with ambitions to reach 5%.

The scale positions Bitmine well ahead of competitors like SharpLink and The Ether Machine. Backing from Peter Thiel's Founders Fund and Cathie Wood's ARK Invest signals institutional confidence in the strategy. Lee describes Bitmine as ""the largest fresh money buyer of Ethereum in the world.""

Staking drives economic logic. Bitmine currently has over 1.25 million ETH staked, generating an estimated $93-100 million annually at current yields. Once the firm's MAVAN validator network launches in early 2026, Lee projects staking income could reach $374 million per year—over $1 million daily. At $3,200 per ETH, that represents recurring cash flow, not just price speculation.

Ten times current prices would put Ethereum at $32,000—implying a market cap near $3.8 trillion. That's larger than Apple's current valuation. Getting there requires multiple conditions aligning simultaneously.

Stablecoin expansion is the clearest driver. If supply grows from roughly $200 billion toward the $2 trillion level projected by policymakers, Ethereum captures meaningful settlement activity. Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick projects ETH reaching $7,500 in 2026, $30,000 by 2029, and $40,000 by 2030—suggesting 10x returns are achievable within a four-year window.

Lee's own targets exceed even those forecasts. At Binance Blockchain Week in December 2025, he called ETH at $3,000 ""severely undervalued"" and has floated $60,000 as a bull case driven by real-world asset tokenization. His most aggressive prediction: $250,000 long-term, implying 78x returns from current levels.

For context, ETH reaching $32,000 would require consistent institutional ETF inflows sustaining through multiple years, tokenized money market funds expanding Ethereum's role as settlement infrastructure, and Layer-2 scaling continuing without competitive displacement from Solana or other alternatives.

Ethereum's advantages remain structural. The network hosts over $50 billion in total value locked across DeFi protocols, dwarfing competitors. Layer-2 networks like Arbitrum and Optimism scale transaction throughput while keeping settlement on mainnet.

Institutional adoption continues expanding. BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) holds $11.1 billion with $190 million daily trading volume—the deepest liquidity among Ethereum ETFs. This infrastructure enables large-position entry and exit for pension funds and sovereign wealth entities.

EIP-1559's fee-burning mechanism creates deflationary pressure during high-usage periods. When activity rises, more ETH gets permanently removed while staking locks additional supply. This links adoption directly to scarcity.

Skeptics have ammunition. Fundstrat's internal 2026 outlook, written by analyst Sean Farrell, warned clients to expect a ""meaningful drawdown"" in H1 2026, with ETH potentially falling to $1,800-$2,000 before recovering. The firm's year-end 2026 target sits at $4,500—far below Lee's public rhetoric.

Lee's track record invites scrutiny. He predicted Bitcoin at $100,000 in 2021 (it finished around $51,000) and $200,000 in 2022 (it ended near $16,000). His $12,000-$15,000 ETH targets for late 2025 also missed. Bold calls generate attention, but they don't always generate returns.

Bitmine's stock price adds another complication. Shares have fallen over 50% since September even as ETH holdings appreciated, raising questions about whether treasury strategies translate into shareholder value. Critics like Eurointelligence's Wolfgang Münchau called borrowing to buy volatile assets ""downright stupid.""

Yet Lee's core thesis doesn't require perfection. Ethereum generates fees, supports stablecoin settlement at scale, and anchors tokenized assets institutions actively use. That provides downside support newer chains lack. The October 2025 liquidation event wiped $19 billion in positions—Lee frames this as the leverage reset enabling 2026 recovery.

The path to 10x depends on verifiable milestones: sustained ETF inflows above $300 million monthly, Bitmine's staking deployment materializing projected yields, and stablecoin expansion continuing without regulatory disruption.

For more than a decade, the investing advice aimed at everyday Americans followed a familiar script: automate everything, keep costs low, and don't touch a thing. And increasingly, investors are realizing that being completely hands-off also means being completely disengaged.

That realization hits like a lightning bolt when you realize not just how much better your returns could be, but that there are amazing offers like one app where new self-directed investing accounts funded with as little as $50 can receive stock worth up to $1,000.

Key Takeaways

Crypto investment products recorded $454 million in net outflows in the second week of January, interrupting the bullish momentum that marked the start of 2026.

The pullback followed a shift in macroeconomic expectations, as recent data reduced the likelihood of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in March.

That change in outlook prompted investors to scale back exposure to risk assets, including digital assets.

Bitcoin (BTC) accounted for the largest share of withdrawals, with $405 million exiting crypto investment products over the week.

Adding to the mixed sentiment, short-Bitcoin products also saw $9.2 million in outflows, suggesting that some investors unwound bearish positions alongside long exposure.

Ethereum (ETH) followed with $116 million in outflows, while multi-asset crypto products recorded $21 million in withdrawals.

Together, these figures point to broad caution toward established digital assets amid renewed market uncertainty.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominated the outflows, several altcoins moved in the opposite direction.

XRP led inflows with $45.8 million, followed by Solana (SOL) at $32.8 million and Sui (SUI) at $7.6 million.

The divergence suggests that some investors are rotating capital away from large-cap assets toward projects perceived to have stronger momentum or near-term catalysts. 

This split between outflows from core assets and inflows into select altcoins highlights a more nuanced market dynamic, where overall risk aversion coexists with targeted positioning.

The pattern may point to early-stage rotation rather than a broad exit from the asset class.

According to CoinShares , total weekly outflows reached $454 million after an initially strong start to the year.

In the first two trading days of 2026, crypto funds recorded $1.5 billion in inflows, but those gains were largely erased by $1.3 billion in outflows over the following four days.

The reversal underscores how quickly sentiment shifted in response to macroeconomic data and interest rate expectations.

Regionally, the United States accounted for the bulk of the selling, with $569 million in outflows. Those withdrawals alone pushed global flows into negative territory.

Outside the U.S., investor behavior was more resilient.

Germany posted inflows of $58.9 million, Canada recorded $24.5 million, and Switzerland saw $21 million enter crypto investment products.

The regional disparity suggests U.S. investors reacted more sharply to domestic economic signals.

International markets, however, maintained a steadier outlook, possibly supported by different regulatory conditions.

Overall, last week's flows reflect a market recalibrating expectations rather than abandoning crypto altogether, with capital selectively repositioning across regions and tokens.

The UK government has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), setting standards and expectations for the protection of citizen data.

The ICO is the independent regulatory body responsible for national data protection and reports directly to parliament. 

The MOU consists of 17 commitments and aligns with the government's plan to use technology to digitally transform public services. According to the agreement , the parties are expected to work towards a shared vision to ensure citizens see “real benefits in sharing their data” and that public trust is preserved.

According to the document, the ICO will support government's ambition to “create a modern digital government and drive economic growth”. It warned however that this would rely on the public having “confidence that their data is being used safely, for the public good and within the law”.

Innovation 2026 – register nowCo-hosted by the UK Government, UK Civil Service and the Cabinet Office, Innovation is a unique exhibition and conference that brings together government leaders from across the globe responsible for the transformation and acceleration of their public sector organisations and services.2026's exciting content line-up includes riveting panel discussions, exclusive roundtables and an innovative exhibition floor, and reflects the areas that governments around the world are prioritising – and where they are working to drive transformation.Find out more about the agenda and register to attend here

The ICO has agreed to produce “timely and relevant guidance, codes of practice, advice notes, opinions, and audits that support the government and the public sector to use people's data safely”. It also said it would be “transparent” with the public on holding organisations to account for any future breaches and would “share insights [with government] on any trends and potential risks that the ICO has seen in its work”.

Among the government's commitments is a pledge to release an “annual assurance statement” on how people's data is being kept safe and how “new and proposed technologies and processes have been designed with trust and privacy in mind”.

The government also pledged to prioritise public trust in its handling of personal data by “investing the appropriate resources and time needed to continue to create a culture of high standards and compliance”. Ministers and senior officials will be among those expected to take a lead on strengthening a culture of data security.

This will entail creating what the MOU describes as a “a cross-government culture of continuous learning around improving information security”, including “gathering intelligence and learning lessons from personal data breaches and ‘near misses'”.

In addition, the government has committed to informing “civil servants of the real-world consequences of inadvertent personal data breaches by developing and delivering ongoing and engaging communication campaigns”.

The MOU was signed on 9 January, but the intention to formalise an agreement was first announced in October last year by information commissioner John Edwards.

Edwards said then that the agreement would ensure that government's plans to use new technologies to transform public services would be carried out “with the appropriate safeguards in place”.

Meanwhile, the government is taking additional steps to make online public services more secure and resilient.

On 6 January it published the Government Cyber Action Plan, which sets out how it plans to strengthen cyber defences and digital resilience across departments and the wider public sector. It is backed by £210m (US$155m).  

Aims include achieving a “clearer visibility of risks”, “strongercentral action on the toughest challenges”, and “reacting quickly to fast-moving cyber threats and vulnerabilities”.

Ian Murray, the minister of state for the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, said in the foreword to the plan: “Hostile states and criminal groups are actively probing our defences, seeking to disrupt our way of life and undermine our national interest.We must be clear eyed about what is at stake.” 

The plan outlines how government will take what it called “proactive, risk-led action with clear accountability, mandatory requirements, and comprehensive central support” to strengthen public sector infrastructure.Steered by a new agency, the Government Cyber Unit, the plan correlates with the UK government's work to digitise public services so that “phone queues and paperwork” no longer obstruct citizens' access to support.  The government envisages that this digitisation could unlock up to £45bn [US$60.6bn] in productivity savings.

Pentagon Reportedly Testing Radio Wave Device Linked to ‘Havana Syndrome'

This reported machine may be linked to “Havana syndrome,” a debated condition characterized by a strange panoply of symptoms that were experienced by U.S. officials stationed in Cuba

Ten years ago U.S. officials stationed in Cuba started reporting a strange collection of symptoms, from ringing ears and dizziness to crushing headaches and memory loss. The symptoms, collectively dubbed “Havana syndrome” and more formally known as anomalous health incidents (AHIs), suggested a neurological issue. But what, exactly, the root cause was has remained a matter of intense debate among both medical and military experts.

Now, according to CNN, the U.S. Department of Defense has reportedly been testing a machine that is believed to produce pulsed radio waves and may be linked to Havana syndrome. The DOD and the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A device that could produce powerful pulsed radio waves is among the many speculated but unproven causes of Havana syndrome, which also include possible exposure to neurotoxins and mass psychogenic illness (collective anxiety).

Medical experts continue to debate even the specific neurological consequences of Havana syndrome: researchers at the National Institutes of Health and their colleagues performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans on 81 federal workers and their family members who said that they had heard a noise and felt pressure in their head and then developed headaches and other cognitive symptoms. The results, published in 2024 in JAMA, showed no differences between the brains of these individuals and those of a control group. Other studies have also found inconclusive results.

“It is possible that individuals with an [anomalous health incident] may be experiencing the results of an event that led to their symptoms, but the injury did not produce the long-term neuroimaging changes that are typically observed after severe trauma or stroke. We hope these results will alleviate concerns about AHI being associated with severe neurodegenerative changes in the brain,” said Carlo Pierpaoli, lead author of the NIH study, in a statement at the time.

These Vertical Solar Panels Survive Storms by ‘Swaying' Like Trees

Traditional solar fails in the windswept north. Two Swedish inventors are betting on aerodynamic resilience to solve the latitude gap

By Deni Ellis Béchard edited by Eric Sullivan

Vertical solar trackers work better the closer you get to the poles—in theory. But before Vaja, they were too fragile to withstand harsh winds.

Andréas Lennartsson

When the 47th solar panel exploded, Henrik Eskilsson began to fear he'd signed on with a madman.

In his SUV, he and Anders Olsson were accelerating across Sweden's Lunda Airfield, towing a trailer fitted with a steel mast that suspended the panel. As they gained speed, the panel did something unusual: it floated, catching the wind like a hang glider while staying anchored to the mast. The speedometer crept toward 100 kilometers per hour. Behind them, the device began vibrating. Suddenly, it snapped free, tumbled through the air and shattered on the runway.

Eskilsson, who'd previously founded a company that makes eye-tracking software, stopped the car and contemplated why he'd committed to this quixotic project: to revolutionize solar power for more than half of the people living on Earth. Many areas in the Northern Hemisphere and some in the Southern lie in zones where traditional solar fields are inefficient, especially in winter—but also in the morning and evening. When the sun sits low, its rays hit horizontal panels at a shallow, grazing angle, delivering little energy. Vertical solar panels that track the sun even as it barely clears the tree line have proved too expensive, requiring multiple motors to rotate them, too much concrete to anchor them, and too much steel to keep the wind from tearing them apart.

The shattered prototype was part of Olsson and Eskilsson's effort to solve this: Vaja, the vertical-tracking start-up they had co-founded in 2023. For years, Olsson had envisioned building solar systems that moved with the wind like leaves in a storm. He and Eskilsson had consulted with mechanical engineers, who said this design would be impossible. Olsson disagreed. Eskilsson trusted him, although he wondered how many more panels would first have to be destroyed.

They got out of the SUV, took brooms from the back and, in the brisk winter afternoon, began sweeping the runway.

Solar is the fastest-growing source of global electricity, accounting for 7 percent of the world's generation in 2024, up from roughly 1 percent a decade earlier. In the 2010s, utility companies invested heavily in solar farms with fixed-tilt panels—stationary solar arrays oriented toward the equator to catch the sun's light. Such systems produce the most electricity in the middle of the day. In markets with many solar farms, this is when electricity prices are lowest, making the panels less profitable. Then, as the sun goes down and electricity demand spikes, the panels cease to be productive.

Horizontal trackers address such limitations by following the sun. Mounted on a north-south spine, the panels tilt like a seesaw, turning east at dawn, lying flat at midday and facing west at sunset. They can deliver up to 35 percent more energy than fixed-tilt systems for a modest bump in cost. Horizontal tracking has “basically exploded over the past 10 to 15 years,” Eskilsson says.

But horizontal trackers suffer from the same latitudinal shortcomings as fixed-tilt: travel north or south from the equator, and the benefits diminish. Between the 30th and 40th parallels north—roughly aligned with Houston and Philadelphia, respectively—the equation shifts to favor vertical trackers: systems designed to intercept the grazing light of a low-hanging sun that would otherwise skim over a horizontal array.

A handful of companies offer static vertical panels. In Europe, Norway's Over Easy Solar and Germany's Next2Sun and SOLYCO Solar provide a variety of vertical solar panels that harvest morning, evening and winter light. Making vertical trackers, which pivot around an upright axis like a revolving door, is far more challenging. All vertical panels catch the wind like sails. Stationary setups can be made to resist powerful gusts, but vertical trackers are more fragile because they are mobile and mounted on a single post. Imagine a heavy roadside sign perched on a pole: the wind doesn't just push against the sign; it tries to twist the pole, too. Torsion around a vertical post is nastier than around a horizontal tracker's low-slung backbone, leading more easily to broken panels and motors. Efforts at beefing them up priced them out of existence. “These kinds of vertical trackers, even today, they cost like four times as much as horizontal trackers,” Eskilsson says. Developers in the north stuck with static systems, using more panels to make up for lost productivity.

Olsson, now 51 years old, became interested in solar in 2017, before it was common in his country. On a ski trip, he told a friend that Sweden didn't receive enough sunlight for the technology to work. The friend disagreed and showed him the math. “I realized when I saw the numbers that solar does make sense,” Olsson says. The moment sparked his love for a challenge, and he spent the train ride home writing a business plan.

Soldags, Olsson's first solar panel company, took off installing panels for consumers, usually on roofs. But two years in, he landed a contract to install panels on the ground, which required anchoring them with concrete blocks. “These things weighed 10 times more than the solar panels,” Olsson says. An engineering physicist by training and a recreational sailor, he knew how much torque wind could exert. Yet nature thrived in it—trees flexed, leaves feathered. Why did he have to burn money to hold panels still?

He shared his thoughts with his friend and fellow sailor Fredrik Lundell, a fluid dynamics professor and aerodynamics expert. As they spoke, they made sketches of a pivoting mount that might allow panels to feather in the wind.

Vaja's vertical panel arrays require no concrete. A row of more than 100 can rotate by a single motor and a cable system.

Andréas Lennartsson

At a cocktail party in 2023, Olsson approached Eskilsson, whom he viewed as the Swede most capable of taking a company global. Since his youth, Eskilsson, now 51, loved business. At 15, he began buying and selling computers. Then, as an exchange student in Canada, he saw his first trampoline and started shipping them to Sweden. He later co-founded an eye-tracking company, Tobii, which bought a patent from Olsson in 2007; Olsson came with it and went on to work at the company for 10 years.

By the time of the party, Eskilsson had stepped down as Tobii's CEO and was contemplating a sedate life serving on boards. Then Olsson pulled him aside to describe turning “the physics inside out” on solar farms, Eskilsson recalls.

The challenge wasn't just exciting—it was urgent, Eskilsson says. Currently, when the sun is low, other energy sources compensate for solar's decreased output. But some research suggests solar could make up 40 percent of global electricity production by 2050. At those rates, the difference between supply and demand would be too large for other energy sources to compensate. Reaching 40 percent penetration “is virtually impossible if you're going to do static-mounted solar,” Eskilsson claims. But tracking solar remains unavailable to a significant portion of the globe. “Somebody has to be able to do vertical tracking in a way that's actually cost-efficient,” he says.

They began working that September, the dwindling autumn sun a reminder of the faint light they intended to capture. Their challenge was to create a panel that wind couldn't destroy. In less than a month they had prototypes that pivoted near their aerodynamic center so they could move in a storm.

Lundell became an adviser. There was a wind tunnel at Sweden's KTH Royal Institute of Technology, where Lundell is a professor, but it was overbooked, and waiting for real storms was slow. He recommended they build an “inverted wind tunnel,” inspired by U.S. aerospace company Scaled Composites' tests of SpaceShipOne's tail in 2003, which involved driving prototypes on a truck across the Mojave Desert. About a week later, Olsson, Eskilsson and their first three employees had built their “trailer lab” and rented time on Lunda Airfield, 110 kilometers north of Stockholm.

The first months made clear why nobody had done this. “Everything broke,” Eskilsson says. They started with stiff plastic sheets in place of solar panels. As prototypes stabilized, the team switched to solar panels and kept fine-tuning. They couldn't load up the frame with metal and increase its weight and cost. Soon they reached 80 kph in their test drives. Panel after panel vibrated until it snapped off. They stopped the car each time and walked back along the runway with their brooms.

“Turbulence gives rise to different kinds of oscillations and resonance effects,” Eskilsson says. “It can be things like flutter; it can be torsional phenomena, etcetera, that get amplified by resonance.” If you've watched the video of Washington State's Tacoma Narrows Bridge wobbling as torsional flutter destroyed it in 1940, you might have a sense of the similar effect in play with the solar panels. During windstorms, early solar arrays got twisted into modern art.

Eskilsson has a summer house on an island in the Baltic Sea, and he and his colleagues set up panels on its dock with a camera feed. At home, when the news announced a storm, they sat at their computers, eating popcorn as wind destroyed their work. Sometimes they took a boat out as a storm rolled in and—in needling rain, screwdrivers in hand—adjusted the panels. “If you do it a little bit wrong, things start fluttering,” Olsson says.

When the mechanical-design experts the group hired said they doubted the project's feasibility, Olsson was undeterred. Eskilsson recalls, “I had two of them taking me aside in the corridor without [Olsson] there, saying, ‘Henrik, you do understand this is not possible.'” As prototypes kept breaking, he had moments when he feared they might be right.

Lundell recalls identifying a distinct flutter a second before a particular panel failed, captured in videos from the trailer and the wind tunnel. With typically paced testing, understanding such a phenomenon could take years, he says. But the high-speed footage acted like a time-lapse movie of the destruction, allowing the team to map every oscillation in real time. “A few weeks later, we had the theory,” Lundell says—a mathematical model of the aerodynamic center, the precise pivot point where wind would push a panel into a neutral position rather than shaking it apart.

For six months, Olsson and Eskilsson kept shifting the axis, strengthening parts in increments, careful to keep the weight low. They moved away from trial-and-error reinforcement and toward a passive-stability approach—treating the panel not as a wall to be braced but as a weather vane to be balanced. By nudging the pivot axis millimeter by millimeter toward the leading edge, they made the wind do the work of holding the panel steady. By June 2024, they were reaching 100 kph on the airstrip. “We shifted the axis again, even further toward the front, and reinforced the sideways structure,” Eskilsson says. This time the speedometer kept rising. They hit 140 kph—which exceeded the worst gusts most solar farms are likely to see. The panel feathered calmly. “Once you get rid of the instabilities,” Olsson says, “suddenly you can double the speed.” They laughed; then, to see just how far they could push the prototype, Eskilsson jammed the gas and broke one more panel.

Now they could assemble the pieces. The vertical panel arrays require no concrete. And a row of more than 100 can be rotated with a single motor and a cable system, the way a string moves slats in a venetian blind with the twist of a rod. When a storm nears, the motor “stows” the panels so the wind hits their backs. “If the wind hits from right behind the panels, you have virtually no torque at all,” Olsson says.

Olsson and Eskilsson named the company Vaja, a Swedish word meaning “to sway.” Vaja now has five test sites, and when forecasts promise trouble, they still grab their laptops to watch their solar arrays. “I look at the weather forecast four times a day,” Eskilsson says. “I'm not looking for sunny weather.”

According to their data, Vaja's system produces 25 to 30 percent more energy per year than a static array at many northern latitudes. Most of the company's funding has come from $1.6 million in government grants and a similar amount from investors; it will need to raise much more to scale its operations. So far, it has four paying pilot customers lined up. Swedish company Rabbalshede Kraft, an independent renewable-energy producer, is starting a side-by-side pilot: Vaja trackers next to conventional arrays. The trackers must “survive the tooth of the climate,” says the company's CEO Peter Wesslau. “There will also be more production because the panels will be moving across the day. Given that we will be able to produce in the more profitable hours, we also expect that we'll be making more money.” If Vaja delivers what Eskilsson “promised in blood,” Wesslau says, “a lot more solar projects will come into the money in the Nordic regions.”

Eskilsson has shed any doubts. He likes to joke that he and Olsson have made it this far because, between the two of them, they have the three traits of entrepreneurship: a reasonable brain, a thick forehead to bang against the wall and enough naivete to keep trying.

They still run tests on the airstrip to validate panels coming out of production. The SUV accelerates and reaches the speed where, not long ago, everything went wrong. Soon they pass the equivalent of gale-force winds. On the mast, the panel feathers, calm as a coasting bird. They ease off the pedal and glide to a stop. The broom stays in the trunk.

Amazon has spent two decades trying to disrupt Walmart's dominance. Now, it appears the e-commerce giant is taking those efforts to a whole new scale.

A new proposal for a massive, 229,000-square-foot Amazon facility in suburban Chicago looks and feels a lot like a classic Walmart superstore but with distinctive Amazon elements, including the ability to order items via app or kiosk for fulfillment from the back of the store.

The company describes the plans as part of its culture of experimentation — calling it “a new concept that we think customers will be excited about.” Amazon says the store will offer fresh groceries, household essentials, and general merchandise, making it convenient for customers to shop a broad selection of items in one trip.

“This could just be another experiment, but as experiments go, it reveals a degree of Walmart jealousy that we didn't expect,” wrote analysts Mike Levin and Josh Lowitz of Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP), in a report to subscribers this morning.

CIRP notes that while Amazon dominates e-commerce, online shopping accounts for less than 20% of U.S. retail spending, leaving the vast majority of consumer dollars on the table. 

Amazon has tried a variety of physical retail formats over the years, with mixed results, in addition to its acquisition of Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in 2017. Whole Foods CEO Jason Buechel was named a year ago to oversee Amazon's Worldwide Grocery Stores business, including its Amazon Fresh stores.

The company says it already serves more than 150 million grocery shoppers in the U.S., generating over $100 billion in grocery sales in 2024.

But with data showing that 93% of Amazon customers still shop at Walmart, CIRP suggests this new superstore concept is Amazon's admission that capturing the remaining addressable market requires building a physical moat that rivals the scale and utility of its biggest competitor.

While the footprint screams “traditional big box,” the plans signal that Amazon is attempting to put its own spin on the superstore format.

Filings with the Village of Orland Park indicate that a large portion of the building's floor plan is designated for “back of house” operations that support in-store and pickup orders. Part of the idea is to solve a headache that plagues modern grocery stores: the clash between in-store shoppers and gig-economy workers.

During an Orland Park planning commission hearing, an Amazon rep described a tech-enabled experience where the digital and physical worlds merge for general merchandise.

A customer might find a sweater on the rack in blue, but want it in red. Instead of searching through piles of inventory, they could use a dedicated app or in-store kiosk to request the item from the back room, picking it up at the front counter when they are finished shopping.

This is similar to an Amazon experiment at its Whole Foods locations — building a “store within a store” to bridge the gap between niche organic offerings and mass-market items.

Amazon last fall unveiled an automated micro-fulfillment center attached to a Whole Foods in Plymouth Meeting, Pa. The concept allows shoppers to browse organic produce in the aisles while simultaneously ordering non-Whole Foods items — like Tide Pods, Pepsi, or Doritos — via an app. Robots in the back pick the items, and the full order is ready for the customer on site.

The Orland Park superstore appears to be an industrial-sized evolution of that experiment.

“We like to explain it as: ‘It's the best that Amazon has to offer under Whole Foods, Fresh and their online offerings,' ” said Katie Jahnke Dale, a lawyer representing Amazon at the hearing.

The site plan includes dedicated queuing areas for delivery drivers and separate pickup lanes for customers, streamlining the flow of goods without disrupting the in-store experience.

The planning commission voted 6-1 to recommend approval of the project. The proposal now heads to the Orland Park Village Board of Trustees for a final vote, which is scheduled for Jan. 19. If approved, village officials estimate the store could open in late 2027.

The robotics company behind the Neo humanoid robot, 1X, has unveiled a new AI model that it says understands the dynamics of the real world and can help bots learn new information on their own.

This physics-based model, called 1X World Model, uses a combination of video and prompts to give Neo robots new abilities. The video allows Neo robots to learn new tasks they weren't previously trained on, according to 1X.

This release comes as 1X is gearing up to release its Neo humanoids into the home. The company opened up preorders for its humanoids in October with plans to ship the bots this year. A 1X spokesperson declined to share a timeline of when these bots were shipping or share any information regarding how many have been ordered beyond saying preorders exceeded expectations.

“After years of developing our world model and making Neo's design as close to human as possible, Neo can now learn from internet-scale video and apply that knowledge directly to the physical world,” Bernt Børnich, founder and CEO of 1X said in a statement. “With the ability to transform any prompt into new actions — even without prior examples — this marks the starting point of Neo's ability to teach itself to master nearly anything you could think to ask.”

Saying that the bot can transform any prompt into a new action is a lofty claim and not entirely accurate; you can't tell a Neo to drive a car and it will suddenly know how to parallel park, for instance. But there is some learning going on. 

1X isn't saying the world model allows today's Neo bots to do a new task right away from capturing video and being prompted, a company spokesperson clarified. Instead, the bot takes video data linked to specific prompts and then sends that back into the world model. That model is then fed back into the network of bots to give them a better understanding of the physical world and more know-how. 

It also gives users insight into how Neo is thinking of behaving or reacting to a certain prompt. That kind of behavioral information could help 1X train these models to a point where robots will be able to react to a prompt of something they've never done before.

At the time, the common wisdom was that they'd go the same route as Adobe: you'd have to buy Final Cut X+1 in a couple years for another $299, and Final Cut X+2 a couple years after that... to their credit, that's not the way it's gone.So that way, I imagine, all the film folks have a little more money to chuck at their high-powered Mac hardware budgets in the next refresh cycle instead... An evergreen Final Cut Pro license costs almost as much as 1TB of SSD from those guys!

And that's despite Apple having zero interest in doing things that don't ultimately make them money.I have a theory for how sales of these one-time-purchase yet indefinitely-updated apps happens to work out positively on Apple's balance sheet, while it doesn't for most other large players right now.And that's that, due to Apple's vertical integration (they make the hardware, they make the OS that runs on the hardware, they make the apps that run on the OS) — and due to these apps only targeting their own OSes+hardware, with no consideration of portability to other platforms — a lot (like 90+%) of the ""enablement"" work for these apps ends up time-budgeted as OS work, rather than apps work.Or, I guess, to be more charitable, you could say that Apple's engineers develop first-party apps not just to sell them, but at least in part to drive the development of the OS as a developer platform. You could even describe the OS frameworks as the product, and the apps themselves as the byproduct. (In that lens, the only reason FCP would cost anything at all is to avoid accusations of anti-competitive behavior.)

Office 2024 has every feature that was added since Office 2021 to the subscription version - while a chunk of loyal customers are unaware of them.
Back when Google was competing hard with Google Suite, a big perception problem formed with the perpetual customers believing and convincing others that Google were far ahead, with collab editing and other features - after Office had added equivalent.So for me, If there's a subscription and one-time option - I wonder if the one-time gets all updates going forward. If it doesn't, I realise that they'll regret that if competition picks up, and try to fix it later.
If it does include updates... I worry it will be like many other lifetime updates one-time purchases - when competition is low they'll renege on that promise.

Apple wants its customers to buy/subscribe to these tools so that you're in the Apple ecosystem and buy more hardware and services.Unlike Adobe, they have profit-maximizing incentives to let you stay on the buy/rent model that you prefer.

There are many discussions e.g. https://gearspace.com/board/music-computers/1433515-why-does... about the reasons for its popularity, but one stands out to me - its event data model.There are far too many tools out there (from FL Studio on one end, to MuseScore on the other) that present piano-roll-based rapid prototyping and traditional western score notation as diametric opposites. From day 1, Logic challenged itself ""what if we can use the same event-based data model to render both.""None of this complexity is hidden - you can edit the raw event stream directly. If you're a developer familiar with, say, React, it makes music creation quite intuitive - everything from visual to audio output is a function of a transparently formatted data store.And while that has its challenges, and some of the UX innovations of e.g. MuseScore have been slower to arrive in Logic, because of this ""dual life"" it's unmatched as a pedogogical tool, and a professional creative tool as well.

Considering them as alternate views of the same data model gets problematic when the composer uses the full bag of tricks that score notation allows (notably repeats, but also the problem of representing tuplets correctly when a pianoroll can offer no clues about how to structure them). So for example, the user can create a set of notes in the pianoroll that will never be played correctly by anyone reading the score; the user can create dynamics in the score that cannot be correctly presented in the pianoroll version.I'm not saying it isn't possible to do an MVC-style system with two different views of the same data model - it clearly is. It's just moving between the two views is not lossless, and moving between the two controllers (i.e. editing) is not equivalent.

As someone who defended FCPX and used it professionally for years even when it was at its most hated (2011 or so), it's been woefully supported the last few years and no one should be on it anymore. Resolve Studio outclasses it top to bottom for the same one-time cost and runs great on both MacOS and Windows. Linux it's bumpy unfortunately but it does technically run lol

reply

Best 200-300 EUR I spent some years ago, and still receives free updates, Blackmagic Design is a really nice company.

The larger problem is that the iPad has a dual nature. At the launch of the product, Apple positioned it as a netbook killer - i.e. a simplified computer for specific tasks, one where the locked down nature of the device might actually be considered a feature. That's why they built everything on iPhone OS[0]. However, there's always been the implication that this is supposed to Someday™ replace the Mac. It keeps getting new features to make it more useful as a computer replacement, which just makes the deliberate restrictions placed on the device more and more glaring. And Apple seems to think they can just keep adding features until they can make you do every computing task wearing a strait-jacket in a padded room.This particular duality came to a head with the Apple Vision Pro. Any app that would actually be useful on a VR headset is either:- Incompatible with Apple's code-signing and containerization requirements (i.e. developer tools)- Not economic to offer at the small scale of the visionOS app market (at least, not while Apple is demanding 30%)- A game (Apple really doesn't wanna talk about the Vision Pro as a games machine)On a related note, Swift Playgrounds stopped getting updates almost a year ago. I updated my HTML editor demo project for iPadOS 26 and now I can't even compile it because Apple has yet to ship the version 26 SDK. And there's really nothing any third party can do to fix Swift Playgrounds to make it actually usable again.[0] Strictly speaking, Apple's first internal demos of capacitive touch were for a tablet project specifically to spite Windows XP tablets. Although by the time they were writing actual shipping code it was intended for iPhone and iPad came later.

It isn't about doing and publishing apps without having to buy a mac.Rather having a more powerful development experience that isn't as constrained as Swift Playgrounds, useful for prototyping ideas.I do not care if in a similar vein, to a Smalltalk like environment I would always need to run the app from inside the dev env, and then use a Mac, or some cloud build workflow if I ever would like to actually publish it.Just like I use several other coding on the go environments.

My experience is that while there's a feature and community gap for both Pixelmator Pro and Affinity, Affinity just tried to copy Photoshop, positioning it as a worse but cheaper Photoshop, while Pixelmator Pro feels like an attempt to make a better photo editor, losing some familiarity points but also being tangibly better than Photoshop at most use cases it can handle, which is many. It's also an excellent macOS citizen. Between those two factors, it seems much more up Apple's alley.

In a feature film production, these would certainly be separate roles. But apart from maybe Logic Pro for composers, Apple's tools are not really relevant at those levels of the entertainment business anymore. Post-pro would be Pro Tools for audio, something like Avid Media Composer for editing etc.I think Apple has realized they are not playing on that level anymore and target their marketing to where they are still in the game. That's not necessarily a bad move.

> The O-1 category includes the O-1A, which is designated for individuals with extraordinary ability in the sciences, education, business or athletics and the O-1B, reserved for those with “extraordinary ability or achievement”.Then later it says> The O-1B visa, once reserved for Hollywood titans and superstar musicians, has evolved over the years.I understand those two aren't necessarily contradictory, but the wording of the first sentence paints a very different mental picture than the second one (at least it did for me), especially since they throw in the O-1A and then almost exclusively talk about people applying for the O-1B after that.Personally, I don't want the US choosing to give visas to influencers over scientists, but if this visa was already being heavily used to bring in actors, musicians, and athletes I don't see what the hubbub is about. I don't use TikTok or OnlyFans and I don't find e-sports entertaining, but I have a hard time arguing that a screen actor, Victoria's Secret model, or soccer player should be worthy of a visa and a social media star, OnlyFans model, or a professional Counter Strike player shouldn't is not. It's all just entertainment.

Also this visa in uncapped so giving visas to OF models does not take away anything from scientists and others.O visa's original intent was to help pretty ladies from Eastern Europe to be brought into the country as indentured workers. That is why it is so easy to get this visa for an actor or a fashion model but very tough to get someone for their research.So all this is working as intended.

For traditional arts, you've gotta be good.For an influencer... some number of anonymous followers?There are certainly some that would qualify... but it they should be held to the same standards as others.

You might be shocked to find out how much the performers being written about in magazines or discussed on TV shows is a direct line to the production company promoting them. Similar for awards.

Commercial value and celebrity has always been one of the metrics of ""achievement"".The overall gist is that the visa application should be someone who is not easily replaced by an existing local worker that can generate similar value.

8 CFR 214.2(o)(3) ( https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/part-214/section-214.2#... )    Extraordinary ability in the field of arts   means distinction. Distinction means a high level of achievement in the field of arts evidenced by a degree of skill and recognition substantially above that ordinarily encountered to the extent that a person described as prominent is renowned, leading, or well-known in the field of arts.

    Extraordinary ability in the field of science, education, business, or athletics   means a level of expertise indicating that the person is one of the small percentage who have arisen to the very top of the field of endeavor.

    Extraordinary achievement   with respect to motion picture and television productions, as commonly defined in the industry, means a very high level of accomplishment in the motion picture or television industry evidenced by a degree of skill and recognition significantly above that ordinarily encountered to the extent that the person is recognized as outstanding, notable, or leading in the motion picture or television field.

The key is that this is extraordinary.  About 20,000 O1B visas across all fields ( https://www.passright.com/how-many-o-1-visas-are-issued-each... )This isn't a local worker thing (the H visas) but rather bringing the best and brightest from across the world to the United States.https://www.hio.harvard.edu/o-1-visa-individuals-extraordina...> The O-1 visa is a temporary work visa designated for individuals who have achieved and sustained national or international acclaim for extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business or athletics, or individuals who have demonstrated a record of extraordinary achievement in the motion picture and television industries.> O-1 Extraordinary Ability visa status is reserved for those who are among the small percentage of experts who have risen to the top of their field. The approval of an O-1 petition by the United States Citizenship & Immigration Services (USCIS) decides whether an individual qualifies for O-1 classification. This classification requires a substantial amount of evidence. The O-1 is a very complicated visa category subject to high levels of scrutiny by the U.S. government. Due to the complexity, the O-1 visa is used very infrequently.

You say ""We should encourage X over Y"" and the retorts are    * ""Y will still exist"" 
    * ""Y can still be encouraged separately""
    * ""You should tell me the difference between X and Y""
    * ""Hey, I found an X that sometimes acts vaguely similar to Y!""

None directly disagree with the original point, but they do imply fault in the original reasoning without providing any proof or requiring any effort.The third one is a classic. A concise implication of error in which a good-faith response would be long-winded and boring comparatively.To what end?What are they hoping to get out of disagreeing with someone trying to encouraging our future culture to be one of relative wholesomeness?...

The original poster was clearly not making an analogy between professional soccer and only fans creators.To be explicit, the comparisons were:Cinematic actors -> TikTok creatorsVictoria's Secret model -> only fans creatorPro soccer -> esportsI fail to see how the culture of our country will be negatively impacted by any of those changes. Comparing Cristiano Renaldo to OnlyFans is a straw man because that specific comparison was never suggested, except by the “rebuttal”

I watched the Mr. Beast episode of David Letterman's show, and I had no expectations but figured he must have some charisma as the most watched youtube person. He was unable to explain basic concepts, had no self-awareness, and generally seemed detached from any sort of reality. It was shocking to think that is who is shaping young peoples minds.

They're also not fungible and extremely mobile. People get attached to specific OF stars and the medium inherently requires remote work. So it's an inherently global labour force that protectionism won't help. American OF models won't magically make more money if you ban immigration unless you also ban cultural imports.The government isn't displacing local talent by importing OF models and gets tax dollars for essentially doing nothing. Those tax dollars pay for schools/hospitals/etc.OF also skews towards young, unmarried women, which balances the gender surplus of unmarried men that generally tries to immigrate. Since they're young, they also have more productivity before drawing on benefits like Medicare or Social Security.By any objective standard OF models are the ideal migrant.

Isn't that a derogatory stereotype? Aren't those men (and women and other folks) as “exploited” as a reader of a book or a player of a game, who understands they're about to be a part of a fantasy but willingly suspend the disbelief for a short while?It's only exploitation if this suspension of disbelief is artificially prolonged in nefarious way, with a self-reinforcing fantasy so the person loses touch with the reality and spends increasingly unhealthy amounts of time in a fantasy, or otherwise get conditioned and start to exhibit addiction-like behaviors that aren't in their best long-term interests.That happens (every entertainment industry has its whales), but saying it's the norm (rather than a pathological extremity) is sort of stigmatizing.

Consent does not bless immoral acts or neutralize damage. A person who takes a drug voluntarily is still being harmed by it. It causes changes in the consumer whether he likes it or not. Causality does not care about your consent.(And to address your analogy to books, the content of a work of fiction also matters. Reading bad books isn't good for your mind either. But literary fiction at least has the potential to be good. The genre isn't categorically bad.)And porn is addictive. Porn addiction is extremely widespread and afflicts mostly young men. Porn's ubiquity and the easy with which it can be accessed has created a situation that did not exist before, and from a young age. And not only is it addictive, but it does real psychological damage to these consumers, creating what some call ""porn brain"". It is an excellent method for producing sexually-crippled creeps and incels unable - and even uninterested, given the nature of their ""fantasy"" - to have healthy relationships with real human beings, and the stats corroborate this.It is an incredibly twisted and deranging vice. It destroys individuals and has a destructive impact on society as a whole.

But at the same time, the immigration system historically penalized anyone who engages in prostitution and actively denied entry to people found to be engaged in it. There is an explicit question about this in all immigration forms. Which is why it's surprising that O-1 visas are being awarded to OnlyFans models. Maybe OF isn't prostitution according to how it's being interpreted, but it's very surprising.

                Reading time 2 minutes
      

Google has quietly pulled back some AI-generated health summaries at the same time that the industry is seemingly racing to embed AI into healthcare. The move came after The Guardian found some of the information provided by the feature was misleading.

The Guardian reported Sunday that Google had removed AI-generated search summaries for the queries “what is the normal range for liver blood tests” and “what is the normal range for liver function tests.” As of Tuesday morning, those searches no longer provide an AI Overview at the top of the page. Instead, users are shown short excerpts pulled from traditional search results.

According to The Guardian, the AI Overviews for those liver-related searches and others had “served up inaccurate health information and put people at risk of harm.” For example, the summaries reportedly provided for the liver test searchers included “masses of numbers, little context and no accounting for nationality, sex, ethnicity or age of patients.”

The Guardian reported that some experts said these results could be dangerous. For instance, someone with liver disease might delay follow-up care if they rely on an AI-generated definition of what's normal.

“We invest significantly in the quality of AI Overviews, particularly for topics like health, and the vast majority provide accurate information,” a Google spokesperson told Gizmodo in an emailed statement. “Our internal team of clinicians reviewed what's been shared with us and found that in many instances, the information was not inaccurate and was also supported by high quality websites. In cases where AI Overviews miss some context, we work to make broad improvements, and we also take action under our policies where appropriate.”

The removals come at a moment when more people than ever are turning to AI for answers about their health, and the industry is taking notice.

OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, said last week that roughly a quarter of its 800 million regular users submit a healthcare-related prompt every week, with more than 40 million doing so daily.

Days later, OpenAI launched ChatGPT Health, a health-focused experience that can connect with users' medical records, wellness apps, and wearable devices. And shortly after that, the company announced it had acquired the healthcare startup Torch, which tracks medical records including lab results, recordings from doctor visits, and medications.

Meanwhile, rival AI company Anthropic is not far behind. On Monday, the company announced a new set of AI tools that allow healthcare providers, insurers, and patients to use its Claude chatbot for medical purposes.

For hospitals and insurance companies, Anthropic says the tools can help streamline tasks such as prior authorization requests and patient communications. For patients, Claude can be given access to lab results and health records to generate summaries and explanations in plain language.

As AI advances in healthcare, even minor errors or missing context can have significant consequences for patients. Whether these companies are ready for that remains to be seen.

On Monday, former New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who just left office following the election of Zohran Mamdani, promoted the launch of a new NYC Token memecoin on the Solana blockchain via a press conference, social media, and interviews. According to Adams, the goal of the crypto token is to help “fight anti-semitism” across the country.

“We know cities can run better, and by using this New York City Token, we're going to continue to invest in making our city a safer city,” said Adams during his press event. “I am not going anywhere.”

Adams added that funds raised through the token offering would be used to build a non-profit organization, where the former mayor would initially refrain from taking a salary.

According to blockchain observers, the NYC Token launch was successful in terms of generating funds, as movements of cryptocurrency on the Solana network indicate that at least $2.5 million worth of the token was liquidated into Circle's USDC stablecoin by entities involved with the original launch. This followed a common pump-and-dump pattern seen in many of the meme coins launched on Solana over the past couple of years, which occurred less than an hour after the coin went live.

As a result of the price action and blockchain activity following the NYC Token launch, Adams has been accused of operating a pump-and-dump scam, which is extremely common with these sorts of crypto coins and is often referred to as a rug pull. Data from DEXTools indicates the token went from roughly $0.12 to nearly $0.60 before falling below its original starting point. This all happened in a little over an hour.

In a statement posted on X, the NYC Token team wrote:

Given the overwhelming support and demand for the token at launch, our partners had to rebalance the liquidity. We are aware of reports flagging the transactions removing liquidity from the pool.

The team commenced the funds for TWAP and added additional funds to the liquidity pool.

We're in it for the long haul!

Adams notably embraced Bitcoin and crypto during his mayoral campaign, and quickly became referred to as the “Bitcoin Mayor” after his election win. In fact, NYC Token is not the first cryptocurrency Adams has been involved with, as he helped launch New York City Coin during his time in office. This was a separate token that was released on top of the Stacks blockchain and was supposedly going to be used to fund various government services via investments made in the NYC-focused coin. The project behind the token, known as CityCoins, launched a similar project in Miami around the same time. Of course, neither token gained much traction despite the endorsements of the local mayors.

Eric Adams, former NYC major, has just removed liquidity of his new memecoin, $NYC, scamming investors for over $2,536,301

He launched a $NYC memecoin just 30 minutes ago, and has removed its liquidity after promoting it on his personal social media, claiming to be the NYC token https://t.co/4s20jOTKEN pic.twitter.com/pFAG7l0XMq

— Rune (@RuneCrypto_) January 12, 2026



A large number of entertainers, politicians, and other celebrities have been caught up in various memecoin schemes over the past couple of years, with everyone from Argentine President Javier Milei to the “Hawk Tuah” girl getting involved. Of course, U.S. President Trump also launched his own memecoin around the time of his inauguration, which is just one of his many dubious and allegedly corrupt activities in the crypto space.

Many of these celebrity-endorsed initiatives operated in the same quick pump-and-dump manner as Adams's NYC Token, although crypto-native marketers were often the ones behind the schemes, simply paying celebrities for their endorsements. Celebrities' social media accounts have also been hacked to promote these types of coins. Of course, some have questioned whether some of these “hacks” were simply a way for celebrities to promote outright scams without much blowback.

While bitcoin and stablecoins have clearly found product-market fit, the vast majority of alternative crypto tokens that promised various alternative technical innovations are still mostly seen as dubious. In some ways, memecoins are the more honest version of the altcoin market, where there is no expectation of real utility or long-term adoption, and the degenerate gambling aspect of the crypto market is fully embraced. In other words, it's a casino, albeit one that is likely even more rigged than traditional markets or gambling venues.

Framework had raised prices on memory modules, but now the memory crisis is hitting the company's systems.

Framework, the DIY-focused PC manufacturer, has announced that it is raising prices on its desktop PC as a result of continuing RAM shortages rocking the consumer technology industry. ""We held off on it as long as we could, but with LPDDR5x memory prices from our suppliers continuing to increase rapidly, we've had to update the pricing on Framework Desktop systems and Mainboards,"" Framework CEO Nirav Patel wrote in an updated blog post detailing the company's response to the memory crisis. The base configuration, with a Ryzen AI Max 385, Radeon 8050S graphics, and 32GB of RAM, used to start at $1,099, but now starts at $1,139. The top configuration, with a Ryzen AI Max+ 395 processor featuring Radeon 8060S graphics and 128GB of RAM, used to start at $1,999, but now it is $2,459.Framework has been particularly transparent about its price increases — moreso than the big box OEMs. The company made its last increase specifically for RAM modules in December, and at the time suggested that more increases would likely be coming. This, however, is the first time that pricing has directly affected Framework's systems. The Framework Desktop stands in a unique place in the company's lineup, as it's the only product that it sells with soldered RAM, which is necessary for use with the AMD ""Strix Halo"" APU. That means that, unlike its laptops, Framework can't sell a version of the Desktop and let you buy your RAM elsewhere. Patel wrote in the blog update that Framework is only raising prices to cover increased costs from suppliers. And he doesn't seem to think things are getting better: ""The memory outlook as we enter 2026 continues to get worse,"" he wrote. Framework isn't the only company raising prices (though it may be one of the few with regular blog posts about it). Dell, Asus, and other PC manufacturers have price increases on the way. We've also seen announcements of hikes from single-board computer leader Raspberry Pi. RAM prices have been rising as suppliers have turned their focus to lucrative deals supplying AI datacenters, leaving fewer options for people building their own PCs and for the companies that build them for potential customers. This move is a sign that 2026 will continue to be a rocky market for companies selling PCs and for people who want to build them alike.

This move will build goodwill towards its Chinese customers.

Nvidia has refuted the rumor that it would require full advanced payment for H200 orders from its Chinese customers. The AI chip maker stated that it will not ask its clients to completely pay for an item that it has yet to receive. “We do not require upfront payment and would never require customers to pay for products that they do not receive,” an Nvidia spokesperson said in an email to Tom's Hardware.

Nvidia's comment was first reported by Reuters. According to that report, one source claimed that Nvidia had previously required advanced payments from Chinese clients, sometimes only a deposit instead of a full upfront payment. The article claims that because it's unclear whether Beijing will allow its tech companies to purchase Nvidia H200 GPUs, the company has been ""particularly strict"" in enforcing these conditions to reduce financial risk.

Even though China-based tech giants like Alibaba and ByteDance are reportedly ready to order over 200,000 of these chips each, the H200 is a last-generation chip that has since been superseded by the Blackwell family. Aside from that, Nvidia has already announced the succeeding Vera Rubin architecture, which is miles ahead in performance and efficiency over the previous-generation GPUs.

As such, companies that have no restrictions will likely only want to purchase the latest available technology as they spend billions of dollars on AI infrastructure to gain an advantage over their competitors. So, if the Chinese government changes its tone at the last moment and refuses to approve the H200 orders of its tech companies, then Nvidia risks being left with hundreds of thousands of H200 GPUs that it would probably have a lot of difficulty selling. Furthermore, those chips would have taken up the production capacity of Nvidia's contracted fabs, which it could have instead used for building GB200 or even newer chips that will sell for a much higher margin.

The assertion that Nvidia won't require upfront payment for the H200 chips from Chinese customers will be welcome news, as it reduces their risk while waiting for the final green light from Beijing. The AI chip maker is likely able to easily do this because it reportedly still has over 80,000 H200 chips available in existing stock, reducing its exposure to vacillating political decisions. More than that, it will build goodwill towards Chinese companies and the government — something that the company is carefully balancing with its relationship with the U.S. government, the Trump administration, and the American people.

Trashbench succeeded where others failed, thanks in large part to the size of his freezer.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


TrashBench, a hardware enthusiast and YouTuber that we've covered in the past, has a specific talent for clever-but-chaotic PC experiments. In his latest video, he's managed something that has tripped up far bigger channels before him: he successfully ran a desktop PC at –28°C inside a household freezer, benchmarked it, overclocked it, and pulled the hardware out afterward cold and bone-dry.

The concept of the freezer PC is obviously not a new idea. Plenty of creators, including Linus Tech Tips, have tried putting PCs in freezers, only to be defeated by condensation, thermal instability, or both. TrashBench's twist was realizing that the freezer itself was the limiting factor, and that solving the problem wasn't about exotic coatings, or insane insulation, or extreme temperatures, but instead, size and patience.

The exotic cooling enthusiast didn't risk modern flagship silicon here, and that restraint was probably a factor in the experiment's success. The setup consisted of an ASUS ROG Maximus XI Apex motherboard, an Intel Core i7-9700KF, an ASUS ROG GeForce GTX 1070 (despite charts briefly claiming GTX 1060; chalk that up to beer, not malice), a Thermalright Phantom Spirit air cooler, some G.SKILL Trident Z RGB memory, and a SilverStone Strider 750 EF power supply. Everything except the PSU went into the freezer.

 




By 2026 standards, this is firmly 'old hardware,' but that's exactly the point. If something went catastrophically wrong, the loss was survivable, and just as importantly, these parts draw far less power than modern high-end CPUs and GPUs. Lower heat output matters when your 'cooling system' is a household freezer with a compressor designed to deal with groceries, not a 600 W load spike.

Instead of resting components on shelves or freezer walls, TrashBench completely emptied the freezer and instead suspended them in mid-air using flexible straps. Cables were carefully routed and sealed to minimize moisture ingress from outside air. At the bottom of the chest freezer, he placed silica gel packed into breathable socks, acting as an active desiccant system. That combination of large freezer volume, minimal airflow turbulence, and aggressive moisture control is what allowed the system to stabilize instead of instantly fogging up and dying.

TrashBench tested performance before freezing, inside the freezer at stock clocks, and again after manual GPU overclocking. The benchmarks included 3DMark Time Spy, 3DMark Fire Strike, Cyberpunk 2077, Far Cry 6, and Shadow of the Tomb Raider, all venerable tests well-suited to the 2016-vintage hardware. Simply placing the PC components into the –28 °C freezer resulted in very marginal performance improvements. In most cases, the difference was within the noise; the only clear hardware-level gain was a 51 MHz increase in sustained GPU clock, thanks to lower operating temperatures.

 




Manual GPU overclocking of around +240 MHz on the core produced more noticeable gains, albeit still nothing earth-shattering. The largest uplift was in Shadow of the Tomb Raider, which gained about 8% (102 FPS to 110 FPS), and then 3DMark Fire Strike improved about 7%. Other tests showed smaller improvements, and TrashBench didn't specify exact in-game settings, so the results should be taken as directional rather than definitive. In other words: freezing your PC won't magically turn a GTX 1070 into a monster.

After benchmarking, TrashBench was able to remove the parts from the freezer and verify that they were not only still cold (at just 9°C), but in his words, ""dryer than a GPU market."" In YouTube comments, he added that he didn't actually expect the experiment to work at all. So why did his test work when others failed? The secret wasn't that the freezer was cold — it's that it was big. Smaller freezers heat up almost instantly under load, causing rapid temperature swings and repeated crossings of the dew point, which happen to be the exact conditions that create condensation.

In contrast, a large chest freezer acts less like an air conditioner and more like a cold reservoir. Hundreds of liters of air pre-cooled to –28 °C can absorb several hundred watts of heat for minutes before warming significantly, thanks to thermal inertia slowing temperature changes, reduced hot air recirculation thanks to open space, more cold wall surface area for passive heat absorption, and lower relative humidity spikes, even with minor air leakage.

 




The silica gel worked because the environment was stable. In a small freezer, the desiccant is quickly overwhelmed. In a large one, it actually has time to scrub moisture from the circulating air. TrashBench didn't try to make the freezer continuously cool a running PC, which would be an impossible task. He treated it as a temporary thermal battery, spent carefully during the benchmark runs.

TrashBench's conclusion is cheeky in a typically-Australian way: 'Like everything in life, size does matter.' He also notes that this kind of setup only really makes sense if you're planning to push overclocking harder than he did here — and doing that for long would almost certainly overstress the freezer's compressor. The takeaway: size matters, but so do expectations.

Children with food allergies may have higher-than-expected rates of short stature and low weight, according to a Dutch study.

“The age period between 5 and 12 months could be the most important time to monitor growth and possibly intervene in growth deterioration” in infants with food allergies, the authors wrote. 

B.J. Vlieg-Boerstra, PhD, with OLVG Hospital, Amsterdam, Netherlands, was the corresponding author of the study, which was published online on December 26 in Pediatric Allergy and Immunology.

Growth patterns in this population might relate to insufficient diet, increased gut permeability, inflammation, diarrhea, or vomiting, but the specific reasons are not known, the authors wrote. The researchers focused on patients at a single center and excluded patients who did not have matching reference values by ethnicity.

This research was financially supported by Nutricia and OLVG Research. Two authors reported receiving grants, research funding, honoraria, or consultancy or speaker's fees from various institutions and pharmaceutical companies, including the funders of the study.

The annual rate of alcohol-related hospitalizations in the US remained stable from 2016 to 2022, but in-hospital mortality and length of stay increased, with related costs reaching nearly $33 billion, a new cross-sectional study showed.

“Expansion of evidence-based policies to reduce alcohol consumption and AUD treatment engagement is needed to improve patient outcomes and reduce the $32.6 billion in healthcare costs incurred by alcohol-related hospitalizations,” the investigators wrote.

This study was led by Eden Y. Bernstein, MD, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado. It was published online on December 23 in JAMA Network Open.

The potential misclassification of diagnostic codes may have led to undercounting of AUD cases and alcohol-related hospitalizations; and alcohol consumption could have contributed to hospitalizations through diseases that were not directly alcohol-related. Additionally, the presence of multiple insurance coverages could not be accounted for in the analysis of trends across primary payers.

This study was funded by the National Institute on Aging. Two of the six investigators reported having several financial relationships, which are fully listed in the original article. The other researchers reported no relevant conflicts of interest.

Ethosuximide, a T-type calcium channel blocker, showed no significant benefit in reducing the intensity of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-related abdominal pain compared with placebo. The trial found higher discontinuation rates in the ethosuximide group due to adverse events.

“[T]hese results suggest that ethosuximide cannot be recommended for the treatment of IBS-related abdominal pain because of its poor tolerability and modest efficacy,” the authors of the study wrote.

The study was led by Nicolas Kerckhove, PhD, University Hospital of Clermont-Ferrand and Université Clermont Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, France. It was published online in January 2026, in JAMA Network Open.

The dropout rate in the ethosuximide group was high owing to poor tolerability. Visceral sensitivity was not assessed, and plasma ethosuximide concentrations were not measured, which may have aided in the characterization of responders and nonresponders.

The study was supported by the French Ministry for Health and the Société Française d'Etude et de Traitement de la Douleur. Some authors reported receiving personal fees from various pharmaceutical, healthcare, and medical technology companies.

Residents of areas with a higher Climate Vulnerability Index (CVI) were significantly more likely to develop type 2 diabetes (T2D) independent of other risk factors, in a study based on data from more than 1 million individuals.

“Climate change and social vulnerability are increasingly recognized as contributors to chronic disease, yet no prior work had examined whether a multidimensional climate vulnerability measure is linked to new-onset [T2D],” said lead study author Jad Ardakani, MD, a postdoctoral clinical research fellow at the Houston Methodist DeBakey Heart & Vascular Center in Houston.

“Rising heat, infrastructure stresses, and socioeconomic disparities across regions like Houston made it timely to evaluate whether place-based vulnerability adds meaningful risk information for diabetes beyond traditional factors,” he told Medscape Medical News.

The US CVI was designed to assess the interactions between climate risks and health at the neighborhood level in order to inform research, funding, and policy decisions. It uses 184 indicators to evaluate the conditions that shape a community, from housing quality and supermarket access to nearby toxic waste sites. These findings are combined into seven vulnerability and risk categories, including health, environment, infrastructure, social and economic, and others, to determine the overall CVI for each community.

In a study published in JAMA Network Open, the researchers reviewed data from 1,003,526 adults aged 18 years or older who had at least one outpatient encounter and one subsequent healthcare encounter at a single center in Texas between June 2016 and August 2023. The mean age of the participants was 51 years, and 60% were women; 57% were White, 16% were Hispanic, 13% were Black, 7% were Asian, and 4% were of other ethnicity or ethnicity unknown. The overall incidence of T2D was 1.88 cases per 100 person-years over a follow-up period up to 7 years.

Patients were divided into CVI quartiles based on residential addresses recorded in their electronic health records.

Overall, the risk for T2D was significantly associated with residence in the highest CVI quartile vs the lowest CVI quartile, independent of demographic socioeconomic and clinical factors (hazard ratio [HR], 1.23).

Diabetes incidence was approximately twice as high among participants residing in the highest vs the lowest CVI quartile (2.66 vs 1.48 cases per 100 person-years). In addition, the risk for T2D over the 7-year follow-up period was significantly higher among the highest CVI quartile residents than among the lowest CVI quartile residents (14.1% vs 8.6%).

The magnitude of the association varied by clinical and demographic subgroups, with higher HRs for individuals younger than 50 years (HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.47-1.57), women, and individuals who were Hispanic or White or of other ethnicities.

“The overall association was expected, but the strength of the relationship in younger adults and those with normal BMI was notable,” said Ardakani. “This pattern suggests that environmental and structural vulnerabilities may accelerate metabolic risk even before traditional risk factors appear.”

“The large contribution from infrastructure and socioeconomic domains was also striking, reinforcing how strongly structural inequities influence diabetes development,” he said.

More research is needed to identify the mechanisms behind the association between CVI and T2D, but the results suggest value in using CVI to assess risk at the local level and inform tailored public health outreach and interventions, Ardakani and colleagues concluded.

One thing to do would be to incorporate neighborhood context into risk assessment, especially for patients in highly vulnerable census tracts, Ardakani told Medscape Medical News.

Other actions include increased screening for prediabetes and metabolic risk in individuals from high-CVI areas, even when BMI is normal, and prioritizing referrals to diabetes prevention programs, nutrition services, and physical activity resources for patients living in vulnerable communities, he said. In addition, geocoded indices such as CVI could be used to guide population health outreach and tailor preventive strategies, he noted.

Ardakani acknowledged that the study was limited by several factors, including the single-system design, reliance on administrative data, limited individual-level socioeconomic and lifestyle information, and potential residual confounding.

“Additional research should validate these findings in other regions, explore causal pathways including specific environmental exposures, and test interventions that reduce diabetes risk in climate-vulnerable neighborhoods,” he said.

“Climate change is lived as a chronic condition, not just experienced as episodic crises such as stifling heat waves or devastating flooding,” Charles E. Leonard, PharmD, MSCE, MPH, associate professor at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, told Medscape Medical News.

The current study's overall finding, while important, was not especially surprising, although risk seemed to be driven by structural and social vulnerabilities, with climate-specific factors adding to risk rather than dominating it, Leonard noted. “Such a pattern is broadly consistent with how chronic disease develops and clusters in communities affected by long-term disinvestment,” he said.

“A seminal take-home message from the current study is the importance of context,” Leonard said. “Metabolic risk surely does not arise in isolation, and community conditions matter,” he emphasized.

Although the impact of community conditions does not change existing diabetes treatment paradigms, it may support earlier screening or closer follow-up for patients living in vulnerable environments, even when traditional risk markers such as dyslipidemia look relatively reassuring, he added.

Looking ahead, “more understanding is needed of how structural conditions, social environment, and climate-related stressors such as exposure to extreme ambient temperatures interact over time to affect diabetes risk,” said Leonard.

“Work that links these exposures longitudinally and considers how they intersect with prevention measures and access to care is essential before study findings are translated more directly into practice,” he said.

The study was funded by the Jerold B. Katz Foundation and by an award from the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability. Ardakani disclosed having no financial conflicts of interest. Leonard disclosed consulting for Shine Lawyers (Australia) and Moderna and previously consulting for Novo Nordisk on diabetes topics unrelated to climate change.

 January 13, 2026  

At the 2025 Dermatology Days of Paris conference, held from 2 to 6 December 2025, in Paris, France, Bertrand Richert, MD, PhD, professor in the Dermatology Department, Brugmann and Saint Pierre University Hospitals, Université Libre de Bruxelles, and Queen Fabiola Children's University Hospital in Brussels, Belgium, reviewed recent diagnostic and therapeutic developments in nail disorders, highlighting their practical implications for routine dermatology practice.

Two common inflammatory skin diseases may be exclusively localised to the nail area: lichen planus and psoriasis.

Nail lichen planus may lead to chronic lesions with substantial functional impairment. When the disease is confined to the nail, intralesional triamcinolone acetonide is now considered the first-line therapy in both adults and children.

The management of nail psoriasis depends on the number of affected nails. Systemic therapy is recommended when more than three nails are involved. In such cases, cyclosporine provides the most rapid clinical response. Psoriasis biologic therapies may subsequently be considered, with no clear differences in efficacy reported among the available agents.

Another relatively rare and little-known condition is retronychia.

According to Richert, trauma, circulatory disorders, and inappropriate footwear may disrupt onychomadesis. Instead of shedding, nail growth stops, and a new nail plate forms beneath the old plate, resulting in stacking of nail plates, irritation, and exudation. Although retronychia may resolve spontaneously, it can become chronic and dystrophic, producing a characteristic shrimp or lobster appearance. Treatment with topical corticosteroids or intralesional injections often leads to resolution.

In children, traumatic and infectious causes and ingrown nails are among the least frequent reasons for paediatric hospital consultations. The most common paediatric nail disorders, in descending order, are Beau's lines and onychomadesis, followed by trachyonychia, longitudinal melanonychia, and congenital nail malalignment.

Beau's lines, defined as transverse grooves of varying depth across the nail plate, and onychomadesis, defined as detachment of the nail plate from the nail matrix and nail bed, are associated with acute or severe medical events, such as fever, that slow or halt nail growth.

Trachyonychia is characterised by rough, longitudinally ridged, thin, and brittle nails.

Longitudinal melanonychia presents as pigmented bands. It may be functional but can also be associated with naevus or melanoma, warranting excision followed by histologic analysis.

Congenital nail malalignment represents one recognised aetiology of nail deviation, alongside acquired forms, often postsurgical, and hereditary pincer nails. Spontaneous resolution occurs in approximately 50% of affected children, supporting a watch-and-wait approach before considering surgery. Surgical realignment is effective at any age and severity, although it is a major procedure.

In all cases, Richert emphasised that paediatric nail disorders are most often benign and regress spontaneously or with mild conservative treatment.

Improper trimming at the nail edges may lead to the formation of a nail spike, sometimes described as a harpoon nail, which becomes inflamed and results in an ingrown nail. When persistent, the nail may tunnel through the surrounding tissue and reemerge distally.

Currently, there is no universal treatment approach for ingrown nails. Chemical matricectomy remains the reference standard. Phenol and trichloroacetic acid provide comparable outcomes, although phenol is associated with lower morbidity. When conservative measures fail, narrowing of the nail plate or excision of the surrounding soft tissue may be considered. These techniques allow intervention without damaging the nail plate, thereby reducing the risk for nail deformity. Other surgical approaches more readily sacrifice periungual soft tissue, including U-shaped excision around the nail.

Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common malignant tumour of the nail unit. Its slow progression often leads to delayed diagnosis. Conservative surgery with complete excision now yields favourable outcomes and is preferred, with amputation reserved for cases involving bone invasion. Approximately two thirds of these tumours are associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, particularly HPV 16. Infection occurs through genitodigital autoinoculation or partner-mediated transmission.

Longitudinal melanonychia should most often raise suspicion for nail melanoma. However, 20%-30% of nail melanomas are amelanotic. As Richert noted, a pink exophytic lesion of the nail apparatus should prompt a biopsy to avoid a missed diagnosis.

Other nail tumours also pose diagnostic challenges because clinical features may resemble benign conditions. Epithelial nail tumours include onychopapilloma, which is generally benign, and polydactylous onychopapilloma associated with a BAP1 mutation. The latter should prompt genetic counselling and evaluation for associated cutaneous melanoma, uveal melanoma, and mesothelioma.

Unexplained nail dystrophy that does not respond to initial treatment, pain, changes in nail plate colour, or involvement of periungual soft tissue can also be warning signs.

A landmark international study that pooled brain scans and memory tests from thousands of adults has shed new light on how structural brain changes are tied to memory decline as people age.

The findings - based on more than 10,000 MRI scans and over 13,000 memory assessments from 3,700 cognitively healthy adults across 13 studies - show that the connection between shrinking brain tissue and declining memory is nonlinear, stronger in older adults, and not solely driven by known Alzheimer's-associated genes like APOE ε4. This suggests that brain aging is more complex than previously thought, and that memory vulnerability reflects broad structural changes across multiple regions, not just isolated pathology.

Published in Nature Communications, the study, ""Vulnerability to memory decline in aging revealed by a mega-analysis of structural brain change,"" found that structural brain change associated with memory decline is widespread, rather than confined to a single region. While the hippocampus showed the strongest association between volume loss and declining memory performance, many other cortical and subcortical regions also demonstrated significant relationships. This suggests that cognitive decline in aging reflects a distributed macrostructural brain vulnerability, rather than deterioration in a few specific brain regions. The pattern across regions formed a gradient, with the hippocampus at the high end and progressively smaller but still meaningful effects across large portions of the brain.

Importantly, the relationship between regional brain atrophy and memory decline was not only variable across individuals but also highly nonlinear. Individuals with above-average rates of structural loss experienced disproportionately greater declines in memory, suggesting that once brain shrinkage reaches higher levels, cognitive consequences accelerate rather than progress evenly. This nonlinear pattern was consistent across multiple brain regions, reinforcing the conclusion that memory decline in cognitively healthy aging is linked to global and network-level structural changes, with the hippocampus playing a particularly sensitive role but not acting alone.

By integrating data across dozens of research cohorts, we now have the most detailed picture yet of how structural changes in the brain unfold with age and how they relate to memory.""

Alvaro Pascual-Leone, MD, PhD, senior scientist at the Hinda and Arthur Marcus Institute for Aging Research and medical director at the Deanna and Sidney Wolk Center for Memory Health

""Cognitive decline and memory loss are not simply the consequence of aging, but manifestations of individual predispositions and age-related processes enabling neurodegenerative processes and diseases. These results suggest that memory decline in aging is not just about one region or one gene - it reflects a broad biological vulnerability in brain structure that accumulates over decades. Understanding this can help researchers identify individuals at risk early, and develop more precise and personalized interventions that support cognitive health across the lifespan and prevent cognitive disability.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Fruit fly study identifies genes regulating dopamine and sleep","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260113/Fruit-fly-study-identifies-genes-regulating-dopamine-and-sleep.aspx","Tue, 13 Jan 2026 18:53:00 GMT","

Dopamine in the brain influences movement, learning, motivation and sleep. In humans, problems with dopamine are linked to conditions like Parkinson's disease, depression and sleep disorders. While scientists know a great deal about how dopamine works in the brain, they know less about how the body controls dopamine levels. Understanding this could help treat diseases where dopamine is disrupted.

In a new study published in iScience, researchers at Baylor College of Medicine and the Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Institute at Texas Children's Hospital (Duncan NRI) worked with the laboratory fruit fly to find new genes involved in regulating dopamine levels. The fruit fly is a powerful model to study brain function. Not only do flies and people share many genes, but also the flies' short life makes them ideal for large-scale experiments.

In addition to using dopamine to modulate brain activity just like humans do, flies use it to make melanin, the pigment that colors their outer shell. This suggested that changes in dopamine could show as changes in body color, a visible clue we could follow just by looking at these animals.""

Dr. Shinya Yamamoto, corresponding author, associate professor in the departments of molecular and human genetics and of neuroscience at Baylor and investigator at the Duncan NRI

The researchers used RNA interference (RNAi) – a technique that 'silences' specific genes – to screen hundreds of genes to see which ones altered pigmentation. Then, they checked whether those genes also changed dopamine levels in the brain and whether they influenced behaviors like sleep.

""We began by working with more than 450 genes that have been proposed to affect flies' body color. Using our gene-silencing technique, we confirmed 153 that consistently changed pigmentation,"" Yamamoto said. ""Interestingly, 85% of these genes are conserved in humans, and more than half are linked to neurological disorders such as autism, epilepsy and intellectual disability.""

Next, the team tested whether these pigmentation genes affected behavior. They measured movement and sleep patterns in flies in which these pigmentation genes were silenced in dopamine-producing neurons. Of the original 153 genes, 50 were linked to unusual locomotion or sleep, suggesting a possible role in brain function.

The researchers focused on 35 of these genes because they also were present in people and strongly affected pigmentation and behavior in flies. Eleven genes significantly changed dopamine levels, mostly reducing it. However, there was no clear link between flies' outer shell color and dopamine level, indicating that pigmentation is not a perfect proxy for dopamine.

""We then narrowed our study to two genes, mask and clu. Both genes reduced brain dopamine when silenced,"" Yamamoto said. ""Further experiments revealed that mask lowers dopamine by reducing the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, the key enzyme for dopamine synthesis. The clu gene also reduced dopamine, but through a different mechanism.""

Silencing mask changed sleep patterns in flies. Normally, flies anticipate light and become active before dawn. Flies lacking mask lost this 'light anticipation' and slept more during that period. Feeding these flies L-DOPA (a dopamine precursor) reversed the effect, confirming that the sleep changes were due to reduced dopamine. Silencing mask also blunted caffeine's wake-promoting effect, which depends on dopamine.

In contrast, silencing clu increased sleep but did not affect light anticipation, and its effects were not rescued by L-DOPA. This suggests clu influences dopamine indirectly.

By studying genes that affect cuticle pigmentation, the researchers were able to identify new genes, mask and clu, that are involved in regulating dopamine levels in the brain. The findings offer new possibilities to restore in people disruptions in dopamine that have been associated with neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, including addiction, depression, sleep disorders and schizophrenia.

A Stanford Medicine-led study finds a short-term, calorie-restrictive diet significantly improved symptoms.

""What should I eat?"" is perhaps the most common question patients with inflammatory bowel disease ask their doctors.

It's notoriously difficult to answer. There have been few large studies of dietary interventions for IBD, a group of disorders that includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.

Now, new research by Stanford Medicine investigators and their colleagues provides one potential answer. Their national, randomized controlled clinical trial found that a short-term, calorie-restrictive diet significantly improved both physical symptoms and biological indicators of mild-to-moderate Crohn's disease. The findings will be published Jan. 13 in Nature Medicine.

While dietary interventions are difficult to study - participants' reports of what they're eating aren't always accurate, and the placebo effect can't be avoided because participants know which diet they're on - the findings were notable, demonstrating significant declines in objective markers of inflammation in biologic samples alongside improvements in clinical symptoms. The study may help physicians guide patients in finding a diet that alleviates symptoms.

We have been very limited in what kind of dietary information we can provide patients. This study will give physicians evidence to support recommendations in an area that patients are very curious about.""

Sidhartha R. Sinha, MD, assistant professor of gastroenterology and hepatology and senior author on the paper

A chronic condition affecting about a million Americans, Crohn's disease causes inflammation in the digestive tract, leading to symptoms of diarrhea, cramping, abdominal pain and weight loss. Steroids are the only approved therapeutic for mild Crohn's, but their use is limited due to significant side effects, particularly with long-term use.

The study compared the symptoms and biological indicators of patients with mild-to-moderate Crohn's disease as they either followed a fasting mimicking diet or ate their normal diet for three consecutive months. The study enrolled 97 patients across the country, with 65 in the fasting mimicking group and 32 in the control group.

Participants in the fasting mimicking group severely limited their calories for five consecutive days per month, eating between about 700 and 1,100 calories a day, Sinha said. Plant-based meals were provided during the fasting period. For the remainder of the month, the fasting mimicking group ate their normal diet.

At the end of the study, about two-thirds of the fasting mimicking group experienced improvement in their symptoms. ""We were very pleasantly surprised that the majority of patients seemed to benefit from this diet,"" Sinha said. ""We noticed that even after just one FMD cycle, there were clinical benefits.""

In the control group, less than half experienced improvements in their symptoms. The improvement was likely a result of natural symptom fluctuations in Crohn's disease and because patients continued to follow their standard care regimens, such as taking medications.

Some participants in the fasting mimicking group experienced fatigue and headache, Sinha said, but no serious side effects were reported.

Sinha was inspired to study the fasting mimicking diet in patients with Crohn's disease after earlier research indicated the diet could reduce levels of C-reactive protein, a common marker of systemic inflammation in patients who had high baseline C-reactive protein levels. ""The effects seen on inflammatory markers made this an appealing diet to study in Crohn's disease since many patients with this disease also have elevated inflammatory markers,"" he said.

Along with tracking participants' clinical response and remission, the researchers also explored changes in biological specimens, such as shifts in common markers of inflammation in both stool and blood. ""Our goal in collecting these and other biospecimens was to dig deeper into why there's this differential response,"" Sinha said. ""Can we find mechanisms to explain the findings and signatures that might help predict patients who will respond to the diet?""

The researchers found a significant decline in fecal calprotectin, a protein in the stool that indicates gut inflammation, in the fasting mimicking group compared with the control group. Some inflammation-promoting lipid mediators derived from fatty acids also declined in fasting mimicking group participants. Similarly, the immune cells of fasting mimicking group participants produced fewer of several types of inflammatory molecules. The researchers are now exploring whether changes in the gut microbiome may also help explain some of the benefits of the fasting mimicking diet.

""There's still a lot more to be done to understand the biology behind how this and other diets work in patients with Crohn's disease,"" Sinha said.

The study's first authors are Stanford Medicine's Chiraag Kulkarni, MD, an instructor in gastroenterology and hepatology, and assistant clinical research coordinator Touran Fardeen.

Researchers from the University of Southern California and the University of California, San Francisco, contributed to the work.

Author Valter Longo, PhD, has equity interest in L-Nutra, the company from which the fasting mimicking meals were purchased and has filed patents related to the diet.

The U.S. Soccer Federation today announced that it has entered into a new strategic relationship with US Club Soccer as part of the organization's ongoing Pathways Strategy to make soccer more affordable, drive higher participation and produce more world-class players for its national teams. Under the terms of this managed services agreement (MSA), leading global sports, music, and entertainment company Wasserman, who previously managed US Club Soccer's internal operations, will enter into a new strategic partnership with US Soccer and U.S. Soccer will take over operational shared services of US Club Soccer's internal operations from Wasserman.

As part of this new agreement, U.S. Soccer will support US Club Soccer's core back-end operations, including HR, IT, and finance. This approach enables both organizations to focus on better support to clubs and leagues, participation growth, and affordability across the ecosystem. This management services agreement also reflects U.S. Soccer's commitment to building a system that works better for everyone in the soccer ecosystem and marks a natural next step in U.S. Soccer's broader Pathways Strategy.

Pathways is focused on three goals: lowering the cost of running soccer programs so more people can participate affordably; growing access and opportunity across all levels of the game; and improving the experience for players, coaches, parents, referees, leagues, and clubs to provide better, more accessible developmental opportunities.

""Our focus at U.S. Soccer has never been clearer - we exist in service to every player, coach, and referee in this country. And we know that people are seeking a youth soccer system that is more aligned, more transparent, more affordable, and easier to navigate,” said Dan Helfrich, Chief Operating Officer at the U.S. Soccer Federation. “This relationship with US Club Soccer is a critical first step toward making this happen, as they are a critical connector of clubs and leagues across the country. We will continue to pursue additional ways to accelerate our Pathways strategy and bring the US Way to life.

“This is a momentous time for our organization and the sport,” said Mike Cullina, CEO of US Club Soccer. “We've often told our staff, board and league partners: ‘If it's good for soccer, it's good for US Club Soccer.' The order of that statement is intentional; we've always considered ourselves as serving the sport first, trusting that by doing so – even structuring ourselves as such – that our organization will grow. This is a huge step forward in unifying soccer, and we appreciate the trust placed in the US Club Soccer team to serve the sport.”

Cullina is helping to lead the transition and will remain as CEO of US Club Soccer. For US Club Soccer staff, its thousands of clubs and leagues, and more than 800,000 annual participants nationwide, operations remain the same, with the added benefit of more direct access to U.S. Soccer's systems, expertise, and support.

U.S. Soccer is also engaging with other National Associations and members to explore managed services agreements and related areas of collaboration. These discussions are focused on improving coordination and supporting a more connected competitive environment aligned with the Pathways Strategy. U.S. Soccer will actively work with members interested in this new partnership model in the future.

LA NUCIA, Spain (Jan. 11, 2026) – The U.S. Under-17 Women's National Team drew 2-2 with Germany in the first of two friendly matches in Spain during its January training camp.

The United States scored first and it came when forward Maddie DiMaria played a through ball to forward Deus Stanislaus, who dribbled around German goalkeeper Mirja Kropp and slotted the ball in the back of the net.

The U.S. would make it 2-0 just before the end of the first half. After a German turnover in the midfield, Stanislaus passed to Amari Manning on the run. The midfielder sped down the left side before finishing to double the USA's lead in the 41st minute.

Unfortunately, the USA could not hold that lead despite peppering Germany with nine shots on goal and forcing seven saves over the course of the match, Germany struck just after the halftime kickoff. In the 46th minute, Clara Choisy intercepted a pass between U.S. defenders and buried Germany's first of the day.

Germany's Mia Kuhn then equalized in the 76th minute, ripping a shot from the top of the box which U.S. goalkeeper Avellina Saunders initially saved but Kuhn followed her rebound and knocked it home to tie the match.

The U.S. continued to push through the final whistle but neither team could find a game-winner.

Seventeen players named to this roster by U.S. U-17 WNT head coach Ciara Crinion were born in 2009, the birth year cut-off for players to be eligible for the 2026 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, which will be staged in Morocco. Midfielder Loradana Paletta was born in 2011 with midfielder Gigi Zuniga and Saunders born in 2010.

Seven players on the roster for the Spain trip helped the USA win the 2024 Concacaf Girls' U-15 Championship: forwards Carolina Reyna, DiMaria, Manning and Stanislaus, midfielders Mia Corona and Paletta, and goalkeeper Ella McNeal. That team was also coached by Ciara Crinion.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","Reign extend Laura Harvey's contract to 2028","https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/47599662/seattle-reign-extend-contract-coach-laura-harvey-2028","Tue, 13 Jan 2026 16:38:00 GMT","

Laura Harvey, the NWSL's winningest and most tenured coach, has signed a new contract to remain as head coach of Seattle Reign FC through the 2028 season.

Harvey is synonymous with the Reign, having coached the team in 10 of its 12 regular seasons to date, through multiple ownership and name changes and in-market relocation.

Harvey has been one of the few constants. Her continued presence on the sidelines with the Reign -- famously sitting on a watercooler, no doubt -- was widely assumed as such a given that the expiration of her previous contract came and went on Dec. 31 without any attention.

However, in an exclusive interview with ESPN, Harvey said that last season lit a fire in her that she hadn't felt since the league launched in 2013.

""Last year was one of the most fun years I've had as a coach,"" Harvey told ESPN. ""It was like this new era had come. I wasn't sure if I would ever feel that again. I think back to 2013 and 2014 and all the newness of what that felt like, and all the excitement around that.

""I didn't feel I'd ever have that again -- and I had it again last year. It was really fun turning up to work every day and working with the staff and the players was really, really fun. And that was credit to everybody involved in the environment we tried to create.""

Last year's turnaround -- a fifth-place finish and return to the playoffs -- took place in the first full season under the new joint ownership of MLS' Seattle Sounders and the Carlyle Group, which has injected a new sense of direction into the team after 18 months in limbo under previous ownership.

""When you sit and you hear and you see the work that people are doing behind the scenes to try and move the club forward, it makes you excited to see what that could be,"" Harvey said.

""Having put so much time and effort, and blood sweat and tears into this place, I didn't want that to be someone else's joy that they got. I want that to be something that I can continue to enjoy that journey with this newfound ownership and vision of what we want the club to look like in the future.""

Harvey's 113 victories as a head coach are the most in NWSL history. She has been named NWSL Coach of the Year three times and guided the Reign to three NWSL Shields since taking over as the team's first coach in the inaugural NWSL season in 2013.

Throughout her decade-plus in the NWSL, she has been one of the few female head coaches in the league, a trend she says she still wants to see corrected. Harvey left the Reign after the 2017 season to guide the expansion Utah Royals for two seasons before joining U.S. Soccer in 2020.

She returned as head coach of the Reign midway through 2021 as a stabilizing force when the league was in turmoil and the club had just removed former head coach Farid Benstiti.

The Reign franchise was also entering turbulent times off the field. OL Groupe put the team up for sale in early 2023.

Reign general manager Lesle Gallimore, who was hired that year, described those 18 months that followed as filled with uncertainty and ""chaos internally.""

Seattle still made it to the NWSL Championship in 2023 but finished second-bottom in 2024, conceding 44 goals in a miserable season matched only by the Reign's ill-fated launch 10 years earlier. The Reign lost USWNT veterans Rose Lavelle and Emily Sonnett among others as the team sat idle and cash-strapped during a winter transfer window while it waited for its new owners.

Last season, however, brought a revival: A return to the playoffs, where the Reign lost to the 2024 champion Orlando Pride in the quarterfinals.

Gallimore said the team's early-season success last year sparked contract renewal talks beginning in the summer.

""I have talked a lot about consistency and clarity and certainty,"" Gallimore said. ""And I think retaining Laura and moving forward and supporting her and her continued growth and development, but also someone that's a known leader and a known winner in the league with the experience that she has -- I'm looking around at all those clubs that I feel have struggled because of not having those things. Not having consistency, not having clarity, that's hurt those clubs. We don't want to be one of those. We want to be at the top consistently, competing consistently.""

Gallimore said that consistency should not be confused with complacency. Both she and Harvey separately said that the team's identity needs to continue to evolve -- especially offensively. Gallimore said that Harvey's staff has nearly doubled in size since 2023 to allow Harvey to focus fully on coaching. Harvey is most proud of the team's defensive resilience last year, having tightened things up to concede only 29 goals in 26 games.

But the Reign struggled to create goals, scoring just 32 -- worst among the eight playoff teams -- and finishing tied for the second worst expected goal (xG) difference in the league (-14.4).

Harvey said she ""hates"" xG as a metric used in a vacuum -- and acknowledges the irony after going viral for using ChatGPT, because she said she is not a data person -- but she knows that it indicates a trend, and that the team needs to create more scoring opportunities to improve.

That data, she said, shows they finish their chances when they get them, but they don't create enough.

""Adapt or die, really,"" Harvey said. ""I think that's the world that we live in. The world of women's football moves at a pace that is unrecognizable in a lot of sport. It moves so fast, the goalposts move a lot, and you've got to roll with that.""

Harvey's new contract will take her into the NWSL's 15th regular season, most of which she will have spent in Seattle. She joked that she might finally buy a house in the city after all this time.

That final missing piece for Harvey and the Reign, however, is an NWSL Championship, a trophy that eluded even the 2014 squad, which was one of the best in league history and one of the best in the world at the time.

For that reason, Harvey said, her job is not done.

""That's the elusive part for us,"" Harvey said. ""The legacy of the Reign has been to win, but the one thing we haven't won yet is that. That's the thing that obviously is at the top of everybody's mind.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","Fifa World Cup: What does president Donald Trump's foreign policy mean for USA 2026","https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c2051p7ej1vo","Tue, 13 Jan 2026 10:50:25 GMT","

Fifa president Gianni Infantino gave US president Donald Trump the inaugural Fifa Peace Prize in December

A group of cross-party MPs have called on Fifa to consider expelling the United States from the World Cup until the country demonstrates ""clear compliance with international law and respect for the sovereignty of other nations"".

It follows the seizure by US forces of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro in a raid on the capital city Caracas this month, along with warnings that US president Donald Trump has recently issued to a host of other countries.

So with the US due to host both the World Cup and Olympics over the next two and a half years, what questions does America's foreign policy raise for sports organisations, and could any take a stand?

Back in December, Fifa awarded Trump its inaugural 'Peace Prize' at the 2026 World Cup draw ceremony in Washington, saying he had ""played a pivotal role"" in establishing a ceasefire and promoted peace between Israel and Palestine, and that he has sought to end other conflicts.

In the few weeks since, the US has taken military action in both Venezuela and Nigeria and has hinted at possible further operations in Greenland, fellow World Cup co-host Mexico, and two other participants in the tournament - Colombia and Iran.

Now, 23 politicians from Labour, the Lib Dems, Green Party and Plaid Cymru have signed a motion, external in parliament, calling on international sporting bodies to consider expelling the US from major international competitions, including the World Cup. 

They say such events ""should not be used to legitimise or normalise violations of international law by powerful states"".

The MPs express concern about the ""escalation of US actions against Venezuela"", including ""the kidnapping of President Nicolas Maduro"", claiming that they amount to ""a direct intervention in the internal affairs of a sovereign state"".

Their motion also notes ""repeated veiled and overt threats made by senior US officials"", towards Denmark, Colombia and Cuba"", saying it ""undermines the rules-based international order"".

The United States launched a military strike on Venezuela and captured president Nicolas Maduro on 3 January

President Trump wins inaugural Fifa Peace Prize

Trump and Infantino - too close for comfort?

While the White House is yet to respond to the BBC about the MPs' motion, it has previously claimed that the capture of Maduro was a law-enforcement operation against an illegitimate leader responsible for both drug-trafficking and terrorism. Trump said the US will now control Venezuela and its oil industry.

Maduro insists he is a prisoner of war, and Trump faced strong criticism at an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council. 

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was ""deeply concerned that rules of international law have not been respected"" during the US action.

Meanwhile, Trump has also told Cuba to ""make a deal"" over Venezuelan oil exports ""before it is too late"", and said a military operation targeting Colombia ""sounds good"".

As with Venezuela, Trump has accused Colombia of not doing enough to tackle drug trafficking. Colombia president Gustavo Petro has told the BBC that he believes there is now a ""real threat"" of US military action against his country.

Trump has also claimed that drugs are ""pouring"" through Mexico into America, adding ""we're gonna have to do something"", amid reports that he has started planning a mission to send in US troops. 

Mexico president Claudia Sheinbaum says she has rejected any US military action on Mexican soil.

Trump has also insisted his country needs to take over Greenland for national security reasons and has not ruled out using military force. 

The mineral-rich Arctic territory is controlled by Denmark, a fellow Nato member, and potentially also in the World Cup if its team comes through the play-offs. 

The Trump administration has also faced mounting scrutiny over the legality of air strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and Eastern Pacific.

Gianni Infantino was elected president of Fifa in February 2016

Fifa declined to comment on the MPs' motion, and whether it may now reconsider the annual awarding of its peace prize in light of Trump's recent foreign policy.

But few believe it will take any action against a country that is hosting the majority of its matches at the World Cup, especially given the close relationship the governing body's president Gianni Infantino has cultivated with Trump.

Such ties have led to accusations that Fifa has become politicised, although it insists that as an organiser of football events it has a statutory duty to remain neutral. 

This is not the first time Fifa has come under pressure over the political actions of a World Cup host. 

In 2018, the tournament went ahead in Russia despite the country annexing Crimea four years earlier. Russia also stood accused of cyber attacks, meddling in western elections and carrying out the Novichok nerve agent attack in Salisbury.

However, comparisons have also been drawn with the way Fifa subsequently banned Russia after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, a sanction that remains in place.

""Let's have consistency,"" Brian Leishman, one of the MPs who has signed the motion, told the Daily Mirror when asked about the US action in Venezuela. 

""It's an invasion of a sovereign nation and the kidnap of a president in Venezuela. I'm very critical of Maduro, I want to be very clear on that, but what we've seen is a breach of international law. When you see how Russia has been treated, which is absolutely correct, I just want there to be consistency.""

Some at Fifa privately point out that the Russian Football Union is still a member association and that the ban on playing internationals was more down to teams refusing to play against Russia and security concerns, rather than the governing body taking a moral position.

An insight into Fifa's approach came in October when Infantino said Fifa ""cannot solve geopolitical problems"" amid pressure to sanction Israel after a United Nations commission of inquiry concluded that it had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.

Israel's foreign ministry said it categorically rejected the report, denouncing it as ""distorted and false"".

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) also maintains a ban on Russian teams at the Games, with individual athletes only allowed to compete as neutrals, as long as they are admitted by the relevant sporting federations.

However, it has ruled out the exclusion of any American athletes from February's Winter Olympics in Milan and Cortina in Italy.

In a statement issued to BBC Sport, it said: ""As a global organisation, the IOC has to manage a complex reality. The IOC has to deal with the current political context and the latest developments in the world. 

""The ability to bring athletes together, no matter where they come from, is fundamental to the future of values-based, truly global sport, which can give hope to the world.

""For this reason, the IOC cannot involve itself directly in political matters or conflicts between countries, as these fall outside our remit. This is the realm of politics.""

IOC sources have told BBC Sport a distinction has to be made with Russia because  it took over Ukrainian territory and put athletes there under the control of the Russian Olympic Committee, which is against the Olympic Charter.

Los Angeles is hosting the Olympics in 2028.

The 2026 World Cup will feature 48 teams for the first time

Some believe that, depending on Trump's next moves, the situation could become harder for sports bodies to navigate.

""Fifa and the IOC could be heading towards one almighty headache,"" according to John Zerafa, a veteran advisor to countries and cities wanting to host major sports events.

""Both organisations' charters emphasise peace, respect for sovereignty, and non-discrimination.

""In Russia's case, that led to bans and restrictions on athletes and teams. If, in a worst-case scenario, the US were to use force against Greenland - a Nato ally's territory - would those same principles apply? If Denmark qualifies via the play-offs, would it boycott the World Cup? Would European or Nato leaders refuse to attend US-hosted events?

""This isn't just geopolitics. It's a looming stress-test for sporting institutions that pride themselves on neutrality, yet repeatedly find themselves forced to take political positions when international law and conflict collide with global competition.""

Trump's hardline immigration policy could also have an impact on the World Cup, which begins on 11 June.

Fifa vowed to have a welcoming and unifying tournament, but there are now four competing countries - Iran, Haiti, Senegal and Ivory Coast - whose fans face full or partial travel bans, with the White House referencing a need to manage security threats.

Meanwhile, domestic tensions in the US have intensified after Renee Good, 37, was shot dead by an immigration agent in Minneapolis last week, triggering large protests in the city.

Even before the incident, human rights organisations had claimed the World Cup was at increasing danger of being ""weaponised for authoritarian aims"", external and criticised ""escalating attacks on immigrants in the US... and threats to press freedom and the rights of peaceful protesters"".

As Fifa's biggest-ever tournament approaches it will be fascinating to see what further impact US action overseas has on ticket sales, collaboration between the co-hosts on issues such as security, and whether sports bodies feel they need to do more to navigate a complicated geopolitical landscape.

ZURICH (AP) — FIFA deepened its commercial ties to the betting industry Monday in a four-year deal that will let some gambling operators livestream World Cup games this year.

The deal with data provider Stats Perform — with brands including soccer statistics specialist Opta — runs through 2029 for most FIFA competitions “to distribute official betting data and livestreams” to account holders.

“It also grants exclusive betting rights to thousands of matches per season across FIFA Member Association competitions powered by FIFA+,” the soccer body said, without stating the value of the deal.

The FIFA+ website — which shows games from some FIFA competitions and lower-ranked leagues plus highlights from much of the World Cup archive — has now teamed with Saudi Arabia-backed streaming network DAZN.

FIFA's commercial partnerships with the gambling industry are despite its code of ethics formally prohibiting players, officiala and agents from taking part in “either directly or indirectly, betting, gambling, lotteries or similar events or transactions related to football matches or competitions

FIFA's previous World Cup tie-in with gambling was a regional sponsor deal in Europe for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

Chicago-based Stats Perform said it will distribute FIFA betting data “to licensed sports betting operators for modeling, trading, settlement and in-play front-end use.”

Its Opta subsidiary will supply gambling industry clients with “official player statistics, insights, live scores and match trackers.”

The men's World Cup starts June 11 in Mexico City and will see 48 teams play 104 games across the United States, Canada and Mexico through July 19.

This article by Alberto Aceves originally appeared in the January 13, 2026 edition of La Jornada, Mexico's premier left wing daily newspaper.

The drums of protest and calls to boycott the 2026 FIFA World Cup are beating louder in the United States. Thousands of fans are expressing concern about the tournament's security, outrage over the armed attack in Venezuela, and the controversial human rights policies of the Donald Trump administration. According to European media, messages promoting ticket cancellations on resale forums, travel agencies, and hotel booking sites have not only prompted extraordinary meetings between officials and representatives of member associations, but have also generated discussions about potential strategies to address the shifting perceptions surrounding the tournament.

Since late last year, an informal group of international supporters created the website BoycottUSA2026.org in response to the violation of civil liberties of visitors from Australia, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and other European countries, who have been deported in various cities by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). “The U.S. government has revoked thousands of visas and denied entry to legal residents,” stated members of the group from New York, the host city of the World Cup final, which is being co-hosted by the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. “Participants must demand that FIFA prioritize the safety and rights of fans and players.”

Social media not only represents a space for grievances for the #BoycottFIFAWorldCup movement, but also a significant mobilization tool. The campaign is coordinated by users who utilize threads on X (formerly Twitter) and TikTok videos to expose the contradiction between sporting values ​​and a long history of violence and abuse ordered by President Donald Trump. “I canceled my World Cup tickets,” announced Lebanese diplomat Mohamad Safa, executive director of PVA Patriotic Vision—a non-governmental organization accredited as a consultant to the United Nations—on Thursday, fearing that ICE agents would consider him a dangerous individual due to his background.

Fan trips from around the world are being cancelled

“ICE can decide I'm a gang member and lock me up in prison for a year without charges, without a hearing, without a trial, without the right to consult a lawyer or make any phone calls. It's not safe to visit the United States,” Safa wrote, referring to the tightening of the U.S. government's immigration policies. “Threatening to revoke my U.S. visa in response to the World Cup boycott campaign won't change anything. Fans around the world are canceling their trips. FIFA expelled Russia from international football. Now it must do the same with Israel; the law applies equally to everyone.”

Although the governing body of soccer maintains that it cannot intervene in geopolitical issues due to a principle of neutrality—anti-immigrant raids, intervention in Venezuela, and Israel's genocide in the Gaza Strip, for example—in 2022 it acted swiftly to sanction Russia for its military intervention in Ukraine. The creators of the website BoycottUSA2026.org, based in New York—the host city of the tournament final on July 19—promote building a solidarity network among fans, supporters, journalists, and other organizations to “support the immigrant communities where we live” and provide resources on “how to act safely around law enforcement.”

“We must not allow these acts to become normalized.”

The voices of the collective and diplomat Mohamad Safa have also been linked to those of professors, content creators, and political activists, such as Ajamu Baraka, the 2016 US vice-presidential candidate, who has pointed out the potential human rights violations at the World Cup, fueled by FIFA's convenient ties to Donald Trump. “How can the United States be rewarded with hosting the World Cup, with its hands stained with Palestinian blood and an illegal attack on Venezuela? We must not allow these acts to become normalized. Postpone the matches, boycott the United States,” he wrote on his social media accounts on January 3.

On the nonprofit technology platform Action Network, dedicated to providing tools for progressive groups to mobilize their supporters, raise funds, and manage political campaigns, more than 3,240 people have launched an initiative urging FIFA and the International Olympic Committee to ban the United States and Israel from hosting or participating in international sporting events. “The world is witnessing massive violations of human rights and the U.S. Constitution as masked agents in unmarked vehicles raid workplaces, homes, and public squares to arrest people and deny them legal representation,” states the petition on actionnetwork.org.

President Sheinbaum's daily press conference, with comments on Mexican sovereignty, recovering public healthcare, re-socializing fertilizer production, cell-phone registration, audience rights, and Artificial Intelligence legislation.

President Claudia Sheinbaum reiterated that Mexico's and her government's position is enshrined in the Mexican Constitution, which establishes the principle of non-military intervention.

Xabi Alonso is gone, but Real Madrid's deeper problems remain. Did the club fail its coach - and can anyone truly manage this team?

Xabi Alonso was sacked on Monday afternoon, a decision that said as much about Real Madrid as it did about the coach himself. The man the club had courted for years ultimately never fit, not because of a lack of ideas, but because Madrid struggled to accommodate them. Alonso arrived with a clear footballing vision and left as the fall guy for a team still unsure how - or whether - it wants to be coached.

But here's the thing with Real Madrid: they subscribe to the theory of Galacitcismo. The players have always been - and will always be - bigger than the club. The current crop is no different. Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Jr, in particular, are wonderful footballers capable of carrying a team. But they don't fit into systems, and they are certainly reluctant to adapt to any sort of manager. Alonso may be an excellent coach, but he is not a man manager - not yet, at least. 

So, he was let go. In his stead, Madrid have promoted academy manager Alvaro Arbeloa. He, too, is a former Madridista who ""knows"" the club. Perhaps he can conjure a little more consistency out of an immensely talented yet problematic group. Only time will tell. But is any of this fair to Alonso? Did he need to be sacked? And can anyone coach this team? 

GOAL U.S. writers break down the state of Real Madrid in another edition of... The Rondo. 

Tom Hindle: Of course not. Managers deserve time, and all things considered, Alonso's results weren't all that bad. Sure, there were a couple draws and one or two losses, but they are four points back in La Liga and very much in the picture in the Champions League. Clasico losses sting that much is clear. Yet Alonso didn't have to go. Then again, would it have gotten any better? Not sure. 

Ryan Tolmich: Wild as it was Monday, probably? Alonso clearly never commanded the respect of the team's top stars and when that happens, a coach generally has to go. The thing is, though, that there may not be a coach in the world who can actually tame that locker room. Alonso was the fall guy this time, but most coaches would find themselves in the same spot when dealing with the authority level of the club's players.

TH: Trying to coach the lads who couldn't be coached. Madrid need a tactician, but they also need a vibes guy, a personality who can embody the concept of Madridismo. Sure, Alonso became successful by being a nerdy guy, but he needed to change his approach to make it work out in the Spanish capital. 

RT: Taking the job? It's easy to understand the allure of coaching the world's top stars at a club like Madrid, but the job is almost impossible even for the most experienced professionals. There's a reason that the club had to keep hiring and rehiring Ancelotti and Zidane for the better part of a decade: respect. There's just a lack of respect for coaches at that club, save for names of a certain level. Many thought Alonso's playing career gave him that type of name, but it doesn't appear so.

TH: Make no mistake, the players got the manager sacked here. Sure, Alonso should have changed, but it was the lack of effort from Mbappe, Vinicius and Co. that was his downfall. They needed to buy in - or at least show some basic respect for the head coach. If Alonso says give the opponent a guard of honor, for example, they should bloody do it. 

RT: It can be both. Alonso will likely look back at a few moments he regrets. There were some where he was likely too rigid and others where he was likely too loose. That happens to a young coach. He'll learn from it. The question is if the players will, too. Yes, it's good to have power, and it's important for players to have a say, but ultimately, the buck has to stop with the coach. There needs to be that central figure of power, and if that figure doesn't have that power, the whole thing splinters. The club will hope to find that central figure, one who can get everyone rowing in the same direction.

TH: Financially? No. But for the better of the club, one of them has to go. Vinicius probably makes the most sense, even if he does have the ""heir-apparent to Cristiano Ronaldo"" vibe going on. Madrid can cash in big, and he gets a fresh start. He's probably a better team guy than Mbappe, but the Frenchman reigns supreme here - fairly or not. 

RT: Do they have to? No. Should they? Probably, yeah. There's no shortage of attacking talent, and it's something of a waste to have so much money effectively tied up in two left wingers. Mbappe can play centrally, and he has, but that's not the best use of him. Would it not make more sense to turn one of those guys into an elite striker or midfielder or defender in transfer? Probably, but that's one of several things the club needs to address over the next year or so.

TH: No. No one is. This is an uncoachable club that needs a total overhaul. Any other team would realize that and act. Arbeloa perhaps has a slight leg up due to his experience in the academy, but it's otherwise an impossible job. He's the best of a poor group. 

RT: For now, sure. He knows the club well, understands the politics at play, and is seemingly well-regarded as a young head coach. That lack of experience, though, is hard to look past, particularly at a club like this. Hey, maybe he's the next Pep Guardiola, who rose from similar ashes at Barcelona, but, more than likely, the club is reassessing this spot fairly soon.

TH: Take your pick, Xabi. The manager is one of the best in Europe. That leaves options fairly open. You'd probably exclude Barcelona and Manchester United from that group due to past rivalries. Man City probably makes the most sense, especially if Pep Guardiola leaves at the end of the season. Also, Arne Slot's pits might have just gotten a bit sweatier in Liverpool. 

RT: Wherever he wants, basically. There will be no shortage of big clubs interested and, realistically, Spain could be, too, after the World Cup this summer. His exploits in Germany prove that he's a good coach who still needs one or two lessons to become great. Maybe Madrid was that lesson, and he'll be better for it. Some clubs will be eager to find out, for sure.

TH: No, he made the right choice. Mbappe has wanted to play for Madrid since he was a literal child, and he has the right to go where he wants - especially if a team is stupid enough to blow up their wage structure and chemistry to accommodate him. He had done all that he could have at PSG, who were far better as soon as he left. The question is: what happens now? He's 27 and hasn't really ever made a team markedly better. Unless he decides to buy in and fit into a system, he will just score loads of goals to no real effect. And to be honest, there is absolutely zero reason to sympathize with that. 

RT: Still TBD. Would PSG's Champions League success sting for him? Oh yeah but, on numbers, there's no way that Mbappe's move has been a failure. Those numbers include goals and, just as importantly, a whole lot of money and exposure that have taken him to a new level globally. Are there some sporting things to figure out? For sure, but given Mbappe's talent, you can bet on him figuring it out, even if it requires a few steps back to go forward.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

This is Legacy, GOAL's podcast and feature series tracking the countdown to the 2026 World Cup. Each week, we explore the stories and the spirit behind the nations that define the world's game. Today we look back at France '98; from the heartbreaks of Seville and Bulgaria to the night Zinedine Zidane lifted the trophy in Paris, this is the story of how France broke its curse and forged a winning identity that still defines Les Bleus today.

On July 12, 1998, France won far more than a trophy. They shattered a historical complex and forged a legend that endures to this day.

Before that date, French football was haunted by its demons. A founding force behind the world's greatest competitions, France embodied a cruel paradox: an influential nation that was rarely victorious, an inventor unable to master its own creation. Its identity had been shaped by a culture of ‘glorious defeat' – that nobility in failure which, over the years, had morphed into a genuine psychological burden. To grasp the seismic impact of 1998, one must understand the depth of the wound it healed, a scar born from three converging traumas.

The first remains etched in the collective memory as the ‘Seville tragedy' of 1982. That World Cup semi-final against West Germany stands as a painful legend. Harald Schumacher's assault on Patrick Battiston – leaving him unconscious with broken teeth and damaged vertebrae – was a flagrant injustice that went unpunished. The penalty shootout defeat, after leading 3-1 in an epic period of extra-time, forged the image within France of the ‘magnificent loser'. France's ‘magic square' of Michel Platini, Alain Giresse, Jean Tigana and Luis Fernandez produced the most beautiful football in the world, yet seemed too romantic, too fragile to triumph. Seville planted a pernicious notion that glorious defeat was preferable to victory without flair – a national narrative as poetic as it was paralysing.

The second trauma was one of pure humiliation, as the end of Platini's generation ushered in a catastrophic decade. France failed to qualify for Euro '88 or the 1990 World Cup, and were then eliminated without distinction from Euro '92. However, the national team endured its darkest night on November 17, 1993.

That evening at Parc des Princes, a simple draw against Bulgaria would have secured passage to the World Cup in the United States. But in the dying seconds, a devastating counter-attack finished by Emil Kostadinov shattered all hope. Defeat was no longer heroic – it exposed a mental capitulation, a pathetic incompetence. The myth of the ‘magnificent loser' evaporated, replaced by the ignominious tag of simply being ‘losers'.

Finally, the third trauma was that of a tainted victory. On 26 May, 1993, Marseille had proven that France could win by claiming the nation's first European Cup against the mighty AC Milan. This triumph, which should have served as a catalyst, was immediately corrupted by the VA-OM match-fixing scandal that involved Marseille and Valenciennes. Revelations of the rigged match between the pair led to Marseille being stripped of their domestic title and relegated.

Four pivotal moments thus marked this dark period: Seville 1982; the failure to qualify for the 1990 World Cup; Marseille's tarnished victory in 1993; and the cruel defeat to Bulgaria later that year, which confirmed the French inferiority complex. Hope proved short-lived, leaving a nation without a single moment of pure glory to cling to.

In 1998, then, France wasn't awaiting victory; it craved redemption, liberation from these spectres of the past. It needed an unquestionable triumph to erase the injustice, achieved with mastery to forget the incompetence, and carried by symbols of integrity to wash away the stain.

The 1998 World Cup acted as collective catharsis, a psychological liberation that ended decades of inferiority complex. In the aftermath of the final, the French press spoke of a ‘blue planet, entirely blue, the blue of France'.

The words chosen weren't those of simple sporting victory, but of rebirth. France, which had ‘prostrated itself' before Brazil, ‘the Gods of the game', had just demolished them 3-0. Historical anomaly had become the new reality.

This success ended France's ‘Poulidor Syndrome' – a reference to the celebrated French cyclist Raymond Poulidor who, despite his talent, always finished runner-up in major races without ever winning the Tour de France. This culture of eternal second place, of honourable failure, had stuck to French sport like a limpet. Victory in 1998 liberated a nation that had hidden behind the aesthetics of ‘beautiful football' to justify its defeats. Suddenly, winning mentality was no longer the preserve of the Germans or Italians. French football could finally embrace ambition without pretence. 

This liberation came through a profound break with the archetypes of the past. The 1998 team was neither the romantic, vulnerable squad of 1982, nor the arrogant, brittle group of 1993. Its primary strength, contrary to French tradition, was its iron defence. Conceding just two goals in seven matches – one from the penalty spot – they built their triumph on unshakeable solidity. Tactically, Aime Jacquet had constructed a fortress.

The heroes of the odyssey weren't just artists like Zinedine Zidane, but defenders like Lilian Thuram, who scored an improbable semi-final brace, or tireless workers like Didier Deschamps and Emmanuel Petit. By winning through discipline, rigour and pragmatism – qualities often derided by a press hungry for panache – France proved another path existed. They broke the curse not by imitating the past, but by rejecting it to forge a new winning identity.

The 1998 victory is inseparable from the rehabilitation of its architect, Jacquet. A national team manager who became a pariah, then national hero, his journey is that of a man who transformed hostility into fuel.

Before being carried in triumph, Jacquet had to fight a war alone against almost everyone, facing a media campaign of unprecedented violence. Led primarily by the newspaper L'Equipe, the criticism was systematic and personal. They reproached him for everything: his playing philosophy deemed timid, his selection choices – notably the exclusion of stars Eric Cantona and David Ginola – his provincial accent and his image as a ‘rough' man incapable of leading France to the summit.

The conflict erupted as the World Cup approached. When Jacquet announced a preliminary squad of 28 players, L'Equipe's front page screamed: ""And we're playing with 13?"" This attack symbolised the contempt of a certain media elite for a man they deemed outdated. Yet this campaign produced the opposite effect. A poll commissioned by the newspaper to discredit him revealed that 72 per cent of the French public had confidence in Jacquet, which begun a profound fracture between opinion-makers and popular sentiment. Jacquet, the man of provincial France, embodied values of hard work, silence and determination that resonated powerfully across the country.

Facing this storm, Jacquet's method was a model of leadership. He built a bubble to protect his squad from external attacks, while his management rested on meticulous planning where nothing was left to chance, direct and honest communication with his players, and unwavering loyalty to those who bought into his project. He promised injury-hit defender Bixente Lizarazu that he would wait for him, and kept his word. He made collective strength an obsession, a non-negotiable principle. Marcel Desailly would later summarise Jacquet's methods as educating his players ""with an iron fist in a velvet glove"".

The final victory, then, wasn't merely a sporting triumph, but resounding validation of Jacquet's vision. His famous declaration on the evening of July 12 – ""I will never forgive"" – wasn't just personal bitterness; it was an assertion that this title had been won against the experts' advice, and through the strength of a squad united in adversity.

Beyond the pitch, this victory sparked a cultural revolution within the French Football Federation (FFF). By proving a manager could succeed by resisting pressure and following a long-term vision, Jacquet made the position sacrosanct. He created a precedent that durably reinforced the authority and legitimacy of his successors, offering them unprecedented latitude. Deschamps, his heir, benefited from this consolidated power to impose his own bold choices, knowing that the 1998 victory had set in stone the principle that the national team manager is the sole man in charge.

The 1998 odyssey instantly transcended sport to become a societal phenomenon. The French team, composed of players from diverse origins – Thuram from Guadeloupe, Lizarazu from the Basque Country, Zidane from Algeria, Youri Djorkaeff from Armenia, and Desailly from Ghana – became the mirror of a France in full transformation. The slogan ‘Black-Blanc-Beur' (‘Black-White-Arab'), a play on the national flag's blue-white-red tricolour, imposed itself as the symbol of this unity in diversity. President Jacques Chirac himself hailed a ""tricolour and multicoloured team"" that presented a ""beautiful image of France and its humanity"".

This image of a reconciled France provoked popular fervour unseen since the Liberation. On the Champs-Elysees and throughout the country, millions of French people from all backgrounds celebrated together, creating a moment of national communion perceived as an antidote to social fracture. For many, this victory was living proof that the republican model of integration worked. It offered a powerful counter-narrative to the discourse of the National Front, the far-right party suddenly challenged on its own turf: patriotism. As sociologist Michelle Tribalat noted, ""the French team achieved more for integration than years of deliberate policies"".

However, this ‘World Cup effect' proved to be an enchanted interlude rather than lasting transformation. Once the euphoria passed, social tensions and discrimination didn't disappear. The ‘Black-Blanc-Beur' myth was criticised for masking French society's structural problems beneath a veneer of consensual celebration, and the 2005 urban riots, followed by heated debates on national identity, showed the limits of this sacred union. Twenty years later, the concept seems to belong to another era, a powerful memory tinged with nostalgia for a moment when football allowed France to dream of itself as a united and harmonious nation.

If the 1998 victory was a human exploit and social phenomenon, it was also the consecration of a structural revolution begun years earlier: French youth development. At the heart of this system lay the National Technical Centre Fernand-Sastre, better known as Clairefontaine.

Inaugurated in 1988 under the impetus of then-FFF president Fernand Sastre, this centre of excellence was destined to become French football's technical hub. The idea was to centralise the training of the country's best young talents and coaching staff, creating a common methodology and footballing philosophy.

The 1998 triumph served as a catalyst for French ambition in youth development. Though Clairefontaine, opened just 10 years earlier, hadn't yet provided the backbone of the world champion squad (Thierry Henry being its sole genuine representative), its existence already embodied the desire to structure a national model. Les Bleus' global success then gave this project considerable legitimacy and influence, making Clairefontaine a blueprint many nations would seek to emulate in subsequent years.

The most striking example came in Germany. Humiliated at Euro 2000 after a crushing defeat to Portugal, the German Football Federation (DFB) undertook a complete overhaul of its youth system. Seeking inspiration, its leaders turned to the French model, and a plan was presented to create a network of national training centres modelled on Clairefontaine, to better identify and develop young talent across the territory. This structural revolution, which required every professional club to establish a high-performance academy, bore fruit a decade later, culminating in Germany's 2014 World Cup victory.

France's 1998 triumph, then, didn't just change Les Bleus' destiny; it provided a blueprint that helped redefine global youth development standards, ensuring France an almost inexhaustible reservoir of talent for generations to come.

Beyond collective impact, 1998 radically transformed the footballer's status in France. Before that date, despite the popularity of players like Platini, footballers hadn't yet achieved cross-cultural icon status. The World Cup victory changed everything. Overnight, Zidane, Fabien Barthez, Djorkaeff and Lizarazu leapt from top-level sportsmen to national heroes, familiar figures anchored in the collective imagination.

Zidane embodies this metamorphosis better than anyone. Scorer of two headers in the final, he became ‘Zizou', the symbol of winning France. Zidane's face projected onto the Arc de Triomphe on victory night is a scene that marked history, consecrating him as a genuine national icon. From the northern districts of Marseille and the son of Algerian immigrants, he became living proof of success through talent and hard work, a role model for millions of youngsters. Zidane's aura transcended sport, making him one of the French people's favourite personalities for decades.

This status shift had a profound effect on society. Football, sometimes viewed with a certain condescension, became a respectable subject, even an object of study for intellectuals and a concern for politicians. Above all, this new generation of icons inspired vocations. In school playgrounds across France, children no longer simply dreamed of being firefighters or astronauts, but of scoring a goal in a World Cup final wearing the blue shirt.

These new superstars definitively installed football as the country's premier sport, creating unprecedented appeal and motivation for younger generations, who grew up certain that becoming world champions was not only possible, but a destiny within their grasp.

The 1998 legacy isn't measured solely in trophies or memories; it's transmitted directly, almost organically, through the men who forged it. The most evident and enduring lineage is that linking Jacquet to his captain, Deschamps.

On the pitch, Deschamps was Jacquet's relay, his brain, the one who translated his tactical vision into action. Twenty years later, having become manager, he appeared as his mentor's natural heir, the continuation of a philosophy that was proven to work at the highest level.

The similarities between the two men are striking. Both share the same conception of football, founded on pragmatism, the primacy of collective over individuals, and an obsession with defensive solidity. Like Jacquet, Deschamps has often been criticised for less-than-spectacular performances, yet his formidable efficiency has silenced sceptics.

Their relationship with the media is equally similar: controlled, distant, sometimes abrasive communication, aimed above all at protecting the squad from external pressure. Jacquet himself acknowledged this kinship: ""It would be presumptuous to say he's my spiritual son. I think we surely have, modestly, more or less the same trajectory, the same philosophy of football and life"".

This continuity manifested itself brilliantly during the 2018 World Cup. Deschamps' France, like Jacquet's, wasn't the tournament's most flamboyant team, but it was the most solid, tactically intelligent and united. Building success on a compact defensive block and rapid counter-attacks, Deschamps applied the lessons of 1998. He proved that Jacquet's legacy wasn't merely a memory, but a management method and winning culture that was still entirely relevant.

By becoming the third man in history to win the World Cup as both player and manager, Didier Deschamps didn't just write his own legend; he ensured the perpetuity of 1998's legacy, transforming it into genuine DNA for the French national team.

France's 1998 triumph wasn't a historical accident. It acted as a detonator, profoundly transforming French football culture. Before that date, France was a nation that hoped; afterwards, it became a nation that demands. Victory ceased being a dream to become a standard, instilling a winning mentality transmitted from generation to generation.

The most immediate proof came at Euro 2000. Carried by the same core, France achieved a historic double, installing itself durably at the summit of world football. Even in difficult moments, the 1998 legacy served as reference. Their appearance in three subsequent World Cup finals, in 2006, 2018 and 2022, demonstrates that France now belongs to the very exclusive circle of nations capable of performing at the highest level with exceptional regularity.

The most direct link remains the one leading to the second star in 2018. Twenty years on, a new generation, coached by the 1998 captain, repeated the feat. The young players, from Kylian Mbappe to Antoine Griezmann, grew up watching Zidane and Thuram's exploits. For them, being world champions wasn't fantasy, but tangible objective. The 1998 victory became what historian Pierre Nora calls a ""site of memory"" – an event of such emotional charge that it structures a community's identity.

More than a quarter-century later, the echo of July 12, 1998, still resonates with undiminished force. It's not simply a glorious chapter of the past, but a compass that continues guiding French football's future. The team that presents itself in North America in 2026 will carry within it the memory of Zidane lifting the cup at the Stade de France, not as a burden, but as inspiration. Because since 1998, the blue shirt is no longer merely a symbol of the nation – it's become a promise of glory.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Tatjana Maria defeats Venus Williams in a historic match at the Hobart International, showcasing her slice-centered game in windy conditions. Maria's win over 45-year-old Williams came after a tough loss to 17-year-old Emerson Jones in Brisbane.

Germany's Tatjana Maria defeated Venus Williams 6-4, 6-3 on Tuesday in the first round of the Hobart International, a match that carried historic weight on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz.

Hobart: Scores | Draws | Order of play

The first career meeting between the two produced the oldest combined age in a WTA Tour match since the circuit's founding in 1973, with Maria competing at 38 and Williams at 45. The mother of two broke serve five times in the 1-hour, 27-minute victory, using her slice-heavy game to full effect in windy conditions on Day 2 of main-draw play in Tasmania.

The win marked Maria's first of the season, coming one week after she was upset by 17-year-old Emerson Jones in the opening round of the Brisbane International -- a result that may have landed less comfortably at home, given that Williams is one of the favorite players of Maria's daughters, Charlotte, 12, and Cecilia, 4.

Maria joked afterward the girls profess the former World No. 1 to be one of their favorite players -- though she hoped they were rooting for her.

""Everybody loves Venus -- I love her too!"" said Maria, who makes her family home near Williams in Florida. ""For me, to play her was such an honor because I never played her before. It was not easy with all the wind but it was amazing.""

Maria's win capped what proved to be a difficult day for the two major champions that featured on Hobart's order of play.

Earlier, Barbora Krejcikova was slowed by knee trouble in a 2-hour and 32-minute contest against Peyton Stearns -- the American's first victory since the US Open. The Czech received a medical timeout after the first set and carried on admirably over an eventual 6-4, 1-6, 7-6(3) defeat.

Stearns served for the match twice in the final set, and missed two match points, before she converted her third chance for victory in the tiebreak. 

Other winners on Day 2 in Hobart included third seed Iva Jovic, who like Bondar won the first 11 games of her 6-0, 6-1 romp against Indonesia's Janice Tjen, Magdalena Frech, who pulled away in a 6-4, 6-0 win over France's Elsa Jacquemot; and Slovakia's Rebecca Sramkova, a three-set winner against Jacquemot's countrywoman Varvara Gracheva.

However, No. 1 seed Emma Raducanu's opener against Camila Osorio was rained off with the Briton leading 6-3, 2-4, deuce. Raducanu's solidity had seen her take the first set over the less consistent Osorio, but the Colombian hit her stride to take a 4-1 lead in the second set.

After two short pauses for drizzle, the first extended off-court delay came as Raducanu served at 4-2, 15-30 in the second set. On resumption, the pair managed to play only three points -- all ended with clean winners -- before play was called for the day.

How drivers will adapt in 2026

Moments that made us laugh and cry in 2025

F1.com takes a look back at a selection of standout F1 car launches from years gone by.

F1 will soon head into another launch season – and not only that, but an all-new era of regulations. As we patiently wait for teams to pull the covers off their 2026 designs, it seems like the perfect moment to revisit some of the boldest and most memorable reveals from years gone by...

We begin with the worlds of pop music and F1 colliding in spectacular style back in 1997, thanks to McLaren calling on pop star sensations the Spice Girls to help launch their car for the new season. When 2 Become 1, you could say…

Introducing a new title partnership and livery, McLaren were keen to make their mark and combined pulling the wraps off the MP4-12 challenger with a special performance from the band everyone was talking about at the time.

Cue the music, some bewildered expressions from team mates Mika Hakkinen and David Coulthard, an awkward question and answer session and a whole lot of glitz and glamour – it was certainly a memorable way to start the year.

F1 newcomers BAR initially confused the waiting media when they placed not one but two cars under wraps ahead of their 1999 reveal, but it soon became clear what was going on when drivers Jacques Villeneuve and Ricardo Zonta arrived.

BAR's backers, British American Tobacco, had seen an opportunity to advertise a couple of their brands in Lucky Strike and 555, leading to one white, red and black livery presented by Villeneuve and another blue and yellow design unveiled by Zonta.

However, they were forced to rethink those plans when the FIA intervened and stated that each team's cars should look almost identical, leading to an unusual solution of a split Lucky Strike/555 colour scheme – separated by a zip down the middle.

Eddie Jordan landed another sponsorship coup for his eponymous F1 team by signing a deal with DHL ahead of the 2002 campaign, prompting a pre-season visit to the logistics specialist's main hanger at Brussels Airport just outside the Belgian capital.

With the presentations under way, the control tower announced that a special delivery had arrived for Jordan's team boss, followed by a video showing a DHL-liveried Airbus A300 flying past and the hangar doors then opening to let the plane in.

Carefully unloaded from a side door and unboxed for the gathered journalists? Jordan's new F1 car, the bright yellow EJ12, which was soon on the move again thanks to the fast-approaching Australian Grand Prix to kick off the season.

“I think you'll find what's underneath this cloth quite dramatic,” commented Honda's F1 CEO Nick Fry with a smile, just before Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello combined to pull the wraps off one of the most unusual-looking cars in the sport's history.

Indeed, with support from their partners in adopting an almost logo-free contender, Honda's RA107 modelled a map of the world from front to rear – raising eyebrows among the press who had made their way to the launch at London's Natural History Museum.

It was an important message under Honda's ‘Earth Dream' initiative, which drew attention to the world's changing climate, but as summarised by F1.com writer David Tremayne, in a dreadful season “the car performed about as well as it looked”.

There's a common theme with the launch events mentioned above in that they all involved (at least) one fully built car being shown off, but in 2011, McLaren felt it would be more interesting to put their new challenger together in real time.

In a gathering at Berlin's Potsdamer Platz, prize winners and fans brought various car parts to waiting mechanics, who duly fitted them to the MP4-26, with Button then adding the steering wheel and team mate Lewis Hamilton the head rest.

Button and Hamilton would win three races apiece in the car they helped build, including the former's stunning last-to-first performance at the Canadian Grand Prix, which remains the longest race in F1 history at more than four hours.

For the 2025 season, F1 took things to a whole new level, marking the sport's 75th anniversary with a spectacular launch show – featuring every team and driver on the grid – live at London's The O2.

From host Jack Whitehall roasting F1's biggest stars to big-name musical performances, and a host of celebrity guests to the varied livery reveals themselves, it was an unforgettable evening for everyone involved.

“I think that has been a great success,” F1 President and CEO Stefano Domenicali said of F1 75 Live. “Showing the platform, also to convince the more sceptical ones, that F1 has to think big.”

The 25-year-old breakout star spoke with the late night host about the HBO Max-Crave series, what it was like learning how to skate and speak Russian and how he's coping with his sudden fame.

Heated Rivalry breakout Connor Storrie made his late night television debut Monday night with an appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers. 


	The 25-year-old actor — in the midst of a meteoric rise alongside co-star Hudson Williams following the release of the Canadian queer hockey series — sat down for a chat with Meyers about the whirlwind of the last month and change. He started his appearance by taking it all in, smiling out at the cheering audience. 




	Just last night, Storrie was in Beverly Hills at the 2026 Golden Globes, managing to become the talk of the town despite not even being nominated at the awards show. He told Meyers, who commented about the actor's quick turnaround to make the show, that he left the Globes around 8 p.m., went to the Chateau Marmont for about 30 minutes to attend an after party (which included snapping a photo with Parker Posey) and then rushed off to catch a flight.

					'Heated Rivalry' Costume Designer Talks Creating Style for Steamy Gay Hockey Drama: ""It's a Little Bit Queer Coded""  		
			









	As he has noted in previous interviews, Storrie spoke with Meyers about the wide appeal of the show and the queer romance genre in general. “You think of male romance, you think it's for gay men but there's been all walks of life, predominately women, who enjoy it,” he said, smiling out at the cheering audience. 


	Storrie told Meyers that the “jock-ness” of his role was the “craziest” part of the series. Meyers joked that the camera will cut away from different parts of the show — the hockey and the sex (or the “other thing,” as Meyers put it). “I do the other thing. I don't do the skating,” Storrie joked.

	“I'm going to be honest with you. I thought I was doing good and then recently one of our costume designers Hanna posted BTS of me skating,” Storrie recalled when asked if he felt better about his skating abilities. “I watched it and I was like, ‘Oh, boy. I don't deserve any accolades for this.”

	











	Meyers also spoke with Storrie about the exposure the show has given him. The actor reiterated how grateful he was for the experience, sharing he had been a waiter before he took the role. “If Heated Rivalry didn't go this well, I was already planning on getting a new job in a few months,” he admitted. 


	“To be able to act and get paid to do what I want to do and have enough money to film my own things, it's insane for me,” he said. His “own things” is likely a reference to his directorial debut, which he's been enthusiastically sharing about during Heated Rivalry's press tour. 


	The show had teased the interview with a parody of the show, showing Meyers trying to convince Storrie to come on Late Night and ending with a riff on Storrie's now-iconic cottage line. “I'm coming to Late Night,” Storrie said in his character Ilya's Russian accent. 


	The excitement for Storrie on Late Night began well before the actor spoke with Meyers. A large crowd gathered in front of NBC's 30 Rockefeller Center to get a peek at the actor arriving for his taping. It was a similar scene last week when Williams made his late night debut on The Tonight Show.

Heated Rivalry, hailing from Canadian streamer Crave and airing on HBO Max in the U.S., was created for television by Letterkenny alum Jacob Tierney and centers around a fictional hockey universe based on books by Rachel Reid. The show focuses on two rival professional players — Canada-born Shane Hollander (Williams) of the fictitious Montreal Metros and Russia-born Ilya Rozanov (Storrie) of the fictitious Boston Raiders — as they navigate a near-decade-long situationship turned (spoiler alert) relationship over the entirety of their Major League Hockey careers.

	











	Crave renewed Heated Rivalry for a second season and HBO Max confirmed it will continue to air the series. Tierney, who wrote and directed the show's entire first season, has confirmed that he'll return to direct the series, but told THR ahead of Heated Rivalry's finale that he was considering the possibility “that other writers will come in to help” him out, but that he wasn't sure yet.

There's no stopping Hollanov's momentum.

Heated Rivalry, the wildly popular queer hockey drama starring Connor Storrie and Hudson Williams, has taken the world by storm since its premiere in November. The Justin Tierney-helmed Crave original (which airs on HBO Max in the states) has garnered hundreds of thousands of fans who have fallen in love with the show's synchs and score, and they'll soon be able to stream its official soundtrack, Billboard can exclusively confirm.

	











	The Heated Rivalry original series soundtrack, crafted by show composer Peter Peter, will arrive on all platforms via Milan Records on Friday (Jan. 16). Fans can stream the set's first two singles — the high-octane “Rivalry” and the tender “It's You” — everywhere right now. Billboard can also confirm that a vinyl edition is in the works.


	“From the first day I started writing the show, I knew music would be as integral to the series as the actors themselves, and Peter's work was what I had on repeat,” Tierney tells Billboard. “His original score doesn't just sit underneath the story; it carries the emotion, the rhythm and the pulse of the show. I honestly can't imagine this series without it. Peter's music is completely woven into what the show is and how the story comes alive on screen.”


	Curated to reflect both the intensity of the professional hockey world and the techno undertones of Russian nightclubs, the Heated Rivalry score traces the evolution of the leads' romance as much as it reflects the passing of time throughout the show's blockbuster first season. Just as important are the show's music synchs, which include euphoric selections such as t.A.T.u.'s seminal “All the Things She Said.” Thanks to the series' rabid fandom and Tierney's poignant direction, those synchs have received astronomical streaming boosts, as reported by Billboard.

	











	“The music I composed for Heated Rivalry uncovered a side of me I wasn't certain I possessed, yet one I had always quietly wished was there,” Peter reflects to Billboard. “I'd never allowed myself such latitude in composition before. Jacob and [author] Rachel [Reid, who penned the book Game Changers on which the show is based] deserved the very best of me, so I gave them every ray of light I had.”

""If there are any MAGA left after THIS, you have made an irrevocable choice,"" the rocker wrote.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



Tom Morello is once again giving the Donald Trump administration heat, this time for using an alleged Nazi slogan at a recent news conference.


	Sharing an Instagram photo on Monday (Jan. 12) of U.S. Department of Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem addressing press a few days ago, the Rage Against the Machine musician (who also performs as The Nightwatchman) accused her of standing behind a podium that displayed a “verbatim” quote of a “Nazi mass murder slogan” on the front. The exact phrase printed on the podium was, “One of ours, all of yours.”


	“Coined when an SS officer was killed and the Nazis murdered every male resident of the village in response,” Morello claimed. “If there are any MAGA left after THIS, you have made an irrevocable choice.”

	











	The rocker also included a picture of himself at a show with a “F— Trump” poster taped to the back of his guitar and a screenshot of a quote from Ernest Hemingway's Spanish Civil War novel, For Whom the Bell Tolls: “There are many who do not know they are fascists but will find it out when the time comes.”


	When reached by Billboard for comment, the Department of Homeland Security responded: “Calling everything you dislike ‘Nazi propaganda' is tiresome. DHS will continue to use all tools to communicate with the American people and keep them informed on our historic effort to Make America Safe Again.”


Billboard has also reached out to the White House for comment.

	











	The SS, or Schutzstaffel, were a collective in Nazi Germany that “assumed leading responsibility for security, identification of ethnicity, settlement and population policy” and oversaw the horrific concentration camp system in 1933-34, according to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. The SS, which Hitler used as his personal bodyguard, was a leading force in the genocide of six million Jews during the Holocaust. Billboard has reached out to the museum for more information on whether “One of ours, all of yours” originated as Morello claims it did.


	The conference at which Noem stood behind a podium reading the statement took place on Jan. 8, one day after ICE officer Jonathan Ross shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, an unarmed U.S. citizen, during an immigration enforcement operation in Minneapolis. The incident has sparked a wave of outrage and anti-ICE sentiment across the country, while the DHS and Trump have maintained that Ross was acting in self-defense.


	Morello has long been unwavering in his opposition to both ICE and the twice-impeached POTUS, releasing protest song “Pretend You Remember Me” in July in response to the Trump administration's ongoing immigration enforcement raids. “Releasing this song now is in direct response to what we've seen happening, the state terror we've seen happening in this country of mass agents tearing families apart,” he told Billboard at the time.


	Though Rage officially disbanded in January 2024, the band was known for protesting oppressive systems of power through music. Rage Against the Machine topped the Billboard 200 twice (with Evil Empire in 1996 and The Battle of Los Angeles in 1999), won two Grammys, was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2023 and was saluted as one of the 50 Best Rock Bands of All Time on a Billboard staff list in 2025.


EDITOR'S NOTE: This story has been updated with a comment from the Department of Homeland Security.

Trevor Noah will be back for one last go-round as host of the Grammy Awards, CBS said Tuesday. The Emmy-winning, and Grammy-nominated comedian will return for his sixth and final time as host and also will serve as executive producer for the February 1 ceremony in Los Angeles.


	Noah began hosting the Grammys in a corporate synergy move while he was the host of The Daily Show on CBS' Paramount sibling Comedy Central. He continued to serve as host and executive producer after leaving The Daily Show in December 2022.


	2026 will be the last time the Grammy Awards will air on CBS, where it has aired every year since 1973. Beginning next year, the show moves to ABC as part of the Grammys' 10-year deal with Disney, which was announced last year. The Grammys will air on ABC, Hulu and Disney+ from 2027, taking it through to 2036.

	“I am beyond thrilled to welcome Trevor Noah back to host the Grammys for his sixth, and sadly, final time,” said Grammys executive producer Ben Winston in a statement. “He's been the most phenomenal host of the show. He's so smart, so funny, and such a true fan of the artists and music. His impact on the show has been truly spectacular, and we can't wait to do it together one last time.” 


	The Grammy Awards will air live from L.A.'s Crypto.com Arena at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. ET on Sunday, February 1, on CBS and stream live and on-demand on Paramount+.

	











	A winner of 22 career Grammys, Kendrick Lamar leads the 2026 nominations with nine, including Record, Song and Album of the Year. Lady Gaga received seven noms for her album Mayhem, followed by Sabrina Carpenter and Bad Bunny with six, all nominated as well in the major categories.


	In Record of the Year, Bad Bunny, Gaga, Carpenter and Lamar will compete against Doechii's “Anxiety,” Billie Eilish's “Wildflower,” Chappell Roan‘s “The Subway” and Rosé and Bruno Mars' “APT.”


	The 68th Grammy Awards will be produced by Winston's Fulwell Entertainment for The Recording Academy. Winston, Raj Kapoor, Jesse Collins and Noah are executive producers.

Avatar: Fire and Ash dominated the 2026 VES Awards nominations, which the Visual Effects Society revealed this morning. You were expecting anything else?


	James Cameron's blockbuster threequel from 20th Century Studios will vie in eight of the 23 categories and against itself in two of them: Outstanding Compositing & Lighting in a Feature and the Emerging Technology Award. It's familiar territory for Na'vi and the humans: The original 2009 Avatar won six VES Awards on 11 nominations, and 2022's Avatar: The Way of Water scooped nine wins on a record 14 noms. Both went on to take the Visual Effects Oscar for the same quartet of Joe Letteri, Stephen Rosenbaum, Richard Baneham and Andrew R. Jones.

	











Fire and Ash — which has grossed more than $1.23 billion worldwide in less than a month in theaters — will battle for the marquee Outstanding Visual Effects in a Photoreal Feature prize against Apple Original Films' F1 and The Lost Bus and Universal's Jurassic World: Rebirth and How to Train Your Dragon.

	Elsewhere, a trio of toons — Sony Pictures Animation's KPop Demon Hunters, Disney/Pixar's Elio and Walt Disney Studios' Zootopia 2 — drew five nominations each, followed by Apple Original Films' The Lost Bus with four.


	The VES Awards and Movie Academy haven't followed the same script much during the past decade-plus, with only five of winners of the top VES prize going on to score the FX Oscar since 2013. That trend held last year, when Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes won Outstanding Visual Effects in a Photoreal Feature — though it was the pic's only win on six nominations — but Dune: Part Two went on to claim Best Visual Effects at the Academy Awards. Denis Villeneuve's sequel did, however, lead the live-action film field with four wins at the 2025 VES Awards.

	











RELATED: The 2026 Oscars: Everything We Know About The Ceremony, Host, Date & More So Far


	The top TV nominees are Netflix's just-wrapped Stranger Things, HBO's The Last of Us and Apple TV/BBC Studios' Prehistoric Planet: Ice Age with four VES noms each.


	The VES Awards recognize outstanding visual effects artistry and innovation in features, animation, television, commercials, games and new media. The 24th annual ceremony is set for February 25 at the Beverly Hilton. The Sklar Brothers will host the event for a second consecutive year.


	“Visual effects artists and producers are at the forefront of cinematic artistry and technological innovation, whether their work is being seen on the big screen in a movie theater, on the device in your pocket or in a special venue setting,” VES Board Chair Kim Davidson said.

The “Heated Rivalry” buzz isn't cooling down anytime soon.

Just a day after he presented an award at the Golden Globes with co-star Hudson Williams, Connor Storrie is achieving another career milestone: making his late-night debut on “Late Night with Seth Meyers.”

Both stars have been having a huge 2026 so far, as the Canadian hockey romance series is currently one of HBO Max's most-watched shows.

And given Williams' first late night appearance last week — on “The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon” — generated headlines for days, fans won't want to miss Storrie's first solo talk show sit-down either. Read on for everything you need to know to stream it for free.

The breakout star is technically appearing on the talk show early in the morning on Jan. 13, 2026, as Meyers' show always begins at 12:35 am ET.

If you don't have cable, you'll need a live TV streaming service to stream Connor Storrie's appearance on “Late Night with Seth Meyers” for free. One option we love is DIRECTV, which comes with a five-day free trial, after which it starts at $49.99/month. There are plenty of subscription options and genre packs that include NBC.

You can also watch “Late Night with Seth Meyers” live for free with a Peacock Premium Plus seven-day free trial (after which it's $16.99/month).

If you missed Williams' late night debut last week, you can stream the full episode with any Peacock plan (starting at $7.99/month).

Timothée Chalamet is “Dune” too much, according to Chelsea Handler.

The comedian blasted Chalamet's “Marty Supreme” press tour on the “Not Skinny But Not Fat” podcast Tuesday.

When host Amanda Hirsch asked whether the actor took promotion “too seriously,” Handler agreed, “It seems so.”

The former “Chelsea Lately” host, 50, explained, “He seemed pretty serious about winning and getting acknowledged for his great acting.”

While Handler clarified she does believe Chalamet, 30, is “a great actor,” she noted, “It's hard to hear someone talk about how great they are at acting.”

Hirsch, 37, chimed in to say Leonardo DiCaprio is her “gold star” when it comes to acting like a “real movie star” in Hollywood — and the Oscar winner would never brag about his performance.

“Leo wouldn't say that,” Hirsch claimed. “Even though it took him so long to win, right? He didn't win anything until that wrestling with the bear movie [‘The Revenant'].”

Handler replied, “Leo wouldn't do that. Leo is a movie star. He wouldn't talk like that. That's new. I haven't heard any actor kind of talk like that.”

Hirsch speculated that Chalamet may have been going the “method” route and acting like his character, table tennis champion Marty Reisman, in interviews.

“That would be my only excuse for me,” she noted.

Elsewhere in the episode, Hirsch and Handler discussed Chalamet declaring his love for girlfriend Kylie Jenner during his acceptance speech at the Critics' Choice Awards 2026.

The comedian, who hosted the Jan. 4 awards show, said, “I don't understand what that situation is. Is that a real situation? Are they in love? Are they a couple?”

After Hirsch explained why Chalamet's public shoutout was a major deal for fans, she brought up one particular line in his speech, “I couldn't do this without you.”

Handler called this “ridiculous” and “stupid” because “obviously he could do [his career] without” Jenner.

She shrugged off the excitement surrounding the couple, saying, “I don't know what's f–king going on with these people, OK?”

Chalamet — who has been dating Jenner, 28, since 2023 — mentioned the makeup mogul again when he took home a Golden Globe over the weekend.

“To my parents and my partner, I love you. Thank you so much,” he said after winning in the best actor in a motion picture — musical or comedy category on Sunday.

The “Beautiful Boy” star also addressed his past losses, saying, “[Gratitude] has allowed me to leave this ceremony in the past empty-handed, head held high, grateful just to be here. But I would be lying if I didn't say those moments didn't make this one that much sweeter.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","The Fantastic Four's The Thing visits Wakanda in latest Avengers: Doomsday teaser","https://www.avclub.com/avengers-doomsday-teaser-fantastic-four-wakanda","Tue, 13 Jan 2026 18:08:37 GMT","

The promo campaign that began in earnest with a five-hour livestream of mostly-empty chairs continues to be extremely drawn out. This morning, Marvel shared its fourth teaser for Avengers: Doomsday in as many weeks, this time uniting the Fantastic Four with apparently the entire nation of Wakanda. Yes, it's Shuri (Letitia Wright) doing the voiceover and King M'Baku (Winston Duke) shaking the hands, but the gang's all here. As the teaser concludes, “The Wakandans and The Fantastic Four Will Return In Avengers: Doomsday.” 



Also returning, apparently is Namor (Tenoch Huerta Mejía) who made his MCU debut in 2022's Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. The only one of The Fantastic Four to show up in the clip is The Thing (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) who pulls a classic New Yorker move of introducing himself based on the streets he lives between. 

=Wright has teased the slightest bit about her role in Doomsday before. “It's just an ensemble of greatness, so I was just really excited to just be a part of it,” the actor said in June (via ComicBookMovie.Com) “I've been a part of it before, but in a smaller way. Now, I have a little bit more.” And that is probably about the extent of what Marvel will allow her to say before Avengers: Doomsday arrives in theaters on December 18, 2026.

George Clooney is once again a little irritated with Quentin Tarantino. The Jay Kelly star has joined the chorus of actors standing in solidarity with Paul Dano, Matthew Lillard, and Owen Wilson after the Pulp Fiction director said the three of them were among the “weakest” actors working. Clooney doesn't think Tarantino's comments were appropriate; in fact, he thinks they're cruel.  

“By the way, Paul Dano and Owen Wilson and Matthew Lillard, I would be honored to work with those actors. Honored,” Clooney said at AARP's Movies for Grownups Awards on January 10, according to Variety. He was accepting an award for Jay Kelly, which he says was “made by people who love actors — that's an important part. People I've known most of my life… actually, most of them are actors. I have a great affinity [for them], and I don't enjoy watching people be cruel.” Clooney continued, “We are living in a time of cruelty. We don't need to be adding to it.”

Tarantino's comments came during his appearance on the Bret Easton Ellis podcast last month. The director shared his favorite films of the 21st century so far, and included both There Will Be Blood and Midnight In Paris on the list, despite disliking two of the major players in those films. “The flaw is Paul Dano,” he said of There Will Be Blood. “Obviously, it's supposed to be a two-hander, but it's also drastically obvious that it's not a two-hander. [Dano] is weak sauce, man. He is the weak sister… The weakest fucking actor in SAG.” He also listed Wilson as an actor that he “really can't stand.”

“Dancing With the Stars” fans are buzzing after Witney Carson and Robert Irwin reunited in the most fitting location possible, the Australia Zoo. The former dance partners and winners of the Mirrorball Trophy for season 34 shared a glimpse of their reunion on social media, instantly sparking excitement among fans and drawing comments.

Witney Carson has made her way to Australia with her husband, Carson McAllister, and their adorable kids, Kevin and Jet.

In the video shared on Robert's Instagram page, the video is set to “Back in Black” by AC/DC. It first shows Witney and her family, all dressed in safari gear at the zoo.

Witney puts on some sunglasses as they walk towards the camera, looking like a cool family. Then the camera pans over to the bushes, and who pops out? None other than Robert himself!

He joins the family while they walk, slapping hands with both Witney and Carson.

Robert then pumps his arms in the air as they continue to walk off, and the video comes to an end.

Witney previously shared that she and her family would be heading to Australia, warning Robert Irwin to watch out. That means fans have been anticipating this reunion, so now they are ecstatic that it has finally taken place, and they have quickly jumped in the comments.

One fan wrote, “The kids totally understood the assignment,” and another fan added, “Hope those kids know how legendary this is,” and a third person added, “Uncle Robert got two nephews now😍❤️.”

The love continued, with this user writing, “The reunion that the whole world didn't know it needed, and we're here for it! The best dance partnership ever! ❤️🇨🇦”

Another fan added, “The real prize was the friendship you guys gained from dancing together!!❤️”

As we stated above, “DWTS” fans have been waiting for this reunion and they weren't disappointed. This fan wrote, “What we've been waiting for! 🙌❤️🔥👏,” while another added, “It's safe to say, we ALL love this REUNION!!!!! 🙌🙌🙌🙌🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️”

We are sure the fun is just getting started, as one user wrote, “Yay!!! Can't wait to see all the adventures!!”

We have to agree with this one, as I am sure the family is going to have a lot of adventures at the zoo and in Australia. We look forward to seeing more videos soon!

	2026 is the year of BTS. The supergroup will mark its live return with an extensive tour launching this April and running through March 2027, with additional dates to be announced. The trek arrives in support of their upcoming musical return, scheduled to arrive on March 20 as part of their comeback following an extended hiatus.


	The BTS world tour will kick off in Goyang, South Korea, on April 9. The band will spend multiple nights in each city on the trek, which includes stops in Tokyo, Mexico City, Las Vegas, Busan, London, Paris, Chicago, Toronto, East Rutherford, Buenos Aires, Sydney, Bangkok, Hong Kong, and Manila. Specific venues for each city have not been announced, though the routing suggests the band will be booking stadiums.


	ARMY Membership holders will have access to tickets beginning Jan. 22 and 23 local time. A general sale will follow on Jan. 24 across all regions. 


	BTS have been in the studio working on new music since July, promising an album that will “reflect each member's thoughts and ideas.” At the beginning of the year, RM shared, “We've waited more earnestly than anyone else,” with Jimin adding, “The year we've been waiting for has finally arrived.” V teased, “In 2026, we'll make even more good memories, so look forward to it!”

	











	Fans have been anticipating the album and accompanying live show since last year. “We're approaching the album with the same mindset we had when we first started,” BTS shared in July. “We're also planning a world tour alongside the new album. We'll be visiting fans all around the world, so we hope you're as excited as we are.”

	











	The members of BTS had a chance to sharpen their skills even during their time away from the group. Outside of completing their mandatory military service requirements, V, Suga, Jin, Jungkook, RM, Jimin, and J-Hope also pursued solo endeavors as musicians. Suga, Jin, and J-Hope also headlined respective solo tours. “I sought advice from him on the overall structure of the tour,” J-Hope told Rolling Stone last year about discussing solo touring with Suga. “As for the performances, we each bring a unique set of strengths to the stage, so I focused on shaping the production to reflect what I wanted to explore in various ways.” Now, they're bringing their lessons back to the band.

	In the aftermath of U.S. forces capturing Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, President Donald Trump has moved on to pressuring Cuba to cut a deal with the U.S., reiterating his desire to take over Greenland, urging Mexico's president to accept U.S. intervention, and threatening military actions in Colombia and Iran. Last week also saw the tragic death of Renee Nicole Good at the hands of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross. The Trump administration responded to the killing by smearing Good as a “domestic terrorist.”


	When speaking from behind The Daily Show desk on Monday, Jon Stewart acutely commented on the president and his administration's escalating threats of force both domestically and internationally: “What the fuck is happening? What the fuck is happening in this country? From Minnesota, to Venezuela, to Iran, to Greenland, Cuba, Mexico, Colombia.”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Comparing the mounting chaos to an amusement ride, the host observed, “We are on the Donald Trump Gravitron.” He continued, “We don't know what up or down is. We just know it feels like we're all gonna vomit. Each moment brings another event with cataclysmic implications and consequences, and the guy at the center of it, the instigator, the catalyst of all this chaos and confusion, he's just out there TGIF-ing it.”

	











	Stewart also compared footage of Trump insisting that the rioters who participated in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol (the president pardoned 1,500 of them last year) were “peaceful people” exuding “passion” and “love” to Trump and his administration calling Good, a 37-year-old Minneapolis mother who was fatally shot in the head by ICE, “highly disrespectful” and a “deranged lunatic.”

	











	“We are in a confusing dark place,” Stewart said. “This is where, quite frankly, rule of law and institutions are kind of an important framework. But now that those are gone, what's our North Star?” The host answered the question by rolling video of Trump saying that his “own morality” was the only thing checking his authority.

	For those worrying if Trump is “feeling the burden of this moment,” Stewart assured earlier in the segment that he is not. The comedian cut to a clip of oil executives gathered at the White House to talk about expanding drilling in Venezuela when suddenty Trump interrupts the meeting to wander off and look out a window.


	“Look at fucking Rubio and Vance,” joked Stewart. “Look at the faces on Heckle and Jeckle over here. Looking and smiling like, ‘Oh, Pawpaw! He is so cute! You should see him when the ice cream truck goes by!'”

A small town in California was hit by earthquakes once every 22 years for over a century, setting the stage for a major seismic experiment in the 1980s and 90s. But the quake ended up being 11 years late. In this excerpt from ""When Worlds Quake,"" geophysicist Hrvoje Tkalčić looks at why predicting earthquakes is so difficult.

Predicting earthquakes before they happen is currently impossible, but scientists are edging closer and closer with new and innovative ways to monitor movements in Earth's crust. In this excerpt from ""When Worlds Quake: The Quest to Understand the Interior of Earth and Beyond"" (Princeton University Press, 2026), author Hrvoje Tkalčić, the head of geophysics at the Australian National University, delves into the reasons why earthquake prediction is so tricky, looking at the ""Parkfield Experiment,"" where scientists waited nearly 20 years for an earthquake on the San Andreas Fault to strike.

You can often read rude and even vulgar comments under online newspaper articles about the purpose of the seismological profession when people in their post-earthquake trauma realize that seismologists don't forecast like meteorologists do, such as forecast hail or tornadoes with high accuracy.

An approximate answer to these comments could be given with the following targeted question: ""We still can't beat malignant diseases, but should we stop researching because of that?""

We are used to discussions about earthquake causes after every event, particularly in the places where the world's earthquakes occur. There are discussions about their frequency, and quite often, there are those who claim they could recognize the coming earthquake in something else. Whether it's a full moon, a planetary conjunction, too much rainfall, bone pain, overexploitation of the planet's resources or greed, people tend to believe that earthquakes have simpler explanations than physical forces in the interior of the Earth and, of course, that they can be predicted.

Let's travel to California in the 1970s and 80s, to a small, picturesque town of only 18 inhabitants — Parkfield — located between San Francisco and Los Angeles, near the central part of the San Andreas Fault. You're probably wondering why. Well, this small town is known to the seismological world for its turbulent geological history. Namely, on average, significant earthquakes have occurred in Parkfield every 22 years since the middle of the 18th century.

But it was fascinating that the recorded seismograms for the earthquakes of 1922, 1934 and 1966 were almost identical, one wiggly seismogram line to the other. In addition, the 1934 and 1966 earthquakes had foreshocks — about 17 minutes before the main shock — whose seismograms also looked very similar.

You wonder how such a thing is even possible. Such similarity of seismograms is possible only if the same fault surface is always activated and recorded with the same instrument at sufficiently long waves. Of course, the shorter the waves, the greater the differences. In other words, you have a source — an earthquake and a receiver — a seismometer at fixed locations, and waves propagating between them through the same material. So, you have a perfect natural laboratory and an experiment set up in it. You just have to wait long enough.

Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

Scientists, therefore, had good maps in hand to investigate the mechanisms of earthquakes that recur from time to time on an active, well-monitored fault. Since the mid-1980s, they have installed a whole arsenal of instruments near Parkfield and along the fault: powerful seismographs, then strainmeters, which measure rock deformation at a depth of 650 feet (~200 meters) along the fault, magnetometers for measuring the intensity of the magnetic field, creepmeters, which measure displacements on the surface along the fault, and other scientific ""weaponry."" They forecasted with 90 to 95% confidence that the next earthquake there would occur between 1985 and 1993. Some of the key questions were:

1. How is stress distributed in space and time on the fault due to the action of tectonic forces before and after the earthquake?

2. Do earthquakes repeat at an average time interval, or is each earthquake unique, a story in itself?

3. How do the structure of faults and surrounding rocks affect the nucleation of smaller earthquakes and the possibility of larger ones and their distribution in time and space?

 




They wondered what the deformation we measure on the surface could tell us about the stress distribution on the fault, and they hoped for a positive result — confirmation of the predictions for earthquake occurrences between 1985 and 1993. They waited and waited. In those years, I worked once a week with colleagues at the U.S. Geological Survey California office in Menlo Park, in the northwestern part of Silicon Valley, where I was able to observe some scientists involved in the experiment.

Eventually, a magnitude 6.0 earthquake did happen in Parkfield, but not until 2004. We greeted the most watched and studied earthquake in human history with a huge question mark above our heads; it occurred 11 years after its forecasted time. Devastating. That's why the ""Parkfield Experiment"" left a bitter taste of disappointment in the mouth. But, as they say, only those who dare to fail eventually succeed. Research continued.

Why is earthquake prediction so tricky? Each fault is different — some of them we know about, but many we don't — earthquake catalogs don't go back far enough, and, after all, underground architecture is entirely invisible to us.

We do not know how deep the fault reaches, whether it is a flat or curved surface, whether its surface is smooth or rough, whether and where it touches other faults, the chemical composition of the rocks on one and the other side of the fault, or their physical properties, for example, strength and porosity. We do not know precisely how the deformation we observe on the surface of the Earth can be related to the deformation and stress in the depth of the fault. We also do not know many other factors. A forecast can be made, but by its very nature, it must be probabilistic and taken with a grain of salt. So, how do we proceed?

 




Not everything is so negative. The first good news is that seismic hazard maps exist in most countries. They are well made, but of course, they must be constantly updated. The other good news is that, based on fundamental knowledge of physics and the propagation of seismic waves through the interior and across the surface of the Earth, we can predict how the ground and some buildings will behave during an earthquake, and that is already a major benefit.

This is possible because of basic science and seismological research on the nature of the subsurface, in a similar way that radiologists can illuminate the inside of the human body. Ironically, earthquakes help us because they serve as a source of waves illuminating the Earth's interior. It is possible to predict infrastructure behavior during earthquakes due to the development of engineering, construction, computer science and numerical methods. Either way, those hazard maps serve as input for engineers, builders and insurance companies.

In the end, the most positive thing is that modern studies involving laboratory models and artificial intelligence are being carried out across the world, aimed in the direction that one day we will be able to predict earthquakes. Certainly not without major investment in science and technology, which will need to continue to develop. This might even take us to the point where we will have to place thousands or millions of microsensors on every fault in the Earth's interior and then monitor the strain in real time.

In a way, we will have a ""crystal ball"" — an insight into the dynamics and future behavior of faults. In fact, we are already doing it today, but we have only scratched the surface of the Earth with the help of satellites. InSAR, LIDAR and GPS are just some of the networks and methods that give us an insight into where the Earth's crust is most stressed from surface deformations.

The stress or tension build-up mechanism on a fault is still under investigation. It is most likely that the hot rocks of the Earth's continental crust beneath approximately 9.3 miles (15 kilometers) of depth are ductile, and this rock mass ""flows"" at a higher speed than on the surface, but without earthquakes, and the upper part of the crust therefore bends and the stress along the fault surface increases. However, how this stress is distributed in space is not yet known.

Furthermore, laboratory experiments at high pressures and temperatures give us insight into how hard rocks are and how strain and stress are related. The chemical and physical structure of the soil is examined by drilling around the fault. Old tree trunks are explored, and excavations are made to detect historical earthquakes on rock samples.

—Predicting earthquakes is currently impossible. GPS data could help change that

—What are the signs that nature is telling us?' Scientists are triggering earthquakes in the Alps to find out what happens before one hits

—Link between Cascadia and San Andreas Fault earthquakes discovered 30 years after lost vessel stumbled across key data

Investments are made in studying the deeper interior of the Earth and the mechanism of earthquakes using seismic waves and tomography methods. Investments are also made in mathematical geophysics, as well as in machine learning and improved techniques for processing enormous amounts of digital data. Investments are also made in alarm systems based on the detection of P waves. Even a few seconds of warning before the arrival of S waves can be crucial to saving people and infrastructure. Likewise, investments are being made in modern construction resistant to earthquakes.

But the conclusion is that, unless you want to move to stable parts of the continents, somewhere in Siberia, to the northernmost, permanently frozen parts of Canada, or the remote regions of the Australian Outback seldom struck by earthquakes, we need to learn to live with earthquakes.

      Here's a thought experiment that's been growing on me, and I'm curious how this community sees it.
    


      Modern physics admits two enormous gaps:
    


      • We don't know what consciousness fundamentally is. • We don't know what dark matter is.
    


      What if those two mysteries aren't separate?
    


      A few physicists and philosophers have proposed that consciousness might be a fundamental field woven into spacetime — something brains interface with rather than generate. In that view, consciousness isn't produced by neurons; neurons are just the biological hardware that tune into a deeper substrate.
    


      Now here's the twist:
    


      What if dark matter is the physical footprint of that consciousness field?
    


      Dark matter:
    


      • permeates the universe • interacts gravitationally • doesn't interact with light • forms large‑scale structures • is completely invisible
    


      A consciousness field would behave the same way: non‑electromagnetic, pervasive, and detectable only through its influence on spacetime.
    


      If that's true, then a sufficiently advanced civilization might not use propulsion at all. They might interface with the consciousness field directly, the same way we interface with electromagnetism.
    


      That could explain UAP behavior without breaking physics:
    


      • inertia‑free acceleration • instantaneous direction changes • silent movement • non‑ballistic trajectories • apparent “awareness” of observers
    


      Not magic. Not anti‑gravity. Just a deeper layer of physics we haven't mapped yet.
    


      In this model, consciousness isn't a byproduct of biology — it's a medium of nature. Brains are temporary hosts. When we die, the structured pattern dissolves, but the field remains. Consciousness continues to another vessel.
    


      And a civilization that learned to manipulate that field would look like it was bending reality.
    


      Maybe that's exactly what we're seeing.
    


      When it comes to the most convincing UFO sightings ever reported, opinions on Reddit are varied and passionate. Here are some of the most frequently mentioned and compelling cases:
    


Description: Over 60 children in Ruwa, Zimbabwe, witnessed a craft landing in their schoolyard and a few beings emerging. The incident was investigated by a well-known psychologist, and a documentary is available on YouTube.
    


Quote: ""The Ariel school incident in Africa is my favourite. Surprised it hasn't been mentioned. 60 plus children apparently witnessed a craft landing in the schoolyard and a few beings came out.""



Description: Military personnel at RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge in Suffolk, England, reported seeing unusual lights and a metallic object in Rendlesham Forest. The incident included audio recordings of military pursuit.
    


Quote: ""Imo, the most convincing UFO event was the Rendlesham Forest incident. Given we have not only testimony of the military base commander, but the audio tapes of the military pursuit of the UFO at the time it occurred.""



Description: U.S. Navy pilots, including David Fravor, encountered a ""tic tac"" shaped object that displayed incredible speed and maneuverability off the coast of California. The incident was captured on FLIR footage and corroborated by multiple witnesses.
    


Quote: ""For me, it's the eyewitness testimony of David Fraver, the fighter pilot who described his interactions with the 'tic tac' ufo off the coast of California during his training runs.""



Description: Thousands of people across Arizona, including the governor, witnessed a series of lights in a V-formation moving silently across the night sky.
    


Quote: ""Phoenix lights...""



Description: Iranian military pilots had a multi-hour encounter with a UFO that was tracked on radar and caused instrumentation and communications failures on their F-4 jets.
    


Quote: ""1976 Tehran UFO incident: Nothing beats this one. Military personals, radars and civilian plane encountered the UFO.""



Description: A JAL cargo pilot and his crew witnessed a massive UFO and two smaller objects over Alaska, which were also tracked by ground radar.
    


Quote: ""Japan Air Lines flight 1628 incident & Belgian UFO wave""



Description: A woman and her son photographed a disc-shaped craft with a triangular pattern of lights. The photos were analyzed and found to be consistent with early 2000s digital camera artifacts.
    


Quote: ""# Weyauwega, Wisconsin UFO (February 1, 2003)""
    


Description: A witness observed a black matte teardrop-shaped object that descended rapidly, hovered, and then dissipated into smoke. The object emitted a low hum and rumbling noises.
    


Quote: ""# Albuquerque, New Mexico UFO (July 4, 2019)""
    


Description: Multiple videos from different angles showed a pyramid-shaped object floating over the Pentagon. The footage was featured on television shows but did not receive widespread attention.
    


Quote: ""Definitely the weird pyramid thing that was floating over the Pentagon in the United States.""



Description: Several witnesses in Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia, saw a large object crash into the water, leaving a yellowish foam. The Canadian military investigated but found no explanation.
    


Quote: ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shag_Harbour_UFO_incident""



      These sightings are among the most credible and well-documented UFO incidents, supported by multiple witnesses, radar data, and even military testimony. While they remain unexplained, they provide compelling evidence that there may be more to the UFO phenomenon than meets the eye.

Over 50 global intellectuals signed a declaration supporting the Palestine Action hunger strikers and opposing genocide.

More than 50 international authors and academics signed a declaration published Monday in support of hunger-striking activists allegedly linked to the banned Palestine Action movement, who are at imminent risk of death after refusing to eat for more than two months.

The brief statement — “We oppose genocide, we support the Palestine Action prisoners” — was signed by prominent figures including historian Tariq Ali; novelist Sally Rooney; former Guantánamo Bay prisoner Moazzam Begg; journalists Owen Jones and George Monbiot; and professors Angela Davis, Judith Butler, Naomi Klein, and Ilan Pappé.

The declaration echoes the message on a placard held by Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg when she was arrested last month in London protesting the imprisonment of people accused of being part of Palestine Action after the nonviolent direct action group was officially declared a terrorist organization in July by the UK government.

Since then, more than 2,000 people have been arrested for supporting Palestine Action, often while simply holding signs. Eight accused Palestine Action activists are awaiting trial for allegedly breaking into and damaging a British military base and a facility run by Israeli arms maker Elbit Systems. The defendants are facing at least 18 months behind bars before trial.

On November 2, a small group of imprisoned activists launched a hunger strike. Three people — Heba Muraisi, Kamran Ahmed, and Lewie Chiaramello — are still striking, despite imminent danger of death.

“She's dying. She said it: ‘I'm dying,'” Francesca Nadin said of her friend Muraisi — who is on the 71st day of her strike — during a Monday interview with the Guardian.

Nadin said that the 31-year-old's body is “shutting down.”

“I know mentally she'll remain strong right to the last moment but she is dying,” she added. “The government, by putting her in prison and denying her all her rights, they're not just letting her die, they're actively killing her.”

Ahmed, 28, has been refusing food for 64 days. Doctors have informed him that his heart muscles are shrinking and he is at risk of sudden cardiac arrest.

“He's skinny. I describe him a bit like a piece of paper,” Shahmina Alam, Ahmed's sister, told Al Jazeera last week. “It feels like now every time you see him, it could be the last.”

Chiaramello, 22, has Type 1 diabetes and has been fasting every other day for 44 days.

A fourth person, Umar Khalid, has reportedly resumed his strike following a 13-day pause.

Despite her dire condition, Muraisi is “intent on carrying on until the demands are met,” according to friend Amareen Afzal.

The strikers are demanding immediate bail, an end to censorship of their communications, a fair trial, lifting of the ban on Palestine Action, and closure of Elbit Systems' UK facilities.

“The hunger strikers' demands seem reasonable to me,” Monbiot wrote last week. “All these things, I believe, should be happening anyway. And they are of course negotiating positions. Whether all would need to be met for the strike to end cannot be known until the government engages. Its refusal to talk could condemn the strikers to death.”

Standing in stark contrast with the US military's torturous force-feeding of hunger striking Guantánamo Bay prisoners during the Obama administration, the UK follows recommendations in the World Medical Association's Declaration of Malta, which advises doctors not to force-feed prisoners who choose to hunger strike and understand the consequences of their actions.

“Forcible feeding is never ethically acceptable,” the declaration states.

In 1981, UK authorities allowed 10 imprisoned Irish Republican Army members, including former Member of Parliament Bobby Sands, to starve themselves to death in Northern Ireland. Their deaths occurred after between 46 and 73 days of refusing food.

A group of former hunger strikers from Palestine, Ireland, and Guantánamo on Sunday issued an urgent appeal to the UK government to save the Palestine Action strikers' lives, and condemning the terrorist designation.

Critics said that the government would be to blame should any of the hunger strikers die.

“The UK is now perilously close to full descent into authoritarian rule,” said professor Peter Hallward, who signed the intellectuals' declaration. “Ministers won't even meet with hunger strikers, who are now at death's door.”

Hallward added that British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy, Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper, and Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood “seem perfectly ready to let this country's most committed and courageous opponents of an ongoing genocide waste away and die.”

Israel's US-backed war and siege on Gaza following the Hamas-led attack of October 7, 2023 has left more than 250,000 Palestinians dead, wounded, or missing in Gaza and most of the coastal strip in ruins. Around 2 million Gazans have been forcibly displaced, starved, or sickened.

Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces since the current cease-fire took effect three months ago. Israeli authorities are still blocking or strictly limiting the entry of critical supplies into Gaza, where 2-month-old infant Mohammed Abu Harbid over the weekend became at least the fourth Palestinian baby to freeze to death since November.

More than a dozen Palestinians — including at least five children — have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza in recent days.

Israel is facing a genocide case filed by South Africa at the International Court of Justice, the principal judicial body of the United Nations, where a panel of experts found last year that Israel was committing genocide. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant are also wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.

On Monday, a court in Edinburgh held a hearing on a petition filed by human rights campaigner and former diplomat Craig Murray seeking to lift the ban on Palestine Action in Scotland, whose judiciary is independent from the rest of the UK.

“The impact of proscription of Palestine Action has been appalling,” attorney Joanna Cherry told the court. “Scores of peaceful people of entirely good character have been arrested under the absurd pretence of terrorism.”

“We are dealing with human rights and liberties — some of the most fundamental in our society,” Cherry added. “If people don't have the right to express their views and assemble to express their views, they can't really take part in civil society properly and adequately. It's hard to imagine a more urgent situation.”

…We ask that you take just a second to read this message.

We are up against a far-reaching, wide-scale attack on press freedom coming from the Trump administration. Since his inauguration last year, we've seen frightening censorship, a right-wing takeover of the news industry, and worsening financial conditions for progressive nonprofits across the board.

We can only resist Trump's agenda by cultivating a strong base of support. The right-wing mediasphere is funded comfortably by billionaire owners and venture capitalist philanthropists. At Truthout, we have you.

            Microsoft says it will ask to pay higher electricity bills in areas where it's building data centers, in an effort to prevent electricity prices for local residents from rising in those areas. The move is part of a broader plan to address rising prices and other concerns sparked by the tech industry's massive buildout of artificial intelligence infrastructure across the United States.
    


            Big Tech is spending hundreds of billions of dollars to build the data centers that power AI systems. They hoover up vast amounts of electricity, but it's a project that leaders in Silicon Valley and on Capitol Hill have framed as essential for the economy and national security.
    


            But the rising costs from that electricity demand has prompted backlash from local communities worried about the impact on their energy bills and the environment. Areas near data centers saw an increase in electricity costs of as much as 267% compared to five years ago, a Bloomberg News analysis from last year found.
    


            What's more, many Americans have argued that they did not ask for the AI buildout and worry they won't benefit from it, given warnings from tech leaders that AI could eliminate jobs. 



            Microsoft, accordingly, is now saying it will seek to pay not just for the energy its data centers use, but also to cover the costs of updating and adding necessary electricity to the grid, so those costs aren't passed on to other local utility customers.
    


Is AI really making electricity bills higher? Here's what the experts say



            “I think the bare minimum, as we look to the future, is to give these communities around the country the confidence that when a data center comes, its presence will not raise their electricity prices,” Microsoft President Brad Smith said at an event in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday announcing the plan.
    


            Microsoft's efforts to be a good neighbor in the areas where it builds data centers also include plans to invest in local water systems, libraries and schools, as well as job and AI skills training.
    


            The company's Tuesday announcement comes a day after President Donald Trump teased plans he said his administration developed with Big Tech to address Americans' rising electricity bills.
    


            “Therefore, my Administration is working with major American Technology Companies to secure their commitment to the American people, and we will have much to announce in the coming weeks to ensure that Americans don't ‘pick up the tab' for their POWER consumption, in terms of higher Utility bills,” Trump said in a Truth Social post on Monday, adding that the first announcement would come from Microsoft. The move comes as Trump has been taking steps to address Americans' affordability concerns.
    


            Despite the protests against AI data centers, Smith said, “we fundamentally believe that data centers can fuel economic prosperity, not for the few, but for everybody in a community that depends on these schools, and these hospitals, and all of these other public services and jobs.”
    


            Smith added that the company will pay for water “replenishment” when its data centers must draw on local water supplies. In Arizona, for example, Microsoft has worked with the municipality to find and fix leaks in their pipes that could be causing the community to lose fresh water. He also said Microsoft will not ask for property tax reductions or abatements in the areas where it plans to build.
    


            The company plans to provide job training for construction workers to build data centers and long-term data center operators, although data centers require fewer workers to run once they're fully built. Microsoft also says it will partner with local schools, libraries, non-profits and businesses to offer AI skills training.
    


            Smith framed the AI data center buildout in grand terms, as the next phase in America's infrastructure history.
    


            “Decade after decade, century after century, infrastructure has always raised new questions, new concerns, new controversies, and yet throughout it all, it has been vital to the growth and prosperity of our nation,” he said.

President Donald Trump is in Michigan to promote his efforts to boost U.S. manufacturing, as he tries to counter fears about a weakening job market and worries that still-rising prices are taking a toll on Americans' pocketbooks. The day trip includes a tour of a Ford factory in Dearborn that makes best-selling F-150 pickups, and an address to the Detroit Economic Club.

It comes as the Trump administration's criminal investigation of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has sparked an outcry, with defenders of the U.S. central bank pushing back against Trump's efforts to exert more control over it. Federal data from December released before the president left Washington showed Inflation declined a bit last month as prices for gas and used cars fell — a sign that cost pressures are slowly easing.

In their wake of off-year election losses for the GOP, the White House said Trump would put a greater emphasis on talking directly to the public about his economic policies after doing relatively few events around the country earlier in his term.

Other news we're following:








The president essentially accused the Fed of stealing his joy by not being bullish about lowering interest rates.

“If you announce great numbers, they raise interest rates,” Trump said in the speech. “When the market goes up, they should lower rates.”

Trump has disagreed sharply with the interest rate strategy of the independent Fed, chaired by Jerome Powell, and has pressed for lower rates, faster. He maintains that a rising stock market should cause the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rates in order to further boost economic growth.

But the Fed has the legal responsibility of keeping prices stable and maximizing employment. Slashing rates as Trump has suggested could push more money into the U.S. economy and worsen inflation.

The president opened with introductions and a few jokes, then immediately shifted to talking about his elections and voter ID laws, instead of the economy.

He then resumed recognizing some of the more notable people in the audience in Detroit.

The president stopped to speak to reporters while touring the auto factory and was indifferent to the idea of renegotiating the United States-Mexico-Canada trade pact, or USMCA, which is up for review this year.

“I think they want it,” he said of the other nations. “I don't really care.”

Trump said the U.S. doesn't need cars made in Canada or Mexico, but he wants to see them made in the U.S.

Beijing on Tuesday criticized President Donald Trump's plan to impose an additional 25% tariff on Iran's trading partners, which includes China, Iran's largest trading partner.

“Tariff wars have no winners,” said Mao Ning, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry. “China will firmly protect its legitimate and lawful rights and interests.”

It's not immediately clear if the tariff on Chinese goods will go up, because the two governments have agreed to a yearlong truce in their trade war following a summit between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in October in South Korea.

On Tuesday, the Chinese commerce ministry extended anti-dumping tariffs on U.S. solar polysilicon imports. The rates are 53.3% to 57%.

U.S. Health Secretary has added two more members to his controversial vaccine advisory panel.

Dr. Kimberly Biss and Dr. Adam Urato on Tuesday were named to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. The committee recommends how vaccines should be used.

Kennedy — a leading antivaccine activist before becoming the nation's top health official — last year fired all 17 of the panel's previous members, replacing them now with 13 that includes several anti-vaccine voices.

Biss, based in Florida, has urged pregnant women not to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Urato, based in Massachusetts, has warned about medications taken during pregnancy — particularly antidepressants.

The Clintons, in a letter released on social media, are slamming a subpoena for their testimony as “legally invalid” even as Republican lawmakers prepared contempt of Congress proceedings against them.

The Clintons wrote that the chair of the House Oversight Committee, Republican Rep. James Comer, is on the cusp of a process “literally designed to result in our imprisonment” and vowed to “forcefully defend” ourselves.

After Bill Clinton failed to show up for scheduled deposition Tuesday morning, Comer says he will being contempt of Congress proceedings next week. That would start a complicated and politically messy process that Congress has rarely reached for and could result in prosecution from the Justice Department.

The change means EPA rules for fine particulate matter and ozone will focus only on the cost to industry. 

It's part of a broader realignment under Trump toward a business-friendly approach that has included the rollback of multiple policies meant to safeguard human health and the environment and slow climate change.

The agency said in a statement that it “absolutely remains committed to our core mission of protecting human health and the environment” but “will not be monetizing the impacts at this time.”

Environmental and public health advocates called the action a dangerous abdication of one of EPA's core missions, to protect public health. They said the change could lead to more asthma attacks, heart disease and premature deaths.

Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican who has been outspoken against the Trump administration's overseas military pursuits, said an attack on Iran would likely harm U.S. interests and could backfire.

“I hope they are able to rise up in sufficient force to actually topple the regime,” he said about the Iranian people protesting.

“But once we start dropping bombs on their government, I mean, it can create the opposite of the intended effect, because when people — no matter who they are, whether they're pro or against the regime — tend to be unhappy when foreign bombs are dropping on them.”

A senior Greenland government official said Tuesday it's “unfathomable” that the United States is discussing taking over a NATO ally and urged the Trump administration to listen to voices from the Arctic island nation.

Naaja Nathanielsen, Greenland's minister for business and mineral resources, said people in Greenland are “very, very worried” about the U.S. rhetoric.

She spoke a day before a key meeting in Washington between foreign ministers of the semi-autonomous Danish territory and Denmark and top U.S. officials, at a time of increased tensions between the allies over the administration's desire for control of Greenland.

“People are not sleeping, children are afraid, and it just fills everything these days. And we can't really understand it,” Nathanielsen said at a meeting with lawmakers in Britain's Parliament.

The president sidestepped a reporter's question Tuesday about whether the Justice Department's investigation into Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell will undermine confidence in the U.S. central bank. 

Trump instead took the opportunity to criticize Powell, briefly referencing the Federal Reserve buildings' renovation costs before leaving for Detroit.

“He's billions of dollars overbudget, so he either is incompetent or he's crooked,” Trump said. “I don't know what he is. But certainly he doesn't do a very good job.”

Trump has blamed Powell for not cutting interest rates to his liking, even though a committee votes on rate decisions. Powell has said the investigation is pretext for undermining the central bank's ability to maintain steady economic growth with low inflation and unemployment by independently setting the nation's interest rates.

Days of demonstrations against immigration agents left Minnesota tense on Tuesday, a day after federal authorities used tear gas to break up crowds of whistle-blowing activists and state and local leaders sued to fight the enforcement surge that led to the fatal shooting of a Minneapolis woman.

Confrontations between federal agents and protesters stretched across multiple cities. Agents fired tear gas in Minneapolis as a crowd gathered around immigration officers questioning a man, while to the northwest in St. Cloud hundreds of people protested outside a strip of Somali-run businesses after ICE officers arrived. Later Monday night, protesters and officers squared off outside the federal building used as a base for the Twin Cities crackdown.

The president's tour of a factory in Dearborn that makes F-150 pickups and his speech to the Detroit Economic Club at the MotorCity Casino come as his administration aims a criminal investigation at Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that has raised widespread concerns over the destabilizing effects of exerting more control over the U.S. central bank.

Trump got some good news as he left Washington: Federal data from December showed inflation declined a bit last month as prices for gas and used cars fell — a sign that cost pressures are slowly easing. Consumer prices rose 0.3% in December from the prior month, the Labor Department said, the same as in November.

“We have very low inflation,” Trump told reporters on the White House lawn, “and growth is going up. We have tremendous growth numbers.” 

Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton say they will refuse to comply with a congressional subpoena for them to testify in an investigation into Jeffrey Epstein.

The Clintons are slamming a Republican-controlled committee's attempts as “legally invalid” as GOP lawmakers prepare contempt of Congress proceedings against them. In a letter released on social media Tuesday, the Clinton's tell the chair of the House Oversight Committee, Republican Rep. James Comer, he's on the cusp of a process “literally designed to result in our imprisonment.”

Comer says he'll begin contempt of Congress proceedings next week. It potentially starts a complicated and politically messy process that Congress has rarely reached for.

NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte refused to be drawn into a dispute between the United States and Denmark over Greenland, insisting that it's not his role.

“I never, ever comment when there are discussions within the alliance,” Rutte said at the European Parliament in Brussels. “My role has to be to make sure we solve issues.”

He said the 32-nation military organization must focus on providing security in the Arctic region, which includes Greenland. “When it comes to the protection of the High North, that is my role.”

Pressed about Trump's designs on Greenland and warnings against any U.S. action from Denmark, Rutte said: “I can never comment on that. That's impossible in public.”

The White House said Tuesday that the Smithsonian must turn over documentation on its current and planned exhibits as part of a review the White House ordered last year, or face potential funding cuts. 

The letter to Lonnie G. Bunch III, the Secretary of the Smithsonian, said the documents fulfill Trump's order in March to remove “improper ideology” from the museums' exhibits. 

Trump's order, entitled: “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” led to a review ordered last August of eight museums. The letter said it had received a submission in September but nothing since. “We wish to be assured that none of the leadership of the Smithsonian museums is confused about the fact that the United States has been among the greatest forces for good in the history of the world,” said the letter.

“Temporary means temporary,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement to The Associated Press.

DHS told Fox News separately that Somalis with Temporary Protected Status must leave the U.S. by March 17, when existing protections expire.

The TPS move comes amid Trump's immigration crackdown in Minneapolis, where many Somalis have U.S. citizenship. Trump has targeted Somali immigrants with racist rhetoric and accused them of defrauding federal programs. 

A congressional report last year estimated the Somali TPS population at 705 people. Noem insisted that circumstances in Somalia “have improved to the point that it no longer meets the law's requirement for Temporary Protected Status.”

Located in the horn of Africa, Somalia is one of the world's poorest nations and has for decades been beset by chronic strife and insecurity exacerbated by multiple natural disasters, including severe droughts. 

A bill introduced by Sen. Ed Markey and Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts would allow people to sue federal law enforcement officers for civil rights violations and remove their qualified immunity protections in such cases.

“When masked ICE agents are allowed to kill and harm people with impunity, we have crossed a dangerous threshold in our nation,” Markey said in a statement.

The bill “sends a powerful message to everyone in America — citizen or not — that when ICE agents break the law, they should and will be held accountable” Pressley said.

The bill stands little chance of passage in the GOP-controlled Congress.

Qualified immunity protects government agents from lawsuits unless they violate “clearly established” constitutional or statutory protections. Debates over the scope of the legal doctrine have held up bipartisan negotiations over policing reforms.

The Democratic National Committee will spend millions of dollars to cement control of voter registration efforts that have traditionally been entrusted to nonprofit advocacy groups and individual political campaigns. Party leaders hope the shift will increase their chances this year and cement successes for many elections to come.

The initiative being announced on Tuesday in Arizona and Nevada could become the DNC's largest-ever push to sign up new voters. The focus is on young people, voters of color and people without college educations — demographics that drifted away from Democrats in the last presidential race, which returned Trump to the White House.

“It's a crisis. And for our party to actually win elections, we have to actually create more Democrats,” DNC Chair Ken Martin said in an interview with The Associated Press. Party leaders want a more explicitly partisan approach like the one used by Republicans, who have relied less on outside groups to register and mobilize their voter base.

The U.S. president has repeatedly threatened Tehran with military action if his administration found the Islamic Republic was using deadly force against antigovernment protesters. Trump on Sunday told reporters he believed Iran is “starting to cross” that line and has left him and his national security team weighing “very strong options” even as he said the Iranians had made outreach efforts to the U.S.

But on Monday, the president's team offered guarded hope that diplomatic solution could be found.

“What you're hearing publicly from the Iranian regime is quite different from the messages the administration is receiving privately, and I think the president has an interest in exploring those messages,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Monday. “However, with that said, the president has shown he's unafraid to use military options if and when he deems necessary, and nobody knows that better than Iran.”

The U.S. president has repeatedly threatened Tehran with military action if his administration found the Islamic Republic was using deadly force against anti-government protesters, but has not said whether he has made a decision on a response.

On Monday, Trump said he would slap 25% tariffs on countries doing business with Tehran “effective immediately” but the White House has not provided details on that move. China, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Brazil and Russia are among economies that do business with Tehran.

Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and key White House National Security Council officials began meeting Friday to develop a “suite of options” for Trump ranging from a diplomatic approach to military strikes.

Trump said Tuesday he's canceled talks with Iranian officials amid their protest crackdown and promised help to protesters in the country after human rights monitors said Tuesday that the death toll spiked to 2,000.

Trump did not offer any details about what the help would entail, but it comes after Trump said Iran wants to negotiate with Washington after his threat to strike the Islamic Republic. Trump's latest message on social media appeared to make an abrupt shift about his willingness to engage with the Iranian government.

“Iranian Patriots, KEEP PROTESTING - TAKE OVER YOUR INSTITUTIONS!!!” Trump wrote in morning post on Truth Socia. “Save the names of the killers and abusers. They will pay a big price. I have cancelled all meetings with Iranian Officials until the senseless killing of protesters STOPS. HELP IS ON ITS WAY.”

The Danish government official who confirmed the support on Tuesday was not authorized to comment publicly on the sensitive matter and spoke on the condition of anonymity. 

The official didn't provide details about the support, which comes at a moment of tension between the NATO allies as Trump repeatedly calls for the U.S. to take over Greenland, a self-governing Danish territory. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are set to meet Wednesday in Washington with Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen and his Greenlandic counterpart Vivian Motzfeldt to discuss the matter.

Officials with Denmark and Greenland have repeatedly said the island is not for sale and expressed frustration that Trump isn't ruling out military force to take the territory.

The White House and Pentagon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Danish support for the U.S. operation was first reported by Newsmax.

In a social media post, Trump defended the aggressive immigration enforcement actions being carried out across Minneapolis as part of his deportation agenda.

Throngs of people have taken to the streets of Minneapolis to protest the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers after a woman was shot and killed during an operation last Wednesday.

The president asserted in the post that the anti-ICE activity is also shifting the spotlight away from alleged fraud in the state and said, “FEAR NOT, GREAT PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA, THE DAY OF RECKONING & RETRIBUTION IS COMING!”

Trump blames what he calls “professional agitators” for the protests. He has not provided evidence to support his claims.

 “Michiganders are feeling the effects of Trump's economy every day,” Michigan Democratic Party chair Curtis Hertel said in a statement, singling out Republican opposition to extending health care subsidies.

“After spending months claiming that affordability was a ‘hoax' and creating a health care crisis for Michiganders, Donald Trump is now coming to Detroit — a city he hates — to tout his billionaire-first agenda while working families suffer,” Hertel said.

It won't be easy for Big Tech companies to win the hearts and minds of Americans who are angry about massive artificial intelligence data centers sprouting up in their neighborhoods, straining electricity grids and drawing on local reservoirs. 

Microsoft is trying anyway. The software giant's president, Brad Smith, is meeting with federal lawmakers Tuesday, pushing for the industry, not taxpayers, to pay the full costs of the vast network of computing warehouses needed to power AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Microsoft's own Copilot. Trump gave the effort a nod with a Truth Social post saying he doesn't want Americans to “pick up the tab” for data centers and pay higher utility costs. 

“Local communities naturally want to see new jobs but not at the expense of higher electricity prices or the diversion of their water,” Smith said in an interview with The Associated Press.

Central bankers from around the world said Tuesday they “stand in full solidarity” with U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, after President Donald Trump dramatically escalated his confrontation with the Fed with the Justice Department investigating and threatening criminal charges.

Powell “has served with integrity, focused on his mandate and an unwavering commitment to the public interest,” read the statement signed by nine national central bank heads including European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey.

They added that “the independence of central banks is a cornerstone of price, financial and economic stability in the interest of the citizens that we serve. It is therefore critical to preserve that independence, with full respect for the rule of law and democratic accountability.”

Inflation declined a bit last month as prices for gas and used cars fell, a sign that cost pressures are slowly easing.

Consumer prices rose 0.3% in December from the prior month, the Labor Department said Tuesday, the same as in November. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 0.2%, also matching November's figure.

Even as inflation has eased, the large price increases for necessities such as groceries, rent, and health care have left many American households feeling squeezed, turning “affordability” issues into high-profile political concerns.

Trump's administration has made good on its pledge to label the Lebanese, Jordanian and Egyptian chapters of the Muslim Brotherhood as terrorist organizations, imposing sanctions on them and their members. The decision could please the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, but complicate U.S. relations with allies Qatar and Turkey.

The State Department designated the Lebanese branch a foreign terrorist organization, the most severe of the labels, which makes it a criminal offense to provide material support to the group. Treasury listed the Jordanian and Egyptian branches as specially designated global terrorists for providing support to Hamas.

Nathan Brown, a professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University, said the sanctions may impact visa and asylum claims for people entering not just the U.S. but also Western European countries and Canada.

The Supreme Court is hearing arguments Tuesday over state laws barring transgender girls and women from playing on school athletic teams. Lower courts ruled for the transgender athletes in Idaho and West Virginia who challenged the state bans, but the conservative-dominated Supreme Court might not follow suit.

In just the past year, the justices ruled in favor of state bans on gender-affirming care for transgender youths and allowed multiple restrictions on transgender people to be enforced.

The legal fight is playing out amid a broad effort by Trump to target transgender Americans, beginning on the first day of his second term and including the ouster of transgender people from the military and declaring that gender is immutable and determined at birth.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday that Elon Musk's artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google's generative AI engine in operating inside the Pentagon network, as part of a broader push to feed as much of the military's data as possible into the developing technology.

“Very soon we will have the world's leading AI models on every unclassified and classified network throughout our department,” Hegseth said in a speech at Musk's space flight company, SpaceX, in South Texas.

The announcement comes just days after Grok — which is embedded into X, the social media network owned by Musk — drew global outcry and scrutiny for generating highly sexualized deepfake images of people without their consent.

Malaysia and Indonesia have blocked Grok, while the U.K.'s independent online safety watchdog announced an investigation Monday. Grok has limited image generation and editing to paying users.

Hegseth said Grok will go live inside the Defense Department later this month and announced that he would “make all appropriate data” from the military's IT systems available for “AI exploitation.” He also said data from intelligence databases would be fed into AI systems.

Trump has arrived at a delicate moment as he weighs whether to order a U.S. military response against the Iranian government as it continues a violent crackdown on protests. 

He has repeatedly threatened Tehran with military action if his administration found the Islamic Republic was using deadly force against antigovernment protesters. It's a red line that Trump has said he believes Iran is “starting to cross” and has left him and his national security team weighing “very strong options.”

But the U.S. military — which Trump has warned Tehran is “locked and loaded” — appears, at least for the moment, to have been placed on standby mode as Trump ponders next steps, saying that Iranian officials want to have talks with the White House.

Trump announced Monday on social media that he would slap 25% tariffs on countries doing business with Tehran “effective immediately” — his first action aimed at penalizing Iran for the protest crackdown, and his latest example of using tariffs as a tool to force friends and foes on the global stage to bend to his will.

The BBC plans to ask a court to throw out U.S. President Donald Trump's $10 billion lawsuit against the British broadcaster, court papers show.

Trump filed a lawsuit in December over the way the BBC edited a speech he gave on Jan. 6, 2021. The claim, filed in a Florida federal court, seeks $5 billion in damages for defamation and $5 billion for unfair trade practices.

The broadcaster has apologized to Trump over the edit of the Jan. 6 speech. But the publicly funded BBC rejects claims it defamed him. The furor triggered the resignations of the BBC's top executive and its head of news.

Papers filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Miami say the BBC will file a motion to dismiss the case on March 17 on the basis that the court lacks jurisdiction and Trump failed to state a claim.

The broadcaster's lawyers will argue that the BBC did not create, produce or broadcast the documentary in Florida and that Trump's claim the documentary was available in the U.S. on streaming service BritBox is not true.

Trump will travel to Michigan on Tuesday to promote his efforts to boost U.S. manufacturing, trying to counter fears about a weakening job market and worries that still-rising prices are taking a toll on Americans' pocketbooks.

The day trip will include a tour of a Ford factory in Dearborn that makes F-150 pickups, the bestselling domestic vehicle in the U.S. The Republican president is also set to address the Detroit Economic Club at the MotorCity Casino.

November's off-year elections showed a shift away from Republicans as public concerns about kitchen table issues persist. In their wake, the White House said Trump would put a greater emphasis on talking directly to the public about his economic policies after doing relatively few events around the country earlier in his term.

Trump's Michigan swing follows economy-focused speeches he gave last month in Pennsylvania — where his gripes about immigrants arriving to the U.S. from “filthy” countries got more attention than his pledges to fight inflation — and North Carolina, where he insisted his tariffs have spurred the economy, despite residents noting the squeeze of higher prices.

Former President Bill Clinton has responded after images of him were released from the latest Epstein files dump.

Former President Bill Clinton appears to have defied a congressional subpoena to appear before the House Oversight Committee on Tuesday morning.

Clinton was compelled to sit for a sworn closed-door deposition in the House's bipartisan probe into Jeffrey Epstein, but Fox News Digital did not see him before or after the scheduled 10 a.m. grilling.

House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., had threatened to begin contempt of Congress proceedings against Clinton if he did not appear Tuesday.

Comer said Tuesday morning, ""We will move next week in the House Oversight Committee … to hold Bill Clinton in contempt of Congress.""

""I think everyone knows by now Bill Clinton did not show up. And I think it's important to note that this subpoena was voted on in a bipartisan manner by this committee,"" Comer told reporters after formally ending the deposition.

""No one's accusing Bill Clinton of any wrongdoing. We just have questions. And that's why the Democrats voted, along with Republicans, to subpoena Bill Clinton.""

He said ""not a single Democrat"" showed up to the deposition on Tuesday.

DOJ SAYS LAWYERS WORKING 'AROUND THE CLOCK' TO PREP EPSTEIN FILES FOR RELEASE AFTER MISSED DEADLINE

Other lawmakers seen going into the committee room include Reps. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., Michael Cloud, R-Texas, Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., and Scott Perry, R-Pa.

Hillary Clinton had also been subpoenaed to appear on Wednesday but likely will not show up.

The Clintons' attorney sent Comer a letter confirming they're challenging the legality of the subpoenas issued against them.

""[T]he Subpoenas issued to President and Secretary Clinton are invalid and legally unenforceable. Mindful of these defects, we trust you will engage in good faith to de-escalate this dispute,"" reads the letter, obtained by Fox News Digital.

The Clintons' attorneys tore into Comer's leadership of the investigation, accusing him of violating the Constitution's separation of powers and trying to obfuscate the search for real information.

""President and Secretary Clinton have already provided the limited information they possess about Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell to the Committee. They did so proactively and voluntarily, and despite the fact that the Subpoenas are invalid and legally unenforceable, untethered to a valid legislative purpose, unwarranted because they do not seek pertinent information, and an unprecedented infringement on the separation of powers,"" the letter said.

""Your continued insistence that the former President and Secretary of State can be compelled to appear before the Committee under these circumstances, however, brings us toward a protracted and unnecessary legal confrontation that distracts from the principal work of the Congress with respect to this matter, which, if conducted sincerely, could help ensure the victims of Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell are afforded some measure of justice for the crimes perpetrated against them, however late. But perhaps distraction is the point.""

Fox News Digital asked Comer if he would also move to hold Hillary Clinton in contempt next week if she defies the subpoena, to which he said, ""We'll see. We'll talk about it.""

If the contempt resolution advances through committee next week, it will then be on the entire House to vote on whether to refer the former president for criminal charges.

A criminal contempt of Congress charge is a misdemeanor that carries a punishment of up to one year in jail and a maximum $100,000 fine if convicted.

Burchett, however, told reporters he was not confident that the Department of Justice (DOJ) would pursue such a referral.

""I've been really disappointed in our Justice Department, so I would hope that maybe they're making some changes over there,"" Burchett said.

The former first couple were two of 10 people who Comer initially subpoenaed in the House's Epstein investigation after a unanimous bipartisan vote directed him to do so last year. Fox News Digital was first to report on the subpoenas in August.

Clinton was known to be friendly with the late pedophile before his federal charges but was never implicated in any wrongdoing related to him.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","A Breathtaking Week of Pure Trump Id","https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/trump-venezuela-ice-minnesota-powell/685593/","Tue, 13 Jan 2026 01:27:00 GMT","

Military success in Venezuela has emboldened the president to flex his power even more.

Scarcely a week ago, U.S. warplanes and drones were streaking across the Caracas night sky to deliver a swift end to the reign of the Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro. The extraordinary display of kinetic violence delivered a stunning reminder about the reach of the world's most powerful military—and symbolized the start of a new chapter for the man who commands it.

Donald Trump has been emboldened. The president and his advisers believe that the strike both reignited his political momentum and underscored the lack of concrete limits on his ability to wield power at home and abroad. He blew past the need for congressional approval—or even notification—and has reveled in brandishing armed forces to intimidate foreign foes and friends alike. He seized upon a deadly confrontation on a cold Minnesota street to accelerate his push to put masked, armed federal officers in Democrat-run cities that didn't vote for him. And he brought his campaign of retribution against perceived political enemies to a new target, one that could undermine faith in the pillars of the nation's economy.

Even for Trump, it's been quite the week. But this is more than just a series of dizzying news cycles. The White House, after months of struggle, believes that it has found its footing again. Trump, though never restrained, is now pure id, acting on impulse and goaded on by advisers who see an opportunity to further expand executive power.

His poll numbers are still low, and the aura of invincibility that he held for the first half of last year is gone. The MAGA base has been fractured, and some Republicans have objected to his plans, while many more quietly worry that the president is ignoring the economic issues that will likely decide this year's midterm elections. But Trump simply doesn't care.

Steve Bannon, Trump's longtime adviser, put it to me this way: “It's a full flex.”

The first days of 2026 have been breathtaking in their share of Wait, he did what? headlines, cable chyrons, and news alerts. The Caracas strike, though rumored for weeks, happened so quickly that many Americans who'd gone to bed unaware that a capture operation was under way woke up to an image of Maduro wearing a Nike tracksuit and handcuffs. Trump then announced that the United States would “run” Venezuela—wait, what?—and also take much of its oil. The military's triumph then inspired the president and his advisers to renew a call to seize Greenland, thoroughly alarming European leaders who have watched in horror as Trump's desires for a strategically placed but largely uninhabited sheet of ice have escalated from social-media trolling to an existential threat against the NATO alliance. Where else could Trump wield American power? Perhaps in Iran, which has been engulfed by mass protests, leading the president to threaten action against an oppressive regime that has bedeviled the United States for nearly half a century.

Back home, an ICE agent in Minneapolis fired three bullets into the car of a 37-year-old mother who had been protesting deportation operations. Trump, instead of calling for national unity at a time of tragedy, blamed the victim, and his administration sent more armed officers to the city. And his retribution campaign—faltering to this point, to be sure—targeted the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who is now the subject of a Justice Department investigation. The normally soft-spoken Jerome Powell called it payback for a disagreement on interest rates and warned that Trump had jeopardized the Fed's independence, perceived by many as the bedrock of American financial stability.

Oh, and for good measure, the White House launched a website on January 6 that thoroughly twisted the facts of the 2021 insurrection, as Trump, once more, suggested that U.S. elections, including the upcoming midterms, could be rigged. The next day, Trump sat for a two-hour interview with a newspaper he often derides to express regret for not seizing voting machines in 2020 and to bemoan the impact of civil-rights legislation on white people.

Read: Donald Trump wants you to forget this happened

“It's insane,” Senator Mark Warner of Virginia told me, as he recapped the events of the past week, including the threats against Powell and Greenland. “This is beyond ludicrous. What is he even talking about? At what point is enough enough?”

Many second-term presidents, coming to grips with their fate as a lame duck, turn to an area in which they have the most unilateral control: foreign policy. Yet it's been surprising to see how firmly Trump has embraced a new plan of international action. He campaigned in 2016 against so-called forever wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and pledged to avoid such military entanglements. But then he fell in love with the “one and done” strategy of a quick burst of military action—such as the bombing of Iran's nuclear facilities last June—and blustered about Maduro for months before green-lighting the strike.

He surprised many—and outraged the isolationist factions of his base—by repeatedly declaring that the U.S. would be heavily involved in Venezuela for years. Besotted with Venezuela's ability to flood the market with oil, Trump has set up what critics say is an extortionist racket of the South American nation. He has told its new leader, in essence, Give us the oil we want, and we'll let you stay in power, and has privately joked that Venezuela could be in the running to become the 51st state, two people close to him told me.

Read: Trump seizing Greenland could set off a chain reaction

There's likely more to come. Some in the administration believe that Cuba could be next, and White House aides told me that Trump will be briefed tomorrow on an array of options for intervention in Iran, including some military operations that are ostensibly meant to protect the protesters but that could also hasten the end of the regime. Trump has repeatedly refused to rule out using military force to seize Greenland, even though it could shatter the globe's most enduring and successful alliance. Greenland is part of Denmark, a fellow member of NATO (Article 5 of NATO's charter declares that an attack on one is an attack on all). European leaders are so spooked by Trump's bellicose rhetoric that they've publicly rebuked the United States. Germany and the United Kingdom are considering troop deployments to Greenland. Trump, though, seems unbothered by the blowback to his threat to redraw the world's maps. Making a deal instead of using force would be “easier,” the president told reporters last night on Air Force One, adding, “But one way or the other, we're going to have Greenland.”

Trump, of course, is no stranger to the strategy of flooding the zone with outrageous statements and acts, making it hard for his political opponents and the media (not to mention the general public) to keep track. White House aides and close allies privately acknowledged to me that they have been grateful to control the news cycle in the early days of 2026.

But Trump is still set to begin the second year of his term far weaker than he was in the first. He is an unpopular president, per polling, and most Americans dislike both the strong-arm deportation tactics at the center of the Minneapolis protests and Trump's efforts to use the Department of Justice to carry out his political vendettas. West Wing aides have been eager to shift the conversation away from the ongoing Jeffrey Epstein controversy, which, when it erupted over the summer, was the first moment when many Republican lawmakers seemed willing to defy Trump. (The DOJ has repeatedly missed deadlines to release all of the materials in the case; the story will likely spring back to life when more comes out in the weeks ahead.) The White House has also begun to take on its thorniest political issue: high prices. As part of its news blitz this month, the Trump administration has unveiled measures meant to drive down the costs of prescription drugs and credit-card fees, as well as to make mortgages more obtainable.

Read: Does Congress even exist anymore?

The White House spokesperson Kush Desai told me in a statement that the blitz is part of the administration's work in “implementing the free market policies like tax cuts and deregulation that do work rectifying the ‘America Last' policies that have let Americans down.”

But some in the GOP remain concerned that Trump is distracted and that the flurry of foreign-policy flexing will be a sugar high that wears off quickly. Others have urged him to stop meddling with allies. Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, in a floor speech last week, said that he was “sick of stupid” and urged Trump to focus on his domestic legacy.

Indeed, Republican lawmakers have sent word to the White House that affordability, not military interventionism, remains top of mind for their constituents, and that voters don't much care about what's going in distant lands such as Venezuela and Iran—and can find Greenland on the map only because it's drawn disproportionately large.

Greenland:

Uncertainty around US President Donald Trump's plans for Greenland has helped push the Danish krone to its weakest in six years, fueling speculation the central bank will step in to support it.

The currency has emerged as a way for investors to wager on the chances of the US administration taking ownership of the territory, which is controlled by Denmark, with all the geopolitical turbulence that would entail. At the same time, the krone is a managed currency, and the Danish central bank has reserves equivalent to more than $100 billion it can tap to keep it within a trading band.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Eric Adams:

Eric Adams' fondness for crypto — which during his one-term tenure as mayor of New York included the launch of the ill-fated ‘NYCCoin'  — is once again attracting controversy.

Less than two weeks after being succeeded by Zohran Mamdani, Adams re-emerged to promote a new city-inspired cryptoasset called NYC Token. A portion of the proceeds would go to fight antisemitism and educate children about the blockchain, Adams said during appearances in Times Square and on the Fox Business television channel.

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains the most lethal urologic cancer. Accurate, rapid diagnosis is critical for effective management and slowing disease progression.

In modern primary care practice, most RCC cases are detected as incidental findings during abdominal ultrasound or CT performed for nonrenal indications, such as gallbladder evaluation, vague abdominal pain, or trauma assessment.

Although less often comparatively, patients present with the classic triad of flank pain, gross hematuria, and a palpable mass that prompts appropriate testing.

Elevated creatinine levels do not reliably indicate early RCC as many noncancer factors can influence this marker, such as acute kidney injury. While RCC is associated with paraneoplastic syndromes, these systemic manifestations are less common than asymptomatic presentation and can resolve spontaneously, which potentially interferes with workup.

Learn more about RCC presentation.

Multiphasic contrast-enhanced CT (including unenhanced, corticomedullary, nephrographic, and excretory phases) or multiparametric contrast-enhanced MRI are the recommended modalities for previously detected renal masses. CT scan characterizes vascularity and differentiating between simple cysts, complex cysts, and solid neoplasms in indeterminate renal masses. MRI is particularly useful for patients with iodine allergies, renal insufficiency, or when reducing radiation exposure is a priority.

18F-FDG PET is not part of the standard diagnostic workup for primary renal masses or this setting due certain limitations, such as variable glucose metabolism of RCC (leading to false negatives) and physiologic excretion of tracer by the kidneys (obscuring the lesion). However, this method has demonstrated efficacy in metastatic and recurrent RCC settings.

Percutaneous biopsy is generally reserved for specific scenarios after imaging has already characterized the mass as solid and indeterminate; it is not the primary tool for distinguishing or characterizing masses.

Learn more about RCC differential diagnoses.

Bone scans are usually not part of the initial staging workup for patients with RCC. They are typically reserved for patients with signs suggestive of skeletal metastasis, such as bone pain or elevated alkaline phosphatase levels.

Hypercalcemia is a common paraneoplastic finding in RCC but does not independently warrant a bone scan in the absence of skeletal symptoms.

Flank pain is a symptom associated with the primary tumor and generally prompts abdominal imaging rather than a bone scan.

Tumor size guides T-staging, but size alone does not mandate a bone scan, especially if the patient is asymptomatic and has normal alkaline phosphatase levels.

Learn more about RCC diagnosis.

For newly diagnosed RCC, evaluation of the chest and abdomen is a critical component of the staging workup. This can be performed with CT or chest radiography. Contrast-enhanced CT and MRI is preferred for assessing clinically localized renal masses.

Bone scans are reserved for patients with bone pain or elevated alkaline phosphatase, and brain MRI is obtained only for patients who exhibit neurologic symptoms.

According to the American Urological Association, ""PET scan has a very limited role in the routine evaluation or staging of RCC.""

Learn more about RCC staging.

For advanced RCC, neuroimaging (via CT or MRI) may be considered prior to the initiating systemic therapy, especially to evaluate for brain metastases. Researchers have started that CT and MRI in this setting have a ""critical role in the diagnosis and treatment process, providing important insights into each subtype's unique clinical course and prognosis.""

Whole-body MRI and renal scintigraphy are usually not recommended as a routine additional imaging modality in patients with advanced RCC before starting systemic therapy and are more often utilized in select cases; however, renal scintigraphy may be a potential option in patients at risk for future renal impairment owing to comorbid disorders.

EXCLUSIVE: Michelle Williams is the latest star to join Damien Chazelle‘s new untitled drama starring Cillian Murphy and Daniel Craig. Chazelle will direct and has written the script and will also produce alongside Olivia Hamilton under their Wild Chickens Productions banner. Paramount Pictures will distribute the film. 


	While unconfirmed, insiders say the film will be set in a prison.


	Production is expected to start later this year. Chazelle had been weighing several projects last year including an Evel Knievel pic with Leonardo DiCaprio circling the lead role. That film ultimately pushed allowing Chazelle to pivot to his prison pic that he was also developing. Once Murphy and Craig were committed to star the film was off to the races with Chazelle beginning to court stars for other roles. Following the success of films like Whiplash and La La Land, stars are always intrigued when one of his scripts hits the market and this case was no different with Williams signing on right before the holiday.

	











	Williams is coming off her Golden Globe win for best female actor in a limited series or movie for her critically acclaimed performance in Dying For Sex. The performance also earned her an Emmy nomination. On the film side, she most recently portrayed Mitzi Fableman, a character inspired by Steven Spielberg's mother in The Fabelmans (2022), a role which earned her a Golden Globe nomination and her fifth Academy Award nomination.
