                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Senate Banking Committee's Jan 15 markup could grant XRP, SOL, and DOGE "Bitcoin-like" status. While Bitcoin has long enjoyed regulatory clarity as a commodity, the bill outlines a framework that may extend similar treatment to other large-cap tokens such as XRP, Solana (SOL), Hedera (HBAR), Chainlink (LINK), and Dogecoin (DOGE). This shift could meaningfully reshape the outlook for spot altcoin ETFs. At the core of the proposal is a clear legal distinction between digital commodities and securities, paired with a presumption that sufficiently decentralized network tokens should not be regulated as investment contracts. This approach directly addresses years of regulatory uncertainty that have held back institutional adoption and product development. Crucially, network tokens are explicitly treated as non-securities for purposes of federal securities laws, provided they do not grant holders traditional financial rights such as equity, debt claims, dividends, or liquidation preferences. This definition closely aligns with how regulators currently perceive Bitcoin. For assets such as XRP, SOL, HBAR, LINK, and DOGE, this represents a critical shift. Each powers a live blockchain network with broad participation, transaction utility, and decentralized governance elements. The bill acknowledges that value appreciation driven by network activity or decentralized governance does not, by itself, make a token a security. Section 4B(b)(2) provides that secondary market sales of network tokens do not constitute securities transactions, so long as they are not part of an investment contract tied to an issuer's ongoing efforts. This is critical: it removes the legal overhang that has historically blocked spot ETF approvals for many altcoins. Once a network is certified as not subject to common control, its associated token benefits from strong legal presumptions: This framework is particularly relevant for XRP and Solana, both of which have faced scrutiny over whether early development teams retained excessive influence. The bill establishes a formal, transparent pathway for regulators to recognize when networks mature beyond issuer dependence, a feature that has been largely absent from prior enforcement-driven approaches. A newly highlighted section of proposed digital asset legislation introduces a meaningful regulatory classification for certain crypto tokens, designating them as “non-ancillary assets” based on their inclusion in exchange-traded products (ETPs) as of Jan. 1, 2026. Overall, the provision reflects a pragmatic approach by lawmakers: rather than re-examining the status of widely traded, exchange-listed crypto assets, it treats ETP inclusion as sufficient evidence of non-ancillary status, effectively expanding Bitcoin- and Ethereum-like treatment to a broader set of tokens under U.S. securities law . Notably, the bill also includes explicit exemptions and waivers for exchange-traded products and passive investment vehicles, allowing them to operate without triggering insider resale restrictions that apply to token insiders. This provision appears tailored to accommodate ETFs and similar institutional products. Another significant implication for ETF viability is the bill's treatment of secondary market transactions. This even if the token arrived initially through an investment contract. This is a direct response to concerns raised in past enforcement actions, where regulators blurred the line between primary issuance and secondary trading. By separating the two, the legislation provides a clearer legal basis for exchanges, market makers, and ETF issuers to support liquidity without inheriting issuer-level regulatory risk. Regulatory clarity tends to reduce risk premiums, attract institutional capital, and support product innovation. The SEC retains authority to define decentralization thresholds, enforce anti-fraud rules, and oversee disclosure during transitional periods. Markets should not expect immediate approvals, but the structural barriers are clearly going to be lower. More broadly, the Senate Banking Committee's draft signals a philosophical shift away from regulating crypto primarily through enforcement actions. Instead, it adopts a rules-based, technology-neutral framework that acknowledges how decentralized networks actually operate. By placing XRP, SOL, HBAR, LINK, DOGE, and similar assets on a regulatory footing closer to Bitcoin, the bill acknowledges that the crypto market has evolved beyond a binary “security vs. non-security” debate. For investors, developers, and ETF issuers alike, that shift could prove transformative. If passed, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act may be remembered not just as a regulatory cleanup but also as a landmark piece of legislation. Large-cap tokens such as XRP, Solana (SOL), Hedera (HBAR), Chainlink (LINK), and Dogecoin (DOGE) could benefit if they qualify as decentralized “network tokens” under the bill's definitions. Still, it creates a legal category for decentralized network tokens that would be treated as digital commodities rather than securities, similar to Bitcoin. Greater regulatory clarity around commodity status could lower legal and compliance barriers for spot altcoin ETFs, making approvals more likely, though not guaranteed.</p>

NFT Paris was positioned as one of Europe's flagship NFT conferences, bringing together artists, marketplaces, brands and Web3 startups for panels, exhibitions and deal-making. NFT activity continues in 2026, but volumes are lower, and demand is more price-sensitive. Conference economics often reveal market health in ways sales charts cannot. NFT usage is shifting toward utility and infrastructure, while hype-driven formats are fading. NFT Paris, one of Europe's better-known non-fungible token (NFT) gatherings, was abruptly called off for 2026, alongside its sister event, RWA Paris, roughly a month before it was due to run. A conference cancellation does not measure the NFT market in the same way a sales chart does, but it can reveal something else: whether there is still enough demand, sponsorship budget and industry momentum to keep large-scale NFT events economically viable. NFT Paris was positioned as one of Europe's flagship NFT conferences, bringing together artists, marketplaces, brands and Web3 startups for panels, exhibitions and deal-making. Some sponsors said they would not receive refunds, even as the event reiterated its ticket-refund timeline. Large Web3 conferences typically rely heavily on sponsorships to justify venue, production and programming costs. On the money side, aggregated market data has been weak compared to earlier cycles. DappRadar's reporting on 2025 highlighted a pattern in which sales counts rose even as average prices and headline volumes remained comparatively subdued. The report also noted that many NFTs were trading at lower values than before. Taken together, the “state of the NFT market” heading into 2026 looks compressed and price-sensitive: There are plenty of transactions, far less sponsor-friendly hype and liquidity concentrated in fewer places. These include incentive programs, thin liquidity or a handful of high-ticket sales that do not reflect the wider market. A conference, by contrast, lives or dies on whether the industry is willing to pay to gather, through ticket demand, exhibitor spending and especially sponsorship budgets. In the event business, sponsorships and expo revenue are often treated as core pillars. Trade show analysts also note that many events earn most of their revenue from exhibitors rather than ticket sales. Even in a down market, NFTs have not disappeared so much as shifted into narrower, utility-led niches. Ticketmaster has promoted “token-gated” sales, where holding a specific NFT can unlock presales, upgraded seats or packaged experiences. This positions NFTs as access credentials rather than standalone collectibles. NFTs were sold as lifetime festival access with VIP-style perks, tying ownership to something tangible rather than a resale narrative. At the same time, several high-profile consumer brands have scaled back or sunset NFT-style loyalty pilots. Starbucks confirmed it would end its Odyssey program on March 31, 2024, framing the move as a step to “prepare for what comes next.” Marketplace consolidation, incentives and the pivot away from “NFT-only” Another reason a flagship conference can struggle is that the NFT economy it was built around is no longer centered on NFT marketplaces as a standalone category. OpenSea, for instance, has been publicly repositioning itself beyond its original identity. Multiple researchers and analysts have linked parts of the post-2022 NFT volume story to incentive-driven activity, which can boost headline numbers without necessarily reflecting new end-user demand. Blur is an NFT marketplace built for professional traders. Its use of points and token airdrops helped it briefly dominate NFT trading volume in 2023, an example analysts often cite to show how incentives can inflate activity without signaling broader user demand. NFT Paris cancellation can be seen as a snapshot of the market's current economics. It does not, on its own, indicate market terminality. Against a backdrop in which monthly NFT sales volumes were widely reported to be far below prior highs, the event's failure to pencil out fits a market with less discretionary spending. Whether brands and sponsors return with measurable product goals Whether NFTs show up as “invisible infrastructure” inside games, ticketing or loyalty.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lee projects Bitmine's staking income could reach $374M annually once MAVAN launches in early 2026. ETH reaching $32,000 (10x) would require a $3.8T market cap larger than Apple's current valuation. Investors rethink ‘hands off' investing and decide to start making real money Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) enters 2026 under intense institutional spotlight, and Tom Lee believes a supercycle is unfolding. The Fundstrat co-founder and Bitmine chairman has made increasingly aggressive Ethereum price predictions, ranging from $7,000-$9,000 near-term to as high as $60,000 over the long haul. Lee's firm recently added $88 million in ETH at roughly $3,200 per token, pushing Bitmine's total holdings past 4.17 million ETH—about 3.45% of Ethereum's circulating supply. Lee frames the purchase as a bet on infrastructure—not speculation. With staking yields, network fees, and Layer-2 scaling driving recurring demand, he argues Ethereum could deliver a 100x return from current levels, mirroring Bitcoin's trajectory since Fundstrat first recommended it in 2017. Lee frames the Ethereum supercycle as a multi-year adoption wave driven by institutions rather than retail speculation. In his view, the Ethereum supercycle marks a shift where traditional finance, regulation, and blockchain infrastructure begin moving in the same direction. That alignment didn't exist in earlier cycles, which were shorter and more sentiment-driven. The comparison to Bitcoin's 2017-2021 run is deliberate but limited. Ethereum's path is different—its value comes from daily use. It settles stablecoins, supports lending markets, and underpins tokenized assets that institutions already interact with. "We believe ETH is embarking on that same Supercycle," Lee said in November 2025. The distinction is central to his thesis: Ethereum is growing less like a trade and more like infrastructure, with demand tied to activity rather than headlines. Bitmine's $88 million purchase wasn't about timing the bottom. Lee has been explicit that accumulating during year-end tax-loss selling reflects a structural view, not a short-term price call. The firm now holds over 4.17 million ETH—approximately 3.45% of Ethereum's circulating supply—with ambitions to reach 5%. Backing from Peter Thiel's Founders Fund and Cathie Wood's ARK Invest signals institutional confidence in the strategy. Once the firm's MAVAN validator network launches in early 2026, Lee projects staking income could reach $374 million per year—over $1 million daily. At $3,200 per ETH, that represents recurring cash flow, not just price speculation. Ten times current prices would put Ethereum at $32,000—implying a market cap near $3.8 trillion. If supply grows from roughly $200 billion toward the $2 trillion level projected by policymakers, Ethereum captures meaningful settlement activity. Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick projects ETH reaching $7,500 in 2026, $30,000 by 2029, and $40,000 by 2030—suggesting 10x returns are achievable within a four-year window. At Binance Blockchain Week in December 2025, he called ETH at $3,000 "severely undervalued" and has floated $60,000 as a bull case driven by real-world asset tokenization. His most aggressive prediction: $250,000 long-term, implying 78x returns from current levels. For context, ETH reaching $32,000 would require consistent institutional ETF inflows sustaining through multiple years, tokenized money market funds expanding Ethereum's role as settlement infrastructure, and Layer-2 scaling continuing without competitive displacement from Solana or other alternatives. The network hosts over $50 billion in total value locked across DeFi protocols, dwarfing competitors. Layer-2 networks like Arbitrum and Optimism scale transaction throughput while keeping settlement on mainnet. EIP-1559's fee-burning mechanism creates deflationary pressure during high-usage periods. When activity rises, more ETH gets permanently removed while staking locks additional supply. Fundstrat's internal 2026 outlook, written by analyst Sean Farrell, warned clients to expect a "meaningful drawdown" in H1 2026, with ETH potentially falling to $1,800-$2,000 before recovering. The firm's year-end 2026 target sits at $4,500—far below Lee's public rhetoric. Shares have fallen over 50% since September even as ETH holdings appreciated, raising questions about whether treasury strategies translate into shareholder value. Critics like Eurointelligence's Wolfgang Münchau called borrowing to buy volatile assets "downright stupid." Yet Lee's core thesis doesn't require perfection. Ethereum generates fees, supports stablecoin settlement at scale, and anchors tokenized assets institutions actively use. The path to 10x depends on verifiable milestones: sustained ETF inflows above $300 million monthly, Bitmine's staking deployment materializing projected yields, and stablecoin expansion continuing without regulatory disruption. That realization hits like a lightning bolt when you realize not just how much better your returns could be, but that there are amazing offers like one app where new self-directed investing accounts funded with as little as $50 can receive stock worth up to $1,000.</p>

In addition, the government has committed to informing “civil servants of the real-world consequences of inadvertent personal data breaches by developing and delivering ongoing and engaging communication campaigns”. The MOU was signed on 9 January, but the intention to formalise an agreement was first announced in October last year by information commissioner John Edwards. Edwards said then that the agreement would ensure that government's plans to use new technologies to transform public services would be carried out “with the appropriate safeguards in place”.

On 6 January it published the Government Cyber Action Plan, which sets out how it plans to strengthen cyber defences and digital resilience across departments and the wider public sector. Ian Murray, the minister of state for the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, said in the foreword to the plan: “Hostile states and criminal groups are actively probing our defences, seeking to disrupt our way of life and undermine our national interest.We must be clear eyed about what is at stake.” The plan outlines how government will take what it called “proactive, risk-led action with clear accountability, mandatory requirements, and comprehensive central support” to strengthen public sector infrastructure.Steered by a new agency, the Government Cyber Unit, the plan correlates with the UK government's work to digitise public services so that “phone queues and paperwork” no longer obstruct citizens' access to support. The government envisages that this digitisation could unlock up to £45bn [US$60.6bn] in productivity savings.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The information watchdog is questioning Lloyds Banking Group over a potential breach of privacy rules after it accessed data from 30,000 staff bank accounts during union pay talks last year. Lloyds – which owns the Halifax and Bank of Scotland brands – used aggregated salary, spending and savings data as part of a presentation to staff union representatives, which suggested that its lowest-paid staff had been in a better financial position than the wider population in recent years. The banking group's 65,000 staff are strongly urged to hold their personal account with Lloyds, meaning the lender could access financial information without permission. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has confirmed it is making “inquiries” with Lloyds over whether it may have breached data privacy rules as a result. It comes as the bank's chief executive, Charlie Nunn, is lined up for a pay package that could be worth more than £13m, helped by the UK's controversial decision to lift a cap on banker bonuses. The bank's remuneration committee has begun drafting a three-year executive pay policy that will take advantage of looser rules which have sent potential payouts soaring at rival banks. Lloyds, which had been locked in pay negotiations with staff unions, ultimately agreed on a £1,200 pay rise for its lowest-paid staff for each of 2026 and 2027, representing a 7%-9% increase over the two years. Accord, one of Lloyds' staff unions, said Lloyds had assured it that the information was fully aggregated, and that no individual information was reviewed by negotiators. “Understandably, given the confusion and concern, the ICO is looking into what Lloyds Banking Group (LBG) did and whether it broke any data laws,” Accord said. The ICO carries a number of powers to punish data breaches, including formal reprimands, mandatory audits of data handling, and fines that can be worth up to 4% of a company's annual turnover. “Even if the ICO finds that no data privacy rules were breached, LBG needs to learn lessons. Critically, LBG needs to ensure this kind of situation (and the confusion and concern it has caused) is not repeated.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US Senators Cynthia Lummis and Ron Wyden on Monday unveiled the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, bipartisan legislation that would exempt non-custodial blockchain developers and infrastructure providers from federal money transmitter rules. The bill aims to protect innovation, maintain consistency with federal guidance, and prevent non-custodial developers from being treated like banks or financial intermediaries. Under the proposal, developers who write software, maintain distributed ledgers, or provide supporting infrastructure, but do not control users' funds, would not be treated as money transmitters under federal law. “Blockchain developers who have simply written code and maintained open-source infrastructure have lived under the threat of being classified as money transmitters for far too long,” said Lummis, who chairs the Senate Banking Digital Assets Subcommittee. “This designation makes no sense when they never touch, control, or have access to user funds, and unnecessarily limits innovation,” she said. “Forcing developers who write code to follow the same rules as exchanges or brokers is technologically illiterate and a recipe for violating Americans' privacy and free speech rights,” he said. The legislation also seeks to harmonize federal standards with state laws while offering regulatory certainty to stimulate the US digital finance sector. Under current law, many developers face regulatory uncertainty that has driven innovation offshore and subjected them to conflicting state rules. In these cases, prosecutors successfully argued that maintaining and governing code can qualify developers as ‘financial institutions,' making them subject to the Bank Secrecy Act in the same way as traditional banks. Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm was convicted in 2025 of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, while Samourai Wallet founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill pled guilty to similar charges.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Photo Credit: Steve Aoki by Stephen McCarthy for Collision via Sportsfile / CC by 2.0 Now that the hype surrounding cryptocurrency-backed non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has mostly died down, it's rare that they pop up in the news anymore except as the subject of a lawsuit. That's certainly the case with cake-throwing DJ Steve Aoki, who has been named in a class action lawsuit alleging he used his social media influence to promote NFTs from a now-defunct company without disclosing that he was being paid to do so. MetaZoo Games, which was initially founded in 2000 to sell a collectible card game, has sold skate gear and clothing as well as NFTs. During the peak of the NFT craze, the company was selling a full set of 10 MetaZoo Coin NFTs for 20 Ethereum, which was worth around $80,000 at the time. “There is a specific set of rules that are in place to protect consumers, and it's of great importance that influencers know and understand those rules, because they are requirements and not suggestions,” said Berger in a statement to Law.com. “There are a number of class actions now against viable companies where the same thing has happened.” That same year, Aoki said he'd made more money from NFTs than he had in a decade of music royalties. MetaZoo filed for bankruptcy in January 2024. You must be logged in to post a comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Large technology partnerships often look procedural: paperwork, coordination, and timelines that stretch further than a news cycle. That's part of why Saudi Arabia's agreement between WhiteBIT and Durrah AIFodah is easy to underestimate at first glance, even though the scope suggests something more structured is taking shape. WhiteBIT is a major European cryptocurrency exchange, and the partnership ties its technical expertise to Saudi Arabia's Vision 20230 priorities through Durrah AIFodah Holding. The agreement focuses on blockchain infrastructure, digital finance, and national-scale data systems. These are all areas that Saudi Arabia has been steadily building out. Saudi Arabia's interest in blockchain shows up as infrastructure planning. National data computing centers, blockchain processing capacity, and sovereign digital currency research all point toward the same concern: control over systems that increasingly underpin economic activity. The balance is important, given that technical capability alone doesn't move national projects forward, and neither does access without systems that grow responsibly. This is particularly important in regions where cross-border settlement standards are still forming. Sure, some companies isolate their digital currency research, but the partnership places it alongside broader financial infrastructure work. While these arrangements don't look like traditional diplomacy, they often carry similar weight. Over time, they influence how platforms integrate smoothly and which markets open with fewer frictions. Agreements like this one make it tangible as digital finance becomes part of economic restructuring. Each of them points back to domestic capacity and long-term resilience. Nosov stated, “It is an honor to work alongside the Holding of His Royal Highness Prince Naif Bin Abdullah Bin Saud to build the foundations of Saudi Arabia's digital transformation. Together, we aim to establish and secure sovereign blockchain systems that will shape the Kingdom's technological future.” The agreement reinforces a shared focus on systems designed to last, adapt, and remain under national oversight. For Saudi Arabia, deals like this are all about preparation. The impact tends to surface gradually, through infrastructure that becomes ordinary.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The document details a range of underlying principles agreed upon by both government and the ICO, as well outlining actions that each will take – individually and jointly. The two parties have committed to “work together to ensure the public can see real benefits in sharing their data and trust that it will be protected” and also to “work collaboratively and transparently, taking a ‘no surprises' approach”. Other clear actions enshrined in the new agreement include the establishment of “a clear process for responding to a personal data breach” – which all civil servants will be asked to follow. Government will also “seek the ICO's expert advice when it has identified that the use of personal data in the delivery of a policy or a system carries a significant risk” and take steps to “ensure that, at all times, there is an accountable and named individual responsible… for managing cross-government data protection risk and compliance” – a responsibility which is currently held by the government chief data officer, Aimee Smith. Other, less measurable commitments include a promise to focus on “prioritising public trust and confidence in the government's handling of personal data” and to help cultivate “a cross-government culture of continuous learning around improving information security”. All of Whitehall's commitments will be supported by efforts to “track key indicators that monitor civil service maturity and awareness of information management”. Another pledge contained in the MOU is to “provide regulatory certainty by producing timely and relevant products including guidance, codes of practice, advice notes, opinions and audits that support government and the public sector to use people's data safely”. Other commitments set out in the arrangement include a stipulation that the data regulator will “provide independent and expert advice in response to government raising a substantial risk” and, finally, that it “will recognise that senior responsible officers in DSIT and Cabinet Office are responsible for driving collaboration between departments and… will work with both officers to support that”. Following the publication of the MOU – which was undersigned by security minister Dan Jarvis, digital government minister Ian Murray, and information commissioner John Edwards – the ICO issued a statement claiming that the new arrangement has come in light of “several serious, high-profile data breaches that undermined public trust in government, some of which also placed lives at risk”.
