                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Here's a thought experiment that's been growing on me, and I'm curious how this community sees it. A few physicists and philosophers have proposed that consciousness might be a fundamental field woven into spacetime — something brains interface with rather than generate. In that view, consciousness isn't produced by neurons; neurons are just the biological hardware that tune into a deeper substrate. What if dark matter is the physical footprint of that consciousness field? • permeates the universe • interacts gravitationally • doesn't interact with light • forms large‑scale structures • is completely invisible A consciousness field would behave the same way: non‑electromagnetic, pervasive, and detectable only through its influence on spacetime. If that's true, then a sufficiently advanced civilization might not use propulsion at all. That could explain UAP behavior without breaking physics: • inertia‑free acceleration • instantaneous direction changes • silent movement • non‑ballistic trajectories • apparent “awareness” of observers Just a deeper layer of physics we haven't mapped yet. When it comes to the most convincing UFO sightings ever reported, opinions on Reddit are varied and passionate. Here are some of the most frequently mentioned and compelling cases: Quote: "The Ariel school incident in Africa is my favourite. Description: Military personnel at RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge in Suffolk, England, reported seeing unusual lights and a metallic object in Rendlesham Forest. Description: U.S. Navy pilots, including David Fravor, encountered a "tic tac" shaped object that displayed incredible speed and maneuverability off the coast of California. The incident was captured on FLIR footage and corroborated by multiple witnesses. Description: Thousands of people across Arizona, including the governor, witnessed a series of lights in a V-formation moving silently across the night sky. Description: Iranian military pilots had a multi-hour encounter with a UFO that was tracked on radar and caused instrumentation and communications failures on their F-4 jets. Military personals, radars and civilian plane encountered the UFO." Description: A JAL cargo pilot and his crew witnessed a massive UFO and two smaller objects over Alaska, which were also tracked by ground radar. Quote: "Japan Air Lines flight 1628 incident & Belgian UFO wave" The photos were analyzed and found to be consistent with early 2000s digital camera artifacts. The object emitted a low hum and rumbling noises. Description: Multiple videos from different angles showed a pyramid-shaped object floating over the Pentagon. The footage was featured on television shows but did not receive widespread attention. Description: Several witnesses in Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia, saw a large object crash into the water, leaving a yellowish foam. These sightings are among the most credible and well-documented UFO incidents, supported by multiple witnesses, radar data, and even military testimony. While they remain unexplained, they provide compelling evidence that there may be more to the UFO phenomenon than meets the eye.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A small town in California was hit by earthquakes once every 22 years for over a century, setting the stage for a major seismic experiment in the 1980s and 90s. But the quake ended up being 11 years late. In this excerpt from "When Worlds Quake," geophysicist Hrvoje Tkalčić looks at why predicting earthquakes is so difficult. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Predicting earthquakes before they happen is currently impossible, but scientists are edging closer and closer with new and innovative ways to monitor movements in Earth's crust. You can often read rude and even vulgar comments under online newspaper articles about the purpose of the seismological profession when people in their post-earthquake trauma realize that seismologists don't forecast like meteorologists do, such as forecast hail or tornadoes with high accuracy. An approximate answer to these comments could be given with the following targeted question: "We still can't beat malignant diseases, but should we stop researching because of that?" We are used to discussions about earthquake causes after every event, particularly in the places where the world's earthquakes occur. There are discussions about their frequency, and quite often, there are those who claim they could recognize the coming earthquake in something else. Whether it's a full moon, a planetary conjunction, too much rainfall, bone pain, overexploitation of the planet's resources or greed, people tend to believe that earthquakes have simpler explanations than physical forces in the interior of the Earth and, of course, that they can be predicted. Let's travel to California in the 1970s and 80s, to a small, picturesque town of only 18 inhabitants — Parkfield — located between San Francisco and Los Angeles, near the central part of the San Andreas Fault. Well, this small town is known to the seismological world for its turbulent geological history. Namely, on average, significant earthquakes have occurred in Parkfield every 22 years since the middle of the 18th century. In addition, the 1934 and 1966 earthquakes had foreshocks — about 17 minutes before the main shock — whose seismograms also looked very similar. You wonder how such a thing is even possible. Such similarity of seismograms is possible only if the same fault surface is always activated and recorded with the same instrument at sufficiently long waves. In other words, you have a source — an earthquake and a receiver — a seismometer at fixed locations, and waves propagating between them through the same material. So, you have a perfect natural laboratory and an experiment set up in it. You just have to wait long enough. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Scientists, therefore, had good maps in hand to investigate the mechanisms of earthquakes that recur from time to time on an active, well-monitored fault. They forecasted with 90 to 95% confidence that the next earthquake there would occur between 1985 and 1993. Do earthquakes repeat at an average time interval, or is each earthquake unique, a story in itself? In those years, I worked once a week with colleagues at the U.S. Geological Survey California office in Menlo Park, in the northwestern part of Silicon Valley, where I was able to observe some scientists involved in the experiment. Eventually, a magnitude 6.0 earthquake did happen in Parkfield, but not until 2004. We greeted the most watched and studied earthquake in human history with a huge question mark above our heads; it occurred 11 years after its forecasted time. But, as they say, only those who dare to fail eventually succeed. Each fault is different — some of them we know about, but many we don't — earthquake catalogs don't go back far enough, and, after all, underground architecture is entirely invisible to us. We do not know how deep the fault reaches, whether it is a flat or curved surface, whether its surface is smooth or rough, whether and where it touches other faults, the chemical composition of the rocks on one and the other side of the fault, or their physical properties, for example, strength and porosity. We also do not know many other factors. A forecast can be made, but by its very nature, it must be probabilistic and taken with a grain of salt. The first good news is that seismic hazard maps exist in most countries. Ironically, earthquakes help us because they serve as a source of waves illuminating the Earth's interior. It is possible to predict infrastructure behavior during earthquakes due to the development of engineering, construction, computer science and numerical methods. Either way, those hazard maps serve as input for engineers, builders and insurance companies. In the end, the most positive thing is that modern studies involving laboratory models and artificial intelligence are being carried out across the world, aimed in the direction that one day we will be able to predict earthquakes. This might even take us to the point where we will have to place thousands or millions of microsensors on every fault in the Earth's interior and then monitor the strain in real time. In a way, we will have a "crystal ball" — an insight into the dynamics and future behavior of faults. InSAR, LIDAR and GPS are just some of the networks and methods that give us an insight into where the Earth's crust is most stressed from surface deformations. The stress or tension build-up mechanism on a fault is still under investigation. —What are the signs that nature is telling us?' Scientists are triggering earthquakes in the Alps to find out what happens before one hits —Link between Cascadia and San Andreas Fault earthquakes discovered 30 years after lost vessel stumbled across key data Investments are also made in mathematical geophysics, as well as in machine learning and improved techniques for processing enormous amounts of digital data. Investments are also made in alarm systems based on the detection of P waves. Even a few seconds of warning before the arrival of S waves can be crucial to saving people and infrastructure. Likewise, investments are being made in modern construction resistant to earthquakes. But the conclusion is that, unless you want to move to stable parts of the continents, somewhere in Siberia, to the northernmost, permanently frozen parts of Canada, or the remote regions of the Australian Outback seldom struck by earthquakes, we need to learn to live with earthquakes.

When Worlds Quake: The Quest to Understand the Interior of Earth and Beyond (Kindle Edition)When Worlds Quake is a fascinating account of how scientists around the globe seek to use quakes to answer tantalizing questions about the structure and inner dynamics of our planet and to discover the deepest secrets of our nearest neighbors in the solar system.

We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. Morocco coach Walid Regragui has firmly rejected suggestions that officials at the Africa Cup of Nations have shown favouritism towards the host nation. Conspiracy theories alleging leniency from tournament referees have been circulating among some broadcast pundits and online supporters, but Regragui dismissed these claims outright. "It's always a shame to go down this path," he told a press conference on Tuesday as Morocco prepared to take on Nigeria in their semi-final in Rabat on Wednesday. "They want to make people believe that matches are always won this way. Let's not kid ourselves, it's always been the case on the African continent to sow doubts and controversies. "You journalists need to do your job," he added. Regragui said he believed referees at the tournament were seeking to do their best, but also gave example of incidents in matches where he felt the whistle did not favour Morocco. He cited two incidents from their impressive 2-0 win over Cameroon in their quarter-final on Friday to illustrate his argument. "One of their defenders puts his foot on Abde (Ezzalzouli)'s ankle, and if VAR reviews the play, it's a penalty," he said. "The goalkeeper comes out to challenge (Ismael) Saibari and puts both hands in his head, that's a penalty. Regragui said he had told his players to ignore any refereeing controversy. You've never heard me talk about the refereeing after a match," he said. Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Wikipedia Non-View was described as a "UFO film." If anyone knows how to do a UFO film, it's Steven Spielberg. Spielberg already had a great main cast lined up for the film including Emily Blunt, Colin Firth, Eve Hewson, Colman Domingo and Josh O'Connor. The casting call was looking for background actors local to the Hudson Valley that live near Catskill and Haines Falls. These actors would play "hotel guests, diner patrons and drivers with cars." As time went on we learned that the film was actually called Disclosure Day and the trailer was recently released. We scanned through IMDB to check out possible filming locations. But as we mentioned above a casting call was posted looking for extras in Haines Falls and filming was spotted in parts of Westchester. Take a look at the trailer below and let us know if you see any familiar sights: While we can't confirm which scenes were filmed locally, some of them have a Hudson Valley vibe. If you put together the casting call looking for diner patrons and the shooting dates, it looks like Selena's may be a shooting location. In early January 2026 Best Medicine aired on Fox starring Josh Charles. The newest Fox show filmed in Orange and Dutchess County for much of 2025.

This striking satellite photo shows rippling ribbons of ethereal ice swirling like turbulent clouds on the surface of Lake Michigan, alongside a snow-covered Chicago. During this time, temperatures in Chicago fell to as low as minus 33 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 36 degrees Celsius), according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This sudden drop in temperature, coupled with strong offshore winds, caused ice to form around the coastline and be pushed outward, creating the beautiful swirls. These flowing ribbons look a lot like clouds when viewed from above, but they are entirely ice, according to NASA's Earth Observatory. In total, around 20% of Lake Michigan was covered by ice when the satellite photo was taken, which is just above average for the time of year, according to NOAA's Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL). While lake ice is common in January, the extent of ice on Lake Michigan doesn't normally peak until February or March. It is also more common to see uniform sheets of ice rather than the flowing patterns visible in this image. In this case, the darker, wispy ice near the lakeshore likely accumulated into thicker offshore constructs with rough edges that appear more white when viewed from above, Jia Wang, an ice climatologist at GLERL, told the Earth Observatory. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Other Great Lakes were also impacted by the cold snap, including Lake Erie, which saw up to 80% of its surface frozen, according to GLERL. Erie's ice was so thick and emerged so quickly that a Canadian cargo freighter was trapped in place for three days, according to the New York Times. —Deep snow blanket transforms Yellowstone Lake into a giant white void This is not the first time that satellite photos have revealed something unusual about Lake Michigan. In 2024, aerial images helped researchers identify more than 40 mysterious craters scattered across the lake's bed, which currently have no definitive explanation. The low temperatures and strong winds around Chicago can also cause other unusual winter sights, such as bizarre chess piece-like sand sculptures along Lake Michigan's beaches, known as "hoodoos," which form when frozen chunks of sand are exposed to strong gusts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The six workers were stunned when they saw the airborne object near Fortescue Metals Group's Solomon mine site in the Pilbara region at about 5am on December 7. According to one witness, it stood out clearly against the morning sky. The driver initially thought the object was a cloud, but decided it looked more like a triangular UFO shape often seen in other sightings around the world. 'It can't be,' the shocked witness said. Another suggested it could be a medical evacuation helicopter, but others disagreed. 'It was in no way shaped like one,' they said, while admitting the distance made it hard to identify clearly with the naked eye. 'That is a genuine UFO, guys,' he told his workmates. No official explanation has been provided for the sighting. Last year, a bizarre object was found on fire in remote WA with no visible signs to indicate how it got there. Police coordinated a multi-agency response after the item was found in October near a mining site near the small town of Newman. The large black object was similar to other known space re-entry debris, WA Police said in a statement. It sparked intrigue similar to previous UFO sightings across the country. A month earlier, there were reports of strange lights in the sky near Point Moore in Geraldton, 420km north of Perth.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Half of Americans say that aliens According to recent research, they have definitely or probably already visited Earth. This data appears alongside a broader picture: most believe they exist, but the dominant sentiment about an encounter is not celebration, but rather risk. The survey was conducted online between November 4 and 9, 2025, with Adult 1.114 from United States. Earth's magnetic pole changes course, slowing down for the first time in decades and forcing an urgent update to the global model used by airplanes, ships, GPS and cell phones: the new version promises 10 times greater accuracy. The United States is experiencing an increase in toxic air pollution, and authorities are urging residents of three states to stay indoors. Cristiano Ronaldo's new luxury mansion, valued at £30 million in a prime area of ​​Portugal, took over three years to complete. Within this framework, 56% stated that aliens They definitely or probably exist. When the question moves on to visits to Earth, 47% say that aliens They definitely or probably visited the planet at some point, indicating that the belief is not restricted to abstract existence. Regarding UFOs, 30% believe that unidentified flying objects are likely alien spacecraft or life forms, while 45% say there is some other explanation. The contrast shows that, even among those who accept the possibility of aliensHowever, there is a high barrier to directly associating UFOs with alien origins. Democrats appear more likely than Republicans to assert that aliens There are those who attribute UFOs to alien origins, while independent theories remain in an intermediate position, reinforcing how the topic intersects with politics, institutional trust, and the interpretation of evidence. When surveyed about the effects of a visit, Americans are about twice as likely to say it would be negative than positive: 29% indicate a negative effect, compared to 14% who see a positive effect, and 25% who assess that it would be neither positive nor negative. For 55%, it is very or somewhat likely that aliens They would introduce new diseases capable of infecting humans. Furthermore, 43% think it's likely they would unintentionally injure or kill people, and 43% consider it likely they would come in peace, a tie that translates to... ambivalence More than certain. Most people believe that, if they exist, aliens They would be far more technologically advanced than humans, with 74% stating this. Also, 66% consider it likely that they would wish to remain hidden from humans, which supports the narrative of a discreet presence that is difficult to prove. Regarding communication, 50% believe it would be likely that aliens were able to communicate with humans. At the same time, only 29% think it's likely they would have a sense of humor, a detail that reinforces how the collective imagination tends to portray them as enigmatic and potentially dangerous, not as friendly visitors. Only 13% think the government would release this information. Among these, 28% believe it was more likely to originate from aliens, while 48% point to another explanation, maintaining the division even when there is a direct report. The most significant difference arises between those who already believe in visits: between those who say that aliens Of those who have already visited Earth, 31% believe contact will occur within 10 years and 53% within 50 years. Among those who don't believe in visits, only 2% expect contact within 10 years, showing how current beliefs shape the... In your opinion, this fear of aliens Does it stem more from the risk of disease, distrust in the government, or the cultural impact of admitting that we are not alone?

Cops in Washington state recently received a rather unusual report from a resident who could not find their cigarettes and suspected that something paranormal was behind the mysterious disappearance. According to a local media report, the Moses Lake Police Department got the odd call last Tuesday morning at around 7:30 AM. The unnamed resident informed the dispatcher that, in a matter of seconds, their hand-rolled cigarettes had just suddenly vanished. With no sign of an intruder or any other explanation for their disappearance, the caller pointed to "paranormal activity" as the cause of the curious incident.
