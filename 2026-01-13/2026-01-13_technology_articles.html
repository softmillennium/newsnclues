                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now, it appears the e-commerce giant is taking those efforts to a whole new scale. The company describes the plans as part of its culture of experimentation — calling it “a new concept that we think customers will be excited about.” Amazon says the store will offer fresh groceries, household essentials, and general merchandise, making it convenient for customers to shop a broad selection of items in one trip. “This could just be another experiment, but as experiments go, it reveals a degree of Walmart jealousy that we didn't expect,” wrote analysts Mike Levin and Josh Lowitz of Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP), in a report to subscribers this morning. CIRP notes that while Amazon dominates e-commerce, online shopping accounts for less than 20% of U.S. retail spending, leaving the vast majority of consumer dollars on the table. Amazon has tried a variety of physical retail formats over the years, with mixed results, in addition to its acquisition of Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in 2017. But with data showing that 93% of Amazon customers still shop at Walmart, CIRP suggests this new superstore concept is Amazon's admission that capturing the remaining addressable market requires building a physical moat that rivals the scale and utility of its biggest competitor. This is similar to an Amazon experiment at its Whole Foods locations — building a “store within a store” to bridge the gap between niche organic offerings and mass-market items. Amazon last fall unveiled an automated micro-fulfillment center attached to a Whole Foods in Plymouth Meeting, Pa. The concept allows shoppers to browse organic produce in the aisles while simultaneously ordering non-Whole Foods items — like Tide Pods, Pepsi, or Doritos — via an app. The Orland Park superstore appears to be an industrial-sized evolution of that experiment. “We like to explain it as: ‘It's the best that Amazon has to offer under Whole Foods, Fresh and their online offerings,' ” said Katie Jahnke Dale, a lawyer representing Amazon at the hearing. If approved, village officials estimate the store could open in late 2027.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>— Jon Pollock is now chief product officer of Acumatica, the Bellevue, Wash.-based enterprise software giant that was acquired last year by Vista Equity Partners. He previously held leadership roles with Worldpay, Asurion, Dell, Polaroid and others. “Jon has the experience, vision, and strong track record of leading dynamic teams to execute our product strategy and empower the people who use our software every day,” John Case, CEO of Acumatica, said in a statement. Case succeeds Ali Jani, who was with the company for 16 years. Malakoutian joined the Bellevue City Council in 2023, was elected by his colleagues to serve as deputy mayor beginning in 2024, and was chosen as mayor this month. — Software engineering leader David Bettis is leaving Amazon after two decades. Bettis was most recently with Amazon Web Services, including roles focused on the company's telehealth initiative. Earlier in his career, Bettis worked on the company's Halo product, Amazon Go's cashierless “Just Walk Out” technology, Kindle and other initiatives. Bettis said on LinkedIn that he stayed at Amazon for so long because of the opportunity to work on emerging businesses, which provided “new and exciting opportunities, while staying under the same roof.” More recently he had “explored a couple paths internally, but nothing sparked the same excitement I'd felt in previous roles. That's when I realized it was time for a bigger change.” The engineer added that he'll spend most of this year deciding what full-time role comes next — maybe a smaller company, teaching, something entrepreneurial — and that he'll be staying in Seattle. — In another Amazon departure, Steven Hatch has resigned from his role as head of engineering with AWS Bedrock. Hatch did not disclose his next move, but said there would be “more soon.” — Warren McNeel left T-Mobile after more then 25 years with the Bellevue-based telecom juggernaut. McNeel has been in the wireless sector for three decades, and most recently served as T-Mobile's senior vice president of information technology. McNeel said on LinkedIn that he wanted to spend time with his family “and begin thinking about the next chapter of my professional journey.” “I couldn't be more proud of the innovations, technology transformations, and results these teams delivered.” Fischer, who resides in Denver, is a business development and human resources consultant.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Instead, users are shown short excerpts pulled from traditional search results. According to The Guardian, the AI Overviews for those liver-related searches and others had “served up inaccurate health information and put people at risk of harm.” For example, the summaries reportedly provided for the liver test searchers included “masses of numbers, little context and no accounting for nationality, sex, ethnicity or age of patients.” The Guardian reported that some experts said these results could be dangerous. For instance, someone with liver disease might delay follow-up care if they rely on an AI-generated definition of what's normal. “We invest significantly in the quality of AI Overviews, particularly for topics like health, and the vast majority provide accurate information,” a Google spokesperson told Gizmodo in an emailed statement. “Our internal team of clinicians reviewed what's been shared with us and found that in many instances, the information was not inaccurate and was also supported by high quality websites. In cases where AI Overviews miss some context, we work to make broad improvements, and we also take action under our policies where appropriate.” The removals come at a moment when more people than ever are turning to AI for answers about their health, and the industry is taking notice. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, said last week that roughly a quarter of its 800 million regular users submit a healthcare-related prompt every week, with more than 40 million doing so daily. Days later, OpenAI launched ChatGPT Health, a health-focused experience that can connect with users' medical records, wellness apps, and wearable devices. And shortly after that, the company announced it had acquired the healthcare startup Torch, which tracks medical records including lab results, recordings from doctor visits, and medications. On Monday, the company announced a new set of AI tools that allow healthcare providers, insurers, and patients to use its Claude chatbot for medical purposes. As AI advances in healthcare, even minor errors or missing context can have significant consequences for patients. Whether these companies are ready for that remains to be seen. Thank god someone is brave enough to take down many people's favorite wireless earbuds. Not everyone liked hearing Disney got into bed with OpenAI, but SAG-AFTRA thinks it could be good for transparency and progress.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For every action during Saturday's Seattle Seahawks vs. San Francisco 49ers NFL playoff game, there will hopefully be an equal and positive reaction from fans at Lumen Field. Whether or not there's another dramatic tip to send the Niners packing, more than 68,000 fans in the stands will be captured in their seats by a multicamera system from Momento. The company also captures images during Seattle Mariners and Kraken games. There are 16 cameras positioned around Lumen Field, snapped by an operator during big plays when fans get to their feet and show excitement. For the Seahawks vs. Rams “Thursday Night Football” game on Dec. 18, fans could search a drop-down menu for several big plays such as “JSN in in!” and “O-M-G Shaheed!” The Seattle Times reported that Seahawks fans have downloaded 48,000 images so far this season, according to Momento founder and CEO Austin Fletcher. In a post on Facebook three years ago, Fletcher likened the technology to roller coaster ride photos, but for sports fans. Fans worried about privacy or how their likeness is being used give up some of those rights based on the NFL's and Lumen Field's terms of use agreement for ticket holders. The Times noted that Momento does honor opt-out requests for fans who don't want their images shown. In an appearance on FOX 13 Seattle a few weeks ago, Momento COO Todd Albright said website visitors looking for images are only allowed to enter a couple of seat locations rather than being able to search endlessly for faces in the crowd.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This physics-based model, called 1X World Model, uses a combination of video and prompts to give Neo robots new abilities. A 1X spokesperson declined to share a timeline of when these bots were shipping or share any information regarding how many have been ordered beyond saying preorders exceeded expectations. “After years of developing our world model and making Neo's design as close to human as possible, Neo can now learn from internet-scale video and apply that knowledge directly to the physical world,” Bernt Børnich, founder and CEO of 1X said in a statement. 1X isn't saying the world model allows today's Neo bots to do a new task right away from capturing video and being prompted, a company spokesperson clarified. Instead, the bot takes video data linked to specific prompts and then sends that back into the world model. That model is then fed back into the network of bots to give them a better understanding of the physical world and more know-how. It also gives users insight into how Neo is thinking of behaving or reacting to a certain prompt. Becca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

Framework, the DIY-focused PC manufacturer, has announced that it is raising prices on its desktop PC as a result of continuing RAM shortages rocking the consumer technology industry. "We held off on it as long as we could, but with LPDDR5x memory prices from our suppliers continuing to increase rapidly, we've had to update the pricing on Framework Desktop systems and Mainboards," Framework CEO Nirav Patel wrote in an updated blog post detailing the company's response to the memory crisis. The top configuration, with a Ryzen AI Max+ 395 processor featuring Radeon 8060S graphics and 128GB of RAM, used to start at $1,999, but now it is $2,459.Framework has been particularly transparent about its price increases — moreso than the big box OEMs. The company made its last increase specifically for RAM modules in December, and at the time suggested that more increases would likely be coming. This, however, is the first time that pricing has directly affected Framework's systems. Patel wrote in the blog update that Framework is only raising prices to cover increased costs from suppliers. And he doesn't seem to think things are getting better: "The memory outlook as we enter 2026 continues to get worse," he wrote. Dell, Asus, and other PC manufacturers have price increases on the way. We've also seen announcements of hikes from single-board computer leader Raspberry Pi. This move is a sign that 2026 will continue to be a rocky market for companies selling PCs and for people who want to build them alike.

Framework, the DIY-focused PC manufacturer, has announced that it is raising prices on its desktop PC as a result of continuing RAM shortages rocking the consumer technology industry. "We held off on it as long as we could, but with LPDDR5x memory prices from our suppliers continuing to increase rapidly, we've had to update the pricing on Framework Desktop systems and Mainboards," Framework CEO Nirav Patel wrote in an updated blog post detailing the company's response to the memory crisis. The top configuration, with a Ryzen AI Max+ 395 processor featuring Radeon 8060S graphics and 128GB of RAM, used to start at $1,999, but now it is $2,459.Framework has been particularly transparent about its price increases — moreso than the big box OEMs. The company made its last increase specifically for RAM modules in December, and at the time suggested that more increases would likely be coming. This, however, is the first time that pricing has directly affected Framework's systems. Patel wrote in the blog update that Framework is only raising prices to cover increased costs from suppliers. And he doesn't seem to think things are getting better: "The memory outlook as we enter 2026 continues to get worse," he wrote. Dell, Asus, and other PC manufacturers have price increases on the way. We've also seen announcements of hikes from single-board computer leader Raspberry Pi. This move is a sign that 2026 will continue to be a rocky market for companies selling PCs and for people who want to build them alike.

People get attached to specific OF stars and the medium inherently requires remote work. So it's an inherently global labour force that protectionism won't help. American OF models won't magically make more money if you ban immigration unless you also ban cultural imports.The government isn't displacing local talent by importing OF models and gets tax dollars for essentially doing nothing. Those tax dollars pay for schools/hospitals/etc.OF also skews towards young, unmarried women, which balances the gender surplus of unmarried men that generally tries to immigrate. Since they're young, they also have more productivity before drawing on benefits like Medicare or Social Security.By any objective standard OF models are the ideal migrant.

But at the same time, the immigration system historically penalized anyone who engages in prostitution and actively denied entry to people found to be engaged in it.

I hate to be that person, but the fact that so many people on HN think OF is prostitution is revealing of the site's demographics (i.e. older).

"My default strategy was this: I would invite the man in, we'd sit down and talk for a while. I'd establish physical contact in the conversation by touching his hand when laughing at a joke, or crossing my leg so it bumped into his. I would become increasingly charmed, utterly fascinated by his life, and I asked him to explain to me concepts I already knew (remember, they like you smart in order to validate their identity as a man who likes smart women, and they still love teaching you things). Well it's not non-existent either, there are a fair number of onlyfans models (and also general actors in the field of pornography who do the same) who do escorting on the side.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than two dozen Immigration and Customs Enforcement vehicles on the ground in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area “currently lack the necessary emergency lights and sirens” required to be “compliant with law enforcement requirements,” according to a contract justification published in a federal register on Tuesday. “These vehicles were deployed prior to being permanently retrofitted and currently lack the necessary emergency lights and sirens required for operational use,” the document says. HSI's most recent public handbook for agents conducting “emergency driving”—defined as driving during “official duties,” like low- or high-risk pursuits, that may require breaking speed limits or violating certain traffic laws—appears to have been published in 2012. The handbook adds that if an HSI officer is emergency driving but their vehicle does not have lights or sirens, they “must terminate” their participation in a law enforcement operation, and an officer from another law enforcement agency that does have lights and sirens should take over. This HSI officer ”may continue to assist in a backup role, if necessary.” The handbook does not specify the exact number or location of lights that have to be on an emergency vehicle, but it says that officers are responsible for reviewing any state statutes for emergency lights and sirens where they operate. Minnesota state law requires law enforcement and emergency drivers to “sound an audible signal by siren” and have at least one red light on the front of the vehicle, among other stipulations. ICE did not immediately respond to WIRED's request for comment. According to Whelen's website, the ATLAS kit includes several items that are also sold separately by the company, including lightheads and lightbars, as well as a siren amplifier and speaker. The listing comes six days after ICE officer Jonathan Ross fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in her car in Minneapolis, sparking massive protests and an influx of right-wing influencers trying to capitalize on the chaos. In sworn testimony that Ross gave in federal court last December, in connection to an incident in which he was injured while attempting to arrest an individual named Roberto Carlos Muñoz-Guatemala for possible deportation, he made several mentions of his unmarked vehicle, which he used to trail Muñoz-Guatemala prior to the incident.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you've ever looked at a pair of AirPods and thought, “I really wish these were behind my ears and not in them,” then Jony Ive and Sam Altman might be here to save the day. Reports from a supply chain leaker, Smart Pikachu, who has previously shared information on rumored unreleased Apple products, indicate that an anticipated AI gadget from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and former Apple head of design, Jony Ive, has AirPods in its crosshairs. Hearing fresh detail on Openai "To-go" hardware project from last report. On manufacturing, Foxconn has been told to prepare for total 5 devices by Q4 2028. From there, I assume they can do stuff like play audio or place calls. If there was one thing I'd bet all the AirPods in the world on, it's that Sweetpea centers on an AI voice assistant powered by ChatGPT. Using microphones and a voice assistant, these not-earbuds could make calls, play audio, or maybe even control stuff on your phone. If that sounds a lot like what you can already do with wireless earbuds as they exist right now, well… that's because it is. “[the] main processor target is 2nm smart phone style chip (exynos most favored). Good idea or not, Smart Pikachu says that Sweetpea could be the first AI gadget we see from Altman and Ive's collaboration, with a projected release around September. After Sweetpea, we could see even wackier hardware that may include a “home-style device,” as the leaker puts it, or—and I'm not making this up—a pen? I guess, of the products potentially in the pipeline for Altman and Ive, Sweetpea sounds the most useful, but if I'm being honest, these little earpieces are going to have to do more than just dupe AirPods' best features to make an impact. The fact of the matter is that people like wireless earbuds—not only is the form factor familiar, proven, and cheap to make, but they also allow for stuff like active noise cancellation (ANC), which is a must-have if you live in a crowded city like me or if you ever fly on an airplane. Clearly, there's something in Sweetpea that we're not seeing yet, though. Whether anyone wants that type of hardware is another question entirely. Just like wireless earbuds, people also like their phones, and if you want to see how the whole unseating the phone with AI train is chugging along, I'd point you to the heaping wreck that is Humane and its failed Ai Pin. Either way, it looks like we'll have more premium AI gadgets to ogle soon enough—that is, if the tandem ever manages to get its computers—ya know—computing. 2026 is the year AI companies want to handle your health.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Monday, former New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who just left office following the election of Zohran Mamdani, promoted the launch of a new NYC Token memecoin on the Solana blockchain via a press conference, social media, and interviews. “We know cities can run better, and by using this New York City Token, we're going to continue to invest in making our city a safer city,” said Adams during his press event. Adams added that funds raised through the token offering would be used to build a non-profit organization, where the former mayor would initially refrain from taking a salary. According to blockchain observers, the NYC Token launch was successful in terms of generating funds, as movements of cryptocurrency on the Solana network indicate that at least $2.5 million worth of the token was liquidated into Circle's USDC stablecoin by entities involved with the original launch. This followed a common pump-and-dump pattern seen in many of the meme coins launched on Solana over the past couple of years, which occurred less than an hour after the coin went live. As a result of the price action and blockchain activity following the NYC Token launch, Adams has been accused of operating a pump-and-dump scam, which is extremely common with these sorts of crypto coins and is often referred to as a rug pull. This all happened in a little over an hour. In a statement posted on X, the NYC Token team wrote: Adams notably embraced Bitcoin and crypto during his mayoral campaign, and quickly became referred to as the “Bitcoin Mayor” after his election win. In fact, NYC Token is not the first cryptocurrency Adams has been involved with, as he helped launch New York City Coin during his time in office. This was a separate token that was released on top of the Stacks blockchain and was supposedly going to be used to fund various government services via investments made in the NYC-focused coin. He launched a $NYC memecoin just 30 minutes ago, and has removed its liquidity after promoting it on his personal social media, claiming to be the NYC token https://t.co/4s20jOTKEN pic.twitter.com/pFAG7l0XMq A large number of entertainers, politicians, and other celebrities have been caught up in various memecoin schemes over the past couple of years, with everyone from Argentine President Javier Milei to the “Hawk Tuah” girl getting involved. Of course, U.S. President Trump also launched his own memecoin around the time of his inauguration, which is just one of his many dubious and allegedly corrupt activities in the crypto space. Celebrities' social media accounts have also been hacked to promote these types of coins. Of course, some have questioned whether some of these “hacks” were simply a way for celebrities to promote outright scams without much blowback. While bitcoin and stablecoins have clearly found product-market fit, the vast majority of alternative crypto tokens that promised various alternative technical innovations are still mostly seen as dubious. In other words, it's a casino, albeit one that is likely even more rigged than traditional markets or gambling venues.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft said on Tuesday that it would be taking a series of steps toward becoming a “good neighbor” in communities where it is building data centers—including promising to ask public utilities to set higher electricity rates for data centers. Speaking onstage at an event in Great Falls, Virginia, Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith directly referenced a growing national pushback to data centers, describing it as creating “a moment in time when we need to listen, and we need to address these concerns head-on.” “When I visit communities around the country, people have questions—pointed questions. They even have concerns,” Smith said, as a slide showed headlines from various news outlets about opposition to data centers. “They are the type of questions that we need to heed … We are at a moment of time when people have a lot on their mind. They wonder what this big data center will mean to their water supply. The announcement follows a post from President Donald Trump on Truth Social on Monday in which he pledged that his administration would work with “major American Technology Companies,” including Microsoft, to make sure that data centers don't inflate customer utility bills. “Data Centers are key to that boom, and keeping Americans FREE and SECURE but, the big Technology Companies who build them must ‘pay their own way. These price hikes are due to a variety of factors, including the costs of repairing and maintaining the country's aging electric grid. As technology companies and utilities are predicting a massive new need for energy from the nationwide data center build-out, the Energy Information Administration projects that electric bills will keep increasing through 2026. Concerns around data centers and electricity bills played a key role in several local and state midterm elections last year, while research released last fall shows that local opposition to data centers skyrocketed in the second quarter of 2025, leading to billions of dollars in projects stalled or canceled. The political divide against data centers appears to be bipartisan. In recent months, influential former Trump strategist Steve Bannon has begun speaking against the energy and water costs of data centers on his War Room podcast, part of a larger pushback from some MAGA figureheads against the AI build-out in the US. It removed a variety of environmental protections for data centers, including water protections, expedited the review of chemicals involved in their use, and encouraged their development on federal land. Microsoft, which has around 100 data centers planned or under construction across the country, has met with some local pushback to some of its projects. In October, the company canceled plans for a data center in Wisconsin due to local opposition; the group leading the charge against that project warned of a potential “5 to 15 percent rate hike to subsidize cheap power.” The company revealed last week that it was also behind a proposed project in Michigan, which was put on hold in December following concerns from community members. Hundreds of residents attended a planning commission meeting for the project Monday night, with many telling local media they were there to express opposition. In December, White House AI czar David Sacks shared a tweet from Andy Masley, the head of an effective altruist organization in Washington, DC, whose Substack posts casting doubt on the environmental impacts of AI have gained popularity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple is launching a new Creator Studio subscription bundle that offers access to six creative apps as well as premium content in iWork apps, the company announced on Tuesday. It also includes premium content for Keynote, Pages, and Numbers. Later, the bundle will include Freeform for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. As part of Tuesday's announcement, Apple revealed that these creative apps are launching new features. Final Cut Pro on Mac and iPad is getting Transcript Search to find soundbites, Visual Search to find exact moments by describing them, and Beat Detection. There are also new features coming to Logic Pro, such as Synth Player, Chord ID, a new sound library, natural language search, and more. Apple Creator Studio also brings access to MainStage, which turns Macs into an instrument, voice processor, or guitar rig. Pixelmator Pro, a company Apple bought in 2024, is also coming to iPad for the first time, bringing its editing tools to more creators. It includes full Apple Pencil support alongside fast image editing. It also includes Compressor, which works with Final Cut Pro and Motion to customize output settings for distribution. “Apple Creator Studio is a great value that enables creators of all types to pursue their craft and grow their skills by providing easy access to the most powerful and intuitive tools for video editing, music making, creative imaging, and visual productivity — all leveled up with advanced intelligent tools to augment and accelerate workflows,” said Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Internet Software and Services, in a press release. In Pages, Numbers, and Keynote, a Creator Studio subscription unlocks a new “Content Hub” where users can find high-quality photos, graphics, and illustrations. Apple Creator Studio gives users access to beta features in Keynote, including tools to generate presentation drafts from text outlines, create presenter notes from existing slides, and quickly clean up layouts and object placement. The tech giant notes that Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Motion, Compressor, and MainStage will continue to be available as one-time purchases on the Mac App Store, while free versions of Numbers, Pages, Keynote, and Freeform will remain available.

Nvidia has refuted the rumor that it would require full advanced payment for H200 orders from its Chinese customers. The AI chip maker stated that it will not ask its clients to completely pay for an item that it has yet to receive. “We do not require upfront payment and would never require customers to pay for products that they do not receive,” an Nvidia spokesperson said in an email to Tom's Hardware. According to that report, one source claimed that Nvidia had previously required advanced payments from Chinese clients, sometimes only a deposit instead of a full upfront payment. The article claims that because it's unclear whether Beijing will allow its tech companies to purchase Nvidia H200 GPUs, the company has been "particularly strict" in enforcing these conditions to reduce financial risk. Even though China-based tech giants like Alibaba and ByteDance are reportedly ready to order over 200,000 of these chips each, the H200 is a last-generation chip that has since been superseded by the Blackwell family. Aside from that, Nvidia has already announced the succeeding Vera Rubin architecture, which is miles ahead in performance and efficiency over the previous-generation GPUs. As such, companies that have no restrictions will likely only want to purchase the latest available technology as they spend billions of dollars on AI infrastructure to gain an advantage over their competitors. Furthermore, those chips would have taken up the production capacity of Nvidia's contracted fabs, which it could have instead used for building GB200 or even newer chips that will sell for a much higher margin. The AI chip maker is likely able to easily do this because it reportedly still has over 80,000 H200 chips available in existing stock, reducing its exposure to vacillating political decisions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As a result, model providers have seen increased business, along with investor interest. On the back of this demand, today, Deepgram said that it has raised $130 million in a Series C round led by AVP at a $1.3 billion valuation. The round also saw existing investors such as Alkeon, In-Q-Tel, Madrona, Tiger, Wing, and Y Combinator put in more money. Plus, new investors like Alumni Ventures, Columbia University, Princeville Capital, Twilio, and SAP joined the round. The company has raised over $215 million in funding to date. Elizabeth de Saint-Aignan, a partner at AVP, told TechCrunch that when the fund was talking to enterprises about how they were using AI, voice came up frequently, and it started looking into companies working in this area. When we chatted with them more, we realized a lot of voice AI tech was powered by Deepgram, and that's what led us to them [Deepgram],” de Saint-Aignan said. She noted that voice AI could help in making customers' interactions with enterprises more pleasant while reducing costs for companies, and Deepgram could play a central part in it. It noted that more than 1,300 organizations use its voice AI products and models, including meeting notetaker Granola, voice agent startup Vapi, and Twilio. “In the last year, voice AI has gone mainstream, and there is more potential pull. And that is why we felt it could be a good time to raise,” he said. It is also focusing on catering to restaurants through voice AI. To that end, it has acquired Y Combinator-backed OfOne, which built a voice AI-powered solution for quick-service restaurants. The startup claims that it has more than 93% accuracy in receiving orders. Voice AI has had its challenges in the restaurant space. Last year, Taco Bell withdrew its voice AI experiment after a person ordered 18,000 water cups. “I am excited about this [voice AI-driven food ordering] because food ordering might be the first positive interaction more than 300 million Americans have with voice AI. But when you can order your food using natural conversation, people would think the technology is ready,” Stephenson said. There seems to be investor interest in the sector, as OfOne's acquisition news comes after Presto, which serves brands like Carl's Jr., picked up $10 million in new funding. With this growth rate, model and API providers will look to be multibillion-dollar companies by becoming a core component for enterprises and startups developing voice solutions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Hi-Fi industry seems to be in a state of constant, somewhat unnecessary evolution; if Guglielmo Marconi was inventing the radio today it would almost certainly come in five different colorways, dripped out over a few years as though they were new products. But what about the millions of old analogue amplifiers and passive speakers that still sound great? The Bowers & Wilkins bookshelf speakers you bought 20 years ago remain phenomenal, they're just not as smart. New Swedish startup Atonemo would like to change that with their small, unassuming Streamplayer. Measuring a matchbox-sized 1.97 x 2.76 x 0.73 inches, the Streamplayer is a very simple device designed to give streaming capabilities to any existing speaker. It supports AirPlay 2, has Chromecast built-in, Spotify Connect and Tidal Connect, and can offer playback in a respectable 24-bit/192 kHz high resolution. There's no display, a single clicky button, and output options are via one 3.5mm jack either as analog or optical S/PDIF. Power comes via USB-C, and once you've synched everything up with the Atonemo app, linked it to your Wi-Fi, and plugged the supplied 3.5mm jack into an amplifier or active speaker, you can then stream audio to it from pretty much any platform. It took me three minutes to turn a verging-on-vintage Vita Audio R1 Mk1 (what is now Ruark Audio) into a Tidal streaming delight. The app is mercifully stripped back, and the software feels nimble, and is a whole lot more responsive than using Sonos. Despite having access to more hi-fi kit than is strictly healthy, I still struggle with the quality vs. convenience of it all: There's a $45 Echo Spot in my kitchen, but I have a $1,400 Audiolab M-DAC+ headphone amp in the office. The Streamplayer does its best to straddle both these worlds. The team at Atonemo has chosen an integrated DAC from Realtek's SoC (system-on-chip) range. This chip is a mass-market option, but can still handle 24-bit / 192 kHz resolution. It's a world away from high-end standalone DAC chips (like ESS, Cirrus Logic or AKM) but at $99, to expect audiophile levels of DSP (digital signal processing) would be a bit much. Plugged into my father's 20-year-old Arcam amplifier, powering a pair of equally vintage Mordaunt Short floorstanding speakers, the Streamplayer works smoothly. It did require a 3.5mm to RCA cable (more in this below) but dad's box of old cables is a tech treasure trove. On first listen I was impressed by the ease of it all, and switching between Qobuz and Spotify Lossless certainly didn't offend. Rick Danko's bass lines soared and the layering of the instruments was wonderfully pronounced via CD, while they were noticeably subdued when streaming. Atonemo makes a big deal over being able to power “all” legacy speakers. Included in the box is a single 3.5mm to 3.5mm audio jack, giving the ability to plug into active speakers, old radios, cassette players, boomboxes, and anything with a 3.5mm aux-in port. I think including a couple of cable options would have been a good idea, especially at launch, just to avoid any friction points with first-time installation, as not everyone has a box of old cables as comprehensive as my Dad. Atonemo isn't the only option when it comes to breathing new life into older hi-fi components. The WiiM Mini Music Streamer ($89) is cheaper, offers AirPlay/Chromecast/Spotify Connect streaming capabilities and a XX DAC. And for a further boost in audio quality plus one of the finest hi-res streaming multiroom platforms, the $379 Bluesound Node nano streamer is hard to ignore. There are also plenty of basic Bluetooth dongles available too if audio quality, or the ability to enjoy multi-room audio, isn't important to you. But what Atonemo has done well is remove any technical barriers to use. The app is incredibly simple—in a good way—with no bloat, or pretence it is doing anything other than facilitating streaming between your old speakers and a modern streaming platform. Yes, it could (and probably should) squeeze in a better DAC, and a more comprehensive collection of cables, but these are deliberate omissions, not glaring mistakes.
