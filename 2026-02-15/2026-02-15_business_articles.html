                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They determine whether we move closer to our goals, or repeat the same mistakes. As a psychologist who studies couples — and as a husband — I've seen how some of the most powerful relationship rituals also happen to be the simplest. Here are five habits that reliably show up in the happiest, most resilient relationships. Humans are biologically wired to focus on the negative. This bias helped our ancestors survive by scanning for threats. But in modern relationships, it often leads to pessimism, criticism or chronic dissatisfaction. Over time, a glass-half-empty mindset trains partners to look for problems rather than moments worth appreciating. That's why what researchers call "capitalization," or how partners respond when the other shares good news, is so important. Studies show that when people respond with enthusiasm (i.e., asking questions, expressing interest, celebrating wins), couples report higher relationship satisfaction and stronger emotional bonds. Feeling like your partner is "your person" matters a lot, but no one can realistically meet all of another person's emotional, social and psychological needs. It prevents the relationship from becoming overburdened by unrealistic expectations. The relationship becomes a place of choice, not obligation. Variety is called the spice of life for a reason. Even strong relationships can begin to feel stale when the novelty disappears. This is especially true for couples who live together and work demanding jobs; the cycle of work, home, sleep and repeat can become monotonous over time. This is why happy couples actively seek out what researchers call “third spaces," or environments that exist outside of home (the first place) and work (the second place). When you regularly introduce new third spaces into your routine, you inject a sense of novelty and adventure without needing to travel or make any major life changes. Consistency and support are foundational in healthy relationships. But over time, some couples begin to over-rely on one another — for emotional regulation, decision-making or daily logistics. They maintain solo hobbies, spend time alone, or handle some responsibilities individually. This independence is vital for maintaining a sense of self. People grow and change in little ways more often than we realize. By making time to ask questions, they also begin to notice all the new dreams, wants and needs in their partner. This protects them from one of the most common relationship pitfalls: distance despite proximity. Mark Travers, PhD, is a psychologist who specializes in relationships.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Employers don't appear eager to mix their 401(k) plans with emergency savings options for workers, new research suggests. Although companies have been permitted since 2024 to allow $1,000 emergency withdrawals from retirement savings and to offer 401(k)-linked emergency savings accounts, there's been little adoption, according to a Vanguard report released this week. Just 4% allow the $1,000 emergency 401(k) withdrawals, according to Vanguard's analysis of 1,300 plans. Those two in-plan options were authorized under the 2022 retirement legislation known as Secure Act 2.0, amid growing concern about Americans' lack of emergency savings. Although the vast majority of employers are not providing the 401(k)-linked accounts — technically called pension-linked emergency savings accounts — some companies are offering external emergency savings accounts, said Craig Copeland, director of wealth benefits research for the Employee Benefit Research Institute. Building and maintaining emergency savings can be tricky for many households, especially those that are struggling to keep up with the high cost of living. Although inflation has eased to a yearly rate of 2.4% since peaking at 9.1% in June 2022, prices overall have climbed more than 25% since 2020, based on the consumer price index. Financial advisors generally recommend having three to six months' worth of living expenses set aside as emergency savings. Yet just 47% of respondents in a December survey said they have the funds to cover a $1,000 emergency expense, according to Bankrate's yearly Emergency Savings Report, released last week. Last year, employer worries about their workers' financial well-being reached a new high: 48% rated their concern at 9 or 10 on a scale of 1 to 10, up from 43% in 2024 and 39% in 2023, according to December research from EBRI. That is, they are established and maintained within the 401(k) plan itself. For 2026, that amount is $24,500, with investors age 50 and older allowed an additional $8,000. As for the $1,000 emergency 401(k) withdrawal: Most employers — 94% as of 2024, according to Vanguard — already allow their workers to access their retirement savings if they are facing financial hardship. "In many cases, it would add something that's already being provided," Copeland said. While employers have largely eschewed the Secure 2.0 emergency savings provisions, that could change over time. "If a plan sponsor wants to move forward with an emergency savings program at their company, they're going to analyze the options available, and part of that [analysis] will be what's easiest to implement," said Will Hansen, executive director of the Plan Sponsor Council of America. "A $1,000 withdrawal is easier than a [401(k)-linked account] and an account not affiliated with the plan could be an easier feature as well," Hansen said. Among other administrative complexities, one of the sticking points with 401(k)-linked accounts is that highly compensated employees — under one IRS test, those earning $160,000 or more — are not permitted to participate. That's an administrative challenge because workers' incomes can fluctuate, which makes it tricky for a 401(k) plan's recordkeeper to monitor, said Brandie Barrows, a partner with Hall Benefits Law in San Francisco. A bipartisan bill introduced in December in both the House and Senate would expand eligibility to use the accounts. "It wouldn't hurt to take that exclusion off and increase the amount that people can save," Barrows said. In the meantime, experts say, employers will likely continue to partner with external firms that offer emergency savings accounts. Recent research from EBRI shows that 51% of firms with 500 or more employees offer some sort of emergency fund. That includes external savings accounts, but is not broken out in the data. "It's less complicated" than setting up an account within the 401(k) plan, he said. "Outside the plan, it's much easier to get your money immediately, whereas getting it out of the plan could take two to three days at a minimum," he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To learn more about the CNBC CFO Council, visit cnbccouncils.com/cfo At many a Holiday Inn or Hampton Inn, the lobby at 8 a.m. is a pinwheel of pajama-clad kids, frazzled parents, and solo business travelers jockeying for position in front of the waffle maker. At hotels, which have been ditching items like free soaps and even bathroom doors to economize, the free breakfast is a sacred cow that some worry will not survive, increasingly seen by hotel operators as an money pit eating into the thin margins of the business. "That goes far beyond breakfasts, to things like housekeeping — less often during a stay, less extensive when it's done during a stay — to bulk toiletries rather than individual mini-bottles to eliminating products like alarm clocks in rooms," Leff said. I would argue that once free breakfast makes the shift from being a 'surprise and delight' endearing moment to an expectation, then its days are numbered," Crimmins said. "Looking for proof of this slow demise in your average Holiday Inn Express breakfast area? Look no further than the recent explosion of 'Grab and Go' options. Leff says that catering to a more affluent customer, as in the case of Hyatt Hotels, may offer operators more latitude to eliminate breakfast. A Hyatt spokesperson said while the company has "tested breakfast options at select Hyatt Place hotels that offer guests the ability to book rates that do not include breakfast ... Leff says Hyatt has not released data on the trial, and many guests probably just assume breakfast will be free when they book at this point. "Unclear yet whether Hyatt can get away with not doing limited-service breakfast," he said. Marriott International CEO Anthony Capuano describes the hotel business right now as being emblematic of the K-shaped economy receiving so much attention. "There are economic headwinds and some uncertainty but we continue to see the consumer prioritizing travel and experiences," Capuano told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" last week after its most recent earnings. "Luxury was a real highlight for us," Capuano said, adding that 10 percent of Marriott's portfolio is in the luxury tier. Marriott has made breakfast changes in some overseas luxury locations. For instance, the Regis Macao eliminated free breakfast for Platinum, Titanium, and Ambassador loyalty members as of March 2025 and replaced it with bonus points or discounted breakfast instead. Some Reddit users have posted this month about free omelettes disappearing from Marriott breakfast bars and now being part of the paid full breakfast buffet, but a Marriott spokesman said that is not a company-wide policy and, if true, would be individual hotel operators making that decision. The consumer split is leading to a bifurcation of breakfast models, with higher-end customers going towards paid eggs benedict and homemade croissants while middle- and lower-income consumers crowd the free buffet. To be sure, Americans like their hotel breakfast. Andrea Stokes, hospitality practice lead at JD Power, said that data suggests guests continue to rate breakfast as an important part of their hotel stay. "This proportion is even higher at limited-service upper midscale and midscale hotel brands where complimentary breakfast is typically part of the hotel brand's standard offering," Stokes said. When JD Power asks upper midscale and midscale hotel guests to rate the importance of hotel features or amenities, about half (47%) rate complimentary breakfast as "need-to-have" (versus only nice-to-have). Mitchell Murray, CEO of Station House Inn and three other boutique hotels in Lake Tahoe, California, says while large chain hotels can offer economies of scale, free breakfast can account for roughly 5% of total revenue, closer to 6–7% once labor is included. "That's a meaningful cost, and many operators are asking, 'Does free breakfast actually generate 5% more revenue or bookings?' In many cases, the answer is no," Murray said. He added that when breakfast is free, quality often suffers — think mediocre coffee, watery eggs, frozen potatoes. "It's edible, but rarely memorable or value-adding," Murray said. One of Murray's properties is a Holiday Inn Express which he is transitioning to an independent hotel this year and where he plans to do away with the free breakfast after the change, once freed from corporate mandates. Major hotel brand franchisors have specific brand standards that franchisees must adhere to, and this includes food and beverage standards. Best Western, though, has no plans to unplug the waffle iron. "Offering a complimentary breakfast is an important part of our guest experience across much of our portfolio," said the hotel chain's CEO Larry Cuculic. Cuculic says the economics still make sense: breakfast supports guest satisfaction and repeat business, by leveraging the purchasing power of its extensive hotel network, Best Western can help hotels manage costs while maintaining quality and consistency, "making breakfast both a friendly touchpoint for guests and a driver of long-term loyalty," he said. Holiday Inn Express is also standing by the free breakfast bar. "Breakfast plays a critical role in our value proposition and continues to be a major reason why travelers choose to stay with us – it's something they know, trust, and expect from our brand, "said Justin Alexander, vice president, global brand management for Holiday Inn Express, Staybridge Suites & Candlewood Suites. Hotel breakfast factors into the travel planning of Aimee Misovich and her family. The Holland, Michigan, resident said that her family are Hilton Honors members. "So we always stay at their properties — typically, Embassy Suites, Homewood or Hampton Inn. All three still offer free hotel breakfasts," Misovich said, adding that she likes the variety offered. The food and beverage offering, even if only for breakfast service, can be a key differentiator for limited-service hotel brands. "Any hotels that consider scaling back or eliminating free breakfast must focus on demonstrating value in other ways," Stokes said. Rita Chaddad, a faculty member who teaches courses on tourism and hospitality management at Columbia Southern University, predicts that free breakfast will continue to be eliminated in the luxury brands but remain in some form elsewhere, though travelers should expect more changes to come. "Breakfast is likely to remain, but the model may become more segmented," Chaddad said. In upper-midscale settings, hotels may be more willing to offer breakfast through credits, optional add-ons, or targeted inclusion — for example, through packages or loyalty benefits. "In these tiers, hotels may have more flexibility to replace 'free' with perceived value in other forms, provided it is communicated well and the guest feels the trade-off is fair," Chaddad said. "Removing it can create a perceived loss that may outweigh operational savings, even if the hotel's overall cost structure improves behind the scenes. For value-oriented travelers, breakfast is often interpreted as part of the 'deal,' and losing it can complicate the guest's mental math when comparing properties," Chaddad said. Chaddad said hotels will increasingly play with the offering, and beyond higher-tier hotels, travelers should be on the lookout for new models showing up as room-only versus breakfast-included choices, breakfast offered through packages or loyalty benefits, or other redesigned formats that control costs while keeping the benefit visible to guests. While some of those changes may add to the hotel bottom line, they could come with an added emotional cost. "My kids and I would be really sad if they discontinue free hotel breakfasts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many European policymakers appear to still be smarting from U.S. Vice President JD Vance's tough words about the region at last year's Munich Security Conference. So, it's perhaps not too surprising that U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's comments on Saturday at this year's event underscoring the U.S. and Europe's common heritage, goals and challenges have come as something of a relief in European capitals. "[Rubio] delivered a speech which still assured us that we stand together in this partnership between Europe and the United States," German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul told CNBC in an interview on the sidelines of the conference. On Saturday, Rubio said the U.S. has no intention of abandoning its deep alliance with Europe and wants the region to succeed. "We want Europe to be strong," he told the gathering of defense and security officials in the German city. "We believe that Europe must survive, because the two great wars of the last century serve, for us, as history's great reminder, that ultimately, our destiny is, and will always be, intertwined with yours." He lambasted his audience about the health of their democracies, their migration policies and freedom of speech. While Rubio's tone might have been more conciliatory than Vance's, the underlying issues remained the same, as some conference attendees acknowledged. "Of course, there were some issues he raised. We would answer differently when it comes to the migration problem, when it comes, of course, to question how we organize our legal framework here in Europe with regard to the digital services. U.S. President Donald Trump has frequently criticized Europe for its open migration policies, for being too reliant on the U.S. for its security and has pushed NATO allies to boost defense spending. It is also clear that we don't see eye-to-eye in all the issues and that this will remain the case. But I think we can work from there." A recurring theme at this year's event has been an earnest investigation into how Europe can stand on its own two feet, militarily and economically, in the face of challenges from Russia and China while the U.S. seeks to rework the global post-war order it created. While European leaders acknowledge they must become less dependent on the U.S.'s security umbrella and markets, some bristle at the Trump administration's more confrontational approach compared to its predecessors. "I think there were messages for us, and there were messages for the public in America, especially their constituents," Kallas said. "For me, every time I hear this European bashing, it's very in fashion right now, I'm thinking of what is the alternative?" Others were even more critical of Rubio's comments. And I think the worst lesson we could draw from this weekend is to say 'I can cling to some love words I heard in part of his speech and push the snooze button.'" Focus on our rearmaments, on the support for Ukraine, and the threat that Russia poses to all of our democracies. Wadephul told CNBC that work to become more independent is underway. "But this is what we are doing on our own, and Europe has also learned that, of course, if you ask for more European sovereignty, you will receive it," he said. "And that also means that, of course, we are more independent than we were in the past. And of course, we are looking for new global partners in the world which are willing to work together with Europe, for instance, Japan, India, Brazil and so on. So this is, I would say, if you are looking to a new global order, this means we keep our alliances, but additionally, we have new global partners, and this is a good future for Europe."

Agents wrote all of the code the company uses — something that wouldn't have been possible before last year, he told Business Insider. The company's six-person team produced what Gadhia calls "unprecedented" amounts of code in its first 12 months. Five years ago, he said, reaching the same level of productivity would have required 20 to 30 engineers. Across tech, AI agents powered by large language models are absorbing tasks that experienced engineers once handled. Software engineering is becoming a human-AI partnership — what Anthropic chief Dario Amodei has called the industry's "centaur phase." And, as some tech insiders increasingly warn, what begins in software rarely stays there, with potential implications for other white-collar fields. By morning, the work is ready, Brendan Humphreys, Canva's chief technology officer, said. "Often, those results are really impressive," he told Business Insider. Engineers still apply a "human touch" to reach the company's quality bar. Humphreys said that his senior engineers now often describe their jobs as "largely review" — checking AI output, steering one or more agents to follow a plan, and taking responsibility for the final product. AI can help, but doing it well requires "precision of articulation" in what's required, Humphreys said. It also demands "mastery of the domain" so engineers can quickly verify that what AI produces is correct — and prevent unnecessary complexity from creeping into Canva's roughly 70 million lines of code, he said. At Cora, Gadhia compares AI to a typewriter: It generates the code, freeing engineers to focus on "higher-level strategic architecture," meeting customers, and brainstorming features. Cora builds agents that help software companies manage customer relationships. The agents take on tasks like gathering customer requirements, drafting presentations, and following up with clients, he said. The AI will "run around, do all this work, and you can supervise them," said Gadhia, who is also the San Francisco company's chief technology officer. Gadhia said Cora's CEO, who doesn't have a technical background, recently asked an agent to change the font on the company's website during a redesign. As agents handle more tasks — something that appeals to some, but rankles others — debate inside tech over AI has intensified. Microsoft's AI chief, Mustafa Suleyman, warned in a recent interview that the technology will be able to handle "most, if not all, professional tasks" within 12 to 18 months. AI observers are divided over how disruptive the technology will ultimately be, with some forecasting a massive fallout for desk workers and others saying such fears are overblown. Even as agents become more powerful, they're unlikely to replace entire roles in various industries overnight. At the same time, many companies are still figuring out where AI fits into workflows, how workers should validate its output, and how organizations need to adapt, said Muqsit Ashraf, group chief executive of strategy at Accenture. There is often still a role for humans, he told Business Insider. That's despite the share of organizations using agents across multiple functions rising to 31% from 27% in a mid-2025 snapshot. Alex Salazar, cofounder and CEO of AI infrastructure startup Arcade, said that to make the most of agents, workers should treat them like junior employees. Do those three things and "AI will sing for you," Salazar said. AI is "improving at an exponential rate," Salazar said. Do you have a story to share about how AI is changing your job?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iran is ready to consider compromises to reach a nuclear deal with the United States if Washington is willing to discuss lifting sanctions, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi told the BBC in an interview published on Sunday. Iran has said it is prepared to discuss curbs on its nuclear program in return for the lifting of sanctions, but has repeatedly ruled out linking the issue to other questions including missiles. Takht-Ravanchi confirmed that a second round of nuclear talks would take place on Tuesday in Geneva, after Tehran and Washington resumed discussions in Oman earlier this month. "(Initial talks went) more or less in a positive direction, but it is too early to judge," Takht-Ravanchi told the BBC. A U.S. delegation, including envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, will meet with the Iranians on Tuesday morning, a source had told Reuters on Friday, with Omani representatives mediating the U.S.-Iran contacts. Iran's atomic chief said on Monday the country could agree to dilute its most highly enriched uranium in exchange for all financial sanctions being lifted. Takht-Ravanchi used this example in the BBC interview to highlight Iran's flexibility. The senior diplomat reiterated Tehran's stance that it would not accept zero uranium enrichment, which had been a key impediment to reaching a deal last year, with the U.S. viewing enrichment inside Iran as a pathway to nuclear weapons. During his first term in office, Trump pulled the U.S. out of a 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the signature foreign policy achievement of former Democratic President Barack Obama. The deal eased sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program to prevent it from being able to make an atomic bomb. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The off-again-on-again T20 World Cup cricket match between fierce rivals India and Pakistan is now confirmed to take place this Sunday, with the latter desperate for a win against the reigning champions in order to restore some national pride. Bad blood off the field spilled on to it in an ill-natured trio of matches during last year's Asia Cup and certainly won't have been helped by Pakistan's controversial decision to boycott this match — a decision it reversed only a few days ago. It's hard to imagine a world where India don't have their hands on the trophy again when all is said and done on March 7. They have built up to this big-ticket game with comfortable wins over the USA and Namibia. Pakistan almost suffered a shock loss first up against the Netherlands, but bounced back with a resounding win over the USA. Sahibzada Farhan is in a rich vein of form with the bat, while their quintet of spinners (Saim Ayub, Abrar Ahmed, Mohammad Nawaz, Shadab Khan, and Usman Tariq) have used some testing tracks to their advantage. It all sets up an intriguing contest this Sunday, which you can watch for free in some territories. You can watch all the cricket carried by Willow thanks to Sling TV. Willow is one of the channels that make up its Desi Binge Plus and Dakshin Flex packages, both of which cost $10 a month and can be cancelled at any time. New members often get a chunky discount on their first month. Sky TV packages that include sports channels start from £35 a month, or you can add them to an existing Sky plan for £20 a month. Not got Sky and don't want to be tied into a lengthy contract? Alternatively, to watch online, this T20 World Cup game will also be streamed through the JioHotstar app. JioHotstar plans cost from as little as ₹79 a month or ₹499 a year, while selected mobile phone plans include access for free. While free-to-air PTV Sports and Geo Super are showing games on TV in Pakistan, the free Myco streaming platform will also have games online. All you need to do to watch India vs. Pakistan on Myco is sign up for a free account using your email address. T20 World Cup 2026 coverage in Australia looks a little different to what cricket fans are used to, with Prime Video winning the rights to show every game of the tournament. That means to watch India vs. Pakistan, you'll need an Amazon Prime account. After that, subscriptions continue from $10 a month or $80 a year, although you can cancel any time during the 30-day trial. While the 2026 T20 World Cup is being shown by domestic broadcasters in various countries around the world, the organizer's own ICC.TV streaming platform will show free streams in more than 100 other countries. That's everywhere from Albania to Vietnam, and includes several competing nations such as Afghanistan, Italy, Nepal, and the Netherlands.

However, Marcus said he isn't surprised that programmers are beginning to feel fatigued. "Some people in coding, in particular, probably feel like constant pressure, and now they feel like what they're doing is debugging somebody else's code, instead of writing code," he said. The feeling Marcus described echoed what Khare told Business Insider when asked to expand on his AI fatigue. Steve Yegge, a veteran engineer, said companies should limit employees' time spent on AI-assisted work to 3 hours. "I seriously think founders and company leaders and engineering leaders at all levels, all the way down to line managers, have to be aware of this and realize that you might only get three productive hours out of a person who's vibe coding at max speed," Yegge told The "Pragmatic Engineer" newsletter/podcast. "So, do you let them work for three hours a day?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AI disruption jitters have ripped through global stock markets over the last couple of weeks, with sectors across the spectrum ending up in the crosshairs of investors looking to bet on which industry could be upended by the inevitable wave of agentic AI. There will almost certainly be more of these moments this week, as some of the biggest names in AI take to the stage at an event in India. Looking back at last week's volatility could gives some clues for the trading week ahead, as the impact of a series of announcements from US-based AI giants played out from sector to sector, but also across the Atlantic. In Europe, software companies suffered, including Dassault Systemes which saw its share post the biggest ever one-day drop, and RELX, a British analytics group which recorded its worst session decline since 1988. Wealth managers also came under pressure, with names like St James's Place, Aberdeen Group and Quilter all nursing deep losses. In a recent note, UBS analysts said they believe that the AI-driven sell off reflects a "growing disruption is accelerating well beyond software," warning that markets have only partially priced in the credit implications. The Swiss bank expects this risk to increase throughout 2026 and into 2027 in the U.S. and to a lesser extent in Europe. On the other side of the debate, Dan Ives of Wedbush told Squawk Box Europe that the "software Armageddon is overblown," saying that stalwarts like Salesforce and ServiceNow will be core participants of the AI revolution, rather than cannibalized by it. This will all come sharply into focus this week as India prepares to host one of the year's most significant AI summits. Headliners include Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Microsoft's Brad Smith, Mistral AI co-Founder Arthur Mensch and Meta's Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang. CNBC's Arjun Kharpal, who will be covering the event, says to "expect a number of big deals, partnerships and customer announcements from tech companies in the India market. Tech giants are attracted to the large, tech-forward customer base that India presents as well as the huge pool of engineering talent. So expect Prime Minister Modi to roll out the red carpet to Big Tech and all the executives will be more than happy to walk down it." — CNBC's Arjun Kharpal contributed to this report.
