                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A team led by Min Zhang and Dabao Zhang at the University of California, Irvine's Joe C. Wen School of Population & Public Health has developed the most comprehensive maps yet of how genes directly influence one another in brain cells affected by Alzheimer's disease. They reveal which genes are actively controlling others across different cell types in the brain. To accomplish this, the researchers created a machine learning platform called SIGNET. The study also highlights newly identified genes that could become promising targets for future treatments. Although scientists have linked several genes to the disease, including APOE and APP, they still do not fully understand how these genes interfere with normal brain function. "Different types of brain cells play distinct roles in Alzheimer's disease, but how they interact at the molecular level has remained unclear," said Min Zhang, co-corresponding author and professor of epidemiology and biostatistics. Using this method, they constructed causal gene regulatory networks for six major brain cell types. This made it possible to determine which genes are likely directing the activity of others, something conventional correlation-based methods cannot reliably accomplish. "Most gene-mapping tools can show which genes move together, but they can't tell which genes are actually driving the changes," said Dabao Zhang, co-corresponding author and professor of epidemiology and biostatistics. "Some methods also make unrealistic assumptions, such as ignoring feedback loops between genes. The team also identified hundreds of "hub genes" that function as central regulators, influencing many other genes and likely playing an important role in harmful changes in the brain. These hub genes could become valuable targets for earlier diagnosis and future therapies. This additional confirmation increases confidence that the observed gene relationships reflect genuine biological mechanisms involved in Alzheimer's disease. Beyond Alzheimer's, SIGNET may also be applied to the study of other complex diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disorders and mental health conditions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The method involves stitching together many thin “slices” of light reflecting off an object. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. To recreate this effect in an experiment, scientists from Vienna Center for Quantum Science and Technology (TU Wien) and the University of Vienna combined lasers and high-speed photography to turn light speed into something we can witness up close. In the paper, the team—led by corresponding author Dominik Hornof and senior author Peter Schattschneider—explains how physicist Anton Lampa first theorized about these photographic phenomena in 1924. Thirty-five years later, physicists Roger Penrose and Nelson James Terrell separately had the same further insight: a photograph would capture the way the object would appear not condensed (as one might expect), but rotated. In other words, you would go from seeing one face of a cube to seeing two sides and the corner they formed, instead of one distorted single face. “If you wanted to take a picture of the rocket as it flew past, you would have to take into account that the light from different points took different lengths of time to reach the camera,” Schattschneider explained in a TU Wien statement. “This makes it look to us as if the cube had been rotated.” But the speed of light is 299,792,458 meters per second. Our best particle accelerators—like those at CERN or Fermilab—can get close enough, but for various reasons, we can't photograph those particles the right way or observe their shape. Instead, the TU Wien team seemed to take a cue from the iPhone's panoramic mode: What if they sliced an object into micro-thin segments to photograph, then assembled the slices into a composite? To “slice” the object, they used a setup similar to something we usually don't want: the blinding reflection of bright light. In our homes or cars, we shift to avoid the worst of these reflections, but they're exactly what you want when microphotographing light itself. That's like stitching together nearly 150 million photos of your trip to the Grand Canyon. Caroline Delbert is a writer, avid reader, and contributing editor at Pop Mech.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists have identified at least 14 different receptors that respond to the neurotransmitter serotonin. This receptor not only affects learning but also dampens activity in parts of the brain responsible for processing visual information. "This means that visual information about things happening in the outside world becomes less accessible to our consciousness. To fill this gap in the puzzle, our brain inserts fragments from memory -- it hallucinates." In other words, when incoming visual signals are reduced, the brain compensates by pulling stored images and experiences from memory. The researchers also uncovered how this shift unfolds in real time. Psychedelics increase rhythmic patterns of brain activity, known as oscillations, in visual regions. These slower waves stimulated another region called the retrosplenial cortex, a key hub involved in accessing stored memories. As this communication strengthens, the brain enters a different operating mode. Awareness of current external events becomes weaker, while perception relies more heavily on recalled information. The experiments relied on specially engineered mice created by Professor Thomas Knöpfel at Hong Kong Baptist University. These animals were designed to produce fluorescent proteins in specific types of brain cells. "We therefore know exactly in our experiments that the measured fluorescent signals originate from pyramidal cells of the cortical layers 2/3 and 5, which mediate communication within and between brain regions," says Jancke. These cells play a central role in transmitting information across the cortex. Researchers believe that, under medical supervision, these substances can temporarily shift brain activity in ways that encourage the recall of positive memories and weaken deeply ingrained negative thought patterns. It will be exciting to see how such therapies are further personalized in the future," says Jancke.

Understanding the high-level conceptual structure of quantum algorithms from their low-level circuit representations is a critical task for verification, debugging, and education. While traditional numerical simulators can calculate output probabilities, they do not explicitly surface the underlying algorithmic logic, such as the function of an oracle or embedded symmetries. In this work, we shift the focus from numerical simulation to symbolic analysis, investigating whether large language models (LLMs) can automatically interpret quantum circuits and articulate their logic in a human-readable format. We introduce GroverGPT+, a model that leverages Chain-of-Thought reasoning and quantum-native tokenization to analyze Grover's search algorithm. We use Grover's algorithm as a controlled testbed, as its well-defined analytical properties allow for rigorous verification of the model's reasoning process. Our primary finding is that GroverGPT+ successfully identifies the oracle and its marked states directly from circuit representations. The model's key output is not a final probability, but a structured, interpretable reasoning trace that mirrors human expert analysis, effectively translating procedural circuit steps into conceptual insights. Furthermore, we establish a structured benchmark for this symbolic analysis task and explore its empirical extrapolation, describing the model's performance as the number of qubits increases. These findings position LLMs as powerful tools for automated quantum algorithm analysis and verification. More fundamentally, this work offers a first step towards using such models as scientific probes, suggesting that an algorithm's “learnability" by a classical model can provide a new, complementary perspective on its conceptual complexity, a topic of core interest to quantum information science.
