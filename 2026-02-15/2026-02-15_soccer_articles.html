                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Noahkai Banks may be young and still looking for his first U.S. men's national team cap, but that hasn't stopped Landon Donovan from predicting the defender will start at the 2026 World Cup. Banks has become a regular starter this season for Augsburg, despite only recently turning 19. But the defender did not see the field last fall during his only USMNT camp, making next month's camp massive for his World Cup hopes. If he is to make a late charge toward a World Cup spot, Banks will likely need to earn a call-up for friendlies against Belgium and Portugal – the team's last two games before Mauricio Pochettino names his World Cup squad. On his "Unfiltered Soccer" show, the USMNT legend explained why he believes Banks won't just make Pochettino's World Cup squad, but will start this summer. Chris Richards is more than locked and going to play. "I think the team performs best in a back three. "So your options become (Mark) McKenzie, Miles Robinson and even Noahkai Banks. You can maybe move Joe Scally if he makes the team. He's playing in the Bundesliga every week as an 18-year-old. And I just think when push comes to shove, Pochettino might go, 'OK, yeah, he's young. Banks spoke with reporters earlier this week and was asked about his outlook toward the World Cup. The teenager insisted that his only focus for now is on Augsburg, which is currently battling to avoid relegation from the Bundesliga. "I think it's not the right moment to think about the World Cup, because we have a lot of games left here, and we want to win those games because we have goals for the season," he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Giannis Antetokounmpo has explained why he is more Cristiano Ronaldo than Lionel Messi, with the NBA superstar adding his voice to the long-running GOAT debate. The Milwaukee Bucks talisman is hoping to form part of those discussions in basketball circles and sees himself being cut from similar sporting cloth to Portuguese icon CR7 - while being a huge admirer of magical Argentina international Messi. Giannis is, having grown up in Greece, an avid football fan. He follows the game closely, while boasting professional ties to a couple of clubs, and looks to take inspiration from those that have reached the very top of professions that are different to the one that has made him a household name. Messi and Ronaldo have dominated the football scene for more than two decades, with both still going strong in 2026. The former has signed a contract extension at MLS Cup winners Inter Miami through 2028, while the latter is generating transfer talk at Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr. It has been suggested that CR7 could head to the United States, allowing him to either line up alongside or against eternal rival Messi. Giannis is among those that would love to see a stunning transfer thrashed out. Giannis considers Messi to be the ultimate footballing talent, but sees more of himself in Ronaldo - with the evergreen 41-year-old having built his reputation on hard work and dedication to his craft. He is probably, maybe, the best player of all time. “Different people, he's more flashy than me and I'm not like that. “So when you ask me that question, I say Ronaldo but now if you put them, who has accomplished more in their career; eight Ballons d'Or, five Ballons d'Or, World Cup, not the World Cup, five Champions League, four Champions League, it's what you prefer. Giannis has previously said of those that excel with a ball at their feet, rather than in hand: “You have unbelievable players.

Back in 2023, following the Argentine's stunning move to America, Antetokounmpo attended a game with Inter Miami. Whether Giannis is joined in the States by Ronaldo on a long-term basis remains to be seen, as CR7 has returned to action in the Middle East, but he will be on American soil this summer when captaining Portugal at the sixth World Cup finals of his record-shattering career.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>England and Scotland's World Cup group games are at risk with one designated stadium yet to be permitted a licence. Both nations are due to play at Gillette Stadium, home of the New England Patriots, when the action kicks off in June. England are scheduled to face Ghana there in the group stage while Scotland take on both Haiti and Morocco as they bid to qualify for the knockout rounds. That could see world football's governing body opt to swap stadiums due to a cash row between the two parties. Foxborough public officials want FIFA to cough up £6m to cover manpower and infrastructure costs surrounding games at this summer's tournament. It comes after Patriots' owners, the Kraft family, refused to pay for policing and safety costs which host cities are responsible for as part of the hosting agreement. “And if they aren't met, then as this board has discussed in the past, the licence won't be granted. We are going to be very clear with that.” The fallout comes after United States president Donald Trump questioned Boston's right to host games at the World Cup. Trump was previously embroiled in a public spat with the city's Democrat mayor. A settlement between Foxborough and FIFA is expected to be reached in due course. However, local chiefs said their event at Boston's City Hall Plaza, would only be open for ‘up to 16 days'.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brazil's 2002 side are remembered very fondly almost a quarter of a century on, but how good were they considered at the time? In qualification, they lost six of their 18 games, to Paraguay, Chile, Ecuador, Uruguay, Argentina and Bolivia. There briefly seemed a very real possibility that Brazil could be forced into a two-legged play-off against Australia, or even miss out altogether, and went into their final match against Venezuela needing a victory to qualify. But after a dreadful qualification campaign that featured 65 players, five different managers in the dugout, and not a single appearance from Ronaldo, Brazil just about made it to the World Cup. Luiz Felipe Scolari was appointed when Brazil were in a real state, and focused on discipline — on and off the pitch — to ensure qualification for the tournament. Scolari had won the Copa Libertadores with both Gremio and Palmeiras, but had won few admirers for his style of play. With the national side, he omitted players he suspected would cause problems, selected lots of relatively unknown domestic-based footballers as his squad members (giving playing time to his entire squad with the exception of the back-up goalkeepers), and focused on off-field harmony. Largely unpopular going into the tournament, Scolari basically thought Brazil needed to wake up and modernise. “Thirty years ago, you had one or two players who would make a difference to the game. “Brazilian players have great technical ability, but are not much given to tactics. They have flashes of creativity, amazing moves, but without organisation these days, no one wins anything.” “I believe that Pele knows nothing about football,” said Scolari. “He has done nothing as a coach and all his analysis always turns out to be wrong. Scolari was previously regarded as a back-to-basics 4-4-2 man who liked playing with a big target man for others to feed off. But he'd never coached a side with this calibre of attackers, and to Scolari's credit, he based his side around getting the best from his three star attackers. As it became clear that he was building something exciting, the Brazilian press reported on his tactical plans with genuine shock. The three Rs of Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho — always listed in that order — were allowed to remain in central positions, drift around, and combine at will. Not only did they provide the attacking width and allow the forwards to remain in positions close together, but they also had a habit of playing long crossfield balls to one another. They were, despite playing on opposite flanks, a genuine partnership. Juninho made way for Kleberson, who pushed forward more than Gilberto, but was a more defensive option than Juninho, a pure playmaker. Gilberto and Kleberson formed an unfashionable midfield duo largely unknown outside Brazil. Gilberto had made his international debut the previous October, and Kleberson had made his four months before the tournament. Many in Europe would even have been unfamiliar with the names of their club sides, Atletico Mineiro and Athletico Paranaense. Roque Junior was considered something of a joke figure by many Milan fans, Lucio was the hardman but made a terrible error to let in Michael Owen to open the scoring in the quarter-final, while Edmilson pushed forward at times and provided the best example of joga bonito with a superb overhead kick in a 5-2 group stage win over Costa Rica. Both Ronaldo and Rivaldo had scored once in each of Brazil's first four matches, while Rivaldo kept up his record by scoring in the quarter-final win over England. free kick that sailed over David Seaman and in. Shortly after that, however, he was sent off and therefore suspended for the semi-final. 17 years ago #OnThisDay , everyone was asking, did 🇧🇷@10Ronaldinho mean it 🤔 After seeing the player he became, are there still any doubters? Rivaldo, meanwhile, wasn't overwhelmingly popular due to his embarrassing playacting to get Turkish defender Hakan Unsal sent off in a group game, but he was at least as good as Ronaldo. World Soccer magazine called him “consistently Brazil's best player over the seven games”. At the semi-final stage, Ronaldo took charge, scoring a toe-poked finish which caught out Turkey goalkeeper Rustu Recber and then both goals in the final. Ronaldo didn't score for Brazil between September 1999 and a pre-tournament friendly in May 2002 because of repeated knee injuries. He'd played only 17 games for Inter in the three seasons leading up to this tournament. It's difficult to think of another footballer who has missed such a substantial part of his career and returned to such a high level — Ronaldo wasn't quite as explosive as during the 1998 tournament, but he was livelier than anyone expected and remained an outstanding finisher. After the final, he was keen to credit his physiotherapist, Nilton Petrone. Ronaldo won that year's Ballon d'Or ahead of his team-mate Roberto Carlos, who was favoured by some, having won both the European Cup and World Cup. In the calendar year, he scored only nine league goals; four with Inter before the tournament, and five with Real Madrid, having forced a transfer shortly afterwards. This angered many at Inter, who had waited three years for him to find fitness, had celebrated his superb tournament, then found him desperate to leave the club immediately. Germany were not a particularly good side, and were overwhelmingly reliant on attacking midfielder Michael Ballack, who scored the winner in 1-0 victories over the USA and South Korea in the quarter-final and semi-final. But the World Cup final during this period had a curious habit of making the main man the fall guy: Roberto Baggio in 1994, Ronaldo in 1998, Kahn here, and — spoiler alert — Zinedine Zidane in 2006. Germany offered little attacking threat, although a 30-yard Oliver Neuville free kick was turned onto the post by goalkeeper Marcos. Brazil dominated without ever turning on the style, although their second goal was a rare example of good combination football, when Rivaldo dummied a pass from Kleberson — probably the best player in the final — for Ronaldo to slide home a second goal and ensure that this was his final. 🇧🇷🏆 On this day in 2002, Brazil won their fifth #FIFAWorldCup! The trophy was lifted by Cafu, who had become the first and only man to play in three World Cup finals. He stood up on the somewhat wobbly plinth to lift the trophy, with ‘100% Jardim Irene' — the name of his hometown — scribbled on his shirt, and mouthed ‘I love you' to his wife as he held aloft Brazil's fifth, and most recent, World Cup. “Brazil are a wonderful team,” said Germany manager Rudi Voller. More than his two simple finishes in the final, it was Ronaldo's semi-final winner against Turkey that probably lives longest in the memory. There's no doubt it was an error by Recber — another goalkeeper who had been excellent until one fatal error — but given his injury problems, there was something deeply satisfying about watching Ronaldo being, well, Ronaldo. He came short to receive the ball, showed a decent turn of speed, and then surprised Rustu with a toe-poked finish, which brought to mind his old strike partner Romario (hero in 1994, out injured in 1998, and controversially omitted here). 🇧🇷 @Ronaldo's toe poke sent Brazil to the Final on this day in 2002! There were other great moments, too: Edmilson's overhead kick against Costa Rica, Rivaldo's calm finish to equalise against England after some classic Ronaldinho trickery, and then Ronaldinho's free-kick winner later in that game. Joint-favourites France and Argentina, who both had exceptional records coming into the World Cup, both failed to get out of their group. The other two sides ranked ahead of Brazil in the pre-tournament betting, Italy and Spain, both fell to co-hosts South Korea. Of the traditionally strong nations, Brazil only needed to get past England and Germany, neither of whom had a particularly golden generation at this point. None of this is Brazil's fault, but there were clear flaws in this side that weren't exposed in a strange World Cup with plenty of great stories, but very few great sides.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nigeria's hopes of qualifying for the 2026 FIFA World Cup hang in the balance as FIFA prepares to deliver a crucial ruling on Monday, February 16, on the country's eligibility protest against DR Congo. The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) lodged a formal complaint on December 15, 2025, alleging that six DR Congo players who featured in the November 2025 African playoff final were ineligible due to recent switches in international allegiance. Nigeria were eliminated from direct qualification in heartbreaking fashion after losing 4–3 on penalties following a tense playoff encounter, effectively ending the Super Eagles' World Cup campaign—unless FIFA rules in their favour. NFF General Secretary Dr. Mohammed Sanusi expressed confidence in the federation's case. “We have a good case,” he said. “We do not venture into what would be an exercise in futility. Super Eagles midfielder Alex Iwobi also shared the optimism among players and fans. If FIFA rules in Nigeria's favour, the Super Eagles would be reinstated and advance to the six-team Intercontinental Play-Off tournament scheduled for March in Mexico. “We are waiting but Nigeria doesn't deserve to be at the World Cup through the back door. Dr Congo should fought for the ticket,” wrote @YahuzaAmadu. How is it even possible that Dr Congo will make such mistake knowing fully well that they will be disqualified?” asked @obikrasi. “Nigerians from time immemorial likes to ‘hope'. Let see how it's pans out,” added @Ezy3030. “Both footballing terms and economical viability FIFA would always choose Nigeria, but whatever happens at the end, one thing is crystal clear rules of the game must properly adhere to irrespective even if DR Congo has CAF Secretary General on their arms,” said @iAmPODii. I really just cannot wait at all. “They should do this thing once and for all, we are tired of holding a calculator every time we hear FIFA,” said @abn_tel. Others questioned the fairness of a potential reinstatement. “Well let's see but if Nigeria later made there way to world cup I don't think it's fair because they don't really deserve it,” posted @Rouphages. “I pray it is in Nigeria favour Omo e go too sweet,” wrote @THEALONE__BOY, while another added, “We deserve the spot more considering our performance at the afcon.” Comments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A turbulent period for Marseille has delivered more drama, with disgruntled supporters trying to storm presidential suites at Stade Velodrome. Said contest saw Mason Greenwood among the goals again, but Marseille threw away a commanding lead to drop two points in dramatic fashion. Strasbourg found a route back into the game with 73 minutes on the clock, before restoring parity through Joaquin Panichelli when a 97th-minute penalty was awarded. They reported that “tensions rose even further around the Stade Velodrome” after seeing Marseille held to a draw on home soil. As a security measure, access to the Jean-Bouin stand was subsequently closed.” Calm was “subsequently restored”, but those in power at Marseille have been offered another reminder of how supporters are growing tired with questionable performances on and off the field. Stalemate against Strasbourg has left Marseille fourth in the Ligue 1 table, 12 points adrift of leaders Lens. Reports in France claimed that De Zerbi's “relationship with his players had become strained and the Italian knew he was leaving”. It is claimed that the Italian's position had “become untenable”. Late-night talks were held regarding his future, with the decision ultimately taken to part ways. RMC Sport, citing a ‘friend' of De Zerbi, claimed that De Zerbi knew his time was up “on the evening of the match in Paris” - as he admitted afterwards to having “no answers” and that he “did not understand his team”. De Zerbi is a demanding character and is said to have been left “devastated” by the attitude of his players following their demoralising Champions League exit - which came on the back of a 3-0 defeat to Club Brugge on the final matchday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Reports in Italy suggest that the International Football Association Board (IFAB) will move to change a major VAR rule in time for the 2026 FIFA World Cup in North America following the controversial scenes during Saturday evening's Derby d'Italia between Inter and Juventus. Inter claimed a 3-2 victory in the derby thanks to an own goal from Andrea Cambiaso and individual efforts from Pio Esposito and Piotr Zielinski, but their victory has been somewhat overshadowed by the refereeing controversy that led to the first-half sending off of Juventus defender Pierre Kalulu. Kalulu was sent off in the 42nd minute for two bookable offences. There have been suggestions that his original yellow, for a foul on Nicolo Barella, was slightly harsh, but the second has been deemed ‘non-existent' and ‘absurd' by newspapers in Italy on Sunday. That is because Inter's Alessandro Bastoni was deemed to have dived in an attempt to get Kalulu sent off. This is a topic that was already raised during a recent IFAB meeting on January 20, and will be reviewed at the annual assembly in Cardiff, Wales on February 28. La Gazzetta dello Sport reports that the signals indicate towards IFAB voting in favour of allowing VAR to intervene on second yellow card offences, and that this new change in rules could come into effect in time for the 2026 FIFA World Cup in North America.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nigeria lost to DR Congo in the World Cup qualificcation play-offs The Federation of International Football Association (FIFA) is set to deliver a verdict on Nigeria's protest against the Democratic Republic of Congo over player eligibility in the 2026 World Cup qualifiers on February 16. The controversy stems from a petition reportedly submitted by the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), questioning the eligibility of several DR Congo players who were born or raised abroad but now represent the Central African nation at the international level. The argument is that DR Congo's constitution does not permit dual nationality, yet several of its internationals are believed to retain foreign citizenship. According to Nigerian outlet Daily Post, FIFA has set Monday, February 16, 2026, as the date the verdict will be released following the conclusion of investigations. It has been reported that Nigerians are hopeful they will automatically inherit the slot if the ruling goes in their favour, allowing them to represent Africa in the Intercontinental play-offs scheduled for March 2026. Recently, NFF General Secretary Dr Mohammed Sanusi, after submitting the petition, stated that they have a concrete case and are hopeful of a favourable outcome. We don't go into things that would be a waste of time. Meanwhile, DR Congo has denied the allegations made by the West African country, labelling them “bad losers” and accusing them of acting desperately after losing in the play-offs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SEATTLE — Downtown Seattle was filled with cheering fans as the Seahawks' championship parade and trophy ceremony drew tens of thousands to Lumen Field on Wednesday. While fans celebrated, city and event leaders were already looking ahead, using the event to test systems and coordination for future large-scale events, including this summer's FIFA World Cup. "In comparison to the 2014 Super Bowl victory parade, when we didn't have bicycle barricades along the route, that actually slowed the parade down because there was a sea of people, and it wasn't safe," she said. "Putting bicycle barricades along the parade route this year helped keep fans safe and allowed the parade to keep moving, so fans didn't have to wait as long to see their heroes with the team. Planning involved multiple agencies, including the Seahawks, Seafair, and departments like the King County Sheriff's Office, Amtrak, Metro, and Sound Transit. The event also provided a test run for World Cup preparations, Knox said. Collaboration with the Seattle Police Department enabled agencies to practice coordination, communication, and traffic management. "It makes it so much easier when you are executing on a World Cup, because relationships have been developed, systems are now in place, and understanding where there might be traffic congestion or a better traffic flow," she said. Knox noted that community partnerships were crucial. Local businesses, especially restaurants and hotels, also benefited from the influx of visitors. The Sports Commission will host the "Region Ready Summit" on February 23, bringing together community groups, businesses, tourism and hospitality organizations, sports entities, and local government to review best practices. "People around the world get to see the incredible joy, unity, and inclusiveness that make up our region," Knox said. "Those are our core values, and it really reminds the rest of the world what an amazing place Seattle is." A Round of 32 match is locked in for July 1 at 1 p.m. PT, followed by a Round of 16 contest on July 6 at 5 p.m. PT.</p>
