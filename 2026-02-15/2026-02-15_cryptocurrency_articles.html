                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Never miss an important update on your stock portfolio and cut through the noise. Over 7 million investors trust Simply Wall St to stay informed where it matters for FREE. If you are wondering whether CleanSpark's current share price lines up with its underlying value, this article will walk through the key signals without the noise. Recent news coverage has focused on how bitcoin mining companies are reacting to changing market conditions and capital needs, which helps frame sentiment around CleanSpark. Next, we will look at what different valuation methods say about the stock, before finishing with a more rounded way to think about value beyond the usual models. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown. The DCF model estimates what a company could be worth by projecting future cash flows and discounting them back to today, allowing a comparison between that value and the current share price. The latest twelve month free cash flow is a loss of $1,423.62 million. Looking ahead, the model uses analyst input where available, including a projected free cash flow of $109 million in 2026 and $8 million in 2027, then extends further years using its own extrapolations. After discounting all these projected cash flows back to today, the estimated intrinsic value comes out at roughly US$0.41 per share. Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests CleanSpark may be overvalued by 2316.3%. Discover 53 high quality undervalued stocks or create your own screener to find better value opportunities. The preferred multiple here is the P/S ratio, which can be useful for companies where revenue is a clearer anchor than profits, especially if earnings are volatile or negative. It lets you see how much investors are currently paying for each dollar of sales. Slower expected growth or higher risk usually point to a lower one. So context around the business and its industry really matters. Simply Wall St's Fair Ratio for CleanSpark is 3.11x, which is its proprietary estimate of what the P/S could be given factors such as growth profile, industry, profit margin, market cap and key risk indicators. This Fair Ratio aims to be more tailored than a simple comparison with peers or the broad industry, because it adjusts for company specific traits instead of assuming all software names deserve the same multiple. P/S ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation. On Simply Wall St you can use Narratives, where you set out your story for a company like CleanSpark, link that story to specific forecasts for revenue, earnings and margins, and then see a Fair Value that updates automatically when new information such as news or earnings arrives. This makes it easy to compare that Fair Value to the current price and decide what action, if any, makes sense for you, whether you lean closer to a very optimistic view that supports a Fair Value of US$30.00 or you are more cautious and prefer something nearer US$14.69, both of which you can explore and customise within the Community page alongside other investors' views. Do you think there's more to the story for CleanSpark? This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Centre on Sunday launched a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)-based public distribution system (PDS) in Gujarat's Gandhinagar. Union Consumer Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi said the introduction of CBDC in the PDS marks a significant milestone towards ensuring transparency, efficiency, and beneficiary empowerment in India's food security architecture. He said India's PDS—the largest food distribution system in the world serving more than 80 crore beneficiaries—continues to evolve through technology-driven reforms. Joshi said under the CBDC framework, digital coupons generated through the Reserve Bank of India will be credited directly to beneficiaries as programmable digital currency. “Beneficiaries can redeem their entitled quantity of foodgrains at Fair Price Shops (FPS) using CBDC coupon or voucher codes. The system will address challenges related to biometric authentication and e-POS operational issues while ensuring secure, traceable, and real-time transactions. The pilot will soon be expanded to the Union Territories of Chandigarh, Puducherry, and Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu,” he added. Over the past several years, the Department of Food and Public Distribution has undertaken extensive digital transformation of India's food security ecosystem. Key initiatives include end-to-end digitisation of ration cards and nationwide portability under the One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) framework, deployment of e-POS devices for Aadhaar-enabled authentication and real-time transaction capture, and implementation of data-driven validation through the Rightful Targeting Dashboard. It was started by Sardar Dyal Singh Majithia, a public-spirited philanthropist, and is run by a trust comprising five eminent persons as trustees.The Tribune, the largest selling English daily in North India, publishes news and views without any bias or prejudice of any kind.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The blockchain-based assets, which more often than not took the form of cartoon pictures of silly-looking avatars like “CryptoPunks” to “Pudgy Penguins,” were selling like hot cakes. Even big shot celebrities were lining up to secure NFTs belonging to once-popular collections, like Yuga Labs' Bored Ape Yacht Club. In the midst of the craze, pop sensation Justin Bieber shelled out a hefty $1.3 million for a Bored Ape, an enormous sum of money for the rights to an image of a particularly glum-looking ape that appears to be on the verge of tears for some unknown reason. Unsurprisingly, the questionable splurge turned out to be a hilariously bad investment. As Benzinga reports, the ape is now worth a measly $12,000, meaning that it's lost over 99 percent of its value over the last three and change years. The controversial crypto market has been going through an “NFT winter” following a brutal and extended crash. In one particularly bizarre incident, partiers at a Bored Ape Yacht Club event in Hong Kong were alarmed after their eyes started burning, which later turned out to be caused by the event's excessive use of UV light. The company has also had to deal with a class action lawsuit that accused it of using celebrity endorsements to sell an unregistered security. The Securities Exchange Commission started an investigation into Yuga Labs in 2022, which concluded in March of last year, two months into Trump's second term. The regulator's takeaway was that NFTs weren't securities after all. However, being let off the hook by regulators hasn't exactly improved the situation, as more and more collectors are abandoning their NFTs. Despite waning demand, Yuga Labs isn't ready to call it quits. Earlier this year, the company announced it was looking to open an IRL Bored Ape clubhouse in Miami, featuring NFT galleries, event spaces, and “exclusive content” only members can explore. While Bieber remains the proud owner of Bored Ape Yacht Club #3001, others are looking to cut their losses.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gandhinagar (Gujarat) [India], February 15 (ANI): Union Home and Cooperation Minister Amit Shah launched the nation's first Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)-based transparent, modern and user-friendly Public Distribution System in Gandhinagar. This MoU will establish a pre-litigation grievance redressal ecosystem to ensure issues are resolved before reaching the courts. However, under the Prime Minister's leadership, India has emerged as a global leader in digital transactions, with nearly half of the world's total digital transactions taking place in India. Speaking further on digital transformation, HM Shri Amit Shah said that technology-driven reform is now becoming a reality in delivering affordable food grains to the poor. Under this initiative, modern systems such as the CBDC project and the 'Made in Gujarat' Annapurti Grain ATM have been made operational. The CMO stated that he emphasised that this new technology-based framework will eliminate corruption and remove middlemen, ensuring that citizens in remote villages, districts, and backward regions receive their full food grain entitlements directly and transparently. Congratulating all participating institutions as well as the Central and State departments associated with the CBDC project, HM Amit Shah said that this modern system truly embodies the Prime Minister's mantra of 'Minimum Government, Maximum Governance.' This food security framework has now become digital and transparent. Elaborating further, Amit Shah stated that the Annapurti machine will enable the distribution of 25 kg of grain in just 35 seconds, ensuring complete accuracy in weight, value, and quality. As a result, beneficiaries across the country will receive their entitled quality rations conveniently and with full transparency. He said that over the past decade, procurement of food grains from farmers at Minimum Support Price (MSP) has increased fifteenfold, while the agriculture budget has increased from Rs 26,000 crore to Rs 1,29,000 crore. He further noted that in International Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), India's dairy, agriculture, and fisheries sectors have been provided comprehensive protection, thereby ensuring security for domestic producers while also opening global markets for Indian products. On this occasion, Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel stated that under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the guidance of HM Amit Shah, a new chapter in public welfare is being written with the mantra of 'Je Kahevu Te Karvu.' Referring to the transformative power of technology, CM said that overcoming earlier doubts about digital payments, India has today established itself as the world's largest user of UPI. He noted that Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT), Jan Dhan, Aadhaar, and Mobile--strengthened further by AI-based database connectivity--have ensured that the benefits of government schemes reach beneficiaries directly and transparently. He added that this facility will enable workers and members of the labour class to collect wheat, rice, and pulses entitled under the National Food Security Act at their convenience, even after working hours, marking a significant step toward empowering each citizen. Speaking about the CBDC-based Public Distribution System, the CM said this technology will provide beneficiaries with precise information on subsidies, product weights, and pricing via digital tokens. He emphasised that digital tracking and real-time monitoring will ensure complete transparency in the delivery of benefits, thereby fulfilling the government's commitment to a 'saturation approach'--reaching every eligible beneficiary without exception. CM expressed confidence that after recently connecting cattle-rearers with AI-driven solutions through Amul, this technology-based initiative in the Public Distribution System would also prove to be a milestone. He stated that this innovative initiative will further strengthen the world's largest food security program, which is being implemented under the Prime Minister's guidance. He added that integrating advanced technology into the grain distribution system was once a major challenge, but under the 'Digital India' campaign, this task has become significantly easier and more efficient. He stated that with the nationwide digitisation of ration cards, the vision of 'One Nation, One Ration Card' has been successfully realised. Through digital coupons introduced under the initiative of the Reserve Bank of India, beneficiaries can collect food grains at any time by simply scanning a QR code at a Grain ATM. He added that even beneficiaries with basic mobile phones will be able to access the facility, as the system will enable grain distribution via OTP verification sent via SMS. Since the digital entitlement for food grains will be credited directly to the beneficiary's wallet, it can be used exclusively for purchasing grain from fair price shops and Grain ATMs, preventing misuse elsewhere. The introduction of this digital grain distribution model in Gujarat is expected to create a positive ripple effect across other states, helping to eliminate duplicate ration cards and further strengthen transparency nationwide. In the past, issues such as middlemen and long queues at ration shops often delayed the delivery of government grain to beneficiaries. He emphasised that the CBDC-based Public Distribution System project will provide a lasting solution to these challenges. He said that traditionally, the initial benefits of new technologies have often reached large industrialists first. He stated that beneficiaries will no longer have to wait for shopkeepers, as they can collect their entitled grain from a Grain ATM at any time, 24 hours a day, within just five minutes. The system guarantees precision, with not even a one-gram variation in weight, making it a strong example of 'Digital India' in action. He added that Gujarat's forward-looking model--integrating CBDC, Grain ATMs, and biometric-based systems--will serve as a guiding framework for the entire nation, ensuring that the rightful beneficiary receives their due transparently and without inconvenience. In her welcome address, Mona Khandhar, Additional Chief Secretary of the Food and Civil Supplies Department, provided detailed insights into the entire program and its innovative initiatives. She stated that under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India is steadily advancing toward a digital revolution. She added that with the introduction of India's Central Bank Digital Currency--e-Rupee--a new era of modern fintech has begun in the country, and Gujarat is poised to take a leading role in this transformation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A divergence in global bitcoin BTC$68,559.60 market sentiment is widening as U.S. institutional investors hold steady while offshore traders retreat from their positions. CME, the go-to platform for hedge funds and institutional desks in the U.S., shows traders are still paying a premium to stay long on bitcoin, according to NYDIG's head of research, Greg Cipolaro. This is evident on a one-month annualized basis, essentially the markup for futures over spot prices, which remains higher than on its offshore counterpart, Deribit. “The more pronounced drop in offshore basis suggests reduced appetite for leveraged long exposure,” Cipolaro wrote. “The widening spread between CME and Deribit basis functions as a real-time gauge of geographical risk appetite.” If quantum risk were truly weighing on crypto, those stocks would be rising while bitcoin falls. Instead, they dropped together, pointing to a broader decline in appetite for long-term, future-driven assets. On top of that, search data on Google Trends shows interest for “quantum computing bitcoin” rises when the price of BTC rises.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Together, these tales demonstrate how governments and businesses in Latin America are experimenting with new models for reserves, investments, and daily financial access, making the region a crucial arena for crypto policy and innovation. A proposed labour reform that would have enabled employees to receive their salaries directly in digital wallets for the first time was initially embraced by Argentina's fintech industry. But ultimately, lawmakers eliminated the clause, which was generally interpreted as supporting traditional banks. Employees are required by law to receive their pay through conventional bank accounts. This indicates a long-standing mistrust of the institution following incidents like the 2001 “corralito,” ongoing inflation, and frequent limitations on accessing funds. Fintech platforms have thereby made financial access more widely available, with many users turning to apps like Mercado Pago, Modo, Ualá, and Lemon as their main gateway to official digital finance. Brazil considers a strategic Bitcoin reserve and crypto tax exemption The plan calls for removing taxes on cryptocurrency gains and establishing a Sovereign Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (RESBit). Additionally, the law repeals an existing rule requiring brokers and investors to register all cryptocurrency transactions and permits the payment of federal taxes in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is positioned as a strategic reserve that might underpin Brazil's digital currency, the Drex, and it also offers a complete income-tax exemption on gains from Bitcoin and other digital assets. Strategic alliance aims to tokenize $100 million for Salvadoran SMEs Through an integrated infrastructure that blends financial structuring, regulatory compliance, and blockchain technology, the effort intends to employ regulated tokenised equity instruments to link local businesses with global finance. Stakiny, a platform requesting permission from the National Commission of Digital Assets to tokenise equity in private enterprises, will supply the technological backbone. In order to provide real-time cap table management, dividend distribution, governance events, and secondary trading, the model will connect conventional shareholder agreements with digital tokens registered on-chain. To enable tokenised investing for both crypto-native and conventional investors, the platform is made to run on an EVM-compatible network and be accessed via a mobile wallet with biometric authentication.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>India accounts for more than half of the world's total digital transactions, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said on Sunday while launching the country's first Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)-based Public Distribution System (PDS) in Gujarat's Gandhinagar. Speaking at a function held at Mahatma Mandir, HM Shah said India's rapid digital transformation over the past decade had enabled the government to integrate advanced technology into welfare delivery. "A decade ago, nearly 60 crore people in the country did not have bank accounts. He inaugurated a transparent and technology-driven PDS based on CBDC, integrated with Aadhaar-based biometric authentication and the Reserve Bank's payment systems. HM Shah said the initiative would remove leakages in subsidised food grain distribution. Distribution of 'chana' and 'tur' dal in sealed one-kilogram packs was also introduced, along with the ‘Garima Poshan – Suposhit Garudeshwar Taluka' campaign. He added that 2.91 crore women had become 'Lakhpati Didis', reflecting broader efforts at inclusive development. Gujarat Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel said the integration of Jan Dhan accounts, Aadhaar and mobile connectivity had enabled direct transfer of benefits to eligible citizens. "Through digital tokens under the CBDC system, beneficiaries will receive precise information about subsidy, quantity and price, ensuring full transparency," he said. Union Minister for Food and Public Distribution Pralhad Joshi said the initiative was aimed at safeguarding the rights of nearly 80 crore beneficiaries. He said digitisation of ration cards had enabled the 'One Nation, One Ration Card' framework and that beneficiaries could access food grains by scanning QR codes at Grain ATMs or through SMS-based OTP verification. "With the implementation of this technology, an estimated two to three crore fake ration cards have been cancelled," he said, adding that the digital amount credited to beneficiaries' wallets could only be used to purchase subsidised grains. Deputy Chief Minister Harsh Sanghavi said the system would reduce queues at ration shops and allow beneficiaries to collect food grains at any time. "There will not be even a one-gram difference in weight," he said. Separate agreements were also signed with Care Ratings and the Consumer Education and Research Centre to develop a Consumer Responsibility Index aimed at strengthening accountability in the public distribution system.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It has since compressed into a narrowing triangle, printing lower highs and slightly higher lows, a classic bear pennant that often breaks in the direction of the prior move. Ethereum price remains below its 50-day and 200-day EMAs, which now act as overhead resistance. RSI has bounced off its lows but still sits below the neutral 50 level, signaling that buyers have not regained control. A breakdown below pennant support near $1,950 would confirm bearish continuation. A sustained breakout above pennant resistance would invalidate the setup. On-chain data tracked by Arkham shows wallets labeled “Garrett Jin” depositing 261,024 ETH (around $543 million) to Binance in several large tranches over minutes. Arkham's label does not confirm the wallet owner's real-world identity, but it flags a cluster of addresses believed to be controlled by the same entity. Transfers of this size to a centralized exchange typically raise sell-pressure risk because they move supply closer to spot liquidity, even if selling does not occur immediately. Traders will watch whether the deposited ETH begins to distribute across exchange wallets or stays idle. Visible sell-side activity would add pressure to an already bearish chart setup, while a lack of follow-through could limit downside and trigger a short-covering bounce if positioning turns too one-sided. Glassnode shows the 30-day moving average of net flows for Ethereum spot ETFs has been negative for most of the past 90 days, with little evidence of a turn higher. Persistent outflows don't guarantee immediate selling in ETH, but they do signal muted institutional demand, making it harder for prices to absorb large exchange deposits or sustain rebounds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Our team is working diligently to resolve the issue. This comparison focuses on their costs, performance, risk, and structural differences to help clarify which may appeal more to those weighing Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) versus Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH) exposure. Both have similar expense ratios and one-year price declines, but HODL's smaller assets under management (AUM) may matter for investors who prioritize scale. HODL was launched by VanEck on Jan. 4, 2024, and only holds Bitcoin. Six months later, BlackRock launched ETHA, which only holds Ether. Both funds offer direct exposure to the crypto market and share high volatility. For more guidance on ETF investing, check out the full guide at this link. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum posted negative returns in 2025, marking the first annual decline since 2022. It was a wake-up call for many investors who thought the returns on Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies would be endless. Although governments and institutional entities continue to invest in the crypto space, it will still experience ups and downs just like the stock market. With that being said, investors must be cautious when investing in crypto-holding funds, as even though people may not have to worry about digital wallet hacks, the market is very volatile, and it will directly impact the performance of funds such as HODL and ETHA. Throughout the entire existence of both funds, HODL has increased nearly 40%, while ETHA has fallen 41%, but it's still too soon to say whether HODL will perform better than ETHA over the long term. For now, though, HODL shows better promise and holds a cryptocurrency that's much more included in institutional and government development than Ether.
