                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"L.A. does not need another unqualified and inexperienced mayor," writes his sister in a series of tweets. After Spencer and wife Heidi Montag lost their home in the Palisades fire more than a year ago, the reality TV fixture has emerged as an influential and controversial public policy critic. L.A. Mayoral Candidate Spencer Pratt's Memoir is a Book-Length Oppo File But LA does not need another unqualified and inexperienced mayor. “He's just trying to stay famous and sell his memoir don't be fooled. In an ideal world the palisades would have their own mayor and police department. I would love him to be mayor of Palisades but not LA with 4 million people. I'd be impressed if a republican could turn LA democrats thb [sic].” Stephanie then referenced her brother's past, saying L.A.'s mayor should be someone “who wasn't in a cult.” After people on Twitter began responding to her tweets, she then alleged, “Sorry he beat me up when I was 18 & put me in the hospital. She then continued, referencing a 2010 incident, “did anyone know after the cult they went to Costa Rica and were arrested for illegal firearms? He called my dad from jail after not speaking to our family for 8 years bc of his cult, to bail him out … I have no interest in fame, I'm taking a course to become a RBT my passion is helping children and adults with autism. Spencer, 42, sister Stephanie Pratt, 39, and Spencer's wife Heidi Pratt, 39, all starred on MTV's hit reality series The Hills, which aired from 2006 to 2010, and was rebooted in 2019 with The Hills: New Beginnings. Amid his new campaign and with his memoir, The Guy You Loved to Hate, he's taken to referring to his competitors with bullying nicknames and has revisited the fakery of MTV's unscripted The Hills, as well as wife Heidi's well-publicized plastic surgery. “Yes fact – I will always be on team Lauren Conrad,” Stephanie Pratt continued, referring to the famous feud between Spencer, Heidi Pratt and their former Hills co-star. “Those two spent years trying to destroy her life for magazine covers,” she claimed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>David Kaplan, producer of Beth de Araújo's Sundance breakout Josephine, has praised the commitment of Channing Tatum and Gemma Chan to the indie project. Tatum (Roofman) and Chan (Crazy Rich Asians) co-star as the parents of the eight-year-old protagonist Josephine, whose life is upended when she witnesses a violent sexual assault at San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, played by big screen debutant Mason Reeves. In Berlin for the international premiere of the film in competition following its Grand Jury and Audience Award prizes in Sundance , Kaplan told an EFM Conference panel, thatTatum and Chan had taken producer credits on the film for entirely “worthy reasons”. WME Independent Co-Head Alex Walton Talks Involvement In Sundance Breakout 'Josephine' & Indie Revival On Back Of 'Nuremberg' & 'The Housemaid' Success - EFM Sumerian Pictures Snaps Up U.S. Rights To Sundance Breakout 'Josephine' “Gemma's involvement in this film dates back very many years. “Channing was a much later addition but I heard stories from people who were involved in the film and people who weren't involved in the film that he would see people who could finance the film and say, ‘I'm trying to make this film, Josephine, and I believe in it so strongly, and I hope you'll be a part of it,” he continued. And you just don't see that very often. Kaplan revealed the production had come together at the eleventh hour both in terms of the casting and financing, with Araújo scouting Reeves in a farmer's market just seven weeks before principal photography began, having auditioned 90 hopefuls, with the finalists including a “very established actor”. “Mason was only seven at the time… she turned eight on set. We had a little party… she's actually younger than on the page, but she seemed so mature for her age,” said Kaplan. “If we had cast a nine-year-old, we would have been able to work that person more hours every day, so by casting someone younger our schedule had to be longer. Beth had to make compromises creatively to cast this girl who had never acted before… clearly it was the right choice. So, I don't know, sometimes serendipity or just believe the director who knows what she wants.” Kaplan said and the finance plan and project went through several iterations, with 99 percent of the people they approached turning them down. “I think reason number one is perceived commerciality,” he said, on the pushback. “A film like this couldn't possibly be commercial. We need films with Jason Statham, Gerald Butler. you don't need a film about assault,” he said. “I think there's also inherent bias against films that are perhaps more geared towards women and assault survivors. So, I think there's a lack of belief in them as an audience, and a lack of desire to try to find them as an audience.” “We were lucky enough to get a few offers on the film from different companies, although interestingly… nothing worldwide, only deals for the U.S. or international, nothing across. “We never necessarily envisioned this as a film made for streaming… we had a few offers, varying levels of financing, varying levels of theatrical commitment. Obviously, that plays some role in all of this. It was very important to Beth always, that our investors make their money back if they could. “Part of the calculus, on what we decided was, of course, financial, but Sumerian, in addition to making a very meaningful financial offer, also offered a very meaningful screen commitment, a very meaningful P&A commitment,” he continued, saying the company had paid mid to high seven figures. “In this market, that's a huge financial commitment. Giving an update on his upcoming projects, Kaplan said he was hopeful that the It Follows sequel, with David Robert Mitchell returning to direct and led by Neon, on which he is a producer, would shoot this summer.

As Variety previously reported, when competition jury head Wim Wenders was asked about the power of art in fraught times, he said, “movies can change the world … [but] not in a political way.” He later added, when specifically asked about the conflict in Gaza (and, even more specifically, the support that Germany has shown for Israel), Wenders added that as filmmakers, “We have to stay out of politics because if we make movies that are dedicatedly political, we enter the field of politics.

She had been set to screen her 1989 campus comedy “In Which Annie Give It Those Ones” as part of the Classics section. “To hear them say that art should not be political is jaw-dropping. It is a way of shutting down a conversation about a crime against humanity even as it unfolds before us in real time – when artists, writers and film makers should be doing everything in their power to stop it.” Elsewhere, a number of other talents were asked about politics and their own opinions during the festival's first weekend. At a Friday press conference, Michelle Yeoh was asked about the current state of American politics, and commented, “I don't think I am in the position to really talk about the political situation in the U.S., and also I cannot presume to say I understand how it is. So, best not to talk about something I don't know about.” She added that she wanted to “concentrate on what is important for us, which is cinema.” Later that day, Neil Patrick Harris and the team behind “Sunny Dancer” were asked during their own press conference, “Do you dare to criticize your government and do you think democracy in the U.S. is in danger?” Harris reportedly responded, ““Wow. I never read this script as a political statement.” He had previously commented, “I'm always interested in doing things that are apolitical.” Rupert Grint was asked to share his feelings on fascism during a press conference for “Nightborn” (“Obviously, I'm against it. But I choose my moments when to speak. But I think yeah, it's obviously hugely relevant now. All three actors faced almost immediate online backlash, and the fervor around the statements was enough to spark festival head Tricia Tuttle into sharing an official response, one that both proclaimed the power of free speech and art and seemed to chastise those who would ask questions about them in the festival milieu. People have called for free speech at the Berlinale. Free speech is happening at the Berlinale. It is hard to see the Berlinale and so many hundreds of filmmakers and people who work on this festival distilled into something we do not always recognise in the online and media discourse. There are 278 films in this year's programme. There are filmmakers here who have faced violence and genocide in their lives, who may face prison, exile, and even death for the work they have made or the positions they have taken. They come to Berlin and share their work with courage. Are we amplifying those voices enough?There are also filmmakers who come to the Berlinale with different political aims: to ask how we can talk about art as art, and how we can keep cinemas alive so that independent films still have a place to be seen and discussed. In a media environment dominated by crisis, there is less oxygen left for serious conversation about film or culture at all, unless it can be folded as well into a news agenda. Some films express a politics with a small “p”: they examine power in daily life, who and what is seen or unseen, included or excluded. Others have made films which we see as quietly radical political acts which focus on small, fragile moments of care, beauty, love, or on people who are invisible to most of us, people who are alone. They help us make connections to our shared humanity through their movies. And in a broken world this is precious. What links so many of these filmmakers at the Berlinale is a deep respect for human dignity. Artists should not be expected to comment on all broader debates about a festival's previous or current practices over which they have no control. We continue to do this work because we love cinema but we also hope and believe watching films can change things even if that is the glacial shift of changing people, one heart or mind at a time. We thank our team, guests, juries, our filmmakers, and the many others engaged with the Berlinale for cool heads in hot times.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The search for Nancy Guthrie has taken a high-tech turn. The Arizona police department is now flying over the Tucson, Ariz., desert with a Bluetooth signal detector, also known as a signal sniffer, in an attempt to detect a signal from Guthrie's pacemaker. The elderly woman's pacemaker disconnected from the app on her phone just before 2 a.m. on Feb. 1, and her Nest Cam also disconnected around that time. Nancy, 84, the mother of “Today” show co-host Savannah Guthrie, was first reported missing from her home on Feb. 1, after she failed to turn up for church services that Sunday. Her residence quickly became designated a crime scene. Start your day with Page Six Daily. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Several ransom notes have been sent to news organizations, including TMZ, demanding payment in bitcoin by specific deadlines. Last week, the FBI shared frightening photos and video of a masked person approaching Nancy's home in the early morning hours of Feb. 1. At least four people have been detained for questioning, but there has been no breakthrough in the case. Delivery driver Carlos Palazuelos was detained for questioning last Tuesday, but quickly released after maintaining his innocence. Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos confessed that the search for Nancy could take “years” but promised not to give up. “Maybe it's an hour from now,” Nanos told the New York Times on Friday. The FBI also announced that they were upping a reward “for information leading to the location of Nancy Guthrie and/or the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in her disappearance” to $100,000.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nearly three weeks after her beloved mother, Nancy Guthrie, disappeared from her Tucson-area home, there are still more questions than answers. Investigators continue to pursue leads, but there has been no confirmed update on 84-year-old Nancy's whereabouts. For Savannah, the waiting has been deeply personal and painfully public. As the award-winning host and writer moves into her third week, she is said to be quietly reflecting on her future at “Today.” According to NewsNation senior story editor Paula Froelich, Savannah has been weighing whether to step away from the NBC morning show she has co-hosted since 2012. “This absolutely came out of the blue, and I think she's really concerned that it was because of her job,” Froelich said on “NewsNation Prime” Saturday. Froelich added that Savannah has wondered whether past segments filmed at Nancy's home may have unintentionally drawn attention. Behind the headlines and speculation, a daughter is grappling with fear, guilt, and hope, all at once, as she waits for her mother to come home. According to another report in Page Six, Savannah Guthrie is expected to remain off the “Today” show for the “foreseeable future.” “The entire show and network is rallying together in support of our beloved colleague and friend as we navigate this unimaginable time,” the source shared. While Savannah still has more than a year left on her reported $7 million annual contract, insiders have told Page Six that conversations about her professional future feel misplaced right now. “Everyone at ‘Today' is taking this day by day, and of course giving Savannah the grace, time, and support she needs,” another source said, adding that the team continues to “all pray constantly” for a resolution. Froelich suggested that the exposure that comes with national television could be weighing heavily on her as she searches for answers. In the future, safety for her family is expected to take priority. Savannah and her two siblings have turned to social media, posting heartfelt videos asking the public to help bring Nancy home. In one post, Savannah wrote, “We believe she is still alive. As of now, no arrests have been made in the case. The last formal press conference was held on February 5. Since then, Sheriff Chris Nanos has provided updates through selective media interviews. The FBI has shared details about a masked man captured on doorbell footage outside Nancy's home the morning she disappeared. Investigators have also collected DNA evidence from inside the home that does not belong to Nancy or anyone in her immediate circle. Authorities have not disclosed where the material was located.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“There was never a point where I went to bed thinking, ‘The show is probably going to end. We're going to have to pack it up and clean all the crap out of our offices,'” showrunner Matt Selman told Page Six. “The Simpsons” first premiered in 1989, making it the longest-running American sitcom, animated series, and primetime scripted series. It's set in Springfield, following the antics of the iconic cartoon family, including Homer (Dan Castellaneta) Marge (Julie Kavner), Lisa (Yeardley Smith), Bart (Nancy Cartwright) and baby Maggie. Selman said that because the show's ratings have been steady, he never feared cancellation – and when Fox merged with Disney in 2019 and the show hit Disney+, “a whole new generation of younger fans fell in love with the show and it became their favorite show.” Selman has been with “The Simpsons” for over twenty years since 1997, beginning as a writer before moving to exec producer in 2005 and showrunner. “It sort of makes you think maybe we live in a simulation, or something like that,” he joked. Because I consider these to be coincidences. And if there's no coincidences, that's very unlikely.” “The network doesn't really weigh in that much creatively. So maybe there were little things we would have liked to push harder in terms of broadcast standards. I don't remember them,” he explained. Selman acknowledged “The Simpsons” is not trying to be “South Park.” By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. When asked how long he sees “The Simpsons” continuing for, he said, “I think a thousand is a good number. But, I don't know, that will probably be a decision above my pay grade. But, a thousand episodes would be great.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Questions around the miniseries resurfaced after Apple held a press event earlier this month in Santa Monica announcing a slate of new shows, original films, and returning series for the upcoming year. It's an unusual and near-unprecedented months-long delay, especially for a project backed by an A-list star in Chastain, whose production company Freckle Films spent five years developing and making the show. Based on a 2019 Cosmopolitan article, the limited series follows an undercover investigator, played by Chastain, who infiltrates domestic extremist groups to thwart catastrophic large-scale attacks. Although the show isn't believed to have any direct parallels to the events surrounding conservative podcaster Kirk's death on Sept. 10, its premise revolves around online extremism, radicalized hate groups, and themes of political violence. Apple TV did not respond to Rolling Stone's multiple requests for comment regarding the show's future, nor did it respond to questions of whether the program was being shopped around to other distributors. A representative for Prime told Rolling Stone that it was not taking over the show's release, and was waiting on Apple TV to move forward with the series. Trump's Government Is Blowing Off the Epstein Scandal. Jimmy Fallon Cancels Line of Pasta Sauces With Tommy Mottola Over Epstein Friendship “These incidents, though far from encompassing the full range of violence witnessed in the United States, illustrate a broader mindset that crosses the political spectrum and must be confronted,”   she wrote. “I've never shied away from difficult subjects, and while I wish this show wasn't so relevant, unfortunately it is.The Savant is about the heroes who work every day to stop violence before it happens, and honoring their courage feels more urgent than ever.” Chastain ended the lengthy note with a hint of skepticism about whether the series would ever air at all. “I remain hopeful the show will reach audiences soon,” she wrote.

The most uncomfortable scene in “Rosebush Pruning” doesn't involve violence or sexual perversity, although these elements are regularly entangled throughout. Awkward giggles and ruthless stares punctuate silence until the blind matriarch (played by Tracy Letts) asks his daughter to describe Martha's (Elle Fanning) appearance to him in exhaustive detail. Related Stories ‘Free Speech Is Happening' at the Berlinale, Festival Director Tricia Tuttle Promises in Lengthy Statement After Fraught First Days ‘One Battle After Another,' ‘Sinners,' and ‘Frankenstein' Win at 2026 MUAHS Awards, Dedicated to the Best in Make-Up and Hairstyling Craft But then The Father takes it even further, calmly asking his daughter Anna (Riley Keough) to describe Martha's breasts. What's stranger than this request even is how it's demanded without shame (or how Anna uses this to score points in her bid to win Jack over for herself). In turn, it would be easy to describe how the film looks with just as much appreciation for the physical aspects of it too. And yes, there's a temptation to be just as lurid as the father in doing so, because what director Karim Aïnouz achieves here visually is unreal in every sense of the word. Shot with devotion by DP Hélène Louvart, frame after frame looks like it's been ripped from the pages of a fashion magazine that someone like Anna might occupy herself with, eternally bored by the rich comforts that their prison-like home provides. Except there's nothing boring about the pops and splashes of color, all blood-rich reds and luminous yellows that defy the murky greys that have come to define Hollywood in recent years. The cast too are just as gorgeous to look at. It's almost unnatural how good everything looks, and deliberately so. The opening title card, a bold contrast of that same blood-rich red and luminous yellow lingers a little longer than you might find comfortable, signaling a shift into another world that's stranger and more heightened than our own. The cast lean into this fully, often stilted with dialogue just one step out of a natural rhythm. These people are nothing like us, warped through money and transgression until they're barely recognizable as human at all. Even the film's title is lifted from a turn of phrase that Turner's younger son Ed has made up to catch people out, to feel superior and revel in their lack of understanding. What story there is in “Rosebush Pruning” — loosely based on Marco Bellocchio's “Fists in the Pocket” (1965) — is characterized by a similar cadence to the one Filippou developed alongside Greek “Weird Wave” pioneer Yorgos Lanthimos in “Dogtooth” and “The Lobster.” Early on, we're introduced to their monthly visit to the site of her death where they leave behind a sacrificial lamb to honour The Mother's memory and ensure the wolves are well fed so no one else will die at their hands. It's not until toward the end that Ed begins “pruning” his rivals for Jack's attention. Even before that though, everything is pushed to increasingly shocking extremes. This maximalist family saga isn't so much a rallying cry to eat the rich as it is to consume them as their desires devour each other. There are moments where this sweaty mix of comic with the dramatic threatens to almost say something of substance, but then Gage's Robert will sniff his brother's cum-stained towel or we'll finally get to see why The Father loves brushing his teeth so much and it all slips back into farce. Yet these shades of John Waters-like humur are often lost in the film's search for its own protagonist. Jack is the most fleshed out of the siblings, leading his own separate arc opposite a typically great Elle Fanning, and it's in this narrative where the film actually threatens to say something substantial about privilege (given how Martha's wealth still pales in comparison). But that's why it's so odd when the film regularly switches Jack out for Ed's viewpoint instead. Turner plays the middle brother with intriguing melancholy and an almost alien detachment, which works within the world this film creates, but not necessarily for a main character. To center Jack instead, however, might have detracted too much from his role as an object of warped desire within the house. Either way, the result is still opaque in its messaging. Wearying and amusing in equal measure, “Rosebush Pruning” is a visceral, often entertaining social satire without purpose. You could argue there's certainly a demand for this, a need, even, to dismantle privilege in the end days that this world finds itself in. It's just a shame that some of the freakiest moments weren't pruned in favor of something more biting, like the lunchtime trap that Martha finds herself in. After all, wolves don't just wait around for a sacrificial lamb to show up in the forest and their teeth are rarely bared in public.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Foreign governments, royal families, businesses, universities, and cultural institutions are investigating those with ties to the notorious sex criminal, and powerful figures around the world have been forced to step down from influential positions amid revelations that they were a part of his network. The United States, however, doesn't seem to care so much. This week, Attorney General Pam Bondi appeared before the House Judiciary Committee, where she thrice refused to acknowledge a group of survivors sitting in the hearing room, who all affirmed that they had not been granted an opportunity to meet with the attorney general despite their requests. Bondi refused to answer questions about the Justice Department's failure to open investigations in potential coconspirators, and dismissed questions from lawmakers about the department's sloppy handling of sensitive victim information, and about the over-redaction of potentially incriminating information. The White House also shrugged off questions about Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who — although not implicated in any criminality — was caught in a bold-faced lie about the extent of his dealings with Epstein. On Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt abruptly cut off a press briefing after being asked by a reporter if the administration would continue to stand by Lutnick. Mountbatten-Windsor settled a civil lawsuit in 2022 brought against him by Virginia Giuffre, who accused Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell of trafficking her to the former prince and other men when she was a teenager. Now, the UK's Crown Prosecution Service is weighing an investigation into  Mountbatten-Windsor over new evidence that he may have transferred confidential government reports to Epstein while representing the kingdom as a trade envoy. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, meanwhile, is facing calls for his own resignation and a potential vote of no confidence over his relationship with Peter Mandelson, a prominent figure in the Labour Party who was tapped to serve as United States Ambassador under Starmer. Questions about the extent Starmer was aware of Mandelson's relationship with Epstein were heightened after newly released emails revealed that the two men had joked about Epstein's relationships with young women, and that Mendelson may have provided Epstein with sensitive government emails containing privileged financial information.

Two high-level officials in Starmer's administration have resigned in the face of the scandal, Mandelson resigned from the Labour Party this month after being dismissed from his ambassadorship last year, and authorities are exploring a criminal investigation into his conduct. Norway's former Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland has also been embroiled in the scandal. On Thursday, Thorbjørn was charged with corruption by Norwegian authorities in connection to Epstein, after being stripped of his diplomatic immunity earlier this week. Jack Lang, France's former Culture Minister, resigned last week from his position as president of the prestigious Arab World Institute in Paris. In Slovakia, a national security adviser to Prime Minister Robert Fico stepped down earlier this month. Several other countries — including Poland and Lithuania — have opened investigations into the potential trafficking of girls from their nations. On Friday, DP World Chairman and Chief Executive Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem — who was discovered to be one of the names of potential Epstein co-conspirators whose name was redacted in files after a review by lawmakers — resigned from his position atop the Emirati international exporter. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who pushed to unredact the names of Bin Sulayem and five other individuals, wrote on X after Bin Sulayem's resignation that he and other lawmakers would “not rest until there is elite accountability for the Epstein class.” Jimmy Fallon Cancels Line of Pasta Sauces With Tommy Mottola Over Epstein Friendship But in the United States, the Justice Department has staunchly refused to pursue further criminal investigations into Epstein's potential co-conspirators or participants in his trafficking ring.</p>

It is described as “neither a documentary nor entirely fiction.”The film features Bobby Sommer as Bobby, who is always on the road, driving up and down a highway that links the Austrian cities of Vienna and Salzburg. Via a car-sharing service, he picks up other people who are looking to travel the same route while saving money on petrol, including a young man struggling with the country's mandatory military service, a queer woman who is about to get married, a supermarket trainee, and an academic exploring the history of the highway. Gore Verbinski on His AI Comedy Comeback: "It's 2026. Square Eyes is handling world sales for the movie from Panama Film producers David Bohun and Lixi Frank that debuts at Berlin on Monday, Feb. 16. “The most important thing for me was making this film about this particular form of encounter between strangers,” the director explains. Shares Brameshuber: “The road is coming towards you, the landscape is passing by; you're efficiently moving towards a destination while just sitting there relaxed. This experience drags you into a certain atmosphere. Brameshuber shares how Sommer ended up in the film. “I found he had a resemblance to GTO, the character Warren Oates plays in [Monte Hellman's 1971 film] Two-Lane Blacktop,” the director recalls. “And I really liked the scenes in that film where GTO is basically traveling with different passengers and reinventing his story for each passenger. So I sent Bobby the film because he hadn't seen it. And from there, the dialogue with Bobby started. The rest of the casting process focused on finding “young people who were engaging in conversations, willing to share a lot about their lives, but at the same time keeping a bit of a mystery,” explains Brameshuber. “The sequence of views along this motorway was designed by the Nazis to create a picturesque route, which is very interesting to me, because it links back to my previous projects about historically charged locations,” Brameshuber tells THR. That was a nod to the digital age, explains Brameshuber. “It was because Google Maps, or maybe some other navigation system at the time, had these estimates for trips: 13 hours until the destination in current traffic.” “The title is not supposed to be an enigma; it relates to the film in a more associative, poetic way,” he highlights.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Stonewall is not just a park, it is sacred historical ground in the fight for LGBTQ+ rights," the singer wrote. Adam Lambert is speaking out against the removal of the Pride flag at Stonewall National Monument in New York City. In early January, the Trump administration replaced the rainbow-colored flag — a symbol of LGBTQ+ rights and inclusion — with an American flag at the National Park Service–run site in Manhattan's Greenwich Village. “Stonewall is not just a park, it is sacred historical ground in the fight for LGBTQ+ rights,” Lambert, a founding partner of Pride Live and the Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center (SNMVC), wrote on Instagram Thursday (Feb. 12). The singer continued, “The Pride flag is not a political prop; it is a symbol of visibility, resilience, and the countless lives that have fought, and continue to fight, for dignity and equality. Gracie Abrams also made her opinion clear by resharing comedian Benito Skinner's post about it being “Demonic” on her Instagram Story on Feb. 10. Recently elected NYC mayor Zohran Mamdani said in a statement on X that he was “outraged” by the seizure of the flag. New York is the birthplace of the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement, and no act of erasure will ever change, or silence, that history,” he wrote.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hallmark's newest movie, “Because of Cupid,” premieres on Saturday, February 14, at 8 p.m. Eastern/7 p.m. Central. The movie stars Amy Groening and Evan Roderick. Read on to learn all about where the movie was filmed and see behind-the-scenes cast stories. “Because of Cupid” was filmed in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, according to IMDb. Groening shared a post with behind-the-scenes moments on Instagram. Director Liz Farrer shared her own set of behind-the-scenes pictures. Producer Kevin Duda wrote a long post on Instagram in honor of the movie. He wrote, in part: “…Once-in-a-while, I get to see a movie to the finish line that came from my brain (usually after a glass of wine.) For these, I get to work with incredible development execs at the network, passionate writers and then see the movie through from prep to post. From dreaming up this story, building on it with Amy Meyerson, having the wonderful Elise Speiser see its potential, collaborating with Sarah Montana's clever wit, teaming up with the OG Ashley Squires, Larry Grimaldi and the Neshama family & crew (Vinuja, Jordana, Vanessa, Mitch & more), to working with my fave Liz Farrer and a cast of dreams including Evan Roderick, Amy Groening, Adam Tsekhman, Tenille Read, Darryl Hinds, Ric Waugh, Sarah Booth, JT Silver. Tennille Read shared some behind-the-scenes moments as well. And here are some photos from Darryl Hinds: Adam Tsekhman shared a video of “the Cupid shuffle.” Hallmark's synopsis for this movie reads: “Best friends Naomi and Marcus participate in a Valentine's Day mocktail competition but things go awry when Cupid interferes with a love potion that affects Marcus and several of their friends.” Her notable roles include works like “Horizon” on NBC, “Reign” where she has a recurring role, “Backpackers” on the CW, “Bone Cage,” and more. Roderick has numerous film and TV credits to his name, such as “When We Rise,” on ABC, “Project MC2” on Netflix, “Arrow” on the CW, “Secrets of a Marine's Wife,” “Spinning Out,” and more.
