Real estate agent brothers Tal, Oren and Alon Alexander – known as ‘closers' – are on trial in New York for sex trafficking



In their time as real estate brokers, the Israeli-American Alexander brothers – twins Alon and Oren and older brother Tal – were known as “closers”, the salesmen who could a get a sale over finish line, often to wealthy hedge funders who were then making hay in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.

Their technique, one real estate expert explained outside the 26th floor of the federal court house in lower Manhattan last week, was based on the sense that the property salesmen “were just like their clients” – young, eager and successful. Kim Kardashian and then-husband Kanye West, Jared and Ivanka Trump were clients.

And like many, they were party animals. Nightclubs in Manhattan, the Hamptons, Miami, Aspen, Tulum and Ibiza were seasonal stops. Tal and Oren, 38, were profiled in the New York Times on “How Two Luxury Real Estate Agents Spend Their Sundays”. The Wall Street Journal followed on the family's $31m sale of their Miami beach home. US Vogue featured Oren's wedding to a Brazilian model.

But a far nastier picture of their high life has been on display in court for the past few weeks, where the three brothers are on trial for sex trafficking. Prosecutors have accused each of the three brothers of violent, forcible rape of at least 10 women each and in some cases of threatening them if they spoke of their experiences.

The accomplished real estate “closers”, according to prosecutors, took no chances when it came to their pursuit of sex, and worked together in a conspiracy to lure, incapacitate and attack women.

The three brothers have pleaded not guilty and deny the allegations.

The civil case against Oren and his twin began in March 2024 when they were sued by Kate Whiteman, a woman who said she had met at a Manhattan nightclub in 2012. She claimed they had forced her into an SUV as she was leaving and drove her to the Hamptons, where she was assaulted at a party mansion called Sir Ivan's Castle. A flood of similar allegations followed.

But Whiteman is not in court to testify. It was reported last month that she was found dead near Sydney late last year. Authorities in New South Wales have said the circumstances of Whiteman's death “were found to be non-suspicious”.

As the trial entered its third week, the court heard from Abusshan Bodjnoud, a woman who testified that she witnessed an unidentified woman being raped by Tal, 39, and one of the twins in the Hamptons in May 2009. Bodjnoud told jurors she was in the house when a party of men returned and she saw Tal “dragging” a woman who “was not walking on her own” to the pool.

“Then the next thing I heard was a woman screaming and just asking people to stop,” she testified. She said she witnessed Tal and the twin “moaning” as they raped the woman in the hot tub.

Bodjnoud, who said she was “terrified” to intervene, said she had written “rapist” and “you need to apologize” on the brothers' door before she left the house but acknowledged she had not called 911 and was warned that the Alexander brothers “were very powerful”.

A day earlier, jurors were shown text exchanges the government says showed that the brothers coordinated to secure drugs – including ketamine, Xanax, Ambien and GHB – they allegedly used to incapacitate women lured with the promise of luxury travel and exclusive experiences.

In one exchange from September 2011, Alon texted about an upcoming party, telling the recipient to “throw some panty dropper pills in the dishes sent to our table”. Attorneys for the defendants have described some of the references as “crude jokes.”

Maylen Gehret, who is suing Alon and Oren for sexual assault, told the court that Alon raped her in Aspen, Colorado, in 2017 when she was 17. She said she was at a club with two friends when Alon gave her a vodka cranberry. After a second drink, her head began to feel “really heavy” and she could “barely hold it up”.

The twin then allegedly took the girls to an empty hotel room and raped her in the bathroom. “It really hurt, and I was so scared,” Gehret testified.

During the prosecution phase of the case, other accounts have followed a similar path. But when the defense takes its turn, attorneys are set to argue that both the civil lawsuits and criminal allegations against the brothers are an intertwined conspiracy led by women seeking to extort them.

Outside court last week, their father Shlomi Alexander, who emigrated from Israel to the US to start a successful security company before branching into Miami real estate, claimed the cases had begun with a $35m effort to extort him.

Under cross-examination, defense attorneys have pressed witnesses on changes to their testimony, timelines, and claimed that prior statements don't align with what the jury heard. Juda Engelmayer, a crisis PR consultant for the defendants, said the challenges to witnesses rarely make the headlines.

“The coverage often highlights the most sensational passages from direct, or the one line on cross where a witness confidently insists they ‘remember' the single detail anchoring the allegation, while leaving out the broader credibility challenges unfolding in real time”, Engelmayer said.

In opening arguments last month, defense attorney Teny Geragos said the brothers were successful, arrogant young men “who liked and pursued women”, adding “that's not trafficking. That's dating. That's hooking up.”

But she acknowledged the jury may frown upon their lifestyle and vulgar communications. “Two things can be true at once – you can disapprove of their lifestyle and still find them not guilty”, Geragos said before a courtroom packed with family and supporters of the brothers.

            The Department of Justice on Saturday sent Congress a list of “politically exposed persons” in the millions of files released related to its probes into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
    


            The six-page letter, a copy of which was obtained by CNN, includes the names of many prominent figures who appear in the files, regardless of the context, and does not specify the degree to which the people were linked to or in contact with Epstein. The letter is signed by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and addressed to top members on the House and Senate Judiciary Committees.
    


            The DOJ was compelled to produce the list by the Epstein Files Transparency Act passed by Congress.
    


            While some of the people on the list have well-documented ties to the convicted sex offender, others, are not known to have ever personally interacted with Epstein. The list includes presidents, cultural icons, business leaders and government officials.
    


            No one on the list, other than Epstein and his accomplice Ghislane Maxwell, have ever been charged in connection with Epstein's crimes.
    


            The newly released list has drawn the ire of several members of Congress, including Rep. Ro Khanna, a co-author of the law that forced the files' release. He claimed the DOJ is “purposefully muddying the waters on who was a predator and who was mentioned in an email.”
    


            Republican Rep. Nancy Mace, a vocal ally of Epstein survivors, slammed the DOJ in a Saturday night social media post, claiming there are “missing names on the list disclosed this evening.”
    


            As in its previous letters to Congress, the DOJ lists reasons for redacting information in the files that go beyond what the law passed by Congress requires, including documents showing deliberative process, work product and attorney-client communications that would be privileged.

Elation as anti-extremists fight back against influence of billionaire megadonors through grassroots organizing

Chris Tackett started tracking extremism in Texas politics about a decade ago, whenever his schedule as a Little League coach and school board member would allow. At the time, he lived in Granbury, 40 minutes west of Fort Worth. He'd noticed that a local member of the state legislature, Mike Lang, had become a vocal advocate for using public money for private schools – despite the fact that Lang campaigned as a supporter of public education.

With a little research, Tackett found that Lang had received hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign donations from the Wilks brothers and Tim Dunn, billionaire megadonors whose deep pockets and Christian nationalist views have consumed the Texas GOP. Tackett published his findings on social media, and soon enough, people started asking him to create pie charts of their representatives' campaign funds. These charts evolved into the organisation See It. Name It. Fight It.

“There's so many people out there that are so busy with their daily lives, they're walking past and not even seeing some of these bad things going on,” he says. “So that's the first step: you have to see this thing.”

Tackett and his wife Mendi, the organisation's sole members, now live in Fort Worth, where they're part of a scrappy community of progressives and anti-extremist organizers who are building momentum amid their town's deeply embedded Christian nationalism. Tarrant county, in which Fort Worth is the largest city, provided a chilling preview of Texas's gerrymandering efforts, and the county is widely regarded as a hotbed for far-right actors. But most recently, the county was the site of a Democratic victory that sent the Texas Republican party reeling.

Taylor Rehmet, a Democrat and local union leader, won a runoff for a state Senate seat that's been held by Republicans since 1992. What's more, he bested Republican Leigh Wambsganss despite having one-tenth as much money. Much of Wambsganss's funding came from Dunn and the Wilks brothers.

Republicans blamed low turnout for Rehmet's victory, while pundits opined that the Trump administration's unpopularity was to blame. But people in Fort Worth say local organizing was central to the upset – and it will be key to any future victories in Texas, too.

Alexander Montalvo, a longtime grassroots organizer in Tarrant county, points to several examples where local advocates have successfully rallied for causes they believe. There was the pushback against a proposal to split a local school district. Then there were the school board elections last May, where every candidate endorsed by the Christian nationalist cellphone carrier Patriot Mobile lost their election. Patriot Mobile – where Wambsganss works as an executive – had previously racked up several wins across Tarrant county, effectively taking over multiple boards.

Now, after those May losses and Rehmet's win, the company's political influence is in doubt.

“There is something very local here in Tarrant county that is happening and that has been happening,” he says. “There is a collective groundswell that's been building.”

Tackett says he's in close contact with organizers like Montalvo and other Tarrant County residents who meet up for what's called the “817 Gather”: a monthly meeting of people activated by the extremism that's run rampant in their area.

“It's a bunch of folks that are Black, brown, white, mostly progressive, but we've got a few folks that play into that former Republican space, as well,” he says. “It's not about Republican versus Democrat. It's really all about what we stand for, because we can agree that public education is foundational to the success of our democracy. We can agree that a person should have rights over their own body, and it should be easier to vote, not harder to vote.”

People have found their roles within this community, and in one way or another, their efforts always lead back to voting. Montalvo and fellow organizer EJ Carrion, one of the hosts of the local podcast the 817 Pod, frequently inspire large crowds for local city council and county commissioner meetings. The Tacketts publish social media videos spotlighting their concerned neighbors – often as they speak at those local meetings – and putting local extremists on display.

Before Rehmet's victory, their organisation shared a video of Wambsganss appearing on the podcast of former Trump consigliere Steve Bannon. After the election, the Tacketts published a video breaking down how local Republicans reacted to the Rehmet victory at a meeting held the day after Rehmet's win.

In the video, a candidate for Texas agriculture commissioner claimed Texas was at risk of falling under Sharia law. Others framed politics as a spiritual battle that will determine whether the US remains a Christian nation. That meeting was hosted by For Liberty & Justice, a local political organisation affiliated with a Fort Worth church called Mercy Culture which is seeking actively encourage conservative Christians to run for office and break down barriers between church and state in the US.

When it comes to Christian nationalism in Tarrant County, multiple people interviewed for this story say no institution looms larger than Mercy Culture.

“Mercy Culture is not just a church,” says Wesley Kirk, a lifelong Fort Worthian and one of the hosts of the 817 Pod. “It's a political machine. They are organizing people. They are endorsing candidates.”

Chanin Scanlon, a former Fort Worth resident who recently moved to San Antonio, puts it bluntly.

“This is Christian nationalism,” she says. “It's not subtle. They are very clear about what they want. They want to take over institutions.”

The Tacketts have used their popular social media presence to chronicle Mercy Culture's rising influence. But Chris Tackett is also still making pie charts. After the Rehmet victory, he dove deep into the data to see if the narrative about low turnout was true. Turnout was down across the board, he found, which undermined the local GOP's narrative that Republicans who stayed home were the ones to blame.

Using a voter score analysis, Tackett also found that 57% of runoff voters fell into one of two groups: true independents, or “Democratic-leaning voters who regularly vote in Republican primaries because, in ‘deep-red' Texas, the GOP primary is the only election that matters in most cycles.” (Fifty-seven percent is the total percentage of the electorate that Rehmet won.)

“What we saw wasn't massive Republican crossover,” he wrote. “It was Democrats – many of whom have been forced to play in GOP primaries for years – finally getting a meaningful choice and showing up.”

Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor, agrees with the idea that Democrats had a strong candidate to back in the runoff.

“I think they figured out the secret sauce to candidate recruitment,” he says of the Democratic party. “Being an authentic person goes a long way for voters these days.”

Montalvo, meanwhile, finds himself motivated by Tackett's pie chart.

“There's actually a big enough and a diverse enough base amongst Democratic voters in Tarrant county that if we actually invest in those communities, we have the votes to be able to win,” he says.

            When Howard Lutnick had a problem in 2018, he turned to his next-door neighbor for help: Jeffrey Epstein.
    


            Lutnick emailed Epstein's assistant in May 2018 about a proposed expansion to the Frick Collection, a museum one block south of Lutnick's and Epstein's adjacent townhouses on East 71st Street in Manhattan.
    


            “Are you aware as to them building to block our park views. What should we do about it? Time is of the essence,” wrote Lutnick, who was then the CEO of Wall Street firm Cantor Fitzgerald.
    


            “No i was not,” Epstein responded after his assistant forwarded Lutnick's email.
    


            The email exchange shows that Lutnick, now President Donald Trump's commerce secretary, communicated with Epstein more than a decade after he claimed he cut off all contact with the convicted sex offender who died in 2019.
    


            A CNN review of the Epstein documents show numerous interactions between the two men, including an invitation from Lutnick to attend a Hillary Clinton fundraiser in 2015, a $50,000 donation from Epstein for a 2017 dinner honoring Lutnick, a 2013 business venture both invested in, and multiple emails in which Lutnick set up a 2012 visit to Epstein's infamous Caribbean island with his wife, nannies and children.
    


            Lutnick, the highest-ranking Trump administration official prominently named in the Epstein files — outside of the president himself — has faced calls for his resignation on Capitol Hill, where he was grilled Tuesday during a Senate hearing over his ties to Epstein and confirmed he visited Epstein at his island with his family for lunch. Lutnick has not been accused of any wrongdoing related to Epstein.
    


            Interviews with executives and others on Wall Street, where the former Cantor Fitzgerald CEO is viewed skeptically in some corners, show that the Epstein disclosures have sparked a fresh round of questions about Lutnick's future and his role as cheerleader of Trump's tariff-driven trade agenda.
    


            “Lutnick was grossly deceptive. And it's not an ambiguous call,” Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, founder of the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute, said of Lutnick's claims he ended all contact with Epstein in 2005. “Every CEO who shakes hands with Howard Lutnick will want to wash them afterwards.”
    


            But inside the White House, there's no indication that Lutnick — perhaps one of the few Cabinet secretaries Trump considers a personal friend — will face any repercussions. Lutnick traveled with the president on Friday on Air Force One to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where Trump gave his commerce secretary a shoutout during his speech.
    


            If the president's support for Lutnick ever wavers, it won't be over the Epstein files — an issue that Trump has sought unsuccessfully to bury for months, including urging Americans earlier this month to “get onto something else,” people familiar with internal White House discussions told CNN.
    


            A Commerce Department spokesperson said in a statement: “This is nothing more than a failing attempt by the legacy media to distract from the administration's accomplishments including securing trillions of dollars in investment, delivering historic trade deals and fighting for the American worker.”
    


            “Mr. and Mrs. Lutnick met Jeffrey Epstein in 2005 and had very limited interactions with him over the next 14 years,” the spokesperson said.
    


            White House spokesperson Kush Desai said: “President Trump maintains complete confidence in Secretary Lutnick because he has been the most transformative Commerce Secretary in modern history and is a champion of the President's America First trade and tariffs policies.”
    


            The Epstein episode represents just the latest strike against Lutnick for many in Trump's orbit, who have long regarded the commerce secretary as an irritant at best — and at worst, a running political liability, people familiar with the internal discussions said.
    


            Within the White House, one of the people said, Lutnick is increasingly unpopular among aides who view him as an abrasive figure who frequently fans Trump's worst impulses on issues like tariffs — and who has a knack for finding ways to be by the president's side.
    


            Yet even among the sharpest Lutnick detractors in Trump's orbit, there's been little visible effort to leverage the Epstein controversy against the commerce secretary largely because few think it'll make a difference with the only person whose opinion matters: The president himself.
    


            Lutnick alienated a swath of Trump advisers and allies shortly after the 2024 election over his campaign to become Treasury secretary, which touched off a bruising behind-the-scenes battle against Scott Bessent that delayed Trump's decision on the critical Cabinet role for days.
    


            Others still hold Lutnick responsible for cheerleading the rollout of Trump's “Liberation Day” tariffs — a disastrous event that shook global markets and forced the administration to quickly walk back much of its disruptive trade strategy. The Commerce secretary fumbled the administration's messaging on multiple occasions during that period, further irritating officials who were racing to contain fallout from the blanket tariffs and to soothe foreign allies.
    


            Trump has remained a strong supporter of Lutnick. They are fellow New Yorkers who have known each other for decades, and one person familiar with the internal discussions said Lutnick enjoys a protected status as an “FOT” — or Friend of Trump.
    


            Asked Thursday about Lutnick's interactions with Epstein, Trump said he wasn't aware while downplaying his own past relationship with Epstein.
    


            “From what I hear, he was there with his wife and children, and I guess in some cases some people were,” Trump said. “I wasn't. I was never there.”
    


            In October 2025, Lutnick told the New York Post in a podcast interview that he and his wife decided to cut off contact with Epstein in 2005 after the financier showed off a massage table and made suggestive comments while giving the Lutnicks a tour not long after they had moved in next door.
    


            “In the six or eight steps it takes to get from his house to my house, my wife and I decided that I will never be in the room with that disgusting person ever again,” Lutnick said. “So I was never in the room with him, socially, for business, or even philanthropy. If that guy was there, I wasn't going, because he's gross.”
    


            But a CNN review of emails in the Epstein files shows that both Lutnick and his wife in fact communicated with Epstein for many years afterward, including on social, business and philanthropic matters.
    


            In 2011, the Epstein emails show arrangements being made to set up several calls between Epstein and Lutnick.
    


            “Howard Lutnick is on an airplane headed overseas. His office would like to know if you would like to set up a call while he is away or if you prefer to speak with him on Monday April 4th when he is back,” a redacted person emailed Epstein in March 2011.
    


            The next month, Epstein was told in an email from a redacted sender, “Howard Lutnick returned your call.”
    


            In an October 2011 email, Epstein's assistant wrote: “FYI-Howard Lutnik's assistant called asking if you would be available =o speak with Howard today…”
    


            A calendar with appointments shows that Epstein had a 5 p.m. drinks meeting set up with Lutnick on May 1, 2011, 90 minutes before a scheduled dinner with Woody Allen and others. The next day, someone emailed Epstein: “The phone was Howard Lutnicks, it has been collected.”
    


            In 2012, Lutnick and his wife sent a series of emails coordinating a meal with Epstein. Lutnick asked for coordinates for his boat captain, proposing a dinner and noting he was accompanied by his wife, another couple and each family's four children.
    


            “Below from Jeffrey: come sat or sunday lunch? little st jamcs on the map, behind christmans cove,” a redacted sender responded to Lutnick.
    


            Lutnick's wife followed up with Epstein's assistant asking where to anchor, writing in a subsequent email that they were arriving on a “188 foot yacht.”
    


            At Tuesday's Senate hearing, Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland pressed Lutnick about the lunch and his prior claims of cutting off contact in 2005.
    


            “The issue is not that you engaged in any wrongdoing in connection with Jeffrey Epstein, but that you totally misrepresented the extent of your relationship with him, to the Congress, to the American people and to the survivors of his despicable criminal and predatory acts,” Van Hollen told Lutnick.
    


            Lutnick acknowledged visiting the island while on vacation, but said that he saw nothing untoward and that he was there only briefly with his family.
    


            “Probably the total, and you've seen all of these documents of these millions and millions of documents, there may be 10 emails connecting me with him, probably about 10 emails connecting me with him, over a 14-year period. I did not have any relationship with him,” Lutnick said. “I barely had anything to do with that person, OK.”
    


            Lutnick's dealings with Epstein continued in the years that followed.
    


            In 2013, Lutnick and Epstein both appear to have invested together through their business entities in an advertising analytics firm, according to a contract included in the Epstein files.
    


            In 2015, Lutnick invited Epstein to the Hillary Clinton fundraiser. It's unclear whether Epstein attended. And in 2017, Epstein donated $50,000 to a dinner honoring Lutnick hosted by the UJA-Federation of New York.
    


            Billionaire investor John Paulson, who was UJA's chairman of its Wall Street & Financial Services division, wrote in an email invitation to Epstein's assistant: “As Chairman of the Wall Street Division, I want to make sure that as a close friend of the Lutnicks, you are aware of the event and have the opportunity to support them.”
    


            Epstein responded, “50k from me, hope pr is ok”
    


            Lutnick's inclusion in the Epstein documents prompted calls for his resignation last week on Capitol Hill, including from Rep. Thomas Massie, the Kentucky Republican who co-authored the legislation mandating the release of the files.
    


            “[Lutnick] said he knew Jeffrey Epstein was a despicable, abhorrent human being and had nothing to do with him, and then he partied on his island with his kids, with this guy. How do you trust that guy?” Massie said Wednesday.
    


            Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters that Lutnick will have to answer questions about his relationship with Epstein, but argued it is “up to the American people” to say whether his answers are “sufficient.”
    


            Rep. Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican who also pressed for release of the Epstein files, said she was “concerned with anyone who would hang out with a convicted pedophile” when asked about Lutnick.
    


            “Anyone who hangs out with a guy like that, I'm sorry but I'm not hanging out with you,” Mace said.
    


            On Wall Street, there was mixed reaction over the Lutnick disclosures.
    


            An economist close to large institutional investors said that Lutnick has long been seen negatively by much of Wall Street thanks to his push for Trump to embrace tariffs, and that the markets might even react positively if he left the administration.
    


            “When a trade goes bad, you cut your losses and move on,” the economist said.
    


            But one Wall Street executive told CNN that Lutnick has become a key part of the business side of the Trump administration, so investors might get concerned if he were pushed out.
    


            “He's grown on investors,” the executive said. “Lutnick being on the outs would cause nerves.”

As Gavin Newsom departs, ultra-wealthy flex wealth and influence to fight regulation and keep the boom going

Tech billionaires are leveraging tens of millions of dollars to influence California politics in a marked uptick from their previous participation in affairs at the state capitol. Behemoths such as Google and Meta are getting involved in campaigns for November's elections, as are venture capitalists, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs and Palantir's co-founders. The industry's goals run the gamut – from fighting a billionaire tax to supporting a techie gubernatorial candidate to firing up new, influential super political action committees (Pacs).

The phenomenon squarely fits the moment for the state's politics – with 2026 being the year that Politico has dubbed “the big tech flex”.

Gavin Newsom, California's tech-friendly governor who's been quick to veto legislation that cramps the sector's unfettered growth, is reaching his term limit. That means Silicon Valley needs to find a new ally. The industry may have found its candidate in an upstart mayor from San Jose, Matt Mahan.

Silicon Valley's businesses and billionaires – some of the richest and most powerful on earth, most of which are headquartered in California – are in the midst of a massive AI boom. Industry insiders say tech companies need to ensure they can continue to flourish without regulations getting in the way.

“This is a golden opportunity and a golden moment for tech to reset its priorities and its perceptions,” said David McCuan, a political science professor at Sonoma State University who studies state lobbying.

Rather than going all-in on one candidate or issue, McCuan said the tech sector is using a multi-pronged attack in California. Tech billionaires are contributing to campaigns ranging from candidates for governor to local city council and school board races. They are also donating heavily to groups campaigning for relaxed taxation and minimal regulation around AI.

“If you're an uber-zillionaire, you give money early and often,” McCuan said. “They have more wealth and resources than they've ever had before, so that allows them to play on both sides of the aisle and up and down the ballot and across issues like never before.”

Unlike other industries, such as oil and pharma, tech has been relatively tame when it comes to lobbying in the state. The industry has tended to focus on narrow state issues and instead spent big and broad at the federal level (aside from Uber and Lyft's massive $200m ballot measure campaign in 2020). That ethos has changed. California is now ground zero for tech titans working to become omnipresent in politics.

Robert Singleton, the senior director of policy in California for the tech industry group Chamber of Progress, said this moment has been brewing for a long time and it just needed the right thing to set it off.

“The introduction of that billionaire tax obviously galvanized a lot of wealthy individuals who don't want to see that happen, and who will spend money to make sure it doesn't happen,” Singleton said. “That tipped them into wanting to get more involved.”

The “California Billionaire Tax Act”, often referred to simply as the billionaire tax, is a proposal that would require any California resident worth more than $1bn to pay a one-off, 5% tax on their assets to help cover education, food assistance and healthcare programs in the state. It's sponsored by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, and if it receives enough signatures from California voters, it will go to the ballot in November.

When the proposal was put forward at the end of last year, many among tech's billionaire elite threw a tantrum.

Some opened offices or bought mansions in Florida or Texas, vowing to leave California for good. The fleeing rich included Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel, whose current net worth is $25bn; Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, worth around $255bn and $240bn respectively; and Donald Trump's AI and crypto czar, David Sacks, whose net worth is not publicly known. Earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, worth $229bn, has also bought a property in south Florida valued between $150 and $200m.

Thiel has additionally led the charge in donating to a lobbying group, the California Business Roundtable, which has pledged to fight the wealth tax. The Palantir co-founder handed over $3m to the political action committee in late December. Other major donors include realtors, entrepreneurs and private equity firms. James Siminoff, who founded the camera-embedded Ring doorbell company, also donated $100,000, according to public records.

“The most powerful money in politics is to be on the no-side of a ballot measure,” said McCuan. “You can even pre-empt something getting to the ballot, like a billionaire's tax, by explaining to everyone out there that this is a bad idea for economic growth.”

Tech investors and venture capitalists have been extremely vocal in their opposition to the tax, saying that the state will lose revenue as billionaires flee and it will hurt the state's ability to be economically competitive.

Just this week, Chamath Palihapitiya, a former Facebook executive and current venture capital investor, wrote “the loss of this tax revenue was totally avoidable but is now forever”. Balaji Srinivasan, an investor and former chief technology officer of Coinbase, wrote, “the most successful tech founders of all time have now exited the failed state of California”.

Adding on, Paul Graham, the co-founder of seed capital firm Y Combinator, wrote: “It's important that people like Zuck and Larry Page are willing to move in response to the proposed wealth tax. It shows politicians what will happen if they try things like this.”

Joining the billionaires, Newsom has pledged to fight the tax, saying it will “drive a race to the bottom” and stifle innovation as the ultra-wealthy leave. “This will be defeated – there's no question in my mind,” Newsom told the New York Times in January. “I'll do what I have to do to protect the state.”

Outcry over taxes is just one of the ways the tech sector is ramping up its influence campaign. Several Super Pacs have popped up over the past few months and tech is injecting these committees with tens of millions.

McCuan said this strategy is helpful for the ultra-wealthy because it allows them to stay behind the scenes, while donating limitless money.

“You could create some amorphous sounding organization like ‘Californians for All That is Good and Right Under the Sun',” McCuan said. “And who knows what the hell that is, but that entity becomes the vehicle to which others give money … and it becomes very difficult to unpeel and unfurl what is going on.”

Meta launched two new Super Pacs last fall, which are focused on dialing back AI regulation and supporting AI-friendly candidates. The company contributed $45m to one, the American Technology Excellence Project, which will operate in several states but hasn't yet established a committee in California. The other, Mobilizing Economic Transformation Across (Meta) California, is state-specific and has received one $20m contribution from Meta.

The social media giant has also matched Google in infusing a separate Super Pac called California Leads with a total of $10m. Ron Conway, a longtime Democratic tech donor, has also donated $100,000 to this committee, which says it aims to support favorable candidates in the state but will not just focus on issues affecting the tech industry, according to Politico.

The crypto industry is getting into Super Pacs too, debuting a group called Grow California. The committee opened with $10m from crypto executive Chris Larsen and evangelist Tim Draper. Larsen told the New York Times he plans to give $30m more. The focus of Grow California is to “rebuild a state capital” and shape the state's legislature.

“We have a group of people who are not acting in a pragmatic way. They're not looking for balance. They're completely fucking owned by one side,” Larsen, who's the chair of crypto company Ripple, told Politico. “So we're going to work on taking out those people who are not working for the people of California.”

While the tech industry is now pushing its influence at the state level, San Francisco has already experienced many of these same tactics at the city level. Backed with Silicon Valley money, several different 501(c)(4) groups formed over the past couple election cycles to throw support behind preferred mayoral and board of supervisor candidates. They also bankrolled successful recall campaigns for a progressive district attorney and members of the school board.

The California governor's race has been a crowded field without notable frontrunners. Newsom had been a long-time friend of the tech industry, hosting Google's Page and Brin as guests at his wedding and referring to Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff as “family”. His departure appears to have Silicon Valley fretting.

Singleton, from the Chamber of Progress, said Newsom had long recognized “how pivotal the technology industry is in California”.

But then, late last month, Mahan, a moderate Democrat and the mayor of San Jose, announced his candidacy. Before Mahan got involved in politics in 2020, he had a career in the tech sector. He was an undergraduate at Harvard with Zuckerberg, and in 2014 co-founded a startup with funding from Conway, Benioff and Napster co-founder Sean Parker.

Mahan appears to be the savior the tech industry had been searching for. Since his candidacy announcement just two weeks ago, millions have poured into his campaign. According to public records, he's received donations from several venture capitalists, along with Roblox CEO David Baszucki, Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan, GitHub co-founder Chris Wanstrath, Cloudkitchen co-founder Diego Berdakin, and Ring founder Siminoff.

Mahan has even courted donors who helped launch companies known for working with the Trump administration, including Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale and Anduril co-founder Matt Grimm and his wife Kimberly Grimm, according to public records.

Google's Brin has also backed Mahan, maxing out the limit for an individual campaign donation at $78,400. Several of Mahan's other tech backers also maxed out their donations. At this point, Mahan has now raised more than double the two most prominent democrats in the race, Eric Swalwell and Katie Porter.

As political races and ballot measure campaigns continue to heat up across California in 2026, tech's influence is only expected to grow.

“It's going to be a fun session,” Singleton said. That's for sure.”

Critics accuse administration of ‘cooking the books' by claiming US would save $1.3tn from climate finding reversal

The Trump administration claims its latest move to gut climate regulations and end all greenhouse gas standards for vehicles will save Americans money. But its own analysis indicates that the new rule will push up gas prices, and that the benefits of the rollback are unlikely to outweigh the costs.

On Thursday, the president and his environmental secretary Lee Zeldin announced the finalized repeal of the endangerment finding, a legal determination which underpins virtually all federal climate regulations. He claimed the rollback would save the US $1.3tn by 2055.

Late on Thursday night, EPA published a regulatory impact analysis to back up that number. The savings will come from two places, the document says: some $1.1tn will stem from reduced vehicle prices, while another $200bn will come from slashed electric vehicle purchases and lowered spending on charging infrastructure.

But a chart within the analysis indicates that the US will through 2055 incur $1.4tn in additional costs from increased fuel purchases, vehicle repair and maintenance, insurance, traffic congestion and noise. An additional $40bn in costs will come from reduced energy security, increased refueling time and lowered “drive value”, or costs associated with operating a vehicle.

In total, this means the repeal of the endangerment finding will impose an estimated costs of $1.5tn, overshadowing the projected $1.3tn in savings. And that's before you take into account the huge social and climate costs.

“Their own analysis shows that the costs outweigh the benefits,” said Kathy Harris, who leads clean vehicle programming at the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

In an emailed statement, an EPA spokesperson said: “The Trump EPA is following the law, ending the bogus overreach of previous administrations done by agenda-driven climate zealots.”

In a scenario which assumes severely lowered fuel prices, the benefits of the repeal would outweigh the costs, the analysis says.

That low fuel price case is based on report from the Energy Information Administration (EIA). It was included in the document to properly account for the other “policies being implemented by President Trump that are intended to drive down the price of gasoline”, the authors write.

But that imagined circumstance is “not really realistic”, said Harris.

“That EIA's low oil price [scenario] was never meant to show the effect of any policies that Trump would implement,” she said. “It's designed to showcase the uncertainty and the volatility of domestic oil prices due to international forces on the global oil market that drives gas prices in the US and abroad.

The EPA also fails to provides evidence to support the claim that Trump's policy will “or even could” drive down fuel prices to the extent envisioned in that scenario, Harris said.

“They're cooking the books here,” she added.

Trump has repeatedly pledged to lower gasoline prices for Americans. But when the analysis compares a case study in which vehicle regulations continue, versus one where they are repealed, it does not appear that promise will be met.

Eliminating the greenhouse gas standards, the regulatory impact analysis shows, will increase gasoline prices by some 75 cents per gallon by 2050.

“That's about a 29% increase in gasoline prices compared to if we maintain the policies that are in place,” said Harris.

The administration's analysis also fails to examine the additional costs that deregulation could create due to increased global warming, which experts say could be massive.

“This is aligned with what we've been seeing from this administration, where they focus on the cost to industry while completely ignoring the costs to the health and climate costs,” said Harris.

Repealing the endangerment finding could increase the country's greenhouse gas emissions by a stunning 10% by 2055, and impose up to $4.7tn in additional expenses tied to harmful climate and air pollution by that time, according to projections from advocacy group Environmental Defense Fund.

Critics say the repeal will benefit Trump's wealthy oil-boss donors while harming the working class and vulnerable Americans.

‘Like most actions within this administration, this decision lacks any regard for everyday people and seems to be a play to deepen its loyalty to fossil fuel companies and billionaires who have proven that they are willing to take actions that endanger human life,” said Abre' Conner, director of climate and environmental justice at the NAACP.

The EPA spokesperson said: “These activists picked winners and losers and regulated our economy to the tune of trillions at the expense of the American people with zero measurable environmental impact to show for it. The people who expressing outrage now are simply upset that their preferred ideology can no longer bypass Congress and the will of the people to dictate how Americans live, work, and drive.”

The person did not address questions about the agency's economic analysis.

 The subheading of this article was amended on 15 February 2026 to refer to a figure of $1.3tn rather than $1.3bn.

            As Hakeem Jeffries sits in the minority of a GOP-controlled Washington, he is still haunted by a Republican gerrymandering gambit that he believes cost him the speaker's gavel — and cost his party control of the House.
    


            This time, he's making sure Democrats fight back.
    


            Jeffries is leading the Democratic party's counterpunch to President Donald Trump's aggressive mid-decade redistricting push. He's going all in with money, legal firepower and his own political capital to make sure no seat is left on the table for Democrats — forcing the party to abandon the left's longtime moral opposition to party-line map meddling.
    


            “Republicans started this redistricting war, and Democrats have made clear, we're going to finish it,” Jeffries said in an interview with CNN. “When they go low, we strike back.”
    


            Top Democrats, including Jeffries, are buoyed by signs of surging anti-Trump sentiment across the country — with special election wins even in ruby red parts of Texas — and believe they will capture the House, and possibly the Senate, in November. But Jeffries believes he can't afford to ignore the GOP's gerrymandering, when just three seats in North Carolina in 2024 were enough to cost Democrats the majority.
    


            After a huge win on redistricting in California, Jeffries is vowing to spend “tens of millions” of dollars to push through an April ballot initiative in Virginia to potentially give Democrats four more seats. And he is now turning his attention to Maryland, where Democrats' big gerrymandering gamble is facing its most difficult test yet. Jeffries and other top Democrats are now intensifying pressure on a key party leader, the 42-year-old Baltimorean who runs the state Senate, who refuses to help draw his party another more favorable seat that would target the state's lone GOP-held congressional district.
    


            Jeffries issued a stark warning to that Democrat, state Senate President Bill Ferguson — suggesting the move could help Trump's GOP win the midterms.
    


            “One man shouldn't stand in the way of the people of Maryland … being able to decide, ‘Should we go in this direction? Or should we not answer Donald Trump's continued efforts to rig the midterm election?'” Jeffries said.
    


            If Ferguson doesn't back down, Jeffries vowed to personally apply the pressure: “At some point I'm going to have a conversation with him if he continues to stand in the way of an up-or-down vote.” CNN has reached out to Ferguson for comment.
    


            The prevailing sentiment in the Maryland Senate Democratic Caucus, however, is one of skepticism. They insist a new map at this point would only backfire on Democrats.
    


            “It's not a question of one man, but a caucus that measures the risk calculation differently given recent past experience,” a person close to the Maryland Senate Democratic Caucus told CNN.
    


            While the caucus agreed with Jeffries that fighting Trump should the top goal, this person added: “Unfortunately, mid-cycle redistricting in Maryland would have the opposite impact and likely backfire in the state courts, giving Trump and the GOP even more seats in Congress.”
    


            Top Democrats, including Jeffries, never expected a mid-decade redistricting push to be the centerpiece of their midterms strategy. It's expensive and legally fraught with plenty of political pitfalls. Already, Jeffries and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker struggled to find support for a mid-decade map redraw in blue Illinois. (With early voting already underway in Illinois, Jeffries' allies insist the state could still be muscled to act, if necessary, such as if the Supreme Court strikes down part of the Voting Rights Act and creates what one Democratic operative called “a worst-case-scenario” for the party.)
    


            Democrats say they were dragged into the redistricting fight by Trump and the GOP, who kicked off the redistricting arms race last year in Texas. Now, as many Democrats see it, it's the new future of House campaigning.
    


            Jeffries and his team are already looking ahead to states like Washington, Colorado and even Pennsylvania for the 2028 cycle, according to multiple people familiar with party strategy. In their minds, it's not just the path to the House majority this year, it's the way to hold onto it.
    


            “(Trump) wanted to rig the midterm elections, and for whatever the reason, didn't think that Democrats were going to forcefully respond. He got that wrong,” Jeffries said.
    


            Just months after the GOP's Texas effort, Democrats believe they are on track to gain as many as five seats in California, one in Utah and several in Virginia — moves that could nearly neutralize the GOP's own gerrymandering push. Another seat could be coming in New York if a court challenge goes their way.
    


            Republicans, meanwhile, have enacted new congressional maps in four states, targeting nine House seats held by Democrats. (One seat in Missouri, though, is still tied up in courts.) A big push in Florida is still to come.
    


            Jeffries, though, believes it could end up as a wash.
    


            “The best-case scenario for Republicans at this point is status quo, which is very different than what they were claiming when they were beating on their chest last year, saying they were going to gerrymander our opportunities out of existence,” Jeffries said.
    


            Both parties are closely watching another big state fight: Virginia.
    


            Newly elected Gov. Abigail Spanberger and state Democrats are pursuing a strategy so aggressive that it's surprised even some Democrats in Washington. They are looking to eliminate as many as four GOP seats, transforming their House delegation — which has six Democrats and five Republicans — into one with 10 Democrats and just one Republican.
    


            That's all in a state where Kamala Harris won by about 6 points.
    


            Jeffries told CNN he is willing to devote “tens of millions of dollars” to make sure Democrats are successful on the ballot in April. (House Majority Forward, a group linked to Jeffries, committed $5 million last week, and it is expected to spend more before April, the group told CNN.)
    


            Democrats are much more anxious about neighboring Maryland, where Jeffries and others are ratcheting up pressure on the state Senate president to yield in time.
    


            It may not be enough. Ferguson and others in the caucus are insisting there is no path forward, both publicly and privately, according to interviews with a half-dozen people closely tracking the state's push.
    


            “At the end of the day, if he won't bring it to a vote, there's not much you can do about that,” Rep. Glenn Ivey, a Maryland Democrat, told CNN.
    


            Ivey said he personally wouldn't have chosen this path if Trump hadn't forced Democrats' hand, adding: “It's an awful game.”
    


            But Ivey, like many others, is deeply anxious about what could happen if blue-leaning Maryland ignores what GOP leaders in Texas, Florida, North Carolina and other states are doing.
    


            “We better not lose the House by one seat,” Ivey said.
    


            Ferguson and other skeptics believe a new Democratic map in Maryland would not survive the courts and could ultimately backfire. Andy Harris, the GOP lawmaker who stands to lose the seat if Democrats redraw the maps, predicted that Republicans could actually gain a seat if Democrats moved forward — with a court forcing them to redraw in favor of the GOP.
    


            “We'll get a second seat. That's why the Senate president doesn't want to do it,” Harris said in an interview with CNN.
    


            But Jeffries was blunt when asked about a new map backfiring on Democrats: “That's not going to happen.”
    


            Top Democrats believe they can still win back the House even without that single additional seat in Maryland. But they don't want to take the gamble.
    


            Asked if Ferguson's move could cost Democrats a possible majority, Jeffries said: “Well, he'd have to live with that.”

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

Former Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko was detained while attempting to cross the border, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) said on Feb. 15.

"Today, while crossing the border, NABU detectives detained a former energy minister as part of the Midas case," the bureau said.

Halushchenko is under investigation by NABU in connection with the broader Energoatom corruption case, considered the largest anti-corruption case during President Volodymyr Zelensky's presidency. Eight suspects have been formally charged. 

Halushchenko was removed from a train, Ukrainska Pravda reported, citing a source.

Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty's investigative project Schemes reported that he had been detained under Article 208 of Ukraine's Criminal Procedure Code, which allows authorized officers to detain a suspect without a court warrant.

According to Schemes, Halushchenko is being transported to Kyiv for further questioning and investigative procedures. 

Border guards had reportedly received instructions from NABU and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO) to alert authorities if he attempted to leave the country.

Halushchenko served as energy minister from 2021 to 2025 and was appointed justice minister in July 2025. On Nov. 10, NABU searched properties linked to him as part of the Energoatom investigation.

During court hearings in November, anti-corruption prosecutors cited audio recordings obtained by investigators. In the recordings, suspects allegedly discuss dividing kickbacks and refer to a figure nicknamed "Professor," whom prosecutors believe to be Halushchenko.

Ukraine's parliament approved Halushchenko's resignation on Nov. 19 after President Zelensky publicly urged him to step down. The investigation is ongoing.

Before joining the Kyiv Independent, she worked as a freelance journalist with a focus on cultural narratives and human stories. Tania holds a B.A. in publishing and editing from Borys Hrinchenko Kyiv University.



 In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, the Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur examines how Ukraine appears in recently released Jeffrey Epstein files. The files reference flight arrangements for models linked to Kyiv agencies, a failed real estate deal in Lviv, and brief mentions of Ukraine's 2019 presidential election. 

Former Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko was detained while attempting to cross the state border, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) said on Feb. 15.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said Feb. 15 that Russia launched around 1,300 drones, more than 1,200 guided bombs, and 50 mostly ballistic missiles at Ukraine over the past week, targeting energy infrastructure and residential areas.


Russia has lost around 1,253,270 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported on Feb. 15, 2026.

Ukraine carried out strikes on an oil terminal in southern Russia and a Russian air defense system in Crimea overnight on Feb. 14–15, according to Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR).

The Alpha unit of Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) destroyed half of Russia's stockpile of the coveted Pantsir air defense system, the SBU announced Feb. 14.

"There were three attacks on the energy infrastructure of Azerbaijan in Ukraine, and there were also three attacks on the Azerbaijani embassy in Ukraine," Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev told the independent outlet Ukrainska Pravda.

Zelensky and Rubio discussed supporting Ukraine with air defense missiles during the winter and the possibility of future talks with the presidents of Ukraine, the U.S., and Russia to "resolve the most problematic issues." 

"The U.K., Sweden, France, Germany, and the Netherlands are confident that Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a lethal toxin," the countries' governments said in a joint statement. "Navalny died while held in prison, meaning Russia had the means, motive and opportunity to administer this poison to him." 

"It would be an illusion to believe that this war can now be reliably ended by dividing Ukraine – just as it was an illusion to believe that sacrificing Czechoslovakia would save Europe from a greater war," Zelensky said at the Munich Security Conference. 



"(W)e have to find a solution to bridge the gap between the current methodology and the geopolitical challenges. We cannot wait any longer," European Commissioner for Enlargement Marta Kos said. 

According to Svyrydenko, the program will be considered at the next meeting of the IMF Executive Board, while there has been "much discussion about how this will be done."

The General Staff reported that Russia's BK-16 landing vessel, a high-speed landing craft for coastal operations and troop transport, was "successfully hit" on Feb. 12 in Russian-occupied Crimea.

Mohan Karki – one of many people ICE has deported to countries with which they have little connection – leaves behind his wife and seven-month-old baby he has yet to hold

Tika Basnet sat facing the glow of her iPhone, a red tika pressed into the center of her forehead. Seven-month-old Briana slept on her lap, her breathing soft and uneven. On the other side of the screen was Mohan Karki, Basnet's husband, who had yet to hold his daughter.

For Karki, nearly 9,000 miles (14,500km) away, it was already morning. He was in hiding in south Asia, his exact location withheld for his safety, his face breaking into pixels as he watched his daughter sleep.

“I feel like a ghost,” Karki said in Nepali. “Living in the shadows. No home, no name, not even an identity card that says I belong anywhere.”

Karki, 30, was deported to Bhutan on 13 January, after more than nine months in detention and a series of legal battles led by his wife and his attorneys in a final effort to stop his removal. Although Karki is stateless, his parents are Bhutanese, a distinction that has little bearing on his lived reality. He has never lived in Bhutan; he was born in a refugee camp in Nepal, and returning there exposes him to the risk of persecution and renewed statelessness.

Human rights advocates say this case reflects a broader and troubling pattern under the Trump administration, which has increasingly deported people – including refugees – to countries with which they have little or no connection, often placing their lives in danger. For years, Bhutan had refused to repatriate Bhutanese refugees, and no public repatriation agreement between the two countries exists, according to Aisa Villarosa, an attorney with the Asian Law Caucus, also involved in ongoing Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) litigation tied to the removal of Bhutanese refugees.

“When you see a sudden shift in removal practices like this, it usually signals that some kind of government-to-government understanding exists,” Villarosa said. “What we're trying to learn is what that understanding looks like.”

John Sifton, Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, said Bhutan was not a country where deported refugees can legally remain. Recent reports from the organization describe ongoing human rights violations against Nepali-speaking political prisoners, documenting conditions it called dire and alleging that detainees continue to face torture and denial of fair trials.

“It's not safe to be a stateless person,” Sifton said. Refugees sent back to Bhutan are often pushed across the Indian border within days, leaving them stranded without nationality. “That is an inherently risky and dangerous status to have.”

Sifton continued: “The idea that the US government would now say the place they were expelled from is safe contradicts two decades of US policy.”

An advocacy group estimates that at least 70 Bhutanese refugees have effectively vanished into statelessness, some now in hiding, others stranded in legal limbo after being sent to a country that does not recognize them as citizens.

Four days after delivering her baby, Basnet traveled from their home in a suburb of Columbus, Ohio, to Detroit, where Karki was held in detention. She spoke with lawyers between feedings and appeared at Nepali community gatherings and on podcasts and Facebook livestreams to ask for help in broken English.

“Motherhood and crisis,” she said, “arrived at the same moment, and neither waited.”

For Basnet, the deportation of her husband feels both personal and historical. “He doesn't have a home there,” she said of Bhutan. “He doesn't have family. He doesn't speak the language. It feels like the history of expulsion is repeating itself, and no one seems to realize it.”

That history for Basnet and Karki traces back to the early 1990s, when more than 100,000 ethnic Nepali-speaking Bhutanese were forced out of the country during a state-led campaign that stripped them of citizenship and property.

“What we are seeing now in the United States is not new for many Nepali-speaking Bhutanese,” said Robin Gurung, co-executive director of Asian Refugees United, an advocacy organization supporting deported Bhutanese refugees. “Back then, the government decided who was worthy of citizenship based solely on ethnicity.”

Both Karki's and Basnet's families eventually resettled in refugee camps in eastern Nepal, where tens of thousands of displaced Bhutanese lived for decades. “Life in the camp was depressing,” Karki said. “We didn't have enough food. We didn't feel safe.” Even there, he said, he found small ways to hold onto childhood: “I loved playing soccer with my friends. That made me happy.”

In early 2008, under the George W Bush administration, the US began a large-scale resettlement program for Bhutanese refugees. By the end of Barack Obama's second term, more than 85,000 Bhutanese refugees had been resettled in the US, including both Karki's and Basnet's families. Karki's family arrived in Georgia in 2011. That same year, Basnet's family resettled in Ohio.

“What I liked about Georgia, about America, was the abundance,” Karki said. “I convinced my father that once I finished high school, I wanted to join the US army, to give back to this country, and my father was OK with that decision.”

That dream unraveled less than two years after his arrival. In February 2013, Karki, who was 17 then, and two friends were arrested in Georgia and charged with burglary, criminal trespassing and interference with government property.

Karki has disputed the intent behind the incident.

“We were just trying to get home quickly after school,” he said. “One of my friends said we could jump the fence as a shortcut. We didn't know you could get in trouble for walking onto someone else's property.”

According to court transcripts reviewed by the Guardian, prosecutors alleged that jewelry was taken from the residence. The case did not go to trial, and no witness testified to seeing a burglary or theft. The only eyewitness account referenced involved someone who reported seeing individuals jump a fence.

Karki said he accepted a plea deal. “My lawyer told me if I agreed to the plea, I could go home that day,” he said. “If I didn't, I might stay in prison for 25 years.”

Brian Hoffman, Karki's immigration attorney, said the exchange reflected a common failure at the intersection of criminal and immigration law. “If your own lawyer is telling you, ‘This is a good deal, you should plead guilty,' you're not really listening to warnings about immigration consequences,” Hoffman said.

Cases like Karki's, Hoffman added, reveal the brutal mechanics of the system. Crimes that may be minor under state law can be reclassified as “aggravated felonies” for immigration purposes, triggering mandatory detention and deportation. “It doesn't make any objective sense,” Hoffman said. “But that's the system.”

In August 2014, an immigration judge ordered Karki's removal from the US. He was detained for about a month, then released under supervision after neither Bhutan nor Nepal accepted him. According to court documents reviewed by the Guardian and reporting from NPR, Karki was then released under an order of supervision, a status that allowed him to remain in the US under regular monitoring by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Karki maintained regular ICE check-ins, earned his GED and worked at a meat-processing plant in Georgia. In 2021, while visiting family near Columbus, he met Basnet at a local gym.

They exchanged smiles and left without speaking. Later that evening, Basnet received a Facebook message from him. Their community, she explained, was small and tightly connected. A mutual friend had told Karki who she was.

Late-night phone calls followed. They traded voice notes, TikTok videos and long conversations that stretched past midnight. Within a year, Karki moved to Ohio to be closer to her and his family.

Her parents initially opposed the relationship, worried about Karki's immigration status, his education and his unstable employment. “They wanted me to marry someone with higher education, someone with a steady job,” Basnet said.

Karki was required to report regularly to immigration authorities to renew his work authorization, a process that often left him in limbo. Delays in paperwork made steady employment difficult. “I couldn't keep a stable job,” he said. “Sometimes they delayed my permit.” He was eventually able to get his license to drive a commercial truck.

The couple eloped in December 2023.

“I knew it wouldn't be easy for us,” Basnet said. “I knew I might have to carry a lot on my own. But I couldn't love anyone else. He loved me deeply, and I knew he would make me happy for the rest of my life.”

Asked whether she ever feared his deportation, Basnet said she believed the risk had passed years earlier. “We knew they tried to deport him in 2014, and neither Bhutan nor Nepal accepted him,” she said. “He was born in a refugee camp. He had nowhere else to go. I felt confident they wouldn't deport him.”

“He followed every rule,” Basnet said. “I thought he was safe.”

The sense of safety Karki and Basnet had built was short-lived. After Trump won the 2024 election on a promise of mass deportation, reports began circulating that Bhutanese refugees were being picked up as ICE expanded enforcement in immigrant communities across the country.

Only months earlier, the couple had been planning a future. They had saved nearly $20,000 for a down payment on a home. “We wanted a small place of our own,” Basnet said. “A room for our future kids.” Within days, everything changed.

On 2 April 2025, the couple drove to what they believed would be a routine ICE check-in. When they arrived, an agent told Karki to return on 8 April instead. “I knew something was off,” Basnet said.

“We hired an attorney that morning,” Basnet said. “Our friends told us that sometimes bringing a lawyer can stop ICE from detaining you.”

It didn't.

“When we walked in, they called my husband's name,” Basnet said. “Before he could even step forward, agents grabbed him and handcuffed him.”

Basnet and his attorney were ordered to wait outside. Minutes later, an agent returned and told them Karki would be transferred to the Butler county detention center and processed for deportation to Bhutan.

“I told them immediately he's not from Bhutan,” Basnet said. “If he's deported there, he's not safe.” The agent responded that the decision came from higher authorities and that travel documents had already been issued by Bhutan.

Travel documents reviewed by the Guardian show that Bhutan has accepted deportees only as “non-Bhutanese”, a designation that does not guarantee residency rights or legal status inside the country. (The Guardian sought comment from Bhutan's UN ambassador on the deportation agreement and travel documents, but received no response.)

In a statement, the UN refugee agency said deported Bhutanese refugees remained legally stateless because Bhutan did not recognize them as citizens and no other country claimed them as nationals. Returning stateless people to a country that refuses to recognize them creates a precarious situation, the agency warned. When asked whether it had communicated those concerns directly to the Trump administration, the agency declined to comment. (The Department of Homeland Security and ICE have not responded to requests for comment.)

Karki was transferred to St Clair county jail in Detroit on 9 June 2025, as his family, attorneys and advocates fought for his release. “They treated us worse than animals,” Karki said. He said he requested to see an eye doctor because he had a prescription for glasses: “I asked the ICE nurse. They told me they would arrange it, but it never happened.”

He also described harassment from other people incarcerated there. “People in jail targeted those of us detained for immigration,” he said. “They called us ‘illegal' and all kinds of things.”

After more than six months of legal challenges, including a habeas petition denied in December, he was deported to Bhutan on 13 January – placed on a commercial flight to Newark, then to New Delhi. Villarosa said many Bhutanese refugees were being deported on commercial flights in what she described as a covert process that makes it “next to impossible” to track how many people have been removed. The Guardian reached out to Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, involved in the flights, for comment regarding concerns raised by human rights groups. Neither airline responded by publication time.

When Karki landed in India, he said, local authorities escorted him through the airport. The next day, he was placed on a flight to Bhutan.

“I had no documents with me,” Karki said. “No ID to prove who I was.”

When Karki's plane landed in Paro, he said, the weight of that history finally caught up with him.

“That's when it felt real,” he said. “I grew up hearing stories of torture from my family and elders. When I stepped onto that ground, I thought I was going to die.” He said Bhutanese officials gave him two options on arrival: prison, or a taxi to the Indian border.

He remains stateless, like many of the refugees deported before him.

Each day, he calls Basnet. They talk. They cry. Sometimes they laugh. She continues to campaign for his return while raising their daughter alone. Basnet works full-time and often takes extra shifts while she organizes, calls lawyers and speaks at community events.

“I work as much as I can,” she said. “Sometimes I leave my daughter with family and friends so I can keep fighting this.”

Asked whether she is exhausted, Basnet shook her head.

“I'm fighting for my family,” she said. “For my husband. For the future of my daughter that's being stolen by the government.”

Japan's Toshikazu Yamanishi set a men's half marathon race walk world record on Sunday, clocking 1:20:34 at the Japanese Half Marathon Race Walking Championships in Kobe.

His time bettered the inaugural world record of 1:21:30, approved by the World Athletics Council in December last year, by 54 seconds.

Yamanishi, who was celebrating his 30th birthday, pulled away from a leading pack shortly after the 17-kilometer mark and reached 20-kilometer mark in 1:16:26 – just 16 seconds shy of the 20-kilometer race walk world record he set on the same course last year.

With an additional lap now included in the half marathon race walk distance, the two‑time world champion accelerated again over the closing stretch to win comfortably in record time.

World Athletics approved inaugural world record standards for the half marathon and marathon race walking events. The approved inaugural world record standard for the men's half marathon race walk was set at 1:21:30.

LONDON — The latest issue of the British magazine The Economist features an article on Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi titled, “The world's most powerful woman.”

In light of her landslide victory in the House of Representatives election earlier this month, the article said that Takaichi “now has a historic chance to transform her country,” and that “she must be a leader for all of Japan, not only for her right-wing loyalists.”

The magazine features an illustration of Takaichi waving with Mt. Fuji in the background.

The article describes Takaichi's moves to strengthen Japan's defense capabilities and praises her measures to revitalize the defense industry.

The magazine also said Takaichi did an “admirable job” regarding the relationship she has built with U.S. President Donald Trump and urged her to “also recognise that her country has a crucial role to play as a stabilising force in a turbulent world.”

However, it warned against using her vast support to pursue narrow ideological goals, and said, Takaichi “needs to think bigger and broader.”

MOSCOW, February 15. /TASS/. The idea of introducing external governance in Ukraine under the auspices of the United Nations following the completion of the special military operation is one of the possible options for resolving the conflict, and Russia is prepared to discuss it with other countries, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin said in an interview with TASS.

"The idea of introducing external governance in Ukraine under the auspices of the UN after the completion of the special military operation is not new. In March 2025, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that, in the case of Ukraine, the establishment of an external administration under the auspices of the UN is one of the possible options. Such precedents have occurred within the framework of the world organization's peacekeeping activities. In general, Russia is ready to discuss with the United States, European and other countries the possibility of introducing temporary external governance in Kiev," he said.

The Russian deputy foreign minister believes that such a step "would make it possible to hold democratic elections in Ukraine, bring to power a capable government with which a full-fledged peace treaty could be signed, along with legitimate documents on future interstate cooperation."

"At the same time," the senior diplomat continued, "it should be taken into account that the United Nations does not formally have a standardized mechanism for establishing temporary international administrations in territories affected by conflict."

The Associated Press

10:31 JST, February 15, 2026

MUNICH (AP) — About 250,000 people demonstrated on Saturday against Iran's government on the sidelines of a gathering of world leaders in Germany, police said, answering a call from Iran ‘s exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi for cranked-up international pressure on Tehran.

Banging drums and chanting for regime change, the giant and boisterous rally in Munich was part of what Pahlavi described as a “global day of action” to support Iranians in the wake of deadly nationwide protests. He also called for demonstrations in Los Angeles and Toronto. Police said in a post on X that the number of protesters reached some 250,000, more than the organizers had expected.

“Change, change, regime change” the huge crowd chanted, waving green-white-and-red flags with lion and sun emblems. Iran used that flag before its 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled the Pahlavi dynasty.

At a news conference, Pahlavi warned of more deaths in Iran if “democracies stand by and watch” following Iran's deadly crackdown on protesters last month.

“We gather at an hour of profound peril to ask: Will the world stand with the people of Iran?” he asked. He added that the survival of Iran's government “sends a clear signal to every bully: kill enough people and you stay in power.”

An estimated 350,000 people marched on the streets of Toronto as part of the Global Day of Action Rally, Toronto Police spokesperson Laura Brabant said.

At the Munich rally, demonstrators sported “Make Iran Great Again” red caps, mimicking the MAGA caps worn by U.S. President Donald Trump ‘s supporters. Among those sporting the caps was U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who gave a speech to the crowd during which he was photographed holding up the headwear.

Many at the rally waved placards showing Pahlavi, some that called him a king. The son of Iran's deposed shah has been in exile for nearly 50 years but is trying to position himself as a player in Iran's future.

The crowd chanted “Pahlavi for Iran,” and “democracy for Iran” as drums and cymbals sounded.

“We have huge hopes and (are) looking forward that the regime is going to change hopefully,” said Daniyal Mohtashamian, a demonstrator who traveled from Zurich, in Switzerland, to speak for protesters inside Iran who faced repression.

“There is an internet blackout, and their voices are not going outside of Iran,” he said.

About 500 protesters also rallied outside the presidential palace in Nicosia, Cyprus, with many holding up banners with slogans against Iran's government and in favor of Pahlavi.

The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency says at least 7,005 people were killed in last month's protests, including 214 government forces. It has been accurate in counting deaths during previous rounds of unrest in Iran and relies on a network of activists inside Iran to verify deaths.

Iran's government offered its only death toll on Jan. 21, saying 3,117 people were killed. Iran's theocracy in the past has undercounted or not reported fatalities from past unrest.

The Associated Press has been unable to independently assess the death toll, given authorities have disrupted internet access and international calls in Iran.

Iranian leaders are facing renewed pressure from Trump, who has threatened U.S. military action. Trump wants Iran to further scale back its nuclear program. He suggested Friday that regime change in Iran “would be the best thing that could happen.”

Iran was also the focus of protests in Munich on Friday, the opening day of an annual security conference in the city gathering European leaders and global security figures. Supporters of the Iranian opposition group People's Mujahedeen Organization of Iran, also known as the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, demonstrated.

Controversial Olympic athlete Eileen Gu called out the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS) over the tight Olympic schedule she has, which she said will prevent her from getting in the proper training sessions she needs for a freeski event.

Gu, who is representing China during the 2026 Winter Olympics, made her thoughts known after she clinched a spot in the big air final, which takes place Monday. She said competing in the final will take her away from properly practicing for the qualifying round of the halfpipe final, which takes place on Thursday.

"I'm disappointed in FIS," she said. "I think the Olympics should epitomize aspiration, and I think being able to do something that's beyond the ordinary should be celebrated instead of punished."

Gu said she wasn't trying to get special treatment, only the same amount of practice time as her competitors. She said she tried to compromise, including joining the snowboarders' training on the halfpipe. She said the FIS told her it couldn't make the change because it wouldn't be fair to the other competitors.

Gu already won silver in slopestyle earlier this week.

"I think it's really unfair. I think it's punishing excellence, to be completely honest with you," Gu added. "Because I dare to do three events, and this is making it completely impossible to train fairly for the third event."

FIS scheduled three training sessions before qualifying – an increase from two for a typical World Cup event. The organization's spokesman, Bruno Sassi, said, "Every effort has been made to facilitate the best possible training" for the athletes.

"But as we have already seen at these Games, for athletes who choose to compete in multiple disciplines and/or multiple events, conflicts can sometimes be inevitable," he said.

Gu, who was born in the U.S. but chose to compete for China, hasn't skied in a halfpipe event since December and hasn't competed in big air since winning the gold in the 2022 Beijing Games. The halfpipe event is a bit more dangerous than the other two.

One grape, three vineyards — totally different wines. From slope and sunlight to soil, rainfall and elevation, an Arizona winemaker tells Fox News Digital how terroir transforms identical Syrah into unique expressions.

Eric Glomski still remembers the first time he discovered his "liquid landscape."

"I remember closing my eyes and smelling this wine, and it reminded me exactly of the place where I harvested those apples," he recalled in an interview with Fox News Digital.

Glomski had not been a winemaker at that time. He was a restoration ecologist, hiking the perennial streams of central Arizona, cataloging river systems and abandoned homesteads.

It was there he found heirloom apples growing wild. He hauled them out in a backpack, made apple wine with a mentor and, eight months later, experienced what he calls his epiphany.

"I realized I was having an artistic experience with the landscape that wasn't analytical, and it wasn't scientific," he said.

He dropped out of graduate school, moved to California and volunteered at wineries — sleeping in his truck.

He finally landed a position at the acclaimed David Bruce Winery in the Santa Cruz Mountains.

For nearly six years, Glomski immersed himself in a culture guided by one principle: "What's best for the wine?"

WHAT HAPPENS TO OPENED WINE — AND HOW TO KNOW WHEN IT'S GONE BAD

Glomski said he always intended to return to Arizona.

"I always wanted to come back to Arizona and make wines that expressed Arizona," he said.

In 2003, he founded Page Springs Cellars & Vineyards in the Verde Valley. The region's volcanic soils, limestone deposits and elevation offered what he saw as untapped potential.

Contrary to popular perception, Arizona wine country is not a blistering desert floor, Glomski said.

"My two biggest issues are frost and freeze, and monsoon rains — the exact opposite of what people expect," he said.

His vineyards stretch from 3,500 to 5,500 feet in elevation.

"It snows in my vineyards regularly," he said. "People don't realize this, because Arizona is very mountainous."

"I like to think of myself as an ambassador for Arizona."

That elevation, combined with volcanic, limestone and even granite soils, allows him to grow Rhône varietals that express distinct personalities depending on where they're planted. 

He grows Syrah in multiple estate vineyards, and said the differences are unmistakable.

"They're so distinctive because of these different ecological characters," he said.

For Glomski, that distinctiveness is the point.

"I like to think of myself as an ambassador for Arizona," he said. "I mean, obviously I have my own business, and I'm excited about doing well, but I really believe in Arizona too."

That belief was tested in 2006, when out-of-state distributors introduced legislation that would have prevented small Arizona wineries from selling directly to consumers and retailers.

Glomski and the other small group of winemakers received notice from the Arizona Department of Liquor Licenses and Control ordering them to "cease and desist all direct-to-consumer sales."

Wineries would have been forced to sell exclusively through wholesalers — even buying back their own bottles to pour in tasting rooms, Glomski said.

"It was this very heavy-handed middleman move to control the market," he said.

Working with a volunteer attorney and a handful of fellow winemakers, Glomski spent two months going "door-to-door" at the state Capitol, meeting "every senator and every representative in our state" to help reform the legislation, he said.

"Ultimately, we beat them," Glomski said.

Glomski, left, dropped out of graduate school, went to work for a California vineyard and eventually opened Page Springs Cellars in Arizona. (Page Springs Cellars; Grace Stufkosky)

In the decade that followed, Arizona's winery count grew from eight to more than 100.

"If that isn't case in point about what a difference that made to the ability for a free market and these businesses to grow," Glomski said.

"I think in the next decade-plus, you're going to see Arizona really making some waves."

Today, that growth is finding a national audience. Page Springs' Alma del Suelo red and white wines are featured in the Fox News Wine Shop. 

The wines aim to introduce drinkers to Arizona's emerging identity.

"We knew we wanted it to really speak of Arizona," Glomski said.

He believes the state is still defining itself.

"Arizona is still, I think, figuring that out," he said. "But I don't think it's going to be as limited as that. I think we're going to have regions developed that have really, radically different themes."

If lawmakers continue to modernize regulations and allow investment to flow, he sees enormous potential.

WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. military forces boarded another sanctioned tanker in the Indian Ocean after tracking the vessel from the Caribbean Sea in an effort to target illicit oil connected to Venezuela, the Pentagon said Sunday. 

Venezuela had faced U.S. sanctions on its oil for several years, relying on a shadow fleet of falsely flagged tankers to smuggle crude into global supply chains. President Donald Trump ordered a quarantine of sanctioned tankers in December to pressure then-President Nicolás Maduro before Maduro was apprehended in January during an American military operation. 

Several tankers fled the Venezuelan coast in the wake of the raid, including the ship that was boarded in the Indian Ocean overnight. The Defense Department said in a post on X that U.S. forces boarded the Veronica III, conducting “a right-of-visit, maritime interdiction and boarding.” 

“The vessel tried to defy President Trump's quarantine — hoping to slip away,” the Pentagon said. “We tracked it from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, closed the distance, and shut it down.” 

Video posted by the Pentagon shows U.S. troops boarding the tanker. 

The Veronica III is a Panamanian-flagged vessel under U.S. sanctions related to Iran, according to the website of the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control. 

The Veronica III left Venezuela on Jan. 3, the same day as Maduro's capture, with nearly 2 million barrels of crude and fuel oil, TankerTrackers.com posted Sunday on X.




“Since 2023, she's been involved with Russian, Iranian and Venezuelan oil,” the organization said.

Samir Madani, co-founder of TankerTrackers.com, told The Associated Press in January that his organization used satellite imagery and surface-level photos to document that at least 16 tankers left the Venezuelan coast in contravention of the quarantine. 

The Trump administration has been seizing tankers as part of its broader efforts to take control of the Venezuela's oil. The Pentagon did not say in the post whether the Veronica III was formally seized and placed under U.S. control, and later told the AP in an email that it had no additional information to provide beyond that post.

Last week, the U.S. military boarded a different tanker in the Indian Ocean, the Aquila II. The ship was being held while its ultimate fate was decided by the United States, according to a defense official who spoke last week on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing decision-making.

A student group affiliated with Turning Point USA is facing criticism for hosting an event at a Maryland high school in December, with one woman saying that Child Protective Services had been notified.

A local community member, who was identified as Nancy, expressed "serious concern" about the December TPUSA-affiliated event at a February 12 board meeting. The woman spoke after a student from the high school who serves as president of the Calvert County Club America.

That student said his group placed restrictions on the event after receiving "hate" online, including restricting access for adults they did not know who were not volunteers or parents of attendees. He also stated that all students who attended had parental permission.

"We have been accused of many things. We have been accused of grooming children… an allegation that a random unnamed man was president of our group and had certain felony charges. I'm the president of the group. I'm 17, I'm a minor. I can't groom children because I am a child. I don't have any felony charges or convictions," the student said, adding an invitation to discuss any questions.

The student clarified that CCCA is affiliated with TPUSA but is its own 501(c)(3) organization and is not part of the state's public school system.

Nancy spoke next, raising her issues with the TPUSA event. 

"While community building opportunities for students are important, this event raises serious concerns related to student safety, parental rights and governance oversight," the woman stated, claiming that parents and legal guardians were not permitted to attend the event.

"Excluding parents and guardians from a student-focused event creates a lack of transparency and undermines established best practices for youth safety," she continued, going on to say that such events should be subject to supervision and background checks.

"Students are widely recognized as vulnerable population, they are in critical developmental stages, and especially susceptible to influence," she added.

"All Board of Education members in this room are mandated reporters under state law, as I am. Based on the circumstances surrounding this event, a report was made to Child Protective Services," the woman added as she concluded her remarks.

Controversy over the event comes as TPUSA continues to grow its influence on high school and college campuses across the country since the assassination of the group's founder, Charlie Kirk.

His wife, Erika Kirk, told Fox News' Shannon Bream in December that the organization intends to resume its normal presence on college campuses in particular.

"We are not afraid," she said, adding that the TPUSA team will continue to host "Prove Me Wrong"–style debates as part of its campus outreach.

Charlie Kirk was assassinated during an outdoor event on Sept. 10 at Utah Valley University. The gathering marked the first stop on TPUSA's planned "American Comeback Tour," and at first, nothing appeared out of the ordinary.

Fox News senior White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich has the latest on  the president's response to the January jobs report and economic growth on 'Special Report.'

Recessions and stock market crashes are inevitable in a market-based economy, but few Americans realize that their investments face risks far greater than falling stock prices.

Because of largely unknown legal changes, millions of Americans could temporarily or even permanently lose their retirement and other investment savings in the next major financial crash, all while too-big-to-fail Wall Street firms and banks are protected.

That might sound like a wild conspiracy theory, but the danger is real and well documented.

STEPHEN MOORE: FROM DOW 800 TO 50,000--REAGAN, TRUMP AND THE SUPPLY-SIDE MIRACLE

Beginning in the 1970s, at the request of powerful Wall Street and banking institutions, state lawmakers quietly adopted a series of changes to the Uniform Commercial Code, a body of law enacted in all 50 states. These changes effectively allowed financial institutions to reassign direct ownership of most securities away from individual investors, including those holding retirement accounts and traditional brokerage accounts.

Under the revised legal framework, direct ownership of securities such as stocks and bonds was centralized within a single financial institution controlled by Wall Street's largest firms and banks: the Depository Trust Company, or DTC.

Today, DTC "provides custody and asset servicing for 1.44 million security issues from more than 170 countries and territories valued at more than US $100 trillion as of 2025." To put that figure in perspective, the entire federal budget is roughly $7 trillion.

In January, I released a new book, "The Next Big Crash: Conspiracy, Collapse, and the Men Behind History's Biggest Heist," to explain how this legal framework was constructed, why it poses grave risks to consumers today, and to uncover the remarkable conspiracy behind DTC's creation. The book is the culmination of years of research, and the evidence it presents is nothing short of stunning.

The Depository Trust Company sits at the center of the modern securities ownership model. Major banks and broker-dealers, with the help of a mysterious figure with a long history of working for and alongside the CIA, created DTC in the early 1970s with the stated goal of alleviating Wall Street's growing paperwork crisis.

CAROL ROTH: THE MONEY IN YOUR 'SAFE' SAVINGS ACCOUNT COULD VANISH OVERNIGHT

At the time, buying and selling securities was a slow, paperwork-heavy process. By centralizing registered ownership of securities in a single institution, transfers could be executed simply by changing records, which today occurs electronically. What once took several days could be completed almost instantly. 

Lawmakers were told this shift was a technical modernization designed to improve efficiency and reduce risk. In many respects, it did exactly that. The cost and time required to do business on Wall Street dropped dramatically after DTC's creation. But these gains came at a steep price. Centuries of property law were effectively discarded. Traditional securities ownership, grounded in clear title and constitutional protections, was replaced.

Under the current DTC model, most investors no longer directly own their securities. Instead, they hold what the law refers to as a "security entitlement." This arrangement is contractual in nature. It grants certain rights and protections, but it does not confer direct registered ownership. When you buy stock in a company, you do not actually acquire the stock itself. You get a set of investment rights tied to that stock.

NICKI MINAJ TO DONATE THOUSANDS TO TRUMP ACCOUNTS PROGRAM

This system raises serious ethical concerns. It delivers enormous benefits to the most powerful financial institutions while weakening the ownership rights of ordinary investors.



Centralized ownership allows securities transactions to be processed at extraordinary speed, fueling ever-increasing activity and on Wall Street. That activity generates massive fee revenue for large institutions.

In recent years, institutions have also reaped enormous profits from riskier practices such as stock lending and derivatives trading. These activities could not have occurred at anything close to their current scale under the stronger ownership framework that existed prior to DTC's creation. Centralized ownership made them possible.

Worse still, Wall Street and lawmakers did not stop there. In the 1990s, they leveraged centralized ownership to implement further changes to regulatory and legal codes designed to protect large financial institutions during systemic crises.

Under Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code, if a brokerage firm collapses during a financial crisis, secured creditors, including banks, may seize securities used as collateral in lending arrangements with broker-dealers. This can include customer securities, such as stocks and bonds, if they were pledged as collateral for those loans.

As a result, during the next major crash, investors could lose their entire portfolios if their broker-dealer pledged customer assets to obtain financing.

Current regulations generally prohibit investment firms from using most customer securities as collateral, other than for margin accounts. However, Article 8 permits secured creditors to seize customer assets pledged as collateral if a firm cannot pay its debts, even if the securities were improperly pledged.

Moreover, as I document in the book, existing emergency powers laws could be invoked during a crisis to alter or suspend rules meant to protect customers. Lawmakers could also enact new legislation that weakens current consumer safeguards.

The good news is that this problem is not irreversible.

Because the Uniform Commercial Code is state law, state legislatures have the authority to restore investor priority. A small number of lawmakers across the country have begun to recognize the danger and push back, but sustained public pressure will be required to achieve meaningful reform.

The next financial crash could arrive sooner or later, and its precise trigger is impossible to predict. What is predictable is the legal structure waiting on the other side. Unless Americans demand change now, many could discover too late that many of the rules governing their retirement savings were not designed to protect them.

Fox News chief congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on redistricting battles in Texas and California, and how a pending Supreme Court Voting Rights Act case could shift House control ahead of the 2026 midterms.

Democratic lawmakers say President Donald Trump's redistricting gambit is backfiring as Virginia's Democratic-controlled Senate advanced new congressional maps that could chip away at the House GOP's majority.

The Virginia Senate voted 21-16 along party lines on Wednesday to pass a set of new congressional maps that would leave just one Republican district in play.

Republicans currently hold five.

To Republicans like Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Va., that's too drastic a swing for a state that only has 11 districts to begin with. Even in light of similar redistricting pushes in Texas, California and other states, Wittman believes Virginia's case is unique.

"This partisan power grab is not reflective of Virginia. Virginia is a 6-5 congressional delegation: six Democrats, five Republicans. And now they want to go to 10 Democrats, one Republican — 92%," Wittman said.

"They're going to disenfranchise most Virginians, if not all of them, that are Republican or independent."

Despite the size of the change the maps would bring, Democrats believe it's just the latest continuation of a fight that Trump started.

"You have to fight fire with fire," Rep. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Va., told Fox News Digital.

"The voters that I'm talking to feel that we can't just sit back and be victims of redistricting. I don't think this would be happening unless [Trump] pushed for redistricting in Texas and other red states," Subramanyam said.

When asked if he thinks the changes would go too far, Subramanyam said he thinks Republicans will have a chance to press their case at the ballot box.

"If Republicans can win over the hearts and minds of Virginians, they will have a good cycle. It's a very volatile map in that sense, and so I know many have argued that this is actually fair. I would say that it's certainly a map where, if Republicans campaign well and their message resonates, they can win too," Subramanyam said.

Since Trump urged lawmakers in Texas to push through a map change in July 2025, state legislatures across the country have explored ways to squeeze out a congressional advantage where control of the House hangs by a two-seat thread.

Virginia's map change, on its own, would give Democrats a path to flipping control of the chamber in November.

But the maps aren't a sure thing. Their implementation turns on pending legal battles about whether the shakeup complies with the state's constitutional requirements, according to a complaint filed late last year.

On Friday, the Virginia Supreme Court ruled that the redistricting consideration could continue while it deliberates over a final ruling on whether the maps are permissible.

To become official, maps will also require a statewide constitutional referendum. Under current law, Virginia's constitution outlaws gerrymandering, the practice of drawing congressional districts to purposefully benefit a political party.

Subramanyam said the referendum gives voters a chance to express their will.

"It will come down to the voters. One good thing in Virginia is that people will have a say and can vote on the referendum in April. Folks in Texas, like where my family still lives, didn't have a choice," Subramanyam said, noting that Texas's redistricting push didn't require a constitutional amendment and was decided purely by the legislature.

Wittman believes the fact Virginia is looking to upend its own constitution should make the reshuffle a foregone conclusion.

When asked whether he sees Virginia's redistricting question as a consequence of the redistricting in Texas, Wittman said the two situations differ because of existing state law.

"Each state has their own constitution as to how they put together their congressional districts. Virginia's is very clear. A super majority of voters — 66% of the voters — said we want a bipartisan redistricting commission. That's Virginia," Wittman said, referring to the 2020 vote in Virginia that outlawed gerrymandering.

"Texas is doing what Texas and its constitution allow," he added.

Upon teeing up that referendum, Virginia Gov. Abigail Spanberger framed the action as a way to give Virginians a voice in a national debate over congressional redistricting.

"Virginia voters deserve the opportunity to respond to nationwide attacks on our rights, freedoms and elections… I trust Virginia voters to respond," Spanberger said in a statement.

Voters in the state will consider whether to "temporarily adopt new congressional districts to restore fairness in the upcoming elections" on April 21.

Why everyone is obsessed with Internal Family Systems, even though its claims are dubious.

Your Mileage May Vary is an advice column offering you a unique framework for thinking through your moral dilemmas. It's based on value pluralism — the idea that each of us has multiple values that are equally valid but that often conflict with each other. To submit a question, fill out this anonymous form. Here's this week's question from a reader, condensed and edited for clarity:

What's going on with Internal Family Systems therapy? It looks like IFS is becoming really popular, an increasing number of my friends are trying it, and mostly they report extremely positive experiences. But as far as I can tell, the evidence base for this kind of therapy is thin. A professional therapist I know with a PhD in psychology hadn't even heard of it. I asked a chatbot to rank the top 10 evidence-based therapies and IFS didn't even make the list.

So, I'm confused. Should I be trying to dissuade my friends from going to this kind of therapy? Or am I the one who's missing something, and maybe I should be trying IFS myself?

Dear Evidence-Based,

There's a mantra in IFS: Inside us, there are “no bad parts.” That may well be true of us, but I don't think it's true of IFS itself. This is a type of therapy that has a lot going for it, but it also has some parts that should absolutely make you skeptical.

Here's a basic primer for the uninitiated: IFS was developed in the 1980s by therapist Richard Schwartz. Inspired by family systems therapy, he argued that just as a family is made up of members who form alliances, get into conflicts, and protect each other in patterned ways — so too is your mind. You're not a single unified self; you're a collection of “parts,” each with its own agenda. To understand yourself, you have to understand the dynamics between these internal “family members.”

Schwartz says your parts fall into a few categories. “Exiles” are wounded parts that carry pain and shame from when you were younger. “Managers” are protectors that try to prevent those painful exiles from surfacing — for example, through perfectionism. “Firefighters” are like the emergency response team that jumps into action when painful exiles break through anyway; they'll use drinking, bingeing, or numbing out to protect you from the fiery, difficult feelings.

And finally, there's “Self” — note the capital S — which is your supposed true essence, undamaged by trauma, always waiting for you underneath everything else. Your Self is characterized by calm, curiosity, compassion, and clarity. If you can access it, you can more easily build trusting relationships with all your parts, understand why they developed the coping mechanisms they did, and gradually help them release the maladaptive ones so you can live a healthier life.

Okay. Got all that? Now, here's what I think is really going on.

There's a lot people like about the IFS model — and with good reason. Let's start with the core idea that your mind is not a single unified thing. That is both very intuitive and very scientifically true. You can tell it's intuitive because we all commonly say things like “a part of me wants X, but a part of me wants Y,” or “I'm of two minds about that.” We have a natural sense that we each contain multitudes. And that's because, well, we do! If you've ever taken a psychology or neuroscience class, you know that the brain isn't a single command center — it's a collection of systems that evolved at different times for different purposes, and they don't always agree.

IFS's acknowledgement of multiplicity is especially refreshing because Western philosophy has spent centuries trying to convince us that we humans are “the rational animal” — that rationality and cool logic are at the center of what it means to be human. In other words, there's a “real you,” that real you is rational, and if you sometimes engage in illogical behavior, that's just because passions are clouding your core judgment.

But the brain isn't actually organized that way. It's not a unified rational self. Your prefrontal cortex is not more “you” than your amygdala — they're both you, pulling in different directions. And by acknowledging that we're not fully rational beings, IFS frees us up from the expectation that we should be — a feature that bedevils other forms of therapy, like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. CBT is based on the idea that we can catch our automatic thoughts and assumptions, check to see if they're true, and simply change them if not. By consciously and logically adjusting our thoughts, we can, the thinking goes, transform how we feel about things.

This idea of a rational self in the driver's seat sure offers a nice sense of control — and it works to a degree (CBT has a strong evidence base when it comes to treating conditions like depression and anxiety). But you can't logic your way out of everything. Pretending that you can can be counterproductive. It can also make you feel ashamed: If you don't manage to get your moods and reactions under rational control, it feels like you've got nobody to blame but your one and only self.

By contrast, IFS insists that even though some parts of you may act in misguided ways, they're just trying their best to protect you. And that brings us to what is, for my money, the number one thing drawing people to IFS: This modality, and particularly the catchphrase “no bad parts,” gives people a rubric for tapping into self-compassion rather than self-judgment. For anyone with a loud inner critic, that is a huge deal.

When we see ourselves behaving maladaptively — whether it's staying up late doomscrolling or drinking way too much — it's really easy to hate ourselves for it. We think: I know that's not a smart thing to do, but I did it anyway — what's wrong with me? I'm such a screw-up! It's incredibly helpful to instead be able to say: This is coming from a part of me that's trying to protect me in some way, and even though it's not going about it very well, I know the intentions are good.

So it doesn't surprise me that so many people are flocking to IFS. It's got some genuinely positive aspects — and it doesn't hurt that movies like Inside Out helped popularize the idea that we're all made up of lots of little parts!

But holy hell are there also some problematic aspects to IFS.

For one thing, let's talk about the evidence base. There is…very little of it. Randomized controlled trials are the gold standard of medical evidence, and so far not a single one has been done on IFS as a treatment for a psychiatric disorder. As an investigation in The Cut noted last year, the strongest evidence for IFS, according to Schwartz, comes from a small 2013 study he co-wrote in which rheumatoid arthritis patients undergoing the therapy reported, on average, improved joint pain, reduced depressive symptoms, and more self-compassion several months later.

And yet IFS has been used in the treatment of all sorts of things — sometimes to patients' detriment. Some people with eating disorders have gotten sicker, The Cut reported, as their IFS treatment focused on dredging up harrowing memories rather than stabilizing them. And some people developed “memories” of being abused by their parents, only to later allege that those were false memories introduced in the course of IFS therapy.

Experts have also begun warning that encouraging a client to play out conversations between their parts can be dangerous if the client doesn't have a firm grasp on reality. “Our concern is that encouraging splitting of the self into parts for those who struggle with reality testing might be disorganizing,” wrote psychologist Lisa Brownstone and co-authors in a paper last year.

Even for very high-functioning clients, there's a feature of IFS therapy that risks leading them further away from what's real. Tell an IFS therapist that you're skeptical about some aspect of the therapy, and too often the therapist will say something like: Oh, that's your skeptical part talking. They may invite that part to express its thoughts, but you're still expected to buy the premise that your unease is coming from some part that's not to be fully trusted.

When any resistance tends to be interpreted as just another fearful part of you acting up, the therapeutic logic you end up with is a tight, self-confirming loop — one that makes it harder for you to challenge your therapist's depiction of reality, even if it seems off to you.

Likewise with the idea (fundamental to IFS) that your feelings can be located in specific parts of the body. If you tell an IFS therapist about an anxiety or a nagging doubt, they'll likely ask you where you can feel it in your body. Many people secretly feel…nothing. But it's Bessel van der Kolk's world, and we're all just living in it: So popular is the idea that “the body keeps the score,” that people sometimes feel implicit pressure to imagine they can locate an emotional pain somewhere physical.

One of my colleagues confessed to me that when he's been asked this, “all I can think of is ‘my shoulders'...because I have bad posture and have a desk job”! But once you've imagined that the nagging doubt lives in your shoulders, and you can feel the therapist waiting for your answer to this purportedly profound question, what do you do? You go for the first thing that comes to mind, and you say “my shoulders.”

If an individual walks away from a therapy session like this and feels better, I'm glad for them. But when IFS is being held up as a treatment for very serious conditions like depression and addiction, it really matters for the underlying science to be right.

That brings us to another issue: One of the core premises of IFS — the idea of the Self — is just not based on evidence. Ironically, for all its insistence that we are not unitary creatures, IFS does posit that underneath all our parts there is a unitary essence.

Believing that we each have a wise inner self is fine if you hold the idea lightly, as a kind of metaphor. But some IFS therapists talk about it way too literally.

When I tried IFS, I found this disorienting. Asked to connect with my Self, I remembered a day when I was 11 years old, singing joyously from the bleachers in my neighborhood park. Was that my one true Self? I didn't actually believe it was — it seemed more like one version of me, a version I like and want to cultivate more. But it was so clear that I was expected to identify this as Self that I played along.

This wasn't great, both because I felt epistemically wronged (I know the one true Self is not a thing), and because it would've actually been more empowering if I'd just been told: “No, this isn't the essential you, buried deep down within and therefore sometimes accessible but sometimes not. It's one possible you among many, and if you'd like to lean into it, you can choose to do that. And you can do that at any moment, because this is about your agency — not some preexisting metaphysical essence.”

Finally, while we're talking about metaphysics, I need to mention the demons.

Yes, you read that right. No, I don't mean allegorical demons.

Some leading figures in IFS, like the therapist and author Robert Falconer, believe that people sometimes become possessed by literal demons — though they call them “Unattached Burdens.” Last year, Falconer wrote a book about these malevolent beings and how to exorcise them, and Schwartz wrote the foreword. The journalist and researcher Jules Evans argues there's a significant risk that by talking to clients about these supposed demons, IFS therapists will end up actually implanting a belief in demons into their clients — which could terrify some clients and actually worsen their mental health. The power of suggestion is not to be underestimated.

So, should you try to get your friends to stop going to IFS therapy, even if they say they're having extremely positive experiences? It depends. If they suffer from a serious condition — an eating disorder, a history of abuse or trauma — then I do think it's good to make them aware of the problems with IFS. If their issues are more run-of-the-mill (think: someone who just doesn't get along great with their mom), then IFS might be helping them overall, even in spite of some of IFS's own features. In that case, you don't necessarily have to rush to ring the alarm, but I would periodically check in with them to make sure they're maintaining the ability to think critically about their experience.

And as for whether you should try IFS yourself? I wouldn't recommend starting on that path. I suspect you can reap a lot of the benefits of IFS without incurring its problematic metaphysical baggage. If, as I believe, one of the key advantages of IFS is that it helps people cultivate self-compassion, why not cut out the IFS middleman and go straight to the source by taking a self-compassion class?

A few years ago, I tried IFS therapy and, separately, an eight-week self-compassion course run by the nonprofit Center for Mindful Self-Compassion. I benefited a bit from the former, but I felt like it actually required me to push away some parts of myself. Meanwhile, I gained hugely from the latter, and I didn't feel like it asked me to leave my critical thinking at the door.

AYER, Mass. (AP) — Connor Murphy walked in circles around his dad, then flopped down on the kitchen floor, got up and walked in circles again.

His dad turned the 9-year-old's repetitive behavior into a chance to connect. “Want me to pick you up?” Matthew Murphy asked, lifting, tickling and spinning with his son.

Such spontaneous moments are common in the Murphy household, which revolves around the needs of Connor and his twin brother Ronan, who both have profound autism.

“They're going to need 24-7 care for the rest of their lives,” their father said. “Life will be a challenge for them, and we have to prepare them as best we can.”

Autism rates have been rising for decades, and two of the main reasons for the increase have, in a strange twist, taken some of the focus off helping people with round-the-clock needs. The diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, adopted in 2013, is now very broad, including many people with low support needs. Also, better awareness of the condition has helped many more children get diagnosed than in the past — and most of those cases are relatively mild. 

At the same time, the Trump Administration is promoting unproven and debunked claims about what causes autism, which experts say muddles efforts to understand the condition and fuels misinformation that threatens public health, even as officials funnel more money into research.

There's now a growing push to separate profound autism — in which people need constant care for life, have a certain level of intellectual disability and are nonspeaking or minimally verbal — into its own diagnosis. The hope is that it would help ensure that people like Connor and Ronan get the support and services they need and that research includes them. 




In the United States, an estimated 1 in 31 children have autism spectrum disorder. Researchers estimate around a quarter have “profound autism,” a term introduced in 2021 by a group of experts, the Lancet Commission, to describe people most disabled by the developmental condition.

But some in the autism community worry that creating a separate diagnosis would reduce attention on the broader spectrum and the individual needs of everyone on it.

Andy Shih, chief science officer for Autism Speaks, said no matter where people fall on the debate, “there's absolutely no doubt that we need to elevate awareness about the needs of this group.”

The Murphys knew early on that their children had a greater-than-average chance of having neurodevelopmental disabilities. Twin births are associated with a higher risk. Some studies suggest the type of in vitro fertilization they used is too.

The boys arrived nearly a month early. At first, the couple wasn't too concerned that the babies missed developmental milestones; twins born prematurely tend to run a bit behind. But when the boys weren't walking at around 1 ½ years old, the Murphys sought an evaluation and began speech and occupational therapy. At age 4, the boys were officially diagnosed with level 3 autism, representing the highest level of need, like profound autism.

Now, at 9, they often speak in one- to three-word sentences. They need reminders and intense guidance with daily activities like showering and brushing their teeth. They perform academically at the level of 3½-year-olds and like Sesame Street and preschool toys. And they require the same vigilance as preschoolers because they're vulnerable to dangers like darting into busy streets.

Last summer, Connor briefly left the house in his pajamas, without shoes, and walked half a mile.

“Our number one concern is their safety,” said their mom, Andrea Murphy, 47.

The Murphys have taken creative steps to protect the twins, including putting GPS locators in their shoes, sensors with alarms on all the windows and doors to the outside and locks requiring thumbprints on doors to the basement and a food cabinet. They worked to get the boys' schoolyard fenced in and raised money for their local police to have Project Lifesaver, a search-and-rescue program.

Still, they are hypervigilant whenever their children are with them and awake. “If that's at three in the morning, it's at three in the morning,” their dad said.

But safety concerns don't stop them from taking the boys out into the community.

One snowy Saturday, the family headed to Target. On the ride over, Ronan rocked back and forth in his seat. Inside the store, Andrea Murphy put her hand on Connor's back to make him feel secure as he walked behind the shopping cart.

Meanwhile, her husband made his way down a toy aisle with Ronan, who spotted Bluey figurines. The toys went in the cart, but then back on the shelf because the family already has the same ones at home. This upset Ronan, and he collapsed on the floor. As other shoppers walked by, his dad quietly calmed him, holding his hands to help him up.

Despite such challenges, the Murphys view these outings as beneficial -- for them, the boys and the community that sees them.

“We can't live our lives in a bubble,” said Matthew Murphy, 48. “We want them to experience life.”

Wherever they are, the Murphys focus on the joy amid the struggles. They nurture Ronan's artistic, outdoorsy, boisterous personality and Connor's quiet and reserved nature. And they savor the affection both boys shower on them -- like when Connor nuzzled into his mom as they sang “You Are My Sunshine” together.

“They bring a light to you no matter how bad of a day you're having,” their dad said. “It's all unconditional love.”

In the past, the boys may have been diagnosed with autistic disorder -- one of five subtypes, along with Asperger's, of a diagnosis called pervasive developmental disorders. But in 2013, the American Psychiatric Association removed that diagnosis and created autism spectrum disorder.

Judith Ursitti, president of the Profound Autism Alliance, is among those who now want profound autism separated out. People in this category lack appropriate treatments, supports and enough providers trained to handle their level of care, she said. And the vast majority of clinical research doesn't include them.

“If you don't have research, you won't have treatments. You won't have achievable services and supports,” said Ursitti, whose adult son has profound autism. “There are people across the spectrum who have high support needs that are intermittent. The difference with our population is they're constant.”

But Dena Gassner of Drexel University's autism institute -- an autistic senior research scientist and mother of an autistic adult with moderate support needs -- said she struggles with the idea of assigning someone the label of profound autism. She said it could be stigmatizing.

She said there's nothing wrong with being autistic; the problem lies in “the massive lack of supports and services” in our society. “We need to come together in a unified voice to talk about services for the entirety of the spectrum.”

Matthew Murphy doesn't see the harm in a new label to identify a separate level of need.

In the meantime, he and his wife do all they can to help their children thrive.

That includes arranging for professionals from The Autism Community Therapists in Acton to come to the house for three hours of applied behavior analysis every weekday after school.

One evening, Ronan sat with Julia Orareo at the kitchen table, practicing his language skills by giving her instructions on how to draw an elephant.

“Draw a body,” he said, and she did.

“How about an eye?” she prompted.

He thought for a second, then replied: “Draw an eye.”

“Good sentence!” she said.

Minutes later, he implored, “Do a hug?” And they did.

Connor, who was practicing language and matching skills in the living room, soon joined his brother at the kitchen table. They began a long process of trying new foods designed to expand their limited diets -- cherry tomatoes for Connor and broccoli for Ronan. 

“Seeing that on the plate is kind of step one. Step two is actually touching it. Step three would be kind of either smelling it or putting it to their lips,” Andrea Murphy said, explaining that there are even more steps after that. 

The long-term goal of such lessons is to help the boys become more independent.

A deadline of sorts looms: age 22, when public educational support for children ends in Massachusetts. The Murphys both work full-time -- Matthew at a nonprofit that helps injured veterans and Andrea in health care -- but they don't know how they can possibly earn enough to provide for their children throughout adulthood.

And they fear what will happen when they're gone.

“You never know when God is gonna take you off this green earth,” Matthew Murphy said. “The thing that keeps me awake at night is what their future looks like … That's the great unknown.”

NEW YORK (AP) — Tax season is underway and you have until April 15 to file your return with the IRS. If you want to avoid the stress of the looming deadline, start getting organized as soon as possible.

“Don't wait until the last minute but also don't rush,” said Tom O'Saben, director of tax content and government relations at the National Association of Tax Professionals,

Gathering all your documents, signing up for direct deposit and keeping copies of your tax returns are some of the best practices when it comes to preparing to fill out your taxes. This year, due to the Republican tax and spending bill that President Donald Trump signed over the summer, there are new deductions taxpayers should know about. 

Among them are no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, deductions for car loan interest, and deductions for people who were 65 or older by Dec. 31, said Miguel Burgos, a certified public accountant and an expert for TurboTax.

The average refund last year was $3,167. This year, analysts have projected it could be $1,000 higher, thanks to changes in tax law. More than 165 million individual income tax returns were processed last year, with 94% submitted electronically.

If you find the process too confusing, there are plenty of free resources to help you get through it.

Here are some things you need to know:




While the required documents might depend on your individual case, here is a general list of what everyone needs:

—Social Security number

—W-2 forms, if you are employed

—1099-G, if you are unemployed

—1099 forms, if you are self-employed

—Savings and investment records

—Any eligible deduction, such as educational expenses, medical bills, charitable donations, etc.

—Tax credits, such as the child tax credit, retirement savings contributions credit, etc.

To find a more detailed document list, visit the IRS website.

O'Saben recommends gathering all of your documents in one place before you start your tax return and also having your documents from last year. Taxpayers can also create an identity protection PIN number with the IRS to guard against identity theft. Once you create a number, the IRS will require it to file your tax return.

— Change to standard deduction

The standard deduction for single taxpayers is $15,750 for this year. For married couples filing jointly, it has increased to $31,500. For heads of households, the standard deduction is $23,625.

— Change to state and local taxes (SALT) deduction

The deduction cap on state and local taxes has increased from $10,000 to $40,000. The change is also known as the Working Families Tax Cut and was enacted in July 2025.

“This is a big benefit, especially for states like California, New York, and New Jersey, that have a higher state income tax,” said Keith Hall, president and CEO of the National Association for the Self-Employed and a certified CPA.

The SALT deduction is a federal tax deduction for some state and local taxes paid during the year. The total deduction had been capped at $10,000 since it started in 2018.

People who have not previously itemized their SALT deduction might want to consider it this year. To know if you should itemize your deductions, O'Saben recommends that you ask yourself the following questions: Did you pay state taxes? Did you pay property taxes? Do you have mortgage interest? Do you have charitable contributions?

—Deductions for tips

What is known as “no tax on tips” is not quite accurate. This new deduction is only for qualified tips and is subject to income limitations.

“It can be cash, it can be electronic as well. But the main thing is, hey, it has to be voluntary (tips),” Burgos said.

The maximum annual deduction is capped at $2,500. The deduction phases out for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income over $150,000, or $300,000 for joint filers. The tax deduction is also limited to specific industries where tipping is common practice. Some of the included industries are bartenders, food servers, musicians and housekeeping cleaners.

To claim the new tax break, you will need to fill out a new tax form called Schedule 1-A.

—Additional Schedule 1-A deductions

Schedule 1-A is an IRS form used to claim and calculate four tax deductions originating from the tax and spending bill. They are the change in state and local tax deduction, deduction on qualified tips, and car loan and senior deductions.

IRS Direct File, the electronic system for filing tax returns for free, will not be offered this year. For those who make $89,000 or less per year, IRS Free File offers free guided tax preparation; you can choose from eight IRS partners, such as TaxAct and FreeTaxUSA.

Beyond companies such as TurboTax and H&R Block, taxpayers can also hire licensed professionals, such as certified public accountants. The IRS offers a directory of tax preparers across the United States.

The IRS also funds two programs that offer free tax help: Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) and Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE). People who earn $69,000 or less a year, have disabilities, or are limited English speakers, qualify for the VITA program. Those who are 60 or older qualify for the TCE program. The IRS has a site for locating organizations hosting VITA and TCE clinics.

Many people fear getting in trouble with the IRS if they make a mistake. Here's how to avoid some of the most common ones:

—Double-check your name on your Social Security card

When working with clients, O'Saben asks them to double-check their number and their legal name, which can change when people get married.

“If you got married last year and you now want to use your married name, that married name doesn't exist if you haven't filed it with Social Security,” O'Saben said.

—Search for online tax statements

Many people opt out of physical mail but when you do, it can also include your tax documents.

“These documents may actually be available online because you may have chosen to have paperless contact. And because of that, you may need to go get those documents yourself,” O'Saben said.

—Make sure you report all of your income

If you had a second job in 2025, you need the W-2 or 1099 form for each job.

In general, if you make a mistake or you're missing something in your tax records, the IRS will audit you. An audit means that the IRS will ask you for more documentation.

Currently, the tax credit is $2,200 per child but only $1,700 is refundable. This refund is called the Additional Child Tax Credit. To claim the Additional Child Tax Credit, you must have at least $2,500 of income for the tax year.

You qualify for the full amount of the Child Tax Credit for each qualifying child if you meet all eligibility factors and your annual income is not more than $200,000 ($400,000 if filing a joint return). Parents and guardians with higher incomes may be eligible to claim a partial credit.

You can find more details about the child tax credit here.

Last September, the IRS began phasing out paper tax refund checks. If you're expecting a tax refund, the IRS recommends you sign up for direct deposit.

Tax season is prime time for tax scams, O'Saben said. These scams can come via phone, text, email and social media. The IRS uses none of those means to contact taxpayers.

Sometimes scams are even operated by tax preparers, so it's important to ask lots of questions. If a tax preparer says you will get a refund that is larger than what you've received in previous years, for example, that may be a red flag, O'Saben said.

If you can't see what your tax preparer is working on, get a copy of the tax return and ask questions about each of the entries.

It's always good practice to keep a record of your tax returns, just in case the IRS audits you for an item you reported years ago. O'Saben recommend keeping copies of your tax return documents five to seven years.

Democratic opponents of the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, also known as the SAVE America Act, have deployed dubious arguments against the latest version of the federal election integrity law.

In its third iteration, the “new and improved” SAVE America Act, which would require both proof of United States citizenship at the time of voter registration and physical identification when casting a ballot, passed the House this week despite scant Democratic support.

Only one House Democrat joined the GOP in advancing the nationwide voter ID bill, designed to prevent foreigners from infiltrating the U.S. election process.

As the SAVE America Act now heads to the Senate, Democrats are deploying some of the same fear-mongering rhetoric about voter suppression that they pushed previously in past fights over Republican-led election reform, though those predictions fell flat once put to the test at the ballot box.

Their most recent claims, also hyperbolic or reliant on far-fetched scenarios, similarly fail to survive basic scrutiny.

Some critics of the SAVE America Act, such as Vice President Kamala Harris, have argued that certain voters cannot possibly photocopy their identification documents due to a supposed dearth of photocopy services.

In a 2021 interview that recently went viral on social media, Harris publicly opposed voter ID legislation because she said it would be “almost impossible” for Americans living in remote areas to make photocopies of their ID cards.

“You're going to have to Xerox or photocopy your ID to send it in to prove you are who you are,” Harris told BET News. “Well, there are a whole lot of people, especially people who live in rural communities, [where] there are no Kinko's, there's no Office Max near them.”

Kinko's no longer exists. It was bought by FedEx in 2006 and operated subsequently as FedEx Office. By 2019, FedEx Office was offering photocopy services at 2,000 locations across the country — and it is far from the only place where customers today can make copies of their documents.

Thousands of places providing photocopy services, whether commercial or self-service, currently exist in the U.S. In fact, on-the-spot photocopying is accessible in every state.

Photocopy machines are widely available at more than 5,300 UPS Store locations, 831 Staples sites, 9,207 public libraries, and over 4,700 CVS stores across the country.

REPUBLICANS LOOK TO USHER THROUGH VOTER ID LEGISLATION FOR THIRD TIME WITH SAVE AMERICA ACT

Furthermore, the vast majority of voters would not even need to provide photocopies under the SAVE America Act, and would only need to do so in instances where they vote by absentee ballot.

In most cases, residents registering to vote can simply show their passport, or other government-issued ID displaying a U.S. birthplace, at their Department of Motor Vehicles office. While voting, U.S. citizens need only present “a tangible (not digital)” document bearing their photograph and citizenship status.

Voters unable to appear in person at the polling place on Election Day must include a copy of their photo ID with requests for and submissions of an absentee ballot. But the measure making its way through Congress takes these rural, shut-in, and disabled voters into account.

A subsection of the SAVE America Act, titled “ACCESSIBILITY,” would require each state to ensure that voters casting a ballot by mail have access to “reasonable accommodations,” such as scanning and printing services, for submitting the mail-in forms.

Democratic leadership is also likening the SAVE America Act to racist Jim Crow-era legislation, warning without evidence that the 2026 bill will likewise work to suppress the black vote.

In a social media statement, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) claimed that the bill would disenfranchise millions of black voters.

 “The SAVE Act is nothing more than Jim Crow 2.0,” said Schumer, declaring, “Every single Senate Democrat will vote against any bill that contains it,” after Republicans initially sought to include it in a funding package.

However, legislation containing voter ID requirements has actually proven to increase voter turnout, including among black Americans.

REMEMBER DEMOCRATS' LIES ABOUT GEORGIA VOTER SUPPRESSION?

Following the passage of Georgia's Election Integrity Act of 2021, or S.B. 202, the state smashed turnout records in the 2022 midterms, breaking the 2 million voter mark during the general election's early-voting window.

S.B. 202 expanded the number of early voting days in Georgia, and voters accordingly took advantage of the lengthened early-voting period at a record pace, the George State Secretary's Office reported at the time.

The number of votes cast on Day One of early voting surged to nearly twice the figures recorded in 2018.

That year, Georgia witnessed unprecedented voter turnout across the board. In the 2022 primaries, the state saw a 212% jump in early voting above 2020, the last presidential primary year.

Many of the early voters were black, an outcome which the Black Voters Matter Fund celebrated.

“Voter turnout in Georgia reached historic highs on the first day of early voting in this midterm election, and Black Voters comprised 35% of all those who turned out to vote,” the BLM organization, composed of voting rights activists, touted at the time.

Notably, many black-majority countries, like Haiti and Jamaica, have their own voter ID laws. And the long list of African nations that enforce ID-based voter eligibility regulations include Kenya, Niger, Chad, Burkina Faso, Botswana, Mali, Mauritania, Ghana, South Africa, and Senegal.

Democrats are characterizing Republican attempts to tighten registration requirements as an affront to women's suffrage, renewing allegations that requiring supporting documentation of U.S. citizenship would somehow infringe on the voting rights of married women all over America who have legally changed their maiden name.

Progressives say that if women's names upon marriage do not match the surnames on their birth certificates, they will be deprived of the right to vote.

Proof of citizenship, however, is not limited to birth certificates, according to the SAVE America Act. The bill's proposed language stipulates that a valid driver's license indicating citizenship; a U.S. passport; military ID; or official photo identification from a federal, state, local, or tribal government showing one's place of birth was within the U.S. are all acceptable forms of documentary proof at the registration booth.

In the absence of the other options, only then are registrants supposed to produce photo ID paired with a birth certificate to satisfy the SAVE America Act's requirements.

NO ONE IS BUYING THE DEMOCRATS' GENDER WAR ATTACKS ON VOTER ID AND THE SAVE ACT

If someone's supporting documents do not match their birth name because they got married, divorced, were adopted, or changed their name for any number of reasons, the SAVE America Act would compel states to create a fallback process for people in those specific predicaments.

Under guidance from the Federal Election Assistance Commission, each state will have to establish a safety net system in which applicants are allowed to sign a sworn affidavit attesting to their U.S. citizenship and submit “other evidence” to a local election official demonstrating such. 

Although the bill does not explicitly spell out what “other evidence” entails, it could include records explaining mismatched or missing paperwork that help bridge gaps in identity confirmation.

The last time the SAVE America Act was up for consideration, House Republicans specified that the bill does not rule out letting married women use a combination of documents to account for any discrepancies due to name changes.

A 2025 study from the University of Maryland found that only 2% of voting-eligible Americans do not possess documentary proof of citizenship and another 7% who do have proof cannot easily access it.

The researchers defined “easy access” as being able to readily retrieve the document within 24 hours, restricted by situations such as if a birth certificate is in another state, lost, held by a family member, or locked away in a filing system.

A Ukrainian drone strike ignited fires at one of Russia's Black Sea ports, officials said Sunday, ahead of fresh talks aimed at ending the nearly 4-year-old war.

Two people were wounded in the attack on the port of Taman in the Krasnodar region, which damaged an oil storage tank, warehouse and terminals, according to regional Gov. Veniamin Kondratyev.

Meanwhile, falling debris from Russian drones damaged civilian and transport infrastructure in Ukraine's Odesa region, officials said, causing disruption to the power and water supply.

Ukraine's long-range drone strikes on Russian energy sites aim to deprive Moscow of the oil export revenue it needs to pursue its full-scale invasion. Russia wants to cripple the Ukrainian power grid, seeking to deny civilians access to heat, light and running water in what Kyiv officials say is an attempt to “weaponize winter.”

The attacks came ahead of another round of U.S.-brokered talks between envoys from Russia and Ukraine on Tuesday and Wednesday in Geneva, just before the fourth anniversary of the all-out Russian invasion of its neighbor on Feb. 22.

Speaking at the Munich Security Conference in Germany on Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested there were still questions remaining over future security guarantees for his country. Zelenskyy also questioned how the concept of a free trade zone — proposed by the U.S. — would work in the Donbas region, which Russia insists Kyiv must give up for peace.

He said the Americans want peace as quickly as possible and that the U.S. team wants to sign all the agreements on Ukraine at the same time, whereas Ukraine wants guarantees for the country's future security signed first.




Zelenskyy's concerns were echoed by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a ranking member of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

“Unless we have real security guarantees on whatever peace agreement is ultimately determined, we are going to be here again, because one of the things we know is that Russia has geared up not just for Ukraine, but to go beyond Ukraine,” she told reporters in Munich on Sunday.

European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said Russia was hoping to win diplomatically what it had failed to achieve on the battlefield, and was banking on the U.S. to deliver concessions at the negotiating table. But Kallas told the Munich conference Sunday that key Russian demands — including the lifting of sanctions and unfreezing of assets — were decisions for Europe. 

“If we want a sustainable peace then we need concessions also from the Russian side,” she said.

Previous U.S.-led efforts to find consensus on ending the war, most recently two rounds of talks in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, have failed to resolve difficult issues, such as the future of Ukraine's Donbas industrial heartland that is largely occupied by Russian forces.

            Hot Stocks 





            Back in December, Kevin Warsh hinted how he may argue for lower interest rates.
    


            AI is ushering in “the most productivity-enhancing wave of our lifetimes — past, present and future,” Warsh, who was nominated by President Donald Trump as Fed chair on January 30, said in an interview with fintech entrepreneur Sadi Khan. The technology could prove to be “structurally disinflationary” like the internet, Warsh said, suggesting the Fed may have a clear path to continue lowering rates.
    


            In recent years, US productivity has grown at a robust pace, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. In economics, if productivity is strong, then growth can run hot without stoking inflation — this means the Fed doesn't have to step in with interest rate hikes. It's unclear if that same logic can apply to rate cuts.
    


            If he's confirmed by the Senate to lead the central bank after Chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May, Warsh will preside over a 12-person rate-setting committee that has become starkly divided in recent months. Fed chairs are tasked with building consensus around rate decisions, with each person having only one vote, including the chair.
    


            That means Warsh has to convince his colleagues — some of whom are still concerned about inflation — that AI-driven productivity is enough for additional interest rate cuts. But it's too soon to conclude AI will boost productivity in a long-lasting way, according to most economists, and some key monetary policymakers have already suggested it may not even warrant lower rates.
    


            When Warsh served as a Fed governor from 2006 to 2011, he was known for his “hawkish” views, or preference for policies that restrain the economy and keep a lid on inflation.
    


            He has since changed his tune and is now more in line with the Trump administration, which, in addition to wanting lower rates, also believes the US economy is in the throes of a historic productivity boom, similar to the one during the dot-com era.
    


            “It's clear that we are at the nascent stages of a productivity boom, not unlike the 1990s,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC recently. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, who was a finalist for Fed chair, has also echoed that view.
    


            Some current central bankers — such as Fed governors Christopher Waller and Lisa Cook, in addition to Powell himself — have concluded AI has the potential to significantly boost productivity.
    


            Warsh argues Fed policymakers should take the same leap of faith on the new technology that they did with the internet, under Fed Chair Alan Greenspan, and lean toward looser monetary policy.
    


            In his December interview, Warsh pointed out how Greenspan “believed based on anecdotes and rather esoteric data that we weren't in a position where we needed to raise rates,” despite signs that the economy was heating up at the time.
    


            “As a result we had a stronger economy, we had more stable prices,” Warsh said.
    


            Economists say productivity is usually understood better in retrospect, but Greenspan concluded that policymakers should let the economy run hot because anecdotes all pointed to strong productivity aided by the internet.
    


            “Recognizing that the economy was in the early stages of a productivity boom helped the Greenspan-led Fed hold off on interest rate hikes in the 1990s,” Michael Pearce, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in an analyst note Friday.
    


            “But it wasn't an argument for cutting rates into accommodative territory,” he said.
    


            Robust productivity paving the way for lower borrowing costs might be a tough sell for some Fed policymakers.
    


            Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, who votes on policy moves this year, said in a December interview with the Wall Street Journal that stronger productivity could translate into a higher so-called “neutral rate of interest,” a theoretical level of borrowing costs that neither stimulates nor weakens economic activity.
    


            “That could be more upward biased, if (AI) is having more material productivity impact,” Hammack said, who has also telegraphed her concerns with 2026 being the fifth consecutive year of elevated inflation.
    


            A higher neutral rate implies that the economy can withstand higher interest rates, an argument directly against the big rate cuts the Trump administration wants.
    


            Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, who is also a Fed voter this year, recounted in a 2024 speech a series of anecdotes of AI enhancing productivity for businesses across industries. But like Hammack, Logan is described by economists as a hawk, still concerned about inflation, and has suggested she would have cast a dissenting vote on the Fed's decision to cut rates in December.
    


            “Productivity is an important and powerful force, but it's one of the great unknowns of economics,” said Josh Jamner, senior investment strategy analyst at ClearBridge Investments. “A lot of people compare this to the late 90s, but if you look back to that time, there was also a meaningful amount of labor-force growth going on.”
    


            “Now we have an aging population and shifts in immigration policy that have made labor-force growth harder, so there are similarities with the 90s, but there are also some important differences,” he added.

            A mother shot dead outside a supermarket. A man killed after leaving a mosque. A doctor gunned down while treating patients. These shocking cases are no longer anomalies: they are the toll of a violent crime epidemic sweeping across Israel.
    


            The victims are all Palestinian citizens of Israel. Homicides in their community have risen so dramatically that one person has been killed every day on average this year. Palestinian citizens make up 20% of the country's population, and many say the Israeli government has not only failed to curb the crime wave, but that its inaction has helped spur a cycle of violence largely perpetrated by Arab organized crime groups.
    


            The data bears out a stark inequality: Israel Police has solved just 15% of homicides in Israel's Arab communities versus 65% among Jewish Israelis, according to data from Israel's parliament, the Knesset, and Eilaf, the Center for Advancing Security in Arab Society.
    


            Palestinian citizens of Israel are descendants of those who were not expelled or forced to flee their homes when Israel was established in 1948. They were given citizenship but lived under military rule until 1966, and many say they continue to face discrimination in Israeli society.
    


            Last year was the deadliest on record for the community, with 252 killed – the vast majority by gunfire – according to a report published by Abraham Initiatives, a group that advances social inclusion and equal rights for Israel's Palestinian citizens.
    


            And 2026 is already off to a bloody start, with 46 killed so far, according to the group.
    


            It is a deadly reality that has raised alarm bells, with tens of thousands of the country's Palestinian citizens taking to the streets in recent weeks – joined by some Jewish Israelis – to demand government action.
    


            “No to killing, no to death, we want to live in justice,” demonstrators chanted in Arabic at a January protest in Sakhnin, a majority Palestinian city in northern Israel, which drew tens of thousands of people.
    


            Attendees told CNN it was the largest demonstration the Arab community has seen in years, culminating a multi-day general strike from shop owners.
    


            What began there has since grown into a nationwide protest movement, with strikes and demonstrations taking place almost daily across Israel. Streets across the country were filled with a sea of black flags and water fountains were dyed red as citizens declared a “national day of disruption.”
    


            A week after the Sakhnin strike, Israeli President Isaac Herzog made a rare visit to the city, where he met with local Arab authorities and protest organizers.
    


            He said the fight against crime and violence in the Arab community “must be at the very top of the national priorities and be addressed with the utmost determination” calling it a “moral obligation.”
    


            And on Thursday, Israel's Police Commissioner Daniel Levi declared crime in the Arab community “a state of national emergency” and “an intolerable situation that must stop.”
    


            He called on other government agencies to join the police in helping address the issue.
    


            For many Palestinian citizens of Israel, those declarations ring hollow. Qasem Awad has waited for more than a year for his son's killer to be brought to justice.
    


            His son, Abdullah, a doctor from Mazra'a in the western Galilee, was treating a mother and her two children at a clinic last February when a masked gunman walked in and fatally shot him at close range. He was 30 at the time.
    


            Abdullah had been filling in for another doctor that day. His father believes he was mistaken for someone else.
    


            “If you look at the Palestinian Arab community in Israel, how many are being killed daily and for no reason?” Awad said. “These people have nothing to do with the world of crime. They are collateral damage, and my son is one of them.”
    


‘People are suffocating.' Bedouins in Israel say Gaza war has worsened decades of marginalization



            In the days following Abdullah's death, his parents say Israel Police visited and assured them they would investigate his death and identify the perpetrator.
    


            More than a year later, the pledge remains unfulfilled, and the family says it hasn't heard from law enforcement authorities.
    


            If his son had been Jewish, Awad believes the killer would've been arrested “in an hour”.
    


            Like many others in his community, Awad believes the Israeli government intentionally neglects crime perpetrated against Palestinian citizens.
    


            “It is part of a policy to divide and conquer. ‘Let them kill each other while we sit back and relax,'” he said.
    


            Awad points to the speed with which Palestinian perpetrators are brought to justice in crimes against Israelis.
    


            “The technological tools and know-how are available for them to catch the killers. But when it is affecting the Arab demographic, they no longer have the tools or the know-how?” he asked.
    


            According to the Eilaf report, Palestinian citizens of Israel face “selective enforcement” of the law.
    


            “On the one hand, a tough approach towards political activity and freedom of expression, and on the other, a soft approach towards criminals and crime,” the report said.
    


            In response to a query from CNN, the Israel Police said in a statement that a “thorough and complex investigation was launched” following the killing of Dr. Awad, where authorities have questioned “dozens of involved parties, with the aim of locating the suspects and uncovering the truth.”
    


            Data compiled by Abraham Initiatives shows that homicide cases among Palestinian citizens of Israel more than doubled in 2023.
    


            That was far-right Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir's first full year overseeing the police.
    


            Ben Gvir, who was convicted for supporting terrorism and inciting anti-Arab racism, has rejected responsibility, instead blaming local Arab leaders for turning a “blind eye” to criminal activity. Last month, he said he had “allocated enormous resources to the fight against crime and criminal organizations.”
    


            Critics say his actions speak louder than his words. Within months of entering office, Ben Gvir cut off key funding for an anti-Arab crime initiative called “Stop the Bleeding,” launched by the previous government. The next year, he dismissed the police official in charge of fighting crime in Arab society and put a lower-ranking official in his place.
    


            On Sunday, Ben Gvir defended the job he's done, saying on Kan Reshet Bet radio that there have been “great successes” during his tenure. “I don't work for the Arabs, not just for the Arabs,” he said. “I work for everyone.”
    


            “There is 20% less murder in the Jewish sector, let's put that on the table … 60% fewer murders of Jewish women, and 20% fewer car thefts.” Ben Gvir said crime in the Arab sector is a “grave phenomenon” and he intends to “combat it.” But he blamed the Attorney General, with whom he has had an ongoing feud, and “40 years of neglect” from authorities for the surge, despite record killings during his tenure.
    


Iranian strikes expose bomb shelter shortage for Palestinian towns inside Israel



            The concern is not only the surge in killings, but the increasing brazenness with which they are carried out.
    


            According to Eilaf's report, three out of four killings last year occurred in public spaces, indicating the “dangerous normalization of open crime… without any real fear of immediate intervention or effective deterrence.”
    


            “In light of weak governance, limited police presence, and declining trust in institutions, organized crime in Arab towns found a fertile ground for expansion, gradually building its economic and social influence by exploiting the vacuum left by the state,” said Rawyah Handaqlu, the head of Eilaf.
    


            She says the violence reflects the “exclusion and marginalization” of Palestinian citizens of Israel, arguing that the state has frequently relegated crime and violence to simply being a product of Arab society, which “holds society responsible for a reality imposed on it.”
    


            Aida Touma-Suleiman, a Palestinian member of the Knesset who actively raises the crime issue in parliament, believes the first step to eradicate crime in the Arab community is to topple the right-wing government, which she describes as “racist, fascist and criminal.”
    


            “When the government is not acting… not holding the criminals responsible and not prosecuting them, it's like sponsoring them,” she told CNN at the Sakhnin protest. “We want them to do the work they are supposed to do, and we want to give our young people the security to develop and to feel that they are living.”
    


            In December, the Israeli Prime Minister's Office announced plans to redirect $70 million from a program designed to promote Arab economic development to the police to address “severe nationalistic crime” in the Arab community.
    


            The Mosawa Center, a group advocating equal rights for Palestinian citizens, called it a “dangerous political step” that would do nothing to combat crime.
    


            “While the ministry fails to use the budgets already at its disposal, it is pushing to cut budgets allocated to other areas such as education and housing and transfer them to its own coffers,” it said in a statement. “This can only be interpreted as a deliberate policy of further impoverishing Arab society and plunging it deeper into crises, including the scourge of crime.”
    


            Back at his home in Mazra'a, Awad's wait for justice continues. He finds comfort only in the photographs of his late son.
    


            Asked if he has any hope that there will be justice for his death, he sighs and points to the ceiling.
    


            “Justice only exists up there, with God.”

Hundreds of thousands of protesters took to the streets in Munich, Germany, on Saturday to rally against Iran‘s regime and urge President Donald Trump to intervene militarily.

Protesters congregated in Munich as a security conference featuring top Trump administration officials and European leaders takes place in the city this weekend. The demonstration reportedly saw around 200,000 people attend, with many waving pre-revolution Iranian flags, holding posters of exiled crown prince Reza Pahlavi, and chanting calls for regime change.

Pahlavi himself attended the Munich protest after his “Global Day of Action” spurred demonstrations across the globe. A key opposition figure whose family ruled Iran until the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Pahlavi positioned himself as the leader of any transition government if the regime is indeed toppled.

“I am here to guarantee a transition to a secular democratic future. I am committed to be the leader of transition for you so we can one day have the final opportunity to decide the fate of our country through a democratic, transparent process to the ballot box,” he told the massive crowd.

Pahlavi was joined by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who has been firmly behind the Iranian protesters after the regime's security forces killed thousands of them last month.

Graham, donning a “Make Iran Great Again” hat, received a loud ovation from the crowd and was seen waving the pre-revolution Iranian flag as demonstrators broke out into “USA” chants. In his remarks, he repeatedly assured the Iranian people that “help is on the way,” referencing potential large-scale U.S. military action against Tehran.

Trump, however, has wavered on both prospects that Pahlavi and Graham envisioned for Iran's future on Saturday.

About Pahlavi potentially leading the country in some capacity, Trump has suggested he may not have popular support. Trump has also, thus far, declined meeting Pahlavi, who has lived in Washington since his family's exile in 1979.

Possible military intervention in Iran, meanwhile, has been on Trump's mind for months. After vowing to attack if Iran killed protesters, he held off after he claimed the regime canceled scheduled executions.

Instead, Trump has surged military assets to the region, including what is now two U.S. aircraft carriers, as he weighs a response. He has also remained open to a nuclear deal with Iran, though only one round of talks has been held and the regime has been unwilling to stop enrichment or end its ballistic missile program.

Nonetheless, a second round of negotiations will be held on Tuesday in Geneva, according to multiple reports.

Habits shape how we work, how we manage stress, and how we relate to others. They determine whether we move closer to our goals, or repeat the same mistakes.

The same is true in our romantic relationships. Our satisfaction, stability and sense of connection are directly related to the behaviors we default to every day. 

As a psychologist who studies couples — and as a husband — I've seen how some of the most powerful relationship rituals also happen to be the simplest. Here are five habits that reliably show up in the happiest, most resilient relationships.

Humans are biologically wired to focus on the negative. This bias helped our ancestors survive by scanning for threats. But in modern relationships, it often leads to pessimism, criticism or chronic dissatisfaction.

Over time, a glass-half-empty mindset trains partners to look for problems rather than moments worth appreciating. That's why what researchers call "capitalization," or how partners respond when the other shares good news, is so important.

Studies show that when people respond with enthusiasm (i.e., asking questions, expressing interest, celebrating wins), couples report higher relationship satisfaction and stronger emotional bonds.

Feeling like your partner is "your person" matters a lot, but no one can realistically meet all of another person's emotional, social and psychological needs.

Happy couples invest in friendships, family relationships and community connections, both together and independently. It prevents the relationship from becoming overburdened by unrealistic expectations.

When partners feel socially supported beyond the relationship, they're less likely to feel resentful, trapped or emotionally depleted. The relationship becomes a place of choice, not obligation.

Variety is called the spice of life for a reason. Even strong relationships can begin to feel stale when the novelty disappears. This is especially true for couples who live together and work demanding jobs; the cycle of work, home, sleep and repeat can become monotonous over time.

This is why happy couples actively seek out what researchers call “third spaces," or environments that exist outside of home (the first place) and work (the second place). It could be a favorite café, a climbing gym, a walking trail, a trivia night, or a class they take together.

The primary purpose of the third space is intentional exploration. When you regularly introduce new third spaces into your routine, you inject a sense of novelty and adventure without needing to travel or make any major life changes.

Consistency and support are foundational in healthy relationships. But over time, some couples begin to over-rely on one another — for emotional regulation, decision-making or daily logistics. This can slowly lead to codependence.

Happy couples counteract this by practicing independence. They maintain solo hobbies, spend time alone, or handle some responsibilities individually.

This independence is vital for maintaining a sense of self. More importantly, it enables something many couples underestimate the value of: the chance to miss one another.

Waking up next to the same person every day can create the illusion of deep familiarity. Many couples assume that physical closeness naturally begets emotional closeness, but this is not the case. People grow and change in little ways more often than we realize.

Happy couples always remain curious. They remind themselves that they're both constantly evolving. By making time to ask questions, they also begin to notice all the new dreams, wants and needs in their partner. This protects them from one of the most common relationship pitfalls: distance despite proximity.

Employers don't appear eager to mix their 401(k) plans with emergency savings options for workers, new research suggests.

Although companies have been permitted since 2024 to allow $1,000 emergency withdrawals from retirement savings and to offer 401(k)-linked emergency savings accounts, there's been little adoption, according to a Vanguard report released this week. 

Just 4% allow the $1,000 emergency 401(k) withdrawals, according to Vanguard's analysis of 1,300 plans. And the 401(k)-linked emergency savings accounts "have generated minimal to no interest" from employers, the report notes.

Those two in-plan options were authorized under the 2022 retirement legislation known as Secure Act 2.0, amid growing concern about Americans' lack of emergency savings.

Although the vast majority of employers are not providing the 401(k)-linked accounts — technically called pension-linked emergency savings accounts — some companies are offering external emergency savings accounts, said Craig Copeland, director of wealth benefits research for the Employee Benefit Research Institute. These external accounts are generally held at FDIC-insured banks and after-tax contributions are made through payroll deductions.

Building and maintaining emergency savings can be tricky for many households, especially those that are struggling to keep up with the high cost of living. Although inflation has eased to a yearly rate of 2.4% since peaking at 9.1% in June 2022, prices overall have climbed more than 25% since 2020, based on the consumer price index.

Financial advisors generally recommend having three to six months' worth of living expenses set aside as emergency savings.

Yet just 47% of respondents in a December survey said they have the funds to cover a $1,000 emergency expense, according to Bankrate's yearly Emergency Savings Report, released last week. Additionally, 29% said they have more credit card debt than they do in emergency savings. 

Last year, employer worries about their workers' financial well-being reached a new high: 48% rated their concern at 9 or 10 on a scale of 1 to 10, up from 43% in 2024 and 39% in 2023, according to December research from EBRI. As recently as 2019, the year before the pandemic hit, that share stood at 22%.

Secure 2.0 created the pension-linked emergency savings accounts as a "sidecar" to a 401(k). That is, they are established and maintained within the 401(k) plan itself. Among other particulars, contributions are after-tax — treated as Roth contributions — and count toward the 401(k) contribution limit. For 2026, that amount is $24,500, with investors age 50 and older allowed an additional $8,000.

The legislation set the maximum annual contribution for the emergency account at $2,500 with inflation adjustments in the future, and this year it was increased to $2,600. 

As for the $1,000 emergency 401(k) withdrawal: Most employers — 94% as of 2024, according to Vanguard — already allow their workers to access their retirement savings if they are facing financial hardship. 

"In many cases, it would add something that's already being provided," Copeland said.

While employers have largely eschewed the Secure 2.0 emergency savings provisions, that could change over time. 

"If a plan sponsor wants to move forward with an emergency savings program at their company, they're going to analyze the options available, and part of that [analysis] will be what's easiest to implement," said Will Hansen, executive director of the Plan Sponsor Council of America.

"A $1,000 withdrawal is easier than a [401(k)-linked account] and an account not affiliated with the plan could be an easier feature as well," Hansen said.

Among other administrative complexities, one of the sticking points with 401(k)-linked accounts is that highly compensated employees — under one IRS test, those earning $160,000 or more — are not permitted to participate. That's an administrative challenge because workers' incomes can fluctuate, which makes it tricky for a 401(k) plan's recordkeeper to monitor, said Brandie Barrows, a partner with Hall Benefits Law in San Francisco.

A bipartisan bill introduced in December in both the House and Senate would expand eligibility to use the accounts. Called the Emergency Savings Enhancement Act, the measure would eliminate the exclusion for highly compensated employees and would increase the annual contribution limit to $5,000.

"It wouldn't hurt to take that exclusion off and increase the amount that people can save," Barrows said.

In the meantime, experts say, employers will likely continue to partner with external firms that offer emergency savings accounts. Recent research from EBRI shows that 51% of firms with 500 or more employees offer some sort of emergency fund. That includes external savings accounts, but is not broken out in the data.

"If they offer it outside the plan, it's pretty straightforward," Copeland said. "It's less complicated" than setting up an account within the 401(k) plan, he said. 

There is a liquidity issue, as well, with keeping emergency funds inside a 401(k) plan, Copeland said. "Outside the plan, it's much easier to get your money immediately, whereas getting it out of the plan could take two to three days at a minimum," he said.

At some point in the 1980s and 90s, the free hot breakfast became a staple of the hospitality industry. At many a Holiday Inn or Hampton Inn, the lobby at 8 a.m. is a pinwheel of pajama-clad kids, frazzled parents, and solo business travelers jockeying for position in front of the waffle maker. Meanwhile, self-serve cereal bars dispense Froot Loops and Lucky Charms, and hot platters of endless eggs and turkey sausage steam under heat lamps. For many, this breakfast spread is part of the appeal of travel. It endures to this day, but it is facing new economic threats and evolving hotel business models. 

At hotels, which have been ditching items like free soaps and even bathroom doors to economize, the free breakfast is a sacred cow that some worry will not survive, increasingly seen by hotel operators as an money pit eating into the thin margins of the business. Last year, Hyatt Hotels' Hyatt Place brand removed free breakfast from 40 of its properties. Holiday Inn, owned by IHG, eliminated a la carte breakfast items in favor of a buffet-only model — a cost-cutting measure that preserves the breakfast buffet offering while reducing labor and food waste. 

Gary Leff, who runs the travel blog View from the Wing and first reported on Holiday Inn's breakfast changes, said that the threat to the free breakfast should be viewed within the broader trend in the lodging industry to look for ways to cut costs for owners. "That goes far beyond breakfasts, to things like housekeeping — less often during a stay, less extensive when it's done during a stay — to bulk toiletries rather than individual mini-bottles to eliminating products like alarm clocks in rooms," Leff said. 

Despite the free breakfast's staying power, the math never added up for the business, according to Curtis Crimmins, the CEO and founder of boutique hotel concept Roomza. "It was a loyalty play — a loss leader meant to drive signups, repeat bookings, and extended brand loyalty. I would argue that once free breakfast makes the shift from being a 'surprise and delight' endearing moment to an expectation, then its days are numbered," Crimmins said. "Looking for proof of this slow demise in your average Holiday Inn Express breakfast area? Look no further than the recent explosion of 'Grab and Go' options. That's not a coincidence," he said. 

Leff says that catering to a more affluent customer, as in the case of Hyatt Hotels, may offer operators more latitude to eliminate breakfast. 

A Hyatt spokesperson said while the company has "tested breakfast options at select Hyatt Place hotels that offer guests the ability to book rates that do not include breakfast ... Most Hyatt Place hotels in the U.S. continue to offer complimentary breakfast to all guests."

Evaluations are ongoing. "As part of our ongoing commitment to delivering value to our guests, including World of Hyatt members, we are continually evaluating breakfast options that best serve our guests and our hotels," the Hyatt spokesperson said.    

Leff says Hyatt has not released data on the trial, and many guests probably just assume breakfast will be free when they book at this point. "Unclear yet whether Hyatt can get away with not doing limited-service breakfast," he said. 

In the current economy with higher-income consumers leading the spend, luxury has been a bright spot within travel. Marriott International CEO Anthony Capuano describes the hotel business right now as being emblematic of the K-shaped economy receiving so much attention. "There are economic headwinds and some uncertainty but we continue to see the consumer prioritizing travel and experiences," Capuano told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" last week after its most recent earnings. "Luxury was a real highlight for us," Capuano said, adding that 10 percent of Marriott's portfolio is in the luxury tier.  

Marriott has made breakfast changes in some overseas luxury locations. For instance, the Regis Macao eliminated free breakfast for Platinum, Titanium, and Ambassador loyalty members as of March 2025 and replaced it with bonus points or discounted breakfast instead. Some Reddit users have posted this month about free omelettes disappearing from Marriott breakfast bars and now being part of the paid full breakfast buffet, but a Marriott spokesman said that is not a company-wide policy and, if true, would be individual hotel operators making that decision. 

The consumer split is leading to a bifurcation of breakfast models, with higher-end customers going towards paid eggs benedict and homemade croissants while middle- and lower-income consumers crowd the free buffet.

To be sure, Americans like their hotel breakfast. Among guests who partake of hotel food and beverage during their stay, the vast majority (78%) eat breakfast in the hotel, according to the 2025 JD Power North America Hotel Guest Satisfaction Study. Of that 78 percent, only 8 percent is paid, primarily at upper tier hotels where the trend is taking root. 

Andrea Stokes, hospitality practice lead at JD Power, said that data suggests guests continue to rate breakfast as an important part of their hotel stay. "This proportion is even higher at limited-service upper midscale and midscale hotel brands where complimentary breakfast is typically part of the hotel brand's standard offering," Stokes said. 

When JD Power asks upper midscale and midscale hotel guests to rate the importance of hotel features or amenities, about half (47%) rate complimentary breakfast as "need-to-have" (versus only nice-to-have). 

Mitchell Murray, CEO of Station House Inn and three other boutique hotels in Lake Tahoe, California, says while large chain hotels can offer economies of scale, free breakfast can account for roughly 5% of total revenue, closer to 6–7% once labor is included. "That's a meaningful cost, and many operators are asking, 'Does free breakfast actually generate 5% more revenue or bookings?' In many cases, the answer is no," Murray said. He added that when breakfast is free, quality often suffers — think mediocre coffee, watery eggs, frozen potatoes. "It's edible, but rarely memorable or value-adding," Murray said. 

One of Murray's properties is a Holiday Inn Express which he is transitioning to an independent hotel this year and where he plans to do away with the free breakfast after the change, once freed from corporate mandates. Major hotel brand franchisors have specific brand standards that franchisees must adhere to, and this includes food and beverage standards. 

Best Western, though, has no plans to unplug the waffle iron. "Offering a complimentary breakfast is an important part of our guest experience across much of our portfolio," said the hotel chain's CEO Larry Cuculic. "For travelers, free breakfast simplifies the stay, delivers meaningful value and influences booking and loyalty decisions, especially in the midscale and upper-midscale segments," Cuculic said. 

Cuculic says the economics still make sense: breakfast supports guest satisfaction and repeat business, by leveraging the purchasing power of its extensive hotel network, Best Western can help hotels manage costs while maintaining quality and consistency, "making breakfast both a friendly touchpoint for guests and a driver of long-term loyalty," he said. 

Holiday Inn Express is also standing by the free breakfast bar. "Breakfast plays a critical role in our value proposition and continues to be a major reason why travelers choose to stay with us – it's something they know, trust, and expect from our brand, "said Justin Alexander, vice president, global brand management for Holiday Inn Express, Staybridge Suites & Candlewood Suites. 

Hotel breakfast factors into the travel planning of Aimee Misovich and her family. The Holland, Michigan, resident said that her family are Hilton Honors members. "So we always stay at their properties — typically, Embassy Suites, Homewood or Hampton Inn. All three still offer free hotel breakfasts," Misovich said, adding that she likes the variety offered. 

"Homewoods began offering overnight oats and chia puddings. I do partake of the latter. Other times I'll just have a bagel with cream cheese, or a sausage patty inside a bagel for a breakfast sandwich of sorts," Misovich said. While she added that the quality can vary from property to property, the breakfasts are still appealing. 

"I certainly hope Hilton keeps their free breakfasts! After all, they're not really 'free'—I'm sure they're factored somehow into room prices," Misovich said. She also noted that foods she eats at hotel breakfasts are rarely ones she eats at home, "so they're a treat to me when we travel." 

The food and beverage offering, even if only for breakfast service, can be a key differentiator for limited-service hotel brands. "Any hotels that consider scaling back or eliminating free breakfast must focus on demonstrating value in other ways," Stokes said. 

Rita Chaddad, a faculty member who teaches courses on tourism and hospitality management at Columbia Southern University, predicts that free breakfast will continue to be eliminated in the luxury brands but remain in some form elsewhere, though travelers should expect more changes to come. 

"Breakfast is likely to remain, but the model may become more segmented," Chaddad said. In upper-midscale settings, hotels may be more willing to offer breakfast through credits, optional add-ons, or targeted inclusion — for example, through packages or loyalty benefits. "In these tiers, hotels may have more flexibility to replace 'free' with perceived value in other forms, provided it is communicated well and the guest feels the trade-off is fair," Chaddad said. 

But she added that many of the middle-tier hotels compete on simple, visible value, and breakfast is one of the clearest signals of that value, so there is risk of backlash if it is completely eliminated. "Removing it can create a perceived loss that may outweigh operational savings, even if the hotel's overall cost structure improves behind the scenes. For value-oriented travelers, breakfast is often interpreted as part of the 'deal,' and losing it can complicate the guest's mental math when comparing properties," Chaddad said. 

Chaddad said hotels will increasingly play with the offering, and beyond higher-tier hotels, travelers should be on the lookout for new models showing up as room-only versus breakfast-included choices, breakfast offered through packages or loyalty benefits, or other redesigned formats that control costs while keeping the benefit visible to guests. "The shift may be less about eliminating breakfast and more about adjusting who receives it, how it is delivered, and how clearly it is priced or bundled," she said.

While some of those changes may add to the hotel bottom line, they could come with an added emotional cost. "My kids and I would be really sad if they discontinue free hotel breakfasts. It's part of the fun of traveling," said East Tennessee resident Joanne Peterson.

Many European policymakers appear to still be smarting from U.S. Vice President JD Vance's tough words about the region at last year's Munich Security Conference.

So, it's perhaps not too surprising that U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's comments on Saturday at this year's event underscoring the U.S. and Europe's common heritage, goals and challenges have come as something of a relief in European capitals.

"[Rubio] delivered a speech which still assured us that we stand together in this partnership between Europe and the United States," German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul told CNBC in an interview on the sidelines of the conference. "Of course, there are some questions which we will have to discuss, but in the end of the day, his message was clear that we were so successful in the past, and we should do the job once again with new threats, with new tests in the 21st century."

On Saturday, Rubio said the U.S. has no intention of abandoning its deep alliance with Europe and wants the region to succeed.

"We want Europe to be strong," he told the gathering of defense and security officials in the German city. "We believe that Europe must survive, because the two great wars of the last century serve, for us, as history's great reminder, that ultimately, our destiny is, and will always be, intertwined with yours."

Contrast that to Vance's message to the same crowd last year, when he spoke of the "retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America." He lambasted his audience about the health of their democracies, their migration policies and freedom of speech.

While Rubio's tone might have been more conciliatory than Vance's, the underlying issues remained the same, as some conference attendees acknowledged.

"Of course, there were some issues he raised. We would answer differently when it comes to the migration problem, when it comes, of course, to question how we organize our legal framework here in Europe with regard to the digital services. And of course, also with the question of freedom of speech and so," Wadephul said.

U.S. President Donald Trump has frequently criticized Europe for its open migration policies, for being too reliant on the U.S. for its security and has pushed NATO allies to boost defense spending. His pursuit of ownership of Greenland, a Danish territory, has also rattled European leaders in recent months.

"The message we heard (from Rubio) is that America and Europe are intertwined, they have been in the past and will be in the future," the EU's chief diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said at a panel discussion on Sunday. "I think this is important. It is also clear that we don't see eye-to-eye in all the issues and that this will remain the case. But I think we can work from there."

A recurring theme at this year's event has been an earnest investigation into how Europe can stand on its own two feet, militarily and economically, in the face of challenges from Russia and China while the U.S. seeks to rework the global post-war order it created.

While European leaders acknowledge they must become less dependent on the U.S.'s security umbrella and markets, some bristle at the Trump administration's more confrontational approach compared to its predecessors.

"I think there were messages for us, and there were messages for the public in America, especially their constituents," Kallas said. "For me, every time I hear this European bashing, it's very in fashion right now, I'm thinking of what is the alternative?"

Others were even more critical of Rubio's comments.

"To be frank, I think the fact that we have, for Europeans, [been] asked to comment on the speech by the Americans, is already part of the problem," Benjamin Haddad, France's Minister Delegate for Europe, said at the same panel.

"We should not either be relieved or shocked by this or that speech. And I think the worst lesson we could draw from this weekend is to say 'I can cling to some love words I heard in part of his speech and push the snooze button.'" 

He said Europe should "just focus on ourselves, focus on what we can control. Focus on our rearmaments, on the support for Ukraine, and the threat that Russia poses to all of our democracies. Focus on competitiveness."

Wadephul told CNBC that work to become more independent is underway.

"But this is what we are doing on our own, and Europe has also learned that, of course, if you ask for more European sovereignty, you will receive it," he said.

"And that also means that, of course, we are more independent than we were in the past. And of course, we are looking for new global partners in the world which are willing to work together with Europe, for instance, Japan, India, Brazil and so on. So this is, I would say, if you are looking to a new global order, this means we keep our alliances, but additionally, we have new global partners, and this is a good future for Europe."

When Jesal Gadhia cofounded a software company a year ago, he expected that the AI agents it was creating would save its customers a lot of work.

He didn't predict the same tools would save his own team at the startup Cora so much time.

Agents wrote all of the code the company uses — something that wouldn't have been possible before last year, he told Business Insider.

The company's six-person team produced what Gadhia calls "unprecedented" amounts of code in its first 12 months. Five years ago, he said, reaching the same level of productivity would have required 20 to 30 engineers.

"It's been unlike any other time that I can remember," Gadhia said of the impact of agents.

Across tech, AI agents powered by large language models are absorbing tasks that experienced engineers once handled. Software engineering is becoming a human-AI partnership — what Anthropic chief Dario Amodei has called the industry's "centaur phase." And, as some tech insiders increasingly warn, what begins in software rarely stays there, with potential implications for other white-collar fields.

At Canva, the graphic design software company, engineering teams draft detailed instructions for AI agents to execute in the background — sometimes overnight. By morning, the work is ready, Brendan Humphreys, Canva's chief technology officer, said.

"Often, those results are really impressive," he told Business Insider.

Engineers still apply a "human touch" to reach the company's quality bar. Even so, agents are delivering "hours and hours and hours of work done completely autonomously," Humphreys said.

That's changing what it means to be a coder.

Humphreys said that his senior engineers now often describe their jobs as "largely review" — checking AI output, steering one or more agents to follow a plan, and taking responsibility for the final product.

Teams still spend time defining problems.

"The hardest part of engineering is to translate often vague, confusing, conflicting requirements into something that is production-ready," he said.

AI can help, but doing it well requires "precision of articulation" in what's required, Humphreys said. It also demands "mastery of the domain" so engineers can quickly verify that what AI produces is correct — and prevent unnecessary complexity from creeping into Canva's roughly 70 million lines of code, he said.

"These tools can have you in a jungle before you know it," Humphreys said of agents.

At Cora, Gadhia compares AI to a typewriter: It generates the code, freeing engineers to focus on "higher-level strategic architecture," meeting customers, and brainstorming features.

Cora builds agents that help software companies manage customer relationships. The agents take on tasks like gathering customer requirements, drafting presentations, and following up with clients, he said.

The AI will "run around, do all this work, and you can supervise them," said Gadhia, who is also the San Francisco company's chief technology officer.

Agents are also lowering technical barriers. Gadhia said Cora's CEO, who doesn't have a technical background, recently asked an agent to change the font on the company's website during a redesign. Minutes later, after an engineer reviewed the agent's work, the site was updated.

As agents handle more tasks — something that appeals to some, but rankles others — debate inside tech over AI has intensified.

Microsoft's AI chief, Mustafa Suleyman, warned in a recent interview that the technology will be able to handle "most, if not all, professional tasks" within 12 to 18 months. AI observers are divided over how disruptive the technology will ultimately be, with some forecasting a massive fallout for desk workers and others saying such fears are overblown.

Some investors are growing cautious. Stocks in industries potentially exposed to having AI wash over profit centers — from finance to software to legal services — have taken hits.

Even as agents become more powerful, they're unlikely to replace entire roles in various industries overnight. For one reason, technical challenges like hallucinations continue.

At the same time, many companies are still figuring out where AI fits into workflows, how workers should validate its output, and how organizations need to adapt, said Muqsit Ashraf, group chief executive of strategy at Accenture. There is often still a role for humans, he told Business Insider.

"Technology for the sake of technology doesn't help," Ashraf said.

Fewer than one in 10 organizations has redesigned jobs to support AI adoption, Accenture found in surveys of leaders and workers in 20 countries during the final months of 2025. That's despite the share of organizations using agents across multiple functions rising to 31% from 27% in a mid-2025 snapshot.

Alex Salazar, cofounder and CEO of AI infrastructure startup Arcade, said that to make the most of agents, workers should treat them like junior employees. That means telling the AI what to do, providing the criteria for success, and, if possible, providing examples.

Do those three things and "AI will sing for you," Salazar said.

He describes the workplace shift around AI bluntly. As it grows more capable, he said, workers such as software engineers will need to continually redefine their roles.

AI is "improving at an exponential rate," Salazar said. "And you, as a human, are not."

Iran is ready to consider compromises to reach a nuclear deal with the United States if Washington is willing to discuss lifting sanctions, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi told the BBC in an interview published on Sunday.

Iran has said it is prepared to discuss curbs on its nuclear program in return for the lifting of sanctions, but has repeatedly ruled out linking the issue to other questions including missiles.

Takht-Ravanchi confirmed that a second round of nuclear talks would take place on Tuesday in Geneva, after Tehran and Washington resumed discussions in Oman earlier this month. 

"(Initial talks went) more or less in a positive direction, but it is too early to judge," Takht-Ravanchi told the BBC.

A U.S. delegation, including envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, will meet with the Iranians on Tuesday morning, a source had told Reuters on Friday, with Omani representatives mediating the U.S.-Iran contacts.

Iran's atomic chief said on Monday the country could agree to dilute its most highly enriched uranium in exchange for all financial sanctions being lifted. Takht-Ravanchi used this example in the BBC interview to highlight Iran's flexibility.

The senior diplomat reiterated Tehran's stance that it would not accept zero uranium enrichment, which had been a key impediment to reaching a deal last year, with the U.S. viewing enrichment inside Iran as a pathway to nuclear weapons.

Iran denies seeking such nuclear weapons.

During his first term in office, Trump pulled the U.S. out of a 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the signature foreign policy achievement of former Democratic President Barack Obama.

The deal eased sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program to prevent it from being able to make an atomic bomb.

The off-again-on-again T20 World Cup cricket match between fierce rivals India and Pakistan is now confirmed to take place this Sunday, with the latter desperate for a win against the reigning champions in order to restore some national pride. Ahead of the most-anticipated match of the group stage, we explain below where to watch India vs. Pakistan in different locations around the world.

India are heavy favorites to sweep Pakistan aside in this grudge match in the neutral arena of the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Bad blood off the field spilled on to it in an ill-natured trio of matches during last year's Asia Cup and certainly won't have been helped by Pakistan's controversial decision to boycott this match — a decision it reversed only a few days ago.

It's hard to imagine a world where India don't have their hands on the trophy again when all is said and done on March 7. They excel all over the field, and the likes of spinners Varun Chakravarthy and Axar Patel and destructive batters like Suryakumar Yadav, Ishan Kishan, and Hardik Pandya are looking very hard to stop in conditions that suit their game perfectly. They have built up to this big-ticket game with comfortable wins over the USA and Namibia.

Pakistan almost suffered a shock loss first up against the Netherlands, but bounced back with a resounding win over the USA. Sahibzada Farhan is in a rich vein of form with the bat, while their quintet of spinners (Saim Ayub, Abrar Ahmed, Mohammad Nawaz, Shadab Khan, and Usman Tariq) have used some testing tracks to their advantage. It all sets up an intriguing contest this Sunday, which you can watch for free in some territories. Keep reading for all the information you need to watch India vs. Pakistan in the 2026 T20 World Cup.

Willow is the go-to streaming service for cricket fans in the US and has the rights to show every game of the 2026 T20 World Cup, including India vs. Pakistan. Willow is made available by some cable providers and as a standalone streaming platform for $10 a month or $80 a year. You can watch all the cricket carried by Willow thanks to Sling TV. Willow is one of the channels that make up its Desi Binge Plus and Dakshin Flex packages, both of which cost $10 a month and can be cancelled at any time. So that's all of the remaining games of the 2026 T20 World Cup for just $10!


                          For just the essentials without any extra fluff, Sling TV is the streaming service you're looking for. It's more customizable than other plans, with three options you can choose from, so you pay for only what you need. New members often get a chunky discount on their first month.
                        
                      

Sky Sports is the official broadcaster of the 2026 T20 World Cup in the UK, with India vs. Pakistan going out on its Sky Sports Cricket and Main Event channels. Sky TV packages that include sports channels start from £35 a month, or you can add them to an existing Sky plan for £20 a month. Not got Sky and don't want to be tied into a lengthy contract? A NOW Sports Membership gives you access to all of the Sky Sports channels for £15 a day or £35 a month on a rolling basis.

India vs. Pakistan will go out on Star Sports 1 on TV in India. Alternatively, to watch online, this T20 World Cup game will also be streamed through the JioHotstar app. JioHotstar plans cost from as little as ₹79 a month or ₹499 a year, while selected mobile phone plans include access for free.

While free-to-air PTV Sports and Geo Super are showing games on TV in Pakistan, the free Myco streaming platform will also have games online. All you need to do to watch India vs. Pakistan on Myco is sign up for a free account using your email address.

T20 World Cup 2026 coverage in Australia looks a little different to what cricket fans are used to, with Prime Video winning the rights to show every game of the tournament. That means to watch India vs. Pakistan, you'll need an Amazon Prime account. Anybody new to Prime will be able to watch absolutely free, thanks to the service's 30-day trial. After that, subscriptions continue from $10 a month or $80 a year, although you can cancel any time during the 30-day trial.

While the 2026 T20 World Cup is being shown by domestic broadcasters in various countries around the world, the organizer's own ICC.TV streaming platform will show free streams in more than 100 other countries. That's everywhere from Albania to Vietnam, and includes several competing nations such as Afghanistan, Italy, Nepal, and the Netherlands.

AI fatigue won't hit everyone the same way, AI researcher Gary Marcus said.

"In some domains, AI might actually make a person's job more fun," Marcus told Business Insider.

Software engineers are increasingly discussing how AI is draining them. Siddhant Khare, who builds AI tools, recently wrote about how he's experiencing AI fatigue.

"If someone who builds agent infrastructure full-time can burn out on AI, it can happen to anyone," Khare wrote.

Marcus said that not all industries are set to be disrupted in the same way AI has upended programming and engineering.

"If somebody needs to do some artistic work and they don't really have artistic talent, it might be fun to get the system to make them feel like they have a superpower," he said.

However, Marcus said he isn't surprised that programmers are beginning to feel fatigued.

"Some people in coding, in particular, probably feel like constant pressure, and now they feel like what they're doing is debugging somebody else's code, instead of writing code," he said. "Debugging somebody else's code is not particularly fun."

The feeling Marcus described echoed what Khare told Business Insider when asked to expand on his AI fatigue.

"We used to call it an engineer, now it is like a reviewer," Khare said. "Every time it feels like you are a judge at an assembly line and that assembly line is never-ending."

Steve Yegge, a veteran engineer, said companies should limit employees' time spent on AI-assisted work to 3 hours. He said AI has "a vampiric effect."

"I seriously think founders and company leaders and engineering leaders at all levels, all the way down to line managers, have to be aware of this and realize that you might only get three productive hours out of a person who's vibe coding at max speed," Yegge told The "Pragmatic Engineer" newsletter/podcast. "So, do you let them work for three hours a day? The answer is yes, or your company's going to break."

AI disruption jitters have ripped through global stock markets over the last couple of weeks, with sectors across the spectrum ending up in the crosshairs of investors looking to bet on which industry could be upended by the inevitable wave of agentic AI. 

There will almost certainly be more of these moments this week, as some of the biggest names in AI take to the stage at an event in India. 

Looking back at last week's volatility could gives some clues for the trading week ahead, as the impact of a series of announcements from US-based AI giants played out from sector to sector, but also across the Atlantic. 

In Europe, software companies suffered, including Dassault Systemes which saw its share post the biggest ever one-day drop, and RELX, a British analytics group which recorded its worst session decline since 1988. 

Wealth managers also came under pressure, with names like St James's Place, Aberdeen Group and Quilter all nursing deep losses. 

In a recent note, UBS analysts said they believe that the AI-driven sell off reflects a "growing disruption is accelerating well beyond software," warning that markets have only partially priced in the credit implications. The Swiss bank expects this risk to increase throughout 2026 and into 2027 in the U.S. and to a lesser extent in Europe. 

On the other side of the debate, Dan Ives of Wedbush told Squawk Box Europe that the "software Armageddon is overblown," saying that stalwarts like Salesforce and ServiceNow will be core participants of the AI revolution, rather than cannibalized by it. 

This will all come sharply into focus this week as India prepares to host one of the year's most significant AI summits. When the organizers called the event in New Delhi the "AI Impact Summit", they may not have known how literally the markets would be taking that at this very moment in time. 

The event has attracted thousands of attendees and the line-up does not disappoint. Headliners include Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Microsoft's Brad Smith, Mistral AI co-Founder Arthur Mensch and Meta's Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang. CNBC's Arjun Kharpal, who will be covering the event, says to "expect a number of big deals, partnerships and customer announcements from tech companies in the India market. Think cloud deals, AI infrastructure and collaborations between government and tech firms. Tech giants are attracted to the large, tech-forward customer base that India presents as well as the huge pool of engineering talent. So expect Prime Minister Modi to roll out the red carpet to Big Tech and all the executives will be more than happy to walk down it."

Oops, something went wrong

Never miss an important update on your stock portfolio and cut through the noise. Over 7 million investors trust Simply Wall St to stay informed where it matters for FREE.

If you are wondering whether CleanSpark's current share price lines up with its underlying value, this article will walk through the key signals without the noise.

The stock recently closed at US$9.85, with returns of a 2.3% decline over 7 days, 26.3% decline over 30 days, 14.7% decline year to date and 6.2% decline over 1 year, set against a very large 3 year return.

Recent news coverage has focused on how bitcoin mining companies are reacting to changing market conditions and capital needs, which helps frame sentiment around CleanSpark. For investors, this context can be useful when weighing whether recent price swings reflect shorter term mood shifts or longer term business factors.

CleanSpark currently has a valuation score of 2 out of 6. Next, we will look at what different valuation methods say about the stock, before finishing with a more rounded way to think about value beyond the usual models.

CleanSpark scores just 2/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown.

The DCF model estimates what a company could be worth by projecting future cash flows and discounting them back to today, allowing a comparison between that value and the current share price.

For CleanSpark, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach, based on cash flows in US$. The latest twelve month free cash flow is a loss of $1,423.62 million. Looking ahead, the model uses analyst input where available, including a projected free cash flow of $109 million in 2026 and $8 million in 2027, then extends further years using its own extrapolations. By 2035, the extrapolated free cash flows in the model are close to zero, with small positive and negative figures.

After discounting all these projected cash flows back to today, the estimated intrinsic value comes out at roughly US$0.41 per share. Compared with the recent share price of US$9.85, this DCF output suggests the stock is trading at a level that is significantly higher than the model's estimated intrinsic value.

Result: OVERVALUED

Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests CleanSpark may be overvalued by 2316.3%. Discover 53 high quality undervalued stocks or create your own screener to find better value opportunities.

Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for CleanSpark.

The preferred multiple here is the P/S ratio, which can be useful for companies where revenue is a clearer anchor than profits, especially if earnings are volatile or negative. It lets you see how much investors are currently paying for each dollar of sales.

In general, higher growth expectations and lower perceived risk tend to support a higher "normal" or "fair" P/S ratio. Slower expected growth or higher risk usually point to a lower one. So context around the business and its industry really matters.

CleanSpark currently trades on a P/S ratio of 3.21x. That sits a little below the Software industry average of 3.60x and well below the peer group average of 24.10x. Simply Wall St's Fair Ratio for CleanSpark is 3.11x, which is its proprietary estimate of what the P/S could be given factors such as growth profile, industry, profit margin, market cap and key risk indicators.

This Fair Ratio aims to be more tailored than a simple comparison with peers or the broad industry, because it adjusts for company specific traits instead of assuming all software names deserve the same multiple. With the current P/S at 3.21x versus a Fair Ratio of 3.11x, the gap is small, suggesting the valuation is close to what the model would expect.

Result: ABOUT RIGHT

P/S ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Start investing in legacies, not executives. Discover our 23 top founder-led companies.

Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation. On Simply Wall St you can use Narratives, where you set out your story for a company like CleanSpark, link that story to specific forecasts for revenue, earnings and margins, and then see a Fair Value that updates automatically when new information such as news or earnings arrives. This makes it easy to compare that Fair Value to the current price and decide what action, if any, makes sense for you, whether you lean closer to a very optimistic view that supports a Fair Value of US$30.00 or you are more cautious and prefer something nearer US$14.69, both of which you can explore and customise within the Community page alongside other investors' views.

The Centre on Sunday launched a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)-based public distribution system (PDS) in Gujarat's Gandhinagar.



Union Consumer Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi said the introduction of CBDC in the PDS marks a significant milestone towards ensuring transparency, efficiency, and beneficiary empowerment in India's food security architecture.



He said India's PDS—the largest food distribution system in the world serving more than 80 crore beneficiaries—continues to evolve through technology-driven reforms.



Giving the slogan “Har Dana, Har Rupiya, Har Adhikar”, the minister said the initiative will enhance awareness of entitlements, simplify access, and strengthen accountability in the delivery of subsidised foodgrains.

Joshi said under the CBDC framework, digital coupons generated through the Reserve Bank of India will be credited directly to beneficiaries as programmable digital currency.



“Beneficiaries can redeem their entitled quantity of foodgrains at Fair Price Shops (FPS) using CBDC coupon or voucher codes. The system will address challenges related to biometric authentication and e-POS operational issues while ensuring secure, traceable, and real-time transactions. The pilot will soon be expanded to the Union Territories of Chandigarh, Puducherry, and Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu,” he added.

Speaking on the occasion, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said the CBDC pilot represents an important extension of the digital India vision into the public distribution system.

Over the past several years, the Department of Food and Public Distribution has undertaken extensive digital transformation of India's food security ecosystem. Key initiatives include end-to-end digitisation of ration cards and nationwide portability under the One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) framework, deployment of e-POS devices for Aadhaar-enabled authentication and real-time transaction capture, and implementation of data-driven validation through the Rightful Targeting Dashboard.

The Tribune, now published from Chandigarh, started publication on February 2, 1881, in Lahore (now in Pakistan). It was started by Sardar Dyal Singh Majithia, a public-spirited philanthropist, and is run by a trust comprising five eminent persons as trustees.The Tribune, the largest selling English daily in North India, publishes news and views without any bias or prejudice of any kind. Restraint and moderation, rather than agitational language and partisanship, are the hallmarks of the newspaper. It is an independent newspaper in the real sense of the term.The Tribune has two sister publications, Punjabi Tribune (in Punjabi) and Dainik Tribune (in Hindi).

In January 2022, when the world was still in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic and coping with rolling lockdowns, non-fungible tokens were all the rage.

The blockchain-based assets, which more often than not took the form of cartoon pictures of silly-looking avatars like “CryptoPunks” to “Pudgy Penguins,” were selling like hot cakes. Even big shot celebrities were lining up to secure NFTs belonging to once-popular collections, like Yuga Labs' Bored Ape Yacht Club.

In the midst of the craze, pop sensation Justin Bieber shelled out a hefty $1.3 million for a Bored Ape, an enormous sum of money for the rights to an image of a particularly glum-looking ape that appears to be on the verge of tears for some unknown reason.

Unsurprisingly, the questionable splurge turned out to be a hilariously bad investment. As Benzinga reports, the ape is now worth a measly $12,000, meaning that it's lost over 99 percent of its value over the last three and change years.

The controversial crypto market has been going through an “NFT winter” following a brutal and extended crash. Collectors have gotten a hefty reality check. Who could've seen that coming?

Yuga Labs, the creator of the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection, has been holding on to dear life. The company has gone through several rounds of layoffs since the trend's heyday, with Yuga Labs cofounder Greg Solano admitting in April 2024 that the company had “lost its way.”

In one particularly bizarre incident, partiers at a Bored Ape Yacht Club event in Hong Kong were alarmed after their eyes started burning, which later turned out to be caused by the event's excessive use of UV light.

The company has also had to deal with a class action lawsuit that accused it of using celebrity endorsements to sell an unregistered security. The Securities Exchange Commission started an investigation into Yuga Labs in 2022, which concluded in March of last year, two months into Trump's second term. The regulator's takeaway was that NFTs weren't securities after all. However, being let off the hook by regulators hasn't exactly improved the situation, as more and more collectors are abandoning their NFTs.

Despite waning demand, Yuga Labs isn't ready to call it quits. Earlier this year, the company announced it was looking to open an IRL Bored Ape clubhouse in Miami, featuring NFT galleries, event spaces, and “exclusive content” only members can explore.

But whether it can ever reignite the enormous amount of enthusiasm the trend once drew remains unclear at best.

While Bieber remains the proud owner of Bored Ape Yacht Club #3001, others are looking to cut their losses.

Gandhinagar (Gujarat) [India], February 15 (ANI): Union Home and Cooperation Minister Amit Shah launched the nation's first Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)-based transparent, modern and user-friendly Public Distribution System in Gandhinagar.

Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel, Union Minister for Food and Public Distribution Pralhad Joshi and Deputy Chief Minister Harsh Sanghavi graced the event held at Mahatma Mandir.

On this occasion, Union Home Minister Amit Shah launched the distribution of chickpeas and tur dal in 1 kg sealed packets, inaugurated the Annapurti Grain ATM facility in the Sabarmati zone of Ahmedabad, and initiated the ''Garima Poshan - Suposhit Garudeshwar Taluka' campaign, according to the Gujarat Chief Minister's office (CMO). 

Furthermore, in the presence of the dignitaries, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the Food and Civil Supplies Department and the Consumer Education and Research Centre (CERC) to safeguard consumer interests. This MoU will establish a pre-litigation grievance redressal ecosystem to ensure issues are resolved before reaching the courts.

Furthermore, the Food and Civil Supplies Department signed an MoU with CARE Ratings and the Consumer Education and Research Centre (CERC) to develop a 'Consumer Responsibility Index' (CRI).

On the launch of various projects to digitise and make the Public Distribution System more transparent, HM Amit Shah extended greetings to the nation on Maha Shivratri. The CMO stated that, inspired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the expansion of 'Digital India' has now reached the Public Distribution System. 

He further noted that a decade ago, nearly 60 crore people in the country did not have bank accounts in their families. However, under the Prime Minister's leadership, India has emerged as a global leader in digital transactions, with nearly half of the world's total digital transactions taking place in India.

Speaking further on digital transformation, HM Shri Amit Shah said that technology-driven reform is now becoming a reality in delivering affordable food grains to the poor. Under this initiative, modern systems such as the CBDC project and the 'Made in Gujarat' Annapurti Grain ATM have been made operational.

The CMO stated that he emphasised that this new technology-based framework will eliminate corruption and remove middlemen, ensuring that citizens in remote villages, districts, and backward regions receive their full food grain entitlements directly and transparently.

Congratulating all participating institutions as well as the Central and State departments associated with the CBDC project, HM Amit Shah said that this modern system truly embodies the Prime Minister's mantra of 'Minimum Government, Maximum Governance.'

He further stated that under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana, 81 crore people across the country are currently receiving free rations from the government. This food security framework has now become digital and transparent.

Referring to the Grain ATM, the Annapurti machine, the new pulses packaging initiative, and the Garima Poshan campaign launched during the program, HM Amit Shah termed them as revolutionary initiatives in providing food security to the poor.

Elaborating further, Amit Shah stated that the Annapurti machine will enable the distribution of 25 kg of grain in just 35 seconds, ensuring complete accuracy in weight, value, and quality.

He added that this system, integrated with the Aadhaar-based biometric mechanism, CBDC, and the payment system of the Reserve Bank of India, will be implemented nationwide over the next three to four years. As a result, beneficiaries across the country will receive their entitled quality rations conveniently and with full transparency.

Highlighting the impact of welfare initiatives, Amit Shah stated that under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the holistic development of the poor and every citizen has been ensured through the effective implementation of numerous schemes. He noted that over the past decade, the construction of 4 crore houses under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, Nal se Jal connections in 13 crore households, LPG connections in around 13 crore homes under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, toilets in 12 crore households under the Swachh Bharat Mission, and 2.91 crore women becoming 'Lakhpati Didis' reflect the success of the government's initiatives, the CMO stated. 

Emphasising the protection of farmers and cattle-rearers, Amit Shah stated that under the leadership of the Prime Minister, the government has remained steadfast in its commitment to farmer welfare.

He said that over the past decade, procurement of food grains from farmers at Minimum Support Price (MSP) has increased fifteenfold, while the agriculture budget has increased from Rs 26,000 crore to Rs 1,29,000 crore.

He further noted that in International Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), India's dairy, agriculture, and fisheries sectors have been provided comprehensive protection, thereby ensuring security for domestic producers while also opening global markets for Indian products.

UHM Shri Amit Shah congratulated Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel, Union Minister Pralhad Joshi, and the Government of Gujarat for choosing Gujarat for the CBDC-based transparent distribution system for this pilot project. He described this leak-proof model as a blueprint for a Viksit Bharat.

On this occasion, Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel stated that under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the guidance of HM Amit Shah, a new chapter in public welfare is being written with the mantra of 'Je Kahevu Te Karvu.'

He added that the Prime Minister has laid a strong foundation for a Viksit Bharat through GYAN--empowering the GYAN --Garib (the Poor), Yuva (Youth), Annadata (Farmers), and Mahila (Women). 

Referring to the transformative power of technology, CM said that overcoming earlier doubts about digital payments, India has today established itself as the world's largest user of UPI.

He noted that Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT), Jan Dhan, Aadhaar, and Mobile--strengthened further by AI-based database connectivity--have ensured that the benefits of government schemes reach beneficiaries directly and transparently.

Focusing on the four pillars of food, housing, health, and income security, he added, has enabled nearly 25 crore people in the country to rise above the poverty line over the past decade.

CM said that 'Grain ATMs' will now be made operational across the state for the distribution of food grains. Through these ATMs, 25 kg of grain can be dispensed in just 35 seconds, and the machines will function around the clock.

He added that this facility will enable workers and members of the labour class to collect wheat, rice, and pulses entitled under the National Food Security Act at their convenience, even after working hours, marking a significant step toward empowering each citizen.

Speaking about the CBDC-based Public Distribution System, the CM said this technology will provide beneficiaries with precise information on subsidies, product weights, and pricing via digital tokens.

He emphasised that digital tracking and real-time monitoring will ensure complete transparency in the delivery of benefits, thereby fulfilling the government's commitment to a 'saturation approach'--reaching every eligible beneficiary without exception.

CM expressed confidence that after recently connecting cattle-rearers with AI-driven solutions through Amul, this technology-based initiative in the Public Distribution System would also prove to be a milestone.

He added that, following the Prime Minister's mantra of 'Sewa hi Sadhana,' the state government is steadfastly progressing toward the vision of a 'Viksit Bharat from Viksit Gujarat' @2047, ensuring that technology delivers benefits to the last person in society.

Extending greetings on the occasion of Maha Shivratri, Pralhad Joshi, Union Minister for Food and Public Distribution, said that under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the CBDC-based initiative is not merely a technology app or portal, but a transformative step that will secure the rightful access to food grains for nearly 80 crore needy beneficiaries, the CMO said. 

He stated that this innovative initiative will further strengthen the world's largest food security program, which is being implemented under the Prime Minister's guidance. He added that integrating advanced technology into the grain distribution system was once a major challenge, but under the 'Digital India' campaign, this task has become significantly easier and more efficient.

He stated that with the nationwide digitisation of ration cards, the vision of 'One Nation, One Ration Card' has been successfully realised. Through digital coupons introduced under the initiative of the Reserve Bank of India, beneficiaries can collect food grains at any time by simply scanning a QR code at a Grain ATM.

He added that even beneficiaries with basic mobile phones will be able to access the facility, as the system will enable grain distribution via OTP verification sent via SMS.

The implementation of this technology has led to the cancellation of nearly 2 to 3 crore fake ration cards, ensuring greater integrity in the system. With the launch of the CBDC-based framework, only genuine beneficiaries will be able to access the benefits.

Since the digital entitlement for food grains will be credited directly to the beneficiary's wallet, it can be used exclusively for purchasing grain from fair price shops and Grain ATMs, preventing misuse elsewhere.

The introduction of this digital grain distribution model in Gujarat is expected to create a positive ripple effect across other states, helping to eliminate duplicate ration cards and further strengthen transparency nationwide.

Union Minister said that the CBDC-based affordable grain distribution system will stand as a 'Digital Satyagraha' against poverty on the banks of the Sabarmati River. He said this initiative will help curb black marketing and ensure that food grains reach needy beneficiaries swiftly and transparently.

The Minister added that this innovative model will be expanded nationwide in the coming years.

Deputy Chief Minister Harsh Sanghavi stated that the nation's digital currency will help ensure food reaches the plates of the poor. He remarked that a new chapter of history is being written once again on the soil of Gujarat.

He added that the country is on the verge of witnessing a transformative revolution that will redefine and strengthen the Public Distribution System, not only in Gujarat but across India.

Deputy CM added that ensuring food security has long been a significant challenge in a vast country like India. In the past, issues such as middlemen and long queues at ration shops often delayed the delivery of government grain to beneficiaries. He emphasised that the CBDC-based Public Distribution System project will provide a lasting solution to these challenges.

He said that traditionally, the initial benefits of new technologies have often reached large industrialists first. However, under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and the guidance of HM Amit Shah, India has charted a new course--where modern innovations like Digital Currency are being used first to ensure food reaches the plates of the poor.

He stated that beneficiaries will no longer have to wait for shopkeepers, as they can collect their entitled grain from a Grain ATM at any time, 24 hours a day, within just five minutes. The system guarantees precision, with not even a one-gram variation in weight, making it a strong example of 'Digital India' in action.

He added that Gujarat's forward-looking model--integrating CBDC, Grain ATMs, and biometric-based systems--will serve as a guiding framework for the entire nation, ensuring that the rightful beneficiary receives their due transparently and without inconvenience.

In her welcome address, Mona Khandhar, Additional Chief Secretary of the Food and Civil Supplies Department, provided detailed insights into the entire program and its innovative initiatives. She stated that under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India is steadily advancing toward a digital revolution.

She added that with the introduction of India's Central Bank Digital Currency--e-Rupee--a new era of modern fintech has begun in the country, and Gujarat is poised to take a leading role in this transformation.

The event was attended by Union Minister of State for Food and Public Distribution, Nimuben Bambhaniya, Gujarat's Minister for Food and Civil Supplies; Ramanbhai Solanki, Minister of State; P.C. Baranda, Mayor of Gandhinagar; Miraben Patel, various MPs and MLAs, Secretary of the Department of Food and Public Distribution of the Government of India, Sanjeev Chopra, Executive Director of the Reserve Bank of India, P. Vasudevan, Executive Director of Punjab National Bank-PNB D. Surendran, along with central and state government officials, other dignitaries, and a large number of beneficiaries, the CMO noted.

A divergence in global bitcoin BTC$68,559.60 market sentiment is widening as U.S. institutional investors hold steady while offshore traders retreat from their positions.

The gap is clearest in futures markets. CME, the go-to platform for hedge funds and institutional desks in the U.S., shows traders are still paying a premium to stay long on bitcoin, according to NYDIG's head of research, Greg Cipolaro.

This is evident on a one-month annualized basis, essentially the markup for futures over spot prices, which remains higher than on its offshore counterpart, Deribit. 

“The more pronounced drop in offshore basis suggests reduced appetite for leveraged long exposure,” Cipolaro wrote. “The widening spread between CME and Deribit basis functions as a real-time gauge of geographical risk appetite.”

Bitcoin earlier this month fell to $60,000 before rebounding. Some pinned the selloff on rising concerns that quantum computing will undermine the system's cryptographic security. NYDIG found that the numbers don't back up that explanation.

For one, bitcoin's performance has closely tracked that of publicly traded quantum-computing companies like IONQ Inc. (IONQ) and D-Wave Quantum Inc. (QBTS). If quantum risk were truly weighing on crypto, those stocks would be rising while bitcoin falls.

Instead, they dropped together, pointing to a broader decline in appetite for long-term, future-driven assets. On top of that, search data on Google Trends shows interest for “quantum computing bitcoin” rises when the price of BTC rises.

The most noteworthy cryptocurrency developments in the region this week came from Argentina, Brazil, and El Salvador. 

El Salvador is planning a $100 million tokenised investment program for local SMEs, Brazil is considering a bill to eliminate crypto taxes and establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, and Argentina's fintech industry suffered a blow when lawmakers revoked a proposal that would have permitted salaries to be paid into digital wallets.

Together, these tales demonstrate how governments and businesses in Latin America are experimenting with new models for reserves, investments, and daily financial access, making the region a crucial arena for crypto policy and innovation.

Fintech setback in Argentina's salary deposit reform

A proposed labour reform that would have enabled employees to receive their salaries directly in digital wallets for the first time was initially embraced by Argentina's fintech industry. 

But ultimately, lawmakers eliminated the clause, which was generally interpreted as supporting traditional banks. 

Even if surveys indicate that a significant majority of Argentines prefer the right to choose where their paychecks are deposited, the party of President Javier Milei agreed to remove the clause during discussions to gain wider support for the law.

Employees are required by law to receive their pay through conventional bank accounts. 

Nevertheless, the use of digital wallets has increased recently, in part because financial services are more difficult to use.

Only 47% of Argentines have a bank account, according to a 2022 central bank survey. 

This indicates a long-standing mistrust of the institution following incidents like the 2001 “corralito,” ongoing inflation, and frequent limitations on accessing funds.

Fintech platforms have thereby made financial access more widely available, with many users turning to apps like Mercado Pago, Modo, Ualá, and Lemon as their main gateway to official digital finance.

Brazil considers a strategic Bitcoin reserve and crypto tax exemption

A report presented to the Chamber of Deputies Economic Development Committee in Brazil has the potential to drastically alter the nation's stance on Bitcoin.

 The plan calls for removing taxes on cryptocurrency gains and establishing a Sovereign Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (RESBit). 

The new language proposed by Congressman Luiz Gastão, rapporteur of Bill 4,501/2024, will modify the regulation of the cryptocurrency industry, including modifications to oversight and reporting guidelines.

The plan would permit the federal government to buy Bitcoin over time, up to a maximum of 5% of the country's foreign exchange holdings. 

The Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank would work together to handle the assets, which would be kept in cold wallets for further security. 

Additionally, the law repeals an existing rule requiring brokers and investors to register all cryptocurrency transactions and permits the payment of federal taxes in Bitcoin. 

Bitcoin is positioned as a strategic reserve that might underpin Brazil's digital currency, the Drex, and it also offers a complete income-tax exemption on gains from Bitcoin and other digital assets.

Strategic alliance aims to tokenize $100 million for Salvadoran SMEs

In order to direct $100 million in foreign direct investment into small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) in El Salvador by 2026, Corporación Infinito (COIN) and Stakiny formed a strategic alliance. 

Through an integrated infrastructure that blends financial structuring, regulatory compliance, and blockchain technology, the effort intends to employ regulated tokenised equity instruments to link local businesses with global finance. 

The project aims to draw in institutional investors and foreign money seeking to use digital investment methods to contribute to the expansion of Salvadoran firms, according to Antonio Arrué, vice president of COIN.

Stakiny, a platform requesting permission from the National Commission of Digital Assets to tokenise equity in private enterprises, will supply the technological backbone. 

In order to provide real-time cap table management, dividend distribution, governance events, and secondary trading, the model will connect conventional shareholder agreements with digital tokens registered on-chain.

 To enable tokenised investing for both crypto-native and conventional investors, the platform is made to run on an EVM-compatible network and be accessed via a mobile wallet with biometric authentication.

Payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP XRP$1.4904 is rising faster than bitcoin BTC$68,559.60 and ether ETH$2,067.21 as investors hunt for bargains following a price crash earlier this month.

XRP's price has rallied 38% to $1.55 since hitting a low on Feb. 6, according to CoinDesk data. The price has jumped by more than 5% in the past 24 hours alone.

This performance puts it well ahead of both bitcoin and ether, which have gained roughly 15% since Feb. 6. Bitcoin and ether recently changed hands at $69,420 and $2,020, respectively.

XRP's bitcoin-beating rally tracks signs of dip-buying on Binance following the crash. CryptoQuant data indicates Binance's XRP reserves dropped by 192.37 million XRP to 2.553 billion between Feb. 7 and 9. The 7% slide marked the lowest level since January 2024, and holdings have remained stable since then.

Analysts typically associate a drop in exchange balances with investor accumulation. The logic is that investors prefer to take direct custody of coins rather than keep them on exchanges when they plan to hold them long-term.

Sudden, sharp withdrawals can reduce available supply, opening the door to a price rally. Historical trends reinforce this view. XRP rallied sharply from $0.60 to over $2.40 in the final two months of 2024 as the balance held on exchanges slid faster.

India accounts for more than half of the world's total digital transactions, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said on Sunday while launching the country's first Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)-based Public Distribution System (PDS) in Gujarat's Gandhinagar.

 

Speaking at a function held at Mahatma Mandir, HM Shah said India's rapid digital transformation over the past decade had enabled the government to integrate advanced technology into welfare delivery.  

 

"A decade ago, nearly 60 crore people in the country did not have bank accounts. Today, India is leading the world in digital transactions, and more than half of the global digital transactions are taking place in India," he said, extending greetings on the occasion of Mahashivratri.  

 

He inaugurated a transparent and technology-driven PDS based on CBDC, integrated with Aadhaar-based biometric authentication and the Reserve Bank's payment systems.  

 

HM Shah said the initiative would remove leakages in subsidised food grain distribution. “With a technology-based system like CBDC, corruption and the role of middlemen will be completely eliminated,” he said, adding that the model would be implemented nationwide within the next three to four years.  

 

The programme included the launch of the 'Annapurti' Grain ATM in the Sabarmati zone of Ahmedabad, which can dispense 25 kilograms of food grains within 35 seconds with accuracy in weight, price and quality.  

 

Distribution of 'chana' and 'tur' dal in sealed one-kilogram packs was also introduced, along with the ‘Garima Poshan – Suposhit Garudeshwar Taluka' campaign.  

 

The Union Minister said that under the 'Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana', 81 crore people are receiving free ration and that digitisation would make the system more transparent.  

 

He also referred to welfare initiatives undertaken over the past decade, stating that four crore houses had been constructed under the 'Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana', tap water connections provided to 13 crore households, gas cylinders to around 13 crore homes and toilets built in 12 crore households.  

 

He added that 2.91 crore women had become 'Lakhpati Didis', reflecting broader efforts at inclusive development.  

 

Gujarat Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel said the integration of Jan Dhan accounts, Aadhaar and mobile connectivity had enabled direct transfer of benefits to eligible citizens.  

 

He stated that the Grain ATM would operate round the clock, allowing beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act to collect wheat, rice and pulses at their convenience.  

 

"Through digital tokens under the CBDC system, beneficiaries will receive precise information about subsidy, quantity and price, ensuring full transparency," he said.  

 

Union Minister for Food and Public Distribution Pralhad Joshi said the initiative was aimed at safeguarding the rights of nearly 80 crore beneficiaries.  

 

He said digitisation of ration cards had enabled the 'One Nation, One Ration Card' framework and that beneficiaries could access food grains by scanning QR codes at Grain ATMs or through SMS-based OTP verification.  

 

"With the implementation of this technology, an estimated two to three crore fake ration cards have been cancelled," he said, adding that the digital amount credited to beneficiaries' wallets could only be used to purchase subsidised grains.  

 

Deputy Chief Minister Harsh Sanghavi said the system would reduce queues at ration shops and allow beneficiaries to collect food grains at any time. "There will not be even a one-gram difference in weight," he said.  

 

During the event, Memoranda of Understanding were signed between the Food and Civil Supplies Department and the Consumer Education and Research Centre to establish a pre-litigation grievance redressal mechanism.  

 

Separate agreements were also signed with Care Ratings and the Consumer Education and Research Centre to develop a Consumer Responsibility Index aimed at strengthening accountability in the public distribution system.

Ethereum's native token, Ether (ETH), faces a fresh downside test as a bear pennant tightens on the daily chart and a major whale shifts size to Binance.

ETH price saw a sharp February drop from above $2,800 to the $1,900–$2,000 area, creating the flagpole.

It has since compressed into a narrowing triangle, printing lower highs and slightly higher lows, a classic bear pennant that often breaks in the direction of the prior move.

The trend context stays weak. Ethereum price remains below its 50-day and 200-day EMAs, which now act as overhead resistance. RSI has bounced off its lows but still sits below the neutral 50 level, signaling that buyers have not regained control.

A breakdown below pennant support near $1,950 would confirm bearish continuation.

The measured-move target from the flagpole points to roughly $1,200, implying about 40% downside from current levels. A sustained breakout above pennant resistance would invalidate the setup.

On-chain data tracked by Arkham shows wallets labeled “Garrett Jin” depositing 261,024 ETH (around $543 million) to Binance in several large tranches over minutes.

Arkham's label does not confirm the wallet owner's real-world identity, but it flags a cluster of addresses believed to be controlled by the same entity.

Transfers of this size to a centralized exchange typically raise sell-pressure risk because they move supply closer to spot liquidity, even if selling does not occur immediately.

Traders will watch whether the deposited ETH begins to distribute across exchange wallets or stays idle.

Visible sell-side activity would add pressure to an already bearish chart setup, while a lack of follow-through could limit downside and trigger a short-covering bounce if positioning turns too one-sided.

Adding to the bearish setup, ETF flow data suggests the bid underneath crypto has thinned.

Glassnode shows the 30-day moving average of net flows for Ethereum spot ETFs has been negative for most of the past 90 days, with little evidence of a turn higher.

Persistent outflows don't guarantee immediate selling in ETH, but they do signal muted institutional demand, making it harder for prices to absorb large exchange deposits or sustain rebounds.

The Motley Fool->



Both HODL and ETHA charge the same expense ratio, while HODL has a slightly greater one-year price decline. 

Since both ETFs' inception in 2024, HODL has increased by 40%, while ETHA has moved 40% in the opposite direction. 

Both the VanEck Bitcoin ETF (NYSEMKT:HODL) and the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (NASDAQ:ETHA) are designed for investors seeking direct exposure to the price movements of leading cryptocurrencies without owning the tokens themselves. This comparison focuses on their costs, performance, risk, and structural differences to help clarify which may appeal more to those weighing Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) versus Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH) exposure.



The 1-yr return represents total return over the trailing 12 months. 



Both have similar expense ratios and one-year price declines, but HODL's smaller assets under management (AUM) may matter for investors who prioritize scale. 





HODL was launched by VanEck on Jan. 4, 2024, and only holds Bitcoin. Six months later, BlackRock launched ETHA, which only holds Ether. Both funds offer direct exposure to the crypto market and share high volatility. 



For more guidance on ETF investing, check out the full guide at this link. 



Both Bitcoin and Ethereum posted negative returns in 2025, marking the first annual decline since 2022. It was a wake-up call for many investors who thought the returns on Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies would be endless. Although governments and institutional entities continue to invest in the crypto space, it will still experience ups and downs just like the stock market. 

Cryptocurrency should also not be viewed as a reliable hedge against the U.S. dollar, despite the impact of tariffs and geopolitical tensions on the fiat currency. 

With that being said, investors must be cautious when investing in crypto-holding funds, as even though people may not have to worry about digital wallet hacks, the market is very volatile, and it will directly impact the performance of funds such as HODL and ETHA.

Throughout the entire existence of both funds, HODL has increased nearly 40%, while ETHA has fallen 41%, but it's still too soon to say whether HODL will perform better than ETHA over the long term. For now, though, HODL shows better promise and holds a cryptocurrency that's much more included in institutional and government development than Ether.

Crypto is no longer just an asset class, it is also an ever-more critical part of financial infrastructure, says Steve Kurz, Galaxy Digital's (GLXY) global head of asset management and co-head of digital assets 

In “The Great Convergence,” the company's 2026 investment outlook, Kurz sets out a plan that's pragmatic about what can be done now while staying optimistic about the big picture in the long run.

The defining story of this cycle, he argues, is the asset-to-infrastructure transformation.

"The convergence of traditional financial rails with crypto infrastructure represents a significant and durable market structure evolution for global financial services," Kurz told CoinDesk in an interview. 

Galaxy Digital, a digital asset financial services and investment firm founded in 2018 by Michael Novogratz, functions as a bridge between traditional finance and the expanding cryptocurrency ecosystem. It offers institutional-grade trading, asset management, investment banking, custody, mining and infrastructure services and, increasingly, consumer-facing products. 

Kurz characterizes the current environment as one where “a lot of cycles are sitting on top of each other.” 

While crypto token prices have pulled back substantially, he stresses that the levels reached are now below those at which many fundamentally positive developments have occurred. That disconnect makes it “pretty hard not to scratch your head.” 

In his view, the dominant force behind recent price weakness has been the liquidity and leverage cycle. 

While the October liquidity event and subsequent deleveraging weighed heavily on markets, it differed from 2022, when liquidations exposed structural fragilities in a less developed market architecture. 

Today's pullback is healthier. The ecosystem now includes more sophisticated instruments and better-developed risk-management frameworks. The selloff, he argues, was “a regular wave of deleveraging,” not a systemic breakdown in the back end of the system.

Infrastructure is growing rapidly, and prices usually respond only after tangible increases in activity and adoption, rather than beforehand, he said. When onchain activity and engagement rise again, the story will coalesce around it.

He allows that “there's always a possibility of a leg down,” but said most of the dramatic selling has probably already occurred. Enough pain has been absorbed that consolidation, range-bound trading or a gradual grind higher are more likely than a V-shaped recovery. His base case is several months of consolidation followed by a firmer move into the second half.

At the center of his thesis: Crypto's integration into Wall Street's plumbing. With new connections to traditional finance, crypto is now on a much bigger dashboard of global assets, a position that comes with trade-offs. 

Capital now flows across a broader opportunity set, and crypto competes more directly with established assets like gold or emerging themes such as quantum technology. The bar for attracting global capital is higher.

According to Kurz, that's evidence of maturity. The relationship between crypto and traditional finance is still immature, but is deepening. Public blockchains are increasingly viewed as institutional-grade infrastructure. Stablecoins and tokenization are reshaping payments and market structure. The tentacles of crypto infrastructure are spreading across financial services.

This is what he calls a bull market in crypto plumbing. The infrastructure layer — custody, compliance frameworks, integration with banks and fintechs — is clearly advancing. And while that may not immediately translate into price appreciation in the short term, it is foundationally important for the long-term value of both the technology and the assets built on top of it.

Key to the "Great Convergence” is the fusion of crypto as an asset class with crypto as a technology stack. That integration is driving the creation of a larger, more robust onchain economy. 

Galaxy remains focused on crypto-native assets and believes the long-term bridge being built between infrastructure and capital markets is highly likely to play out. Kurz is clear: This is not a short-term “buy the dip” trade; it is a multiyear structural shift.

Kurz notes that the spread between price, sentiment and underlying business activity has “never been wider.” While market prices have struggled, business activity, particularly on the infrastructure side, remains strong. That divergence gives Galaxy conviction.

He downplays existential fears, such as quantum computing, as immediate threats to crypto's viability. More broadly, he observes that periods of intense negativity often coincide with market bottoms. At the same time, he identifies a subtler risk: apathy. A loss of relevance in the broader market conversation would be more concerning than volatility itself.

Bitcoin BTC$68,559.60, in his experience, often acts as a “canary in the coal mine.” Historically, it has been adept at sniffing out macro risk moves before other markets react. It's possible, he suggests, that BTC sensed broader risk-off conditions and absorbed the pain first. That dynamic can work in both directions.

Having “lived with bitcoin enough,” Kurz believes it can be assessed through a cyclical macro lens. Crypto no longer trades in isolation; it is increasingly intertwined with broader liquidity and risk cycles.

Against this backdrop, Galaxy sees strong momentum in its core businesses, particularly infrastructure and asset management. As of the end of last year, Galaxy had $12 billion in assets on its platform.

On the infrastructure side, Galaxy is doing more than it was a year ago. It provides technology and payments services to banks and fintech companies, and its ability to integrate services with traditional financial institutions continues to improve. 

As for asset management, Galaxy is expanding its offerings, including the introduction of a fintech hedge fund designed for wealth and high-net-worth channels. 

The disruption of financial services market structure represents a “Fintech 2.0” moment and creates both public and private-market investment opportunities, according to Kurz. 

"Galaxy's Fintech Fund will focus on the public markets winners and losers of the great convergence, while Galaxy Ventures will continue to invest in early-stage companies around the globe that are building high quality, crypto-enabled financial services businesses.”

Institutional allocators, pensions, sovereign wealth funds and other asset owners often view crypto as cyclical. But many of these allocators are now making fresh capital allocation decisions. Galaxy reports winning business across banks, wealth intermediaries and institutional asset owners, facilitating inward capital flows even during a consolidation phase.

Institutional assets under management (AUM) remains a key focus, and the firm is seeing growing engagement from large clients. The gap between subdued prices and steady institutional interest reinforces Galaxy's long-term thesis.

Ultimately, Kurz frames Galaxy's strategy as “owning the whole story of the great convergence,” from crypto rails and onchain infrastructure all the way to public markets and asset management. 

The firm is positioning itself across the stack, capturing both the technological integration of crypto into traditional finance and the financialization of crypto assets.

For 2026, the outlook is measured, constructive. Don't expect a V-shaped recovery. Expect consolidation, maturation, continued infrastructure buildout. Expect crypto to compete on a broader stage for global capital. And expect the narrative to catch up to the activity once it turns.

In Kurz's view, the plumbing is being laid for a larger, more durable onchain economy. Prices may lag in the near term, but the long-term fusion of asset and technology leaves him structurally bullish on digital assets, and confident in Galaxy's role at the center of that convergence.

A team led by Min Zhang and Dabao Zhang at the University of California, Irvine's Joe C. Wen School of Population & Public Health has developed the most comprehensive maps yet of how genes directly influence one another in brain cells affected by Alzheimer's disease. These maps go beyond identifying gene links. They reveal which genes are actively controlling others across different cell types in the brain.

To accomplish this, the researchers created a machine learning platform called SIGNET. Unlike traditional tools that only detect genes that appear to move together, SIGNET is designed to uncover true cause-and-effect relationships. Using this approach, the team identified important biological pathways that may contribute to memory loss and the gradual breakdown of brain tissue.

The findings were published in Alzheimer's & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association. The study also highlights newly identified genes that could become promising targets for future treatments. Funding support came in part from the National Institute on Aging and the National Cancer Institute.

Why Understanding Gene Control Matters in Alzheimer's

Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of dementia and is expected to affect nearly 14 million Americans by 2060. Although scientists have linked several genes to the disease, including APOE and APP, they still do not fully understand how these genes interfere with normal brain function.

"Different types of brain cells play distinct roles in Alzheimer's disease, but how they interact at the molecular level has remained unclear," said Min Zhang, co-corresponding author and professor of epidemiology and biostatistics. "Our work provides cell type-specific maps of gene regulation in the Alzheimer's brain, shifting the field from observing correlations to uncovering the causal mechanisms that actively drive disease progression."

How SIGNET Reveals Cause and Effect Between Genes

To build these detailed maps, the team analyzed single-cell molecular data from brain samples donated by 272 participants enrolled in long-term aging studies known as the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project. SIGNET was designed as a scalable, high-performance computing system that combines single-cell RNA sequencing with whole-genome sequencing data. This integration allowed the researchers to detect cause-and-effect relationships among genes across the entire genome.

Using this method, they constructed causal gene regulatory networks for six major brain cell types. This made it possible to determine which genes are likely directing the activity of others, something conventional correlation-based methods cannot reliably accomplish.

"Most gene-mapping tools can show which genes move together, but they can't tell which genes are actually driving the changes," said Dabao Zhang, co-corresponding author and professor of epidemiology and biostatistics. "Some methods also make unrealistic assumptions, such as ignoring feedback loops between genes. Our approach takes advantage of information encoded in DNA to enable the identification of true cause-and-effect relationships between genes in the brain."

Major Genetic Rewiring in Excitatory Neurons

The researchers found that the most significant gene disruptions occur in excitatory neurons -- the nerve cells that send activating signals -- where nearly 6,000 cause-and-effect interactions revealed extensive genetic rewiring as Alzheimer's progresses.

The team also identified hundreds of "hub genes" that function as central regulators, influencing many other genes and likely playing an important role in harmful changes in the brain. These hub genes could become valuable targets for earlier diagnosis and future therapies. The study further uncovered new regulatory roles for well-known genes such as APP, which was shown to strongly control other genes in inhibitory neurons.

To strengthen their conclusions, the researchers validated their findings using an independent set of human brain samples. This additional confirmation increases confidence that the observed gene relationships reflect genuine biological mechanisms involved in Alzheimer's disease.

Beyond Alzheimer's, SIGNET may also be applied to the study of other complex diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disorders and mental health conditions.

The method involves stitching together many thin “slices” of light reflecting off an object.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

In 2025, researchers in Austria were able to put on display an effect of special relativity that's been theorized for 100 years. It's called the Terrell-Penrose effect—also known as Terrell rotation, or the Lampa-Terrell-Penrose effect—and it describes the idea that when an object is traveling at the speed of light, any method of trying to photograph that object will show it to be slightly rotated. 

To recreate this effect in an experiment, scientists from Vienna Center for Quantum Science and Technology (TU Wien) and the University of Vienna combined lasers and high-speed photography to turn light speed into something we can witness up close. The results appear in the peer-reviewed journal Communications Physics.

In the paper, the team—led by corresponding author Dominik Hornof and senior author Peter Schattschneider—explains how physicist Anton Lampa first theorized about these photographic phenomena in 1924. Lampa, who himself studied and taught at the University of Vienna, wrote about what he believed would happen to the appearance of a rod as it approached the cosmic speed limit.

Thirty-five years later, physicists Roger Penrose and Nelson James Terrell separately had the same further insight: a photograph would capture the way the object would appear not condensed (as one might expect), but rotated. In other words, you would go from seeing one face of a cube to seeing two sides and the corner they formed, instead of one distorted single face.

“If you wanted to take a picture of the rocket as it flew past, you would have to take into account that the light from different points took different lengths of time to reach the camera,” Schattschneider explained in a TU Wien statement. “This makes it look to us as if the cube had been rotated.”

But the speed of light is 299,792,458 meters per second. Our best particle accelerators—like those at CERN or Fermilab—can get close enough, but for various reasons, we can't photograph those particles the right way or observe their shape. Instead, the TU Wien team seemed to take a cue from the iPhone's panoramic mode: What if they sliced an object into micro-thin segments to photograph, then assembled the slices into a composite?

To “slice” the object, they used a setup similar to something we usually don't want: the blinding reflection of bright light. In our homes or cars, we shift to avoid the worst of these reflections, but they're exactly what you want when microphotographing light itself. “We illuminate the object with a pulsed laser and take a photo after a certain delay time. Light reflected from parts of the object that correspond to the respective optical path length will appear bright in this photo,” the team wrote.

Using this approach, the team was able to effectively shorten the speed of light to about 2 meters per second. That's like stitching together nearly 150 million photos of your trip to the Grand Canyon. “We combined the still images into short video clips of the ultra-fast objects. The result was exactly what we expected,” Schattschneider said in the statement. “A cube appears twisted, a sphere remains a sphere, but the North Pole is in a different place.”

The team concludes that the same experimental setup—or something iterating on the same ideas—could be used to study other observations about special relativity. In the meantime, make sure to point your good sides (plural) toward the camera when you're traveling at light speed.

Psychedelic substances act on the brain by binding to serotonin receptors. Scientists have identified at least 14 different receptors that respond to the neurotransmitter serotonin. Psychedelics are especially drawn to one known as the 2A receptor. This receptor not only affects learning but also dampens activity in parts of the brain responsible for processing visual information.

"We have observed in earlier studies that visual processes in the brain are suppressed by this receptor," says Callum White, first author of the study. "This means that visual information about things happening in the outside world becomes less accessible to our consciousness. To fill this gap in the puzzle, our brain inserts fragments from memory -- it hallucinates."

In other words, when incoming visual signals are reduced, the brain compensates by pulling stored images and experiences from memory. Those internally generated fragments can blend into perception, producing hallucinations.

Slow Brain Waves Shift Perception Toward Memory

The researchers also uncovered how this shift unfolds in real time. Psychedelics increase rhythmic patterns of brain activity, known as oscillations, in visual regions. Oscillations are coordinated waves of neural firing that help different parts of the brain communicate with each other.

After psychedelics were administered, the team observed a rise in low-frequency (5-Hz) waves in visual areas. These slower waves stimulated another region called the retrosplenial cortex, a key hub involved in accessing stored memories. As this communication strengthens, the brain enters a different operating mode. Awareness of current external events becomes weaker, while perception relies more heavily on recalled information. As Professor Dirk Jancke, who led the study, describes it, the experience is "a bit like partial dreaming."

Real-Time Brain Imaging Reveals the Mechanism

To capture these changes, the scientists used an advanced optical imaging technique that tracks neural activity across the entire surface of the brain in real time. The experiments relied on specially engineered mice created by Professor Thomas Knöpfel at Hong Kong Baptist University. These animals were designed to produce fluorescent proteins in specific types of brain cells.

This approach allowed researchers to pinpoint the source of the signals they recorded. "We therefore know exactly in our experiments that the measured fluorescent signals originate from pyramidal cells of the cortical layers 2/3 and 5, which mediate communication within and between brain regions," says Jancke. These cells play a central role in transmitting information across the cortex.

Implications for Depression and Anxiety Treatment

The findings may also help refine psychedelic-assisted therapy. Researchers believe that, under medical supervision, these substances can temporarily shift brain activity in ways that encourage the recall of positive memories and weaken deeply ingrained negative thought patterns.

"When used under medical supervision, such substances can temporarily change the state of the brain to selectively recall positive memory content and restructure learned, excessively negative thought patterns, i.e., to be able to unlearn negative context. It will be exciting to see how such therapies are further personalized in the future," says Jancke.

By clarifying how psychedelics redirect perception from the outside world to internal memory networks, the study provides a clearer biological explanation for both hallucinations and the growing therapeutic potential of these compounds.

Understanding the high-level conceptual structure of quantum algorithms from their low-level circuit representations is a critical task for verification, debugging, and education. While traditional numerical simulators can calculate output probabilities, they do not explicitly surface the underlying algorithmic logic, such as the function of an oracle or embedded symmetries. In this work, we shift the focus from numerical simulation to symbolic analysis, investigating whether large language models (LLMs) can automatically interpret quantum circuits and articulate their logic in a human-readable format. We introduce GroverGPT+, a model that leverages Chain-of-Thought reasoning and quantum-native tokenization to analyze Grover's search algorithm. We use Grover's algorithm as a controlled testbed, as its well-defined analytical properties allow for rigorous verification of the model's reasoning process. Our primary finding is that GroverGPT+ successfully identifies the oracle and its marked states directly from circuit representations. The model's key output is not a final probability, but a structured, interpretable reasoning trace that mirrors human expert analysis, effectively translating procedural circuit steps into conceptual insights. Furthermore, we establish a structured benchmark for this symbolic analysis task and explore its empirical extrapolation, describing the model's performance as the number of qubits increases. These findings position LLMs as powerful tools for automated quantum algorithm analysis and verification. More fundamentally, this work offers a first step towards using such models as scientific probes, suggesting that an algorithm's “learnability" by a classical model can provide a new, complementary perspective on its conceptual complexity, a topic of core interest to quantum information science.

For example, if a custom returns a product that was opened but they claim was never used (worn in this case) you can't sell it to someone else as a new item. With physical products these go through refurbishing channels if there are enough units to warrant it.What if a batch of products is determined to have some QA problems? You can't sell it as new, so it has to go somewhere. One challenge we discovered the hard way is that there are a lot of companies who will claim to recycle your products or donate them to good causes in other countries, but actually they'll just end up on eBay or even in some cases being injected back in to retail channels through some process we could never figure out. At least with hardware products we could track serial numbers to discover when this was happening.It gets weirder when you have a warranty policy. You start getting warranty requests for serial numbers that were marked as destroyed or that never made it to the retail system. Returned serial numbers are somehow re-appearing as units sold as new. This is less of a problem now that Amazon has mechanisms to avoid inventory co-mingling (if you use them) but for a while we found ourselves honoring warranty claims for items that, ironically enough, had already been warrantied once and then “recycled” by our recycling service.So whenever I see “unsold” I think the situation is probably more complicated than this overview suggests. It's generally a good thing to avoid destroying perfectly good inventory for no good reason, but inventory that gets disposed isn't always perfectly good either. I assume companies will be doing something obvious to mark the units as not for normal sale like punching holes in tags or marking them somewhere]

You start getting warranty requests for serial numbers that were marked as destroyed or that never made it to the retail system. Returned serial numbers are somehow re-appearing as units sold as new. This is less of a problem now that Amazon has mechanisms to avoid inventory co-mingling (if you use them) but for a while we found ourselves honoring warranty claims for items that, ironically enough, had already been warrantied once and then “recycled” by our recycling service.So whenever I see “unsold” I think the situation is probably more complicated than this overview suggests. It's generally a good thing to avoid destroying perfectly good inventory for no good reason, but inventory that gets disposed isn't always perfectly good either. I assume companies will be doing something obvious to mark the units as not for normal sale like punching holes in tags or marking them somewhere]

A robust liquidation market does a lot to prevent waste, and it reduces the cost of living for those who participate, so finding ways to allow products to be truly sold as-is is vital, otherwise the next most logical option is to put those items in a landfill.It's also important that there's no legislative hurdles to seelling items as-is, or there may be no legal way to sell a salvage products without completely overhauling them, which is usually not cost effective.

With textiles this is usually a hole punch or something with the tag. With hardware we had the serial number recorded.But consumers don't care. If they buy something from a vendor they think is selling them something as new and the vendor tells them to go the manufacturer, the customer doesn't care that you marked it as not eligible for warranty. They just want that coverageWe even had customers write ragebait Reddit posts claiming we were unfairly denying warranties, people sending stories to popular newsletters and journalists, and other attempts to make us look bad for not honoring warranties on products they bought through gray market channels.

Maybe this is the problem. Retailers should cover the statutory warranty on any product they sell.

Isn't that good though? Unless the defects make the product somehow dangerous, this means that it found its way to users who are OK with it, thus avoiding waste. And someone even made money in the process.(all assuming the product is not sold as "new")

It's good for shoppers (if they're informed), the recycler, and the environment. It's bad for the original maker.Imagine a factory mix-up means some ExampleCo jeans are made of much lower quality materials than normal. They'll wear out much faster. But ExampleCo's quality control does its job, notices the inferior quality before they hit store shelves, and sends them for recycling.If the recycler sells them on ebay as 'never worn ExampleCo jeans' then:1. Some people who would have paid ExampleCo for jeans instead pay the recycler - leading to lost sales.2. Some of the customers complain online about the bad quality, damaging ExampleCo's reputation3. Some of the customers ask for replacements, which are provided at ExampleCo's expense.

I suspect this will need to be a cultural change. If ExampleCo does it but not RandomCo, of course your reputation will suffer. But if the law is for all of EU, it gives everyone an equal footing.

And that is a very big assumption to make. Recycling is ripe with fraud simply because how much money is in the system.The only way you can really be sure that "recycling" companies don't end up screwing you over is to do rough material separation on your own and dispose of the different material streams (paper packaging, manuals, plastics, PCBs) by different companies.

My initial thought was "reusing an item is even better than recycling" but then realized that a warrantied item is quite likely to have flaws and get warrantied again very soon.I have recently been trolling eBay for used computing equipment rather than buying new, after it was suggested I sell my old hardware that I don't think anyone would want.

Couldn't this be prevented by, say, sticking it on a drill press and drilling a large hole in it, and then recycling it?

It's a shame, because some of those boards could (and would, they are valuable enough) be fully repaired by a skilled repair person. Instead, the chips are picked off and the rest goes to waste.I did buy a batch once that didn't have holes drilled, and they all turned out to have all sorts of strange, often random issues, so I suspect those were RMAs that somehow "fell off the back of a truck" and escaped the drilling.

Not covered by this regulation in spirit and (probably, haven't read it yet) in text. The spirit of the regulation is targeting fast-fashion on-prem retailers (think H&M, Primark, Zara and the likes) and online retailers like Shein, who have heaps of products that just aren't sold because they're not wanted - and also the occasional luxury brand trying to maintain scarcity [1].> but for a while we found ourselves honoring warranty claims for items that, ironically enough, had already been warrantied once and then “recycled” by our recycling service.Yikes.

The price point is already high enough that taxing raw materials doesn't really push the needle on price, they'll just pass the costs on.Utilitarian brands already don't want to destroy clothing because their customers are price sensitive.This forces the brands to do something with excess clothing. I suspect they'll do whatever is the closest to destroying the clothing, like recycling them into rags or shredding them for dog bed filler or something. Maybe even just recycling them back to raw fibers.

Edit: "To prevent unintended negative consequences for circular business models that
involve the sale of products after their preparation for reuse, it should be possible to
destroy unsold consumer products that were made available on the market following
operations carried out by waste treatment operators in accordance with Directive
2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council3. In accordance with that
Directive, for waste to cease to be waste, a market or demand must exist for the
recovered product. In the absence of such a market, it should therefore be possible to
destroy the product." This is a rather interesting paragraph which seems to imply you can destroy clothes if truly nobody wants it.

Von der Leyen also basically had to sell her soul to get enough votes from the red/green parties to get elected, which had a large impact on the way her first Commission operated.Unfortunately (for them), the 10th European Parliament (the current one) is a lot less red/green.  Most member states have also realized that we have a lot of "environmental" regulation that is expensive without helping the environment much (and some cases harming it).  We are already in the process of rolling some of it back.

The waste in terms of destroyed unsold textiles generates the same CO₂ emissions as Sweden in 2021?  Sweden has a population of around 10 million = a bit more than 2% of the EU (I'm still mentally using the pre-Brexit half a billion number).  It has lower CO₂ emissions per capita than most member states due to it having hydropower and nuclear power, but still... call it a round 1% of the total EU CO₂ emissions in round Fermi numbers.The remaining 91-96% would presumably also generate CO₂ emissions -- 11-20 times as much, in other words roughly 11-20% of the EU CO₂ emissions.  Concrete, bricks, heating, agriculture, chemical plants, commuting, etc. all have to share the remaining 80-91%.I don't think that is very believable.(A lot of the strangeness comes from using "total net emissions" which allows Sweden's number to go from around 30 million tons to apparently 6-7 million tons.  Using the doctored number here makes the textile destruction appear much more wasteful than it really is, especially since the burning of said textiles can easily produce electricity and district heating.)

Using the doctored number here makes the textile destruction appear much more wasteful than it really is, especially since the burning of said textiles can easily produce electricity and district heating.)

Now of course this might be a totally acceptable price to pay, I'm not necessarily arguing against it. It will just be conveniently omitted from public communications on the topic by the EU. For regulators, there never are tradeoffs, after all.

Supply control usually benefits the producers, despite what it may seem (destroying items). Increasing the supply lowers the relative pricing power of the vendors, and reduces the price an average consumer pays for the same item, even if the retail price for the item technically increases.I'd say it is good in the long run. If people spent less on clothes, they'd have more to spend on other goods and services or invest in productive endeavors.

If you buy from (It's mostly menswear brands here, sorry ladies) companies who specialize in actually quality vs "fake exclusivity", trends, or hype, than you'll never have to worry about this.I'm specifically talking about selvedge denim brands (i.e. brave star, naked and famous, the osaka 5 brands, etc) high end leather makers (i.e. Horween, Shinki, and the people who make stuff with them like Schott), goodyear welted boots/shoes (i.e. Whites, Nicks, Grant Stone, Meermin, etc), high end made in the USA brands (i.e. Gustin) - this will literally never happen. It's far too damaging for them to destroy any kinds of their stock given it's natural exclusivity and the fact that they always sell basically everything they've got.The fact that they had to pass this ban at all is a signal that normies are bad at buying clothes, and they should feel really bad about it too.

Except that's not why the majority of clothes are thrown away. The real reason they are thrown away is because of size changes and fashionability.HN probably has an over representation of the types of people who wear out clothes and even here it's likely a minority that actually do wear out clothes.

The best fashion is timeless, and that's why heritage fashion is far superior to trends. Coincidentally, it's why the brands I listed above are exclusively heritage brands, who have basically no regards for trends.There's a reason HN is poorly dressed. I'd rather take the "only dresses with startup T-shirt" guy over the "I've gotta have the Sydney Sweeney Jeans" person, and especially over the sneakerhead crowd which now thinks Hoka and NB is superior to Nike.

This is a very niche feature of low volume brands.

This is exactly it. The actual landed cost is 1/10th of the sales price, and most of the rest of the margin pads the marketing and exclusivity machine. If for instance LV starts selling their $200-landed Neverfull bags at $500 or even $1,000, all the infrastructure sustaining the image becomes unsustainable.

reply

My personal opinion is that the business model of selling status items - specifically those which only have status because of an artificially limited supply they control - is inherently predatory and should be restricted. Not because I'm the morality police and want to stop people from buying a bag that says "I spent $2000 on a bag", but because there is nothing that stops the company from cost-reducing that to oblivion. If you are going to sell a $2,000 bag, it should be marketed on quality, not a cult.

reply

Clothing has been used as wealth/class indicator for thousands of years, trying to change that will be extremely difficult lift.

reply

IMO selling the clothes to people that otherwise couldn't afford them is always better than destroying them, so EU is doing the right thing here.

That is a feature, not a bug. Risk-taking in "apparel, clothing, accessories and footwear" which results in wasted resources is not something to incentivise.

We wouldn't have 99% of the technological advancements we've made without a fuckton of failure and waste.

The "fuckton of failure and waste" which has brought technological advancements to humanity didn't come from destroying unsold clothing, and the risks involved in actual technological advancements are orders of magnitude larger than the risk of not being able to destroy unsold consumer products without penalty.

Sarcasm aside, I wonder if they calculated how much we save by not trashing these items, versus the cost in time, bureaucracy, and administration this will demand.

> Managing and getting rid of free stuff is very expensive and hard. But that someone else's problem.While I think we deeply disagree with what "hard" means, it does feel like its the kind of cost a reasonable organization would willingly take on. I compare it to the chefs, or restauranteers who after they're done cooking for the day bring all the food that they have to a local food bank or shelter instead of throwing it away. That's an equally expensive endevor, just on different scale. I think it's reasonable to expect all organizations to act with some moral character, and given larger companies have demonstrated they lack moral character, and would otherwise hyper optimize into a negative sum game they feel they can win. I think some additional micromanaging is warranted. You don't?Everyone should be discouraged from playing a negative sum game.

The battle for enterprise AI is heating up. Microsoft is bundling Copilot into Office. Google is pushing Gemini into Workspace. OpenAI and Anthropic are selling directly to enterprises. Every SaaS vendor now ships an AI assistant. 

In the scramble for the interface, Glean is betting on something less visible: becoming the intelligence layer beneath it. 

Seven years ago, Glean set out to be the Google for enterprise — an AI-powered search tool designed to index and search across a company's SaaS tool library, from Slack to Jira, Google Drive to Salesforce. Today, the company's strategy has shifted from building a better enterprise chatbot to becoming the connective tissue between models and enterprise systems.

“The layer we built initially – a good search product – required us to deeply understand people and how they work and what their preferences are,” Jain told TechCrunch on last week's episode of Equity, which we recorded at Web Summit Qatar. “All of that is now becoming foundational in terms of building high quality agents.”

He says that while large language models are powerful, they're also generic. 

“The AI models themselves don't really understand anything about your business,” Jain said. “They don't know who the different people are, they don't know what kind of work you do, what kind of products you build. So you have to connect the reasoning and generative power of the models with the context inside your company.”

Glean's pitch is that it already maps that context and can sit between the model and the enterprise data. 

The Glean Assistant is often the entry point for customers — a familiar chat interface powered by a mix of leading proprietary (ie, ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) and open-source models, grounded in the company's internal data. But what keeps customers, Jain argues, is everything underneath it. 

First is model access. Rather than forcing companies to commit to a single LLM provider, Glean acts as the abstraction layer, allowing enterprises to switch between or combine models as capabilities evolve. That's why Jain says he doesn't see OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google as competition, but rather as partners. 

“Our product gets better because we're able to leverage the innovation that they are making in the market,” Jain said. 

Second are the connectors. Glean integrates deeply with systems like Slack, Jira, Salesforce, and Google Drive to map how information flows across them and enable agents to act inside those tools. 

And third, and perhaps most important, is governance. 

“You need to build a permissions-aware governance layer and retrieval layer that is able to bring the right information, but knowing who's asking that question so that it filters the information based on their access rights,” Jain said. 

In large organizations, that layer can be the difference between piloting AI solutions and deploying them at scale. Enterprises can't simply load all their internal data into a model and create a wrapper to sort out the solutions later, says Jain. 

Also critical is ensuring the models don't hallucinate. Jain says its system verifies model outputs against source documents, generates line-by-line citations, and ensures that responses respect existing access rights. 

The question is whether that middle layer survives as platform giants push deeper into the stack. Microsoft and Google already control much of the enterprise workflow surface area, and they're hungry for more. If Copilot or Gemini can access the same internal systems with the same permissions, does a standalone intelligence layer still matter?

Jain argues enterprises don't want to be locked into a single model or productivity suite and would rather opt for a neutral infrastructure layer rather than a vertically integrated assistant.

Investors have bought into that thesis. Glean raised a $150 million Series F in June 2025, nearly doubling its valuation to $7.2 billion. Unlike the frontier AI labs, Glean doesn't need massive compute budgets.

“We have a very healthy, fast-growing business,” Jain said.

After the Justice Department released a trove of new documents tied to infamous sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, journalists digging through them have found extensive connections to Silicon Valley.

TechCrunch's Sean O'Kane examined how a mysterious businessman named David Stern built a relationship with Epstein and pitched him investments in multiple electric vehicle startups, including Faraday Future, Lucid Motors, and Canoo.

On the latest episode of the Equity podcast, Kirsten Korosec and I talk to Sean about what he learned, and we discuss whether the Epstein revelations will lead to broader fallout in Silicon Valley.

You can read a preview of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, in the transcript below.

Sean: There are always people at the edges who don't necessarily want to be front and center in the investment scene. And that was why I started looking through these files, in part because a long time ago, flashback 10 years ago on my beat especially, there was just a ton of Chinese investment in the space. 

This was before even the rush of EV startups in China that we see today […] In autonomous vehicles, but electric vehicles especially, there was this moment where Chinese investors and Chinese companies, state-owned automakers, all they wanted to do was to be looked at like Silicon Valley startups. So they came here and they invested in companies and helped get them off the ground, or in some cases even set up offices in Silicon Valley.

And it was in that environment that a lot of the companies that I've covered for a long time popped up. There was just never a full picture of how a lot of them were funded. 

One in particular, this company called Canoo, which is now bankrupt and out of business, had maybe the most mysterious set of investors of all of them. They really were not upfront about it when they first sort of came out of stealth in early 2018. And it frankly took until there was a lawsuit between some people who ran the company near the top that the investors were revealed. 

At the time, it was this businessman in China who was relatively close, the son-in-law of the former sort of like the fourth most senior CCP official under the previous leader of China and a giant electronics magnate from Taiwan. And then there was this really strange guy named David Stern, who was the third founding investor. And there was so little information about this guy.

I could tell, back then, that he was some sort of German businessman, that he had some connections to China, but it wasn't really clear how he had gotten involved. The only thing I really remember hearing at the time was that he was close with Prince Andrew, which I just thought was very strange, this idea that someone had even told me a long time ago, probably in 2018 or 2019, that Prince Andrew was involved with this company Canoo in some way, maybe not invested, but advising or something.

It was something that stuck in my head for a very long time, clearly, because I went looking for that information as more of these files came out, assuming that proximity to Prince Andrew means proximity to someone like Epstein.

And that was the case here, more so than I could have imagined, because this guy Stern turned from an enigma or a ghost into someone who was present through all this dealmaking 10 years ago, where we see him pitching, in the span of about a year and a half, investments in Faraday Future, trying to convince Epstein to maybe throw a couple hundred million dollars into that company, trying to buy the 30% stake that Faraday Future's founder had bought or acquired in Lucid Motors arrival at the time, which I feel is an overlooked dynamic [in] how those companies grew around then — and then also in Canoo.

Epstein never invested in any of those companies despite that proximity, but it was just such a revealing thing. And I get into it in the story that I wrote last week, but we get this sweep of a decade of relationship that Stern had with Epstein from approaching him initially in 2008, kind of hat in hand, and introducing himself and saying, “Hey, I want to invest in China. Will you throw in some money?” to being someone who was seemingly very close to him by the end. 

Kirsten: The whole thing is really interesting, and it goes back to my initial comments about how sometimes when you get a chance to look back at with new information at how deals were unfolding, it really just changes your perception and perspective of the time.

And for those who didn't follow quote-unquote “mobility,” think of it as how we're thinking about physical AI these days. Everyone was talking about it. Every automaker wanted to have a piece of quote-unquote “the future of transportation” or “mobility.” And so it makes a lot of sense that some of these more secretive types were also jumping in. 

Sean, one of the points you made to me as I was working on the story with you, in terms of editing it, you were [saying], it was very clear that Epstein and David Stern weren't really about investing and building companies. It was all about how to make the most money the fastest. And that, I think, is really historically important and interesting and gives you a little bit of an insight into — in addition to all the horrible, horrifying, terrible things he did to human beings, [Epstein] was a complete operator as well, in order to make money as quickly as possible. And you see that in these emails and exchanges between David Stern and Epstein.

Sean: Yeah, to both of those points really, I open the story with a moment in time where Lucid Motors […] they had been basically a battery supplier for a long time and then they pivoted into the passenger vehicle startup that we know them as today, but they were really struggling to raise their Series D at the time, and they really needed that money to start production of their first electric sedan. 

They were struggling, behind the scenes in large part because the founder of Arrival quietly amassed this major stake and was kind of pushing people away and making it look like an uninvestable company in some ways, but the hype around all of that at the time was creating opportunities for people like Stern and Epstein, and we see them talk in these emails about, you know, Stern comes to Epstein and basically says, “I heard that they're raising. Can you get information from Morgan Stanley?”

Epstein turns around and passes that information back, and then you see this discussion about, okay, well, Morgan Stanley says Ford — which was reported at the time — had kind of an investment offer, potential acquisition offer, on the table for Lucid Motors [and] was going to come in in that Series D. And they're chopping up — do we invest in this and maybe get a big return down the road? Or is it something that we sell as Ford comes in a couple months later, if we can get this stake now at fire sale prices?

Ultimately, they didn't go through with that, but Stern did eventually invest in Canoo and help get that company off the ground.

Anthony: One thing — maybe pulling back a little bit from the specific industries or investments — that's also an important piece of context that generally gets mentioned in any of these stories about Epstein in Silicon Valley, but is worth repeating here, is that he [pleaded] guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008.

Almost all the emails that we're talking about with these stories [and] in pretty much any other story about Epstein in Silicon Valley comes after that. So it's also partly a story about how people get comfortable with the idea that, okay, this guy has a pretty shady past already. He wasn't the infamous criminal that he eventually [became], but there were things that were already known about him, and because he was a source of connections to power, to famous names, to money, a lot of people were just willing to look past that.

Pretty much everyone I know is unhappy with their hair in some way. All of my straight-haired friends want curly, and all of my curly-haired friends want straight. I'm so jealous of people who have thick hair, as someone with fine, thin hair that tangles easily.

My hair also grows famously slow. I got a pixie cut in spring of 2011, and my hair did not touch my shoulders until the end of 2013. Plus, because my hair is super thin, when I pull it back, it separates, and you can see my scalp underneath. Because it's so fine, it tangles and often breaks off, resulting in chronically dry split ends.

Overall, I'm unhappy with my hair and its lack of growth or fullness, so I wanted to see if CurrentBody's cord-free, Bluetooth-enabled LED Hair Growth Helmet would work for my slew of hair issues. Red-light-therapy devices for hair are similar to red-light therapy masks for your face, using red lights to increase hair growth and promote a healthy scalp. You need to use the device for only 10 minutes a day, and CurrentBody claims you'll see results within 12 weeks. While my results weren't super visually dramatic, I noticed my hair feeling thicker while shampooing, and I saw a lot more “baby hairs” spring up on my hairline after about three months of testing.

Unlike more discreet red-light hair growth devices, like the HigherDose Red Light Hat (see our full review here), CurrentBody's entry is a full-on helmet, lined with 10 strips of 12 red lights each on a spectrum of 620 to 660 nm (nanometers, the unit of measure for the wavelength of visible light). This works similarly to red-light-therapy face masks, which aim to improve skin conditions and spur new cell growth using red-light therapy in the mid-600-nm range. The 620-nm red light helps to improve scalp health by promoting circulation, and the 660-nm red light goes deeper, reaching through the epidermis and dermis to the hypodermis, where it stimulates growth and repair at the follicle root.

Red-light wavelengths are clinically proven to energize hair follicles; improve scalp blood flow; reduce inflammation; lower dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels, a hormone that causes hair loss and thinning; and support production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which helps to store and release energy in cells. This wavelength of red light triggers follicles to stay in the hair growth phase by providing oxygen and blood flow to the scalp.

The helmet is FDA-cleared (meaning it's been determined to be equivalent to a similar, legally marketed device) and is FSA (flexible spending account) or HSA (health spending account) eligible with a letter of medical necessity. It comes in two sizes: medium, for a skull circumference of 21.3 to 23.2 inches, or large, for 23.3 to 25 inches. (I opted for medium, and it was still too large for my head.) The device sits on a base and is charged via a USB-C cord. It takes about three hours to fully charge the helmet, and it lasts about a week on a single charge. (The white light on the side flashes while charging and turns solid white when the battery is full.) The device is powered on by pressing the single button located under the charging port.

Rating: 8/10

The ear cups keep sensitive ears protected with plush, removable faux leather and can be moved several inches up or down to ensure a comfortable fit. The screen on the right ear cup displays the remaining time in the session, and the display turns off when the 10 minutes are up. You can also connect the device to Bluetooth and play any type of music or video through the ear cups, because God forbid I be left alone with my thoughts for 10 minutes a day.

You'll need to make sure your hair is clean and dry before using. Plus, consistent use is essential to achieve the most accurate results, which was probably the biggest issue for me. Although it's convenient and super easy to use (and allows me to listen to Bad Bunny while wearing!), I tend to wash my hair only about three times a week. The helmet can't be worn when hair is dirty or wet (after showering), so the window for ideal wear was small. You'll see best results when worn every day for the first three months, and it's advised to continue use at least five times a week to maintain growth results after.

You know that feeling when someone plays with your hair and you get tingles on your scalp? That's the sensation I had while wearing the device. During each session, I felt super-faint tingles that meant that blood flow was circulating to my scalp and my follicles were getting aroused. I could definitely feel the red light targeting my scalp and increasing blood flow; it was interesting to be able to physically feel effects before seeing the results.

After 12 weeks, I didn't notice a huge difference in actual length growth (although I got a haircut halfway through testing), but I did notice that my hair seemed to be sprouting new follicles along my scalp and sideburn area in particular. The biggest change was that I started to see small baby hairs along my hairline that I had never seen before. As someone with very thin, fine hair, my scalp tends to be finely filled out with flat hair. Although it was only a quarter-inch high or so, there was definitely new hair growth around the crown of my head.

My stylist commented that my hair felt thicker during my appointment, and I noticed less breakage and hair caught in bristles when brushing. Neither of us noticed major improvements in the actual length growth of my hair, but it did feel stronger. In the shower, I noticed less hair loss while shampooing and conditioning, which was a major improvement. My balding roommate also tested it (though not daily as I do) and noted that his hair felt thicker and showed new growth around his scalp.

My only complaints with the LED helmet are that the ear cups aren't easy to adjust while wearing them, and the little cups that provide separation between the scalp and device often pulled my hair while I remove or adjust the helmet.

However, those are small complaints. Although progress didn't happen overnight, I'm hopeful that with continued use over the year, I'll be able to see more dramatic results. I'm super excited to keep testing this product to improve the health of my scalp and get more new growth for fuller hair. Just you wait—I'll look like Fabio on the cover of a romance novel by next year.

Olympic bobsledding often gets called the “Formula 1 of ice.” Tracks are more than 1.5 kilometers (nearly a mile) long, and athletes often race down them at speeds nearing 145 kilometers per hour (90 mph). Bobsledders—whether in teams of four, two, or sliding solo—are often subjected to gravitational forces in excess of 5g. At the 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Games, they're using tech aimed at making each phase of the race, from initial push to technical driving to final braking, just a little bit more precise than in previous Games.

Men's four-person bobsledding made its Olympic debut in Chamonix, France, in 1924; women's two-person bobsledding didn't enter the Games until 2002 in Salt Lake City. Women's monobob arrived in 2022. While the earliest bobsleds were made of wood, the sport has been synonymous with steel for years, although in recent decades it has been replaced by carbon fiber, which provides greater lightness and strength.

Each new technological development in the sport has come amid the constraints necessary to keep athletes safe, such as weight and sled sizes. The two-person bobsled can have a max length of 2.7 meters (about 8.9 feet) and a max weight of 390 kilograms (859.8 pounds), including crew. A four-person bobsled cannot exceed 630 kilograms (1,388.9 pounds), including bobbers, and 3.8 meters (12.47 feet) in length.

The weight limit was a necessary move to equalize race conditions and curb the use of athletic specialists who, although not bobsledders, have in the past proven decisive in their teams' success through the pushing phase. This is far from coincidental, because this is one of the areas where technology makes the biggest impact bobsledding.

At the 2022 Beijing Olympic Games, Germany won 27 medals, 16 of which came from bobsledding, luge, and skeleton. German athletes tend to excel at bobsled because the sport has a long tradition in Germany but also because the country has long focused on innovation in the sport. Automaker BMW, for example, is a strategic partner of the the German federation that oversees bobsledding, luge, and skeleton (Bob- und Schlittenverband für Deutschland) and is credited with the introduction of custom studded shoes, a crucial tool for bobbers' performance.

The first 30 to 50 meters of Olympic bobsled often prove decisive in a race, because it is the only time when athletes can push the sled to reach max acceleration. A couple of years ago, BMW realized that innovations in the bobbers' footwear could improve their performance during that crucial time.

Looking at the preferences for each team member, BMW made custom spike plates that can be integrated into any type of shoe. Using 3D printing, the company was able to adapt the stiffness and shape of the studs for different shoes and needs. Working this way allowed them to experiment and modify designs quickly. To avoid excessive wear or breakage, the spikes are given greater hardness through plasma nitriding, in which nitrogen is ionized in a high-temperature vacuum and diffused into the steel.

The custom footwear for German bobsledders.

Like Germany, the US is a bobsledding powerhouse. One key piece of gear for the team at the 2026 Games are the bobbers' dynamic insoles. Devised by VKTRY Gear, which has partnered with the US Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation for more than a decade, the insoles are the brainchild of the company's founder, Matt Arciuolo. Traditional insoles are “passive devices that absorb shock and support,” Arciuolo says, but his insole “is shaped, and when placed on a flat surface only touches the heel and toe of the foot.”

“These insoles help provide a higher level of stiffness and useful energy return to optimize effort during the bobsled push,” says Kaillie Humphries, a Canadian bobber who has been competing for the US since 2019 and won gold in the monobob at the Beijing 2022 Games.

Dynamic insoles that return energy to athletes.

The US and Germany are also ahead of the curve when it comes to their focus on leveraging data to help athletes map their tracks and remedy weaknesses in their performance. Prior to this year's Games, the US Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation partnered with a company called Snowflake to leverage the company's AI tools to analyze data and make changes to bobbers' movements on the track.

Snowflake's AI allowed coaches to identify which push pairings worked best for two- and four-person crews. It also analyzed performance inefficiencies with a focus on any bumping between athletes during the jump phase—the moment in which team members board the bobsled after the push. The analysis aimed to shave a few hundredths of a second off of race time.

The connection between engineers and German bobbers in the Data Coach system.

The new Cortina Sliding Centre provides the ideal place for Germany's bobsled and luge teams to test out Data Coach, their new system for analyzing data from sensors installed on the sled. Thanks to software developed by Julian von Schleinitz, a former world luge champion and current head of BMW Group's tech and AI solutions division, the team can study the best trajectories with which to approach curves and facilitate race strategy.

As the data set has grown, Data Coach has refined its effectiveness and even made it possible to test out new components and configurations before trying out a new sled.

While improving performance is key for bobsled teams, so is safety. Moving at speeds close to 90 mph puts a strain on the spine and neck. To help, China has built a sled from T800 carbon fiber, a composite often used by the aerospace industry for its lightness and rigidity. In addition to reducing the overall weight by nearly 20 percent compared to conventional models, the bobsled made in China can reportedly withstand bad impacts, making it more durable and safe.

Many of the more serious accidents in bobsledding happen during runway exists, collisions, and rollovers. A year ago, the German federation and Allianz launched an initiative to address those accidents. The Allianz Safety Sled appeared as a prototype during last year's World Championships, and during the Milano Cortina Games it's being used to analyze ice and runway conditions, allowing riders to prepare for their decent.

The sled, says Carsten Reinkemeyer, the head of safety research at the Allianz Center for Technology, aims to apply safety principles in three key areas: “keeping athletes inside the sled in case of an accident, the ability to brake the bobsled, and improving protective clothing and helmets.”

The Safety Sled prototype designed by Allianz.

One of the Safety Sled's most notable features is the Head Impact Protector, which was designed to be easily integrated into existing bobsleds without hindering athletes' mobility during entry into the sled. At the rear of the structure are raised push bars, which create additional space for the bobsled's occupants and protect dedicated push athletes.

Current preliminary designs, involving Allianz and the Institute for Research and Development of Sports Equipment in Berlin (manufacturer of the bobsleds for the German federation), involve a system consisting of two parts, one attached to the suit and the other to the bobsled, which are to be adapted to each athlete's position inside the sled. “These are measures aimed at preventing athletes from being thrown out of the bobsled by high collision forces and suffering damage generated by contact with the sled,” Reinkemeyer says.

Reddit, Meta, and Google voluntarily “complied with some of the requests” for identifying details of users critical of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) sent as part of a recent wave of administrative subpoenas the Department of Homeland Security has been distributing to Big Tech the past few months, according to an anonymously sourced New York Times report.

Those three companies, plus Discord, have received “hundreds” of such requests that have come from DHS recently. Meta, it should be noted, is the parent company of Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp.

Administrative subpoenas used for this purpose represent an escalation. This tool, which comes not from a judge but from DHS itself, was formerly reserved for situations like child abductions, according to the Times.

The users were targeted because their posts “criticized ICE or pointed to the locations of ICE agents,” the Times says.

A Google spokesperson replied to the Times with a statement, saying “When we receive a subpoena, our review process is designed to protect user privacy while meeting our legal obligations,” and “We inform users when their accounts have been subpoenaed, unless under legal order not to or in an exceptional circumstance. We review every legal demand and push back against those that are overbroad.”

Gizmodo requested comment from Meta, Discord, and Reddit. We will update if we hear back.

According to the Times, one or multiple of the relevant companies have stated that they notify users of these requests from DHS, and give them a 14-day window to “fight the subpoena in court” before complying.

Amazon has also been accused of at least some degree of participation with ICE's ongoing mass deportation efforts. In October, Amazon-owned Ring announced a partnership with Flock that would loop the AI-powered network into the content coming from users' doorbell cameras. According to a 404 Media investigation, that network feeds information to law enforcement agencies at the local and federal levels, allowing for reasonable concern that ICE has access to all that footage.

Protesters have launched an effort called “Resist and Unsubscribe” targeting ten tech companies they perceive as exceptionally supportive of ICE. That list includes Meta, Google, and Amazon, but not Reddit.

A vintage technology enthusiast has turned a miniature Mac-a-like desk toy alarm clock into a real Mac software-running computer. Colin from This Does Not Compute (TDNC) says he was drawn to the handsome Maclock on Amazon ($30). However, its pleasingly faithful looks made him wish that it could do more than basic alarm clock duties.

TDNC remembered a mini Mac project that looked very similar to the Maclock. In contrast, that project was let down somewhat by a poorly detailed chassis. But it packed a Raspberry Pi Zero for some real classic Mac emulation fun.

With the inspiration to go ahead, all the components were bought, and the ‘WonderMac' project began. Cracking the Maclock case was the hardest part of the project, says the TechTuber. A bit of patience with the use of a steel spudger paid off, though.

The original Maclock screen couldn't be re-purposed, but TDNC found a 2.8-inch Waveshare SVGA resolution touchscreen part that interfaces with the Raspberry Pi Zero W, and fitted very nicely into the alarm clock chassis.

Before going further with physically fitting the added Pi and new screen hardware, a few software steps were taken. This part of the project started with installing the latest Pi OS on an SD card and adding Waveshare 2.4-inch touchscreen drivers.

TDNC first thought about using a modern Mac emulator called Snow, but after a series of issues, decided on the older, lightweight Mini vMac. This wasn't a cinch to get running, either, but after Colin recompiled the latest beta from source, it worked fine on the Pi Zero. Lastly, on the software side, Mini vMac was set to autorun from boot for a nice, slick, hands-off startup experience.

The TechTuber wanted to reuse the existing Maclock USB-C input to power the system. This wasn't very straightforward, as it had charging circuitry that needed to be removed, so that the Pi got 5V direct from the back-facing port on the chassis. These power leads were then soldered to two pads on the Pi Zero W's PCB.

Next, a 3D printed bracket would be designed and output to secure the Pi and screen into the Maclock chassis in the correct position. Sadly, in this implementation, the brightness dial on the lower lip of the tiny Mac's screen bezel becomes a mere cosmetic addition. Similarly, two clock control buttons that remain also don't do anything anymore. Some other small tweaks, trims, and snips were required to fit the new brains and screen into the Maclock chassis neatly and securely.

It all worked, with a few tiny niggles. Overall, the TechTuber says he is pleased with the result, but admits it isn't the cheapest project, costing about $100 for all the products used. Graciously, TDNC has shared project essentials like the 3D-printable screen bracket and a WonderMac GitHub repository covering the software side. These are great resources if you want to replicate or build upon this super cute classic mini Mac project.

Something strange happened at University of California campuses this fall. For the first time since the dot-com crash, computer science enrollment dropped. System-wide, it fell 6% last year after declining 3% in 2024, according to reporting this past week by the San Francisco Chronicle. Even as overall college enrollment climbed 2% nationally — according to January data from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center — students are bailing on traditional CS degrees.

The one exception is UC San Diego  — the only UC campus that added a dedicated AI major this fall.

This all might look like a temporary blip tied to news about fewer CS grads finding work out of college. But it's more likely an indicator of the future, one that China is much more enthusiastically embracing. As MIT Technology Review reported last July, Chinese universities have leaned hard into AI literacy, treating AI not as a threat but instead as essential infrastructure. Nearly 60% of Chinese students and faculty now use AI tools multiple times daily, and schools like Zhejiang University have made AI coursework mandatory, while top institutions like Tsinghua have created entirely new interdisciplinary AI colleges. In China, fluency with AI isn't optional anymore; it's table stakes.

U.S. universities are scrambling to catch up. Over the last two years, dozens have launched AI-specific programs. MIT's “AI and decision-making” major is now the second-largest major on campus, says the school. As reported by the New York Times in December, the University of South Florida enrolled more than 3,000 students in a new AI and cybersecurity college during its fall semester. The University at Buffalo last summer launched a new “AI and Society” department that offers seven new, specialized undergraduate degree programs, and it received more than 200 applicants before it swung open its doors.

The transition hasn't been smooth everywhere. When I spoke with UNC Chapel Hill Chancellor Lee Roberts in October, he described a spectrum — some faculty “leaning forward” with AI, others with “their heads in the sand.” Roberts, a former finance executive who arrived from outside academia, was pushing hard for AI integration despite faculty resistance. A week earlier, UNC had announced it would merge two schools to create an AI-focused entity — a decision that drew faculty pushback. Roberts had also appointed a vice provost specifically for AI. “No one's going to say to students after they graduate, ‘Do the best job you can, but if you use AI, you'll be in trouble,'” Roberts told me. “Yet we have faculty members effectively saying that right now.”

Parents are playing a role in this rocky transition, too. David Reynaldo, who runs the admissions consultancy College Zoom, told the Chronicle that parents who once pushed kids toward CS are now reflexively steering them toward other majors that seem more resistant to AI automation, including mechanical and electrical engineering.

But the enrollment numbers suggest students are voting with their feet. According to a survey in October by the nonprofit Computing Research Association — its members include computer science and computer engineering departments from a wide range of universities — 62% of respondents reported that their computing programs saw undergraduate enrollment declines this fall. But with AI programs ballooning, it's looking less like a tech exodus and more like a migration. The University of Southern California is launching an AI degree this coming fall; so are Columbia University, Pace University, and New Mexico State University, among many others. Students aren't abandoning tech; they're choosing programs focused on AI instead to land work.

It's too soon to say whether this recalibration is permanent or a temporary panic or a near-term solution to a longer-term challenge. But it's certainly a wake-up call for administrators who've spent years wrestling with how to handle AI in the classroom. The debate over whether to ban ChatGPT is ancient history at this point. The question now is whether American universities can move fast enough or whether they'll keep arguing about what to do while students transfer to schools that already have answers.

Same experience.  I have a commandline program I wrote to retrieve YouTube download URLs many years ago.  On average it has always been more reliable than Newpipe.  It continues to work when Newpipe fails and I can fix it quickly when there is a YouTube changeHowever I noticed recently Newpipe, the original, not SponsorBlock, old version, no updates, had been going many weeks without failure.  When it eventually failed I was able to get it working again immediately by simply changing the www.youtube.com IPv4 addressWill try this again when it fails the next time

Either way, I also knew what they meant, because "vertical video" is not an inscrutable term that leaves any room to guess it's meaning incorrectly. It's entirely scrutable.You can keep trying to defend the obtuse complaint that all videos have a vertical dimension, but if it were me I think I would not be so eager to advertise that I was this baffled by this.

We are oft implored, not only by our famous and much-valued dang, but also the other guy (whatever his name is. He does a great job too though), not to editorialize the titles by submitting submissions with titles other than the actual title. How can you tell if the submitted title is other than the actual title? That's easy. You read the one and read the other and compare the two and see if they're different. (Which is another way of restating the previous paragraph.) In this case: they are. (Or at least were at time of writing! Since you'll be reading this in the future.) Hence my complaint.The vertical video thing? That was just my little joke. OF COURSE I KNOW THAT VERTICAL VIDEO MEANS PORTRAIT VIDEO. And, yes, I have visited youtube.com, and have had a big pile of portrait shorts shit up the feed, same as everybody else. I am not completely... wait, hang on. I am completely stupid. Because I thought it would be so obvious that it was a joke, that nobody would bother to quibble. They'd just chuckle at my attempt to amuse the reader, or roll their eyes at it and ignore it, and then go on to moan at me about some other part of my post. Though, reading my post again, more fool me perhaps. I guess I didn't leave people enough other material to complain about.Sorry. I'll try to do better in future.

Noahkai Banks may be young and still looking for his first U.S. men's national team cap, but that hasn't stopped Landon Donovan from predicting the defender will start at the 2026 World Cup.

Banks has become a regular starter this season for Augsburg, despite only recently turning 19. The 6-foot-4 defender is considered one of the best American center-back prospects in many years and has earned one USMNT call-up.

But the defender did not see the field last fall during his only USMNT camp, making next month's camp massive for his World Cup hopes.

If he is to make a late charge toward a World Cup spot, Banks will likely need to earn a call-up for friendlies against Belgium and Portugal – the team's last two games before Mauricio Pochettino names his World Cup squad.

Donovan is feeling bullish on the young defender's chances. On his "Unfiltered Soccer" show, the USMNT legend explained why he believes Banks won't just make Pochettino's World Cup squad, but will start this summer.

"Tim Ream is locked and going to play. Chris Richards is more than locked and going to play. I think Pochettino wants this team to have the ability to play in a back three," he said. "I think the team performs best in a back three.

"So your options become (Mark) McKenzie, Miles Robinson and even Noahkai Banks. You can maybe move Joe Scally if he makes the team. Alex Freeman can play there, maybe Antonee Robinson can play on the (right).

"But I think (Banks is) a kid who's played on the right side of a (back) three earlier this season, played on the left side of a (back) three. So he's clearly comfortable. He's playing in the Bundesliga every week as an 18-year-old. And I just think when push comes to shove, Pochettino might go, 'OK, yeah, he's young. But what are the alternatives?'"

Banks spoke with reporters earlier this week and was asked about his outlook toward the World Cup.

The teenager insisted that his only focus for now is on Augsburg, which is currently battling to avoid relegation from the Bundesliga.

"I think it's not the right moment to think about the World Cup, because we have a lot of games left here, and we want to win those games because we have goals for the season," he said.

"A lot of players say it, but I really mean it: I really just focus on the games we have here. And then let's see what happens in the summer."

Giannis Antetokounmpo has explained why he is more Cristiano Ronaldo than Lionel Messi, with the NBA superstar adding his voice to the long-running GOAT debate. The Milwaukee Bucks talisman is hoping to form part of those discussions in basketball circles and sees himself being cut from similar sporting cloth to Portuguese icon CR7 - while being a huge admirer of magical Argentina international Messi.

Giannis is, having grown up in Greece, an avid football fan. He follows the game closely, while boasting professional ties to a couple of clubs, and looks to take inspiration from those that have reached the very top of professions that are different to the one that has made him a household name.

Messi and Ronaldo have dominated the football scene for more than two decades, with both still going strong in 2026. The former has signed a contract extension at MLS Cup winners Inter Miami through 2028, while the latter is generating transfer talk at Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr.

It has been suggested that CR7 could head to the United States, allowing him to either line up alongside or against eternal rival Messi. Giannis is among those that would love to see a stunning transfer thrashed out.

For now, he is watching on from afar as a couple of all-time greats raise the bar of individual brilliance to heights that few can ever dream of reaching. Giannis considers Messi to be the ultimate footballing talent, but sees more of himself in Ronaldo - with the evergreen 41-year-old having built his reputation on hard work and dedication to his craft.

Speaking at the NBA All-Star Game's Media Day, Giannis said when asked for his take on the Messi vs Ronaldo discussion that divides opinion around the world: “I think Messi is a pure talent. Pure talent, and with hard work and discipline throughout his career and consistency of being in the top. He is probably, maybe, the best player of all time.

“But for me, I relate and I get closer to people that I'm similar to them, like hard work, discipline, take care of your body, be consistent for many years. He's 41 years old now, right? 41 years old, still playing high level, so my mindset is closer to Cristiano Ronaldo's mindset.

“Different people, he's more flashy than me and I'm not like that. But when it comes to the game, the love and the consistency and the hard work and the, you know, push the envelope and keep on getting better, I'm more similar to Ronaldo.

“So when you ask me that question, I say Ronaldo but now if you put them, who has accomplished more in their career; eight Ballons d'Or, five Ballons d'Or, World Cup, not the World Cup, five Champions League, four Champions League, it's what you prefer.

“The most important thing, once you get to that point that you say Messi or Ronaldo, you already won. I wish to get to a point where they say [Michael] Jordan or Giannis, I already won in life.”

Giannis has previously said of those that excel with a ball at their feet, rather than in hand: “You have unbelievable players. Luis Figo, Nani, and Deco, who were growing up, were one of my favourite players. But at the end you gotta go with the GOAT, the one and only Cristiano Ronaldo. Any sport he'd play, he'd probably be good at it.”

Giannis is a part-owner of Nashville SC in MLS. That stake means that he has come up against Messi. Back in 2023, following the Argentine's stunning move to America, Antetokounmpo attended a game with Inter Miami.

He further pledged his allegiance to Ronaldo by hitting the iconic ‘Siuuu' celebration when taking to the field and entertaining those in the crowd. Since then, Giannis has invested in Chelsea's women's team - with the Blues having excelled in WSL competition across recent campaigns.

Whether Giannis is joined in the States by Ronaldo on a long-term basis remains to be seen, as CR7 has returned to action in the Middle East, but he will be on American soil this summer when captaining Portugal at the sixth World Cup finals of his record-shattering career.

England and Scotland's World Cup group games are at risk with one designated stadium yet to be permitted a licence.

Both nations are due to play at Gillette Stadium, home of the New England Patriots, when the action kicks off in June.

England are scheduled to face Ghana there in the group stage while Scotland take on both Haiti and Morocco as they bid to qualify for the knockout rounds.

But city chiefs in Foxborough, where the stadium is situated 22 miles outside of Boston, are at odds with FIFA over the use of the 66,000-capacity stadium.

That could see world football's governing body opt to swap stadiums due to a cash row between the two parties.

Foxborough public officials want FIFA to cough up £6m to cover manpower and infrastructure costs surrounding games at this summer's tournament.

It comes after Patriots' owners, the Kraft family, refused to pay for policing and safety costs which host cities are responsible for as part of the hosting agreement.

Despite US federal funds being available to borrow to cover the costs, the Kraft family argue that the stadium is being utilised by FIFA during the tournament, they are in control of stadium preparation for the duration of the World Cup.

That includes replacing the artificial surface used in the NFL with a new grass pitch.

The Foxborough Select Board have now revealed that the required entertainment licence ‘won't be granted' unless the cash is made available.

Board head Bill Yukna said: “The town is going to stand behind the request of the money for both manpower and some capital and expense items.

“And if they aren't met, then as this board has discussed in the past, the licence won't be granted. We are going to be very clear with that.”

The fallout comes after United States president Donald Trump questioned Boston's right to host games at the World Cup.

Trump was previously embroiled in a public spat with the city's Democrat mayor.

The issue between the pair continues to bubble beneath the surface following Boston's selection as World Cup venue.

A settlement between Foxborough and FIFA is expected to be reached in due course.

The tension that has arisen over the use of Gillette Stadium row comes after multiple host cities threatened to scale back on the number of days the tournament 'Fan Fests' will be open to supporters.

Fifa had previously announced that all the fan zones would be open throughout the event.

However, local chiefs said their event at Boston's City Hall Plaza, would only be open for ‘up to 16 days'.

This is the 17th article in a series by The Athletic looking back at the winners of each men's World Cup.

Previously, we've looked at Uruguay in 1930, Italy in 1934 and again in 1938, Uruguay in 1950, West Germany in 1954, before a Brazilian double in 1958 and 1962.

Next came an England success in 1966, another Brazil win in 1970, a second West Germany triumph in 1974, Argentina's first win in 1978, Italy's third in 1982, Argentina's second in 1986, West Germany's third in 1990, Brazil going clear with a fourth World Cup in 1994 and France joining the party on home soil in 1998. Now it's time for yet another Brazilian triumph.

Three outstanding attackers, seven wins from seven matches, and a fifth World Cup. Brazil's 2002 side are remembered very fondly almost a quarter of a century on, but how good were they considered at the time?

Brazil, the only side to participate in every World Cup, came relatively close to missing out in 2002. In qualification, they lost six of their 18 games, to Paraguay, Chile, Ecuador, Uruguay, Argentina and Bolivia. There briefly seemed a very real possibility that Brazil could be forced into a two-legged play-off against Australia, or even miss out altogether, and went into their final match against Venezuela needing a victory to qualify. They managed it, with a comfortable 3-0 win.

But after a dreadful qualification campaign that featured 65 players, five different managers in the dugout, and not a single appearance from Ronaldo, Brazil just about made it to the World Cup. Their only qualification campaign as bad as this one? The most recent one.

Luiz Felipe Scolari was appointed when Brazil were in a real state, and focused on discipline — on and off the pitch — to ensure qualification for the tournament. Scolari had won the Copa Libertadores with both Gremio and Palmeiras, but had won few admirers for his style of play.

With the national side, he omitted players he suspected would cause problems, selected lots of relatively unknown domestic-based footballers as his squad members (giving playing time to his entire squad with the exception of the back-up goalkeepers), and focused on off-field harmony. He spent hours watching videos of Brazil's opponents in the build-up to the tournament — and, a little more surprisingly, formulated tactical plans by listening to the Bee Gees.

Largely unpopular going into the tournament, Scolari basically thought Brazil needed to wake up and modernise. And he was proven right. “Thirty years ago, you had one or two players who would make a difference to the game. Now we have an ensemble. If you don't have a well-organised group, you don't win,” he said. “Brazilian players have great technical ability, but are not much given to tactics. They have flashes of creativity, amazing moves, but without organisation these days, no one wins anything.”

One of his chief critics was Pele, and Scolari took great delight in rubbing Brazil's triumph in his face. “I believe that Pele knows nothing about football,” said Scolari. “He has done nothing as a coach and all his analysis always turns out to be wrong. If you want to win a title, you have to listen to Pele and then do the opposite.”

Scolari was previously regarded as a back-to-basics 4-4-2 man who liked playing with a big target man for others to feed off. But he'd never coached a side with this calibre of attackers, and to Scolari's credit, he based his side around getting the best from his three star attackers. As it became clear that he was building something exciting, the Brazilian press reported on his tactical plans with genuine shock.

The three Rs of Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho — always listed in that order — were allowed to remain in central positions, drift around, and combine at will. All three were considered the best player in the world at some point (roughly 1997, 1999, and 2005 respectively), and while they weren't quite on the level of the 1970 side in terms of their combination play, they clearly enjoyed playing together. Rivaldo had struggled to find his best form during Ronaldo's extended absence from the national side, but the No 9's return brought the best from the No 10. Ronaldinho played a little deeper, and the system was listed as both 3-4-1-2 and 3-4-2-1.

The formation brought the best from Cafu and Roberto Carlos: very good full-backs, but outstanding wing-backs. Not only did they provide the attacking width and allow the forwards to remain in positions close together, but they also had a habit of playing long crossfield balls to one another. They were, despite playing on opposite flanks, a genuine partnership.

The midfield situation was interesting. Scolari started the tournament with the disciplined Gilberto Silva — once a centre-back — in the holding midfield role, while Juninho Paulista was allowed to break forward into attack. But, as is often the case for World Cup winners, the fourth attacking player was sacrificed midway through the tournament in favour of extra midfield discipline. Juninho made way for Kleberson, who pushed forward more than Gilberto, but was a more defensive option than Juninho, a pure playmaker.

Gilberto and Kleberson formed an unfashionable midfield duo largely unknown outside Brazil. Gilberto had made his international debut the previous October, and Kleberson had made his four months before the tournament. Many in Europe would even have been unfamiliar with the names of their club sides, Atletico Mineiro and Athletico Paranaense. They were only together in the side because of the absence of captain Emerson, who dislocated his shoulder in a pre-tournament training session while filling in as a goalkeeper.

The defence was adequate rather than solid. Roque Junior was considered something of a joke figure by many Milan fans, Lucio was the hardman but made a terrible error to let in Michael Owen to open the scoring in the quarter-final, while Edmilson pushed forward at times and provided the best example of joga bonito with a superb overhead kick in a 5-2 group stage win over Costa Rica.



Ronaldo — although up until the semi-final stage, the focus was on the three Rs rather than any individual.

Both Ronaldo and Rivaldo had scored once in each of Brazil's first four matches, while Rivaldo kept up his record by scoring in the quarter-final win over England. Later in that game, Ronaldinho scored the winner in a 2-1 win with his memorable ‘did he mean it?' free kick that sailed over David Seaman and in. Shortly after that, however, he was sent off and therefore suspended for the semi-final.

Rivaldo, meanwhile, wasn't overwhelmingly popular due to his embarrassing playacting to get Turkish defender Hakan Unsal sent off in a group game, but he was at least as good as Ronaldo. World Soccer magazine called him “consistently Brazil's best player over the seven games”.

At the semi-final stage, Ronaldo took charge, scoring a toe-poked finish which caught out Turkey goalkeeper Rustu Recber and then both goals in the final. By the end, it was Ronaldo's tournament.

That was partly because he'd scored eight goals in seven matches, the most in a World Cup since Gerd Muller in 1970, and partly because it was such a great story after what happened in the 1998 final.

Ronaldo didn't score for Brazil between September 1999 and a pre-tournament friendly in May 2002 because of repeated knee injuries. He'd played only 17 games for Inter in the three seasons leading up to this tournament. It's difficult to think of another footballer who has missed such a substantial part of his career and returned to such a high level — Ronaldo wasn't quite as explosive as during the 1998 tournament, but he was livelier than anyone expected and remained an outstanding finisher. After the final, he was keen to credit his physiotherapist, Nilton Petrone.

Ronaldo won that year's Ballon d'Or ahead of his team-mate Roberto Carlos, who was favoured by some, having won both the European Cup and World Cup. Ronaldo's triumph was solely about the World Cup. In the calendar year, he scored only nine league goals; four with Inter before the tournament, and five with Real Madrid, having forced a transfer shortly afterwards. This angered many at Inter, who had waited three years for him to find fitness, had celebrated his superb tournament, then found him desperate to leave the club immediately.

The strangest thing about the final between Brazil and Germany was that it was their first-ever World Cup meeting, despite the fact that they were the two most successful nations in its history, with four and three victories apiece at this stage.

Germany were not a particularly good side, and were overwhelmingly reliant on attacking midfielder Michael Ballack, who scored the winner in 1-0 victories over the USA and South Korea in the quarter-final and semi-final. In the latter, he also received a booking that put him out of the final. Without their best outfielder, Germany stood little chance.

They did, at least, have the man who had been voted the tournament's best player on the eve of the final — goalkeeper Oliver Kahn. But the World Cup final during this period had a curious habit of making the main man the fall guy: Roberto Baggio in 1994, Ronaldo in 1998, Kahn here, and — spoiler alert — Zinedine Zidane in 2006. When Kahn fumbled Rivaldo's shot from the edge of the box, Ronaldo was on hand to convert the rebound.

Germany offered little attacking threat, although a 30-yard Oliver Neuville free kick was turned onto the post by goalkeeper Marcos. Brazil dominated without ever turning on the style, although their second goal was a rare example of good combination football, when Rivaldo dummied a pass from Kleberson — probably the best player in the final — for Ronaldo to slide home a second goal and ensure that this was his final.

The trophy was lifted by Cafu, who had become the first and only man to play in three World Cup finals. He stood up on the somewhat wobbly plinth to lift the trophy, with ‘100% Jardim Irene' — the name of his hometown — scribbled on his shirt, and mouthed ‘I love you' to his wife as he held aloft Brazil's fifth, and most recent, World Cup.

“Brazil are a wonderful team,” said Germany manager Rudi Voller. “They deserved to be world champions.”

More than his two simple finishes in the final, it was Ronaldo's semi-final winner against Turkey that probably lives longest in the memory.

There's no doubt it was an error by Recber — another goalkeeper who had been excellent until one fatal error — but given his injury problems, there was something deeply satisfying about watching Ronaldo being, well, Ronaldo. He came short to receive the ball, showed a decent turn of speed, and then surprised Rustu with a toe-poked finish, which brought to mind his old strike partner Romario (hero in 1994, out injured in 1998, and controversially omitted here).

There were other great moments, too: Edmilson's overhead kick against Costa Rica, Rivaldo's calm finish to equalise against England after some classic Ronaldinho trickery, and then Ronaldinho's free-kick winner later in that game.

Yes, without question, especially given they won all seven games without the need for extra time or penalties.

But they were helped by the fact that the other pre-tournament contenders completely flopped. Joint-favourites France and Argentina, who both had exceptional records coming into the World Cup, both failed to get out of their group. The other two sides ranked ahead of Brazil in the pre-tournament betting, Italy and Spain, both fell to co-hosts South Korea. Of the traditionally strong nations, Brazil only needed to get past England and Germany, neither of whom had a particularly golden generation at this point.

None of this is Brazil's fault, but there were clear flaws in this side that weren't exposed in a strange World Cup with plenty of great stories, but very few great sides.

February 15, 2026

Nigeria's hopes of qualifying for the 2026 FIFA World Cup hang in the balance as FIFA prepares to deliver a crucial ruling on Monday, February 16, on the country's eligibility protest against DR Congo.

The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) lodged a formal complaint on December 15, 2025, alleging that six DR Congo players who featured in the November 2025 African playoff final were ineligible due to recent switches in international allegiance.

Nigeria were eliminated from direct qualification in heartbreaking fashion after losing 4–3 on penalties following a tense playoff encounter, effectively ending the Super Eagles' World Cup campaign—unless FIFA rules in their favour.

NFF General Secretary Dr. Mohammed Sanusi expressed confidence in the federation's case. “We have a good case,” he said. “We do not venture into what would be an exercise in futility. As far as we are concerned, we have a strong case, and we are awaiting FIFA's decision on the complaints we have lodged.”

Super Eagles midfielder Alex Iwobi also shared the optimism among players and fans. “We are still waiting; hopefully, we can go to the World Cup,” he told reporters.

If FIFA rules in Nigeria's favour, the Super Eagles would be reinstated and advance to the six-team Intercontinental Play-Off tournament scheduled for March in Mexico. A top finish in that playoff would secure one of the remaining African slots at the 2026 World Cup, co-hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

As the verdict approaches, Nigerians have taken to social media to share mixed reactions, ranging from hope and anticipation to criticism and skepticism.

“We are waiting but Nigeria doesn't deserve to be at the World Cup through the back door. Dr Congo should fought for the ticket,” wrote @YahuzaAmadu.

“I like how big Nigerians dream. How is it even possible that Dr Congo will make such mistake knowing fully well that they will be disqualified?” asked @obikrasi.

“Nigerians from time immemorial likes to ‘hope'. Let see how it's pans out,” added @Ezy3030.

Others believe the ruling could favour Nigeria. “Both footballing terms and economical viability FIFA would always choose Nigeria, but whatever happens at the end, one thing is crystal clear rules of the game must properly adhere to irrespective even if DR Congo has CAF Secretary General on their arms,” said @iAmPODii.

“Oh wow. People must know something that we don't know. I can't wait to see/hear what that ruling is going to be. I really just cannot wait at all. I just hope it is what we are all expecting it to be. Next week is around the corner. We'd wait,” wrote @GreenwayRecords.

Some fans expressed fatigue over the uncertainty. “They should do this thing once and for all, we are tired of holding a calculator every time we hear FIFA,” said @abn_tel.

Others questioned the fairness of a potential reinstatement. “Well let's see but if Nigeria later made there way to world cup I don't think it's fair because they don't really deserve it,” posted @Rouphages.

Supporters, however, remain hopeful. “I pray it is in Nigeria favour Omo e go too sweet,” wrote @THEALONE__BOY, while another added, “We deserve the spot more considering our performance at the afcon.”

A turbulent period for Marseille has delivered more drama, with disgruntled supporters trying to storm presidential suites at Stade Velodrome. A furious stampede took place following a 2-2 draw with Strasbourg in Ligue 1. Said contest saw Mason Greenwood among the goals again, but Marseille threw away a commanding lead to drop two points in dramatic fashion.

Ex-Manchester United forward Greenwood appeared to have put Marseille on their way to a welcome win when opening the scoring inside 14 minutes. Amine Gouiri added a second early in the second half, but a late collapse was to be suffered.

Strasbourg found a route back into the game with 73 minutes on the clock, before restoring parity through Joaquin Panichelli when a 97th-minute penalty was awarded. Unsurprisingly, as the final whistle blew moments later, those in the stands were less than impressed with what they witnessed.

La Provence were on hand to report on what happened next. They reported that “tensions rose even further around the Stade Velodrome” after seeing Marseille held to a draw on home soil.

They went on to add that: “After demanding the departure of the club's management through banners and chants, some supporters attempted to enter the presidential suites. As a security measure, access to the Jean-Bouin stand was subsequently closed.”

Calm was “subsequently restored”, but those in power at Marseille have been offered another reminder of how supporters are growing tired with questionable performances on and off the field.

Stalemate against Strasbourg has left Marseille fourth in the Ligue 1 table, 12 points adrift of leaders Lens. They are working under the guidance of caretaker coach Jacques Abardonado following the dismissal of Roberto De Zerbi as manager on February 11.

The former Brighton boss was relieved of his duties in the wake of a 5-0 drubbing by arch-rivals Paris Saint-Germain in Le Classique. Reports in France claimed that De Zerbi's “relationship with his players had become strained and the Italian knew he was leaving”.

It is claimed that the Italian's position had “become untenable”. Late-night talks were held regarding his future, with the decision ultimately taken to part ways.

RMC Sport, citing a ‘friend' of De Zerbi, claimed that De Zerbi knew his time was up “on the evening of the match in Paris” - as he admitted afterwards to having “no answers” and that he “did not understand his team”.

De Zerbi is a demanding character and is said to have been left “devastated” by the attitude of his players following their demoralising Champions League exit - which came on the back of a 3-0 defeat to Club Brugge on the final matchday.

He aired his frustration on a regular basis, with fans sharing those concerns. De Zerbi had been under contract until 2027, but Marseille said in an official statement that announced his departure: “Following discussions between all stakeholders in the club's management - the owner, president, director of football, and coach - it was decided to make a change at the helm of the first team. This was a difficult collective decision, taken after careful consideration in the best interests of the club, in order to respond to the sporting challenges of the end of the season.

“Olympique de Marseille would like to thank Roberto De Zerbi for his dedication, commitment, professionalism, and seriousness, which were particularly evident in the team's second-place finish in the 2024/25 season. The club wishes him all the best for the rest of his career.”

Supporters would appear to be of the opinion that further change is required, with prominent figures being urged to vacate roles in the boardroom. More protests will be held in the weeks to come.

It is up to Greenwood and Co to calm matters on the pitch, with the one-cap England international enjoying another productive season as an individual. On the back of savouring Golden Boot honours last season, Greenwood has posted a career-best return of 23 goals this term. Marseille will be back in action on Friday when taking in a trip to Brest.

Cesc Fabregas launched a stunning rant towards Como striker Alvaro Morata on Saturday after the Spaniard picked up two yellow cards in two minutes to see his marching orders in his side's 2-1 defeat to Fiorentina. Morata had been introduced as a second-half substitute but lost his cool to pick up two rapid bookings as his side searched for an equaliser, leading to harsh criticism from Fabregas, who suggested the striker should "change careers".

Morata was introduced for Como – where he is currently on loan from AC Milan – in the 57th minute with his side 2-0 down in the Serie A encounter at Stadio Giuseppe Sinigaglia. With Como seeking a European place while Fiorentina battle relegation, the home side halved the deficit in the 77th minute through Fabiano Parisi's own goal before Morata's madness took over and decided the outcome.

The 33-year-old talked himself into his first booking of the match in the 88th minute before taking things further just 60 seconds later, putting his head towards Luca Ranieri off the ball to send the Fiorentina ace to the ground. Morata earnt himself a second yellow card and dismissal with mere minutes remaining in the game.

Fabregas was, understandably, furious with his former Chelsea team-mate Morata at the final whistle and questioned the player's mindless sending off in his side's costly defeat.

Fabregas told reporters: “Provocation is part of football. Those who don't tolerate provocation have to change careers.

“He's an experienced player, I expect more from him, because the line between winning and losing is very thin.

“I don't like excuses. We have to play our own game. What others say shouldn't matter to us.”

Former Barcelona, Chelsea and Arsenal midfielder Fabregas continued on his side's defeat to Fiorentina: “I'm annoyed that I wasn't able to help the boys understand the importance of the game. I showed them my experience as a footballer during the week, maybe too much, but it wasn't enough. We're a young team.

“It wasn't a football match in the second half. Leaving that aside, the game has to be won with the right motivation and energy.

"I feel bad as a coach, because I wasn't able to convey this to my players today. Maybe it was in our heads. We made a mistake in our attitude, we have to show more desire. I didn't like the first half very much, the second half, I repeat, wasn't a game of football."

A journeyman player in the truest sense of the word, Morata has played for some of the biggest clubs across Europe while struggling to find himself a long-term home.

The former Chelsea flop signed for a then-record £70million ($95.5m) fee from Real Madrid in 2017 but managed just 24 goals and six assists in 72 appearances, struggling to adapt to the Premier League and eventually moving on to Atletico Madrid two years later.

Currently on his second loan spell away from AC Milan, Spain Euro 2024-winning captain Morata has largely played understudy to Tasos Douvikas at Como and has managed just one goal and two assists in 18 appearances in all competitions. His latest exploits in getting himself sent off and costing his side are unlikely to help his standing with Fabregas, whose scathing comments reflect the reality of a player who should be setting a far better example at this stage of his career.

Morata was dropped from Luis de la Fuente's Spain squad in October for the first time since 2018, and is facing an increasing battle to return to form in time to earn a place in La Roja's World Cup squad in the United States, Canada and Mexico this summer.

The 87-cap striker captained his nation to glory in 2024 and to be omitted from this summer's squad entirely would be major news – but he must quickly make things right with Fabregas and Como in order to return to form at club level first. Morata also recently split from wife Alice Campello, in a challenging period for the Spaniard both on and off the pitch.

Reports in Italy suggest that the International Football Association Board (IFAB) will move to change a major VAR rule in time for the 2026 FIFA World Cup in North America following the controversial scenes during Saturday evening's Derby d'Italia between Inter and Juventus. 

Inter claimed a 3-2 victory in the derby thanks to an own goal from Andrea Cambiaso and individual efforts from Pio Esposito and Piotr Zielinski, but their victory has been somewhat overshadowed by the refereeing controversy that led to the first-half sending off of Juventus defender Pierre Kalulu. 

Kalulu was sent off in the 42nd minute for two bookable offences. There have been suggestions that his original yellow, for a foul on Nicolo Barella, was slightly harsh, but the second has been deemed ‘non-existent' and ‘absurd' by newspapers in Italy on Sunday. 

That is because Inter's Alessandro Bastoni was deemed to have dived in an attempt to get Kalulu sent off. Referee Federico La Penna did not hesitate in his decision to show Kalulu his second yellow, and as this was not a straight red card incident, VAR could not intervene. 

According to reports from La Gazzetta dello Sport, the IFAB, the body responsible for managing and updating the laws of the game, will review whether or not VAR should be allowed to intervene on second yellow card offences at its next annual assembly. 

This is a topic that was already raised during a recent IFAB meeting on January 20, and will be reviewed at the annual assembly in Cardiff, Wales on February 28. 

La Gazzetta dello Sport reports that the signals indicate towards IFAB voting in favour of allowing VAR to intervene on second yellow card offences, and that this new change in rules could come into effect in time for the 2026 FIFA World Cup in North America. 

Peter Young is a Senior Reporter with Football Italia.

Who really wants more VAR?  It's only a week since VAR wrongly advised an added time penalty winner.

 Nigeria lost to DR Congo in the World Cup qualificcation play-offs

The Federation of International Football Association (FIFA) is set to deliver a verdict on Nigeria's protest against the Democratic Republic of Congo over player eligibility in the 2026 World Cup qualifiers on February 16.

The controversy stems from a petition reportedly submitted by the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), questioning the eligibility of several DR Congo players who were born or raised abroad but now represent the Central African nation at the international level.

The argument is that DR Congo's constitution does not permit dual nationality, yet several of its internationals are believed to retain foreign citizenship.

According to Nigerian outlet Daily Post, FIFA has set Monday, February 16, 2026, as the date the verdict will be released following the conclusion of investigations.

It has been reported that Nigerians are hopeful they will automatically inherit the slot if the ruling goes in their favour, allowing them to represent Africa in the Intercontinental play-offs scheduled for March 2026.

Recently, NFF General Secretary Dr Mohammed Sanusi, after submitting the petition, stated that they have a concrete case and are hopeful of a favourable outcome.

“We have a good case. We don't go into things that would be a waste of time. We believe we have a strong case, and we are waiting for FIFA's decision on our complaints,” he said.

Meanwhile, DR Congo has denied the allegations made by the West African country, labelling them “bad losers” and accusing them of acting desperately after losing in the play-offs.

The hosting agreement requires cities to cover these costs, though federal borrowing options are available.

Foxborough officials have made clear they will not budge from their position, creating a significant headache for organisers with the tournament fast approaching.

Seven matches are scheduled for the Massachusetts stadium, located approximately 22 miles southwest of Boston.

These include crucial fixtures for both home nations.

Scotland face Haiti and Morocco in their opening two group encounters at the venue.

England are due to meet Ghana there on June 23.

Foxborough Select Board remains unmoved by such arguments

GETTY

The dispute could force Fifa to make a last-minute venue change if negotiations fail to reach an agreement.

It had been widely expected that the Kraft family, owners of NFL franchise the New England Patriots who call Gillette Stadium home, would underwrite the associated costs, but they have declined to do so.

The Kraft family maintain that the stadium falls under Fifas jurisdiction for the duration of the competition.

The governing body will assume control of preparations from next month, including laying a new grass surface to replace the existing artificial pitch.

FIFA World Cup

However, the Foxborough Select Board remains unmoved by such arguments.

Board head Bill Yukna said: "The town is going to stand behind the request of the money for both manpower and some capital and expense items.

"And if they aren't met, then as this board has discussed in the past, the license won't be granted. 

"We are going to be very clear with that."

This latest dispute adds to a pattern of difficulties surrounding the Boston area's involvement in the tournament.

US President Donald Trump publicly questioned the city's right to host matches last year following a disagreement with Boston's Democrat mayor, though that matter appeared resolved when venues were confirmed after December's draw.

Tensions are also evident elsewhere, with several host cities scaling back their commitments to tournament fan zones.

Fifa had announced that supporter gathering areas would operate throughout the competition, yet Boston officials have indicated their fan fest outside City Hall Plaza would be open for a maximum of 16 days rather than the full duration.

Roony Bardghji is finding out the hard way that life at the top of the European game can be as cruel as it is rewarding. The Swedish sensation, who arrived in Catalonia with a burgeoning reputation as one of the continent's most exciting young attackers, has once again drifted into the shadows at Barcelona. Despite a packed schedule that has seen the Blaugrana navigate a relentless run of fixtures across La Liga, the Champions League, and domestic cups, Roony has found himself surplus to requirements in Hansi Flick's immediate tactical setup.

The numbers make for grim reading for the 20-year-old international. In the 12 matches Barcelona have contested since the turn of the year, Roony has featured in just five. Even more concerning is the breakdown of his playing time; he has accumulated a mere 160 minutes on the pitch out of a possible 500 across the entire calendar year. For a player of his calibre and potential, the lack of involvement during a "frenetic" start to 2026 suggests a significant disconnect between his current form and the demands of the first team.

This isn't the first time the Swede has been relegated to the role of spectator this season. A similar drought occurred between November 9 and December 2, when he failed to register a single minute of action against Celta Vigo, Athletic Club, Chelsea, Alaves, and Atletico Madrid. While he briefly reclaimed a spot in the rotation following that spell, even earning two starts, the momentum has completely evaporated. The "disappearing act" is becoming a worrying trend for a player who needs consistent minutes to continue his development in one of the world's most demanding environments.

Even when he does get onto the pitch, the cameos have been fleeting. Recent appearances against Real Oviedo and Mallorca saw him restricted to little more than ten minutes per game, essentially serving as a late-game filler rather than a genuine tactical option. For Roony, the struggle to break back into the fold is magnified by the high stakes of Barca's current campaign, where every point and every cup tie feels like a crossroads for Flick's evolving project in Catalunya.

The elephant in the room for Roony is the meteoric and undeniable rise of Lamine Yamal. Occupying the same preferred right-wing position, Yamal has become an untouchable pillar of the Barcelona XI. The Mataro-born wonderkid is a phenomenon who rarely rests, with Flick starting him even in Copa del Rey matches where rotation might typically be expected. As long as Yamal continues to put defenses to the sword, the path to the starting lineup remains effectively blocked for the Swedish youngster.

The challenge of competing with Yamal was perfectly illustrated during the recent Copa del Rey defeat to Atletico Madrid, where the teenager remained the focal point of the attack even in the face of heavy pressure from Diego Simeone's side. Roony is reportedly well aware of the hierarchy, and to his credit, the player has never voiced his frustrations publicly. Flick, for his part, continues to shower the Swede with praise in press conferences, maintaining that he remains a valued member of the squad despite the lack of evidence on the pitch.

Beyond the internal competition, Barcelona's strategic interests in the transfer market also cast a long shadow over the current squad's fringe players. The club is constantly linked with elite reinforcements to bolster their attacking ranks, further squeezing the space available for developing talent. Atletico Madrid president Enrique Cerezo recently addressed rumours regarding one such target, stating: "Julian is a player under contract with Atletico Madrid and he is happy. No one from Barca has officially contacted us about signing him, and that's all there is to it."

Despite Cerezo's firm stance, the mere fact that Barca are scouting world-class forwards like Julian Alvarez highlights the difficulty Roony faces. To maintain his status at the Estadi Olimpic, he must prove he can provide a viable alternative to the starters. Right now, he is caught in a holding pattern, waiting for an injury or a drastic dip in form from those ahead of him to provide a window of opportunity that feels more distant with each passing week.

The lack of rotation and the continued omission of players like Roony has started to draw scrutiny, particularly when the results don't go Barcelona's way. Following the heavy first-leg loss in the Copa del Rey semi-finals, Flick has faced questions about his system and his reliance on a core group of players. The manager has been forced to defend his choices, admitting: "We didn't play well. We have to go to the second game. It will be very difficult but we are going to fight it. We talked at half-time about the different situations and that we should do better. We didn't see the team I want to see in the first half. I ask why it is offside. I don't know what they have decided. We have to accept it but I don't agree."

Flick's frustration is evident, but his reluctance to turn to Roony during these moments of crisis suggests a lack of trust in the player's current readiness. With a return leg at the Camp Nou on the horizon and the title race heating up, the German coach is sticking to his guns. For Roony Bardghji, the challenge remains simple but incredibly difficult: find a way to make himself indispensable during the few minutes he is afforded, or face a future where his "disappearing act" becomes a permanent feature of his Barcelona career.

Fawaz Al-Hasawi, the former owner of Nottingham Forest, is recovering after being stabbed by masked robbers during a home invasion. The attack took place at Al-Hasawi's London mansion worth a reported £10 million ($13.7m). The Kuwaiti businessman is best known in England for his time in charge of Forest, purchasing the club in 2012 before selling it on five years later.

According to The Sun, the attack took place earlier this month. Al-Hasawi is said to have been sleeping when robbers broke into his bedroom. During a confrontation, the 57-year-old sustained stab wounds to his hand left hand and other injuries to his neck. Images circulating on social media have pictured Al-Hasawi in hospital with bandages over his injuries.

It is currently unknown if the robbers managed to steal anything from Al-Hasawi's property in the Mayfair district of London before fleeing immediately after this confrontation.

Al-Hasawi's lawyers are said to have asked the Metropolitan Police to publicly reveal more about the attack as other Middle Eastern businessmen are 'fearing' similar attacks. The Metropolitan Police insist that inquiries are ongoing, but have assured that Al-Hasawi did not sustain any 'life-threatening or life-changing' injuries during this home invasion.

Al-Hasawi's five years at the helm of Forest were particularly volatile, with the club going from Championship promotion hopefuls to flirting with relegation. He employed nine different managers during his half-decade stint at the City Ground.

In 2017, having faced many protests in his final years at the club, Al-Hasawi sold Forest to Greek businessman Evangelos Marinakis, who helped the club return to the Premier League in 2022.

Though Forest have achieved the Premier League dream under Marinakis' ownership, he has come in for criticism over the handling of this season. Forest qualified for the Europa League having finished seventh last season and came into this campaign full of hope. However, they have already cycled their way through three managers - Nuno Espirito Santo, Ange Postecoglou and Sean Dyche - before the appointment of Vitor Pereira as their fourth of 2025-26.

Nevertheless, Marinakis, known for meeting players in the tunnel and even coming onto the City Ground pitch, remains a hugely popular figure among Forest fans, with former player Rob Earnshaw telling GOAL that football needs larger-than-life personalities like his.

"When Mr Marinakis comes on the pitch and he's greeting players in the tunnel, for me there is absolutely nothing wrong with that," Earnshaw said, speaking in association with NordicBet, where fans can follow the latest Europa League odds.

"Also, in Greece, when you are the owner, you are entitled to go in the dressing room, to go on the pitch, it's part of the game as you come and be part of it - you speak with the players and you are the man in the middle. As the owner, you get a better feeling of what's going on inside the football club.

"I have no problem with it and think Mr Marinakis has done a fantastic job. He is of course very ruthless and very determined, very direct in his ways, but he has taken this football club - in the last five/six years - into where it should be, in the Premier League, playing in Europe and having big European nights, playing in the Premier League and having the chance to go to the Champions League. Those moments are what every Forest fan wants to happen.

"I enjoy it. I enjoy him being involved. I think it's been unbelievable and he deserves a lot of credit because he hasn't just invested in the football club, he has fully invested himself in order to take the club to be successful. It has been a hell of a journey, a hell of a few years, but it wouldn't be Forest if it was boring and we didn't have personalities.

"Football is about personalities, so I love that. They shouldn't just be sat there and you never hear from them in the box. They are part of the football club and their personality comes out. I'm all for that."

SEATTLE — Downtown Seattle was filled with cheering fans as the Seahawks' championship parade and trophy ceremony drew tens of thousands to Lumen Field on Wednesday. While fans celebrated, city and event leaders were already looking ahead, using the event to test systems and coordination for future large-scale events, including this summer's FIFA World Cup.

Beth Knox, president and CEO of the Seattle Sports Commission, said the parade offered key lessons. 

"In comparison to the 2014 Super Bowl victory parade, when we didn't have bicycle barricades along the route, that actually slowed the parade down because there was a sea of people, and it wasn't safe," she said. "Putting bicycle barricades along the parade route this year helped keep fans safe and allowed the parade to keep moving, so fans didn't have to wait as long to see their heroes with the team. That was one great improvement."

Planning involved multiple agencies, including the Seahawks, Seafair, and departments like the King County Sheriff's Office, Amtrak, Metro, and Sound Transit.

The event also provided a test run for World Cup preparations, Knox said. Collaboration with the Seattle Police Department enabled agencies to practice coordination, communication, and traffic management.

"It makes it so much easier when you are executing on a World Cup, because relationships have been developed, systems are now in place, and understanding where there might be traffic congestion or a better traffic flow," she said. "Once you see it in action, then you can apply it to the next event."

About 50,000 fans attended the trophy ceremony at Lumen Field, and hotels were at capacity the night before the parade.

Knox noted that community partnerships were crucial. Organizations such as Friends of the Waterfront, the Downtown Seattle Association, the Chamber of Commerce, and Visit Seattle provided consistent information and support for event activations. Local businesses, especially restaurants and hotels, also benefited from the influx of visitors.

The Sports Commission will host the "Region Ready Summit" on February 23, bringing together community groups, businesses, tourism and hospitality organizations, sports entities, and local government to review best practices. Speakers from Vancouver, B.C., will share experiences from previous World Cups and major events.

"People around the world get to see the incredible joy, unity, and inclusiveness that make up our region," Knox said. "Those are our core values, and it really reminds the rest of the world what an amazing place Seattle is."

The 2026 World Cup schedule in Seattle:

The World Cup's knockout rounds will also make a stop in the Emerald City. A Round of 32 match is locked in for July 1 at 1 p.m. PT, followed by a Round of 16 contest on July 6 at 5 p.m. PT.

Persistence eventually paid off for Alex de Minaur at the ABN AMRO Open on Sunday.

The top-seeded Australian fittingly produced his sharpest performance of the week to defeat Felix Auger-Aliassime 6-3, 6-2 and secure his maiden indoor title at the ATP 500 event. De Minaur fell in the past two Rotterdam finals, but he was crisp and clinical in all departments against Auger-Aliassime, who required an off-court medical timeout midway through the second set.

“That's what it's all about: just doing my best to rise to the occasion,” De Minaur said of his final performance, in which he did not face a break point, according to Infosys ATP Stats. “As the tournament goes on, you try and find ways out of solutions and try to give yourself the best chance to play better the following day, and I did exactly that. I'm super pleased with the performance today.

“Third time lucky... I'm super stoked, super happy. It ended up being a great week here in Rotterdam. It's a place where I always feel really good. I was just a step short in the previous years, so it feels great to finally be able to lift the title."

Auger-Aliassime was on an eight-match winning streak having lifted the title in Montpellier last week. The Canadian was targeting a ninth career indoor title to further strengthening his reputation as one of the most dangerous players under a roof. De Minaur, however, has been a consistent force at ATP 500 level in recent years, and his title charge in the Rotterdam final proved too much for the Canadian.

“Congrats to Alex and your team,” Auger-Aliassime said during the trophy presentation. “We've played a lot of matches throughout the years… I tried my best today, but you were just a little bit too good. [It's your] third time in the final here, so congrats on the win.”

After a cagey start between the tournament's top two seeds, the final ignited in the sixth game of the opening set when De Minaur struck two inspired winners to earn the decisive break — the first time Auger-Aliassime's serve had been breached since his second-round win over Stan Wawrinka in Montpellier.

De Minaur carried his momentum into the second set and broke again in the fifth game, stepping inside the baseline and dictating rallies with increased aggression. Shortly after, Auger-Aliassime left the court for medical treatment and returned looking short of his usual explosiveness. De Minaur sensed his opportunity and remained ruthless, closing out the match to reduce his Lexus ATP Head2Head deficit against the Canadian to 2-3.

With his 78-minute win, De Minaur also jumped two spots to No. 6 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings.

 Given Carlos Alcaraz is the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings and has just completed the Career Grand Slam with his Australian Open win, he could be forgiven for sitting back and admiring his work so far in 2026. 

 The Spaniard, of course, has other ideas. Alcaraz is infused with the relentless desire to improve that has always characterised the greatest players in tennis history, and that is what will be at the forefront of his mind next week when he returns to action as the top seed at the Qatar ExxonMobil Open in Doha. 

 “Obviously I can see myself that [I have had] a lot of success so far, winning the biggest tournaments in the world,” said Alcaraz on Sunday at his pre-tournament press conference in Qatar. “But I just see myself with weaknesses. A lot of players, I know that they're trying to catch me up in terms of they are studying my game, they study how I play, trying to beat me, trying to challenge me. 

 “I have to be ready for that, and I have to see where my level is, where my tennis is. I have to try to put myself in their minds and think what they could do when playing against me. So that's what I mean about saying I have to improve some things. Obviously, you cannot be lagging in the level, you just have to keep it going.” 

 One obvious example of the rivals Alcaraz was referring to is Jannik Sinner. The Italian lines up as the second seed in the Doha field, presenting the possibility of a 17th chapter of the pair's electric Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalry in the championship match. Yet the 22-year-old Alcaraz has no intention of getting ahead of himself as he looks to better the quarter-final run he forged on Doha debut a year ago. 

 “I know how difficult every match is. Every match is different, our play is totally different,” said the Spaniard, who takes on Top 30 star Arthur Rinderknech in his opener. “I think this draw is a really tough one for a 500 tournament. We can see the first matches how good matches that we have in the first round. 

 “So [I'm] just thinking about a match at a time, and let's see how far I can go. Obviously my mind is trying to go as far as I can. If it's possible to play a final, obviously that would be great, and that's what I'm looking for, so let's see. I'm not thinking about playing or just putting myself in the final too early. I want to think day by day.”

 Alcaraz headed to Doha with a 7-0 record for the season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, following his Melbourne title run. He first enjoyed a stopoff in Bahrain, where he visited his fellow Spanish sporting superstars Fernando Alonso and Carlos Sainz at F1 pre-season testing, but his focus has now fully shifted to trying to take his game to even greater heights in the Qatari capital. 

 “Coming here, these days, my team and I, just we set up some goals for this tournament,” revealed the 25-time tour-level champion. “We are not talking about results at all. It's just more about the process to be better, still in the process to grow up. There are some things that I really want to be better and [I want to] develop my game in a way that I really want to show up and to pull off here in this tournament. 

 “That would be a really successful week for me, besides results. I [want to] see myself that I'm just doing the right things on and off the court.”

Ben Shelton survived a major test from fellow lefty Denis Shapovalov on Saturday at the Nexo Dallas Open, where he prevailed in a final-set tie-break to reach the final. The second seed defeated the defending champion 4-6, 6-4, 7-6(4).

"It was a gritty win. A lot of credit to Denis the way he's playing on this court," Shelton said. "It's a freight train coming at you."

The second-seeded Shelton demonstrated impressive resilience under pressure throughout the clash. He saved 10 of the 11 break points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats, including a crucial save with a clutch volley at 2-2 in the second set and another save at 5-5 in the third set. With the win, he took a 4-0 lead in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

Shelton will face top seed Taylor Fritz in the final. This will be the first final between the top two seeds at the tournament since 2018, when top seed Kevin Anderson defeated second seed Sam Querrey in New York, where the tournament was previously held.

"I've really made a concerted effort to show up to each tournament this year with the mindset that I want to win it," Shelton said. "I'm there, each and every match, putting myself in the position that I need to compete at the highest levels."



Fritz halted the run of a resurgent Marin Cilic in the semi-finals of the Nexo Dallas  Open on Saturday. 

In a match decided by fine margins, the top seed held his nerve to edge the Croatian 7-6(5), 7-6(3) in a gripping two-hour, two-minute clash, hammering 22 aces past the 37-year-old.

"Just really calm serving. I think that's the biggest thing when I feel calm and relaxed, I serve well," Fritz said in his on-court interview.

Both players dominated with big deliveries in a match that featured no breaks. Fritz did not face a break point and struck 22 aces to Cilic's 16, including four in the first-set tie-break, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Although he failed to convert any of his five break-point chances, Fritz's composure on serve ultimately made the difference as he won 86 per cent (48/56) of his first-serve points.

“That's something every tennis player experiences when you're the one in the opponent's service games," Fritz said. "You have some chances, you're cruising on your service games and all of a sudden they get one break point, you'll probably win it. You'll go to the tie-break, all of a sudden some returns came back and I just told myself to be really ready in that tie-break."

With the win, Fritz took a 3-1 lead in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series and advanced to his first final on home soil after reaching the US Open final in 2024.

Cilic was hoping to reach his first final above the ATP 250 level since winning the Queen's Club title in 2018. With his semi-final run in Dallas, the Croat is up 18 spots to No. 43 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings.

The reality TV personality announced his bid to join the 2026 race in January. "L.A. does not need another unqualified and inexperienced mayor," writes his sister in a series of tweets.


							By 

	Jackie Strause


Managing Editor, East Coast


	Stephanie Pratt is calling out brother Spencer Pratt‘s campaign for Los Angeles mayor, saying a vote for the reality television star is a “vote for stupidity.”


	In a series of tweets shared over the weekend, the former star of MTV‘s The Hills launched a tirade of posts against her brother containing her reasoning for why he should not be elected, along with some allegations against him, including a claim of assault. After Spencer and wife Heidi Montag lost their home in the Palisades fire more than a year ago, the reality TV fixture has emerged as an influential and controversial public policy critic. The parents of two filed a lawsuit against the city over damage from the wildfires, and Spencer Pratt announced his bid to join the 2026 L.A. mayoral race as a populist outsider in January. The election will be held June 2.

	“Spencer has done great work for the palisades. But LA does not need another unqualified and inexperienced mayor. A vote for him is a vote for stupidity,” began Stephanie Pratt on Saturday night on her Twitter. “He's just trying to stay famous and sell his memoir don't be fooled. In an ideal world the palisades would have their own mayor and police department. I would love him to be mayor of Palisades but not LA with 4 million people. I'd be impressed if a republican could turn LA democrats thb [sic].”


	Stephanie then referenced her brother's past, saying L.A.'s mayor should be someone “who wasn't in a cult.” After people on Twitter began responding to her tweets, she then alleged, “Sorry he beat me up when I was 18 & put me in the hospital. So no he doesn't belong in the government” and claimed “he's the one who got me hooked on hard core drugs at 15. I've kept this all a secret for years. He also had a hidden drug addiction.”

	











	She then continued, referencing a 2010 incident, “did anyone know after the cult they went to Costa Rica and were arrested for illegal firearms? He called my dad from jail after not speaking to our family for 8 years bc of his cult, to bail him out … I have no interest in fame, I'm taking a course to become a RBT my passion is helping children and adults with autism. I don't even use instagram. I'm serious about my new career helping people.”


	Spencer, 42, sister Stephanie Pratt, 39, and Spencer's wife Heidi Pratt, 39, all starred on MTV's hit reality series The Hills, which aired from 2006 to 2010, and was rebooted in 2019 with The Hills: New Beginnings. Spencer famously had a villainous persona on the reality series and in the public spotlight, and his feuding with sister Stephanie was chronicled both on- and off-screen. 


	Amid his new campaign and with his memoir, The Guy You Loved to Hate, he's taken to referring to his competitors with bullying nicknames and has revisited the fakery of MTV's unscripted The Hills, as well as wife Heidi's well-publicized plastic surgery.


	“Yes fact – I will always be on team Lauren Conrad,” Stephanie Pratt continued, referring to the famous feud between Spencer, Heidi Pratt and their former Hills co-star. “Those two spent years trying to destroy her life for magazine covers,” she claimed. “I always side with the vulnerable who need help not the people inflicting pain on others.”


	She added, “Leopards never change their spots. Stay in the palisades Spencer.”

					By Melanie Goodfellow 

Senior International Film Correspondent


David Kaplan, producer of Beth de Araújo's Sundance breakout Josephine, has praised the commitment of Channing Tatum and Gemma Chan to the indie project. 


	Tatum (Roofman) and Chan (Crazy Rich Asians) co-star as the parents of the eight-year-old protagonist Josephine, whose life is upended when she witnesses a violent sexual assault at San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, played by big screen debutant Mason Reeves.


	In Berlin for the international premiere of the film in competition following its Grand Jury and Audience Award prizes in Sundance , Kaplan told an EFM Conference panel, thatTatum and Chan had taken producer credits on the film for entirely “worthy reasons”.

	“Gemma's involvement in this film dates back very many years. She stood by it when it was happening before and it fell apart, and she stood by it, when it was time to make the movie. She made the time and was so deeply committed to the character she played,” he said.

	“Channing was a much later addition but I heard stories from people who were involved in the film and people who weren't involved in the film that he would see people who could finance the film and say, ‘I'm trying to make this film, Josephine, and I believe in it so strongly, and I hope you'll be a part of it,” he continued. 


	“He was part of the team raising the money and trying to make the movie. And you just don't see that very often. Their commitment and their steadfastness, it's what you dream about in your actors.”

	











	Kaplan revealed the production had come together at the eleventh hour both in terms of the casting and financing, with Araújo scouting Reeves in a farmer's market just seven weeks before principal photography began, having auditioned 90 hopefuls, with the finalists including a “very established actor”.


	“Mason was only seven at the time… she turned eight on set. We had a little party… she's actually younger than on the page, but she seemed so mature for her age,” said Kaplan. 


	“Immediately, from the first time Beth started working with Mason in the casting process, she was like, ‘This is the girl. This is a choice,” he added, noting there was scepticism on the part of the producers about Reeve's suitability for the role due to her young and lack of experience.


	“If we had cast a nine-year-old, we would have been able to work that person more hours every day, so by casting someone younger our schedule had to be longer. We had to spend more money on this film just to cast Mason. Beth had to make compromises creatively to cast this girl who had never acted before… clearly it was the right choice. So, I don't know, sometimes serendipity or just believe the director who knows what she wants.”


	Kaplan said and the finance plan and project went through several iterations, with 99 percent of the people they approached turning them down.


	“I think reason number one is perceived commerciality,” he said, on the pushback. “A film like this couldn't possibly be commercial. Who wants to see something stark in stark times. We need comedy. We need levity. We need romantic comedies. We need films with Jason Statham, Gerald Butler.  you don't need a film about assault,” he said.


	“I think there's also inherent bias against films that are perhaps more geared towards women and assault survivors. So, I think there's a lack of belief in them as an audience, and a lack of desire to try to find them as an audience.”


Sumerian Pictures Deal


	Kaplan was speaking in the wake of the announcement on Saturday that Sumerian Pictures had acquired U.S. rights for the film, with the indie distributor making its biggest ever acquisition in a competitive bidding process.


	“We were lucky enough to get a few offers on the film from different companies, although interestingly… nothing worldwide, only deals for the U.S. or international, nothing across. We found ourselves an interesting situation where we were picking specifically between U.S. distributors, not world distributors,” said Kaplan.


	“We never necessarily envisioned this as a film made for streaming… we had a few offers, varying levels of financing, varying levels of theatrical commitment. Obviously, that plays some role in all of this. It was very important to Beth always, that our investors make their money back if they could. They took tremendous risk,” he said.


	“Part of the calculus, on what we decided was, of course, financial, but Sumerian, in addition to making a very meaningful financial offer, also offered a very meaningful screen commitment, a very meaningful P&A commitment,” he continued, saying the company had paid mid to high seven figures.


	“In this market, that's a huge financial commitment. That's a great outcome. That's also not just a great outcome for the investors, it's a commitment that they are making to the film as a business. They need to now go and push this film to make it work for them financially.'

	











	Giving an update on his upcoming projects, Kaplan said he was hopeful that the It Follows sequel, with David Robert Mitchell returning to direct and led by Neon, on which he is a producer, would shoot this summer. 


	In the meantime, he is in the throes of post-production on Gabriel Nussbaum's debut feature Triumph of the Will.

Almost as soon as this year's Berlinale opened, the film festival and its assembled luminaries were asked about the current political climate and their own beliefs in everything from the power of art to the scourge of fascism. Not everyone seemed entirely up for the task.

As Variety previously reported, when competition jury head Wim Wenders was asked about the power of art in fraught times, he said, “movies can change the world … [but] not in a political way.” 

He later added, when specifically asked about the conflict in Gaza (and, even more specifically, the support that Germany has shown for Israel), Wenders added that as filmmakers, “We have to stay out of politics because if we make movies that are dedicatedly political, we enter the field of politics. But we are the counterweight of politics, we are the opposite of politics. We have to do the work of people, not the work of politicians.”

The next day, celebrated Indian author and screenwriter Arundhati Roy announced that she would be pulling out of the festival, due to Wenders' and the jury's previous comments. She had been set to screen her 1989 campus comedy “In Which Annie Give It Those Ones” as part of the Classics section. 

 










“This morning, like millions of people across the world, I heard the unconscionable statements made by members of the jury of the Berlin film festival when they were asked to comment about the genocide in Gaza,” she wrote in a statement shared with Indian publication The Wire. “To hear them say that art should not be political is jaw-dropping. It is a way of shutting down a conversation about a crime against humanity even as it unfolds before us in real time – when artists, writers and film makers should be doing everything in their power to stop it.”

Elsewhere, a number of other talents were asked about politics and their own opinions during the festival's first weekend.

At a Friday press conference, Michelle Yeoh was asked about the current state of American politics, and commented, “I don't think I am in the position to really talk about the political situation in the U.S., and also I cannot presume to say I understand how it is. So, best not to talk about something I don't know about.” She added that she wanted to “concentrate on what is important for us, which is cinema.”

Later that day, Neil Patrick Harris and the team behind “Sunny Dancer” were asked during their own press conference, “Do you dare to criticize your government and do you think democracy in the U.S. is in danger?” Harris reportedly responded, ““Wow. While I have my own political opinions, I think as a performer, especially in this kind of movie, [I'm] trying to be as inclusive [as possible]. I never read this script as a political statement.” He had previously commented, “I'm always interested in doing things that are apolitical.”

 










Rupert Grint was asked to share his feelings on fascism during a press conference for “Nightborn” (“Obviously, I'm against it. But I choose my moments when to speak. But I think yeah, it's obviously hugely relevant now. You'll hear from me”).

All three actors faced almost immediate online backlash, and the fervor around the statements was enough to spark festival head Tricia Tuttle into sharing an official response, one that both proclaimed the power of free speech and art and seemed to chastise those who would ask questions about them in the festival milieu. 

The full statement from Tuttle, sent out by the festival on Saturday night, follows:

People have called for free speech at the Berlinale. Free speech is happening at the Berlinale. But increasingly, filmmakers are expected to answer any question put to them. They are criticised if they do not answer. They are criticised if they answer and we do not like what they say. They are criticised if they cannot compress complex thoughts into a brief sound bite when a microphone is placed in front of them when they thought they were speaking about something else.

It is hard to see the Berlinale and so many hundreds of filmmakers and people who work on this festival distilled into something we do not always recognise in the online and media discourse. Over the next ten days at the Berlinale, filmmakers are speaking constantly. They are speaking through their work. They are speaking about their work. They are speaking, at times, about geopolitics that may or may not be related to their films. It is a large, complex festival. A festival that people value in so many different ways and for so many reasons.
 










There are 278 films in this year's programme. They carry many perspectives. There are films about genocide, about sexual violence in war, about corruption, about patriarchal violence, about colonialism or abusive state power. There are filmmakers here who have faced violence and genocide in their lives, who may face prison, exile, and even death for the work they have made or the positions they have taken. They come to Berlin and share their work with courage. This is happening now. Are we amplifying those voices enough?There are also filmmakers who come to the Berlinale with different political aims: to ask how we can talk about art as art, and how we can keep cinemas alive so that independent films still have a place to be seen and discussed. In a media environment dominated by crisis, there is less oxygen left for serious conversation about film or culture at all, unless it can be folded as well into a news agenda.

Some films express a politics with a small “p”: they examine power in daily life, who and what is seen or unseen, included or excluded. Others engage with Politics with a capital “P”: governments, state policy, institutions of power and justice. This is a choice. Speaking to power happens in visible ways, and sometimes in quieter personal ones. Across the history of the Berlinale, many artists have made human rights central to their work. Others have made films which we see as quietly radical political acts which focus on small, fragile moments of care, beauty, love, or on people who are invisible to most of us, people who are alone. They help us make connections to our shared humanity through their movies. And in a broken world this is precious.

What links so many of these filmmakers at the Berlinale is a deep respect for human dignity. We do not believe there is a filmmaker screening in this festival who is indifferent to what is happening in this world, who does not take the rights, the lives and the immense suffering of people in Gaza and the West Bank, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in Sudan, in Iran, in Ukraine, in Minneapolis, and in a terrifying number of places, seriously.
 










Artists are free to exercise their right of free speech in whatever way they choose. Artists should not be expected to comment on all broader debates about a festival's previous or current practices over which they have no control. Nor should they be expected to speak on every political issue raised to them unless they want to.

We continue to do this work because we love cinema but we also hope and believe watching films can change things even if that is the glacial shift of changing people, one heart or mind at a time.

We thank our team, guests, juries, our filmmakers, and the many others engaged with the Berlinale for cool heads in hot times.

The search for Nancy Guthrie has taken a high-tech turn.

The Arizona police department is now flying over the Tucson, Ariz., desert with a Bluetooth signal detector, also known as a signal sniffer, in an attempt to detect a signal from Guthrie's pacemaker.

The elderly woman's pacemaker disconnected from the app on her phone just before 2 a.m. on Feb. 1, and her Nest Cam also disconnected around that time.

Several ransom notes have been sent to news organizations, including TMZ, demanding payment in bitcoin by specific deadlines.

Last week, the FBI shared frightening photos and video of a masked person approaching Nancy's home in the early morning hours of Feb. 1. 

They also released a suspect description for the alleged kidnapper, describing him as a male who's approximately 5-foot-9 or 5-foot-10, with a medium build.

The suspect tampered with a home security camera, wore a weapon on their waistband and had a bulging backpack.

At least four people have been detained for questioning, but there has been no breakthrough in the case. Delivery driver Carlos Palazuelos was detained for questioning last Tuesday, but quickly released after maintaining his innocence.

Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos confessed that the search for Nancy could take “years” but promised not to give up.

“Maybe it's an hour from now,” Nanos told the New York Times on Friday. “Maybe it's weeks or months or years from now. But we won't quit. We're going to find Nancy. We're going to find this guy.”

Savannah and her siblings have released videos on Instagram, tearfully pleading for their mother's safe return and thanking the public for their prayers and well-wishes.

The FBI also announced that they were upping a reward “for information leading to the location of Nancy Guthrie and/or the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in her disappearance” to $100,000.

February has brought heartbreak and uncertainty for Savannah Guthrie and her family. Nearly three weeks after her beloved mother, Nancy Guthrie, disappeared from her Tucson-area home, there are still more questions than answers. 

Investigators continue to pursue leads, but there has been no confirmed update on 84-year-old Nancy's whereabouts. For Savannah, the waiting has been deeply personal and painfully public. 

As the award-winning host and writer moves into her third week, she is said to be quietly reflecting on her future at “Today.”

According to NewsNation senior story editor Paula Froelich, Savannah has been weighing whether to step away from the NBC morning show she has co-hosted since 2012. She has remained off the air while the FBI and authorities in Pima County, Arizona, continue investigating Nancy's Feb. 1 disappearance.

“This absolutely came out of the blue, and I think she's really concerned that it was because of her job,” Froelich said on “NewsNation Prime” Saturday.

Froelich added that Savannah has wondered whether past segments filmed at Nancy's home may have unintentionally drawn attention.

Behind the headlines and speculation, a daughter is grappling with fear, guilt, and hope, all at once, as she waits for her mother to come home.

According to another report in Page Six, Savannah Guthrie is expected to remain off the “Today” show for the “foreseeable future.”

An NBC insider said the network and staff are standing firmly behind their longtime colleague during the ordeal. 

“The entire show and network is rallying together in support of our beloved colleague and friend as we navigate this unimaginable time,” the source shared.

While Savannah still has more than a year left on her reported $7 million annual contract, insiders have told Page Six that conversations about her professional future feel misplaced right now.

“Everyone at ‘Today' is taking this day by day, and of course giving Savannah the grace, time, and support she needs,” another source said, adding that the team continues to “all pray constantly” for a resolution.

Savannah has long invited viewers into her world, sharing pieces of her family life on air. Now, that very visibility may feel different. 

Froelich suggested that the exposure that comes with national television could be weighing heavily on her as she searches for answers.

In the future, safety for her family is expected to take priority. Savannah and her two siblings have turned to social media, posting heartfelt videos asking the public to help bring Nancy home.

In one post, Savannah wrote, “We believe she is still alive. Bring her home.”

As of now, no arrests have been made in the case.

Investigators executed a federal search warrant Friday evening at a home in Tucson and detained three individuals while following up on a lead, according to the Pima County Sheriff's Office. 

All were later released. There are no upcoming news conferences scheduled. The last formal press conference was held on February 5. Since then, Sheriff Chris Nanos has provided updates through selective media interviews.

A separate operation conducted near Nancy's residence also ended without arrests, a law enforcement official confirmed.

The FBI has shared details about a masked man captured on doorbell footage outside Nancy's home the morning she disappeared.

Federal officials say the individual is between 5 feet 9 inches and 5 feet 10 inches tall, with an average build. He was dressed in dark clothing, black gloves, and sneakers, and carried ablack 25-liter Ozark Trail Hiker Pack.

Investigators have also collected DNA evidence from inside the home that does not belong to Nancy or anyone in her immediate circle. Authorities have not disclosed where the material was located. Testing is still underway.

Several gloves have been recovered as part of the investigation, including one found miles from the residence. Those items are now being analyzed.

Springfield is celebrating its octo-centennial. 

On Sunday, “The Simpsons” is hitting a major milestone, airing a landmark 800th episode (8 p.m. on Fox). 

“There was never a point where I went to bed thinking, ‘The show is probably going to end. We're going to have to pack it up and clean all the crap out of our offices,'” showrunner Matt Selman told Page Six.

“The Simpsons” first premiered in 1989, making it the longest-running American sitcom, animated series, and primetime scripted series. 

It's set in Springfield, following the antics of the iconic cartoon family, including Homer (Dan Castellaneta) Marge (Julie Kavner), Lisa (Yeardley Smith), Bart (Nancy Cartwright) and baby Maggie. 

The 800th episode involves the family taking a trip to Philadelphia, and includes a satire of HBO Max medical drama “The Pitt” featuring Noah Wyle. 

Selman said that because the show's ratings have been steady, he never feared cancellation – and when Fox merged with Disney in 2019 and the show hit Disney+, “a whole new generation of younger fans fell in love with the show and it became their favorite show.”

Selman has been with “The Simpsons” for over twenty years since 1997, beginning as a writer before moving to exec producer in 2005 and showrunner. 

Over the years, “The Simpsons” has eerily seemed to predict future events, such as the Disney/ Fox merger or the Trump presidency. 

“It's unnerving,” said Selman. “It sort of makes you think maybe we live in a simulation, or something like that,” he joked.

“But, I always say that the more unlikely thing would be that we never predicted anything. Because I consider these to be coincidences. And if there's no coincidences, that's very unlikely.”

The showrunner noted, “although the coincidences that we did happen to predict are pretty freaky.”

Over the years, he said, “The Simpsons” hasn't hit any major roadblocks. 

“The network doesn't really weigh in that much creatively. So maybe there were little things we would have liked to push harder in terms of broadcast standards. I don't remember them,” he explained. 

He added that the team feels “lucky” that they haven't experienced, “that kind of setback creatively – of someone saying, ‘Oh, you can't do this. You can't do that.'” 

Selman acknowledged “The Simpsons” is not trying to be “South Park.” 

“We're not doing shows as in-your-face and dark and smart and funny and brilliant as that, ripped from that day's headlines. We like to do shows that are ripped from like nine months ago's headlines.”

When asked how long he sees “The Simpsons” continuing for, he said, “I think a thousand is a good number. Let's aim for a thousand. That's a good clean ending. But, I don't know, that will probably be a decision above my pay grade. But, a thousand episodes would be great.”

	Three days before Jessica Chastain's limited series The Savant was set to premiere last September, Apple TV abruptly postponed the show in the wake of the assassination of Charlie Kirk. “We appreciate your understanding and look forward to releasing the series at a future date,” the streamer said. 


	Now, nearly five months later, neither the streaming service nor any of the primary players involved in the show have offered any clarity about its fate. 


	Questions around the miniseries resurfaced after Apple held a press event earlier this month in Santa Monica announcing a slate of new shows, original films, and returning series for the upcoming year. The Savant was absent from the list.


	It's an unusual and near-unprecedented months-long delay, especially for a project backed by an A-list star in Chastain, whose production company Freckle Films spent five years developing and making the show. 


	Based on a 2019 Cosmopolitan article, the limited series follows an undercover investigator, played by Chastain, who infiltrates domestic extremist groups to thwart catastrophic large-scale attacks. Although the show isn't believed to have any direct parallels to the events surrounding conservative podcaster Kirk's death on Sept. 10, its premise revolves around online extremism, radicalized hate groups, and themes of political violence. 

	











	Apple TV did not respond to Rolling Stone's multiple requests for comment regarding the show's future, nor did it respond to questions of whether the program was being shopped around to other distributors. Representatives for Chastain also did not reply to requests for comment. 


	Last week, eagle-eyed fans spied The Savant listed as “coming soon” on Prime Video, but the title card was missing the Apple TV logo that similar cross-streamed programs have. A representative for Prime told Rolling Stone that it was not taking over the show's release, and was waiting on Apple TV to move forward with the series.

Chastain previously voiced frustration with the decision, writing on Instagram the day after the postponement that she was “not aligned on the decision to pause the release.” She noted the”unfortunate amount of violence” in the U.S. that appeared to have no effect on if a show aired — including hundreds of school shootings, the attempted kidnapping of Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, the failed assassination attempt on President Donald Trump, and the political assassination of two Minnesota Democratic representatives.

	“These incidents, though far from encompassing the full range of violence witnessed in the United States, illustrate a broader mindset that crosses the political spectrum and must be confronted,”   she wrote. “I've never shied away from difficult subjects, and while I wish this show wasn't so relevant, unfortunately it is.The Savant is about the heroes who work every day to stop violence before it happens, and honoring their courage feels more urgent than ever.” 


	Chastain ended the lengthy note with a hint of skepticism about whether the series would ever air at all. “I remain hopeful the show will reach audiences soon,” she wrote. “Until then, I'm wishing safety and strength for everyone, and I'll let you know if and when The Savant is released.”

The most uncomfortable scene in “Rosebush Pruning” doesn't involve violence or sexual perversity, although these elements are regularly entangled throughout. No, it's when Jack (Jamie Bell) brings his new girlfriend to meet his family for lunch. These things are often awkward at the best of times and with the best of families, but this oddball mess of a household might just be the actual worst.

Awkward giggles and ruthless stares punctuate silence until the blind matriarch (played by Tracy Letts) asks his daughter to describe Martha's (Elle Fanning) appearance to him in exhaustive detail. The obvious price gap between her Zara dress and the Bottega handbag gifted to her by Jack is cruelly teased out in what would usually be the turning point of a scene like this.

But then The Father takes it even further, calmly asking his daughter Anna (Riley Keough) to describe Martha's breasts. What's stranger than this request even is how it's demanded without shame (or how Anna uses this to score points in her bid to win Jack over for herself).

In turn, it would be easy to describe how the film looks with just as much appreciation for the physical aspects of it too. And yes, there's a temptation to be just as lurid as the father in doing so, because what director Karim Aïnouz achieves here visually is unreal in every sense of the word. 

Shot with devotion by DP Hélène Louvart, frame after frame looks like it's been ripped from the pages of a fashion magazine that someone like Anna might occupy herself with, eternally bored by the rich comforts that their prison-like home provides. Except there's nothing boring about the pops and splashes of color, all blood-rich reds and luminous yellows that defy the murky greys that have come to define Hollywood in recent years. Think early Pedro Almodóvar, with a far meaner streak.

The cast too are just as gorgeous to look at. From Callum Turner‘s cheekbones and Fanning's wide eyes to Keough's legs and Lukas Gage's curls, beauty strikes at every turn, yet barely conceals the barbs and thorns such looks envelop here. It's almost unnatural how good everything looks, and deliberately so. 

The opening title card, a bold contrast of that same blood-rich red and luminous yellow lingers a little longer than you might find comfortable, signaling a shift into another world that's stranger and more heightened than our own. The cast lean into this fully, often stilted with dialogue just one step out of a natural rhythm. These people are nothing like us, warped through money and transgression until they're barely recognizable as human at all.

 










That language is weaponized so maliciously throughout Aïnouz's second English-language feature speaks to his intent to unnerve the audience relentlessly. Even the film's title is lifted from a turn of phrase that Turner's younger son Ed has made up to catch people out, to feel superior and revel in their lack of understanding. Yet the bizarre behavior that accompanies each interaction is recognizable in that it bears the clear fingerprint of co-scriptwriter Efthimis Filippou. 

What story there is in “Rosebush Pruning” — loosely based on Marco Bellocchio's “Fists in the Pocket” (1965) — is characterized by a similar cadence to the one Filippou developed alongside Greek “Weird Wave” pioneer Yorgos Lanthimos in “Dogtooth” and “The Lobster.”

The fairytale-like setup further removes the film from reality. Because where else but here would a mother (played by a game Pamela Anderson) die at the hands of wild wolves, ripped apart in a forest near the family's opulent Catalonian home? Early on, we're introduced to their monthly visit to the site of her death where they leave behind a sacrificial lamb to honour The Mother's memory and ensure the wolves are well fed so no one else will die at their hands. It's not about helping people though, and it's not about Anderson's matriarch for that matter either. This is just one in a series of rituals designed to liven up the tedium of wealth, just another game in service of manipulating others while pushing back against an all-encompassing numbness.

 










The perverse vignettes come in quick succession, yet all we know for the vast majority of the film is that Jack wants out while his family all want to make out with him. It's not until toward the end that Ed begins “pruning” his rivals for Jack's attention. Even before that though, everything is pushed to increasingly shocking extremes. The twists verge on too cruel, the siblings too close, and for some people watching, the story will just be too much. 

This maximalist family saga isn't so much a rallying cry to eat the rich as it is to consume them as their desires devour each other. There are moments where this sweaty mix of comic with the dramatic threatens to almost say something of substance, but then Gage's Robert will sniff his brother's cum-stained towel or we'll finally get to see why The Father loves brushing his teeth so much and it all slips back into farce.

That's not to say the grotesquery of it all isn't entertaining, especially in the hands of this all-star cast. Keough alone could carry the film, embodying the most peculiar mix of lust and off-kilter desire in her baby-blue thigh high boots. Yet these shades of John Waters-like humur are often lost in the film's search for its own protagonist.

Jack is the most fleshed out of the siblings, leading his own separate arc opposite a typically great Elle Fanning, and it's in this narrative where the film actually threatens to say something substantial about privilege (given how Martha's wealth still pales in comparison). But that's why it's so odd when the film regularly switches Jack out for Ed's viewpoint instead. Turner plays the middle brother with intriguing melancholy and an almost alien detachment, which works within the world this film creates, but not necessarily for a main character. 

 










To center Jack instead, however, might have detracted too much from his role as an object of warped desire within the house. Either way, the result is still opaque in its messaging.

Wearying and amusing in equal measure, “Rosebush Pruning” is a visceral, often entertaining social satire without purpose. There's little direction to speak of beyond pushing us ever closer to the edge. You could argue there's certainly a demand for this, a need, even, to dismantle privilege in the end days that this world finds itself in. And when the film does dare to venture beyond shock value, the potential is staggering. 

It's just a shame that some of the freakiest moments weren't pruned in favor of something more biting, like the lunchtime trap that Martha finds herself in. After all, wolves don't just wait around for a sacrificial lamb to show up in the forest and their teeth are rarely bared in public.

“Rosebush Pruning” premiered at the 2026 Berlin Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

	The latest tranche of Epstein files released by the Justice Department has sent shockwaves through the international community. Foreign governments, royal families, businesses, universities, and cultural institutions are investigating those with ties to the notorious sex criminal, and powerful figures around the world have been forced to step down from influential positions amid revelations that they were a part of his network. The United States, however, doesn't seem to care so much.


	It should be one of the most consequential sex and crime scandals in the history of the United States, but many of those tied to Epstein are skating by with little in the way of consequence. President Donald Trump — a longtime friend of Epstein's whose name allegedly appears in the files over a million times  — and other figures working within or tied to his administration seem to not only hang above the fray, but enjoy the protection of the American justice system. 


	This week, Attorney General Pam Bondi appeared before the House Judiciary Committee, where she thrice refused to acknowledge a group of survivors sitting in the hearing room, who all affirmed that they had not been granted an opportunity to meet with the attorney general despite their requests. Bondi refused to answer questions about the Justice Department's failure to open investigations in potential coconspirators, and dismissed questions from lawmakers about the department's sloppy handling of sensitive victim information, and about the over-redaction of potentially incriminating information. 

	











	The White House also shrugged off questions about Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who — although not implicated in any criminality — was caught in a bold-faced lie about the extent of his dealings with Epstein. On Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt abruptly cut off a press briefing after being asked by a reporter if the administration would continue to stand by Lutnick. “Secretary Lutnick remains a very important member of President Trump's team, and the president fully supports the secretary,” Leavitt said. Trump has also brushed off questions about Lutnick and other figures tied to the administration appearing in the files.

	But outside of America's borders, Epstein's ghost is threatening to topple governments and prompting a wave of public and private sector resignations. 


	In the United Kingdom, the former Prince Andrew — now citizen Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor after being stripped of his titles in 2025 — was evicted from the royal “lodge” he shared with his ex-wife Sarah Furgeson, the former Duchess of York, who was also revealed to have a financial relationship with Epstein earlier this month. Mountbatten-Windsor settled a civil lawsuit in 2022 brought against him by Virginia Giuffre, who accused Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell of trafficking her to the former prince and other men when she was a teenager. 


	Now, the UK's Crown Prosecution Service is weighing an investigation into  Mountbatten-Windsor over new evidence that he may have transferred confidential government reports to Epstein while representing the kingdom as a trade envoy. 


	British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, meanwhile, is facing calls for his own resignation and a potential vote of no confidence over his relationship with Peter Mandelson, a prominent figure in the Labour Party who was tapped to serve as United States Ambassador under Starmer. Questions about the extent Starmer was aware of Mandelson's relationship with Epstein were heightened after newly released emails revealed that the two men had joked about Epstein's relationships with young women, and that Mendelson may have provided Epstein with sensitive government emails containing privileged financial information.

	Two high-level officials in Starmer's administration have resigned in the face of the scandal, Mandelson resigned from the Labour Party this month after being dismissed from his ambassadorship last year, and authorities are exploring a criminal investigation into his conduct. While Starmer insists he was misled by Mandelson about his ties to Epstein, in the view of the UK public and lawmakers, the buck stops with him. 


	Consequences are being felt in other nations, as well. Norwegian Crown Princess Mette-Marit is in hot water after emails revealed she had borrowed one of Epstein's Palm Beach properties in 2013. Norway's former Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland has also been embroiled in the scandal. On Thursday, Thorbjørn was charged with corruption by Norwegian authorities in connection to Epstein, after being stripped of his diplomatic immunity earlier this week.

	











	Jack Lang, France's former Culture Minister, resigned last week from his position as president of the prestigious Arab World Institute in Paris. In Slovakia, a national security adviser to Prime Minister Robert Fico stepped down earlier this month. A Swedish U.N. official resigned after the documents revealed a visit to Epstein's island. Several other countries — including Poland and Lithuania — have opened investigations into the potential trafficking of girls from their nations. 


	On Friday, DP World Chairman and Chief Executive Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem — who was discovered to be one of the names of potential Epstein co-conspirators whose name was redacted in files after a review by lawmakers — resigned from his position atop the Emirati international exporter. 


	Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who pushed to unredact the names of Bin Sulayem and five other individuals, wrote on X after Bin Sulayem's resignation that he and other lawmakers would “not rest until there is elite accountability for the Epstein class.”

	But in the United States, the Justice Department has staunchly refused to pursue further criminal investigations into Epstein's potential co-conspirators or participants in his trafficking ring. Resignations have been few, and powerful figures with ties to Epstein, from former President Bill Clinton  and Microsoft founder Bill Gates to Tesla billionaire Elon Musk and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon seem to have been afforded cover under Trump and his administration's repeated insistence that the scandal is a “hoax” and that Americans should turn their focus elsewhere. 


	As the international community rallies to excise the cancer of Epstein's crimes from its public institutions, Americans can only watch from afar, and lament the decay of what was once a model justice system.

Sebastian Brameshuber discusses his Panorama title, his own experience with shared rides, bringing together people in a studio for free-flowing conversations, and not shying away from emotions.


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	“The setting was very strict, because we were in the studio,” explains Sebastian Brameshuber. “But this strict set-up brought about this freedom for how the conversations could flow.”


	We are discussing London, the new film from the Austrian director of Movements of a Nearby Mountain and And There We Are, in the Middle, which will world premiere in the Panorama program of the Berlin International Film Festival. It is described as “neither a documentary nor entirely fiction.”The film features Bobby Sommer as Bobby, who is always on the road, driving up and down a highway that links the Austrian cities of Vienna and Salzburg. Via a car-sharing service, he picks up other people who are looking to travel the same route while saving money on petrol, including a young man struggling with the country's mandatory military service, a queer woman who is about to get married, a supermarket trainee, and an academic exploring the history of the highway.

	Brameshuber picked and cast people and put them in a car with Sommer in a studio to imitate the experience of long rides and allow for free-flowing conversations to develop, sometimes giving Sommer pointers, via an earpiece, about questions and topics to pursue.   


	“The most important thing for me was making this film about this particular form of encounter between strangers,” the director explains. Through this collection of interactions, the movie creates “a portrait of today's Europe,” highlights a synopsis.

	











	And audiences find out more about Bobby, his youth, his parents, his take on aging, and his friend in a coma in Salzburg, who is the reason for all his car trips.


	The reason for car sharing to be the central concept that London is built around is the fact that Brameshuber himself used this form of travel for regular trips between Vienna and Berlin in the past. “Traveling in a car with somebody who is a stranger for a long distance and spending a lot of time together produces a certain quality of conversation and a certain atmosphere that I found super interesting,” he tells THR. “You're mostly looking straight ahead, while making conversation with the person sitting next to you, so you don't look at the person, or at least only occasionally.”


	Shares Brameshuber: “The road is coming towards you, the landscape is passing by; you're efficiently moving towards a destination while just sitting there relaxed. This experience drags you into a certain atmosphere. And I ended up feeling that I would like to make a film about this.”


	Brameshuber shares how Sommer ended up in the film. He had seen him in a movie and met him in person because he needed somebody to record a poem for a short film. “I found he had a resemblance to GTO, the character Warren Oates plays in [Monte Hellman's 1971 film] Two-Lane Blacktop,” the director recalls. “And I really liked the scenes in that film where GTO is basically traveling with different passengers and reinventing his story for each passenger. So I sent Bobby the film because he hadn't seen it. And from there, the dialogue with Bobby started. But it took us basically close to 12 years for the film to come out.”


	The rest of the casting process focused on finding “young people who were engaging in conversations, willing to share a lot about their lives, but at the same time keeping a bit of a mystery,” explains Brameshuber.

	











	The A1 motorway, also known as the Westautobahn, that audiences see in the film has a complicated and dark history. “The sequence of views along this motorway was designed by the Nazis to create a picturesque route, which is very interesting to me, because it links back to my previous projects about historically charged locations,” Brameshuber tells THR. “I'm always interested in places that carry history within them, and for the Westautobahn, that's very true.”


	He adds: “Actually, it's a past that's not very visible because it's mostly under the motorway – bridges and viaducts from that period that carry parts of the Westautobahn to this day. As for the landscape views, you don't necessarily think of them as a design; you just take them as a given.”


	The working title for London was actually In Current Traffic for a very long time. That was a nod to the digital age, explains Brameshuber. “It was because Google Maps, or maybe some other navigation system at the time, had these estimates for trips: 13 hours until the destination in current traffic.”


	How did the film end up with the title London? Brameshuber says he often changes his titles when he nears finishing projects and feels what title makes sense. “The title is not supposed to be an enigma; it relates to the film in a more associative, poetic way,” he highlights. “London came up because, first of all, Bobby mentions it as the place he went to as a young man – for the music, for the spirit, for being free.” Concludes the director: “For me, the title opens up the narrow space of the car to a mental geography and to a destination that's more of a feeling.”

While 'Iron Sky' told a “story of Nazis hiding on the dark side of the Moon,” the new films “shift the battleground to Mars, where the Red Menace is alive and well.” 



		By Scott Roxborough, Patrick Brzeski 

	February 15, 2026 1:30am	




	The team behind cult sci-fi franchise Iron Sky is reuniting for another politically charged absurdist space satire — this time sending the Communists, rather than Nazis, deep into orbit.


	Producer Tero Kaukomaa and director Timo Vuorensola are raising financing for Deep Red, a planned 15 million euros ($16.2 million) sci-fi trilogy about a secret Soviet colony on Mars, conceived as a three-film saga to be shot back-to-back beginning in 2027. Releases are planned for 2029, 2030 and 2031.




	The project, which is not set within the Iron Sky universe but is designed with a similar outlandish tone, will be directed by Vuorensola, who is developing the script outlines with Finlandia Award–winning author Johanna Sinisalo, who co-wrote the original Iron Sky. Final scripts will be completed by a U.S. screenwriter.

	While Iron Sky told the “story of Nazis hiding on the dark side of the Moon,” the new films “shift the battleground to Mars, where the Red Menace is alive and well,” the producers said in a statement.

	In the world of Deep Red, “communists have secretly occupied the Red Planet since the 1950s, building a utopian society hidden from Earth.” That isolation, according to the filmmakers, has allowed them to achieve “a truly functional Communist system — made possible only by complete separation from humanity.”

	











	The trilogy opens in the present day, as an American astronaut crash-lands on Mars and discovers the hidden colony. The Martian city is governed by an oppressive Artificial Intelligence known as Deep Red, built from an old Soviet chess supercomputer. What initially appears to be a Marxist dream state soon reveals itself as a system maintained through algorithmic control and absolute surveillance.


	The producers describe the project as “a trilogy produced as one epic event,” noting that the three films will be shot simultaneously, “in the spirit of Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy.” A short film-style promotional piece is currently in development and will launch later this year.


	Financing for Deep Red follows a model that builds on the crowdfunding strategy that helped power the original Iron Sky movies. The total trilogy budget is projected at 15 million euros ($16.2 million), with 5 million euros ($5.4 million) expected from regional subsidies and tax incentives and 10 million euros ($10.8 million) to be raised through equity financing.


	That equity portion will be structured through a blockchain-based, revenue-sharing token model. The producers plan to issue up to 20 million 1-euro tokens tied to participation in the films and the broader Deep Red intellectual property.


	The tokens will be released in tranches to finance different stages of production. An initial round is seeking a minimum of 250,000 euros ($270,000) to fund a promo trailer and production buildout, with a larger tranche planned later this year targeting 10 million euros ($10.8 million) to finance the trilogy itself.In a press release, the team said the project would “once again harness the power of its global audience — this time through a next-generation, tokenized revenue-share crowdfunding model.”

	











	The new films reunite several longtime collaborators from the Iron Sky franchise. Samuli Torssonen of Energia VFX will oversee visual effects, and Slovenian art-rock band Laibach are in discussions to compose the score.


	The original Iron Sky, about Nazis hiding on the dark side of the moon, premiered in Berlin's Panorama section in 2012 and went on to spawn two sequels, fueled in part by an active online fan community and early experiments in crowd-based financing.


	Kaukomaa said the decision to shoot Deep Red as a continuous trilogy was informed by that experience. With Iron Sky, the producers were able to activate a global fan base but struggled with gaps between releases. This time, the aim is to ensure a guaranteed release schedule and sustained momentum.

"Stonewall is not just a park, it is sacred historical ground in the fight for LGBTQ+ rights," the singer wrote.


													By
												

	Mitchell Peters



Adam Lambert is speaking out against the removal of the Pride flag at Stonewall National Monument in New York City.


	In early January, the Trump administration replaced the rainbow-colored flag — a symbol of LGBTQ+ rights and inclusion — with an American flag at the National Park Service–run site in Manhattan's Greenwich Village.


	“Stonewall is not just a park, it is sacred historical ground in the fight for LGBTQ+ rights,” Lambert, a founding partner of Pride Live and the Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center (SNMVC), wrote on Instagram Thursday (Feb. 12).


	The singer continued, “The Pride flag is not a political prop; it is a symbol of visibility, resilience, and the countless lives that have fought, and continue to fight, for dignity and equality. Removing it sends a message that our history and our humanity are negotiable. They are not. We were here. We are here. And we will continue to be.”

	











	The Stonewall National Monument, located across the street from the Stonewall Inn — a historic bar known as the origin point of the LGBTQ rights movement — is a national civil rights landmark established in 2016 by President Barack Obama.




	The Pride flag was taken down on Feb. 10 under new guidance from the Trump administration. Weeks earlier, the Department of the Interior had issued federal guidance prohibiting the display of “non-agency” flags in the National Park System.


	On the same day Lambert shared his thoughts on social media, local elected officials raised the Pride flag once again at the Stonewall National Monument.


	Lambert wasn't the only artist to speak out against the Pride flag removal. Gracie Abrams also made her opinion clear by resharing comedian Benito Skinner's post about it being “Demonic” on her Instagram Story on Feb. 10.


	Recently elected NYC mayor Zohran Mamdani said in a statement on X that he was “outraged” by the seizure of the flag.


	New York is the birthplace of the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement, and no act of erasure will ever change, or silence, that history,” he wrote. “Our city has a duty not just to honor this legacy, but to live up to it.”

	The make-up and hair styling teams behind Best Picture Oscar nominees Sinners, One Battle After Another and Frankenstein swept the film categories Saturday night at the 13th annual MUAHS Awards.


	The Make-Up Artists & Hair Stylists Guild's annual ceremony honoring the best in their crafts took place at the Westin Bonaventure in Los Angeles. Rachael Harris hosted.


	Warner Bros' Sinners, which was nominated for a record 16 Oscars last month, won for both Best Period and/or Character Makeup and Hair Styling, while Warners' One Battle, up for 13 Oscars, won for both Contemporary Make-Up and Hair Styling. Netflix's Frankenstein won for Best Special Make-Up Prosthetics.

	











	Both Sinners and Frankenstein are in the running for the Makeup and Hairstyling Oscar this year, alongside Japan's Kokuho, The Smashing Machine and body horror The Ugly Stepsister.

	Last year, MUAHS voters tapped The Substance among its winners, with that Mubi pic going on to take the Oscar category. Since the modern MUAHS Awards began in 2014, one of its marquee film winners for makeup or hair has gone on the claim the Best Makeup and Hairstyling Oscar every year except twice. The last time was in 2024, when the Academy Award went to Poor Things, which was up for two of the MUAHS awards but went home empty-handed. The only other time was in 2022, when The Eyes of Tammy Faye won the Oscar but was shut out at the MUAHS.


	In the TV races tonight, NBC's Saturday Night Live led the way with three wins including one for its 50th Anniversary Special, while Apple TV's The Studio and Palm Royale won two awards apiece, each picking up individual make-up and hair styling wins.

	











	Another double winner, in the Children and Teen Programming categories, was Disney+'s Skeleton Crew.


	Tonight's ceremony also featured honorary awards bestowed by the IATSE Local 706, with Amy Madigan receiving the Distinguished Artisan Award presented by her Weapons director Zach Cregger and the pic's hair and make-up teams. Longtime Emmy-winning Nickelodeon make-up artist Michael Johnston received the Vanguard Award.


	In addition, Raging Bull and Michael Jackson's Thriller makeup artist Greg Nelson was presented the Lifetime Achievement Award for Make-Up, given by Robert Patrick and David Hussey, while Forrest Gump and The Matrix hairstylist Judy Alexander Cory received the Lifetime Achievement Award for Hair Stylists presented by Kathy Bates.


	IATSE Local 706's awards honor outstanding achievements in the artistry and creativity of makeup artists and hair stylists. Nominations for calendar year 2025 span 20 categories across film, TV, music videos and live stage productions — which include Broadway, international theater and theme parks.

"I didn't even know I was going to be in my relationship, to be honest," the Houston rapper revealed.

Megan Thee Stallion is entering what she calls her “Lover Girl” era — and she says she didn't plan it.


	In a new exclusive interview with PEOPLE, the three-time Grammy winner reflected on her relationship with Dallas Mavericks star Klay Thompson and how focusing on her own healing helped open the door to love.


	“Well, I don't never want to tell [anybody] to just jump in a relationship just because everybody else got one, and I'm not going to tell you to just jump in a relationship because you have to,” the rapper said. “I didn't even know I was going to be in my relationship, to be honest.”

	Megan and Thompson made their red carpet debut in July 2025. But she says the relationship came at a time when she was prioritizing therapy and self-growth.


	“I think that because finally I started being in a better mind space about myself and my life, and I had already been doing a lot of work to heal me,” she said. “I had been going to therapy, I had a bunch of activities that I started doing for myself; maybe God just opened up that space for me to have somebody that loved me right.”


	Now, she says, she feels a level of ease she hasn't experienced before.


	“This is one of the first times that I've ever been just overly comfortable,” Megan said with a laugh: “I'm comfy, babe!”


	Still, she cautions fans against chasing love.

	











	“People got to stop trying to be in love and trying to chase love,” she said. “They just got to let it come to them. When it's meant for you, it's going to happen. God does not give you nothing that is not meant for you.”


	The pair first sent fans into a frenzy in July 2025, when Megan posted a vacation IG photo featuring Klay Thompson in the background. 


	The Dallas Mavericks star also leaned into the rumors and soft-launched his relationship with the Houston rapper at the time, posting a photo dump of a trip to the Bahamas.

Hallmark's newest movie, “Because of Cupid,” premieres on Saturday, February 14, at 8 p.m. Eastern/7 p.m. Central. The movie stars Amy Groening and Evan Roderick. Read on to learn all about where the movie was filmed and see behind-the-scenes cast stories. 

“Because of Cupid” was filmed in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, according to IMDb. Roderick also revealed in an interview that they filmed in Ontario.

Groening shared a post with behind-the-scenes moments on Instagram. 

Director Liz Farrer shared her own set of behind-the-scenes pictures. 

Producer Kevin Duda wrote a long post on Instagram in honor of the movie. 

He wrote, in part: “…Once-in-a-while, I get to see a movie to the finish line that came from my brain (usually after a glass of wine.) For these, I get to work with incredible development execs at the network, passionate writers and then see the movie through from prep to post. That is the story of BECAUSE OF CUPID, which airs this Saturday, February 14th at 8pm on Hallmark Channel. From dreaming up this story, building on it with Amy Meyerson, having the wonderful Elise Speiser see its potential, collaborating with Sarah Montana's clever wit, teaming up with the OG Ashley Squires, Larry Grimaldi and the Neshama family & crew (Vinuja, Jordana, Vanessa, Mitch & more), to working with my fave Liz Farrer and a cast of dreams including Evan Roderick, Amy Groening, Adam Tsekhman, Tenille Read, Darryl Hinds, Ric Waugh, Sarah Booth, JT Silver. It's more than I could ask. I hope you all love this movie as much as I do. And that you all believe a little magic can happen when you follow your heart.”

Tennille Read shared some behind-the-scenes moments as well. 

And here are some photos from Darryl Hinds: 

Adam Tsekhman shared a video of “the Cupid shuffle.” 

Hallmark's synopsis for this movie reads: “Best friends Naomi and Marcus participate in a Valentine's Day mocktail competition but things go awry when Cupid interferes with a love potion that affects Marcus and several of their friends.” 

Amy Groening is Naomi. Her notable roles include works like “Horizon” on NBC, “Reign” where she has a recurring role, “Backpackers” on the CW, “Bone Cage,” and more. For Hallmark, her credits include films like “The Santa Summit,” “‘Twas the Date Before Christmas,” and more.

Evan Roderick is Marcus. Roderick has numerous film and TV credits to his name, such as “When We Rise,” on ABC, “Project MC2” on Netflix, “Arrow” on the CW, “Secrets of a Marine's Wife,” “Spinning Out,” and more. For Hallmark, he's known for movies like “A Tale of Two Christmases,” “Autumn in the City,” “Aurora Teagarden” films, “Leah's Perfect Gift,” “Sealed with a List,” and more. 

Also starring, according to IMDb, are Jonathan Maxwell Silver (Steven) and Sandra Flores (Lucy).

"Fortunately, his Television Ratings are so low that nobody will learn about his various Fake News statements about me," the president wrote on Truth Social Saturday. 


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



Donald Trump is firing back against Bill Maher, seemingly after he shared some critics of the president on Friday's episode of Real Time. 


	Trump took to Truth Social Saturday to claim that he wasted time having dinner with the television host at the end of March 2025. He specifically referenced a moment during Maher's most recent show where he slammed the president for his Monday post where he argued that China will “terminate ALL Ice Hockey being played in Canada.”




	“Sometimes in life you waste time! T.V. Host Bill Maher asked to have dinner with me through one of his friends, also a friend of mine, and I agreed. He came into the famed Oval Office much different than I thought he would be,” Trump began in his new post. “He was extremely nervous, had ZERO confidence in himself and, to soothe his nerves, immediately, within seconds, asked for a ‘Vodka Tonic.' He said to me, ‘I've never felt like this before, I'm actually scared.' In one respect, it was somewhat endearing!”

	He continued, “Anyway, we had a great dinner, it was quick, easy, and he seemed to be a nice guy and, for his first show after our dinner, he was very respectful about our meeting — But with everything I have done in bringing our Country back from ‘OBLIVION,' why wouldn't he be?”


	The president critiqued Maher's Real Time for “devolv[ing] into the same old story — Very boring, ANTI TRUMP,” continuing to reference comments made by the host about his earlier comments about China terminating ice hockey in Canada during the Feb. 13 broadcast. 

	











	“I jokingly stated in a TRUTH that, ‘The first thing China will do is terminate ALL Ice Hockey being played in Canada, and permanently eliminate The Stanley Cup.' Well, he went on and on about the Hockey statement, like ‘What kind of a person would say such a foolish thing as this,' as though I were being serious when I said it,” Trump wrote, continuing by comparing him to fellow late night hosts Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Fallon and Stephen Colbert, all of whom he's been vocally critical of. 


	Trump wrote, “Fortunately, his Television Ratings are so low that nobody will learn about his various Fake News statements about me. He is no different than Kimmel, Fallon, or Colbert but, I must admit, slightly more talented!”


	Maher recounted his meeting with the president last year during the April 11 episode of Real Time, where he noted that Trump was “gracious and measured,” and not like the “person who plays a crazy person on TV.”


	“The guy I met is not the person who the night before the dinner shit tweeted a bunch of nasty crap about how he thought this was a bad idea and what a deranged asshole I was,” Maher continued during his monologue. “I read it and thought, ‘Oh, what a lovely way to welcome someone to your house.' But when I got there, that guy wasn't living there.”


	The visit was much-discussed at the time, with some critiquing the Club Random podcast host's shifting perspective on Trump. 


	“You can hate me for it, but I'm not a liar,” Maher added. “Trump was gracious and measured and why he isn't that in other settings, I don't know and I can't answer, and it's not my place to answer. I'm just telling you what I saw and I wasn't high.”

	











	At the end of Trump's latest Truth Social post about Maher, he concluded, “Maher asked me if he could come back to the White House again and, with his friend, also asked to come to the wonderful White House Christmas Party, but he didn't. Regardless, I'd much rather spend my time MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN than wasting it on him. Bill continues to suffer from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome (TDS!), and there is nothing that will ever be done to cure him of this very serious disease.”

Rihanna suffered a wardrobe malfunction while attending her boyfriend A$AP Rocky's AWGE fashion show. 

The “Diamonds” songstress, 37, stole the show as cameras caught her flashing her derrière while walking inside the Hall des Lumieres on Friday night.

As she stepped inside the venue, her black leather AWGE coat featured a slit that climbed up the back, revealing her backside. 

She quickly readjusted the back of her coat so her legs were covered from the flash of the cameras. 

The Savage Fenty founder wore a black lace bra and a pair of sheer black footless tights under the jacket, which was adorned with a fur trim. She finished off her look with some classic black stiletto heels. 

For accessories, she wore flashy silver jewelry for the outing. She styled her hair pulled back into a slicked ponytail.

Once inside the show, she took several lighthearted photos, holding the program notes in front of her eyes. 

She took up a space next to Rocky's cousin, A$AP Nast, the rapper and influencer from Harlem. After the show, the singer couldn't help but gush about her man, 37, with whom she shares three children: RZA, Riot, and Rocki.  

“I'm always proud of my man,” Rihanna told Alexa after the runway extravaganza. “My guy's creative and a genius.”

The “Praise the Lord” rapper launched his fashion brand — pronounced “Og” — in 2024. He released his first two collections at Paris Fashion Week. 

“The first rule of AWGE is we never reveal what AWGE is,” he said of the brand's meaning on “The Ebro Show” in January. “And the second rule is when in doubt, revert to rule #1.

“It's just a creative conglomerate: record label, clothing fashion brand, creative incubator, publishing company, creative direction company,” continued the rapper and producer. “We literally do creative direction for other artists. Creativity is what drives it and creativity is first.”

Tut Nyuot plays a new inmate at a Northeast England detention center for young offenders in 'Adolescence' actor Ashley Walters' directing debut.


							By 

	David Rooney


Chief Film Critic


	It's not easy trying to reinvent the prison movie given the regularity with which most of the world's major film industries grind them out. But every so often, one comes along that adheres to the basic template of the genre while shrugging off the formulaic elements, electrifying it with probing psychology, unpredictable character dynamics and unexpected intimacy — alongside the shocking violence. David McKenzie's explosive Starred Up is a relatively recent example that comes to mind.


	Actor-turned director Ashley Walters' impressive feature debut Animol can't match that 2013 drama's Shakespearean muscularity. But it has power, ferocity, almost unbearable tension and a vein of tenderness that make it belong in the same conversation. It also shares a queer thread with Starred Up that's best not detailed here, beyond saying that it's gratifyingly surprising, handled with empathy and shaded in gray rather than black and white. An impressive young principal cast of mostly unfamiliar faces is another plus.

The Bottom Line

	
	Terrifying and touching in equal measure.
	



Venue: Berlin Film Festival (Perspectives)Cast: Tut Nyuot, Vladyslav Baliuk, Sekou Diaby, Ryan Dean, Sharon Duncan-Brewster, Stephen GrahamDirector: Ashley WaltersScreenwriter: Nick Love

								1 hour 33 minutes			






	Walters and screenwriter Nick Love establish their savvy grasp of narrative economy within the opening scene. Over a black screen, a scuffle is heard, indicating what appears to be a robbery that goes badly wrong for the crew, which leads to an impulsive and much more serious crime.


	Troy (Tut Nyuot) arrives at a detention center for young offenders in Northeast England, with a face that could mean stony silence or deer-in-the-headlights terror. He's a tall, solidly built guy but he has the unsure air of a boy, something he will have to lose fast. Placed in a holding cell before being processed, he starts a timid conversation with Krystiyan (Vladyslav Baliuk), a spindly Polish kid who seems grateful for the overture.

	











	But the mood shifts abruptly when Dion (Sekou Diaby) swaggers in, making it known that he's very much at home there and wasting little time before deciding which of the newbies is going to be his bitch. Troy gets the unwanted honor, which comes with a degrading task that puts him at risk of being branded as trouble even before he gets into the uniform. In a split-second decision during which instinct triggers instant loyalty, Krys creates a distraction that allows Troy's reluctant transgression to go undetected, putting him in Dion's good books, at least for now.


	Any illusions that an incarceration facility for young offenders will be much different from a high security adult prison are quickly dispelled. The noise alone, the constant yelling and fighting and clanging of metal, communicate that this is an ugly cauldron of undiluted testosterone and hostility, ready to boil over at any time.


	Troy's introduction to the place is made more unsettling by the cellmate with whom he finds himself, Mason (Ryan Dean), a menacing-looking Shia LaBeouf type with lots of face tatts. Mason gives him a somewhat civilized welcome but has too much bristling nervous energy to be trusted. Sure enough, he randomly picks a fight in the dining hall with Krys, threatening the guards with a shiv when they break it up. That brings Educational Welfare Officer Claypole (the always fantastic Stephen Graham, who appeared with Walters in Adolescence) to defuse the situation.


	Claypole is quick to notice when Troy starts doing jobs for Dion, and sharp enough to realize that the new prisoner is doing nothing of his own volition. From Troy's files, Claypole learns he was in a children's home and informs him that his estranged mother, Joy (Sharon Duncan Brewster), has requested visiting rights.

	











	She's a former junkie, who made serious mistakes when Troy was growing up, so despite assurances that she's been clean for a year, he wants nothing to do with her. But she persists, leading to some poignant scenes that never take the standard turns. Joy is also a welcome vibrant light from the outside world, with her cool tattoos and piercings, her elaborate swirl of braids and sexy, blingy outfits.


	The first visit goes south and Troy is so upset he loses his cool in the rec room, messing up Mason with a broken pool cue during another incident with Krys. Once he gets out of isolation, he has two dangerous thugs to watch out for — Mason, who clearly will be looking for payback, and crafty manipulator Dion, who continues finding ways to keep Troy under his thumb.


	He assigns Troy to pick up drone drops of drugs in the prison yard, which he manages to pull off with Krys' help as a decoy, again creating a distraction. Despite Dion's superstitious prejudices about “gypsy” curses, Troy convinces him to make Krys part of the crew. They both start spending time in Dion's cell, which is like a corner-office suite — part drug den, part fight club. Guards are presumably being bought off to turn a blind eye.


	Endeavoring to make him into a killer, Dion gives Troy a razor to use on Mason. But his big brother attitude only goes so far, leading to a distressing situation in which Troy and Krys' friendship is exploited against them for the amusement of Dion's posse of bros. Even more horrifying is the ordeal they later put Krys through after Troy is bluntly dismissed.

	











	Love's script is laser-focused on the volatility of incarcerated life and the many ways it can corrupt or break people as bullies reinforce their power by taking ownership of weaker, less seasoned inmates. Being taken under the wing of a thug with muscle and clout behind him can give momentary assurance. But any protection can evaporate as they just as easily fall out of favor on a whim, based on nothing more than the urge to hurt and humiliate.


	One of the more saddening aspects of Animol (a misspelled word seen carved into a cell wall in solitary) is the change in Troy's gaze — from alert and observant to constantly on edge, his eyes almost involuntarily darting in every direction at once to spot a threat. Nyuot (excellent as a reform school troublemaker in Netflix's Steve, with Cillian Murphy, and also seen recently in The Long Walk) digs deep in an affecting performance, largely internalized but every now and then unable to contain his changeable emotions.


	The actor is a superb vessel for the director's exploration of the identity struggle of outsiders with few if any guiding models of Black manhood and masculinity, let alone sexuality.


	Nyuot is also well-paired with the terrific Baliuk as Krys, whose inextinguishable humor and lightness suggest that a tough life riddled with unfairness and aggression is nothing new to him. Walters and Love clearly share a strong belief in the comforts of human contact in an inhuman environment. The strengthening of Troy and Krys' bond is heartening to see, even if it inevitably turns heartrending when their connection is exploited against them for Mason's gain.

	











	There are a few questionable choices, like Troy's nightmare, which veers visually toward overwrought Ryan Murphy cliché. And I'm not sure I entirely bought Claypole's shame workshop as a cathartic moment, even if Graham imbues the character with enough warmth, calm, patience and gentle authority to sell anything. The EWO seems to be a proxy for the writer and director, whose care and compassion for their characters is never in doubt.


	Overall, this is a very confident debut with solid storytelling and character-defining instincts, expertly modulated dread punctuated by jolts of gasp-inducing violence and a striking visual command. DP Tasha Back shoots the drab institutional setting with surprising cinematic vitality, softening the usual sickly greens and claustrophobic spaces with warming lighting and emotionally attuned reds. The frequent use of tight close-ups is beautiful.


	This is a modest but trenchant drama and an ideal choice for Berlin's relatively new first feature competition, Perspectives. It's grim and wrapped in despair much of the time but willing to make space for hope, understanding and forgiveness. Most of all it's never banal, always involving, with fully convincing performances across the board. If Walters decides to make the switch to behind the camera a permanent career change, he appears to have the goods.

Hallmark star Jen Lilley has an extra special reason to celebrate this Valentine's Day, and it's all because of her husband, Jason Wayne.

The couple got engaged on Valentine's Day, and this year marks a significant anniversary for the couple.

Lilley used social media to share that 20 years ago, on Valentine's Day, Wayne proposed to her.

“We got engaged 20 years ago today. (Scroll to the end pics to see proof🤣💕) Valentines is actually my favorite holiday. And not because of the romance, I never had a Valentine until Jason (my best one!) but because it was the one day in school the bullies had to give their victims candy and it felt like everyone got along,” she began her caption.

The “Days of Our Lives” alum explained that, despite the cliché of the day, Wayne chose Valentine's Day to pop the question. Their proposal day even included a dinner at a restaurant where Lilley's parents had their first date, and where she vowed to only eat with the man she would spend the rest of her life with.

Lilley recounted how they took a walk in the freezing cold Virginia winter, which ended with Wayne squatting instead of getting down on one knee because of the mud, and asking her to be his wife.

“The ring box had a light up feature and I have no idea what he said after the first sentence, but the legend goes, I didn't even say yes. I just laughed and kissed him and put the ring on. 🤣 then we used the ring box as a flashlight to get back to my dorm. The food at the Schnitzel House wasn't our fave, but it was the most perfect night. I mean I got engaged and then had dinner where my parents had their first date🥹💕,” the actress wrote.

Fast forward two decades, and Lilley couldn't be happier with the life she and Wayne have built. They have been through the good, the bad, and the ugly together, and Lilley wouldn't have it any other way.

“Cheers to my forever Valentine, @jasonthewayne,” Lilley ended her message.

The couple is living their best life with their four children. Wayne and Lilley are huge advocates for foster care and adoption. They began fostering in 2016 through Childhelp, which led to their adoption of their two sons.

In 2019, Lilley and Wayne adopted their oldest son, Kayden. One year later, in 2020, the couple adopted Kayden's biological younger brother, Jeffrey.

The parents also have two biological daughters, Julie, born in 2019, and Jackie, born in 2022.

	Prolific writer-producer David E. Kelley jokingly said he would “never” work with three-time Oscar-nominated Michelle Pfeiffer, also his wife of over three decades; that is, until casting for his latest project, Apple TV‘s adaptation of Margo's Got Money Troubles.


	The 11-time Emmy winner partook in the streamer's press day earlier this month, which also featured top series like Pluribus, The Last Thing He Told Me and others. During a panel conversation alongside stars Elle Fanning, Nick Offerman, Thaddea Graham and Pfeiffer, Kelley discussed the casting process with author and moderator Rufi Thorpe.

	He said, “[The book] made the casting process so easy, because everyone fell in love with it. I think when you and I first talked, Nick, you had read the book, and that was it. You were in without knowing what we were gonna do to it. Elle owned Margo, I think, before I even picked up a pen. And the actress there in the middle, who I vowed never to work with…”

	“I'm very difficult,” Pfeiffer interjected wryly.


	Kelley continued, referencing their longtime marriage, “When I read the book, I could only see one person playing it, and we're lucky enough that she said yes, the second luckiest yes I've gotten from her.”


	Elsewhere, Pfeiffer praised the collaborative and tight-knit environment the cast built. “I don't ever feel like you work on developing a rapport. You either have it, or you don't,” she explained, adding later, “But even from the first table read, when we just sat in a room around a table and we didn't know each other, and Nick was sitting next to me and I was completely starstruck and very nervous, and, you know, just the mega talent in the room, from Rufi to Mr. Kelley over here, and this cast, this extraordinary cast. So, honestly, we just had fun every day, and every day was discovery.”


	Due on the streamer April 15, the comedy-drama — won by Apple in a competitive bidding war — follows a recent college dropout and aspiring writer, Margo (Fanning), the daughter of an ex-Hooters waitress (Pfeiffer) and ex-pro wrestler (Offerman), as she's forced to adapt to new motherhood and mounting debt.

	











	Nicole Kidman, Greg Kinnear, Marcia Gay Harden, Michael Angarano, Rico Nasty and Lindsey Normington also star.

One of the most peculiar accounts of a UFO encounter comes from the former Soviet Union, involving an incident where dozens of soldiers were reportedly turned to stone by extraterrestrial beings.

According to a report from that time, in 1993, troops shot down an alien spacecraft flying over Siberia using a surface-to-air missile. Five beings allegedly emerged from the wreckage and transformed into a glowing orb that emitted a beam of light, instantly petrifying 23 soldiers, leaving only a few survivors to tell the tale.

This strange story made its way into a Ukrainian newspaper and was even mentioned in a declassified CIA file, which suggested that if true, it would indicate the existence of highly advanced alien technology posing a significant threat when provoked. It comes after Stephen Hawking predicted the exact date of the apocalypse, with NASA issuing a warning.

Despite public dismissal by the then USSR, claiming reports of UFO sightings and alien encounters were simply Western fabrications, newly released documents reveal that the Soviets were quietly documenting and analyzing unusual aerial phenomena, reports the Express.

Throughout the 70s and 80s, institutions regularly recorded what they termed 'Abnormal Atmospheric Phenomena'.

One of the most striking entries is dated February 13, 1989, and describes a large aerial object over Nalchik, in southern Russia. Witnesses reported a 'jellyfish'-like shape that they claimed hovered in the sky for over an hour before vanishing from view.

Although not included in the files, the most infamous case involved a low-flying, saucer-shaped craft appearing above a Soviet military unit during training exercises in Siberia.

After shooting down the craft with a missile, five figures reportedly emerged from the wreckage before merging into a single "spherical object" that "began to buzz and hiss sharply", grew in size and exploded, emitting a flash of light that instantly turned 23 nearby soldiers into stone pillars. It's alleged that two survivors lived because they were less exposed.

Claims suggest that the remains of the UFO and the petrified troops were transported to a secret scientific research institution near Moscow, where it was determined that the men had been transformed into a substance identical to limestone.

While the CIA did take note of the Ukrainian report, which referenced KGB leaks, the file is merely a reprint of the 1993 Ukrainian article and does not form part of an investigative report validating its contents.

It comes as Barack Obama confessed aliens are real before lifting the lid on Area 51.

Former President Barack Obama speaks at the Obama Foundation Democracy Forum, Dec. 5, 2024, in Chicago.

Editor

Former President Barack Obama said in an interview published Saturday that aliens are “real,” but added that he hadn't seen them. 

Asked by progressive podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen about the existence of extraterrestrial life, the former president responded: “They're real.”

“But I haven't seen them. They're not being kept at Area 51. There's no underground facility—unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the President of the United States.”

The interviewer did not ask a follow-up question on the topic.

The former president also spoke out about the recent deployment of thousands of immigration agents to Minnesota, condemning what he described as “rogue behavior” of the federal government during the months-long enforcement surge. 

Obama compared the actions of the Trump Administration in Minnesota to behavior that “we've seen in authoritarian countries and we've seen in dictatorships, but we have not seen in America.”

“It is important for us to recognize the unprecedented nature of what ICE was doing in Minneapolis, St. Paul, the way that federal agents, ICE agents were being deployed, without any clear guidelines, training, pulling people out of their homes, using five-year-olds to try to bait their parents,” he said, referring to the case of 5-Year-Old Liam Conejo Ramos.

“So the rogue behavior of agents of the federal government is deeply concerning and dangerous, but we should take a moment to appreciate the extraordinary outpouring of organizing, community building, decency, neighbors buying groceries for folks, accompanying children to school, teachers who were standing up for their kids, not just randomly, but in a systematic, organized way, citizens saying, “this is not the America we believe in,'” he said. 

Obama, whom Trump succeeded in 2017, had previously spoken out against the federal immigration operations in Minneapolis following the killings of Alex Pretti and Renee Good by federal agents. 

In a statement with his wife Michelle posted on X after Pretti's death, Obama claimed that Trump and officials in his Administration “seem eager to escalate the situation” instead of “trying to impose some semblance of discipline and accountability over the agents they've deployed.”

“This has to stop,” Obama said. “I would hope that after this most recent tragedy, Administration officials will reconsider their approach.” 

The Trump Administration said Thursday it is winding down its massive immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota following months of unrest over excessive use of force by immigration officers in the state, including the shooting deaths of Pretti and Good.

“I have proposed and President Trump has concurred that this surge operation conclude,” border czar Tom Homan told reporters in a press conference in Minneapolis on Thursday.

President Donald Trump sent Homan, his top immigration advisor, to Minnesota late last month to address large-scale protests over excessive use of force by immigration officers in the state. Homan took over leadership of “Operation Metro Surge” from Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino and quickly set up meetings with local and state leaders, including sheriffs, police chiefs, Governor Tim Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison.

Obama also responded indirectly to the recent controversy over a video posted by President Donald Trump that depicted him and First Lady Michelle Obama as apes. 

When asked about it, Obama commented on how there is a "sort of clown show that's happening in social media and on television.” 

"What is true is there doesn't seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sense of decorum and a sense of propriety and respect for the office. So that's been lost," he added. 

Trump has refused to apologize for posting the video, saying he instructed a staffer to share it but that he had not seen the offending part.

"I didn't see the whole thing," Trump said. "I looked at the first part, and it was really about voter fraud in the machines, how crooked it is, how disgusting it is. Then I gave it to the people. Generally, they look at the whole thing. But I guess somebody didn't."

Unidentified flying objects (UFOs) have been spotted over restricted US nuclear facilities, with information so classified that even presidents are briefed only on a need-to-know basis, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a close ally of former President Donald Trump.

Rubio made the striking revelation in a trailer for The Age of Disclosure, a UFO documentary released on November 21, 2025, with streaming on Prime Video and awards-qualifying theatrical screenings. Produced by Emmy-winning director Dan Farah, the film claims an 80-year global cover-up of non-human intelligence.

In the clip, Rubio says: "There had been reports of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities" that wasn't American-made. He adds that the intelligence "keeps me up at night," and whistleblowers are putting their lives on the line by coming forward.

These assertions build on a lengthy history of UFO encounters connected to nuclear sites, stretching back to the beginning of the atomic era. During World War II, Allied pilots reported "foo fighters" - enigmatic glowing spheres that followed aircraft over Europe and the Pacific, resisting conventional explanations and sparking early theories of advanced surveillance technology.

The 1947 Roswell incident, in which an alleged "flying disc" crashed near a New Mexico Army Air Field, sparked modern conspiracy theories: the military initially announced a "flying saucer" recovery before retracting the statement, calling it a weather balloon. Theorists, ranging from authors like Stanton Friedman to online forums, have long claimed a government-orchestrated cover-up of alien craft and bodies, with Roswell serving as the epicenter for decades of skepticism toward official denials.

Mr Rubio's revelation also brings to mind a notorious 1967 incident at Montana's Malmstrom Air Force Base, where UFOs allegedly disabled US nuclear missiles. Then-Captain Robert Salas, who was overseeing an underground silo, received a report of a glowing disc hovering overhead.

Moments later, all 10 Minuteman missiles inexplicably shut down, despite multiple safeguards. Robert Salas, who later spoke publicly about the incident, described it as beyond human technology - possibly an extraterrestrial message against nuclear weapons.

DON'T MISS…

The film features declassified Pentagon videos from 2004 and 2015, showing Navy pilots reacting to objects moving at seemingly impossible speeds. One Navy pilot states: "There's a whole fleet of them... My gosh, they're all going against the wind."

The Defense Department confirmed the authenticity of the footage this week but described the phenomena as "unidentified," unconnected to US programs.

This corresponds with official concerns: A 2019 Pentagon task force documented "unauthorised and/or unidentified aircraft" in military zones, leading to streamlined Navy reporting procedures. The now-defunct Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, headed by Luis Elizondo until his 2017 resignation over secrecy issues, investigated similar incursions.

Luis Elizondo told CNN: "There is very compelling evidence that we may not be alone."

As a former member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr. Rubio demands attention. He states: "It's a crucial topic," highlighting possible threats from sophisticated - or extraterrestrial - origins.

With The Age of Disclosure showcasing senior officials, the controversy surrounding airspace over America's nuclear facilities grows.

The evidence suggests various scenarios, from hostile nations to unmanned aircraft or cutting-edge technology. What was once classified information now requires careful examination.

Did former President Barack Obama finally answer one of the world's biggest mysteries?

During an appearance Saturday on Brian Tyler Cohen's podcast, the former commander in chief was asked directly if aliens were real.

“They're real, but I haven't seen them,” Obama answered.

The 44th president also said aliens were not being kept at the Nevada Air Force base known as Area 51.

“There's no underground facility, unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States,” Obama continued.

Cohen then asked what Obama's first question was after becoming president — and it again involved aliens.

“Uh, where are the aliens?” he joked.

Saturday's interview was not the first time Obama talked about the possible existence of extraterrestrial life.

During a 2021 appearance on “The Late Late Show with James Corden,” Obama said that after taking office, he sought information on aliens and whether they were being studied in a secret lab. He was told the answer was “no.”

But Obama did note that officials are seriously investigating aircraft that behave in seemingly unexplainable ways.

“There is footage and records of objects in the skies that we don't know exactly what they are,” he said. “We can't explain how they moved, their trajectory. They did not have an easily explainable pattern. I think people still take seriously trying to investigate and figure out what that is.”

Fox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy later asked President Joe Biden about Obama's comments, referring to unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP).

“What do you think that it is?”

Biden replied, “I would ask (Obama) again.”

UAPs have gained attention in recent years, including from the federal government.

Congress passed the Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Disclosure Act in 2023 and the Department of War has also created the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office.

Former US President Barack Obama sparked interest in extraterrestrial life by claiming that aliens are "real". But he also said that he doesn't know where they are. During an interview released Saturday, Obama responded to YouTuber Brian Tyler Cowen's question about the existence of aliens.

Obama said the aliens are real, but quickly dismissed conspiracy theories that they are being kept at Area 51, a secretive US Air Force base in Nevada.

"They're real," he said, further adding, "...but I haven't seen them, and they're not being kept in, Area 51."

"There's no underground facility, unless there's this enormous conspiracy, and they hid it from the president of the United States."

Area 51 has long been associated with alien and unverified UFO sightings. However, the US government didn't officially acknowledge the base's existence until 2013. It's said to be a testing ground for advanced military aircraft.

Obama's comments come amid growing interest in Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), the government's term for UFOs. The Pentagon has established the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) to investigate UAP sightings, and Congress has passed laws requiring the government to disclose more information about these incidents.

There is no concrete evidence that can confirm the existence of life beyond planet Earth. Still, scientists keep scanning the vast reaches of outer space in the hope of finding a clue. However, scientists recently received a breakthrough because of a crowd-sourced project aimed at searching for alien intelligence.

The project named, the SETI@Home was launched in 1999, and millions of volunteers worldwide participated, aiming to identify unusual radio signals in data from the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.

The huge radio telescope collapsed in 2020 due to a cable failure, and the project ended abruptly, but citizen scientists have identified more than 12 billion signals of interest in 21 years of data.

Researchers are now checking and analysing the results, as after 21 years, the team narrowed down the signals to 100 promising candidates, currently being re-examined using China's FAST radio telescope.

There is no concrete evidence that can confirm the existence of life beyond planet Earth. Still, scientists keep scanning the vast reaches of outer space in the hope of finding a clue. However, scientists recently received a breakthrough because of a crowd-sourced project aimed at searching for alien intelligence.

The project named, the SETI@Home was launched in 1999, and millions of volunteers worldwide participated, aiming to identify unusual radio signals in data from the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.

The huge radio telescope collapsed in 2020 due to a cable failure, and the project ended abruptly, but citizen scientists have identified more than 12 billion signals of interest in 21 years of data.

Researchers are now checking and analysing the results, as after 21 years, the team narrowed down the signals to 100 promising candidates, currently being re-examined using China's FAST radio telescope.

Khan persuaded victims to meet him at isolated spots, where he would rape or sexually abuse them, saying he would be possessed or disguised as a jinn, or supernatural spirit.

Saturday 14 February 2026 20:42, UK

A former imam who coerced his victims, some as young as 12, into believing he had supernatural powers, has been found guilty of 21 sexual offences, including nine counts of rape.

Abdul Halim Khan, 54, of Old Ford Road, Bethnal Green, in east London, used his position as a respected faith leader to abuse multiple women and girls between 2004 and 2015, the Metropolitan Police said.

He was convicted of nine counts of rape, four counts of sexual assault, two counts of sexual assault of a child under 13, five counts of rape of a child under 13 and one count of assault by penetration at Snaresbrook Crown Court on Friday.

Khan persuaded victims to meet him at isolated spots, including flats and quiet, hidden locations, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said.

He would then rape or sexually abuse them, saying he would be possessed or disguised as a jinn, or supernatural spirit, the CPS added.

Victims felt they had to keep these acts hidden and quiet from families and friends, or they may be harmed by "black magic", the CPS said.

His offending came to police attention in 2018 when the youngest victim reported him to a teacher at her school, the force said.

When questioned, Khan repeatedly denied the allegations, calling them a conspiracy and saying the victims had made them up for revenge, police said.

Khan was eventually charged in March 2023.

A survivor of his abuse, speaking after the verdict, said what she suffered as a child "has had a profound and lasting impact".

She said she still carried the trauma with her, having "lived with shame, fear and confusion that were not mine to carry. The loss of trust, in people, in systems, and at times in myself, shaped much of my adult life.

"I hope this outcome acknowledges not only the abuse itself, but the deep and lasting harm it causes.

Detective Sergeant Sara Yems, who led the investigation, said the seven women who came forward showed "extraordinary courage", adding she hoped that Khan's conviction would "offer a small measure of comfort".

Melissa Garner, specialist prosecutor for the CPS, said Khan "abused his position of trust and authority to carry out a vicious series of rapes and sexual abuses against seven victims, including three vulnerable teenage girls."

She added: "Khan coerced and deceived them into thinking that he possessed supernatural powers which could protect them and their families from harm in exchange for hideous acts of sexual abuse without their consent".

Khan will be sentenced next month.

The truth is out there. 

Former President Barack Obama said that aliens are real but he has no idea where they are during a podcast appearance released Saturday.

“They're real, but I haven't seen them,” Obama told YouTuber Brian Tyler Cowen after he asked him about extraterrestrials.

The former president did not offer any further details on what he mean by “real” — and no follow-up questions on the topic were asked — but he used the appearance to cast doubt on several longtime theories as to where they might be.

“They're not being kept in Area 51, there's no underground facility, unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States,” Obama said.

Area 51 refers to a highly secretive Air Force base in Groom Lake, Nevada. It has long been the subject of fascination for conspiracy theorists who believe the government is hiding alien aircraft and bodies on the premises.

Interest in potential alien contact with Earth has spiked in recent years after a series of government documents revealed several mysterious aircraft sightings. 

Leaked radar footage taken by United States Airforce reaper drones 13 years ago purported to show Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), the government's new term for UFOs, flying in the Middle East. 

The footage was shared by reporters and prominent UFO researchers George Knapp and Jeremy Corbell in early February.

The Pentagon released three unclassified Navy videos in 2021 that showed bizarre objects tearing through the sky as US servicemen reacted with awe, one UAP was seen rotating against the wind.

This is not the first time Obama has commented on the existence of little green men and UFOs.

“When it comes to aliens, there are some things I just can't tell you on air,” he teased  to “The Late Late Show” host James Corden in a 2021 interview.

The 44th Commander in Chief went on to confirm that the UAP sightings were legitimate, and that the government could not explain the aircrafts' origin or their unusual flight patterns. 

“But what is true — and I'm actually being serious here — is that there's footage and records of objects in the skies that we don't know exactly what they are,” he said. 

With additional reporting from Shane Galvin.
