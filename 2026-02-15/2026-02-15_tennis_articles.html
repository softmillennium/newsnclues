                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Persistence eventually paid off for Alex de Minaur at the ABN AMRO Open on Sunday. De Minaur fell in the past two Rotterdam finals, but he was crisp and clinical in all departments against Auger-Aliassime, who required an off-court medical timeout midway through the second set. “That's what it's all about: just doing my best to rise to the occasion,” De Minaur said of his final performance, in which he did not face a break point, according to Infosys ATP Stats. “As the tournament goes on, you try and find ways out of solutions and try to give yourself the best chance to play better the following day, and I did exactly that. It ended up being a great week here in Rotterdam. It's a place where I always feel really good. I was just a step short in the previous years, so it feels great to finally be able to lift the title." Auger-Aliassime was on an eight-match winning streak having lifted the title in Montpellier last week. The Canadian was targeting a ninth career indoor title to further strengthening his reputation as one of the most dangerous players under a roof. De Minaur, however, has been a consistent force at ATP 500 level in recent years, and his title charge in the Rotterdam final proved too much for the Canadian. “Congrats to Alex and your team,” Auger-Aliassime said during the trophy presentation. “We've played a lot of matches throughout the years… I tried my best today, but you were just a little bit too good. Shortly after, Auger-Aliassime left the court for medical treatment and returned looking short of his usual explosiveness. De Minaur sensed his opportunity and remained ruthless, closing out the match to reduce his Lexus ATP Head2Head deficit against the Canadian to 2-3. With his 78-minute win, De Minaur also jumped two spots to No. Get official marketing communications from the ATP and WTA!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings and has just completed the Career Grand Slam with his Australian Open win, he could be forgiven for sitting back and admiring his work so far in 2026. “Obviously I can see myself that [I have had] a lot of success so far, winning the biggest tournaments in the world,” said Alcaraz on Sunday at his pre-tournament press conference in Qatar. A lot of players, I know that they're trying to catch me up in terms of they are studying my game, they study how I play, trying to beat me, trying to challenge me. “I have to be ready for that, and I have to see where my level is, where my tennis is. I have to try to put myself in their minds and think what they could do when playing against me. One obvious example of the rivals Alcaraz was referring to is Jannik Sinner. Yet the 22-year-old Alcaraz has no intention of getting ahead of himself as he looks to better the quarter-final run he forged on Doha debut a year ago. Every match is different, our play is totally different,” said the Spaniard, who takes on Top 30 star Arthur Rinderknech in his opener. We can see the first matches how good matches that we have in the first round. “So [I'm] just thinking about a match at a time, and let's see how far I can go. If it's possible to play a final, obviously that would be great, and that's what I'm looking for, so let's see. I'm not thinking about playing or just putting myself in the final too early.

He first enjoyed a stopoff in Bahrain, where he visited his fellow Spanish sporting superstars Fernando Alonso and Carlos Sainz at F1 pre-season testing, but his focus has now fully shifted to trying to take his game to even greater heights in the Qatari capital. “Coming here, these days, my team and I, just we set up some goals for this tournament,” revealed the 25-time tour-level champion. “We are not talking about results at all. “That would be a really successful week for me, besides results. I [want to] see myself that I'm just doing the right things on and off the court.” Get official marketing communications from the ATP and WTA!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ben Shelton survived a major test from fellow lefty Denis Shapovalov on Saturday at the Nexo Dallas Open, where he prevailed in a final-set tie-break to reach the final. A lot of credit to Denis the way he's playing on this court," Shelton said. "It's a freight train coming at you." He saved 10 of the 11 break points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats, including a crucial save with a clutch volley at 2-2 in the second set and another save at 5-5 in the third set. Shelton will face top seed Taylor Fritz in the final. "I'm there, each and every match, putting myself in the position that I need to compete at the highest levels." In a match decided by fine margins, the top seed held his nerve to edge the Croatian 7-6(5), 7-6(3) in a gripping two-hour, two-minute clash, hammering 22 aces past the 37-year-old. Both players dominated with big deliveries in a match that featured no breaks. Fritz did not face a break point and struck 22 aces to Cilic's 16, including four in the first-set tie-break, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Although he failed to convert any of his five break-point chances, Fritz's composure on serve ultimately made the difference as he won 86 per cent (48/56) of his first-serve points. “That's something every tennis player experiences when you're the one in the opponent's service games," Fritz said. You'll go to the tie-break, all of a sudden some returns came back and I just told myself to be really ready in that tie-break." With the win, Fritz took a 3-1 lead in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series and advanced to his first final on home soil after reaching the US Open final in 2024. Cilic was hoping to reach his first final above the ATP 250 level since winning the Queen's Club title in 2018. With his semi-final run in Dallas, the Croat is up 18 spots to No. Your data will be used in accordance with the ATP Privacy Policy and WTA Privacy Policy.
