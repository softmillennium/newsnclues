For example, rather than relying on AI exclusively, Matthews said it might make sense to have a human handle drive-through orders at busy restaurants with long lines. “For our teams, we'll help coach them: at your restaurant, at these times, we recommend you use voice AI or recommend that you actually really monitor voice AI and jump in as necessary,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Friday, WhatsApp announced that it had patched a software vulnerability that was being used by unknown hackers to target specific users of Apple products and hack them with spyware. WhatsApp, which is owned by Meta, said in an advisory that the previously unknown bug “may have been exploited in a sophisticated attack against specific targeted users.” The vulnerability is officially dubbed CVE-2025-55177. Together, these vulnerabilities appear to have been the weak spots that allowed malicious spyware attacks targeting specific Apple users, intended to steal data from their devices, the outlet writes. Apple describes its bug as such: “Processing a malicious image file may result in memory corruption. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals.” Gizmodo reached out to Apple and WhatsApp for more information. “Our team at Amnesty International's Security Lab is actively investigating cases with a number of individuals targeted in this campaign,” Cearbhaill said on X. “We are available to support members of civil society who have received the WhatsApp notifications.” Zero-click attacks have become increasingly common and are frightening because, just as the name would suggest, they don't require any active phishing to penetrate into the inner contents of a person's mobile OS. Often, all a bad actor needs to do is send a malicious file (often an image), which can take over the phone by itself. Over the last several years, malware capable of zero-click attacks has been targeted at journalists, activists, and government officials—much of it originating from companies based in Israel.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As investments in artificial intelligence continue to soar, some analysts are raising alarms about a looming bubble that could burst and trigger broader market declines. Others, however, say they've never been so sure that it is a growing opportunity. Well, on Wall Street, there's a pick-your-flavor opinion for whatever it is you want to back, so we can't determine that. But we can show you what each side is thinking. Analysts and investors and even company CEOs of AI giants have expressed concerns that current valuations of AI-related stocks may be disconnected from their underlying fundamentals. Secondly, that growth is why those valuations are worth it. Despite recent concerns about overvaluation and a possible slowdown in AI-related growth, UBS analysts reaffirmed their positive outlook on the sector this week, buoyed by Nvidia's hotly anticipated quarterly results. In a note released after Nvidia reported earnings that exceeded expectations (but only just barely), UBS said that the core case for AI investment remains intact. “While valuations might appear stretched in the short term, the fundamental need for AI technology across industries continues to grow,” UBS wrote in a note to investors. The firm highlighted Nvidia's role as a leader in semiconductor and AI infrastructure, emphasizing that the company's robust revenue growth, which is projected at 48% for the current quarter, is a sign for ongoing demand for AI hardware and software solutions. Analysts also pointed out that the broader enterprise move toward integrating AI is supported by increasing capital spending, which bodes well for the sector's long-term prospects. “Investors should maintain conviction,” UBS added, “as the demand for scalable, high-performance AI platforms is only poised to accelerate.” Take OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, a man who is watching billions of dollars being poured into his competitors. Altman caused a major market rout when he said that investors are getting “over-excited” about AI. Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? Investors are also increasingly wary after reports that Meta is considering a “downsizing” of its artificial intelligence division, with some executives expected to depart. This potential shift marks a notable departure from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's recent heavy investments in transforming the company's AI operations. Over the past few months, Zuckerberg has championed a major overhaul of Meta's AI strategy, emphasizing its critical role in enhancing user experience and competing with rivals like OpenAI and Google. The planned changes have raised questions among market watchers about whether Meta's aggressive AI ambitions are being reassessed, or if internal challenges are forcing a strategic pivot. The move signals a period of uncertainty for Meta's AI efforts, which had been a key part of Zuckerberg's vision for the company's future growth While some experts acknowledge the transformative potential of AI, they caution investors to remain vigilant and avoid chasing speculative gains that lack proper valuation. “Even when the dotcom bubble burst, there were a handful of fairly obvious winners that eventually came roaring back,” said CNBC‘s Jim Cramer.

Amazon's Labor Day deals are here, and if you've ever thought about getting a portable power station, now's the perfect time to jump in. These handy devices are great for so many things like keeping your home running during unexpected outages, powering your gadgets while camping or even using at outdoor events. Amazon is offering an enormous 46% discount on Anker Solix C1000 portable power station bundled with a 200W solar panel. And if you want the power station alone, that also comes down to $449 from $799. Let's talk specs: the SOLIX C1000 packs 1800 watts of continuous power, backed by a big 1056Wh LiFePO4 battery. It has enough power to power multiple devices at once – like your fridge and fans, in addition to laptops and phones. The LiFePO4 battery is safer and more long-lasting than your typical lithium-ion batteries, so you can use it every day. It also contains a boost mode that reaches 2400 watts for those appliances which need extra power to start. The six AC outlets mean you can plug in multiple devices without ever sweating a drop. That's a giant bonus if you'd rather fill up your power station off the grid – perfect for camping trips or backup use during prolonged outages when you'd rather have clean, quiet power. You're going to have plenty of output possibilities here, including USB and DC jacks, so it's easy to keep everything powered. Safety-wise, the battery uses LiFePO4 technology that can handle heat and keep its capacity longer. It's a product that's designed to keep you charged and safe. As a whole, purchasing the Anker Solix C1000 with the solar panel for $699 in Amazon's Labor Day sale is one offer that it's difficult to pass on.

There has been news in the latter half of August that Windows update KB5063878 has reportedly been killing SSDs, especially when performing continuous file writes exceeding 50GB on a drive that's at least 60% full. One user claims that the bug affects how SSDs handle cache, and that models without DRAM and Phison NAND controllers are the most heavily affected. However, their further testing of 21 different SSDs revealed that drives using controllers from other brands seem to be affected as well. Although the issue does not seem to be widespread, more drama came out when a document containing a list of Phison controllers that were supposedly affected by the problem was widely circulated. Still, Phison recommends that users with heavy storage workloads install heatsinks on their SSDs if they haven't already done so to reduce the chances of thermal throttling. A few days after this, Microsoft also released its conclusion that there's no connection between the failed drives and the security update. It claimed that there was no increased risk of disk failure or file corruption after doing internal testing, and telemetry data also did not yield any meaningful results. Aside from that, the company claimed that no customer has reached out directly to its support teams with this same issue. Nevertheless, we still see a few posts on social media saying that their drive died after installing KB5063878. After all, we've seen big companies deny that there's anything wrong with their products only for us to discover later that there's a major issue with them (like Intel's instability issues). In the meantime, you should monitor your SSDs, especially if you're writing large files in a storage drive that's more than half full.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>GeekWire's startup coverage documents the Pacific Northwest entrepreneurial scene. I've been told by dentists and dental hygienists for the better part of my life that I could do a better job of flossing my teeth. Slate, which previously raised $800,000 in seed funding, recently raised another $1.75 million in a second seed round, according to an SEC filing. “When I got that data, I was like, ‘OK we can invest our energy in this,” said MacLennan, a mother of five who now runs the startup on her own. The device looks and handles like an electric toothbrush, similar to Sonicare. “That's what makes our product better than anything else,” MacLennan said of the Sweeps. We call them Gum Sweeps because they're a new design, and we invented them, and this is what's patented on our product.” The little triangles on either end of the floss are designed to go where your gums and teeth touch, and sonic vibrations from the flosser massage your gums and disrupt plaque. I use a Sonicare and have been using string floss and pick-style floss to varying degrees of success for years. After an initial test drive, the Slate flosser is certainly easier to use than wrapping string around my fingers. Slate recommends that the floss heads — available in a variety of colors — be changed every week. Kendra Cedana has been cleaning teeth for four years. She hadn't previously seen or used a Slate flosser, but admitted that the device looked “cool” and that that can sometimes be all it takes for people to get into habits they may otherwise avoid. Cedana watched how I used the flosser and then took her own turn using it on my teeth. Cedana demonstrated with a regular piece of string floss the technique that she would normally use, and it involved six distinct moves that cleaned the sides of my teeth as well as below the gum line. “Overall, I think manual, traditional flossing is going to be more effective,” Cedana said. Along with her hardware ambitions, MacLennan would love to innovate some software functions into the flosser, including the ability to communicate applicable data with high-tech wearables such as the Apple Watch or Oura Ring. The Slate flosser retails for $119 and a box of 20 floss heads is $25, available direct-to-consumer, on Amazon, and through some dental offices. A three-pack of Oral-B Glide Deep Clean Cool Mint Dental Floss is $10 at Walmart. MacLennan said the price of her device, manufactured at factories in China, Taiwan and the Philippines, is likely to go up soon due to President Trump's tariff policies.

One thing was missing, though: the actual power consumption number for these CPUs. AMD's current range-topping EPYC 9965 with 192 Zen 5 cores has a TDP of 500W (but a peak power consumption of around 700W), but judging from an OCP APAC Summit presentation, at least one of the company's partners — Taiwan Microloops Corp. — is preparing for a rather dramatic increase in SP7 CPU peak power consumption compared to existing processors. TMC appears to be developing custom cooling hardware for SP7 CPUs: a dual-loop water cooling system capable of handling thermal loads of around 1,400W. Heat is absorbed at the cold plate and transferred through a primary loop to the heat exchanger, where it is offloaded to a secondary loop connected to the chiller, ensuring sustained thermal performance at extremely high CPU power levels. The two charts by TMC confirm the system's efficiency and stability (i.e., it has been tested, although it is unclear whether on real Venice CPUs or heaters). One graph shows that thermal resistance remains nearly constant (~0.009°C/W) across loads ranging from 700 W to 1,400 W, demonstrating effective heat removal regardless of power level. Another chart shows a similarly stable pressure drop (~0.25 – 0.3 bar), indicating that the coolant flow remains unobstructed even under maximum load, which demonstrates that the cooling solution is viable for long-term use. Together, these results demonstrate that AMD's SP7 platform is engineered to reliably support kilowatt-class CPUs without degradation in thermal or hydraulic performance. One thing to note is that the 1,400W figure associated with AMD's SP7 platform and next-generation EPYC processors does not definitively indicate their TDP. Instead, it more likely reflects peak power consumption under full load or stress conditions, not the base TDP. One interesting thing to note about the presentation is that Taiwan Microloops Corp. is preparing standard coolant distribution units (CDUs) with refrigeration capacities ranging from 60 kW to 800 kW, which are suitable for full-rack or multi-rack liquid cooling deployments. To some degree, this means that liquid cooling has a long road ahead of it before immersion cooling becomes a viable option several years down the road.

Sudokoo's Proteus 360 is one of the best-performing AIOs you can buy. But its high price and pump whine in its default configuration make it hard to recommend against competitors. Best PBO tested result with AMD's Ryzen 9 9950X3D Pump whines unless the operating speed is reduced Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Sudokoo is a new cooling brand from Singapore that we first encountered at CES 2025, where it unveiled an initial lineup of AIOs, fans, and air coolers. We're taking a look at one of those products today: the Proteus 360. The Proteus 360 is an especially powerful AIO in our testing, as you'll see in our benchmarks section – and it stands out from the crowd with a 3.4-inch display that can be customized to show a variety of performance metrics or a video of your choosing using the company's MasterCraft software suite. Will this new cooler make our list of best CPU coolers on the market? It carries a price tag of $269 USD, so the bar for what we expect from this cooler is set high. We'll first go over the features of this cooler, then get to the benchmarks with AMD and Intel CPUs so that you can determine if this cooler is right for you. Higher-end AIOs have been shipping with screens for years now, but usually with smaller screens that are hard to see or read from inside the case. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. The default configuration runs in “Office Mode,” which generally limits sound levels to less than 38.2 dBA. A “silent mode” is also available, where the fans rarely spin up. And of course, there's a performance profile for those who want maximum cooling. Those who want full control over the fan or pump speeds can click the “Pro” button to enable detailed tuning. You can choose from GPU load, GPU frequency, GPU temp, CPU temp, CPU load, CPU frequency, network statistics, RAM usage, the current time, and the RPM levels of the pump or fans (shown below). The size of each metric can also be changed. Many of these metrics can also be displayed in graphs (shown below). You can also upload animated images or movie files to be shown on the display, if that interests you. It also features two extra ports that can be used to control the PWM and ARGB settings of other fans not connected to the AIO. Many coolers include backplates barely strong enough to do the job, but not Sudokoo includes an overbuilt backplate that is solid and sturdy. This appears to be the same backplate used by DeepCool in its Assassin VC Elite – though with one difference: DeepCool's implementation has a layer added to the top. Users who prefer silence will be happy to know these fans support zero-RPM operation – and while running the cooler in its silent mode, the fans will often remain turned off! This usually means improved performance, but can also lead to compatibility issues in cramped cases. So make sure your case has room for thicker fans before buying this cooler.Sudokoo ships the cooler with the fans pre-installed for convenience. AMD users, as usual, will have to remove the default mounting mechanism. This is a simple task on AMD systems, but you'll need to hold the backplate in place until the cooler is secured on Intel systems, unless you choose to add some double-sided tape to the inside of the backplate before installing. Finally, connect the PWM and USB cables to your motherboard. Power on your computer and you're good to go. This means I test CPU coolers inside a closed desktop case, which increases cooling difficulty compared to other testing methods. Open benches have lowered ambient temperatures, which in turn makes weak coolers appear stronger than they really are. Some publications have used generic thermal plates to test cooling solutions. I reject both of these methods because they don't accurately reflect the real-world conditions where a CPU cooler is used. A system's motherboard can also influence this, especially if it suffers from bending, which results in poor cooler contact with the CPU. In order to prevent bending from impacting our cooling results, we've installed Thermalright's LGA 1700 contact frame into our testing rig. Not all motherboards are affected equally by this issue. I tested Raptor Lake CPUs in two motherboards. And while one of them showed significant thermal improvements after installing Thermalright's LGA1700 contact frame, the other motherboard showed no difference in temperatures whatsoever! Check out our review of the contact frame for more information. We've recently added testing of AMD's new flagship sixteen-core Ryzen 9 9950X3D. This impressive CPU provides the best gaming and multithreaded performance on the market, and it can prove quite challenging thermally, particularly when PBO is enabled for overclocking.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But Google Forms can also be used for malicious purposes. These forms can be created in minutes, with clean and clear formatting, official-looking images and video, and—most importantly of all—a genuine Google Docs URL that your web browser will see no problem with. Scammers can then use these authentic-looking forms to ask for payment details or login information. Students and staff at Stanford University were among those targeted with a Google Forms link that asked for login details for the academic portal there, and the attack beat standard email malware protection. These scams can take a variety of guises, but they'll typically start with a phishing email that will try to trick you into believing it's an official and genuine communication. Our inboxes are regularly filled with requests to reset passwords, verify details, or otherwise take action. Even worse, the instigating email might actually come from a legitimate email address, if someone in your social circle, family, or office has had their account hijacked. This email (or perhaps a direct message on social media) will be used to deliver a Google Forms link, which is the second half of the scam. This form will most often be set up to look genuine, and may be trying to spoof a recognized site like your place of work or your bank. The form might prompt you for sensitive information, offer up a link to malware, or feature a phone number or email address to lead you into further trouble. It's also easy for scammers to quickly close and reopen these forms on different random URLs, making it harder for them to be caught by security software. Since they're free to create, scammers aren't losing anything by making vast numbers of them. The same set of common sense measures are usually enough to keep yourself safe against most scams, including this one. Be wary of any unexpected communications, like unusual requests for friends or password reset processes you haven't yourself triggered. In general, you shouldn't be entering any login information or payment details into a Google Forms document (it will start with docs.google.com in your browser's address bar). These forms may look reasonably well presented, but they'll lack any advanced formatting or layouts, and will feature Submit and Clear form buttons at the bottom. Google Forms should also have either a “never submit passwords” or “content is neither created nor endorsed by Google” message at the bottom, depending on how the form has been set up. These are all signs you can look for, even if the link to the form appears to have come from a trusted source. And if you're being asked for important information, then get in touch with that source directly. Even just knowing that this kind of scam exists is a step toward being better protected. As always, keeping your mobile and desktop software up-to-date helps too. This won't necessarily flag a suspect form, for the reasons we've already mentioned, but it should mean that any malicious links you're directed to are recognized.

When it's time to wind down, even a thin beam of streetlight coming through the curtains or the glow of a phone charger can keep your brain from fully switching off. A well-made sleep mask that blocks the light can help you drift off faster and stay asleep even through sunrise. From luxurious silk masks to high-tech sleeping goggles, there's a sleep mask for every need. Below, we break down what to look for in a sleep mask, the benefits each type offers, and how to get the most out of one so you can sleep like you mean it. We're here to break down all the things you should consider. Sleep masks do more than just block out light. Light is the most powerful cue for your circadian rhythm. Even the tiniest bit of light exposure can suppress melatonin and delay sleep. “Most research has been conducted in hospitals due to the noise and lights,” says sleep physician Lourdes DelRosso. Just by covering their eyes, we can promote better production of melatonin and send better signals to our brain.” Wearing sleep masks at night can also aid cognitive function, including memory, alertness, and episodic learning, according to a study from the Sleep Research Society. Wearing sleep masks at night can also aid cognitive function, including memory, alertness, and episodic learning, according to a study from the Sleep Research Society. And it's not just the blackout effect of sleep masks that gives users a well-rested night. Sleep masks are a healthy sleep association, providing a relaxing and comforting experience that can help you wind down at night. “We have touch receptors everywhere on our skin, including around the eyes,” certified sleep expert Annika Carroll says. “If we apply a little bit of light pressure there with this mask, it releases a hormone called oxytocin, often referred to as the love hormone. If you're prone to migraines, eye masks can be a simple and powerful ally. Light pressure around the eyes can help ease tension and increase blood flow, while total darkness helps reduce light sensitivity, a common migraine trigger. Wearing an eye mask while you sleep protects the delicate skin around your eyes from rubbing against bedding or your arm, especially if you tend to toss and turn. Sleep mask fits aren't universal, Carroll says: “I find that there's a bit of trial and error in finding a mask that fits your face shape. There are rounder faces, and there are slimmer, longer faces.” Be sure to try on a new sleep mask before giving it a whirl; the mask should press gently against your face without feeling too tight, and there should be no gaps between the mask and your skin, especially around the nose. Additionally, several sleep mask characteristics may affect how well it fits on your face. These types are generally lighter and more compact, making them easy to travel with. Many sleep masks today are designed with a contoured nose or without fabric around the nose to prevent any light from penetrating. Some eye masks are built like swim goggles: They feature two convex gaps that allow you to fully open and close your eyes beneath the mask without letting any light in. Luckily, many sleep masks come with an adjustable strap so you can customize the fit. When shopping for a sleep mask, examine the product to locate any clasps or adjustable closures. Stomach sleepers may find a clasp at the back more comfortable. For those who change positions frequently, consider an unobtrusive adjustment and/or closure mechanism like slim Velcro, a magnetic closure, or a slide buckle. When testing it out, lie in your preferred sleep position and move around a bit—if the mask feels restrictive or shifts when you do, you may need to adjust the tightness. Keep in mind that some mechanisms hold up better over time—velcro can wear down, while buckles and magnetic closures usually last longer. You should also be cognizant of the materials that make up these sleep aids since they'll be hugging your face all night long. This fine material is all the rage in the beauty world as it has been clinically proven to be biocompatible with human skin, supporting hydration, improving skin elasticity, and increasing cellular regeneration (which reduces fine lines and wrinkles). It's also cooling on the skin, which can be refreshing for hot sleepers. Cotton is the goldilocks of eye masks; it's comfortable, easy to wash, durable, and breathable. Be mindful that cotton absorbs moisture, so this material may be best avoided if you use an eye cream at night. If you want more than a standard mask, consider these upgrades. Sleep masks are sometimes filled with flaxseed and rice infused with these essential oils, creating a weighted effect as well as providing aromatherapeutic benefits. As we mentioned above, gentle pressure around the eyes is a physiological means for relaxation and stress relief. Weighted eye masks can also help relax facial muscles and reduce discomfort in sinus cavities. Some sleep masks are engineered to be cooled with refrigerable gel inserts, while others are made with breathable temperature-regulating fabric (like polyester) that releases heat. The chill can also soothe tension headaches and migraines. Second to sight, sound plays a crucial role in a good night's sleep—so much so that today, some high-tech sleep masks even come with speakers built into the areas near the ears. Sleep masks are a simple way to help your sleep cycle, but there are a few circumstances where they're not ideal. No matter how clean you think your face is when you rest your head on your pillow at night, sleep masks can accumulate dirt, oils, dust, and more allergens that could potentially lead to breakouts or infections. Regular cleaning also helps extend the life of the mask, so be sure to wash it weekly if worn nightly, or a few times a week if you have sensitive skin or eyes. When you're not wearing it, store your sleep mask in a secure location such as inside your nightstand or a dresser drawer to keep dust and dander buildup at bay. Also, tempting as it is, try not to perch it on your head in the morning—hair oils, sweat, and hair products can transfer onto the mask that way. Avoid leaving a sleep mask in direct sunlight or hot spots, such as a windowsill or car dashboard, since heat and UV exposure can wear down sleep mask materials like silk, elastic, foam, and gel. If you're taking it on the go, keep it in a small pouch or case to protect it from dirt and grime in your bag and to prevent straps from getting tangled or stretched.

Apple has officially set a date for its iPhone September event, which is due to take place on September 9. This year's launch will be held at the Steve Jobs Theater on Apple's campus in Cupertino, California. These are rumored to be color choices for the iPhone 17 Pro devices. The logo also moves like a heat map on Apple's website, which could allude to potential thermal improvements in the upcoming devices, or the rumored switch back to aluminum instead of titanium on the iPhone Pro models (which would also improve thermals, anyway). Oura, the leading global manufacturer of smart rings, announced this week that it has plans to build a manufacturing facility in Fort Worth, Texas. Oura's largest enterprise customer is the Department of Defense, and US-based manufacturing operations will support its needs. It notes that its rings are being used in four key research areas: stress management and resilience, fitness optimization, fatigue risk management, and early illness detection. Here's more you may have missed this week: This announcement comes at a time when the smart ring industry is going through lots of shake-ups. The US International Trade Commission recently ruled in favor of Oura in a patent infringement case against competitors Ultrahuman and Ringconn, which have had to pull their respective rings from the US market. This is particularly bad news for Ultrahuman, which has a facility in Plano, Texas, where the company was planning to manufacture rings in the US to get around tariffs. We'll keep an eye on the situation as it evolves, but for now, US customers might only be able to buy an Oura ring. Plaud makes a credit card-sized AI note-taking device that listens to the world around you and then transcribes conversations, summarizing them into meeting notes with actionable insights. It shares a similar card-shaped design with the original, but now it features two extra microphones to pick up audio at a wider range. Just long-press the button once to start recording. You can highlight key information during a meeting with a short press, and you can type in the phone app simultaneously to add your thoughts; they'll be contextualized to the recording instantly. Plaud also lets you snap a photo with your phone to add additional context. Plaud's Note Pro can identify and label individual speakers in its transcriptions, and it can transcribe 112 languages. You can also ask Plaud (via the app) a specific question from your notes, so there's no need to hunt for key details. It employs large language models from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. The Note Pro is up for preorder now and ships in October. (There's a plan that offers unlimited transcription minutes for $240 annually.) Level Home makes some of the sneakiest smart locks you'll find. The new Level Lock Pro embraces that design ethos. It looks like a simple front door lock with a small face, and doesn't look large enough to have smart home features. There's no keypad (though you can purchase one for $79) or biometric reader, but it does work with Apple's Home keys or NFC key fobs, along with a physical key. It can connect to devices via Bluetooth if your Wi-Fi goes down. It also has door status detection, so it can tell you whether the door is closed or ajar without any additional accessories. The Level Lock Pro is available now for $349 and comes in either a black matte or silver finish. Chipolo's been making Bluetooth trackers we like for a while, but you've always had to manually replace the battery. Chipolo's new Card and Loop trackers are rechargeable, and the company claims six months of battery life on a single charge. The larger card-sized tracker is designed for wallets, while the little Loop is a small circle you can add to a keyring, dog collar, or even sneak into your kid's backpack. While Chipolo has been our favorite for Android, it works with both Apple and Android's native device-tracking apps (Find My and Find Hub, respectively), and Chipolo has a companion app that the tracker will pair with for extra features. Chipolo doesn't include any chargers or cords, so choose the model you've already got the equipment for. It has a 10.9-inch screen that can hit up to 600 nits of peak brightness, Samsung's Exynos 1380 processor (the same as in the Galaxy A26), and starts with 6 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage. It starts at $349 and goes on sale September 4. This week, Samsung announced a virtual Galaxy Event on September 4, kicking off the festivities at the IFA consumer tech show in Berlin. That's likely where we'll learn more about these flagship Android tablets, and likely the Galaxy S25 FE midrange smartphone. Early in the week, I received an anonymous email from someone claiming that Nothing had used stock photography to pass as photos shot with the company's Phone (3), which launched early in July. This source provided a screen recording of an in-store demo unit that showed a handful of images, which Nothing claimed were shot on the Phone (3). Most of these photos were on the Stills photo licensing platform, so I reached out to two of the photographers—Roman Fox and Henry Han—and both claimed Nothing purchased the photos under a standard digital use license. Clearly, none of the photos in these demo units were shot by a Nothing smartphone. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. Nothing cofounder Akis Evangelidis took to X to break down what happened, citing that initial live demo units need placeholder images four months before the launch of the phone. These are supposed to be replaced as the company enters mass production with actual photo samples with a new version of the live demo unit. “It was brought to our attention that some live demo units' stock imagery were not updated,” Evangelidis says. The company is working to rectify this so that all demo units reflect the latest version, with no stock photography. Han points out that Nothing licensed the photos from April 28, 2025, through October 28, 2026, which doesn't quite line up with Evangelidis' timeline and also runs for longer than necessary. All of which suggests that the company isn't lying. Maybe just use Phone (2) sample images as a placeholder next time.
