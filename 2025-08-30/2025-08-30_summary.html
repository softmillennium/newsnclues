Wikipedia is being pressed to release names of specific editors, a tactic seemingly pushed by the Heritage Foundation.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

A pair of House Republicans is moving forward with an investigation that will seek to reveal the identities of Wikipedia editors who have edited articles to include information that portrays Israel negatively.

On Wednesday, Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.), chair of the House Oversight Committee, and Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), chair of the House Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation, sent a letter to the Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit that owns the free encyclopedia.

The representatives asked Wikimedia's CEO, Maryana Iskander, for “assistance in obtaining documents and communications regarding individuals (or specific accounts) serving as Wikipedia volunteer editors who violated Wikipedia platform policies as well as your own efforts to thwart intentional, organized efforts to inject bias into important and sensitive topics.”

The letter requested information about “nation state actors” or “academic institutions” that may have been involved in efforts to “edit or influence content identified as possibly violating Wikipedia policies.”

A spokesperson for the Wikimedia Foundation told The Hill that they were reviewing the request.

“We welcome the opportunity to respond to the committee's questions and to discuss the importance of safeguarding the integrity of information on our platform,” the spokesperson said.

The GOP investigation coincides with a long-standing objective of the far-right Heritage Foundation, which has accused Wikipedia of anti-conservative bias and promoting content that portrays Israel in a negative light, and sought to unmask the identities of the internet users who run it.

The letter sent by Comer and Mace requests that Wikimedia provide Congress with “records showing identifying and unique characteristics of accounts (such as names, IP addresses, registration dates, user activity logs) for editors” who have been “subject to actions” by Wikipedia's Arbitration Committee, which resolves internal disputes between editors.

It was, in essence, a request by Congress for Wikipedia to “dox” many of its editors.

“In the culture of Wikipedia editing, it is common for individuals to use pseudonyms to protect their privacy and avoid personal threats,” wrote tech writer and Wikipedia expert Stephen Harrison for Slate in February. “Revealing an editor's personal information without their consent, a practice known as doxing, is a form of harassment that can result in a user's being permanently banned from the site.”

Of chief concern to the legislators is investigating Wikipedia's handling of content related to Israel. They cited a report from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a pro-Israel lobbying group, which the legislators said “raised troubling questions about potentially systematic efforts to advance antisemitic and anti-Israel information in Wikipedia articles related to conflicts with the state of Israel.”

The ADL report makes the allegation that 30 “bad-faith” Wikipedia editors, whose identities are not public, were collaborating to edit pages about the Israel-Palestine conflict by “spotlighting criticism of Israel and downplaying Palestinian terrorist violence and antisemitism,” and in the process violating Wikipedia's commitment to neutrality.

That report, however, has been heavily criticized, including by some of the academics it cited. In a piece for The Forward, Shira Klein, whose research on Wikipedia's documentation of the Holocaust appears in the report, said the ADL “inaccurately” used her work, and the work of others, as part of its “ramped-up efforts to police public discourse about Israel,” and quoted other researchers who felt the same.

Klein described the study's interpretation of the facts as “very skewed” and said it was reliant “on a faulty premise: that criticism of Israel or Zionism is inherently antisemitic.”

“To establish foul play, the ADL would need to demonstrate that Wikipedia content about Israel and Zionism regularly expresses as fact ideas that diverge from broadly held scholarly opinions on the matters in question,” Klein said. “But where is the evidence of editors repeatedly misrepresenting or contradicting peer-reviewed literature? There is none. The report simply wants us to take the ADL's word for it.”

The ADL's report, as well as a similar report from the Atlantic Council alleging that Wikipedia editors had conspired to spread pro-Kremlin propaganda, are the sole pieces of evidence cited by Comer and Mace in their request for identifying information on Wikipedia's editors.

However, right-wing efforts to undermine Wikipedia's independence and attack the privacy of its editors go back much further.

In January, documents obtained by The Forward's Arno Rosenfeld revealed a secret plan by Heritage, the think tank behind the authoritarian Project 2025 playbook, to “identify and target Wikipedia editors” who the organization said were “abusing their position.”

Among the methodologies it directed Heritage employees to use include “analyzing text patterns, usernames, and technical data through data breach analysis, fingerprinting, [human intelligence], and technical targeting.”

The targeting methods also included “creating fake Wikipedia user accounts to try to trick editors into identifying themselves by sharing personal information or clicking on malicious tracking links that can identify people who click on them.”

According to Rosenfeld, “The Heritage Foundation sent the pitch deck outlining the Wikipedia initiative to Jewish foundations and other prospective supporters of Project Esther, its roadmap for fighting antisemitism and anti-Zionism.”

Jewish Voice for Peace has described Project Esther as Heritage's “blueprint for using the federal government and private institutions to dismantle then Palestine solidarity movement and broader US civil society, under the guise of ‘fighting antisemitism.'”

“Even if you take issue with how the site is currently framing the conflict, that doesn't justify Heritage's plan,” Harrison wrote. “Targeting Wikipedia editors personally, instead of debating their edits on the platform, marks a dangerous escalation.”

Coming amid the Trump administration's crackdowns against campus protests and efforts to deport immigrants over pro-Palestine speech, critics have described the House Republican investigation as the latest GOP attempt to censor criticism and the spread of unflattering information about Israel.

Adam Johnson, a co-host for the political podcast Citations Needed, described it in a post on X as “House Republicans working with the ADL and Atlantic Council to discipline Wikipedia into parroting the Israeli and NATO line.”

Johnson noted that this push was coming as the clear majority of Americans, including an overwhelming number of Democrats, now oppose US support for Israel, with many now believing the country is committing a genocide.

“Rather than end the genocide,” Johnson said, “the response instead is to continue firing, doxing, smearing, and attempting to censor inconvenient narratives.”

In June 2025, the Trump administration pressured University of Virginia (UVA) president James Ryan to resign, threatening to withdraw federal funding due to an alleged lack of compliance with civil rights law. Like other elite higher education institutions such as Harvard, Columbia, the University of Pennsylvania, and many others targeted by the Trump administration, UVA capitulated to the coercive authority and dictatorial weaponization of civil rights law.

UVA buckled under the pressure of a series of anti-DEI and anti-higher education executive orders issued by Donald Trump during his second term as president, targeting colleges and universities that resisted his racist, sexist, and transphobic agenda. The Trump administration has also targeted the college accreditation system in order to, among other goals, maintain ideological control over what is taught in university classrooms. 

These and other executive orders targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs and policies, and the autonomy of higher education institutions, rest on the erroneous idea that white people are victims of racial discrimination rather than the perpetrators and beneficiaries of an unjust system. My goal as an educator is to challenge these and other inaccurate beliefs in the classroom.

I've been teaching university students in Virginia since 2009, and during the past 16 years at least one of my students every year has expressed the belief that colleges routinely use “quotas” as part of their admissions process, and that Black students benefit unfairly from this practice. This is shocking, considering that the Supreme Court issued the decision to make the use of quotas in college admissions illegal in 1978, almost 50 years ago. I typically ask my students: How is it possible that such a blatantly inaccurate idea could persist for almost half a century? And what purpose do these false narratives serve within American society?

The fact that these false narratives persist despite evidence to the contrary reflects the power of two deeply held ideologies in the United States. First, systematic disinformation about affirmative action is rooted in anti-Blackness, a racist ideology that specifically and uniquely targets people who are racially identified as Black. Throughout the history of the United States, people of African descent have served the function of being the prototypical “other,” the group that represents the least desirable of all the undesirables. As sociologist Vilna Bashi Treitler wrote in her book The Ethnic Project, in order to gain favor from white people, nonwhite groups have historically distanced themselves from Black people or denigrated Black people in order to gain white acceptance, or to simply avoid being treated as badly as a Black person. 

Anti-Blackness is at the heart of anti-affirmative action rhetoric by suggesting that “unqualified” Black students have stolen spots from “qualified” white students. The backlash against affirmative action is also rooted in the deeply held belief in the ideology of meritocracy, which posits that success results from our natural talents, individual efforts and abilities. The persistence of the inaccurate belief that racial quotas are being used in college admissions is evidence of the effectiveness of racist ideologies and the power they have to maintain the current system of racial capitalism in the United States.

How is it possible that such a blatantly inaccurate idea could persist for almost half a century? And what purpose do these false narratives serve within American society?

In his book Black Marxism, late political scientist Cedric Robinson used the term “racial capitalism” to highlight the interconnected and interdependent relationship between racism and modern capitalism. Racial capitalism as a concept posits that modern capitalism was always rooted in the exploitation of racialized “others”; it was not just an economic system rooted in class exploitation as some Marxists believe.

Chattel slavery of Africans is one of the clearest examples of racial capitalism in the United States. European colonizers used the ideology of white supremacy as a form of propaganda to dehumanize the personhood of Africans and their descendants in order to justify the inhumane methods used to extract free labor from which white settlers profited financially. Indeed, slavery is at the root of the success of most U.S. financial institutions — and, many of these institutions, like Wells Fargo, continue to profit from racially predatory and discriminatory practices. 

Higher education institutions have historically played a key role in perpetuating racial capitalism in the United States. They benefited directly and indirectly from profits generated from the free labor of enslaved Africans whose descendants have never received reparations for hundreds of years of wage and labor theft. “Meritocracy” is an ideological weapon that the descendants of European colonizers currently use to justify a system built on the exploitation and dehumanization of Black bodies. The idea of meritocracy is used to justify a society where executive orders are created to legislate a white-centered and flawed teaching of history intended to keep the masses ignorant of how deeply inequitable this country is and has always been. Meritocracy also functions as a psychological prop for white folks who need to believe that they deserve to have more than other groups — that whiteness is in fact better, smarter, and more competent. Meritocracy cannot exist in a system rooted in racial capitalism, where racialized groups are exploited for the benefit of a more powerful majority group, and racial capitalism is as foundational to the U.S. economy, its financial, and its educational institutions as apple pie. 

Anti-Blackness and racial capitalism in higher education has evolved and adapted to the colorblind ideology of the post-Civil Rights Era. Reminiscent of Lee Atwater's “Southern Strategy,” white supremacy now draws on race-neutral language and dog whistles to make racist claims while maintaining plausible deniability. White public figures like President Donald Trump have reframed affirmative action policies designed initially to address centuries of systemic racism against Black people as “discriminatory” and “unmeritocratic” (“reverse racism”), despite the lack of empirical evidence to support this belief.

The persistence of the inaccurate belief that racial quotas are being used in college admissions is evidence of the effectiveness of racist ideologies and the power they have to maintain the current system of racial capitalism in the United States.

The myth of meritocracy plays an important ideological role in perpetuating racial capitalism in the U.S. Racial capitalism is about crafting an ideology that rationalizes the exploitation of racialized groups such that their exploitation is viewed as normal. The widespread misrepresentation of affirmative action policies as “unmeritocratic” fulfills this purpose by normalizing racial gaps in educational attainment and economic outcomes. Additionally, the use of inequitable gate-keeping tools such as Scholastic Assessment Tests (SATs) and legacy policies that advantage the children of white elites and students belonging to an upper socioeconomic status in college admissions are tools of white supremacy (anti-Blackness in particular) that provide metaphorical fuel for the engine of racial capitalism. 

The  SATs were created by Carl Bigham, a eugenicist who believed that Black people were intellectually inferior to white people, and that U.S. public education would progressively decline as white people intermixed with other races. True to its eugenicist roots, many studies have documented that the SATs continue to be biased against Black students and other students of color, as well as against low-income students. For example, sociologist Joseph Soares points to the biased practice of excluding experimental SAT questions from the exam when Black students perform better on them than white students. Soares also notes that Black students perform better than white students on tests that are based on the delivery of a curriculum actually taught in high school. However, the SATs were developed to assess “aptitude” for learning, not competence in a particular subject matter. It is no surprise, then, that Black students do not perform as well on the SATs as their white (and Asian) peers. 

Yet, SATs have become a staple requirement for admission to most colleges and universities, following Harvard, which started to require them in 1935. In 1969 Bowdoin college was the first to adopt a test-optional policy, followed by other liberal arts colleges such as Bates in 1984. This policy was not adopted by a critical mass of institutions until the early 2000s, such that, just before the pandemic of 2020, approximately 47 percent of colleges and universities had gone test-optional. During the 2020 pandemic, over 90 percent of colleges and universities decided to make SATs optional or did not consider them at all. However, as of April 2025, a growing list of public, private, and Ivy League schools have decided to reinstate the SATs as a requirement for college admissions, despite evidence of the SATs' racial and class-based bias. 

In essence, colleges and universities have rebranded the SATs, an artifact of eugenics ideology, as a meritocratic tool to justify why the children of the white bourgeoise deserve to be at elite institutions of higher education, and why they deserve to get the jobs that pay the most money. When there are mechanisms in place that systematically limit the ability for Black students to attend and graduate from college, these barriers play a de facto role in perpetuating racial capitalism.

In tandem with the SATs, white elites created legacy admissions, the special preference given to the relatives of alumni, to prevent or at least limit the matriculation of Jewish students at Harvard, who, like Black Americans then and now, were considered “racial undesirables” in the 1920s United States. Selective private institutions are more likely to consider legacy status than public institutions, so this policy disproportionately benefits students from economically privileged backgrounds. 

Unsurprisingly, none of the arguments put forth for why colleges and universities continue to use legacy admissions relate to “merit.” In fact, non-legacies at Harvard, for example, outperform legacies in every category except athletics. And, despite a general consensus among 75 percent of Americans that the utilization of legacy admissions policies is an inequitable practice, there has not been the same intense public uproar or targeted legal battle to undermine it as there has been against the use of affirmative action in college admissions. Legacy admissions, like the SATs, help to keep the system of racial capitalism alive by ensuring that children of white elites get academic credentials from the most prestigious academic institutions, giving the false impression that they are the most competent and qualified. And, because college-educated individuals make, on average, higher salaries than those who do not attend college, a college degree is a gateway for economic success and upward mobility. In addition, graduates from more selective schools — those that are more likely to require SATs and utilize legacy admissions policies — have higher graduation rates and higher earnings in business and social science disciplines. Clearly, the SATs and legacy admissions practices are functioning exactly as intended — to keep “racial undesirables” from accessing higher education or relegating them to less prestigious and less resourced schools.

The relationship between anti-Blackness and racial capitalism in U.S. higher education institutions has roots that extend far beyond the early 20th century. A 2022 report published by the Presidential Committee on Harvard & the Legacy of Slavery acknowledges that Harvard University presidents, faculty, staff, and students benefited from the labor of enslaved Black people from its founding in 1636 until it became illegal in Massachusetts in 1783. Harvard continued to benefit from slavery through the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries through donors who accumulated their wealth from slave trading as well as through the coerced and unpaid labor of enslaved people on plantations in the American South and the Caribbean. 

Harvard is not unique, as is evidenced in the 2013 book Ebony & Ivy written by Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor and historian Craig Wilder. Wilder identifies several other Ivy League schools in the Northeast, such as Columbia, Brown, Princeton, and Dartmouth, that benefited from profits gained from the enslavement of Black people and the theft of their labor. What this historical context reveals, is that higher education institutions in the United States have played a significant role in perpetuating a system of racial capitalism rooted in anti-Blackness. This means that anti-affirmative action rhetoric is blatantly and intentionally ahistorical, and survives due in large part to an active investment in maintaining white ignorance.

Current anti–affirmative action and anti-DEI rhetoric are rooted in the same white supremacist and anti-Black racial ideologies and logics that fueled slavery-era racial capitalism in the United States. In June 2023, these were the ideological and rhetorical tools that the predominantly white and conservative Supreme Court used to dismantle affirmative action in college admissions. 

In higher education institutions, the reframing of affirmative action as a program that makes it possible for unqualified Black students to take the place of qualified white ones is a convenient narrative that legitimizes gate-keeping systems designed to exclude Black students and other students of color from earning credentials that could lead to upward mobility. In the meantime, the children of white elite families continue to benefit from legacy admissions policies that give them an unfair advantage in college admissions. Unsurprisingly, despite evidence that both SATs and legacy admissions have racist roots and are biased against low-income students and students with minoritized racial identities, the Trump administration has yet to prioritize this as an inequitable practice that the administration should address to be consistent with their avowed commitment to a meritocratic society.

“The danger posed to our collective communities … is very real,” said one employee who signed a public letter.

Nearly 200 employees of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) signed an extraordinary letter sent to Congress on August 25, denouncing the current administration's erosion of their work and warning that it risks the occurrence of another Hurricane Katrina-sized disaster. More than 30 provided their names; the rest signed anonymously.

Named the Katrina Declaration, the letter was one of the most powerful written so far by beleaguered federal employees attempting to salvage their agencies from a predatory administration seemingly intent on bulldozing basic government functions. They have followed up on this by asking people around the country to join them in their protest by endorsing the letter.

“I knew that if I didn't sign this letter I would feel as though I was failing in my duty to protect the public I swore an oath to serve; that I would feel complicit in the false narratives this administration has been working so hard to drive about their intentions with FEMA when I've seen only evidence to the contrary,” one of the signatories told me. Like most of those who spoke to me, she requested anonymity, fearing retribution from the Trump administration. “In the end, I knew that more people would die if I did not help raise the alarm. So I did. And I am. And I will continue to do so.”

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

The authors didn't pull punches, arguing that the administration is violating the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act, which Congress passed in 2006 to improve FEMA's performance after the agency's dismal failures following the devastation the hurricane wrought upon New Orleans twenty years ago this week. The Trumpified Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the parent department to FEMA, is slashing funding to vital FEMA services. And the department is insisting that all grants in excess of $100,000 be personally approved by DHS Secretary Kristi Noem — a choice that has created a huge backlog in contracts.

Due to the new influx in red tape, residents of states facing the aftermath of natural disasters, such as Texas, which faced devastating floods in July; and North Carolina, which suffered huge storm-related losses earlier this year, have already faced huge delays in receiving assistance from FEMA. Contractors who run phone help lines and other vital services connecting the public to the agency have been mothballed and specialists have been taken off their regular jobs to help staff these cratering phone systems. Throughout the year, the department has systematically placed obstacles in the way of disaster preparedness and risk-mitigation programs around the country. And it has blocked all climate change-related disaster preparation and mitigation work, as well as analysis of future risks generated by climate change, despite the overwhelming evidence indicating climate change is real and is accelerating.

“Our shared commitment to our country, our oaths of office, and our mission of helping people before, during, and after disasters compel us to warn Congress and the American people of the cascading effects of decisions made by the current administration,” the FEMA signatories explained in their letter. “We the undersigned — current and former FEMA workers — have come together to sound the alarm to our administrators, the US Congress, and the American people so that we can continue to lawfully uphold our individual oaths of office and serve our country as our mission dictates.”

“I desperately want it [the letter] to make a difference,” Katherine Landers told Truthout. A geospatial risk analyst, Landers helps generate the census tract-level National Risk Index — used by home-owners, businesses, town planners and insurance companies to estimate potential environmental hazards facing neighborhoods throughout the country. “I don't want this to be in vain,” Landers said.

Landers was motivated to sign the letter by a growing sense of horror at how vulnerable the administration was leaving the general public to disasters, due to the cuts and the bureaucratic requirements they were imposing on FEMA staff. In particular, she was stunned by the war on science. And she, along with her colleagues, was outraged at how chaotic the response was to the deadly floods in Texas this summer — and by the fact that the contractors who ought to have been helping flood victims apply for relief funds and other services weren't able to work because Noem hadn't approved their contracts.

In December 2024, Landers and her colleagues released a Future Risk Index, based on years of climate change research from FEMA and other government science agencies. The index analyzed how risks from a slew of natural hazards would shift over the coming years as climate change accelerated, and also identified which communities would be left most vulnerable. In February 2025, in the wake of Trump's executive orders clamping down on climate change research and anything that could be seen as bolstering diversity, equity, and inclusion, FEMA was forced to remove the index — taking offline not only the climate change research but also the analysis of how differing socio-economic conditions would create disparate impacts across different communities in the face of a warming planet. Landers and her colleagues were also sent a long list of climate change-related words that they were no longer allowed to keep up on their website. “The executive orders are forcing us to turn a blind eye to where the best science is,” Landers said. “It's forcing us to turn our heads and completely ignore the science. It's scary. Our hands are tied right now.”

Days after the letter was released, the more than 30 staff who had gone public with their names, Landers among them, were summarily placed on administrative leave, locked out of their government email accounts, and ordered not to work and not to enter the FEMA offices.

Truthout spoke to three other signatories who asked to remain anonymous given the continued blowback to the letter. “It was very sudden,” one said. “I was at work and we all received emails that we were placed on administrative leave.” She continued, “We're in a state of purgatory. We can't do our jobs but we're also not free to do anything else. That's very unusual.”

But the suspensions haven't succeeded in stopping the growing chorus of outrage at the administration's gutting of the agency. One signatory talked about the massive brain drain that FEMA is experiencing as employees are fired, quit, or take early retirement — upwards of thirty percent of the permanent full-time staff have been lost since Trump's inauguration — leading to a broad loss of institutional knowledge.

Another, who works on FEMA's mitigation strategies, likened the agency to the hub of a wheel, helping to coordinate disaster preparation, mitigation and response strategies with community groups, residents, and local governments around the country. “Without the hub,” she explained, “your spokes don't fit in; your wheel can't turn.” She said some employees are so down-in-the-dumps because of the cuts that they are getting ill and taking sick days, while others are so demoralized that they are even taking leave without pay, finding it too stressful to work in such a toxic environment.

A third talked about the extraordinary levels of burnout, and the rock-bottom morale plaguing employees. She expressed her fear that the government is so under-prepared as hurricane season gets underway that it will almost certainly cost lives.

There is a sense among FEMA employees that the country is perched on an abyss, and that at some point a major disaster will occur that a denuded agency cannot even begin to address. “The public is currently staring down the barrel of a gun held by the administration as it plays Russian Roulette, with natural disasters serving as the bullet. It may not be the next pull of the trigger — or tomorrow — but the outcome is inevitable unless meaningful, lasting change, as outlined in the Katrina Declaration, is implemented and with haste,” one of the signatories explained. “And this isn't just hyperbole for the sake of it; the danger posed to our collective communities, especially those on the coast, in tornado alley, or in areas prone to fire and flooding, is very real.”

Armoured vehicle hit in Zeitoun neighbourhood as Arab media reports intense clashes in the area

Seven Israeli soldiers were wounded in an explosion targeting an armoured vehicle in Gaza City on Friday night, the Israel Defense Forces have said.

The soldiers were wounded while operating in the Zeitoun neighbourhood, which has been the site of intense Israeli military activity in recent weeks.

Intense clashes in the area on Friday night were reported by Arab media, including Al Jazeera, which said that Hamas had attempted to kidnap some of the Israeli soldiers at the time of the explosion – reports the Israeli military said were false.

Israel declared Gaza City a “dangerous combat zone” on Friday, ending the daily humanitarian pauses that were meant to alleviate hunger there. Gaza City is in the throes of famine, a result of an Israeli blockade that despite the pauses has choked off food and medical supplies into the territory.

The Israeli defence ministry approved plans to occupy and take over Gaza City last week, and despite international and domestic opposition, is pushing ahead with the offensive.

Israel's war in Gaza has killed more than 63,000 people over the last 23 months. Israel launched the war after Hamas-led militants carried out an attack in southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages.

On Thursday, Abu Obeida, a spokesperson for Hamas's military wing, warned that Israel's plans to occupy Gaza City would increase the chances of the group capturing Israeli soldiers and that any Israeli military operation would put the lives of remaining hostages at risk.

Before its offensive, the Israeli military is seeking to forcibly displace the residents of Gaza City to southern Gaza.

Israeli bombardments of the area have intensified in recent days, with the Israeli air force carrying out strikes on tent encampments in Zeitoun and the al-Nasr neighbourhood of Gaza City on Saturday morning, according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa. At least 62 Palestinians had been killed across Gaza in the previous 24 hours, Gaza's health authorities said.

The renewed bombardment has already caused more than 23,000 residents of Gaza City to leave, the UN said on Thursday.

Gaza City hosts nearly half of Gaza's 2 million population and is in the grip of famine. The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross has warned that it would be impossible to keep these residents safe during a mass-displacement scenario.

“It is impossible that a mass evacuation of Gaza City could ever be done in a way that is safe and dignified under the current conditions,” said Mirjana Spoljaric in a statement on Saturday. She added that no other area in the Gaza Strip had the capacity to accommodate such a massive displacement, given the already dire shortages of food and shelter.

Gaza's health ministry reported on Saturday that 10 people had died as a result of starvation or malnutrition in the past 24 hours, including three children. Since the war beganin October 2023, 332 people have starved to death in Gaza – the majority of whom have died since July.

Despite the worsening humanitarian crisis, Israel will soon slow or halt aid into parts of northern Gaza as it begins its Gaza City offensive, an Israeli official told the Associated Press on Saturday. The official said Israel would halt airdropped aid into Gaza City over the coming days and decrease the number of aid trucks that entered northern Gaza, even as the UN says the number of aid trucks entering Gaza is far below what is needed.

The continued Israeli-aid blockade and planned Gaza City operation has drawn a global outcry, including condemnation by six European foreign ministers on Friday. Many EU member states, such as Ireland and Spain, have called for a suspension of the bloc's free trade pact with Israel, but countries including Germany and Hungary are against this measure.

On Saturday, the EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said she was “not optimistic” that the EU would take any measures against Israel because of internal EU divisions. 
 “I'm not very optimistic, and today we are definitely not going to adopt decisions … We are divided about this issue,” Kallas told journalists at a meeting in Denmark for foreign ministers to discuss suspending EU funding to Israeli startups. The proposal would require a voting majority in the bloc, something that the EU does not have.

The Irish foreign minister, Simon Harris, said: “If the EU does not act as a collective now and take sanctions against Israel, whenever will it. What more could it possibly take? Children are starving.”

As the EU debated taking steps against Israel, the US announced it would not allow the president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, to travel to New York next month for the UN general assembly. It also denied and revoked the visas of about 80 Palestinian officials.

Abbas was due to attend a conference where Britain, France, Canada and Australia are expected to recognise a Palestinian state – a step opposed by the US and Israel.
 The step is unprecedented, as the US is obliged to allow access for foreign diplomats to the UN in New York under the 1947 UN headquarters agreement, except in the case of a security threat.

The decision drew international condemnation, with the vice-president of the Palestinian Authority, Hussein al-Sheikh, calling it a clear violation of international law.

EU foreign ministers urged the US to reconsider its decision to bar Palestinian officials from attending the UN general assembly, Kallas said on Saturday. The Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, called the decision “unjust” and expressed support in a phone call to Abbas.

Palestine is a member of the UN and is a permanent observer state, allowing it to participate in the organisation's proceedings.

Lower court to decide if Ralph Leroy Menzies, who killed Maurine Hunsaker in 1986, is competent to face execution

The impending execution of a man by firing squad in Utah was blocked by the state's supreme court on Friday after his attorneys argued he should be spared because he has dementia.

Ralph Leroy Menzies, 67, was set to be executed on 5 September for abducting and killing Utah mother of three Maurine Hunsaker in 1986. When given a choice decades ago, Menzies selected a firing squad as his method of execution. He would have become only the sixth US prisoner executed by firing squad since 1977.

Lawyers for Menzies had launched a new push beginning in early 2024 to free him of his death sentence, arguing that the dementia their client had developed during his 37 years on death row is so severe that he uses a wheelchair, is dependent on oxygen and can't understand why he is facing execution.

The Utah supreme court said Menzies adequately alleged a substantial change of circumstances and raised a significant question on his fitness to be executed, concluding a lower court must re-evaluate his competency.

“We acknowledge that this uncertainty has caused the family of Maurine Hunsaker immense suffering, and it is not our desire to prolong that suffering. But we are bound by the rule of law,” the court said in the order.

A defense attorney for Menzies said his dementia had significantly worsened since he last had a competency evaluation more than a year ago.

“We look forward to presenting our case in the trial court,” attorney Lindsey Layer said.

In a statement to media outlets, Hunsaker's family members said they “are obviously very distraught and disappointed at the supreme court's decision” and asked for privacy.

The Associated Press left phone and email messages on Friday with a spokesperson for the Utah attorney general's office seeking comment on the ruling.

Menzies is not the first person to receive a dementia diagnosis while awaiting execution.

The US supreme court in 2019 blocked the execution of a man with dementia in Alabama, ruling that Vernon Madison was protected against execution under a constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Madison, who killed a police officer in 1985, died in prison in 2020.

That case followed earlier supreme court rulings barring executions of people with severe mental illness. If a defendant cannot understand why they are dying, the supreme court said, then an execution is not carrying out the retribution that society is seeking.

Medical experts brought in by prosecutors during hearings into Menzies's competency said he still has the mental capacity to understand his situation. Experts brought in by the defense said he does not.

Hunsaker was abducted from a store on 23 February 1986. She later called her husband to say she had been robbed and kidnapped but that she would be released by her abductor that night.

Two days later, a hiker found her body at a picnic area about 16 miles (25km) away in Big Cottonwood canyon. Hunsaker had been strangled and her throat slashed.

Utah's last execution played out by lethal injection a year ago. The state hasn't used a firing squad since the 2010 execution of Ronnie Lee Gardner. Earlier this year, South Carolina executed two prisoners by firing squad.

The Lithuanian military has installed obstacles to strengthen security at unused roads at border checkpoints with Russia and Belarus, LRT broadcaster reported on Aug. 30.

The so-called "dragon teeth" — pyramid-shaped concrete anti-tank obstacles — were set up as part of the Baltic Defense Line, a planned string of defenses along the Baltic countries' borders with Russia and Belarus.

Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, three NATO members sharing borders with Russia and its ally Belarus, have increasingly raised alarm over the Russian threat since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

"The installed barriers are only part of a large, integrated picture," Lithuanian military chief Raimundas Vaiksnoras said.

"We are starting from the tactical level — specific obstacles on the border — and later we will combine the entire engineering plan into one conceptual system."

New obstacles have already been installed at the unused Sumskas, Lavoriskes, Raigardas, and Latezeris border crossings with Belarus, as well as at the Romaniskes border checkpoint with Russia's heavily fortified Kaliningrad exclave and other areas.

The Lithuanian military aims to limit the usage of unused roads as part of long-term plans to reduce the threat of ground-based invasion.

Past years saw Lithuania ramp up security measures amid fears of a possible conflict between NATO and Russia. These steps included blocking and fortifying a bridge over the Nieman River linking the country with Kaliningrad.

Vilnius also recently held the Fierce Wolf 2025 military drills in response to the upcoming Zapad 2025 exercises in Belarus, expected to involve 30,000 Russian and Belarusian military personnel.

            Israel is set to halt airdrops over Gaza City and reduce the entry of relief trucks ahead of a major offensive, a source told CNN, as the Red Cross warned that Israeli plans for mass evacuation were “impossible.”
    


            Israel is preparing to fully capture Gaza's biggest city after nearly two years of war, despite warnings the campaign will have disastrous and unbearable consequences for Palestinians in the besieged region.
    


            The Israeli military has carried out heavy bombing and ground attacks on Gaza City in recent days, eyewitnesses and Palestinian authorities say, choking vital services and leaving hundreds of thousands of people crammed into an ever-shrinking area.
    


            On Saturday an Israeli strike on Al-Nasr Street, western Gaza City, killed at least 11 Palestinians including six children, local health officials said.
    


            CNN footage from the courtyard of the hospital showed a row of dead children shrouded in floral blankets. Family members mourn over their small, lifeless bodies, including a toddler wearing a grey onesie with a dinosaur print.
    


            “I don't know what happened,” one man told CNN. “These children are the beloved of God. What was their sin?”
    


            CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment.
    


            On Friday, the military declared Gaza City a “dangerous combat zone” ahead of the planned assault, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says will target what he calls one of Hamas' “remaining strongholds.”
    


            This week Israeli drones circled over several areas in and around the city to drop leaflets, according to Gaza City residents, telling people to evacuate to south of Wadi Gaza, which bisects the Strip.
    


            But the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has denounced the move.
    


            “It is impossible that a mass evacuation of Gaza City could ever be done in a way that is safe and dignified under the current conditions,” ICRC President Mirjana Spoljaric said in a statement, warning that starving, disabled and injured Palestinians were incapable of moving.
    


            “Such an evacuation would trigger a massive population movement that no area in the Gaza Strip can absorb, given the widespread destruction of civilian infrastructure and the extreme shortages of food, water, shelter and medical care,” added Spoljaric.
    


            More than one million people are displaced in the central and western parts of Gaza City alone, a municipality spokesperson said on Saturday, warning that conditions are already “dire.”
    


            “We expect a sharp increase in the number of casualties if the occupation expands its military operation,” said Asem Alnabih. “We are facing a total collapse of service, as the occupation continues to prevent the entry of fuel and the machinery we need.”
    


            A senior UN official warned this week that residents inside Gaza City – who face physical exhaustion, hunger, malnourishment and fatigue – are also under the constant shadow of bombing, weakening their ability to make life or death decisions.
    


            “These people are facing death. Yet, they are now facing the threat of an invasion,” Sam Rose, the acting director of affairs for the UN's agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA) in Gaza told CNN. “They're being terrorized 24 hours a day.”
    


            The Israeli military has announced plans to stop 10-hour “tactical pauses” in hostilities, which began a month ago after severe aid restrictions, siege and bombing wrought deadly starvation in the enclave.
    


            Further aid restrictions will likely only worsen Palestinians' plight. Nearly 700 days of war have brought “man-made” famine to parts of Gaza, the Integrated Food Security and Nutrition Phase Classification reported last week. Israel has rejected the IPC's findings and called on the body to retract its report.
    


New video reveals third strike in deadly ‘double-tap' attack on Gaza hospital



            One young woman displaced with her family in Tal al-Hawa, western Gaza City – including six siblings aged three to 18 – told CNN she has lost 16 kilograms (35 pounds) since the hostilities began.
    


            “The international community watches this genocide and famine, and does nothing,” Raghad Ezzat Hamouda, a Palestinian student, said.
    


            “We are human beings. Our children are dying of hunger in front of the cameras,” added Hamouda. “Your silence is killing us. We need action, not just words.”
    


            In the past 24 hours, a further 10 people died of starvation and malnutrition in Gaza bringing the total to at least 332 Palestinians since October 7, 2023, the health ministry reported on Saturday. Of those who died, 124 were children, the ministry added.
    


            Israeli strikes in Gaza following the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attacks have killed 63,371 Palestinians and injured another 159,835 people, according to the Ministry of Health in the enclave.

Experts say extremists openly talking of how home-built drones will be critical tool in so-called second civil war

Taking their cues from modern warfare, the far-right American terrorist movement sees off-the-shelf or home-built first-person viewer (FPV) drones as a critical weapon in their own future war against the US government, which has American authorities on edge.

And there's ample reasons for those fears: in the open and closed online spaces where far-right extremists congregate, talk is commonplace of how these cheap drones are revolutionizing current wars and will be the critical tools of a so-called second civil war.

“The use of FPV drones in the war between Russia and Ukraine, the use of drones by terrorist groups such as ISIS, and the use of drones by violent criminal groups, such as drug cartels, give examples that domestic extremists may seek to emulate or learn from,” said Joshua Fisher-Birch, a professional analyst who has tracked far-right extremists of every ilk, for close to a decade.

“Groups or individuals could potentially use commercial or home-made drones for reconnaissance purposes or in an offensive capacity.”

Fisher-Birch gave the recent example of a neo-Nazi in Nashville who plotted to bomb a power station with a drone, but was foiled by police. According to him, there is already extremist chatter observing how criminal groups use the FPV as force multipliers against government forces.

“Pretty decent study on how [unmanned aerial systems] are being utilized by cartels, some good insights can be found here,” posted one popular neo-Nazi account on Telegram, attaching a military pamphlet discussing drone warfare to its followers. “If you want to know what a low-intensity conflict, insurgency, or whatever term we're using this decade would look like, just look south.”

Multiple sources tell the Guardian that the FBI has major concerns about the accelerationist neo-Nazi sect on the far right – one calling for an insurgency against the US government – and other ultra-violent actors in the same ideological space, eying the use of FPV drones for domestic attacks.

These same actors have a demonstrated track record of targeting critical infrastructure and planning high casualty events, with the current proliferation and accessibility of the FPV being a boon to those types of plots. More worryingly, evidence has emerged of military trained neo-Nazis with relevant skillsets having pinpointed the FPV as a potential tool.

“I am a drone operator, one of the first in the infantry,” said an anonymous neo-Nazi and Substack writer who is an avowed ex-member of the Atomwaffen Division (AWD), a now defunct and proscribed terrorist organization linked to multiple murders in the US. “The drones the military uses are entirely useless when you look at the reality on the ground in Ukraine. The future is cheap, 3D-printed drones with a [high explosive] round zip tied to it.”

Writing this year on what has become a niche and well-followed account, the same person openly describes his military service, details the future of drone tactics, and prescribes to readers exactly how it is useful to the underground world of neo-Nazis.

“Next, you should have a drone,” he explains. “The FPV drone will be a valuable resource in the coming years, but it requires a certain degree of technical expertise (both in IT & explosives) that most don't have to safely manufacture & use.”

Within the more organized terrorist underbelly of parallel groups to the AWD, such as the Base, long the subject of a nationwide counter-terrorism probe, veterans and active duty soldiers like the writer are coveted and intentionally recruited as operatives. Last year, Rinaldo Nazzaro, founder and leader of the Base who is himself a former Pentagon contractor, offered money to any veteran willing to school his stateside cadres in paramilitarism.

“Leave [bombmaking] to people who won't end up killing themselves,” advises the Substack author and suspected serviceman. “All you need is a very simple drone with a decent camera, this can be used for reconnaissance from above.”

The writer and claimed ex-AWD member, who says he was based in California and only left the US Marine Corps over the summer, never overtly directs readers on how to use a drone in any specific styled attack, but his former group – even after its dissolution – and its members are well known for earmarking electrical transformers as targets.

Brandon Russell, the founder of the AWD, is a veteran who idolizes Timothy McVeigh and was recently found guilty of planning to destroy Maryland substations in an effort to take out the Baltimore power grid.

Fisher-Birch first spotted the Substack and vouched for its credibility. According to him, the writer's alleged background is not only “significant” but “violent white supremacist groups would find his drone experience to be useful”.

“Extreme-right groups that promote violence look for individuals with military training and other professional skills that can be passed on to other members,” he said.

Drone warfare, at the epicenter of modern combat, is now considered critical tradecraft for any military or paramilitary group. Extremists have for years kept an eye on their development, as both a surveillance tool and a weapon. As far back as 2019, the Base and its members discussed how drones could meddle with aircraft, while in 2022 another neo-Nazi group linked to a bank robbery posted videos of their drone doing “reconnaissance” on a “suburban [area of operation]” with images of a subdivision.

How the FBI will effectively police the use of drones remains to be seen, especially as budgetary cuts to the bureau and deprioritization of counter-terrorism investigations on the far-right have become a hallmark of the second Trump administration.

But authorities are well aware of the threat: the Department of Homeland Security issued a warning in one of its threat assessment reports about terrorist groups using drones to “conduct intelligence collection, to drop explosives and other items on US critical infrastructure for disruption purposes”.

For his part, the Substack writer bragged about how his status as a former AWD member was known to the FBI and yet he was still allowed to join the corps.

“There are a number of [neo-Nazis] in the military,” he wrote. “I managed to make it through [military processing] & gain a security clearance despite being known to the FBI as an AWD member.”

“The FBI has no comment,” said an FBI spokesperson in an email to the Guardian.

Novak Djokovic became the oldest man in 34 years to reach the fourth round of the US Open on Friday night, overcoming lower back issues to defeat Cameron Norrie 6-4, 6-7 (4), 6-2, 6-3.
    


            Not since Jimmy Connors' straight-sets victory over Karel Nováček in 1991 has a man older than 38 years and 99 days claimed a third round win at Flushing Meadows.
    


            Djokovic's win also means that he has now overtaken Roger Federer for the most career wins at hard-court grand slams in history, with 192, while the pair are also now tied on 69 for the most grand slam fourth round appearances in the Open Era.
    


            “I'm as young as ever, as strong as ever,” Djokovic joked in his on-court interview after the match.
    


            In truth, Friday's victory was not that simple. Up 5-3 in the first set, the Serbian began experiencing some discomfort in his lower back. A game later, he took a medical timeout.

            “In terms of how I'm feeling, it really goes up and down, to be honest. Yeah, it's frustrating for me, honestly, that I'm not able to feel 100% always like I have for 20-plus years,” the world No. 7 told reporters afterward.
    


            “I don't think there is much more that I could do than what I'm doing now, to be honest. If the body doesn't listen to me when I go deep in the grand slam tournaments, as it was kind of the case last few slams, then that's a hard one to swallow for me, because I know the amount of hours I'm putting in daily to care for my body.”
    


            The 24-time grand slam winner closed out the first set, but Norrie sensed an opportunity and started playing much more aggressively, taking the second set on a tiebreak.
    


            “Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised with Norrie's level,” remarked Djokovic. “I think he was playing really aggressive. I was not used to him playing so close to the line and taking the ball early particularly on the forehand side. You know, credit to him for fighting and playing some really good level.”
    


            But the Serbian, after being broken early in the third, retook control, breaking back instantly and winning five consecutive games, to establish a lead from which Norrie would never recover.
    


            In particular, Djokovic's serve proved too much for the British player. The 38-year-old won 83% of his first-serve points and tied his own personal-best 18 aces at a US Open, calling his performance in that respect “definitely the best so far.”
    


            Djokovic will face off against Jan-Lennard Struff in the fourth round on Sunday.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Aug. 29 denounced Russia's attacks on Germany's infrastructure and attempts to undermine the country's social stability and public opinion

"(Russian President Vladimir) Putin is destabilizing a big part of our country," Merz told French outlet La Chaine Info. "We are already in conflict with Russia."

Western leaders have repeatedly accused Moscow of hybrid operations and sabotage attacks across the European continent, targeting countries supporting Ukraine.

"We all hope that one day the Russians and we will be good neighbors. But today, unfortunately, we are very, very far from that," the German leader continued, adding that Putin wants to "restore the Soviet Union."

Since taking office in May, Merz has ramped up German military support for Ukraine and taken a tougher line towards the Russian leader.

Despite his earlier promises, the chancellor has held off on sending some key military equipment, most famously Taurus missiles.  

Earlier this week, the New York Times and the German outlet WirtschaftsWoche reported growing concerns over suspected Russian drone flights over U.S. arms routes in Germany.

Officials quoted by the outlets presented the flights as espionage of Western arms heading to Ukraine and possible preparations for further sabotage operations in Europe.

Russia is suspected of being behind arson attacks in Poland, Lithuania, and elsewhere, sabotage of underwater infrastructure in the Baltic Sea, and dispatches of incendiary parcels across European countries.

The Ontario government, alongside Toronto City Hall, recently announced planning reforms in Canada's largest city that would legalize larger apartment buildings around most transit stations. 

Ontario Housing Minister Rob Flack and Toronto Mayor Olivia Chow jointly announced the changes on Aug. 15. They alter Toronto's official plan in 120 mass transit station areas, or MTSA, around transit stations or stops. 

Within a 200-metre radius of stations, 30-storey towers are now permitted under certain circumstances, and six-storey apartments are allowed even on side streets. Within approximately 800 metres of a station, four-storey apartments are now permitted. Fourteen more MTSA zones remain under negotiation. 

The announcement “definitely indicates a change of direction in Toronto,” said planning consultant Blair Scorgie. “It increases the baseline for density. But there is uncertainty about how the city will actually implement this.” 

City council needs to pass these changes before construction begins, and they are likely to provoke debate in the lead-up to next October's municipal election. Experts also say other tax and policy shifts are required to revive the city's stalled housing sector.

Toronto and other major cities are facing pressure from higher levels of government to facilitate construction and address the country's housing shortage. Mr. Flack said the new approach would allow for 1.5 million more homes to be built in Toronto over the next 25 years. 

Toronto must still answer to the federal government for its commitments to planning reform. The city could forfeit about $30-million in federal funding if it does not legalize six-unit apartments across the entire city. The sixplex change was one of several requirements Ottawa set for Toronto in exchange for funding from its Housing Accelerator Fund. Last week, federal Housing and Infrastructure Minister Gregor Robertson met with Ms. Chow; the two declined to comment on that dispute.

No sign of housing deal after Housing Minister meets with Toronto mayor

The MTSA news does, however, resolve a standoff between the city and the province. In 2019, the Ford government defined 180 mass transit station areas in Toronto, requiring the city to set certain density targets to take advantage of that transit infrastructure. Toronto then created new zoning for those areas, but the city's response was widely criticized as inadequate. The provincial government did not sign off on most of Toronto's proposals, leaving the city in limbo.

Jason Thorne, Toronto's chief planner, said the new density reforms were negotiated by city and provincial staff. Queen's Park was “looking for a more ambitious approach to planning around the station areas,” he said. “We welcome the decision. We think these densities are appropriate.” 

For the new Toronto policies to be fully implemented, the city will need to draw detailed maps of the transit station areas, and get new zoning approved by council. “We are working very quickly to address that,” Mr. Thorne said. “Normally this would take a year or more for each area, so we are very conscious of the timeline.” 

Mr. Thorne's department aims to complete the zoning work by next spring. 

“It's not a done deal,” said Alex Beheshti, a senior research associate with the Missing Middle Initiative at the University of Ottawa. “Chow will need to shepherd this through city council, and she doesn't have a great record of that.” 

Mr. Beheshti referred to a June vote where city council compromised by allowing sixplex apartments in some wards, but not the whole city, and Ms. Chow didn't speak during the debate. “She's not going to be able to remain silent on this.” 

The new changes provide some good news for progressives: The city's “inclusionary zoning” comes into effect in most MTSA areas. Under this policy, which has been championed by left-leaning councillors and Ms. Chow, condo buildings of 100 or more units will need to ensure five per cent of them are affordable rentals.

Toronto wrangles with a simple question: What is a multiplex?

However, for private development projects already in the works, this presents a new, potentially prohibitive cost. 

“While enabling the city's use of inclusionary zoning is overdue as a tool to deliver meaningful affordable housing, the timing of the Minister's decision will delay and potentially negatively impact certain projects,” said lawyer David Bronskill, a partner at Goodmans LLP who often represents private developers in negotiations with the city. 

“Unfortunately, inclusionary zoning only works if development projects actually proceed to construction.”

Inclusionary zoning policies exclude purpose-built rental buildings and all buildings with fewer than 100 units. Mr. Scorgie suggested this could create an incentive for smaller development projects and smaller builders. 

For these kinds of projects to work, though, he said governments “will need to take a hard look at other kinds of reform.” That could include city regulations about the size and shape of structures, and building codes that forbid European-style buildings with one set of exit stairs.

Marsha Lederman: Toronto the Grind: Making your way around has never been such a slog

The policy differences between the province and the city reflect larger tensions within planning in Ontario. Since 2005, the province has focused on new growth as “intensification” within cities. Municipal governments must then implement zoning – regulations for each specific site – that brings that policy to ground level. 

In Toronto and other high-growth cities, zoning has generally not allowed apartment buildings or large commercial buildings by default. Instead, developers and builders typically negotiate site-by-site to amend city regulations. This often involves an appeal to the Ontario Land Tribunal.

These new reforms could make for a more straightforward process in some cases, Mr. Beheshti said. Previously, areas near transit “were identified for greater density in provincial policies, but the specifics weren't there,” he explained. For builders, “there was a yes at the end of the tunnel, but you had to run a gauntlet of ‘no' to get there.” For some properties, Mr. Beheshti said that will now become less arduous.

However, he pointed out: “Next year is an election year, and the mayor is in a precarious position. How things shake down at city council could be very different.”

U.S. President Donald Trump suggested that Chinese peacekeepers could monitor a neutral zone along the front line in Ukraine as part of a potential peace settlement, the Financial Times reported on Aug. 29, citing four undisclosed sources.

The idea has been previously proposed by Russia but rejected by Ukraine and its European allies due to China's close relationship with Moscow amid the full-scale war.

The Trump administration has not publicly commented on the possibility of Chinese peacekeepers in Ukraine. In comments for the Financial Times, a senior U.S. administration official denied the claims as "false," saying there had been "no discussion on Chinese peacekeepers."

The alleged proposal came amid Trump's push to broker an end to the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine, ongoing for three and a half years.

Fearing a renewed Russian aggression in case of a peace deal, President Volodymyr Zelensky has stressed the necessity of security guarantees as part of a potential agreement.

The European-led coalition of the willing proposed the deployment of a multinational "reassurance force" in post-war Ukraine as a component of such guarantees.

Russia has rejected the deployment of peacekeepers from NATO countries, with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov saying such a move would amount to "foreign military intervention."

At the same time, Moscow has previously proposed that China could provide security guarantees, including through a peacekeeper deployment, though the Chinese Foreign Ministry denied in March reported plans to participate in a peacekeeping mission.

While claiming to be neutral in the war and calling for a peaceful resolution, Beijing has been a key ally to Moscow, helping it avoid Western sanctions and becoming the leading source of dual-use goods.

Ukraine has also accused China of providing arms and defense components to Russia, an accusation Beijing denied.

Russian President Vladimir Putin is set to travel to China this weekend to meet his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov described the upcoming visit as "absolutely unprecedented."

PARIS, August 30. /TASS/. France is set to table new proposals for sanctions against Russia during an informal gathering of EU foreign ministers in Copenhagen, Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told reporters ahead of the meeting.

"I will present proposals developed by France so that we can deplete the resources that [Russia] is investing in this war and stop the Russian war machine by targeting the energy sector, the financial sector, and perhaps also certain civilian segments that continue to indirectly support Russia's military efforts," Barrot said.

EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas confirmed that sanctions expansion would be on the agenda, though she emphasized that no binding decisions can be made at this stage.

The 19th sanctions package

The European Commission is preparing its 19th package of measures, which Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has promised to adopt in September. According to Politico, the bloc has largely exhausted its most effective levers of economic pressure on Moscow, meaning few surprises are expected. The new package will reportedly include tighter restrictions on Russia's energy and banking sectors, along with the blacklisting of additional individuals and entities.

Von der Leyen also pledged "new steps" on the handling of frozen Russian assets. The Commission later clarified that this would not involve outright expropriation, but rather the further confiscation of income generated by reinvestment of the €210 billion in Russian sovereign assets blocked within the EU.

Brussels is also weighing the use of secondary sanctions - penalties aimed at countries and companies outside the EU that continue trading with Russia and helping it circumvent restrictions.

MOSCOW, August 30. /TASS/. Russian President Vladimir Putin highly praised the level of Russian-Chinese relations across various spheres, from international politics to cinema and sports. In a written interview with the Xinhua news agency, the Russian leader discussed the agenda of his upcoming visit to China and shared his vision of what the two countries can offer each other and the entire world. The text of the interview was published on the Kremlin's website one day before the start of the four-day visit.

"I greatly look forward to visiting the city of Tianjin, which will host the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit under China's presidency. We expect that the summit will give the Organisation powerful new momentum, strengthen its capacity to respond to contemporary challenges and threats, and enhance solidarity across our shared Eurasian space. All this will help shape a fairer multipolar world order," Putin stated.

"As for the Russian-Chinese talks, these will take place in Beijing <...> on all aspects of our bilateral agenda, <...> on pressing regional and international issues," Putin added, noting that "the Russia-China strategic partnership acts as a stabilizing force."

Putin highlighted the upcoming commemorative events in the Chinese capital marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II.

"President Xi Jinping treats his country's history with utmost respect; I know this from personal communication with him. He is a true leader of a great world power, a man of strong will, endowed with strategic vision and a global outlook, and unwavering in his commitment to national interests. It is of exceptional importance for China that such a person stands at the helm at this challenging, pivotal moment in international affairs," Putin stressed.

"The peoples of the Soviet Union and China bore the brunt of the fighting and suffered the heaviest losses" in WWII, Putin emphasized.

"In Russia, we will never forget that China's heroic resistance was one of the crucial factors that prevented Japan from stabbing the Soviet Union in the back during the darkest months of 1941-1942. This enabled the Red Army to concentrate its efforts on crushing Nazism and liberating Europe," Putin stated.

"We are grateful to China for its careful preservation of memorials to Red Army soldiers who gave their lives in battles for the liberation of China," Putin said.

"Such a sincere and responsible attitude towards the past stands in stark contrast to the situation in some European countries, where monuments and graves of Soviet liberators are desecrated in a barbaric manner or destroyed, and inconvenient historical facts are erased. We see that in certain Western states the results of the Second World War are de facto revised, and the verdicts of the Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals are openly disregarded," Putin stressed.

"Japanese militarism is being revived under the pretext of imaginary Russian or Chinese threats, while in Europe, including Germany, steps are being taken towards the re-militarisation of the continent, with little regard for historical parallels," he added.

"In terms of trade volume, <> transactions between Russia and China are carried out in rubles and yuan, with the dollar or euro share reduced to a statistical discrepancy," Putin emphasized.

"Russia firmly retains its position as a leading exporter of oil and gas to China. Since the Power of Siberia pipeline began its operation in 2019, cumulative deliveries of natural gas have already exceeded 100 billion cubic metres. In 2027, we plan to launch another major gas route, the so-called Far Eastern Route," he specified.

"We continue our joint efforts to reduce bilateral trade barriers. In recent years, the export of pork and beef to China has been launched," Putin noted, adding that "Russia is one of the world's principal markets for Chinese car exports."

"At the same time, production is being localised in Russia not only for Chinese cars but also for household appliances. <...> We also have large-scale plans in the construction materials industry," he said.

"I would particularly highlight the successful organisation of the Russia and China Years of Culture. <...> President Xi and I agreed that 2026-2027 will be designated as the Russia-China Years of Education," Putin noted.

"The Russian side initiated the Intervision International Song Contest, scheduled for September 20 this year, and we are pleased that our Chinese partners have shown keen interest in this project," he added.

"We are grateful to our Chinese partners for their active participation in international sporting events hosted by Russia. <...> We firmly believe that sport should remain free from any politicisation," Putin affirmed.

"We anticipate the release of many new Russian-Chinese films in the near future: films that will promote sound moral principles and traditional spiritual and ethical values, while presenting truthful accounts of important historical events. To this end, we have also launched a new initiative, the Open Eurasian Film Award, a unique platform for cinema, free from bias or political intrigue," Putin noted.

"Tourism is another important sphere I would like to note. The figures here are encouraging: by the end of 2024, mutual tourist flows had increased 2.5 times, reaching 2.8 million people," he added.

"Russia and China support reform of the UN so that it fully restores its authority and reflects modern realities. In particular, we advocate for making the Security Council more democratic by including states from Asia, Africa, and Latin America," Putin emphasized.

"Alongside our Chinese partners, we support the reform of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank," he added.

"It is essential to end the use of finance as an instrument of neo-colonialism, which runs counter to the interests of the Global Majority. On the contrary, we seek progress for the benefit of all humanity," the Russian leader stressed.

Putin also noted close cooperation between Moscow and Beijing within the G20, BRICS and APEC.

US Vice President J.D. Vance has accused Politico of running a “foreign influence operation” against special envoy Steve Witkoff, blasting the outlet's reporting as “journalistic malpractice” for relying on anonymous officials while excluding on-the-record statements from senior figures who defended him.

The article, published on Friday by Politico correspondent Felicia Schwartz with the headline “‘His inexperience shines through': Steve Witkoff struggles to manage Russia as Trump peace envoy,” cited 13 anonymous American and foreign officials who claimed that Witkoff lacks diplomatic skills and has caused confusion in ongoing negotiations with Moscow.

“This story from Politico is journalistic malpractice. But it's more than that: it's a foreign influence operation meant to hurt the administration and one of our most effective members,” Vance wrote on X.

The only people Politico mentioned by name were those actually defending Witkoff. Vance said Schwartz omitted his own full statement as well as quotes from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, former White House adviser Jared Kushner, and British diplomat Jonathan Powell.

“The person who wrote this garbage… They have an agenda to blow up the president's efforts to make peace, and they saw her as a useful vessel to launder garbage into the conversation, truth be damned,” Vance added.

Powell, the UK's former chief negotiator in Northern Ireland, was quoted briefly as saying Witkoff “opened doors no one else could.” However, in his full remarks, he dismissed the “snobbery in diplomacy” and explained at length why Witkoff is “exactly the kind” of independent negotiator who succeeds where others fail.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also accused Politico of deliberately cherry-picking quotes to fit a narrative. Deputy Chief of Staff James Blair went further, calling the article “a foreign influence operation run through a German-controlled online media outlet.”

Witkoff has led the Trump administration's back-channel talks with Russia and held multiple meetings with President Vladimir Putin and other top officials as part of Washington's efforts to negotiate an end to the Ukraine conflict.

Politico also claimed, citing another anonymous “person familiar,” that the Russians in touch with Witkoff are “frustrated” by his supposed “inability to properly convey Putin's messages and red lines to Trump.”

Russian officials, however, have spoken warmly of him, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov previously saying “we are always glad to see Mr. Witkoff in Moscow,” and calling the meetings “important, meaningful, and very useful.”

NEW YORK (AP) — For the first time at this U.S. Open, Coco Gauff didn't double-fault in her first service game. And for the first time, she didn't get broken to begin things, either.

With her work-in-progress serve looking the best it has so far in this trip to Flushing Meadows, the No. 3-seeded Gauff turned in by far her most solid — and stress-free — performance Saturday, defeating No. 28 Magdalena Frech of Poland 6-3, 6-1 to reach the fourth round of a tournament she won in 2023.

“It's been like an emotional week … but I think I needed those tough moments to move forward,” said Gauff, who will face four-time major champion Naomi Osaka on Monday for a berth in the quarterfinals. “I was putting too much pressure on myself.”

Osaka, who won titles in New York in 2018 and 2020, moved into the fourth round — a stage she last got to at any major at the 2021 Australian Open — with a 6-0, 4-6, 6-3 victory over No. 15 Daria Kasatkina.

Back in 2019, during Gauff's first U.S. Open, when she was just 15, she lost to reigning champion Osaka in the third round. Afterward, Osaka consoled a teary Gauff and encouraged her to address the crowd.

After two difficult wins under the lights at night in Arthur Ashe Stadium, Gauff started Saturday's schedule with an 11:30 a.m. match. With shade covering nearly half of the blue court on a cloudless morning, there were none of the tears or struggles that marked her earlier appearances during the week.




“It was kind of hard to see the ball,” Gauff said, “but overall, I'm happy with the way I played.”

In both of her earlier outings, against Ajla Tomljanovic on Tuesday and Donna Vekic on Thursday, Gauff fell behind 2-0. Against Frech, the 21-year-old from Florida went up 3-0, before running into a hint of trouble: Gauff slapped a second serve into the net to double-fault and get broken, getting Frech within 3-2, and soon it was 3-all after 26 minutes.

So, essentially, they were starting over, and the next game was pivotal. Gauff led 40-love but wound up at 40-30 after shanking a forehand that landed 10 feet out.

Thousands of fans started yelling encouragement and clapping to try to help Gauff. She heard, looked around and clutched a ball for her next serve, vigorously shaking it. Gauff stepped to the baseline and delivered a 105 mph first serve that drew an errant return. Upon watching the ball land out, she leaned forward, clenched her left fist and screamed “Come on!”

That began a set-closing three-game run and Gauff was on her way. Her serve has become a major issue, which is why she brought aboard a biomechanics expert, Gavin MacMillan, who helped Aryna Sabalenka settle her serving yips and rise to No. 1 in the WTA rankings with three major championships, including in New York a year ago.

Gauff's title defense at the U.S. Open in 2024 ended with a fourth-round loss in which she had 19 double-faults. She has been the worst player on the women's tour in that category this season and reached a low point with 23 in a victory at Montreal last month, and 14 more in her next match.

In the wins against Tomljanovic and Vekic, Gauff totaled 18 double-faults and lost 10 of the games she served. What got her through those was the rest of her game: returning, defending and a clear superiority once the ball was in play.

Those last three areas were again strengths for Gauff. She broke Frech five times and was terrific whenever their baseline exchanges lasted more than four shots, taking 35 of those 51 points. She also made only 18 unforced errors and claimed the point on 10 of her 11 times at the net.

All eyes were on Gauff's serve, of course, and that showed quite an improvement on Saturday: four double-faults and just the one break. She put in 76% of her first serves while averaging 98 mph, with a high of 113 mph.

WASHINGTON (AP) — It's a scene that has played out on the streets of Washington and Los Angeles since President Donald Trump declared a crime emergency in the nation's capital and ramped up deportations nationwide: Federal agents, some in masks, grabbing someone off the street, bundling the person into a car and driving away, ignoring questions from bystanders.

In an executive order signed this month, Trump said the District of Columbia government's “failure to maintain public order and safety has had a dire impact on the Federal Government's ability to operate” and that it was his duty as president to use federal agents to restore order. He has threatened to expand those operations — law enforcement duties traditionally reserved for local police — to other cities.

Urban leaders, police officials and civil rights advocates say federal agents are not the best equipped for this type of policing. They also are concerned the strategy will erode the delicate relationship that local police have with the communities they serve.

Here are some key things to know about the differences in how federal authorities and local police operate:




Federal agents have not historically played much of a role in everyday policing. The job of federal marshal was created in 1789, but the agency's numbers are small and largely focused on carrying out the work of federal courts. Other U.S. investigative agencies have mostly focused on major interstate crimes and national security matters.

Federal agents “are usually doing major investigations. They're not navigating day-to-day contact with the public the way that police do,” said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has more traditionally done nationwide work tracking down immigrants who are in the United States illegally but has ramped up operations since Trump took office in January.

After protests over the deaths of Black men at the hands of police in recent years, many cities made policy changes to enhance accountability and transparency.

Most large police departments, for example, require officers to wear cameras on patrol. Many agencies release the footage upon request or under their state public records law. Federal agencies have not embraced such change, despite some tentative steps to keep pace with their local counterparts.

In 2022, Democratic President Joe Biden issued an executive order requiring federal law enforcement agencies to adopt body-camera policies for officers who are on patrol, making arrests and or conducting searches. Trump rescinded that directive, and agencies such as the Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Border Patrol have ended their usage.

Body-worn cameras “have been good for everybody,” said Lauren Bonds, executive director of the National Police Accountability Project. Bonds said such policies protect officers from meritless citizen complaints and make it easier for the public to get justice if they have been wronged. “Across the board, I would say it's an equally beneficial tool for police and for the public,” she said.

Washington's mayor, Democrat Muriel Bowser, has questioned why so many of the federal officers flooding the city's streets are covering their faces.

“Why do they need masks?” Bowser asked. “They are federal officials. They're paid by the taxpayers. They should be doing their jobs in a way that's lawful and constitutional.”

Civil rights advocates have complained that such tactics erode trust between communities and law enforcement and make holding individual officers to account for abuses more difficult. Administration officials say masks are needed to protect federal agents.

Troy Edgar, deputy DHS secretary, wrote in an op-ed for Fox News that mask-wearing protects federal law enforcement officers from doxing and harassment. ICE has seen a sharp rise in assaults, with officials targeted on a “near weekly basis,” he wrote.

He said DHS agents clearly identify themselves during arrests by stating their names, showing badges and wearing identifiers on their gear. But photos and videos reviewed by The Associated Press do not show agents always wearing clear badges, tags or other identifiers during encounters with the public.

Masks were once largely forbidden on the federal level unless an agent was working undercover, said Michael Bouchard, a former assistant director at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco Firearms and Explosives who retired in 2007. Being clearly identifiable builds trust and allows people to report any issues they might have with a particular officer, Bouchard said.

“If you're doing the right thing,” he said, “if you're acting within the law, what do you have to hide from?”

Most local arrest reports are a matter of public record. Some local agencies even disclose such information to citizens in email groups or on social media websites.

Getting access to basic arrest details from the federal government has proved far harder. Administration officials have been releasing daily arrest totals and some of the charges that people are facing, but information on which agency made which arrests and who is facing what charges has been difficult to find.

Those seeking details about federal arrests are frequently directed to file a request under the Freedom of Information Act. Most agencies have large backlogs of such requests.

“When the agencies doing the policing have backlogs that measure in years or sometimes decades, FOlA is completely ineffective at getting policing records in any kind of useful time frame,” said Kel McClanahan, an attorney at the firm National Security Counselors who frequently works on public information issues.

Once a loved one is arrested, especially by immigration authorities, families can face a grueling task of trying to find them.

In June, for example, Rosa Soto scrambled to find where a longtime family friend, Martin Guzman, was taken after he was detained by immigration authorities at a Home Depot in Chino, California. It took her days to track him down.

“It feels like the systems you're supposed to be able to trust and the due process you're supposed to be able to trust in is no longer existent,” Soto said. “I can't imagine for someone who knows very little about our justice system to truly be able to navigate it.”

Civic leaders said they fear the federal crackdown could erode uneven progress police have made in building trust with the communities they serve.

“We are getting some violent people off the streets -- but in the long run, at what cost?” Jaron Hickman, a senior police commander in Washington, said at a public forum Tuesday.

Norm Nixon, 62, an associate minister at Union Temple Baptist Church in Washington's historically Black Anacostia neighborhood, said federal operations were changing the way residents felt about the city's police force.

“Now, with these federal guys coming in, people just see them all as law enforcement,” Nixon said. “Some of the young people I talk to feel like the local police officers are traitors now, that they are really against us and out to get us.”

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia launched a large aerial attack on southern Ukraine, officials said Saturday, two days after a rare airstrike on central Kyiv killed 23 and damaged European Union diplomatic offices as U.S.-led efforts to end the three-year war staggered.

Among other locations hit, the assault overnight into Saturday struck a five-story residential building, killing at least one civilian and wounding 28 people, including children, in the Zaporizhzhia region, Gov. Ivan Fedorov reported.

Russia launched 537 strike drones and decoys, as well as 45 missiles, according to Ukraine's air force. Ukrainian forces shot down or neutralized 510 drones and decoys and 38 missiles, it said. 

The Kremlin on Thursday said Russia remained interested in continuing peace talks, despite the air attack on Kyiv that was one of the largest and deadliest since Moscow's full-scale invasion in 2022.

The attacks came less than two weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump met Russia's Vladimir Putin for a summit in Alaska, a meeting that marked the end of Putin's diplomatic isolation in the West but yielded few details on how the war might end. 

Thursday's strike was one of the few times Russian drones and missiles have penetrated the heart of the Ukrainian capital. Children were among the dead, and search and rescue efforts continued for hours to pull people from the rubble.

Hours after the attack, the United States approved an $825 million arms sale to Ukraine that will include extended-range missiles and related equipment to boost its defensive capabilities. Washington's efforts to broker peace between Ukraine and Russia appear to have stalled. 

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday expressed frustration with what he called Russia's lack of constructive engagement.

Ukraine has accepted a U.S. proposal for a ceasefire and a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy, but Moscow has raised objections. Trump said Friday he expects to decide on next steps in two weeks if direct talks aren't scheduled between the two leaders.

Meanwhile, Ukraine's European allies have accused Putin of dragging his feet in peace efforts and avoiding serious negotiations while Russian troops move deeper into the country.

Moscow's forces are waging a “nonstop” offensive along almost the whole 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line in Ukraine, and have the “strategic initiative,” the chief of Russia's general staff said Saturday. Valery Gerasimov's address to his deputies was published by Russia's Defense Ministry.

Since March, Moscow has taken more than 3,500 square kilometers (1,351 square miles) of Ukrainian territory, and captured 149 settlements, Gerasimov said. It was not immediately possible to verify the situation on the battlefield. 

Russian forces this month broke into Ukraine's southeastern Dnipropetrovsk region, a Ukrainian military official said Wednesday, pressing into an eighth Ukrainian province in a possible bid to strengthen the Kremlin's negotiating hand. Gerasimov on Saturday said Moscow's troops have so far taken seven settlements in Dnipropetrovsk. 

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU was advancing toward seizing frozen Russian assets to hand to Ukraine.

“It's clear that the predator has to pay for what he did,” she said, referring to Putin.

Von der Leyen spoke Saturday in Estonia in a joint news conference with Prime Minister Kristen Michal, while on a four-day tour tour of European states bordering Russia or its ally Belarus.

Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, said that “everyone agrees that Russia should pay for the damages, not our taxpayers,” but that there was disagreement within the EU about confiscating the assets.

Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Prévot said his government opposed the move, as it “would trigger a system financial instability, and also erodes trusts in the euro.” He said the assets should remain frozen until Russia pays Ukraine reparations. 

Kallas and Prévot spoke during a summit of EU foreign and defense ministers in Copenhagen. Over two days on Friday and Saturday, EU officials discussed sanctions on Russia, ramping up defense supplies to Kyiv, postwar security guarantees and Ukraine's prospects for joining the 27-nation bloc. 

Separately, Ukraine has continued to strike oil refineries inside Russia that it says have supplied Moscow's war effort, the Ukrainian general staff reported Saturday. It said two facilities were hit overnight: in the Krasnodar region near occupied Crimea, and the Samara region farther northeast. 

Falling drone debris sparked a fire at a refinery in the city of Krasnodar, regional Russian authorities confirmed Saturday. They said the blaze was extinguished, damaging one of the facility's processing units but causing no casualties. The Krasnodar refinery produces approximately 3 million tons per year of petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel. 

A separate drone strike caused a fire at the Syzran Oil Refinery in the Samara province, according to the Ukrainian general staff. 

Gas stations have run dry in some regions of Russia after Ukrainian drones struck oil infrastructure in recent weeks, with motorists waiting in long lines and officials resorting to rationing or cutting off sales altogether. To try to ease the shortage, Russia has paused gasoline exports, with officials Wednesday declaring a full ban until Sept. 30 and a partial ban affecting traders and intermediaries until Oct. 31. 

Analysts expect the gasoline crisis to ease by late September as demand subsides and the annual summer maintenance for many refineries is finished. Still, the shortages have highlighted a vulnerability on the homefront that Ukraine could exploit further as drone warfare evolves. 

In a separate development, Ukraine's former parliament speaker and a prominent pro-Western politician was shot dead in the city of Lviv on Saturday, according to statements by Zelenskyy and local authorities.

Little is known so far about the perpetrator, or why Andriy Parubiy was targeted. Zelenskyy decried Parubiy's “terrible murder,” and vowed to open an investigation.

Parubiy, 54, was a lawmaker from the Lviv region who participated in Ukraine's Orange Revolution in 2004 and led self-defense volunteer units during the Maidan protests of 2014, which forced pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych from office. He was parliament speaker from 2016 to 2019.

WASHINGTON (AP) — In an afternoon's walk through ground zero of Americana — the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History — objects around every corner invite one question: What could possibly be more American than this?

There's the enormous Star-Spangled Banner in all its timeworn glory, Dorothy's ruby slippers from “The Wizard of Oz” and totems of achievement throughout.

There are also testaments to pain and cruelty. What could be more American than a reckoning with the nation's sins, as illustrated by shackles representing slavery and photos of Japanese Americans confined to detention camps in World War II? 

In myriad ways, the museum explores “the complexity of our past,” in accord with its mission statement. President Donald Trump wants a simpler tale told. He wants this and the other Smithsonian museums to mirror American pride, power and accomplishment without all the darkness, and he threatens to hold back money if they don't get with that program.

On social media, Trump complained that at the Smithsonian museums, which are free to visit and get most of their money from the government, “everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was, and how unaccomplished the downtrodden have been — Nothing about Success, nothing about Brightness, nothing about the Future.”




In fact, the history museum reflects bountiful successes, whether on the battlefield, from the kitchens and factories of food pioneers, on the musical stage, in the movies or on other fronts of creativity and industriousness. The American Enterprise exhibit, for one, has a wall filled with the stories of successful Americans.

On this wandering tour you can see navigational implements used by Blackbeard, the terrifying pirate, from his early 1700s raids on the Atlantic coast. You see the hat Abraham Lincoln wore to Ford's Theatre the night of his assassination, George Washington's ceremonial uniform, Warren Harding's fine red silk pajamas from the early 1900s, the first car to travel across the country, and a $100,000 bill.

You can see the original light bulbs of the American genius, Thomas Edison. A much earlier genius, the founding father Benjamin Franklin, is presented both as a gifted inventor and a slave owner who publicly came to denounce slavery yet never freed his own.

Those nuances and ambiguities may not be long for this world. Still on display at the history museum are artifacts and documents of American ingenuity, subjugation, generosity, racism, grit, dishonor, verve, playfulness, corruption, heroism, and cultural appropriation. 

Like most museums, the focus is not on the future.

Even so, there is plenty to provoke the Republican president. 

In the “Great Debate” of an American democracy exhibition, a wall is emblazoned with large words such as “Privilege” and “Slavery.” The museum presents fulsome tributes to the contributions of immigrants and narratives about the racist landscape that many encountered. 

Exhibits address “food justice,” the exploitation of Filipinos after the United States annexed their land and the network of oppressive Native American boarding schools from which Jim Thorpe emerged and became one of the greatest athletes of all time.

Hawaii's last sovereign before its annexation by the U..S. in the 1890s, Queen Lili‘uokalani, is quoted on a banner as asking: “Is the AMERICAN REPUBLIC of STATES to DEGENERATE and become a COLONIZER?”

A ukulele on display was made around 1890 by a sugar laborer who worked on the kingdom's American plantations before a U.S.-backed coup overthrew the monarchy. Museum visitors are told the new instrument was held up by the monarchs as a symbol of anti-colonial independence.

“Ukuleles are both a product of U.S. imperialism and a potent symbol of Native Hawaiian resistance,” says the accompanying text.

At the Greek-godlike statue of George Washington, the text hints at his complexities and stops short of the total reverence that totalitarian leaders get.

Noting that “modern scholarship focuses on the fallible man rather than the marble hero,” the text says Washington's image “is still used for inspiration, patriotism and commercial gain” and that “he continues to hold a place for many as a symbolic ‘father' of the country.”

On this visit, conservators behind a big window are seen sweeping tiny brushes on ancient wooden pieces. Their patriotic work proceeds at a snail's pace.

The team is restoring the gunboat Philadelphia, part of a small fleet that engaged the British navy at the Battle of Valcour Island in Lake Champlain in 1776, delaying Britain's effort to cut off the New England colonies and buying time for the Continental Army to prepare for its decisive victory at Saratoga.

The commander of the gunboats in the Valcour battle later became America's greatest traitor, Benedict Arnold. The British damaged the Philadelphia so badly it sank an hour after the battle, then lay underwater for 160 years. It's being restored for next year's celebrations of America's 250th year. 

“The Philadelphia is a symbol of how citizens of a newly formed nation came together, despite overwhelming odds against their success,” said Jennifer Jones, the project's director. “This boat's fragile condition is symbolic of our democracy; it requires the nation's attention and vigilance to preserve it for future generations.”

Democracy's fragility is considered in a section of the museum about the limits of presidential power. That's where references to Trump's two impeachments were removed in July for updating, and were restored this month.

“On December 18, 2019, the House impeached Donald Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress,” one label now states. “On January 13, 2021, Donald Trump became the first president to be impeached twice,” says another. “The charge was incitement of insurrection based on his challenge of the 2020 election results and on his speech on January 6.” His Senate acquittals are duly noted.

It's a just-the-facts take on a matter that has driven the country so deeply apart. The history museum doesn't offer answers for that predicament. Instead, it asks questions throughout its halls on the fundamentals of Americanism.

“How should Americans remember their Revolution and the founding of the nation?”

“What does patriotism look like?”

“How diverse should the citizenry be?”

“Do we need to share a common national story?”

"I think it's the first time that someone proposed during my match," Sabalenka said. "It was a very sweet moment, but I was just trying not to start smiling, because it's very cute and I believe they're super happy right now."

Fans inside the stadium began to c heer as they saw the man drop to one knee with the ring in his hands. He egged on the crowd to encourage them to get louder.

The woman said, "Yes."

"I was just trying to keep focusing on my game, and it was great moment," Sabalenka said. "And as I said on court, I wish them a happy marriage."

Sabalenka defeated Fernandez in straight sets, 6-3, 7-6 (2). She will play against Cristina Bucşa in the round of 16.

African media quizzed FIFA president Gianni Infantino on Saturday if people from the continent will be safe and welcome in the United States at the 2026 World Cup.

Soccer fans from Africa “are a little bit jittery” about current events in the U.S., Infantino was told at a news conference in Kenya which urged him to ensure African visitors to the tournament do not feel “outcast ... second-class citizens.”

The FIFA leader was reminded he met yet again last week with U.S. President Donald Trump, who now has a gold World Cup trophy sitting in a glass case on his desk in the White House.

“We are going to play it in a country where some of us do not feel welcome,” said a reporter from South Africa, the home country of FIFA vice president Patrice Motsepe who sat beside Infantino at a luxury hotel in Nairobi.

Motsepe is the brother-in-law of South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa, who had a tense visit to the White House in May when Trump repeated his administration's baseless claims of white farmers being systematic killed in the country.




At least nine African nations will be in the 48-team lineup of the World Cup being played June 11 to July 19 in 11 U.S. cities plus three in Mexico and two in Canada. Egypt, Morocco and South Africa are likely to qualify in October as current leaders of qualifying groups.

A 10th African team could advance in inter-continental playoffs scheduled after the tournament draw, which Trump and Infantino announced in the Oval Office last week will be held in Washington D.C. at the Kennedy Center on Dec. 5.

“Everyone will be welcome in North America next year for the World Cup,” said Infantino, whose long-standing ties to Trump got him a seat in the Capitol Rotunda for the president's inauguration in January.

“I think it's important to clarify this, there is a lot of misconception out there,” the FIFA leader told a roomful of African media.

Tickets for the 104 World Cup games go on sale Sept. 10 amid long-standing concerns about fans getting visas to enter the U.S. which has travel bans and watch lists for dozens of countries. Iran already qualified and will play at least three games at the World Cup.

“I think the onus is on you,” the South African reporter told Infantino and Motsepe, “to make sure that Africa and all the other people of the world do not feel outcast, do not feel like they are being made second-class citizens in a world where equality should prevail.” The reporter's identity was not immediately clear — the news conference was carried on the Confederation of African Football's YouTube channel — but he said he's from South Africa.

Infantino was told earlier by a reporter: “African football fans are a little bit jittery about what is happening in the U.S. in regards to the expansion of people who are in the U.S.”

Motsepe, a billionaire businessman who has led Africa's soccer body since 2021, insisted discreet work with U.S. authorities had secured commitments to make the World Cup run smoothly.

“We are confident that we will fulfill whatever requirements they may have and there will be sufficient access to African fans in the World Cup next year,” Motsepe said.

Announcing travel bans in June, the Trump administration promised exemptions for teams and officials coming to the soccer tournament — and the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics — though the prospects for fans are less clear.

Infantino claimed fans came from 164 countries to the month-long Club World Cup hosted in 11 U.S. cities in June and July “without of course any problems” with visas.

“The world needs occasions of unity,” said Infantino, who was told by Trump in the White House last week FIFA would not be able to organize World Cup games in L.A. next year had the president not sent troops into the city recently. Eight games are scheduled at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, including the U.S. team's opener June 12.

“Be positive,” Infantino said in Kenya, “you will see there will be a great, great celebration of the greatest FIFA World Cup ever.”

TILBURG, Netherlands (AP) — The southern Dutch city of Tilburg is seeing more color than usual this weekend, as thousands of redheads from all over the world gather in the Netherlands for a once-a-year festival to celebrate their flaming locks.

The 2025 edition of the Redhead Days festival includes music, food trucks and workshops tailored to particular needs of redheads, from makeup explainers to skin cancer prevention. 

Organizers expect the three-day event to draw several thousand attendees from some 80 countries.

Elounda Bakker, a Dutch festival veteran of 15 years, played cards with a group of redheaded friends from across the world who meet together every year at the festival. 

“I came out of curiosity mostly, just to see what it would be like not to stand out in the crowd,” said Bakker, 29. “It was really an interesting first experience and I just keep coming because I met some really nice friends here.”

Magician Daniel Hank traveled six hours from Germany to join the festivities, now proud to flaunt the hair that made him the target of bullying when younger.

“I think it's really easy to recognize me because there are not that many people with a red beard, there are not many guys with long red hair,” he said. 

The festival is free and open to all, with the exception of the group photo on Sunday. That event is restricted to “natural” redheads.

The 2013 edition set a Guinness World Record for the “largest gathering of people with natural red hair” with 1,672 people posing for the group photo.




The tradition emerged two decades ago when Dutch artist Bart Rouwenhorst put out a call for 15 red-haired models for an art project in a local newspaper. He got ten times the response he was expecting and brought the group together for a photo.

The project got so much attention, Rouwenhorst organized a similar meetup the following year and has continued to oversee the festival as it has expanded into the multiday event it is today.

“The festival is really amazing because all the people, they resemble each other and they feel like it's a family,” he said.

Attorney General Pam Bondi on Friday fired a Justice Department employee for protesting against federal troops stationed in Washington, D.C.

Elizabeth Baxter was removed from her position as a paralegal specialist in the department's Environment and Natural Resources Division after she flipped off National Guard patrolling D.C. amid President Donald Trump's federal takeover of the city to combat crime. 

DOJ spokesman Gates McGavick praised the termination on Friday, writing in a post on X, “if you don't support law enforcement, [Attorney General Pam Bondi's] DOJ might not be a good fit.”

The announcement marks the second time in weeks Bondi has ousted a DOJ employee accused of demonstrating against the federalization of the country's capital. Earlier this month, paralegal Sean Dunn was fired from the department and slapped with a misdemeanor charge after being video recorded yelling obscenities at federal agents and throwing a Subway sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection officer. 

Baxter worked in the same building as Dunn, according to the New York Post. On three separate occasions during the month of August, she was recorded on DOJ security cameras flipping off National Guard troops or recounting the incident, as well as shouting “f*** you” at the troops, per the outlet. 

A memo signed by Bondi on Friday said Baxter was fired “effective immediately” for “inappropriate conduct.”

Trump's D.C. takeover has stirred controversy due to concerns that his actions constitute an authoritarian abuse of presidential powers.

HOUSE OVERSIGHT PREPARES TRANCHE OF DC CRIME BILLS AS TRUMP CRACKS DOWN ON DISTRICT

Others have defended the policy as necessary to combat crime in the country's capital, with D.C. mayor Muriel Bowser expressing thanks to Trump earlier this week for sending troops to assist the district's understaffed police force. 

“The most significant thing that we are highlighting today is the area of crime that was most troubling for us in 2023,” she said, noting that since the surge of federal officers, carjackings fell by 87% compared to the same period last year. “We know that when carjackings go down, when the use of gun goes down, when homicide or robbery go down, neighborhoods feel safer and are safer. So this surge has been important to us.”

NAZARETH, Israel (AP) — In the streets of Nazareth, Israeli and Palestinian activists wore stickers replicating the ‘Press' insignia emblazoned on flak jackets and other clothing worn by journalists as they rallied for peace in Gaza. Their message: Journalism is not a crime.

A throng of people wearing blue-and-white ‘Press' stickers — used to identify journalists in dangerous areas — gathered in the Israeli town on Friday to call for an end to the war in Gaza, which has killed nearly 200 journalists among tens of thousands of others. Some held photos of Palestinian journalists killed.

''Don't assassinate the truth,” read a banner the protesters held. Some banged on empty pots to symbolize hunger in the Gaza Strip and protest the killing of journalists.

Mariam Dagga, a 33-year-old who freelanced for The Associated Press, was among the war's victims. She and four other reporters were killed earlier this week when Israeli forces struck Nasser Hospital in the Gaza town of Khan Younis, along with 17 other people.

Dagga was among a group of journalists who regularly based themselves at the hospital during the war, which began on Oct. 7, 2023, when an attack by Hamas militants inside Israel claimed the lives of 1,200 people and resulted in 251 people being held hostage. Israel's retaliatory military operation in Gaza has so far killed more than 63,000 people, according to the territory's health ministry. 

Mariam sought to bring to the world the travails of ordinary Palestinians displaced by the war, as well as the work of doctors and nurses treating the wounded or caring for malnourished children.




The Israeli military said it targeted what it believed was a Hamas surveillance camera in the hospital attack, without providing evidence, and that the journalists weren't the targets. The prime minister called the attack a ‘'mishap.''

All that doesn't mean much for Mariam's father, Riyad, sitting in his tent in Khan Younis, nearly 180kilometers (111 miles) away from Nazareth. Poring over the last photos taken by his daughter, he recalled the utter shock he felt when he heard what happened.

“I couldn't walk. And I didn't know what was around me when I heard the news,” he told the AP. “The person who told me the news said that Mariam was martyred, and I collapsed,” he said, his eyes welling with tears as he watched a video of his daughter and him.

Mariam's sister, Nada, was with her at the hospital when she was killed. Nada recalled vividly the last look the two sisters exchanged when the second of two rounds of strikes hit the hospital's stairwell, where Mariam was killed. 

“Mariam, my sister, was on the stairs filming. I watched her and looked at her,” Nada said. “The last look between me and her. She looked at me and smiled.”

It was Mariam's brother, Mohamed, who rushed into the stairwell in search of his sister, finding her among the bodies of her colleagues.

“I pulled her out and took her from the fourth floor to the operations (room),” Mohamed said. “They told me to go downstairs at the reception until you receive (the body).”

Mariam's last photos showed the damaged stairwell outside Nasser Hospital, where she would be killed moments later. The photos show people walking up the staircase after it was damaged in the first strike, while others look out the hospital's windows.

Republicans in Congress are facing mounting pressure from both sides of the aisle about whether to extend additional Obamacare premium tax credit subsidies as part of legislation to avoid a government shutdown this fall. 

The popularity of the added Obamacare marketplace subsidies, which former President Joe Biden and Democrats passed during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic as a temporary measure, could make it difficult for Republicans to let them expire by January without facing blowback during the 2026 midterm elections. 

But conservatives argued that there is systemic fraud in the Obamacare insurance marketplace through the extended subsidies and are calling on President Donald Trump and the GOP to let the credits expire back to pre-pandemic levels.

The legislation passed by Democrats in 2021 and 2022 sweetened existing subsidies within the original Obamacare framework. It eliminated premiums for subsidized Obamacare plans for those between 100% and 150% of the federal poverty line and significantly lowered premiums for everyone else under 400% of the poverty line.

Coverage under subsidized Obamacare plans nearly doubled from 12 million before the subsidies were enacted to 24 million this year. 

Brian Blase, head of the Trump-aligned Paragon Health Institute, told reporters Thursday that bad actors, mainly insurance brokers, abuse these zero-premium plans by enrolling ineligible people and taking the payout from federal reimbursement. 

“What we are saying is happening is not a small-scale fraud activity; it is a nationwide massive amount of fraud and improper enrollment that has been perpetuated because of bad government policy, and that harms the legitimate enrollees and harms taxpayers that are funding all of this money,” said Blase.

Paragon estimates that as many as 6.4 million enrollees did not actually have income between 100% and 150% of the FPL and thus were improperly collecting premium subsidies, to the tune of $27 billion annually. 

Maria Ghazal, head of the industry interest group Healthcare Leadership Council, told the Washington Examiner that letting the tax credits expire to pre-pandemic levels “seems quite extreme,” considering the millions of people who depend on them to afford coverage. 

“Not to diminish the concern about fraud or waste or anything like that, but I think the No. 1 goal should be, ‘How do we preserve and extend these so that we can get coverage to the right people?'” Ghazal said.

Blase and his team at Paragon argue that the advanced premium tax credit system for Obamacare exchange subsidies incentivizes cheating the system because they are based on estimated income at the time of the open enrollment window before the coverage year starts. 

For example, an enrollee signing up for Obamacare coverage in the open enrollment period for 2025 will have to predict their income for 2026 to determine what subsidy they are eligible for to lower their insurance premium costs for the coverage year. Come tax season in 2027, they will have to reconcile the amount they estimated with how much they actually earned. 

If they earned more than predicted and, therefore, received more in subsidies than they should have, there is a limit on the amount that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services can recapture from them, depending on their income in relation to the poverty line. 

Paragon's estimates from CMS data found that improper exchange enrollment increased significantly from 2024 to 20205, from 5 million to 6.4 million enrollees collecting subsidies based on false income reporting. 

That means those individuals got to keep at least some, if not all, of their subsidy despite misreporting income.

In states that have expanded Medicaid coverage under Obamacare to slightly higher income levels, only people above 138% of the poverty line are eligible for subsidized exchange plans. 

Blase said that makes the math harder, but Paragon estimates that roughly 1.32 million enrollees in expansion states were improperly enrolled in a fully subsidized category. 

Paragon's report also argues that it is easier for people to be enrolled in both Medicaid and an Obamacare exchange plan in states with Medicaid expansion. In July, CMS found that nearly 3 million people were improperly enrolled in both coverage options, accounting for $14 billion.

Opponents of extending the premium tax credits argue that insurance companies gain the most from misestimating enrollee income because of the larger subsidies at stake. 

“The larger subsidies mean that consumers are less sensitive to prices of plans and are more likely to enroll,” reads Paragon's report on the topic. “It is also much easier for insurers to collect subsidies from the U.S. Treasury than from customers. In many cases, enrollees are actually unaware of their enrollment in these plans.”

A Congressional Budget Office report from Aug. 25 found a similar pattern of overreporting income in states that did not expand Medicaid coverage, but its numbers are significantly lower than Paragon's estimates. 

The CBO estimates that 1.3 million marketplace enrollees intentionally overinflated their incomes in 2023 to receive the premium tax credit, and that number ballooned to 2.3 million in 2025.

CBO's analysis of HealthCare.gov data found that a disproportionate number of enrollees from states that did not expand Medicaid reported income between 100% and 105% of the FPL, outnumbering the percentage of the population in that income range who did not have an employment-based plan or Medicaid. 

In other words, more people claimed to make between 100% and 105% of the FPL than actually existed, according to the CBO. 

Larry Levitt, vice president of health policy at the organization KFF, which supports extending the tax credits, told the Washington Examiner before the CBO's report was released that “there isn't compelling evidence that fraud is the primary driver of the rapid enrollment growth in recent years.”

“The enhanced tax credits have made available coverage with no premium to the lowest-income enrollees, which has proven to be a powerful incentive to get insurance, especially for healthier people who may not think they need coverage,” said Levitt. “The enhanced premium subsidies have also made coverage more affordable for middle-income people who were eligible for no financial help before.”

Ghazal told the Washington Examiner that industry leaders are pressuring Congress to include extending the premium subsidies in the government funding legislation that must be passed before Sept. 30 to avoid a shutdown in October.

This is especially important considering that open enrollment for insurance plans starts Nov. 1. Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act also shortened the Obamacare open enrollment deadline by a month, from Jan. 15 to Dec. 15, narrowing the window even further for Congress to act should it decide to extend the subsidies.

Ghazal said that conversations on Capitol Hill are “not quite bipartisan” at this point, but she hopes they will be before the Sept. 30 spending deadline.

“I think that having conversations about how to move forward, that's the most important thing right now, to get people to the table,” said Ghazal.

Without the subsidies, healthcare costs are expected to increase dramatically on Jan. 1.

If the additional tax credits are not extended by the end of the year, Obamacare enrollees could see as much as a 75% increase in their premiums, depending on their plan.

The CBO estimated that more than 4 million people will be priced out of Obamacare coverage if subsidies expire, raising the uninsured rate.

Not extending the premium tax credits could be a liability for Republicans heading into the 2026 midterm elections. 

Chris Pope, health policy expert for the Manhattan Institute, told the Washington Examiner that the issue of expiring subsidies is “politically a much bigger deal” even than the changes to Medicaid policy passed in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act this summer, which caused significant hesitation on the part of vulnerable Republicans in Congress.

Pope said there's merit to the evidence that suggests system-wide fraud because of the Biden-era subsidies, but he also said the consequences of not extending them could be too much for Republicans seeking reelection.

“These subsidies are very big, and they would have an immediate impact, and so I think there's going to be a real desire to not get caught on the wrong side of it, politically, from Republicans,” said Pope. 

A July poll from Tony Fabrizio and Bob Ward, GOP pollsters praised by Trump in the past, found that Republicans in swing districts for House seats could benefit from supporting the extended tax credits.

The poll found that Republicans who supported the tax credits could gain a 6-point advantage over Democrats overall and a 4-point lead among most likely voters. 

A handful of Senate Republicans expressed interest in extending the tax credits during and immediately after the passage of Trump's reconciliation package. Those include Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Susan Collins (R-ME), Thom Tillis (R-NC), and Josh Hawley (R-MO).

            For one final time, Lee Corso will don the head of a college football mascot and utter his famous catchphrase: “Not so fast, my friend.”
    


            Saturday's ESPN broadcast of defending national champion Ohio State hosting Texas will signal the end of the era as Corso steps away after a legendary stint in college football.
    


            First as a player, then a coach and finally a broadcaster, the now-90-year-old has been a mainstay in the collegiate ranks for more than 75 years and has had an immeasurable impact.
    


            Known for his larger-than-life personality – and the even bigger mascot heads he's worn – Corso retires as one of the pioneers of football television.
    


            “My goal on TV was to bring a smile to everybody's face. I hope I have done that,” Corso said on stage at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles when he was honored at the ESPYs in July.
    


            Corso's football career began in the 1950s when he took the field for the Florida State Seminoles, where he played as both a quarterback and cornerback. As a CB, he held the school record for interceptions for two decades.
    


            After graduating, he turned his attention to coaching. Over a 28-year career, he coached at Louisville, Indiana, Navy and Northern Illinois, as well as a brief stint as the head coach of the Orlando Renegades in the United States Football League (USFL).
    


            His achievements across multiple programs have led to his induction into multiple athletic Halls of Fame, including at Florida State, Louisville and Indiana, in addition to the state of Florida Sports Hall of Fame and the Kentucky Athletic Hall of Fame.
    


            But it was only when the USFL fell apart in the mid-1980s that Corso turned his attention to television.
    


            He was hired to be part of ESPN's “College GameDay” program as an analyst in 1987 and, for 38 seasons, has remained an anchor of the team.
    


            In 1996, Corso started something that had a lasting impact not only on the show but on college football as a whole: wearing oversized mascot headgear during live broadcasts.
    


            Ahead of that season's Ohio State-Penn State game, Corso put on Buckeyes mascot Brutus' headgear and the rest was history.
    


            Since then, Corso has dressed up as Notre Dame's Fighting Irish Leprechaun, the Stanford Tree, and even rode a motorcycle with the Oregon Duck, among many others that brought smiles to not only the faces of fans but also his colleagues.
    


            Corso would don the comically large headpieces while making game predictions, holding a Ticonderoga No. 2 pencil in hand and uttering his famous catchphrase. This famed tradition has been a staple on ESPN's college football coverage for almost four decades.
    


            Corso has made 430 mascot headgear selections all-time, compiling a 286-144 record. He has thrown on Brutus' head the most at 45 times with Alabama mascot Big Al's head coming in second with 38 picks.
    


            He has worn the headgear of 69 different teams and, as a former assistant coach at Navy, has never picked against the Midshipmen. He went on a magical streak of predictions in 1999, going 11-0 with his headgear picks, the most wins without a loss in a single season since he began the tradition.
    


            “My family and I will be forever indebted for the opportunity to be part of ESPN and College Gameday for nearly 40 years,” Corso said when his retirement was announced in April. “I have a treasure of many friends, fond memories and some unusual experiences to take with me into retirement.”
    


            In 2009, Corso suffered a stroke which left him unable to speak for a while but he eventually made a return to ESPN's coverage.
    


            A year later, he was honored by the National College Football Awards Association with the Contributions to College Football Award in recognition of his lifetime of achievement and integrity in the sport.
    


            Ahead of his final game, Corso was honored by Southwest Airlines as he waited to board his flight to Columbus, with the staff and waiting customers all giving him a standing ovation.
    


            “With the popularity and cultural phenomenon that ‘GameDay' became, there's no one more responsible for that than Lee Corso. He changed the way the game was covered with the irreverence, the humor, the lack of a filter, all of those things that sort of set the tone and the standard,” “GameDay” host Rece Davis said of Corso's impact on ESPN's coverage.
    


            Corso steps away as a seemingly ever-present figure on college football coverage and one whose impact will be felt for the next generation of broadcasters and fans.
    


            Will someone else put on the mascot headgear to continue and honor Corso's tradition? Or will the segment also be retired alongside Corso? One thing is for sure though: The future of college football broadcasting will most certainly look very different without him on the panel.

As the investigation into a viral beating in Cincinnati that shook the nation and has been described as "a racial issue" continues, a victim and multiple suspects are facing criminal charges. 

In the early morning hours of July 26, a confrontation outside the LoVe nightclub, located on the corner of Fourth and Elm Street in the city's downtown business district, led to a horrific beatdown that was captured on video. 

The video circulated rapidly on social media, sparking fury as at least two White victims were pummeled into the ground by a group of Black suspects. Once on the ground, the suspects did not back off. Instead, they continued to stomp on the victims, one of whom was left with a life-altering brain issue.

CINCINNATI BEATDOWN SUSPECT INDICTED ON FEDERAL DRUG CONSPIRACY CHARGES

The fallout from the assault has thrown city leadership into turmoil, as Mayor Aftab Pureval was missing in action for several days following the incident, leading to the local Fraternal Order Police (FOP) unanimously voting no-confidence in him. 

Meanwhile, suspects have been rounded up locally and across state lines. All have been charged at the state level, and some face serious federal charges. 

Here is the status of each suspect:

Mathews, who has been described by prosecutors as the "coordinator" of the brawl, is in federal custody after being arrested Monday on charges unrelated to the beatdown. 

He has been charged federally with conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute 40 grams or more of fentanyl and operating a premises for the purpose of trafficking narcotics. 

Thursday, he appeared before a federal judge for a bond hearing, and his attorney Kara Blackney successfully argued that since he has no prior violent felony convictions and plenty of ties to the Cincinnati community, including three children and a business, he should be released from custody while awaiting trial on those charges.

However, federal prosecutors immediately appealed that decision, and as of Friday, Mathews remained in custody where he will stay until the appeal is heard. 

Those drug charges arose after he posted a $270,000 bond and was released from local custody on the charges stemming from the fight: three counts of felonious assault, three counts of assault and two counts of aggravated rioting.

After the July 26 melee, Merriweather was assessed a $250,000 bond on three counts of felonious assault, three counts of assault and two counts of aggravated rioting.

He did not post bond.

On Aug. 13, he was charged federally with illegally possessing a firearm as a previously convicted felon stemming from a July 2 incident. 

Despite the federal charge, Hamilton County Jail records indicate that Merriweather is still being held in Cincinnati.

CINCINNATI BEATDOWN SUSPECTS ARRAIGNED ON NEW CHARGES; BOND CHANGES SPARK COURTROOM DRAMA

Rosemond, who is the suspect accused of nearly beating a victim, Holly, to death, remains in local custody on a $500,000 bond for three counts of felonious assault, three counts of assault and two counts of aggravated rioting.

He is described as a "main instigator" of the fight.

Holly revealed that she suffered "very bad brain trauma" during the attack, and is unsure the degree to which she will recover. She can be seen in the viral video being knocked unconscious and falling onto the pavement at the intersection of Fourth and Elm Street. 

He was arrested in Georgia and hauled back to Cincinnati, where he was booked into the Hamilton County Jail on Aug. 14.

Wright was booked into the county jail on Aug. 11 on charges of aggravated riot and aggravated robbery.

He is accused of snatching a chain off of one of the victims during the beatdown before proceeding "to film the rest of the events."

Wright has 22 prior arrests and two prior felony convictions, one for trafficking heroin and one for possessing a firearm as a prohibited person.

He is being held on $100,000 bond.

Kittle has been charged with three counts of felonious assault, three counts of assault and two counts of aggravated rioting and is being held on a $150,000 bond in the Hamilton County Jail. 

At an Aug. 14 arraignment, he was ordered to remain in jail pending a mental health assessment. During that hearing, his attorney said he suffers from schizophrenia and has been found not guilty by way of insanity on previous charges. 

Nonetheless, prosecutors called him a "grave danger to the community."

CINCINNATI RESIDENTS ON EDGE AFTER VIRAL BEATDOWN SPARKS CRIME CONCERNS: 'WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN NEXT?'

Vernon is one of two female suspects who was arrested in connection with the attack. She faces three counts of felonious assault, three counts of assault and two counts of aggravated rioting.

However, during her arraignment, her bond was dropped from $250,000 to $25,000 at 10%, with the judge citing her lack of a criminal history. She paid that bond and was released from jail with an electronic ankle monitor pending trial.

Devaughn is also out on bond pending trial. 

During her arraignment, her bond was lowered from $300,000 to $25,000 at 10%, which she later posted.

An eighth person, 45-year-old Alex Tchervinski, a victim of the brawl, has been charged with disorderly conduct related to the assault. 

Tchervinski can be seen in the viral video slapping one of the suspects, which his lawyer claims occurred after he had already been hit. 

His lawyer, Douglas Brannon, said his client was allegedly hit in the head 28 times and robbed during the attack, while trying to protect his girlfriend and another friend during the melee.

"What this has done, it has made Alex a victim now for the second time by bringing criminal charges against him," Brannon told Fox News Digital. "What actually occurred is Alex was hit multiple times, before he slapped back in an attempt to try and defend himself and back off this group of thugs."

Tchervinski's arrest has become a point of contention between the police and the mayor's office. 

When the FOP voted no-confidence in Pureval earlier this week, they said Aftab also ordered the city solicitor to charge a White victim of the brutal beatdown with a crime "solely to appease racial tensions at the urging of a few community leaders." 

One of those community leaders, Reverend Damon Lynch, demanded that the victims be arrested at a press conference with Aftab in the week following the attack.

"For those who want to racialize it, then a black man stepped in between the combatants, separated them and said, ‘this is about stop fighting, everybody needs to chill,'" said Lynch, who is Black. "And then, for those who want to racialize it, the white man being steps back in the ring and slaps not the black man that he had just squared up with, but slaps another black man. So after that he was met with disproportionate force." 

"But when I see the mugshots, I only see people who look like me," he said. "I don't see the person who re-engaged. And so until we see all the mugshots, this is still a racial issue."

Aftab agreed. 

"I agree with Pastor Lynch, that there is no doubt that this public safety challenge, that this incident will require further investigation, further charges and further arrests for every single person involved," he said.

It still remains unclear what exactly sparked the beatings, but the investigation remains ongoing. Police are currently searching for at least one more suspect.

            They have helped put out fires in neighborhoods, offered shelter, food and spiritual guidance to those in need and provided live coverage of protests and immigration enforcement to hundreds of thousands of Spanish speakers. Many are parents and the sole providers for their families.
    


            But despite their contributions, immigration officials still detained them as part of President Donald Trump's massive crackdown on undocumented immigrants.

            The arrests happened as some of these immigrants were working or commuting to and from their jobs.
    


            Neighbors, friends and colleagues have united behind many of the community pillars taken into custody in recent months raising tens of thousands of dollars for their families and legal fees and urging immigration authorities to release them.
    


            Here are some of the prominent community members who have been arrested by ICE in recent months:
    


            Milton Guamarrigra is known to many in Port Chester, New York, as a family man who made a living as a marble installer and a volunteer with the local fire department.
    


            But that life was ripped away from Guamarrigra earlier this month when United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers arrested him as he was leaving his home to go to work, according to CNN affiliate WLNY.
    


            Many in the community are rallying behind Guamarrigra who, as of early August, was being held at an ICE field office in Michigan, according to CNN affiliate WLNY.
    


            Port Chester Mayor Luis Marino said he has known Guamarrigra and his family for many years and wrote a letter to the federal government highlighting Guamarriga's volunteer service to the fire department and good character. Marino said the fire department volunteers are like a family and Guamarrigra was part of it.
    


            “He was active, and he was there when we needed him,” Marino said. “He got along with everyone.”
    


            According to WLNY, Guamarrigra wanted to go to college and study IT and had worked for 20 years as a local marble installer.
    


            Marino said Guamarrigra immigrated to the US from Ecuador but was uncertain how long ago.
    


            Court records show Guamarrigra was convicted twice of driving while intoxicated in New York in 2003 and 2006.
    


            Guamarrigra's family has raised more than $13,000 on GoFundMe to help pay for their legal fees “to ensure he receives a fair chance and that we can work toward bringing him home.”
    


            “My father has recently been detained, and our family is navigating a deeply emotional and challenging time,” the GoFundMe page read. “He is a loving father, a hardworking man, and someone who has always put his family first.”
    


            “The way that they took my father … they made it out to seem like he was a criminal when that's not even the case at all,” Guamarrigra's daughter, Jocelyn Guamarrigra, told WLNY.
    


            Journalist Mario Guevara has spent the last 20 years covering law enforcement and immigration in the metro Atlanta area.
    


            He has worked for several Spanish language outlets and founded the digital news outlet MG News which has 113,000 followers on Facebook; his personal account has 782,000 followers.
    


            On June 14, Guevara was arrested while livestreaming law enforcement officers at a “No Kings” demonstration in the metro Atlanta area. The event was one of a few thousand held across the country that day in protest of President Donald Trump and his policies.
    


            Guevara, who came to the US from El Salvador in 2004, was charged with improperly entering a pedestrian roadway, obstruction of law enforcement officers and unlawful assembly. He was wearing a vest and press credentials at the time of his arrest.
    


            Guevara has legal authorization to work in the United States but does not hold a permanent resident card, advocates say.
    


            A habeas corpus petition filed by Guevara on Aug. 20 says that during a bond a hearing on July 1, the “government asserted that Mr. Guevara posed a danger to the community because of his reporting.” An immigration judge, however, disagreed and granted him bond, the petition states.
    


            The federal government appealed Guevara's release on bond, and the Board of Immigration Appeals granted a stay, according to the legal filing. Guevara remains in custody despite all charges against him being dropped.
    


            He is being held in isolation at Folkston ICE Processing Center in Folkston, Georgia – his fifth detention location in more than two months, according to the ACLU.
    


            Katherine Jacobsen, program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists, said the federal government's refusal to release Guevara “sends a very chilling message both to those who might be caught up in ICE actions as well as journalists … that there will be consequences if you cover this topic.”
    


            “The charges against him have been dropped,” Jacobsen said. “There is no rational reason that we are aware of, that the government has made public, as to why he is continuing to be held.”
    


            Jacobsen said Guevara has three children and is the primary breadwinner for his family.  One of Guevara's children relies on him for long-term medical care, according to the ACLU.



            “They were relying on him to put food on the table, and he is now in prison,” Jacobsen said. “It's a very difficult situation.”
    


            Daniel Fuentes Espinal came to the US from Honduras in 2001 to flee poverty and violence.
    


            Espinal built a life for himself and his family here, working in construction and volunteering as a pastor at Iglesia del Nazareno Jesus Te Ama, also known as the Church of the Nazarene Jesus Loves You, in Easton, Maryland.
    


            Espinal became known as a spiritual leader who opened up his home and provided shelter, food, coats and suits for job interviews for those in need, family friend Len Foxwell said.
    


            On July 21, ICE agents arrested the father of three for overstaying his visa. His daughter Clarissa Fuentes Diaz told CNN the arrest happened as Espinal left McDonald's and headed to a construction site to drop off some materials he bought at Lowe's. An unmarked vehicle, she said, followed him, pulled him over and a uniformed officer arrested him.
    


            ICE confirmed Espinal's arrest to CNN last month saying in a statement he was “an illegal alien from Honduras who was arrested by ICE on July 21, in Easton, Maryland.”
    


            “Fuentes entered the United States on a 6-month visa and never left in 24 years,” the statement said. “It is a federal crime to overstay the authorized period of time granted under a visitor's visa.”
    


            Espinal was released from custody on August 15 after supporters wrote dozens of letters highlighting his impact on the community and advocating for him to be freed, Foxwell said.
    


            Foxwell said he believes the letters as well as the national attention Espinal's case received weighed heavily on the judge's decision to release him.
    


            “I believe it was a combination of the intense level of interest in the pastor's plight and his remarkable personal attributes,” Foxwell said.
    


            Foxwell said Espinal's arrest was “devastating and frightening” because he was such a pillar for the Easton community. Now, he said, there is “a sense of relief and a sense of joy.”
    


            “If something like this can happen to somebody with his reputation and stature, then it really was a sobering reminder that it could happen to anybody and therefore nobody is safe,” Foxwell said.
    


            Espinal had spent the last decade trying to apply for a green card but faced a lot of bureaucratic red tape, according to Foxwell. He will now resume that process so he can remain in the US legally, Foxwell said.
    


            Foxwell noted Espinal does not have a criminal record. Online court records in Maryland also indicate that Fuentes Espinal has no criminal history.
    


            “For those who falsely characterize these immigrants as being net takers from society, I think the experience of Pastor Fuentes Espinal reveals the lie of that mentality,” he said. “This is someone who was putting money back into the economy by earning a fair wage for a hard day's work and paying his taxes faithfully.”

            A class of drugs called beta-blockers — used for decades as a first-line treatment after a heart attack— doesn't benefit the vast majority of patients and may contribute to a higher risk of hospitalization and death in some women but not in men, according to groundbreaking new research.
    


New blood pressure guidelines recommend an earlier start to treatment and skipping alcohol



            “These findings will reshape all international clinical guidelines on the use of beta-blockers in men and women and should spark a long-needed, sex-specific approach to treatment for cardiovascular disease,” said senior study author Dr. Valentin Fuster, president of Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital in New York City and general director of the National Center for Cardiovascular Investigation in Madrid.
    


            Women with little heart damage after their heart attacks who were treated with beta-blockers were significantly more likely to have another heart attack or be hospitalized for heart failure — and nearly three times more likely to die — compared with women not given the drug, according to a study published in the European Heart Journal and also scheduled to be presented Saturday at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Madrid.
    


            “This was especially true for women receiving high doses of beta-blockers,” said lead study author Dr. Borja Ibáñez, scientific director for Madrid's National Center for Cardiovascular Investigation.
    


            “The total number of women in the clinical trial was the largest ever included in a study testing beta-blockers after myocardial infarction (heart attack), so this is a significant finding,” said Ibáñez, a cardiologist at Madrid's Jiménez Díaz Foundation University Hospital.



            The findings, however, only applied to women with a left ventricular ejection fraction above 50%, which is considered normal function, the study said. Ejection fraction is a way of measuring how well the left side of the heart is pumping oxygenated blood throughout the body. For anyone with a score below 40% after a heart attack, beta-blockers continue to be the standard of care due to their ability to calm heart arrhythmias that may trigger a second event.
    


            Still, the drug can have unpleasant side effects, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver.
    


            “The drugs can lead to low blood pressure, low heart rate, erectile dysfunction, fatigue and mood swings,” said Freeman, who was not involved in the research. “Anytime we use these drugs, we always have to balance risk versus benefit.”
    


            Why would women be more susceptible to harm from beta-blockers than men?
    


            “That's actually not surprising,” Freeman said. “Gender has a lot to do with how people respond to medication. In many cases, women have smaller hearts. They're more sensitive to blood pressure medications. Some of that may have to do with size, and some may have to do with other factors we have yet to fully understand.”
    


            In fact, because early research on the heart focused on men, it took medical science years to discover that heart disease presents differently in women. Men typically have plaque buildup in their major arteries and experience more traditional signs of a heart attack such as chest pain. Women are more likely to have plaque in the heart's smaller blood vessels and can have more unusual symptoms of a heart attack such as back pain, indigestion and shortness of breath.
    


            The analysis on women was part of a much larger clinical trial called REBOOT — Treatment with Beta-Blockers after Myocardial Infarction without Reduced Ejection Fraction — which followed 8,505 men and women treated for heart attacks at 109 hospitals in Spain and Italy for nearly four years.
    


            Results of the study were published in The New England Journal of Medicine and also presented at the European Society of Cardiology Congress.
    


            None of the patients in the trial had a left ventricular ejection fraction below 40%, a sign of potential heart failure.
    


            “We found no benefit in using beta-blockers for men or women with preserved heart function after heart attack despite this being the standard of care for some 40 years,” said Fuster, former editor-in-chief of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology and past president of the American Heart Association and the World Health Federation.
    


            That's likely due to advances in medication treatment such as the immediate use of stents and blood thinners after patients arrive at the hospital. In fact, most men and women who survive heart attacks today have ejection fractions above 50%, Ibáñez said.
    


            “Yet at this time, some 80% of patients in the US, Europe and Asia are treated with beta-blockers because medical guidelines still recommend them,” he said. “While we often test new drugs, it's much less common to rigorously question the continued need for older treatments.”
    


            While the study did not find any need to use beta-blockers for people with a left ventricular ejection fraction above 50% after a heart attack, a separate meta-analysis of 1,885 patients published Saturday in The Lancet did find benefits for those with scores between 40% and 50%, in which the heart may be mildly damaged.
    


            “This subgroup did benefit from a routine use of beta-blockers,” said Ibáñez, who was also a coauthor on this paper. “We found about a 25% reduction in the primary endpoint, which was a composite of new heart attacks, heart failure and all-cause death.”

The Trump administration is cracking down on crime in D.C. and mobilizing National Guard soldiers and airmen.

Attorney General Pam Bondi fired another Department of Justice paralegal on Friday, this time for flipping off a member of the National Guard in Washington, D.C., on her way to work earlier this month.

Elizabeth Baxter of the department's environmental division arrived for work just after 8:20 a.m. on Aug. 18 at the DOJ's "4CON" building in the NoMa district, where she bragged to a security guard that she had just made the gesture at Metro Center Metro Stop and told the guardsman, "F--k the National Guard," Bondi said, according to the New York Post.

"Today, I took action to terminate a DOJ employee for inappropriate conduct towards National Guard service members in DC," Bondi told the outlet.

"This DOJ remains committed to defending President Trump's agenda and fighting to make America safe again," she continued. "If you oppose our mission and disrespect law enforcement — you will NO LONGER work at DOJ."

Later that day, Baxter was seen on DOJ security footage sticking up her middle finger at the National Guard and exclaiming, "F--k you!" the outlet reported. She was also allegedly seen demonstrating to a department security guard how she held up her middle finger.

On Aug. 25, she allegedly arrived at work and again boasted to the security guard that she hated the National Guard and that she told them to "F--k off!"

"You are removed from your position of Paralegal Specialist, GS-0950-11, Environmental Defense Section, Environment and Natural Resources Division, and from the federal service, effective immediately," Bondi wrote in a termination letter to Baxter on Friday following an investigation into her conduct, according to the outlet.

The Trump administration moved in recent weeks to boost the presence of federal law enforcement in D.C. in an attempt to reduce crime. Hundreds of federal agents and National Guard troops have been deployed to the city's streets as part of the federal takeover of the district.

Baxter's termination comes after Sean Charles Dunn, another DOJ paralegal, was fired after he was accused of throwing a sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection agent earlier this month in Washington, D.C.

Dunn, who worked in the criminal division's international affairs section in the 4CON building, was initially charged with a felony, but a grand jury declined to hand down an indictment. He was subsequently charged with a misdemeanor, which could result in up to one year in jail.

            Autocrats, populists, friends and foes, a strongman waging a war in Europe and the leader of the world's biggest democracy will all be hosted by Chinese leader Xi Jinping this weekend at a summit designed to showcase Beijing as a global leader capable of providing a counterweight to Western institutions.
    


            Heads of state and delegations from across Asia and the Middle East will meet from Sunday in the Chinese port city of Tianjin for the two-day summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a regional security grouping that has emerged as a cornerstone of Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin's drive to rebalance global power in their favor.
    


            Chinese officials have billed the summit as the SCO's largest yet, with the diplomacy and pageantry setting the stage for Xi to tout his country as a stable and powerful alternative leader at a time when the world's leading superpower the United States under President Donald Trump is shaking up its alliances and waging a global trade war. 



            The gathering also comes days ahead of a major military parade in Beijing that will offer a different message – that of China's rapidly developing military might, and draw autocrats like North Korea's Kim Jong Un and Myanmar's Min Aung Hlaing alongside Putin and Russia-friendly European leaders Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia and Slovakia's Robert Fico.
    


            The summit also gifts Russia's Putin some international spotlight, just two weeks after his Alaska summit with Trump, and as he continues to ignore international pressure to end his onslaught in Ukraine. Earlier this week Russia's forces carried out the second-biggest aerial attack since its full-scale invasion of its neighbor.
    


            Ahead of his arrival Putin praised the China-Russia partnership as a “stabilizing force” for the world. In a written interview for Chinese state news agency Xinhua, he said they were “united in our vision of building a just, multipolar world order” – an allusion to the two countries' efforts to revise what they see as a US-led world order unfairly stacked against them.
    


            SCO members – which include China, Russia, India, Iran, Pakistan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan – preside over vast swaths of global energy reserves and govern some 40% of the global population.
    


            The guests at the summit have national rivalries between them and vast differences in political systems. And while this has sparked criticism of the group as too disparate to be effective, it also may serve to underscore Xi's message.
    


            “Beijing wants to signal that China is the indispensable convener in Eurasia, capable of seating rivals at the same table and translating great-power competition into managed interdependence,” said Rabia Akhtar, director of the Centre for Security, Strategy and Policy Research at the University of Lahore in Pakistan.
    


            “The optics are straightforward: China is not just a participant in regional order-making – it is a primary architect and host.”
    


            Modi's attendance at the gathering also adds heft to Xi's guest list. The Indian prime minister skipped last year's summit in Kazakhstan. He now arrives in Tianjin against a backdrop of souring relations with Washington – and as Beijing and New Delhi have moved to ease their own frictions, a nascent realignment that could imperil US efforts to cultivate India as a counterweight against a rising China.
    


            Delegations are also expected from the SCO's 16 official partner and observer countries, which include Cambodia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, and Kuwait, as well as NATO member Turkey, among others, Chinese officials said ahead of the gathering.
    


            Beijing additionally invited a handful of Southeast Asian leaders. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is also expected to attend.
    


            Across the city of Tianjin, banners in English, Russian and Chinese heralding the gathering lined highways. Officials heavily restricted traffic in the city center as Chinese leaders prepare to welcome their guests with the ceremony and pomp typical of Chinese diplomacy at the highest level.
    


            The location has pointed symbolism for China, as a port that was forced open by colonial powers in the 19th century, with those from Europe and Imperial Japan receiving land concessions – and a key city occupied by Japan during World War II.
    


            Some guests, including Putin, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, are slated to stay for the military parade in Beijing, where the ruling Communist Party will show off its military might and play up its role fighting Imperial Japan as part of the Allied Forces in World War II as the globe marks 80 years since the end of that war.
    


            Since its formation in 2001 as a group focused on regional security cooperation between China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization has expanded in its size and scope.
    


            SCO members conduct joint counter-terrorism drills, share intelligence on combatting “terrorism, separatism, and extremism,” and work to expand coordination across areas like education, trade and energy. They're also united in a call for a “just” international order – or one not led by a single superpower and its allies.
    


            Iran's inclusion in the group in 2023 and Belarus' a year later have been widely seen as an effort by Beijing and Moscow to the make the body more explicitly anti-West. It also is one facet of a tightening of bonds between Moscow, Beijing and Tehran that's raised alarm in Washington.
    


            Now, growing frictions and uncertainties between some countries and the US under Trump will loom over the gathering – a reality sure to be referenced prominently if indirectly in remarks by Xi to his guests in the days ahead.
    


            Observers will be watching whether this summit will produce momentum toward further economic integration between member countries, especially when it comes to regional trade or development finance, but expectations for practical developments are low.
    


            “Without deeply addressing what the mission of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization should be and how it can resolve internal sources of conflict both between members and between members with external countries, the SCO is just a showcase,” said Shanghai-based foreign affairs analyst Shen Dingli.
    


            Even as the group regularly calls for “avoiding bloc, ideological or confrontational approaches” to addressing security threats, its summits have yet to produce a joint statement mentioning the war in Ukraine.
    


            SCO – and its lead members China and Russia – also appeared to have little role in de-escalating a four-day conflict between members India and Pakistan earlier this year.
    


            The group did, however, “strongly condemn” the military strikes carried out by the US and Israel on Iran this past June.

Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy reports on how the Trump administration is taking credit for the lowest Labor Day gas prices in five years on ‘America Reports.'

The Pentagon is standing firmly behind Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness Anthony Tata, who is facing a legal dispute in Florida connected to a self-described astrologer.

Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell told Fox News that Tata continues to enjoy full confidence from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

"Under Secretary Tata has the complete and total confidence of Secretary Hegseth in his role and will continue to have his support," Parnell said. "Mr. Tata has done a fantastic job delivering on the priorities of this Department and this administration. We strongly stand by him."

PENTAGON TAPS CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES TO ASSIST TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT

According to a 17-page complaint filed in Palm Beach County and obtained by Fox News Digital, John Doe, whose personal details align with Tata, accused Amy Tripp of harassment, defamation and attempted extortion. The suit alleges she threatened his marriage and career while demanding money to remain silent.

The filing states Doe and Tripp met in April 2024 on the dating app Bumble while Doe was working on a book and consulting about "astrological beliefs and related issues." 

Their relationship developed into both "a casual sexual relationship as well as a professional relationship regarding the astrology business." Doe also invested in Tripp's company, Starheal LLC, in exchange for a 5% equity stake.

PENTAGON UNVEILS NEW MEDAL FOR TROOPS DEPLOYED IN TRUMP'S SOUTHERN BORDER CRACKDOWN

Court records show that a temporary restraining order was granted against Tripp on Aug. 7, 2025, after the alleged harassment escalated. A summons issued later that month ordered her to respond to the allegations within 20 days.

While the Florida case unfolds, Tata's career spans decades of military and public service. A retired Army brigadier general and novelist, he spent 28 years in uniform, including service in Afghanistan. After retiring, he transitioned into civilian leadership roles, including stints in education and as North Carolina's transportation secretary.

Tata, a graduate of West Point, is also a recipient of the Army Distinguished Service Medal, Defense Superior Service Medal, Legion of Merit, Combat Action Badge, Afghanistan Campaign Medal, Kosovo Campaign Medal, and Ranger Tab.

His public career has not been without turbulence. Tata resigned from the transportation post in 2015, following scrutiny from his management, and his nomination for a top Pentagon role in 2020 drew attention to past social media posts as reported by CNN. Tata later apologized for his remarks.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt calls her predecessor Jen Psaki's comments about the Minneapolis church shooting 'utterly disrespectful.'

Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democrat-turned-Republican now serving as director of National Intelligence, is blasting former White House press secretary Jen Psaki in the wake of the Minneapolis Catholic school shooting that left two children dead and 18 others injured on Wednesday.

Psaki went viral on X for her post which asserted "prayer is not freaking enough" in the wake of the tragic incident. 

Gabbard accused Psaki and other critics of public prayer of harboring "hatred of God," calling them "agents of darkness" in a lengthy X post Friday.

Psaki said: "Prayer is not freaking enough. Prayers does not end school shootings. Prayers do not make parents feel safe sending their kids to school. Prayer does not bring these kids back. Enough with the thoughts and prayers." Her post garnered over 15 million views on X.

Gabbard responded: "So why is it that people like Jen Psaki and others have such a spontaneous visceral negative reaction to those who are praying to God for refuge, strength, and for the wellbeing of the victims of this heinous attack? Because they do not believe in God or His love."

"Their response is rooted in their hatred of God," Gabbard added. "They want to be God, so they view Him as their competitor. They are agents of darkness and hatred, and the light of God's love is a threat to their dark ambitions."

She tied her criticism to more policy causes for the Democrat Party, calling transgender rights "insanity and darkness" and citing Martin Luther King Jr.'s famous line: "Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that."

Republicans quickly rallied behind Gabbard. 

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Psaki's dismissal of prayer was "utterly disrespectful" and urged her to pray for the grieving families instead.

Vice President JD Vance added on X: "Why would Jen Psaki attack people for praying when those children were literally praying as they were murdered?"

Minneapolis now finds itself at the center of both America's gun violence crisis and its deepening divide over how the nation mourns and seeks change.

HONOLULU (AP) — A lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Hawaii imposing a tourist tax to deal with consequences of climate change seeks to stop officials from enforcing the new law on cruise ship passengers.

In the nation's first such levy to help cope with a warming planet, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green signed legislation in May that raises tax revenue to deal with eroding shorelines, wildfires and other climate problems. Officials estimate the tax will generate nearly $100 million annually. 

The levy increases rates on hotel room and vacation rental stays but also imposes a new 11% tax on the gross fares paid by a cruise ship's passengers, starting next year, prorated for the number of days the vessels are in Hawaii ports. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. court in Honolulu this week, notes the law authorizes counties to collect an additional 3% surcharge, bringing the total to 14% of prorated fares. 

“No other State imposes comparable fees — and for good reason: It has been a fundamental principle since the Founding that the navigable waters of the United States are a common resource, not one to be commandeered by individual States for their own parochial revenue-raising interests,” attorneys representing the Cruise Lines International Association wrote in a motion asking a judge to prevent the state and counties from collecting the tax on cruise ships while the lawsuit is pending.

A Honolulu company that provides supplies and provisions to cruise ships, and tour businesses out of Kauai and the Big Island that rely on cruise ship passengers joined the cruise ship association in the lawsuit.




The defendants are various state tax and county finance officials.

The Hawaii attorney general's office declined to comment Friday on the lawsuit until it had been reviewed.

Hawaii County spokesperson Tom Callis said they don't comment on pending litigation. Spokesman Ian Scheuring said Honolulu officials decline to comment until they're reviewed the lawsuit. County representatives for Maui and Kauai didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment. 

According to the lawsuit, the cruise ship industry draws nearly 300,000 annual visitors to Hawaii, supporting thousands of jobs throughout the state and contributing more than $600 million a year to the economy.

The tax would make Hawaii cruises too expensive, and potential visitors will choose to vacation elsewhere, the lawsuit said.

The plaintiffs, in a motion seeking a preliminary injunction to declare the law's cruise-related provisions unconstitutional and bar its enforcement, urges a judge to act swiftly because cruise-ship passengers typically make travel plans well in advance. A hearing is scheduled for Oct. 31. 

The impending surcharge “will begin to skew the market even before they take effect,” causing families who would have purchased Hawaii cruise tickets in 2026 to make other vacation plans, the motion said.

The new law adds 0.75% to the existing 10.25% tax on daily hotel and vacation room stays for a 11% total. Hawaii's counties each add their own 3% surcharge, and the state and counties impose a combined 4.712% general excise tax on goods and services including hotel rooms. Together, that will make for a hotel and vacation rental tax rate of nearly 19%.

US companies are poised to boost their debt levels to help fund a $1 trillion wave of acquisitions, a reversal after years of scaling back their borrowings. 

Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. this week said it's buying coffeemaker JDE Peet's NV and funding the deal with a €16.2 billion ($19.0 billion) bridge loan. AT&T Inc. said on Tuesday it's buying spectrum licenses from EchoStar Corp. for about $23 billion, a move that will probably be at least partly funded with bondsBloomberg Terminal.

President Trump's efforts to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook could jeopardize the central bank's independence, according to longtime investor Rebecca Patterson.

"We shouldn't ignore this at all. This is a big deal what's going on," the former Bridgewater Associates chief investment strategist told CNBC's "Fast Money" this week.

Patterson, now a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, has spent more than two decades analyzing how politics and policy shape global markets. She cautions that politicizing the Fed could erode its legitimacy and have long-term economic consequences.

Drawing from her economics research on countries that have lost institutional integrity, Patterson notes a familiar pattern: weaker stock market performances, higher inflation and long-term yields, depreciating currencies, and reduced foreign direct investment.

Patterson warns the United States' unique role as the world's largest economy does not make it immune.

She warns replacing Cook would likely be the Trump's first move to stack the Fed with loyal policymakers who will push for lower rates.

Patterson thinks markets may initially react positively to lower rates. However, she warns the longer-term effects could be damaging.

"In the short-term, investors might reason that lower rates supporting growth are good for earnings," she wrote in a special email to CNBC. "Over time, though, sustained higher inflation is going to hurt consumption which will get reflected in earnings expectations."

If Trump gains greater control over the Fed, she thinks it will steepen the yield curve, boost inflation expectations, weaken the dollar, and spark higher gold prices. 

The question in Patterson's mind isn't whether politicizing the Fed will have consequences — it's when.

"Our moment might not come as quickly or easily," she said during the interview. "But looking at other countries who have gone down this road, [it] tells us where we're headed if we're not careful."

More than a year after the Powerball jackpot last topped $1 billion, the prize has climbed back to that level ahead of Saturday night's drawing at 10:59 p.m. ET.

After 39 drawings without a winner, the $1 billion prize ranks as the sixth-largest jackpot in the game's history, according to the consortium that runs the lottery. The last $1 billion jackpot was claimed in April 2024, and the biggest since then was a $526.5 million win in March.

To claim the prize, you'll need to beat odds of 1 in 292,201,338 and match all six numbers, including the red Powerball. Smaller prizes are also available, including $1 million for matching all five white balls without the Powerball.

Winners can choose between two payout options: the full jackpot spread out as annual payments over 30 years or a lump-sum cash option worth just under half the advertised prize.

No matter which option you select, the Internal Revenue Service takes a cut. Winnings are considered taxable income, so 24% is withheld immediately. But the windfall would almost certainly put you in the top 37% federal tax bracket, so expect to pay the rest when you file your 2025 tax return.

On top of that, most states levy their own income taxes, ranging from 2.5% to 10.9%. Eight states don't tax lottery winnings at all: California, Florida, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming.

It's worth noting that five states don't participate in Powerball: Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Nevada and Utah.

Based on a top federal rate of 37%, here's what the total after-tax payout would look like in each state and Washington, D.C., for both the lump sum and the 30-year annuity, according to USAMega.com.

President Donald Trump's effort to sack Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is about more than firing someone: It's a maneuver that, if successful, would mark a seismic shift for an institution that for ages had been considered above politics.

Since taking office in January, Trump has placed the Fed directly in the crosshairs of executive power. He has berated central bankers for not lowering rates, threatened to remove Chair Jerome Powell, and now has taken the unprecedented step of actually attempting to unseat Cook.

From the president's perspective, he's looking to reform what has been an unpopular institution, often blamed for the runaway inflation that hit the U.S. following the Covid pandemic. Trump sees lower interest rates as a pathway to manage the swelling federal debt while boosting a housing market that has been a counterweight to an otherwise growing economy.

However, legal scholars as well as financial market experts and present and former Fed officials say Trump's moves not only threaten to make the Fed more political but also would undermine key pillars of the American financial system.

"We are on a road that is going to lead to the erosion of central bank independence," said Kathryn Judge, a professor at Columbia Law School. "It would be incredibly costly for the long-term health of the economy for the Fed to lose the credibility that it has spent decades trying to build."

Independence in the Fed's case is a term used to describe its freedom from outside political influence to determine monetary policy that is best for the U.S. economy. This is particularly the case if those decisions are unpopular, such as when the Federal Open Market Committee raises interest rates to bring down inflation.

But there's more at stake than simply the level of the three rates the Fed controls.

Should Trump get a majority of members on the board of governors to vote the way he wants — and the evidence right now, to be sure, is scant that he can ever achieve such a goal — it would give him access to key levers that control the economy as well as the nation's financial infrastructure.

The seven-member Board of Governors, for instance, has regulatory and enforcement power over banks.

Moreover, while the 12-member FOMC sets the key overnight funds interest rate, the governors alone establish the discount rate, used to find the present value of money, and the interest on reserve balances, which pays banks for storing their money at the Fed and also serves as a kind of guardrail for the funds rate.

Finally, the board has control over the reappointments of the 12 regional bank presidents, with a slew of names coming up in 2026.

Embedded within those responsibilities is the Fed's role in ensuring the integrity of the Treasury system and preserving a stable dollar.

In other words, this is about more than just getting a rate cut in September.

"The most serious danger, I think, to people's being able to have confidence in the Fed board is what Trump is himself doing," said Robert Hockett, a professor at Cornell Law School. "Because if Trump succeeds with this, then it suggests the Fed board is nothing but a rubber stamp. It just basically tells us that any nutjob who happens to get into the White House will be setting monetary policy henceforth."

The effect, Hockett added, is that "we can have the same kind of hyperinflations in the future that banana republics in Latin America have classically had when their dictators have set monetary policy, or that Turkey has experienced in recent years because its dictator has set monetary policy."

For the administration's part, Trump's lieutenants largely say they believe in Fed independence but see the central bank as institution run amok that needs reigning in.

However, the president has conceded he will litmus test nominees for board vacancies on their willingness to lower rates, and he in the past has advocated getting a say in the Fed's rate decisions among other measures that might be considered intrusions into the central bank's space.

"I don't think it's an undermining of Fed independence. I just think it's the fact the system needs a wholesale reevaluation and President Trump just does things unconventionally," said Joseph LaVorgna, a senior economist during the first Trump term and now counselor to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. "There definitely has been mission creep on behalf of the Fed getting into climate change and issues of diversity and inclusion and things that certainly go well beyond their mandate."

In fact, the notion that the Fed needs an overhaul has support on Wall Street.

Mohamed El-Erian, the former Pimco executive and now chief economic advisor at Allianz, recently advocated that Powell step down as chair to avoid just the kind of battle over independence that is happening now. Moreover, he said the Fed's own policy mistakes helped precipitate the current battle.

"This is the exact world that I was worried about," El-Erian said Friday on CNBC. "The Fed is vulnerable on so many different fronts, and I fear now that we've started going down this road that I really dread."

Among the reforms El-Erian spoke of included taking after the Bank of England and allowing "external members" onto its policymaking group "that bring a difference perspective and that help reduce the risk of groupthink."

Also, he said the Fed should reconsider its 2% inflation target, something that Powell repeatedly has said is not on the table.

However, critics say that what Trump is talking about goes beyond mere structural reforms.

"This is really a story about trying to undo what had been 90 years of Fed independence," former Fed Vice Chair Roger Ferguson said on CNBC. "The whole goal was to give the Fed independence in doing this very important thing, which is setting monetary policy. And now, for the first time, we're seeing a direct effort to undermine that."

How successful Trump will be in doing so is another matter.

Currently, he has two appointees, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, on the board. Stephen Miran is awaiting Senate confirmation to fill the seat vacated by Adriana Kugler's resignation. Should Powell leave next May when his term as chair runs out, that would create another vacancy and give the president five seats.

However, counting on all those members as automatic votes is risky.

Both Waller and Bowman have shown strong independent streaks, taking both out-of-consensus hawkish and dovish positions depending on circumstances, and are unlikely to be "little apparatchiks for Trump," the Cornell professor Hockett said.

"It's unfair to the sitting governors to assume that they're willing to operate as partisan hacks," added Judge, the Columbia professor.

Also potentially standing in the way is a series of court tests that will focus on whether Trump has "cause" to remove Cook or anyone else.  

If the president succeeds, it could have wide-ranging effects on the economy and markets, said Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI.

"We think the baseline case at this point should be that there is very substantial Trumpification of the Fed through 2026 and – while this does not automatically correspond to a big lurch in policy and practice – we need to very seriously consider the likelihood that this leads to a rupture with past practice and a materially different reaction function with important implications for markets," Guha said in a recent note.

The stakes also are high for the Fed's future as an institution.

"There's never been as dire a threat to Fed independence in our entire history as a republic as there is right now thanks to what Trump is doing," Hockett said. "I do think that long term confidence in our central bank and hence in our currency will take yet another hit."

More companies are recalling tens of thousands of packages of imported shrimp sold at Walmart, Kroger and other U.S. stores because they may contain radioactive contamination, according to federal notices.

AquaStar USA Corp. of Seattle is recalling more than 26,000 packages of refrigerated cocktail shrimp sold at Walmart stores in 27 states between July 31 and Aug. 16. The company is also recalling about 18,000 bags of Kroger-branded cooked, medium peeled, tail-off shrimp sold at stores in 17 states between July 24 and Aug. 11.

At the same time, H&N Group, a wholesale seafood distributor in Vernon, California, is recalling more than 17,000 cases of frozen shrimp sold to grocery stores on the East Coast, according to a notice from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. That recall began on Aug. 12.

The products have been pulled because they may be contaminated with Cesium-137, a radioactive isotope that is a byproduct of nuclear reactions. The risk appears to be small, but the shrimp could pose a "potential health concern" for people exposed to low levels of Cesium-137 over time, FDA officials said.

The FDA issued a safety alert this month warning consumers not to eat certain frozen shrimp imported from PT. Bahari Makmur Sejati, an Indonesian company doing business as BMS Foods. Cesium-137 was detected in shipping containers from the company sent to U.S. ports and in a sample of frozen breaded shrimp.

FDA has also added PT. Bahari Makmur Sejati to a new import alert for chemical contamination to stop products from this firm from coming into the U.S.

It remains unclear how the containers or the shrimp became contaminated. Federal officials said they are investigating and declined to respond to detailed questions from The Associated Press about the source or extent of the contamination.

None of the shrimp that triggered alerts or tested positive for Cesium-137 was released for sale, the FDA said. But other shipments sent to stores may have been manufactured under conditions that allowed the products to become contaminated, the agency said.

Officials with U.S. Customs and Border Protection first detected the potential radioactive contamination in shipping containers sent to U.S. ports in Los Angeles, Houston, Miami and Savannah, Georgia. Customs officials alerted the FDA, which conducted tests of packaged shrimp and confirmed Cesium-137 in a single sample.

Experts in nuclear radiation agreed that the health risk is low, but said it's important to determine the source of the contamination and share that information with the public.

The level of Cesium-137 detected in the frozen shrimp was about 68 becquerels per kilogram, a measure of radioactivity. That is far below the FDA's level of 1,200 becquerels per kilogram that could trigger the need for health protections.

It is unusual to see this concentration of Cesium-137 in shrimp, said Steve Biegalski, who chairs the Nuclear and Radiological Engineering and Medical Physics program at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Routine levels detected in shrimp from the Pacific Ocean are about 100 times lower than those found in the BMS shrimp, according to the American Nuclear Society.

"We sometimes can see Cesium-137 from historic nuclear weapons fallout, nuclear accidents such as Fukushima or Chernobyl, but the levels in the environment are super, super, super low right now and cannot explain what's going on here," Biegalski said.

A federal judge on Friday temporarily blocked the Trump administration from carrying out speedy deportations of undocumented migrants detained in the interior of the United States.

The move is a setback for the Republican administration's efforts to expand the use of the federal expedited removal statute to quickly remove some migrants in the country illegally without appearing before a judge first.

President Donald Trump promised to engineer a massive deportation operation during his 2024 campaign if voters returned him to the White House. And he set a goal of carrying out 1 million deportations a year in his second term.

But U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, D.C., suggested the Trump administration's expanded use of the expedited removal of migrants is trampling on individuals' due process rights.

"In defending this skimpy process, the Government makes a truly startling argument: that those who entered the country illegally are entitled to no process under the Fifth Amendment, but instead must accept whatever grace Congress affords them," Cobb wrote in a 48-page opinion issued Friday night. "Were that right, not only noncitizens, but everyone would be at risk."

The Department of Homeland Security announced shortly after Trump came to office in January that it was expanding the use of expedited removal, the fast-track deportation of undocumented migrants who have been in the U.S. less than two years.

The effort has triggered lawsuits by the American Civil Liberties Union and immigrant rights groups.

Before the Trump administration's push to expand such speedy deportations, expedited removal was only used for migrants who were stopped within 100 miles of the border and who had been in the U.S. for less than 14 days.

Cobb, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, didn't question the constitutionality of the expedited removal statute, or its application at the border.

"It merely holds that in applying the statute to a huge group of people living in the interior of the country who have not previously been subject to expedited removal, the Government must afford them due process," she wrote.

She added that "prioritizing speed over all else will inevitably lead the Government to erroneously remove people via this truncated process."

Cobb earlier this month agreed to temporarily block the Trump administration's efforts to expand fast-track deportations of immigrants who legally entered the U.S. under a process known as humanitarian parole — a ruling that could benefit hundreds of thousands of people.

In that case the judge said Homeland Security exceeded its statutory authority in its effort to expand expedited removal for many immigrants. The judge said those immigrants are facing perils that outweigh any harm from "pressing pause" on the administration's plans.

Since May, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have positioned themselves in hallways to arrest people after judges accept government requests to dismiss deportation cases. After the arrests, the government renews deportation proceedings but under fast-track authority.

Although fast-track deportations can be put on hold by filing an asylum claim, people may be unaware of that right and, even if they are, can be swiftly removed if they fail an initial screening.

Julian Becerra first learned about retatrutide while scrolling social media. The 24-year-old saw Dawson Weiss, a bodybuilder, post unbelievable photos on TikTok — his muscles rippling, his torso concave. Weiss wrote in a caption: "The biggest thing I've noticed since taking retatrutide is the fact that it's a challenge to actually gain fat — not gain weight, but gain body fat."

Becerra ("not a bodybuilder by any means at all, but I do like to look good with my shirt off") bought himself a substance labeled "retatrutide" online, a powder mixed with water, and injected it into his muscles with a syringe, just as Weiss and other bodybuilders online described. For about a month, Becerra injected half a milligram a week. He was sold. He said he lost the urge to snack, but still had energy to work out. Eventually, he started posting his own mirror selfies on his socials. His muscles popped, and the views soared.

Retatrutide is a GLP-1 drug, in the same family as Ozempic (semaglutide) and Mounjaro (tirzepatide). It was developed by the pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, and it is unique because it mimics three hunger hormones (GLP, GIP, and glucagon), while similar drugs on the market target one or two. In theory, that means more staggering weight-loss results and potentially other benefits. Doctors and researchers are already jokingly referring to retatrutide as the "King Kong" for weight loss because early results in clinical trials suggest it rivals bariatric surgery, and it seems to protect more lean muscle mass.

Here's the catch: Eli Lilly has not yet finished clinical trials on retatrutide. The earliest it could hit the market would be late 2026, though it's more likely to drop in 2027. It's widely regarded as a crucial piece in Eli Lilly's strategy for taking the lion's share of the world's $100 billion weight-loss drug industry. Currently, it is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, so doctors can't prescribe it and pharmacies can't sell it.

And yet, over the past year, retatrutide has been gaining traction on TikTok, YouTube, Reddit, and Instagram, particularly in fitness circles. People chasing chiseled physiques buy powder labeled "reta" or "ret" online from research labs, which are legally allowed to manufacture compounds for research only. Their products come with a caveat that they are "not for human consumption."

These consumers appear comfortable mixing their drugs up themselves. They describe reta as a "next-gen" GLP-1 drug, saying the injectable they are taking helped them cut fat and get lean without the muscle wasting that many people experience on Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, or Zepbound. They post eye-popping photos and videos as proof and marvel at the appetite-suppressing power of this new injectable peptide. Reddit threads are filled with questions and advice on which labs to avoid for safety and how to dose the drug depending on your goals. People describe asking ChatGPT to personalize the advice.

This is the next era of the GLP-1 boom. Post-Ozempic, the gray market for unofficial weight loss solutions is taking on a life of its own among people who are highly skeptical of the healthcare institutions normally involved in drugmaking and prescribing.

There are crackdown efforts: The US Food and Drug Administration says people should buy their drugs from licensed pharmacies, with valid prescriptions. A Brookings report earlier this year showed the majority of counterfeit GLP-1s come from wholesale manufacturers in China, outside of US oversight. The FDA is trying to catch knock-off drugs at the border with limited success. TikTok recently started banning videos that promote retatrutide. Doctors say they are warning their patients that they have no idea what they are getting. Unregulated drugs are often inconsistently dosed and have been found to carry contaminants like formaldehyde.

Drugmaker Eli Lilly told Business Insider in a statement that "anyone purporting to sell retatrutide for human use is breaking the law." The company added: "No one should consider taking anything claiming to be retatrutide outside of a Lilly-sponsored clinical trial."

Still, the trend persists. Creators make new profiles, labs fly under the radar. Big pharmaceutical companies, government regulators, and doctors have little power to intervene as people look to DIY their way into new bodies.

Around 2023, GLP-1 knock-offs entered the mainstream via regulated, US-based compounding pharmacies. People couldn't access the brand-name weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Mounjaro because high demand triggered shortages. So they turned to compounders, which have legal discretion to make cheaper versions of approved drugs when access is limited.

That opened Pandora's box. Patients were presented with the option to get their life-changing weight-loss medication for way less than $1,000 a month, side-stepping insurance. Plus, people who weren't eligible for GLP-1 prescriptions because they didn't have diabetes or obesity were able to get their hands on compounded versions through telehealth companies that asked very few questions.

People came to dread the end of the drug shortages, knowing the FDA and pharma companies could then crack down on their beloved compounded dupes.

Cue research labs. Unlike compounding pharmacies, they exist outside the realm of pharmaceutical regulation. Because they're not making products for human consumption, they're not subject to rules about what they can offer and when, based on shortages, drug approvals, or patent status.

The practice took off in the summer of 2024. Anecdotal evidence suggests websites selling research peptides were increasingly catering to gymgoers, selling peptides that promise to tan skin, curb hair loss, and — yes — cut fat. There was an extremely low bar to entry: See a video, click a Linktree, get the product. Some sites offer the bacteriostatic water and syringes people need to mix their own dosages at home. It's a lot like shopping on Amazon, if a bit more chemically technical.

Mr. Olympia competitor Nick "The Mutant" Walker posted about retatrutide earlier this year, saying he had tried it out before a couple of big bodybuilding shows and it worked "tremendously" to shred fat. (He won the men's open division of the New York Pro 2025 bodybuilding competition in May.) Derek Munro, the bodybuilder who produces the podcast "More Plates More Dates" and has appeared on Joe Rogan's podcast, was another early pioneer.

Max Radovanic lost 230 pounds over a period of about two and a half years, first by dieting, then with assistance from semaglutide and retatrutide. He first heard about reta from Munro, a few months after his insurance kicked him off his semaglutide pill, Rybelsus. He said he no longer qualified for the drug because he'd successfully lost more weight and controlled food noise using it. That was frustrating, and the 22-year-old panicked, worried about a rebound. With a few clicks on a peptide website, he said he was able to find compounded semaglutide and then retatrutide.

He was so enamored with his own results, he started selling reta. He buys medications in bulk from a research lab online. Then, out of a warehouse in Colorado, he packs and sells various blends and "stacks" — combinations of peptides, including GLP-1s, that purportedly offer different benefits for muscle growth, healing, and weight-loss. It's all labeled for "research use only." Alongside reta, he lists another not-yet-for-sale drug from Novo Nordisk, called cagrilintide, or cagri, and a popular concoction: cagri-reta, blending two in-development GLP-1s from two different drugmakers. In just a few months, Radovanic says he's amassed thousands of customers across North America.

Radovanic isn't alone. Becerra, the 24-year-old mentioned earlier, is passionate about optimizing men's hormones, as part of a bigger quest to boost testosterone, masculinity, and male self-confidence.

After buying and trying the drug himself, he saw the potential. He teamed up with a friend to cofound Overtime Men's Health in Tampa, Florida, joining the blossoming industry of men's health clinics. They source retatrutide from a compounder's "sister company" that is "in place because of the FDA restrictions," Becerra said. They sell it online alongside a smorgasbord of products that promise to nourish masculinity — testosterone, creatine, and peptides like BPC-157.

The groups that oversee compounding in the US, the Alliance for Pharmacy Compounding and the Outsourcing Facilities Association, told Business Insider that anyone getting retatrutide from a clinic or a lab should know that it is not compounded or regulated. They said compounding pharmacies play no role in this trade since retatrutide is not an approved drug.

Novo Nordisk, the company behind Ozempic, told Business Insider: "Attempts by compounders to evade the law or abuse so-called 'grey-areas' are not in the best of interests of patients as well as undermine the US supply chain, US manufacturing and US jobs."

In February, 38 state Attorneys General asked the FDA to "stop the bad conduct" by counterfeit drugmakers. The FDA told Business Insider in a statement that it is "actively working" to protect consumers from counterfeit GLP-1s through "public awareness, enforcement actions, and collaboration with other agencies."

Last spring, FDA Special Agents worked with the Department of Justice to arrest a woman in New York for selling fake Ozempic and pressed charges against a doctor in Kentucky who was selling "lab research" semaglutide, calling it "Meal Prep" in Venmo payments. The FDA also said it has been working with Customs and Border Protection, "intercepting illegal products at ports." Business Insider has seen photographs of stashes of semaglutide hidden inside bags of kitty litter and antiaging face masks from China.

The FDA is unequivocal that "retatrutide and cagrilintide cannot be used in compounding under federal law."

"These are not components of FDA-approved drugs and have not been found safe and effective for any condition," the agency said in drug safety information posted online.

Retatrutide fans say it helps you shred fat and gives you energy to build muscle. They invariably claim it's better than Ozempic; fewer side effects, better results. They tout improved insulin sensitivity, nodding to the drug's original purpose, which is to help control blood sugar for patients with type 2 diabetes.

There is some early evidence from clinical trials that at least some of this is true. Studies conducted on patients with obesity and diabetes suggest that retatrutide may be better at zeroing in on fat, preserving more lean muscle mass than earlier generations of injectable GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Mounjaro. Patients in the clinical trials, who all have diabetes and/or obesity, also had fewer complaints about nausea and diarrhea.

"What's interesting about it is people don't just lose weight and reach a plateau, they just keep losing weight," Dr. Eric Topol, a cardiologist and leading longevity expert, told Business Insider after looking at Eli Lilly's clinical trial results. "I joke that it goes skeletal because it's so incredibly potent." (Topol is not affiliated with Lilly's clinical trials.)

We know less about research-lab ret.

The Brookings Institution, a research think tank, published a report in April on research labs selling counterfeit GLP-1s to Americans. It found just two European labs, with the bulk of peptide shipments pouring in from Chinese factories to distributors in the US. Business Insider could not independently verify how many research labs are producing reta and where they are based.

Exactly how those labs manufacture these copycat drugs is a bit of a mystery. The amino acid formula for retatrutide is easily searchable on the internet, but how easy is it to manufacture that chemistry? The Brookings report found that counterfeit versions of semaglutide are not perfect copies of what Novo Nordisk manufactures, which is more like a natural hormone. The copies are manufactured using "solid state" peptide synthesis, and some have had contaminants like formaldehyde left inside.

A whole cottage industry is springing up to test these research compounds. Serial investor Michael Carter, who has founded and run various gaming and software startups, recently started a company called Finrick, which he says is "creating the market force for these vendors to care about safety." He said most of the retatrutide samples he has tested are the real deal, the "exact same thing" that Eli Lilly is making, but there's really no way to be totally sure. However, Carter said the dosages are not always consistent from one batch to the next, even when they are labeled the same.

Doctors say that we need to learn more about the safety profile of these drugs and better understand the possible dangers for each patient, depending on their medical history. We saw with the first wave of GLP-1 drugs that some people had unpredictable reactions to Ozempic or Mounjaro, with life-altering side effects like stomach paralysis and sudden blindness.

There is, of course, a serious risk of contamination and bacterial infection when you're getting powder from an online clinic that isn't subject to regulations. Plus, there's the contamination risk of mixing things up on your own, outside the clean rooms that pharma normally uses.

Reta fans know this. "I got burned with fake reta again," is a common refrain in TikTok videos and Reddit forums. People pile in, offering names of labs they trust.

Business Insider reached out to some of the most popular labs cited on social media, but we didn't receive a response.

"This is not kid stuff," Topol said. "To be able to get this, if indeed that's what it is — who knows what it really is."

At the popular testosterone and hormone clinic Gameday Men's Health, chief medical officer Dr. Haleem Mohammed said he's been seeing a consistent stream of guys coming in who are taking "ret."

"Let's toss that vial and wait until it's gone through the trials and is available," Mohammed told his Miami patients. "The risk profile, efficacy profile needs to be proven first before you start taking these."

As someone who's lost 70 pounds on the injectable weight loss drug tirzepatide, he said he's sympathetic to the ambition and excitement these guys have for the field. He's also frustrated by how quickly and easily they can get research chemicals online that don't have the same safety checks that any pharmacy would require.

"Unless you're a lab rat, or planning on being one, I wouldn't recommend it," Mohammed said. He's seen issues with malnutrition in people taking these research peptides and electrolyte imbalances that could eventually lead to dangerous heart issues, if left unaddressed.

"You get a vial in the mail and you have no idea what's in there and there's no clinician involved whatsoever," he said. "That's what I'm educating against, constantly."

Dr. Christle Guevarra, a licensed physician and powerlifter who works with bodybuilders and fitness enthusiasts at RP Strength, started hearing about retatrutide about six months ago. Some of her patients are open with her about taking reta and other gray market GLP-1 drugs. She said she discourages them from using retatrutide — she worries about contamination and all the unknowns that come with an unapproved drug — but tries to meet patients where they are to reduce harm.

"I can't gate-keep people from going to find information," Guevarra told Business Insider. "You have forums that are everywhere." Some bodybuilders (controversially) take insulin, an anabolic hormone, in the hopes of building muscle and improving nutrient uptake in their muscles. Guevarra knows they're going to do it, and she wants to do everything she can to help them understand the serious risks.

"I think it really is important now more than ever that we figure out a way to do a better job as physicians to check in on things like side effects, on things like muscle loss, on things like, 'how are your lifestyle changes going?' to make sure that our patients are safe," Guevarra said.

That retatrutide is booming before it's even on the market underscores the huge demand for muscle preservation to go with weight loss.

Doctors have been raising concerns for years that, while GLP-1 drugs have myriad benefits, they trigger such rapid weight loss that it's hard to preserve muscle or even have the energy to work out. That's bad news for long-term health. You need muscle mass to protect your joints, stave off osteoporosis, and keep you energetic as you age. Less muscle can also, ironically, impact your metabolism, affecting digestion and making it harder to stay at a stable weight.

At least 10 biotech companies are racing to meet that need, developing therapies designed to preserve muscle mass in GLP-1 patients. Analysts project that muscle-preserving drugs could generate $30 billion by 2035.

In the meantime, there's a gap, and a world of fitness influencers and online clinics flooding in to fill it, offering advice on how to build muscle.

Private wellness clinics offer pricey body composition scans to gauge a person's muscle-fat ratio — far too costly for a physician to universally recommend and not deemed essential by insurance. Depending on your results, you may look for weight training or diet tweaks, or supplements. Back home, scrolling online, you may come across a buzzy new GLP-1 that costs $100 for a month's supply, and supposedly preserves muscle while melting fat. People selling it on TikTok show you PDFs of test results ostensibly proving it is safe to use. You find hundreds of other social media creators who say it changed their lives. Would you try it?

Take Radovanic, who experienced incredible weight loss on a brand-name GLP-1, then lost insurance coverage for the drug as a result. He found solace and inspiration on TikTok, opening the door to a cheaper drug that he believes in.

Social media companies are trying to crack down. Earlier this week, TikTok banned the words "ret," "reta," and "retatrutide" from search, pointing to its community guidelines, which ban dangerous weight loss behaviors and marketing of weight loss products.

It wasn't a huge problem for creators. They started posting about "redatrutide" instead, some mocking the censorship as "big pharma's" latest intervention.

The global online safety movement has paved the way for a number of artificial intelligence-powered products designed to keep kids away from potentially harmful things on the internet.

In the U.K., a new piece of legislation called the Online Safety Act imposes a duty of care on tech companies to protect children from age-inappropriate material, hate speech, bullying, fraud, and child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Companies can face fines as high as 10% of their global annual revenue for breaches.

Further afield, landmark regulations aimed at keeping kids safer online are swiftly making their way through the U.S. Congress. One bill, known as the Kids Online Safety Act, would make social media platforms liable for preventing their products from harming children — similar to the Online Safety Act in the U.K.

This push from regulators is increasingly causing something of a rethink at several major tech players. Pornhub and other online pornography giants are blocking all users from accessing their sites unless they go through an age verification system.

Porn sites haven't been alone in taking action to verify users ages, though. Spotify, Reddit and X have all implemented age assurance systems to prevent children from being exposed to sexually explicit or inappropriate materials.

Such regulatory measures have been met with criticisms from the tech industry — not least due to concerns that they may infringe internet users' privacy.

At the heart of all these age verification measures is one company: Yoti.

Yoti produces technology that captures selfies and uses artificial intelligence to verify someone's age based on their facial features. The firm says its AI algorithm, which has been trained on millions of faces, can estimate the age of 13 to 24-year-olds within two years of accuracy.

The firm has previously partnered with the U.K.'s Post Office and is hoping to capitalize on the broader push for government-issued digital ID cards in the U.K. Yoti is not alone in the identity verification software space — other players include Entrust, Persona and iProov. However, the company has been the most prominent provider of age assurance services under the new U.K. regime.

"There is a race on for child safety technology and service providers to earn trust and confidence," Pete Kenyon, a partner at law firm Cripps, told CNBC. "The new requirements have undoubtedly created a new marketplace and providers are scrambling to make their mark."

Yet the rise of digital identification methods has also led to concerns over privacy infringements and possible data breaches.

"Substantial privacy issues arise with this technology being used," said Kenyon. "Trust is key and will only be earned by the use of stringent and effective technical and governance procedures adopted in order to keep personal data safe."

Rani Govender, policy manager for child safety online at British child protection charity NSPCC, said that the technology "already exists" to authenticate users without compromising their privacy.

"Tech companies must make deliberate, ethical choices by choosing solutions that protect children from harm without compromising the privacy of users," she told CNBC. "The best technology doesn't just tick boxes; it builds trust."

The wave of new tech emerging to prevent children from being exposed to online harms isn't just limited to software.

Earlier this month, Finnish phone maker HMD Global launched a new smartphone called the Fusion X1, which uses AI to stop kids from filming or sharing nude content or viewing sexually explicit images from the camera, screen and across all apps.

The phone uses technology developed by SafeToNet, a British cybersecurity firm focused on child safety.

"We believe more needs to be done in this space," James Robinson, vice president of family vertical at HMD, told CNBC. He stressed that HMD came up with the concept for children's devices prior to the Online Safety Act entering into force, but noted it was "great to see the government taking greater steps."

The release of HMD's child-friendly phone follows heightened momentum in the "smartphone-free" movement, which encourages parents to avoid letting their children own a smartphone.

Going forward, the NSPCC's Govender says that child safety will become a significant priority for digital behemoths such as Google and Meta.

The tech giants have for years been accused of worsening mental health in children and teens due to the rise of online bullying and social media addiction. They in return argue they've taken steps to address these issues through increased parental controls and privacy features.

"For years, tech giants have stood by while harmful and illegal content spread across their platforms, leaving young people exposed and vulnerable," she told CNBC. "That era of neglect must end."

Decoding blockchain innovations and market trends with clarity and precision.

- Tether halts USDT freezes on legacy blockchains (Omni, BCH SLP, etc.) to prioritize operational efficiency and user retention in 2025.

- Tron dominates 51% of USDT liquidity ($73B) with low-cost transactions, while Ethereum leverages upgrades to strengthen DeFi infrastructure.

- Bitcoin's RGB-enabled USDT integration ($167B liquidity) repositions it as a scalable payments layer, challenging its store-of-value narrative.

- Regulatory risks (GENIUS Act, MiCAR) and network upgrades (Tron's Kant, Ethereum staking yields) will shape capital allocation in the evolving stablecoin ecosystem.

 

Tether's 2025 decision to abandon USDT freezes on legacy blockchains—Omni Layer, Bitcoin Cash SLP, Kusama, EOS, and Algorand—reflects a broader recalibration of capital allocation and operational efficiency in the stablecoin market. By maintaining transferability of existing tokens while ceasing new issuance and redemption, Tether has prioritized user retention and reputational stability over abrupt disruptions [1]. This strategic pivot underscores a market-wide shift toward blockchain networks with robust developer activity, scalability, and high user demand, such as Ethereum and Tron [2].  

The implications for investors are profound. Tron, for instance, has emerged as a dominant force in USDT liquidity, with its supply surpassing Ethereum's in Q2 2025. Tron's $73 billion in USDT—accounting for 51% of global circulation—highlights its cost efficiency and fast transaction speeds, which have attracted institutional and retail capital [3]. Meanwhile, Ethereum's recent $1 billion USDT mint underscores its role as a foundational layer for DeFi, leveraging upgrades like Pectra and Dencun to enhance scalability [4]. These developments signal a structural realignment: investors must now weigh the trade-offs between Tron's low-cost, high-volume model and Ethereum's deflationary supply dynamics and institutional adoption.  

Bitcoin's integration of USDT via the RGB protocol further complicates the landscape. By enabling fast, private, and scalable transactions on Bitcoin's infrastructure, Tether has positioned the network as a global payments layer, with $167 billion in liquidity potentially boosting cross-border remittances and DeFi applications [5]. This innovation challenges Bitcoin's traditional store-of-value narrative, aligning it with capital-efficient use cases that could attract institutional participation [6].  

 

For investors, the long-term value shift toward supported, scalable chains is clear. Tether's Q2 2025 profits of $4.9 billion and 68% stablecoin market share demonstrate its ability to sustain dominance while adapting to regulatory and technological pressures [7]. However, challenges remain: regulatory scrutiny, particularly under the U.S. GENIUS Act and Europe's MiCAR, could disrupt liquidity flows [8]. Investors should also monitor Tron's Kant mainnet upgrade and Ethereum's staking yields (3.8%) as indicators of sustained capital allocation [9].  

In conclusion, Tether's strategic shift reflects a market prioritizing operational efficiency and scalability. While Tron and Ethereum are currently the beneficiaries, Bitcoin's RGB-enabled USDT integration signals a potential third pillar in the stablecoin ecosystem. Investors must remain agile, balancing short-term gains with long-term risks in a rapidly evolving landscape.

Stablecoins are changing the way we think about money. Unlike traditional credit cards or bank accounts, these digital currencies are fast, low-cost, and accessible worldwide. Whether sending remittances, shopping online, or managing personal finances, stablecoins offer a simpler, more efficient way to move money—without the usual banking delays or high fees.

抱歉，發生錯誤

We recently published 10 Stocks Skyrocket While Wall Street Sinks; 5 Quietly Hit New Record Highs. Cipher Mining Inc. (NASDAQ:CIFR) is one of the top performers on Friday.

Cipher Mining soared to a new all-time high on Friday, as investor sentiment was bolstered by the growing interest in Bitcoin.

At intra-day trading, Cipher Mining Inc. (NASDAQ:CIFR) surged to a new high of $8.10 before paring gains to end the day just up by 8.83 percent at $7.64 apiece.

This followed a flurry of positive developments across the sector, including increased Bitcoin adoption as evidenced by a growing number of cryptocurrency treasuries, as well as market clarity backed by regulatory frameworks from none other than the US government.

The latest development, while not directly related to Cipher Mining Inc. (NASDAQ:CIFR), was the establishment of a new Bitcoin mining company by the two sons of President Donald Trump.

In other news, Cipher Mining Inc. (NASDAQ:CIFR) announced that investment firm V3 Holding Ltd.—one of its largest shareholders—disposed of shares worth $8.3 million in its stock between August 26 and 27, at average prices of $6.81 and $7.07, respectively.

Despite the sale, V3 Holding Ltd.'s ownership in Cipher Mining Inc. (NASDAQ:CIFR) remained at 89.7 million.

Cipher Mining Inc. (NASDAQ:CIFR) tripled its net loss in the second quarter of the year to $45.78 million from only $15.29 million in the same period last year. Revenues grew by 18.37 percent to $43.56 million from $36.8 million year-on-year.

Looking ahead, Cipher Mining Inc. (NASDAQ:CIFR) appeared more optimistic about its growth outlook following the commencement of hashing at its Black Pearl Phase 1 ahead of schedule. It said it expects the site to be fully leased by high-performance computing tenants.

While we acknowledge the potential of CIFR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk. If you are looking for an extremely cheap AI stock that is also a major beneficiary of Trump tariffs and onshoring, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.

- Sharps Technology's $400M Solana treasury initiative blends equity appreciation with 7% staking yields, creating a dual-income model for institutional crypto exposure.

- The company secured a 15% discount on $50M SOL via a non-binding LOI with Solana Foundation, aligning its growth with the blockchain's energy efficiency and transaction throughput.

- Institutional ownership at 17.17% and backing from crypto-native firms like ParaFi validate the strategy, which simplifies regulatory complexity through equity-based crypto access.

- Appointment of Web3 expert Alice Zhang as CIO reinforces Sharps' commitment to scaling Solana holdings while maintaining operational discipline in its medical device core.

- This hybrid model mirrors MicroStrategy's Bitcoin strategy but leverages Solana's institutional traction, positioning Sharps as a bellwether for traditional-finance crypto integration.

 

The institutionalization of crypto markets has reached a pivotal inflection point, marked by innovative onramps that blend traditional equity structures with digital asset strategies. Sharps Technology's $400 million Solana (SOL) treasury initiative exemplifies this trend, offering a compelling case study in how public companies can serve as vehicles for institutional-grade crypto exposure. By leveraging its medical device distribution business as a stable foundation, Sharps has transformed into a dual-income model that combines equity appreciation with high-yield staking returns, all while mitigating the volatility risks typically associated with direct crypto ownership [1].  

The strategic rationale behind Sharps' pivot is rooted in Solana's unique value proposition. The blockchain's 7% staking yields, coupled with its high transaction throughput and energy efficiency, position it as a superior alternative to Bitcoin and Ethereum for institutional treasuries [3]. Sharps further strengthened its position by securing a non-binding letter of intent (LOI) with the Solana Foundation to purchase $50 million of SOL at a 15% discount to the 30-day time-weighted average price. This structural advantage not only reduces acquisition costs but also aligns the company's interests with Solana's long-term ecosystem growth [1].  

Institutional adoption metrics underscore the credibility of this strategy. Over the past 12 months, Sharps has attracted $113.66 million in institutional investments, with ownership concentrated among firms like Essential Planning LLC and Altium Capital Management. Notably, institutional ownership of Sharps' stock now stands at 17.17%, reflecting confidence in its dual-income model [3]. Prominent crypto-native investors, including ParaFi, Pantera, and FalconX, have also participated in the company's private placement, signaling a broader acceptance of institutional-grade crypto onramps through traditional equity vehicles [1].  

The appointment of Alice Zhang, co-founder of Web3 startup Jambo, as Chief Investment Officer further validates Sharps' commitment to institutional-grade execution. Zhang's expertise in Web3 infrastructure and treasury management aligns with the company's goal of scaling its Solana holdings while maintaining operational discipline in its core medical device business [2]. This hybrid approach—balancing a stable revenue stream with speculative but strategically grounded crypto exposure—mirrors the playbook of MicroStrategy for Bitcoin but adapts it to Solana's institutional traction and technical advantages [1].  

Critically, Sharps' model addresses a key barrier to crypto adoption: regulatory and operational complexity. By structuring its treasury through a publicly traded equity, the company provides institutional investors with a familiar framework to access crypto markets without navigating the compliance challenges of direct token ownership. This “equity proxy” strategy democratizes institutional-grade crypto exposure, enabling a broader range of investors to participate in blockchain innovation while adhering to fiduciary standards [4].  

As the crypto market matures, the success of Sharps' Solana treasury will hinge on its ability to balance growth in digital asset holdings with financial prudence. However, the current trajectory—marked by robust institutional backing, strategic discounts, and a dual-income model—positions the company as a bellwether for the next phase of institutional crypto adoption. For investors, this represents not just a bet on Solana's ecosystem but a vote of confidence in the evolving intersection of traditional finance and blockchain technology.

Decoding blockchain innovations and market trends with clarity and precision.

- Sharps Technology raised $400M to build the largest institutional-grade Solana (SOL) treasury, leveraging a 15% discount from the Solana Foundation.

- The strategy aligns with Solana's high throughput, low fees, and 7% staking yields, offering institutional investors indirect crypto exposure through transparent reporting.

- This model could redefine corporate treasury management by treating digital assets as core balance sheet components, though regulatory risks and price volatility remain concerns.

 

The corporate world is witnessing a seismic shift as traditional firms pivot to embrace blockchain technology. Sharps Technology, Inc. (STSS) has emerged as a pivotal player in this transformation, leveraging its recent $400 million private placement to establish what it claims will be the largest institutional-grade Solana (SOL) digital asset treasury [1]. This move not only redefines Sharps' business model but also introduces a novel framework for institutional investors seeking exposure to Solana's ecosystem. By analyzing the mechanics of this strategy, its alignment with Solana's technical strengths, and the broader implications for institutional adoption, we can assess whether Sharps represents a scalable model for crypto integration in traditional finance.  

Sharps' $400 million raise, priced at $6.50 per unit with stapled warrants exercisable at $9.75 over three years, underscores a calculated approach to capital deployment [2]. The proceeds are earmarked for acquiring SOL in the open market, with a non-binding agreement with the Solana Foundation to purchase $50 million in SOL at a 15% discount to the 30-day time-weighted average price [1]. This discount significantly reduces acquisition costs, enhancing Sharps' ability to scale its treasury while maintaining a buffer against short-term volatility. The participation of institutional heavyweights like ParaFi, Pantera, and FalconX further validates the strategy's credibility, signaling confidence in Solana's institutional-grade infrastructure [3].  

Solana's technical attributes—high throughput, low-cost transactions, and 7% staking yields—position it as a compelling alternative to Ethereum and Bitcoin for institutional treasuries [4]. Sharps' decision to anchor its strategy on Solana reflects a strategic alignment with these strengths. By maintaining transparency through regular reporting on SOL holdings and performance metrics, Sharps offers a public vehicle for investors to gain indirect exposure to Solana without the complexities of direct crypto custody [5]. This model could democratize access to Solana's ecosystem, particularly for investors wary of the operational risks associated with holding digital assets.  

 

Sharps' pivot highlights a growing trend: corporations leveraging blockchain technology to diversify treasuries and generate yield. By treating digital assets as a core component of its balance sheet, Sharps challenges traditional notions of corporate liquidity management [6]. This approach could catalyze a wave of similar strategies, particularly in sectors with stable cash flows, such as healthcare (Sharps' core business) and logistics. Moreover, the company's collaboration with entities like Monarq and ParaFi signals a maturing infrastructure for institutional-grade crypto operations, reducing barriers to entry for other firms [1].  

While the strategy is ambitious, it is not without risks. Regulatory scrutiny of corporate crypto holdings remains a wildcard, and Solana's price volatility could impact Sharps' financial stability. Additionally, the success of the Solana Foundation's $50 million discount hinges on market conditions and execution timing [2]. Investors must also weigh the dilution risks associated with the warrants, which could reduce per-share value if exercised en masse.  

Sharps Technology's strategic shift to Solana represents more than a corporate rebrand—it is a blueprint for institutional crypto adoption. By combining capital efficiency, institutional partnerships, and Solana's technical advantages, Sharps has positioned itself as a public proxy for the blockchain's potential. If successful, this model could redefine how corporations and investors approach digital assets, accelerating the integration of blockchain into mainstream finance.

Oops, something went wrong

The cryptocurrency market has just flashed a short-term bear signal, according to VanEck Head of Digital Assets Research Matthew Sigel.

Sigel said Tuesday on X that Bitcoin and Ethereum had formed a "rare divergence" as ETH did not mirror BTC's over 10% drawdown on the day. He said it was the first time the divergence had occurred since 2021, adding that since 2020, the setup had occurred on just 52 out of 1,927 days.

Sigel said that, on average, Bitcoin has experienced a 2.8% decline the week after the divergence and a 15.6% decline the month after. On the other hand, Ethereum has, on average, experienced a 6.4% increase one week after and an 8.4% decline one month after, he said.

"A bearish flag for crypto overall: ETH cushions short-term, but both tend to roll over," he said.

When one user suggested that the recent divergence could be an outlier and that Bitcoin and Ethereum could both rise, Sigel said it was "possible," but maintained that "history tilts bearish."

The divergence between Bitcoin and Ethereum comes as the cryptocurrency market has faced significant volatility over the past week, with BTC oscillating between $117,000 and $110,000. MEXC Ventures Investment Director Leo Zhao attributed the recent price swings to thinning liquidity, exchange-traded fund rebalancing and heavy profit-taking from OG Bitcoin holders in a Tuesday note shared with Benzinga.

"In the absence of a fresh macro catalyst, such as a dovish FED policy pivot, rate cuts, or renewed ETF inflows, BTC is likely to drift into a period of market consolidation as the market digests the recent distribution," he said. "The long-term picture, however, remains underpinned by institutional accumulation, which continues to outpace new supply, suggesting that once the risk-averse approach wears off and macro uncertainty headwinds subside, Bitcoin retains the structural foundation for another attempt at record highs of $130,000 before the EOY."

But while Zhao remains optimistic in the long term, veteran commodities trader Peter Brandt warned Wednesday on X that Bitcoin could be forming a cycle top. Brandt cited the sale of 24,000 BTC by a single whale, which rocked the market over the weekend, as a sign of distribution.

"Most of you crypto nerds know about the huge sell order that came into the $BTC market over the weekend," he said. "Some of you discount it as unimportant. I am not so quick to judge that. It represented SUPPLY. Tops in markets are created by SUPPLY or DISTRIBUTION."

Brandt said Bitcoin needed to break above $117,570 to invalidate the double-top formation that appears to have been forming on the daily candle chart over the past seven weeks. The asset is currently trading just above $111,000.

River says companies are taking in far more bitcoin each day than miners create.

The U.S.-based bitcoin financial services firm, which runs brokerage and mining operations and publishes research, released a Sankey-style flow infographic dated Aug. 25 in a post on X. In this layout, outflows are shown on the left, inflows on the right, and the thickness of each line represents the size of the net daily movement.

River defines “businesses” broadly. The category combines bitcoin treasury companies — firms such as Strategy that publicly hold BTC — with conventional companies that keep bitcoin on their balance sheets. Based on public filings, custodial address tagging and its own heuristics, River estimates that about 1,755 BTC per day flow into business-controlled wallets.

By comparison, River calculates new miner supply at about 450 BTC per day in 2025. That figure reflects the April 2024 halving, which cut the block subsidy to 3.125 BTC per block. 

With bitcoin blocks averaging one every 10 minutes — about 144 per day — the result is roughly 450 BTC in new issuance daily, though the exact number fluctuates slightly as block times vary.

That math is the basis for River's claim that companies are absorbing bitcoin at nearly four times the rate it is mined.

The infographic shows other large institutional inflows as well. 

Funds and ETFs account for about 1,430 BTC/day in net inflows, which further boosts total absorption compared with new issuance. Smaller streams go to “other” entities (about 411 BTC/day) and governments (about 39 BTC/day). 

River also records a small but steady flow into “lost bitcoin” (about 14 BTC/day), representing coins that the firm judges to be permanently inaccessible, such as through key loss.

On the other side of the ledger, individuals appear as the largest net outflow at about –3,196 BTC/day. River stresses that this does not necessarily mean retail investors are dumping coins. Rather, it reflects bitcoin moving from addresses the firm classifies as individual-held into those it tags as institutional.

River says the takeaway is simple: when inflows to businesses and funds exceed new issuance from miners, available supply tightens. Still, the firm cautions that the infographic should be read carefully.

First, the figures are estimates, not an exact census of the blockchain. 

River relies on a mix of wallet tagging, public disclosures and external databases, which may miss some holdings or misclassify certain addresses. Second, net inflows do not always equal direct spot buying. A business wallet showing +1,755 BTC per day could reflect OTC transactions, custodial transfers or treasury reshuffling, not just exchange purchases.

For readers unfamiliar with flow diagrams, the point is this: the lines show where coins are ending up on balance, not every trade or transfer in the system. If more coins consistently end up in business, fund and government wallets than miners are producing, River argues that institutions are tightening supply at the margin.

River's snapshot is not a price forecast, but it illustrates how ownership patterns may be shifting. If businesses and funds continue to absorb more than miners produce, the firm argues, institutions could play a larger role in shaping bitcoin's supply dynamics.

River also records a small but steady flow into “lost bitcoin” (about 14 BTC/day), representing coins that the firm judges to be permanently inaccessible, such as through key loss.

On the other side of the ledger, individuals appear as the largest net outflow at about –3,196 BTC/day. River stresses that this does not necessarily mean retail investors are dumping coins. Rather, it reflects bitcoin moving from addresses the firm classifies as individual-held into those it tags as institutional.

River says the takeaway is simple: when inflows to businesses and funds exceed new issuance from miners, available supply tightens. Still, the firm cautions that the infographic should be read carefully.

First, the figures are estimates, not an exact census of the blockchain. 

River relies on a mix of wallet tagging, public disclosures and external databases, which may miss some holdings or misclassify certain addresses. Second, net inflows do not always equal direct spot buying. A business wallet showing +1,755 BTC per day could reflect OTC transactions, custodial transfers or treasury reshuffling, not just exchange purchases.

For readers unfamiliar with flow diagrams, the point is this: the lines show where coins are ending up on balance, not every trade or transfer in the system. If more coins consistently end up in business, fund and government wallets than miners are producing, River argues that institutions are tightening supply at the margin.

River's snapshot is not a price forecast, but it illustrates how ownership patterns may be shifting. If businesses and funds continue to absorb more than miners produce, the firm argues, institutions could play a larger role in shaping bitcoin's supply dynamics.

A deluge of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could hit U.S. markets as early as this fall, potentially changing how both institutional and retail investors access the digital asset space. But while some see it as a turning point for mainstream adoption, others are already bracing for inevitable casualties.



“The crypto ETF floodgates are set to open this fall, and investors will soon be swimming in these products,” said Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management. He believes most of the 90-plus crypto ETF applications currently filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will be approved — assuming they meet the final listing requirements.



Ultimately, though, said Geraci, investors — not regulators — will decide which products thrive.



“The beautiful aspect of the ETF market is that it's a meritocracy, where investors vote with their hard-earned money. The market naturally sorts out the winners from the losers, so I'm not overly concerned about there being too many crypto ETFs floating around.”



To Geraci, the demand for more diverse and accessible investment options is already there — and underappreciated.



“Given the initial response to futures-based and 1940 Act-structured Solana and XRP ETFs, I believe demand for 1933 Act spot products in these crypto assets is being severely underestimated – much like we saw with spot bitcoin and ether ETFs,” he said.



The iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), managed and issued by BlackRock, became the most successful ETF launch in the history of those vehicles, now holding nearly $85 billion worth of bitcoin on behalf of investors.



While the ether ETFs initially saw much smaller demand than their bitcoin counterparts, a recent surge in interest in the Ethereum blockchain's native token has seen inflows for the group well surpass those for bitcoin ETFs.



Ether ETFs have taken in nearly $10 billion since the start of July, which represents the bulk of total inflows of $14 billion since their launch last year, according to James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.

Geraci also anticipates strong uptake for index-based crypto ETFs, which he says will give investors and advisors “a straightforward way to gain exposure to the broader digital asset ecosystem.” For smaller, less-known tokens, he admits demand will depend heavily on the strength of each project's fundamentals.



“As you move further down the crypto market cap spectrum, I expect demand for spot ETFs will be more closely tied to the success of individual projects and the performance of their underlying assets — factors that are difficult to forecast at this stage,” he said.



Seyffart agrees that the pipeline of crypto-related products is about to burst — but he's more skeptical about how many will stick.



“If all of those filings ultimately launch, there will undoubtedly be some closures within the next few years,” Seyffart said. He expects “decent demand for plenty of these products,” but believes expectations need to be calibrated—especially for altcoins.



“I'm not sure that some of these longer tail altcoins will be able to have 5+ successful ETFs,” he said. “If people are gauging their success on the level of bitcoin ETFs — they will be severely disappointed. But if others are expecting all of them to fail — they will also be severely disappointed.”



In his view, the market is entering a test phase where issuers will throw many products at the wall to see what sticks. “These issuers are gonna launch a lot of products and try to find something that sticks,” Seyffart said. He predicts the next 12 to 18 months will see “hundreds of crypto-related ETP launches.”



Both analysts agree on a central point: the ETF format creates a highly competitive landscape where investor interest is the ultimate arbiter of success. While SEC approval might open the gates, it's asset flows that will determine who stays afloat.



In the ETF world, product closures are a feature — not a flaw. Just like in the stock market, low demand or poor performance can lead funds to shut down. For investors, that means not every new crypto ETF will be worth betting on, even if it carries the name of a popular blockchain project.



For example, a Solana ETF might find buyers if the underlying token continues to attract developers and users. But five separate ETFs based on the same coin? That's where both Seyffart and Geraci say the market will likely intervene.



“If demand doesn't show up, those products will close,” Seyffart said.



Behind this boom is the broader institutional acceptance of crypto. Since the SEC approved spot bitcoin and ether ETFs last year, asset managers have rushed to file new offerings tied to Solana SOL$201.24, XRP, dogecoin DOGE$0.2156 and many others and even basket funds tracking multiple coins. These products give traditional investors a regulated way to access crypto markets without setting up wallets or managing private keys.



But with that access comes the responsibility to be discerning.



“In the end, investors will decide which products make sense and which don't,” Geraci said. “That's how the ETF market has always worked.”



And with hundreds of crypto funds potentially hitting the market soon, that decision may need to come quickly.

                            New platforms seek to scale blockchain payments. Fu Ding/Beijing Youth Daily/VCG via Getty Images.                        

For years, Ripple has positioned its product suite as uniquely optimized to power mainstream global payments, differentiating it from the abstract, token-driven systems envisaged by Bitcoin and other blockchains.

But with Circle, Stripe, and Google all planning to launch their own payment-focused Layer 1 chains, Ripple's offering faces new competition.

From the very beginning, payments have driven the development of blockchain technology, even as other use cases have multiplied.

The biggest development in recent years has been the rise of stablecoins. However, several designs for tokenized deposits and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) also leverage blockchain technology.

However, the public blockchains that currently dominate aren't optimized for small-value, retail transactions, and can't compete on price with legacy, interbank rails. Nor does the infrastructure for stablecoin payment acceptance come close to global card networks.

Against this backdrop, Circle, Stripe, and Google are seeking to reimagine blockchain payments by building new, custom blockchains from the ground up.

Since Circle launched USDC in 2018, it has expanded across two dozen Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchains, but none of these were designed to host the stablecoin.

High throughput chains like Solana and Polygon have brought USDC fees down to less than $0.01 per transaction. But fees need to be paid in each network's native token, introducing an extra layer of complexity for users.

Because it utilizes USDC as its gas currency, Circle's Arc seeks to overcome this problem, lowering fees and simplifying both the developer and user experience of stablecoins.

In a similar vein, Stripe's proposed blockchain, codenamed Tempo, is reportedly designed to speed up stablecoin transactions, lower costs, and attract enterprise customers, especially large-scale businesses.

Of the firms seeking to shake up blockchain payments, Google is the most ambitious.

Rather than simply building a new stablecoin chain like Circle and Stripe, Google Cloud Universal Ledger (GCUL) is envisaged as a much more open-ended blockchain payments solution.

While the firm hasn't revealed much about how the platform will work, GCUL is expected to support a range of payment instruments, including stablecoins.

Both the rise of stablecoins and Google's under-development blockchain platform pose a threat to Ripple, which provides cross-border payment solutions that bypass the correspondent banking system.

These days, however, stablecoins offer many of the same advantages for international transfers, and there are a growing number of payment solutions that leverage stablecoins as a cross-border settlement layer.

Facing intense competition, Ripple launched RLUSD in 2024, positioning it as a more institution-friendly alternative to USDT and USDC. But with Circle and Tether increasingly vying for the institutional stablecoin market with custom products and services, it may be too late for Ripple to catch up.

Meanwhile, Google is focusing on the high-value backbone of capital markets, building a product that could have broad appeal across banking and finance.

GCUL offers a single API for multi-asset settlement, granting institutions a one-stop alternative to Ripple's network for both foreign exchange legs and principal settlement. This diminishes the case for using XRP as bridging liquidity, which remains a key service for Ripple.

If the platform functions as an orchestration solution for different forms of digital money, including stablecoins, tokenized deposits and potentially even CBDCs, banks could extend it to cross-border treasury, trade finance, and payment service provider settlements—areas Ripple courts today.

The Ethereum price prediction charts are flashing green, and whales are paying attention. Billions in ETH are moving off exchanges, staking is up, and spot ETF inflows are growing. But Ethereum isn't the only asset getting attention. Traders are also watching ecosystem plays like Uniswap—and newer projects like Layer Brett—for the kind of upside ETH can't offer anymore.



The Ethereum price prediction conversation is heating up—again. Ethereum's seeing a fresh wave of confidence. Whales are stacking, spot ETF flows are ticking up, and analysts are tossing around targets as high as $7,000 for 2025. The reasons are clear: Ethereum still leads in smart contracts, NFTs, and DeFi—and staking is giving holders even more reason to stick around.

But that same dominance can also be a drag. With such a massive market cap, Ethereum just doesn't have the room to explode like it used to. Ten-times returns? Unlikely. It's still solid—but it's no longer the place for outsized gains.

The bottom line? The Ethereum price prediction remains strong, but for traders chasing life-changing gains, ETH isn't the only bet. Whales are diversifying—and ecosystem tokens like Uniswap and Layer Brett are catching serious attention as the next wave of high-growth opportunities within the Ethereum universe.

Uniswap is back on whale radar—and not just as a tag-along to Ethereum's rally. With the Ethereum price prediction trending bullish, DeFi volume is starting to pick up, and Uniswap is still the largest decentralised exchange in the game. Whale wallets have been steadily accumulating, with large withdrawals from centralised exchanges suggesting big players are positioning early.

Uniswap also scored regulatory credibility through its Wyoming DAO structure, a legal step forward that's giving some investors more confidence in the long-term viability of the protocol. But this cycle, it's not just about governance—it's about liquidity, speed, and DeFi tools that actually get used. That's where Uniswap shines.

UNI doesn't need to reinvent itself. If Ethereum breaks out, on-chain activity follows—and Uniswap benefits directly. That's why traders watching the Ethereum price prediction aren't just holding ETH. They're doubling down on ecosystem tokens with utility, traction, and upside. UNI checks all three boxes.



While Ethereum leads the market and Uniswap captures DeFi flows, Layer Brett is carving out its own lane—by combining meme energy with real Ethereum Layer 2 infrastructure. Layer Brett's fast, cheap, and live, with a staking dApp already paying out APYs north of 2,000%. For traders watching Ethereum's climb but still hunting high-multiple plays, Layer Brett is hard to ignore.

The Layer Brett presale has cleared $1.5 million, the token supply is capped at 10 billion, and gamified staking and NFT tie-ins are already pulling in early momentum. But it's the setup that's attracting smart money: Ethereum compatibility, real-time rewards, and zero reliance on hype tweets or dev promises.

As the Ethereum price prediction trends higher, whales are looking deeper into the Ethereum stack. Some are buying Uniswap. But others are buying Layer Brett—because it offers the same ecosystem exposure, with way more upside. For this cycle, that math makes sense.

Ethereum still dominates on fundamentals, and the price outlook remains solid. But when big wallets start looking elsewhere, it's not because ETH is weak—it's because smaller tokens offer more room to run. Uniswap makes sense as a DeFi proxy. Layer Brett makes sense as a volatility play. In a cycle that rewards early entries, the smart money isn't just holding ETH. It's hedging with tokens built for breakout speed.

Ethereum remains in a corrective phase after failing to break convincingly above its all-time high near $4.9K. The price has slipped below key supports, raising doubts about short-term momentum.

The coming sessions are likely to determine whether ETH maintains its broader bullish trajectory or enters a deeper correction.

By Shayan

On the daily chart, ETH continues to trade within its ascending channel, though momentum has clearly weakened following the rejection at the channel's upper boundary. The asset has now pulled back toward the midline support around $4.2K, which has repeatedly acted as a key demand zone.

The RSI has declined to around 52, reflecting cooling bullish strength and growing equilibrium between buyers and sellers. A decisive break below $4.2K would likely expose the $3.8K region, which overlaps with the sell-side liquidity pocket and prior consolidation levels.

Conversely, if buyers hold this level, ETH could consolidate before mounting another attempt toward the $4.8K resistance zone, keeping the broader bullish structure intact.



On the 4-hour timeframe, ETH has broken below its steeper ascending trendline, though the broader channel midline near $4.2K continues to provide crucial support. This has placed the market in a consolidation range bounded by $4.2K support and $4.8K resistance.

The $4.2K demand zone is the key battleground. A breakdown here would confirm a shift in market structure, likely accelerating a move toward the $3.8K area. However, if buyers defend this support and reclaim the $4.6K swing high, momentum could quickly reverse, with liquidity targets at $4.8K and potentially beyond.



By Shayan

Over the past week, Ethereum's sharp rejection from $4.9K triggered a cascade of long liquidations, sending the price lower toward the $4.2K range. The liquidation heatmap highlights where leveraged positions are clustered, offering insight into which levels are most likely to attract price in the short term.

The heatmap currently shows a dense liquidity cluster between $4.8K and $5K, where aggressive short positions were previously trapped. This remains a significant upside target, suggesting that any bullish push could aim to sweep remaining short liquidations in this zone.

On the downside, large concentrations of long liquidations have accumulated within the $3.8K–$4.2K range, aligning with key technical support areas. If sellers regain control, these levels could serve as downside magnets, accelerating further corrections.

Until one side is decisively cleared, Ethereum is likely to remain in a range-bound, liquidity-driven environment. A breakout above $4.6K would likely trigger a run into the $4.8K liquidity pool, while a breakdown below $4.2K could open the path toward the $3.8K zone.

Ethereum and XRP continue to dominate investor discussions, with ETH approaching a potential push to $4,500 and XRP showing resilience around the $3 mark. Yet, as institutional inflows pour into established giants, one under-the-radar presale token — Moonshot MAGAX — is capturing attention as the next breakout contender.

Ethereum currently trades at ~$4,300, inching closer to key resistance at $4,800. Analysts point to growing demand from institutions, particularly as Ethereum solidifies its place in decentralized finance (DeFi), tokenization, and real-world asset adoption. The recent spike in Ethereum futures trading volume reinforces market confidence, while network upgrades focused on scalability and gas fee reduction continue to strengthen its position as the backbone of Web3 infrastructure.

XRP remains a reliable favorite for investors seeking exposure to efficient payments and cross-border settlement. Trading at $2.81, XRP has held this level firmly despite broader market volatility. Positive regulatory news, particularly clarity around XRP's legal standing in the United States, has fueled renewed optimism. Institutional payment corridors across Asia and Latin America are also increasingly integrating RippleNet technology, further expanding its real-world utility.

Ethereum's upward momentum suggests the potential to retest its all-time high above $4,600. Meanwhile, XRP is consolidating but poised for a breakout should buying pressure intensify. 

Crypto markets thrive on narratives; for Ethereum, it's institutional adoption and DeFi expansion, while for XRP, it's the regulatory clarity that gives legitimacy to its cross-border payment solutions. Both assets benefit from favorable macroeconomic trends, but the biggest gains often come from early-stage projects.

Ethereum whales have steadily increased their holdings, signaling confidence in ETH's long-term trajectory. Similarly, XRP's whale wallets have shown accumulation during recent price consolidations.

However, large-cap coins typically deliver steadier but smaller percentage gains, which has fueled a rotation of capital into presale tokens like MAGAX, where growth potential is significantly higher. This trend suggests that retail investors are increasingly seeking asymmetric opportunities that offer a higher risk-reward profile.

Moonshot MAGAX is positioning itself as a hybrid token that blends meme culture with real-world utility. Its AI-powered ecosystem is designed to reward viral content creators, effectively turning internet culture into a monetizable economy. 

At just $0.00027 in presale, analysts suggest MAGAX could deliver outsized gains compared to ETH or XRP. With deflationary tokenomics and staking rewards, MAGAX offers a sustainable growth model, unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype.

While Ethereum and XRP showcase remarkable strength and institutional backing, the real story for many investors is the search for the next high-growth opportunity. The market is witnessing a clear trend of capital moving into promising new projects like MAGAX that offer both utility and the potential for explosive returns. 

This shift highlights a growing appetite among investors to diversify their portfolios with tokens that combine established market principles with innovative, community-driven use cases.

At just $0.00027 in presale, analysts suggest MAGAX could deliver outsized gains compared to ETH or XRP. With deflationary tokenomics and staking rewards, MAGAX offers a sustainable growth model — unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype.

For those entering early, MAGAX offers even more upside: investors can use the limited-time MAGAXLIVE bonus code to secure additional tokens during the presale. Combined with the project's successful Certik Audit Certificate, which validates its smart contract security, confidence in MAGAX continues to build.

As Ethereum pushes toward $4,600 and XRP consolidates around $3, MAGAX presents the kind of asymmetric opportunity retail investors look for in 2025 — high potential, low entry cost, and strong fundamentals backed by verified security.

Real Vision founder and CEO Raoul Pal believes a significant number of altcoins are on the cusps of major rallies.

Pal tells his 1.2 million followers on the social media platform X that “many key parts of the crypto ecosystem are in the waiting room ready to launch.”

According to the macro guru, an increase in global liquidity is one of the key bullish catalysts that is going to drive the rally in altcoins.

“And the rate of change is only going to rise in the key metric of Total Global Liquidity… US, EU, China and Japan all need to roll debts. This is an absurdly bullish backdrop, along with the regulatory changes, digital asset treasury firms and sovereign accumulation along with Wall Street acceptance.”

Starting with Solana (SOL), Pal says the sixth-largest crypto asset by market cap is about to go higher.

Based on a chart of Solana on the weekly timeframe, Pal appears to be suggesting that Solana is forming an ascending triangle, a bullish continuation pattern.

Next up is Sui (SUI). According to the macro guru, Sui will follow Solana in rallying.

Based on a chart of Sui on the weekly time frame, it appears Pal is suggesting that Sui is forming a parallel ascending channel.

Turning to XRP (XRP), Pal says the third-largest crypto asset by market cap is in the process of breaking out.

Based on an XRP chart on the weekly time frame, it appears Pal is suggesting that the third-largest crypto asset by market cap has formed a series of bullish pennants since it was launched and the current one is currently in progress.

The Anoma Foundation is revolutionizing the cryptocurrency space with the launch of the Namada Mainnet. This Layer-1 blockchain protocol is designed to enhance privacy across multiple blockchain networks, offering innovative solutions for both fungible and non-fungible assets (NFTs). As privacy becomes increasingly critical in the crypto landscape, Namada's groundbreaking approach is set to redefine how users interact with blockchain technology.

Namada employs advanced zero-knowledge cryptography to enable confidential transactions. This cutting-edge technology ensures sensitive data remains private while still allowing for transaction verification. By utilizing zero-knowledge proofs, Namada facilitates secure and private interactions across ecosystems like Ethereum and Cosmos. This positions Namada as a standout player in the blockchain space, offering unparalleled privacy solutions.

One of Namada's most innovative features is its concept of "composable privacy." Unlike traditional privacy solutions that are often siloed, composable privacy allows seamless and private interactions across various platforms and applications. This ensures users can maintain confidentiality while engaging with multiple blockchain ecosystems, making privacy practical and accessible for all cryptocurrency users.

Privacy is a cornerstone of blockchain technology, and its absence poses significant risks to decentralization. Awa Sun Yin, co-founder of Namada, has emphasized that without robust privacy measures, centralization risks could undermine the very principles of cryptocurrencies. Namada's focus on privacy directly addresses these challenges, ensuring a more secure and decentralized future for blockchain users.

Heliax, the research and development team behind Anoma and Namada, has played a pivotal role in advancing privacy-focused blockchain solutions. In December 2022, Heliax organized the largest-ever trusted setup ceremony, involving 2,510 participants. This milestone underscores Heliax's commitment to building secure and trustworthy blockchain protocols.

Namada's public testing phases have attracted over 200 institutional and independent validators. This strong community and institutional interest highlight the project's potential for widespread adoption. Rigorous testing ensures Namada's privacy features are robust and ready for real-world applications.

The Anoma Foundation has announced plans to release detailed updates on Namada's developmental roadmap, token metrics, and initial proposals. These updates will provide greater clarity on how Namada aims to achieve its vision of practical and accessible privacy for all cryptocurrency users.

Namada's commitment to privacy is complemented by its focus on the growing multichain ecosystem. By enabling confidential transactions across multiple blockchain networks, Namada is poised to become a key player in the evolution of decentralized finance (DeFi) and other blockchain applications.

While composable privacy is a groundbreaking feature, implementing it across multiple ecosystems presents unique challenges. Ensuring compatibility and maintaining high levels of security are critical factors that Namada must address. However, the project's innovative approach and strong community support suggest it is well-equipped to overcome these hurdles.

Namada's privacy features stand out, but how do they compare to other privacy-focused blockchain projects? While direct comparisons are complex, Namada's emphasis on composable privacy and zero-knowledge cryptography positions it as a forward-looking solution in the space.

The launch of the Namada Mainnet is a significant milestone for the Anoma Foundation and the broader cryptocurrency community. By prioritizing privacy and leveraging advanced cryptographic techniques, Namada is paving the way for a more secure and decentralized blockchain ecosystem. With features like composable privacy and zero-knowledge cryptography, Namada is set to shape the future of blockchain technology and redefine how users interact with digital assets, including NFTs.

The total crypto market cap has grown by nearly 400% in the last three years, from $727B in October 2022 to a staggering $3.72T at the time of writing.

That kind of growth is unheard of in traditional stock market indices. But wait until you hear what Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse thinks is next for crypto.

Keep reading to discover why Ripple's boss predicts such explosive growth for crypto, his insights on Ripple's own token, $XRP, and how you can position yourself for this potentially outrageous rally by loading up on the best altcoins to buy now.

Garlinghouse cited the vulnerability of traditional fiat currencies as the biggest reason behind his extremely bullish crypto outlook.

He explained that macroeconomic pressures on fiat are all but certain to intensify in the coming years, which could push traditional currencies toward devaluation and long-term instability.

Amid such uncertainty, digital assets provide more than just hope; they're built specifically to plug the holes in the global financial system, offering transparency, efficiency, and inflation-resistant store of value that fiat currencies simply can't match.

As one of the biggest cryptocurrencies targeting the cross-border payments market, many believe $XRP could become one of the biggest success stories in the next few years.

All in all, with prominent industry voices bullish on crypto's long-term growth, everyday investors will fare extremely well if they simply exercise patience during slightly deeper consolidations like the one we're seeing now.

In fact, now's the perfect time to beef up your crypto portfolio with low-cap, high-upside tokens that are well-positioned to ride the upcoming boom.

Snorter Token ($SNORT) is one of the best cryptos to buy now for those looking to ride the explosive growth of the meme coin market.

While altcoins continue to dominate crypto discussions, the meme coin segment alone has grown by more than 70% in the past year, proving there's so much more juice in it than many realize.

$SNORT powers the Snorter Bot, a new Telegram-native trading bot designed to level the playing field between institutional players and everyday meme coin traders.

How? By allowing retail investors to set buy/sell orders in advance, and then automatically executing them the moment liquidity kicks in.

As a result, you'll finally get the chance to participate in those early meme coin pumps, where life-changing gains are usually made.



Security is another standout. Snorter offers protection against a wide range of on-chain threats, including front-running, rug pulls, honeypots, and even advanced sandwich attacks.

By buying $SNORT, you're positioning yourself to ride the adoption of Snorter Bot while unlocking a slew of exclusive benefits along the way:

Currently in presale, $SNORT has already pulled in over $3.55M from early investors, with each token available at just $0.1027.

Visit Snorter Token's official website for more information.

Maxi Doge ($MAXI) might not have a shiny whitepaper or game-changing technology, but its absurd mission to overthrow Dogecoin as the best meme coin on the planet has already gathered plenty of hype and community support.

The project has raised over $1.66M in early investor funding, proving that degen investors are hungry for a wild, rage-fueled meme coin.

What's Maxi Doge, really? Believe it or not, Maxi is Dogecoin's distant cousin. But the two are anything but close.

Dogecoin's popularity left Maxi in the shadows growing up, as the elder, more ‘wholesome' Shiba Inu hogged all the limelight at family gatherings.

That's when Maxi found solace in the gym and in front of the charts, where he built big muscles and chased even bigger gains.



Now, backed by a fierce community of $MAXI holders who all subscribe to his mantra of ‘never skip leg day, never skip a pump', the dawg is ready to take the market by storm.

Interested? Join the tribe by buying $MAXI at just $0.0002545 apiece. Hurry up, though, because the price will increase in just a few hours.

Check out Maxi Doge's official website for more information.

Ethereum ($ETH) has undoubtedly been the talk of the crypto town over the past two weeks, with whales pouring big money into the ‘digital silver.'

For instance, BlackRock recently snapped up more than $314M worth of Ethereum, while Goldman Sachs and Jane Street grabbed a combined 192.5K $ETH.

More notably, Thomas Lee, a significant voice in the crypto space, explained that while Wall Street once dismissed Ethereum for being slower than Solana or Sui, institutions are now betting big on it because of its ability to deliver 100% uptime – something non-negotiable for big-money players.

‘If ETH stays above $4,800, we could see a really big cycle,' Lee added.



That prediction looks even stronger when you consider that a massive $4.65B worth of shorts would be liquidated if Ethereum retests its all-time high.

Although $ETH has been red all week, the drop isn't as bad as it looks – because its weekly candle remains within last week's range.

According to the technical playbook, this forms a classic ‘inside candle' pattern, and a breakout here could trigger an explosive rally.

With Ripple's CEO projecting a nearly tenfold increase in crypto's valuation by 2030, the stage is set for promising altcoins like $SNORT, $MAXI, and $ETH to shine in the upcoming bull run.

That said, kindly bear in mind that crypto investments are highly risky. Also, none of the above is financial advice, and you must always do your own research before investing.

The US Department of Commerce has begun posting macroeconomic data on public blockchains – the administration's latest move in putting its money, or in this case national economic data, where its mouth is as regards embracing the use of innovative technology.

Best-known for powering cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, and increasingly used in fields such as supply-chain management, blockchain is a distributed-ledger technology (DLT) that securely records transactions in ‘blocks' linked together using cryptographic hashes to form a tamper-proof ‘chain'. It allows multiple participants to verify, store and share data without need for a central authority. 

The Department of Commerce announced this week (28 August) that it will begin posting real gross domestic product (GDP) data on blockchain, starting with July 2025 data.

‘This is the first time a federal agency has published economic statistical data like this on the blockchain, and the latest way the Department is utilising innovative technology to protect federal data and promote public use,' the Department of Commerce stated in its announcement.  

‘Through this landmark effort, the Department hopes to demonstrate the wide utility of blockchain technology. It also aims to demonstrate a proof-of-concept for all of government, and to build on the Trump Administration's historic efforts to make the United States of America the blockchain capital of the world,' the announcement added.

The accuracy and integrity of US economic data has become an increasingly high profile topic since Trump returned to the White House in January. Earlier this month (August) he fired Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner Erika McEntarfer after a monthly jobs report infuriated him, posting on his social media platform Truth Social: ‘In my opinion, today's Jobs Numbers were RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad… But, the good news is, our Country is doing GREAT!'.

“It's only fitting that the Commerce Department and President Donald Trump, the Crypto-President, publicly release economic statistical data on the blockchain,” said US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick in this week's announcement. “We are making America's economic truth immutable and globally accessible like never before, cementing our role as the blockchain capital of the world.”

The department published what it describes as an ‘official hash' of the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)'s quarterly GDP data release for 2025's second quarter – and, in some cases, the topline GDP figure for 2025's second quarter – to nine blockchains in total. Data was also further disseminated through coordination with two ‘oracles' (oracles are entities that connect blockchains to external systems) while three exchanges ‘helped facilitate the Department's publishing', the announcement detailed.

The nine blockchains are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, TRON, Stellar, Avalanche, Arbitrum One, Polygon PoS and Optimism. The oracles are Pyth (Pyth Network) and Chainlink. The exchanges – used by the department to buy cryptocurrency needed to pay for posting transactions on the blockchains, according to a report by news agency Bloomberg – are Coinbase, Gemini and Kraken. 

‘The Department will continue to innovate and broaden the scope of publishing future datasets like GDP to include the use of other blockchains, oracles and exchanges,' according to the announcement.

The Department of Commerce provides technical details in its press announcement of the data release (available as a pdf).

This hash was published to the nine blockchains ‘either as a memo or as data embedded in a smart contract, along with the topline figure, as each chain permitted,' the department explains (it provides the transaction hash or smart contract address for each blockchain). It also highlights that data from the BEA – a bureau within the Department of Commerce – can be found through the BEA's Application Programming Interface (API).

In a blogpost published on the same day (28 August), Chainlink stated that ‘new Chainlink Data Feeds [are now] securely deliver[ing] critical information around key US economic data onchain, including Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, and Real Final Sales to Private Domestic Purchasers.' 

‘By bringing macroeconomic data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis onchain, Chainlink is showcasing how trusted oracle networks can serve as critical infrastructure connecting public institutions with blockchain markets, unlocking new innovations while supporting compliance and regulatory progress in the United States,' Chainlink stated.

‘Without question, this marks a critical step forward in the public sector's embrace of decentralised infrastructure,' Pyth stated in its own blogpost (28 August).

‘The integrity of economic data is essential to global markets, and bringing this data onchain opens up new frontiers for transparency, accessibility, and composability across DeFi [decentralised finance], enterprise use cases and public accountability,' Pyth added, stating that ‘this new initiative reflects a deliberate effort by the US government to harness cryptographic tools to increase confidence in public information systems.'

 Bitcoin and Ether ETFs saw outflows on Friday after the Fed reported rising core inflation, driven in part by Trump's tariff policies. 

Spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs recorded outflows on Friday as the Federal Reserve released key inflation data showing price pressures are creeping higher under President Donald Trump's trade policies.

According to SoSoValue data, Ether (ETH) ETFs saw a net outflow of $164.64 million, reversing five straight days of inflows that had added more than $1.5 billion to the asset class. 

Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs also turned negative with $126.64 million in net outflows, their first daily loss since Aug. 22. Total assets under management dropped to $28.58 billion for Ethereum and $139.95 billion for Bitcoin.

Fidelity's FBTC recorded the steepest single-day outflow at $66.2 million among Bitcoin ETFs. ARK Invest and 21Shares' ARKB followed with a $72.07 million net withdrawal, while Grayscale's GBTC saw $15.3 million exit. Only a few funds posted minor inflows, with BlackRock's IBIT gaining $24.63 million and WisdomTree's BTCW adding $2.3 million.

The outflows coincided with the release of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which showed a 2.9% annualized rise in July, the highest since February. 

The report, which matched forecasts, came amid growing evidence that Trump's tariff regime is adding pressure on core prices by raising import costs, according to CNBC.

Trump's White House has imposed a baseline 10% tariff on all imports and targeted additional categories through reciprocal duties. Though energy prices helped keep broader inflation in check, services jumped 3.6% year-over-year.

Despite the uptick in inflation, the market is still pricing in the likelihood of a Federal Reserve rate cut at its next meeting, particularly if labor market data shows further signs of weakness, per the CNBC report.

Since their launch in July 2024, Ether spot ETFs have gained steady traction, with net inflows rising 44% in August, from $9.5 billion to $13.7 billion. Analysts attribute the growth to a rebound in institutional interest following a period of underperformance relative to Bitcoin.

Corporate treasury adoption of Ether is also accelerating. Companies now hold 4.4 million ETH, valued at over $19 billion, roughly 3.7% of total supply, according to StrategicETHReserve.

“After an extended period of underperformance relative to Bitcoin and a souring investor sentiment, Ethereum has recently experienced a significant revival in the recognition of both its adoption rate and value proposition,” Sygnum chief investment officer Fabian Dori told Cointelegraph.

In the ever-changing world of cryptocurrency, whale movements are having a significant impact on where people put their money, especially in utility-driven altcoins such as Remittix. Investors are increasingly interested in projects that can be used in real life, moving away from assets that have no clear use. In this article, we're going to look at how whale activity shapes market trends, what makes Remittix stand out, and what this means for the future of crypto investments. So buckle up, because we may be looking at a shift in how we invest in 2025.

Whale movements have always been a big deal in the crypto world. These large holders can send shockwaves through the market with their buying and selling actions. When whales move, everyone feels the effects. It's almost like they have a sixth sense for where the market is going. Their decisions can indicate confidence in certain assets, which in turn influences retail investors to follow suit. The latest movement seems to be gravitating towards utility-driven altcoins, with Remittix taking the lead.

What's striking is the growing interest in utility-driven altcoins over speculative cryptocurrencies. Projects that have tangible applications, like Remittix, are emerging as the new favorites. Why does this matter? Because they align more with the real-world demand for practical use cases, rather than relying on the hype surrounding meme coins or fleeting trends.

Remittix is making headlines as a key player among altcoins, catching the attention of both retail and institutional investors. This project has sold over 630 million tokens at $0.10 each, which translates to a whopping $22.3 million raised. It's positioned as a PayFi solution, streamlining crypto-to-fiat transactions and addressing inefficiencies in traditional remittance services. With its first centralized exchange (CEX) listing confirmed on BitMart and another on LBANK, Remittix might be on the brink of significant growth.

Whale movements can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, they can show that there is confidence and stability in the market. But on the other hand, these massive transactions can also lead to increased volatility, and if whales decide to sell, it could lead to panic selling.

For those eyeing 2025, it's high time to adapt investment strategies to focus on utility-driven altcoins. The rise of Remittix emphasizes the importance of having a solid use case to attract money. With crypto payroll solutions gaining traction, stablecoins are becoming a more attractive option for paying salaries.

However, the road isn't smooth for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Europe looking to integrate altcoins into their operations. They'll have to comply with the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, which demands transparency and operational oversight. SMEs will have to cut through the red tape while also leveraging the benefits of cryptocurrency.

The cryptocurrency market is at an interesting juncture. Whale movements are significantly nudging the scene toward utility-driven altcoins like Remittix. As investors turn their gaze to projects that offer something tangible, the landscape is evolving. The integration of cryptocurrency into payroll solutions and the rules guiding it will undeniably shape the future of how we think about crypto investments. For those looking to capitalize on these trends, understanding whale activity and the potential of utility-driven altcoins will be key to navigating this market.

 El Salvador has transferred its 6,274 Bitcoin into 14 new wallet addresses as part of a security measure to protect against the threat of quantum attacks. 

El Salvador has redistributed its Bitcoin reserve holdings into 14 new wallet addresses as a precaution against potential quantum computing threats.

“By splitting funds into smaller amounts, the impact of a potential quantum attack is minimized,” El Salvador's Bitcoin Office said in an X post Friday, adding that each Bitcoin (BTC) address holds up to 500 BTC.

The Bitcoin Office explained that once funds are spent from a Bitcoin address, its public keys are revealed and vulnerable — making it a target for quantum computers to crack — should the technology evolve into a significant threat in the future.

More than 6 million Bitcoin — worth around $650 billion — could be at risk if quantum computers become powerful enough to crack elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) keys, quantum research company Project Eleven said in April.

El Salvador previously held its 6,274 Bitcoin stash (worth $678 million) in a single address, but blockchain data shows those funds were transferred into 14 new addresses on Friday.

While El Salvador's move was praised by industry pundits, Project Eleven noted that quantum computing is still far away from being capable of hacking Bitcoin. A Bitcoin private key contains 256-bits, and no quantum computer running Shor's algorithm has managed to even crack a 3-bit key yet.

Michael Saylor, the architect behind Strategy's Bitcoin playbook, said quantum computing's threat to Bitcoin is mere hype in June, adding that if it ever became a serious issue, the protocol's core developers and hardware manufacturers would implement fixes.

El Salvador's Bitcoin buys have been called into question after an International Monetary Fund report in July claimed that the Central American country has not made any new Bitcoin purchases since February.

The country's Bitcoin Office hasn't directly addressed the claims and has continued to post about its Bitcoin purchases on X. 

El Salvador secured a $1.4 billion funding deal from the IMF in December 2024 in exchange for scaling back its Bitcoin initiatives, among other conditions — though the terms appear to be under dispute between the two parties.

The cryptocurrency universe is not just evolving; it's witnessing a paradigm shift, one punctuated by Sharps Technology's audacious announcement of a $400 million investment to craft a vast Solana treasury. This momentous step doesn't merely amplify Solana's position within the market; it signals a broader awakening as institutional investors increasingly turn their attention to blockchain technology. As a flood of institutional players dives into the Solana ecosystem, we stand at the threshold of a revolution in digital asset management that could transform market behaviors across the crypto landscape.

This $400 million initiative firmly plants Sharps Technology at the helm of the Solana treasury project, catering specifically to institutional players keen on harnessing Solana's robust transaction capabilities. As Alice Zhang, the trailblazing Chief Investment Officer, articulately noted, “Solana sets the benchmark for digital infrastructure, offering a real-time, low-cost settlement platform for everything from established equities to niche private assets.” This perspective illustrates the integral role that digital infrastructure can play in cultivating a resilient cryptocurrency market.

The investment not only reflects a resounding vote of confidence from institutional quarters but also brings along partners from respected firms like ParaFi and Pantera. Their presence is expected to inject substantial liquidity into Solana's ecosystem, paving the way for enhanced price resilience and an uptick in staking appeal—critical components for nurturing a flourishing digital asset treasury landscape.

Sharps Technology's tactical move mirrors successful treasury management blueprints pioneered by stalwarts like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Should the accompanying warrants for this investment be exercised, analysts speculate we could see an infusion of up to $1 billion into Solana's market cap. Historically, such institutional entries tend to galvanize remarkable interest in the underpinning assets, accelerating Solana's assimilation into the portfolios of global treasuries.

Additionally, Sharps' strategic alliance with the Solana Foundation, which features a $50 million SOL acquisition at a 15% discount, underscores a relentless commitment to forging tighter bonds within the Solana ecosystem. This partnership serves to bolster investor confidence while fortifying the network against market turbulence, thereby improving compliance with the growing regulatory demands on cryptocurrency operations.

Post-announcement, the market's reaction was unequivocally explosive, culminating in a staggering 70% jump in Sharps Technology's stock prices. This remarkable surge highlights a pivotal shift toward institutional engagement in the cryptocurrency domain. As traditional financial institutions begin to regard cryptocurrency not simply as speculative assets, but as essential instruments in corporate treasury management, we are witnessing a transformative moment.

However, this swell of institutional involvement raises significant concerns about the core tenets of decentralization. With the focus turning to colossal players like Solana—bolstered by expansive treasury strategies—there's a palpable risk of overshadowing the very principles that drove the original blockchain innovations. Startups and decentralized organizations may find it increasingly challenging to navigate a landscape that tends to favor established connections and significant resources.

As institutional stakes in crypto treasuries continue to escalate, we can anticipate increased scrutiny from regulators. For startups and smaller entities, mastering the evolving maze of compliance becomes paramount. Industry experts reiterate the importance of operational efficiency and adherence to forthcoming fiat-to-crypto regulations as non-negotiable priorities.

While leaders like Sharps Technology may spearhead the development of sophisticated financial strategies in digital asset management, there remains a palpable concern that this could foster a playing field heavily tilted toward those with pre-existing networks and deep pockets.

Sharps Technology's $400 million investment places Solana on a path brimful of promise. This influx not only equips Solana for greater uptake among corporate treasuries and key financial players but also modifies the contours of the cryptocurrency landscape. As we heed the unfolding changes, closely monitoring on-chain dynamics and staking tendencies will be crucial in deciphering the market currents.

This high-stakes investment might embolden other firms to emulate similar treasury strategies pioneered by Sharps Technology. Nevertheless, the significant challenges for smaller entities amidst this increasingly institutionalized crypto framework cannot be disregarded.

Sharps Technology's formidable $400 million Solana treasury investment stands as a landmark moment in the landscape of digital assets. As institutional interest continues to swell, the implications for market stability, regulatory compliance, and commitment to decentralization will remain hotly contested. With the potential to redefine investment paradigms within cryptocurrency, this landmark decision could send reverberations throughout the industry, reshaping how digital assets intertwine with corporate financial practices. As we navigate this intricate terrain, the interplay between institutional commitments and regulatory frameworks promises to be a critical determinant of the cryptocurrency's future.

The debate is sharpening a growing divide across the Atlantic with Europe pushing forward with its CBDC plans

By

Published

Global efforts to develop central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are sparking sharp debate, raising fears over state control of money and savings.

Advocates frame CBDCs as the next stage in financial technology. Critics, however, warn that programmable digital money could give governments sweeping new powers.

CBDCs are digital versions of national currencies, issued on permissioned blockchains operated by central banks. Unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies, they function within a closed system where officials control access and policy. That structure consequently fuels concern among analysts who fear the tools may be used for surveillance.

“Not all digital currencies are the same,” said Susie Violet Ward, financial analyst and co-founder of Bitcoin Policy UK. She argued CBDCs represent “the weaponization of money in its purest form.” Ward noted that programmable features could allow central banks to set expiry dates on savings. In her view, such design options would let governments decide how and when citizens spend.

“Even George Orwell did not predict programmable money,” she said. “That almost closes the 1984 loop perfectly,” Ward said.

The debate is sharpening a growing divide across the Atlantic. The European Union is pressing forward with its digital euro project. Meanwhile, the United States is rejecting CBDCs and focusing on private stablecoin development. This policy gap highlights competing visions for the future of digital finance.

On Friday, the US House added a ban on CBDCs to a nearly 1,300-page defense policy bill for fiscal 2026. Furthermore, the measure would stop the Federal Reserve from issuing digital currencies or providing financial products directly to individuals. In July, lawmakers also passed the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act by a slim majority of 219 to 210. That bill now waits in the Senate.

President Donald Trump reinforced the stance earlier this year. On January 23, he signed an executive order prohibiting any creation, circulation, or use of a CBDC in the United States. Further, he cited threats to financial stability, privacy, and national sovereignty as reasons for the move.

The European Central Bank has chosen the opposite path. ECB President Christine Lagarde said the digital euro is expected to launch in October 2025. She also stressed that it would coexist with cash and offer privacy protections to address fears of state overreach. Reports suggest European officials are even exploring whether to build the system on major public blockchains like Ethereum.

Other nations are advancing their own CBDC pilots, often raising similar concerns. In Brazil, the central bank published the source code for its digital option in July 2023. Observers also quickly spotted features that allowed officials to freeze or reduce user funds in digital wallets. Within four days, critics warned the system gave the state extraordinary financial control.

Proponents argue that CBDCs could increase financial inclusion and lower transaction costs. They point to unbanked populations who could gain access to secure digital payment tools. However, skeptics counter that surveillance features overshadow those benefits. They warn that centralized systems risk eroding civil liberties if governments abuse their authority.

Historians and divers are trying to retrieve prehistoric clues from beneath the waves—but they have to act fast.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Around 8,000 to 6,000 BCE, the North and Baltic seas ... weren't seas at all. Instead, they were vast plains that were home to ancient human civilizations. But as the curtain drew to a close on the last Ice Age, water levels rose and inundated these low-lying areas, wiping away any trace of prospering civilizations. Well—almost any trace. 

The University of Bradford's Submerged Landscapes Research Centre in the U.K., TNO Geological Survey of the Netherlands, Flanders Marine Institute, and the University of York will soon explore these long-lost civilizations as part of a research collaboration known as SUBNORDICA. One of the ancient lands the project aims to explore is Doggerland, which is thought to have thrived in North Sea region some 8,200 years ago.

“Twenty-thousand years ago, the global sea level was 130 metres lower than at present. With progressive global warming and sea-level rise, unique landscapes, home to human societies for millennia, disappeared,” Vincent Gaffney, leader of the Submerged Landscapes Research Centre, said in a press statement. “We know almost nothing about the people who lived on these great plains. As Europe and the world approaches net zero, development of the coastal shelves is now a strategic priority. SUBNORDICA will use the latest technologies to explore these lands and support sustainable development.”

Among those technologies will be advanced seabed mapping and computer simulation of lost settlements, as well as additional AI tools, seismic and acoustic surveys, and boreholes. In March, the University of Bradford announced its plan to analyze data gathered from magnetometer surveys intended for the environmental impact assessment of future green energy initiatives. University researchers say magnetic fields can help identify “peat-forming areas…or where erosion has occurred, for example in river channels.” 

And time is of the essence for investigating these water-logged civilizations. Thousands of years ago, an additional 7.7 million square miles were above water, and of that portion, 1.16 million square miles lay along Europe's existing coastline. Researchers describe the region as “the most attractive land for prehistoric settlement anywhere in the continent.” 

Today, this land largely makes up the coastal shelf that is currently under development as North Sea nations install offshore wind farms to combat climate change. This vast expansion of green energy infrastructure could limit scientific access to these areas, so projects like SUBNORDICA are rushing to investigate the area before it's too late. 

“SUBNORDICA will investigate the significance of ancient coastlines and its resources for humans. Through diving surveys in Aarhus Bay [in Denmark] we will determine how widespread coastal settlements were compared to those in the interior and determine how marine resources were exploited 9000 to 8500 years ago,” Peter Moe Astrup, underwater archaeologist at Denmark's Moesgaard Museum, said in a press statement. “This knowledge will then be used to target archaeological investigations in less accessible areas.”

As nations fight against rising seas—a fight that for some North Sea countries never truly ended—scientists are rushing to discover what happened to these prehistoric humans who similarly experienced a rise in temperature that threatened, and eventually vanquished, their civilizations.

When injured, cells have well-regulated responses to promote healing. These include a long-studied self-destruction process that cleans up dead and damaged cells as well as a more recently identified phenomenon that helps older cells revert to what appears to be a younger state to help grow back healthy tissue.

Now, a new study in mice led by researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and the Baylor College of Medicine reveals a previously unknown cellular purging process that may help injured cells revert to a stem cell-like state more rapidly. The investigators dubbed this newly discovered response cathartocytosis, taking from Greek root words that mean cellular cleansing.

Published online in the journal Cell Reports, the study used a mouse model of stomach injury to provide new insights into how cells heal, or fail to heal, in response to damage, such as from an infection or inflammatory disease.

"After an injury, the cell's job is to repair that injury. But the cell's mature cellular machinery for doing its normal job gets in the way," said first author Jeffrey W. Brown, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of medicine in the Division of Gastroenterology at WashU Medicine. "So, this cellular cleanse is a quick way of getting rid of that machinery so it can rapidly become a small, primitive cell capable of proliferating and repairing the injury. We identified this process in the GI tract, but we suspect it is relevant in other tissues as well."

Brown likened the process to a "vomiting" or jettisoning of waste that essentially adds a shortcut, helping the cell declutter and focus on regrowing healthy tissues faster than it would be able to if it could only perform a gradual, controlled degradation of waste.

As with many shortcuts, this one has potential downsides: According to the investigators, cathartocytosis is fast but messy, which may help shed light on how injury responses can go wrong, especially in the setting of chronic injury. For example, ongoing cathartocytosis in response to an infection is a sign of chronic inflammation and recurring cell damage that is a breeding ground for cancer. In fact, the festering mess of ejected cellular waste that results from all that cathartocytosis may also be a way to identify or track cancer, according to the researchers.

A novel cellular process

The researchers identified cathartocytosis within an important regenerative injury response called paligenosis, which was first described in 2018 by the current study's senior author, Jason C. Mills, MD, PhD. Now at the Baylor College of Medicine, Mills began this work while he was a faculty member in the Division of Gastroenterology at WashU Medicine and Brown was a postdoctoral researcher in his lab.

In paligenosis, injured cells shift away from their normal roles and undergo a reprogramming process to an immature state, behaving like rapidly dividing stem cells, as happens during development. Originally, the researchers assumed the decluttering of cellular machinery in preparation for this reprogramming happens entirely inside cellular compartments called lysosomes, where waste is digested in a slow and contained process.

From the start, though, the researchers noticed debris outside the cells. They initially dismissed this as unimportant, but the more external waste they saw in their early studies, the more Brown began to suspect that something deliberate was going on. He utilized a model of mouse stomach injury that triggered the reprogramming of mature cells to a stem cell state all at once, making it obvious that the "vomiting" response -- now happening in all the stomach cells simultaneously -- was a feature of paligenosis, not a bug. In other words, the vomiting process was not just an accidental spill here and there but a newly identified, standard way cells behaved in response to injury.

Although they discovered cathartocytosis happening during paligenosis, the researchers said cells could potentially use cathartocytosis to jettison waste in other, more worrisome situations, like giving mature cells that ability to start to act like cancer cells.

The downside to downsizing

While the newly discovered cathartocytosis process may help injured cells proceed through paligenosis and regenerate healthy tissue more rapidly, the tradeoff comes in the form of additional waste products that could fuel inflammatory states, making chronic injuries harder to resolve and correlating with increased risk of cancer development.

"In these gastric cells, paligenosis -- reversion to a stem cell state for healing -- is a risky process, especially now that we've identified the potentially inflammatory downsizing of cathartocytosis within it," Mills said. "These cells in the stomach are long-lived, and aging cells acquire mutations. If many older mutated cells revert to stem cell states in an effort to repair an injury -- and injuries also often fuel inflammation, such as during an infection -- there's an increased risk of acquiring, perpetuating and expanding harmful mutations that lead to cancer as those stem cells multiply."

More research is needed, but the authors suspect that cathartocytosis could play a role in perpetuating injury and inflammation in Helicobacter pylori infections in the gut. H. pylori is a type of bacteria known to infect and damage the stomach, causing ulcers and increasing the risk of stomach cancer.

The findings also could point to new treatment strategies for stomach cancer and perhaps other GI cancers. Brown and WashU Medicine collaborator Koushik K. Das, MD, an associate professor of medicine, have developed an antibody that binds to parts of the cellular waste ejected during cathartocytosis, providing a way to detect when this process may be happening, especially in large quantities. In this way, cathartocytosis might be used as a marker of precancerous states that could allow for early detection and treatment.

"If we have a better understanding of this process, we could develop ways to help encourage the healing response and perhaps, in the context of chronic injury, block the damaged cells undergoing chronic cathartocytosis from contributing to cancer formation," Brown said.

For people with macular telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel), an orphan retinal disorder that gradually destroys central vision, there have long been no approved treatment options. But now, a new study sponsored by Neurotech Pharmaceuticals and spearheaded by investigators at Scripps Research and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) offers compelling evidence that vision loss can be slowed with a neuroprotective surgical implant.

"This is a step toward redefining how we think about vision loss," says one of the corresponding authors, Professor Martin Friedlander of Scripps Research. "Instead of waiting for cells to die, we're learning how to protect and preserve them."

Published in in NEJM Evidence, the study reports results from two phase 3 clinical trials evaluating ENCELTO (revakinagene taroretcel-lwey), a surgically implanted device that continuously releases a therapeutic protein to preserve vision. Conducted across 47 sites internationally, the randomized trials enrolled 228 participants with MacTel, following their progress over a 24-month period.

The trials were coordinated by an international network of clinicians and researchers with key collaborators from the NIH's National Eye Institute, the Lowy Medical Research Institute, and Neurotech Pharmaceuticals. Their ensuing results helped support the March 2025 approval of ENCELTO for MacTel by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), making it the first authorized treatment for the condition and the first cell-based neuroprotective treatment for any neurodegenerative retinal disease or central nervous system disorder.

The trials followed identical designs but enrolled participants at different times and locations. While both trials showed that ENCELTO slowed the loss of light-sensing retinal cells, the effect was stronger in one trial, likely due to variations in disease severity and other factors among participants. Together, the results provide strong evidence that the implant can preserve vision in people with MacTel.

"This is the first time we've seen a therapy meaningfully alter the course of MacTel," says Friedlander. "It confirms that neuroprotection can be a powerful strategy to preserve vision in degenerative retinal conditions."

Friedlander, who's also president of the Lowy Medical Research Institute, has spent nearly two decades studying MacTel and helped lay the biological foundation for ENCELTO. The device delivers ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), a naturally occurring protein known to protect retinal neurons. ENCELTO also consists of genetically modified retinal pigment epithelial cells -- which help nourish and support the retina -- housed in a tiny, collagen-based capsule, which is implanted in the back of the eye. Thanks to the capsule design, the cells remain shielded from immune rejection while continuously releasing CNTF -- enabling long-term, localized delivery of the therapeutic molecule.

The study demonstrated that ENCELTO significantly slowed the loss of photoreceptors -- light-sensing nerve cells that are critical for central vision -- compared with sham-treated eyes, or eyes that underwent a simulated procedure without receiving actual treatment. In one of the trials, the implant resulted in a 54.8% reduction in the rate of ellipsoid zone loss, a measurable change in retinal structure that signals photoreceptor cell degeneration. The second trial showed a 30.6% reduction in the same measure, which is still statistically significant, though smaller in magnitude.

In addition to changes in retinal cells, the study evaluated several measures of visual function: how well the eye can actually see and perform everyday vision-related tasks. These included microperimetry (a sensitive test of retinal light response) and reading speed. Results from microperimetry showed statistically significant slowing of visual function loss, particularly in the trial where ENCELTO provided greater preservation of photoreceptor cells. However, reading speed and retinal sensitivity outcomes were more mixed, with one trial showing improvement and the other showing no significant difference from the control group.

"These differences highlight just how complex it is to measure functional vision loss in a slow-progressing disease like MacTel," points out Friedlander. "If you look at certain functional outcomes from just one of the trials, they're not statistically significant. But when you pool data from both trials -- which were conducted the same way -- then you see statistically significant results, so we'll continue to investigate what's driving that."

Despite the variability, the overall trend across both trials supports ENCELTO's long-term benefit, particularly when treatment is initiated before extensive cell loss. Participants tolerated the implant well, with minimal side effects. Furthermore, ENCELTO was effective regardless of the participant's baseline vision or disease stage, suggesting that earlier intervention may help preserve more functional vision as MacTel progresses.

Next, Friedlander and his team will assess whether benefits continue or even improve beyond 24 months. There are also plans to explore why some individuals experienced greater gains than others, which may help identify patient subgroups that are most likely to benefit.

"The consistency in preserving retinal cells across both trials gives us confidence in the mechanism," says Friedlander. "As we refine how and when to treat MacTel, we expect even greater improvements in vision over time."

Moreover, because ENCELTO delivers sustained, targeted doses of therapeutic proteins directly to the retina, it represents a versatile platform technology. This same approach could potentially be adapted to treat a wide range of neurovascular degenerative diseases beyond MacTel, including other blinding conditions where protecting vulnerable nerve cells is key.

Chew of the National Institutes of Health; Mark Gillies of the Save Sight Institute; Glenn J.

From mushrooms that cast a soft green glow to plankton that glimmers sparkling blue, glowing plants are nothing new for nature. Now, scientists are bringing that light to houseplants.

Reporting in the Cell Press journal Matter on August 27, researchers crafted glow-in-the-dark succulents that recharge in sunlight. Injected with light-emitting compounds, the plants can shine in various colors and rival a small night light at their brightest. The simple, low-cost method may help lay the foundation for sustainable, plant-based lighting systems.

"Picture the world of Avatar, where glowing plants light up an entire ecosystem," says first author Shuting Liu of South China Agricultural University. "We wanted to make that vision possible using materials we already work with in the lab. Imagine glowing trees replacing streetlights."

Glowing greenery isn't a new idea. Past studies have designed similar plants using genetic engineering. But the glow is often faint and is typically only available in green. The methods were also complex and costly.

Instead of coaxing cells to glow through genetic modification, the team used afterglow phosphor particles -- materials similar to those found in glow-in-the-dark toys. These compounds absorb light and release it slowly over time.

For the particles to travel through leaf tissues, the researchers had to get the size just right: around 7 micrometers, roughly the width of a red blood cell.

"Smaller, nano-sized particles move easily within the plant but are dimmer," says Liu. "Larger particles glowed brighter but couldn't travel far inside the plant."

The team then injected the particles into several plant species, including succulents and non-succulents like golden pothos and bok choy. But only the succulents produced a strong glow, thanks to the narrow, uniform, and evenly distributed channels within the leaf that helped to disperse the particles more effectively. After a couple of minutes of exposure to sunlight or indoor LED light, the modified plants glowed for up to two hours.

"It was really unexpected," says Liu, noting that she initially thought plants with airy tissue structures would perform better. "The particles diffused in just seconds, and the entire succulent leaf glowed."

By using different types of phosphors, the researchers created plants that shine in various colors, including green, red, and blue. They even built a glowing plant wall with 56 succulents, bright enough to illuminate nearby objects and read texts.

"Each plant takes about 10 minutes to prepare and costs a little over 10 yuan (about $1.4), not including labor," says Liu.

The glowing succulents' light fades over time, and the team are still studying the long-term safety of the materials for the plants. Still, the concept could offer a sustainable alternative for low-intensity lighting in pathways, gardens, or indoor decor. The team is also exploring how the method can light up plants beyond succulents.

"I just find it incredible that an entirely human-made, micro-scale material can come together so seamlessly with the natural structure of a plant," says Liu. "The way they integrate is almost magical. It creates a special kind of functionality."

Taco Bell's chief digital officer says the company is having an “active conversation” about when to use and not to use AI.

The company has apparently rolled out voice AI-powered ordering at more than 500 drive-throughs, leading to unflattering viral moments like someone ordering 18,000 water cups in order to “bypass” the AI and get connected to a human server.

Chief Digital and Technology Officer Dane Matthews told The Wall Street Journal that even he has mixed experiences with technology: “Sometimes it lets me down, but sometimes it really surprises me.”

Overall, it sounds like Taco Bell is still deciding how broadly to deploy AI at the drive-through, with leeway for different franchisees to do things their own way. For example, rather than relying on AI exclusively, Matthews said it might make sense to have a human handle drive-through orders at busy restaurants with long lines.

“For our teams, we'll help coach them: at your restaurant, at these times, we recommend you use voice AI or recommend that you actually really monitor voice AI and jump in as necessary,” he said.

On Friday, WhatsApp announced that it had patched a software vulnerability that was being used by unknown hackers to target specific users of Apple products and hack them with spyware.

WhatsApp, which is owned by Meta, said in an advisory that the previously unknown bug “may have been exploited in a sophisticated attack against specific targeted users.” The vulnerability is officially dubbed CVE-2025-55177.

TechCrunch notes that this week, WhatsApp fixed the bug while last week, Apple fixed another bug, known as CVE-2025-43300. Together, these vulnerabilities appear to have been the weak spots that allowed malicious spyware attacks targeting specific Apple users, intended to steal data from their devices, the outlet writes.

Apple describes its bug as such: “Processing a malicious image file may result in memory corruption. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals.” Gizmodo reached out to Apple and WhatsApp for more information.

WhatsApp told TechCrunch that it had notified “less than 200 users” that they may have been impacted by the campaign. Donncha Ó Cearbhaill, head of Amnesty International's Security Lab, said that the notifications had been sent out over the past 90 days. “Our team at Amnesty International's Security Lab is actively investigating cases with a number of individuals targeted in this campaign,” Cearbhaill said on X. “We are available to support members of civil society who have received the WhatsApp notifications.”

Zero-click attacks have become increasingly common and are frightening because, just as the name would suggest, they don't require any active phishing to penetrate into the inner contents of a person's mobile OS. Often, all a bad actor needs to do is send a malicious file (often an image), which can take over the phone by itself. Over the last several years, malware capable of zero-click attacks has been targeted at journalists, activists, and government officials—much of it originating from companies based in Israel.

This week on the GeekWire Podcast: In light of his estate's launch of the new $3.1 billion Fund for Science and Technology, we revisit a classic 2011 interview with the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen to explore the “Idea Man” mindset that continues to shape his legacy. 

The conversation reveals the personal motivations behind his “big bet” philanthropy, his candid thoughts on his partnership with Bill Gates, and his passion for everything from brain science to jamming with rock stars.

As investments in artificial intelligence continue to soar, some analysts are raising alarms about a looming bubble that could burst and trigger broader market declines. Others, however, say they've never been so sure that it is a growing opportunity.

So who is right? Well, on Wall Street, there's a pick-your-flavor opinion for whatever it is you want to back, so we can't determine that. But we can show you what each side is thinking.

Firstly, that the sector is overvalued. Analysts and investors and even company CEOs of AI giants have expressed concerns that current valuations of AI-related stocks may be disconnected from their underlying fundamentals.

The rapid rally in companies involved in AI hardware, software, and infrastructure—including chipmakers, cloud providers, and automation firms—has driven valuations to levels that many consider unsustainable.

Why does that matter? Because everything that goes up must eventually come down.

That means that recent market volatility and warnings from veteran investors suggest that a sudden reassessment of valuations could result in a significant downturn, similar to past technology and internet bubbles.

Secondly, that growth is why those valuations are worth it.

Despite recent concerns about overvaluation and a possible slowdown in AI-related growth, UBS analysts reaffirmed their positive outlook on the sector this week, buoyed by Nvidia's hotly anticipated quarterly results.

In a note released after Nvidia reported earnings that exceeded expectations (but only just barely), UBS said that the core case for AI investment remains intact.

“While valuations might appear stretched in the short term, the fundamental need for AI technology across industries continues to grow,” UBS wrote in a note to investors.

The firm highlighted Nvidia's role as a leader in semiconductor and AI infrastructure, emphasizing that the company's robust revenue growth, which is projected at 48% for the current quarter, is a sign for ongoing demand for AI hardware and software solutions.

Analysts also pointed out that the broader enterprise move toward integrating AI is supported by increasing capital spending, which bodes well for the sector's long-term prospects.

“Investors should maintain conviction,” UBS added, “as the demand for scalable, high-performance AI platforms is only poised to accelerate.”

Market experts agree that while short-term volatility is inevitable, the fundamental structural drivers, such as the adoption of AI in cloud computing, autonomous vehicles, and enterprise AI, suggest the sector's growth story remains robust for the foreseeable future.

Not everyone is as bullish on AI as UBS.

Take OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, a man who is watching billions of dollars being poured into his competitors. Altman caused a major market rout when he said that investors are getting “over-excited” about AI.

“Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are over-excited about AI? My opinion is yes. Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes,” He told The Verge, adding that he thinks that some valuations of AI start-ups are “insane” and “not rational”.

Investors are also increasingly wary after reports that Meta is considering a “downsizing” of its artificial intelligence division, with some executives expected to depart.

This potential shift marks a notable departure from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's recent heavy investments in transforming the company's AI operations.

Over the past few months, Zuckerberg has championed a major overhaul of Meta's AI strategy, emphasizing its critical role in enhancing user experience and competing with rivals like OpenAI and Google.

The New York Times cited sources close to the company, indicating that the restructuring could lead to significant layoffs or a shakeup in leadership.

The planned changes have raised questions among market watchers about whether Meta's aggressive AI ambitions are being reassessed, or if internal challenges are forcing a strategic pivot. The move signals a period of uncertainty for Meta's AI efforts, which had been a key part of Zuckerberg's vision for the company's future growth

While some experts acknowledge the transformative potential of AI, they caution investors to remain vigilant and avoid chasing speculative gains that lack proper valuation.

“The risk is that we are in a man-made bubble that will eventually burst, causing widespread damage,” said industry veteran Michael Johnson.

“Even when the dotcom bubble burst, there were a handful of fairly obvious winners that eventually came roaring back,” said CNBC‘s Jim Cramer. “If you gave up on Amazon in 2001, you missed the $2 trillion (£1.4 trillion) boat.”

Cramer has been investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission at least once, and has also drawn criticism for past comments on market manipulation.

Amazon's Labor Day deals are here, and if you've ever thought about getting a portable power station, now's the perfect time to jump in. These handy devices are great for so many things like keeping your home running during unexpected outages, powering your gadgets while camping or even using at outdoor events. Amazon is offering an enormous 46% discount on Anker Solix C1000 portable power station bundled with a 200W solar panel. That is, you can get the entire package for $699 instead of the usual $1,299. And if you want the power station alone, that also comes down to $449 from $799.

See at Amazon

Let's talk specs: the SOLIX C1000 packs 1800 watts of continuous power, backed by a big 1056Wh LiFePO4 battery. It has enough power to power multiple devices at once – like your fridge and fans, in addition to laptops and phones. The LiFePO4 battery is safer and more long-lasting than your typical lithium-ion batteries, so you can use it every day. It also contains a boost mode that reaches 2400 watts for those appliances which need extra power to start.

The six AC outlets mean you can plug in multiple devices without ever sweating a drop. And the 200W solar panel? That's a giant bonus if you'd rather fill up your power station off the grid – perfect for camping trips or backup use during prolonged outages when you'd rather have clean, quiet power. Just place the solar panel in the sun, and it'll recharge the battery all day long.

You're going to have plenty of output possibilities here, including USB and DC jacks, so it's easy to keep everything powered. It's also very portable with a small footprint and a handle, so you can take it with you wherever you go without a problem. Low battery will never be a hassle again.

Safety-wise, the battery uses LiFePO4 technology that can handle heat and keep its capacity longer. And Anker has integrated protection against overheating, overloading, overcharging, and short circuits – leaving you worry-free. It's a product that's designed to keep you charged and safe.

As a whole, purchasing the Anker Solix C1000 with the solar panel for $699 in Amazon's Labor Day sale is one offer that it's difficult to pass on. The power station alone at $449 is a good bargain too if you don't need the panel outright.

So, what caused the failures?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


There has been news in the latter half of August that Windows update KB5063878 has reportedly been killing SSDs, especially when performing continuous file writes exceeding 50GB on a drive that's at least 60% full. However, after more than a week of investigation, Microsoft confirmed that the aforementioned update was not the cause of the issue. According to Redmond's resolution to the service alert related to the original report, “After thorough investigation, Microsoft has found no connection between the August 2025 Windows security update and the types of hard drive failures reported on social media.”

One user claims that the bug affects how SSDs handle cache, and that models without DRAM and Phison NAND controllers are the most heavily affected. However, their further testing of 21 different SSDs revealed that drives using controllers from other brands seem to be affected as well. Nevertheless, the drives that crashed or disappeared were reportedly recovered after restarting the system, save for the Western Digital SA510 2TB model they tested.

Although the issue does not seem to be widespread, more drama came out when a document containing a list of Phison controllers that were supposedly affected by the problem was widely circulated. The company vehemently denied that the file came from it and said that it would take legal action against the original leaker of the data. Nevertheless, it continued testing, and after 4,500 hours, it stated that it could not reproduce the issue. Still, Phison recommends that users with heavy storage workloads install heatsinks on their SSDs if they haven't already done so to reduce the chances of thermal throttling.

A few days after this, Microsoft also released its conclusion that there's no connection between the failed drives and the security update. It claimed that there was no increased risk of disk failure or file corruption after doing internal testing, and telemetry data also did not yield any meaningful results. Aside from that, the company claimed that no customer has reached out directly to its support teams with this same issue.

Both Phison and Microsoft basically say that they cannot reproduce the issue, with the latter concluding that there was no problem with the update. Nevertheless, we still see a few posts on social media saying that their drive died after installing KB5063878. We're unsure whether this is a pattern or a mere coincidence, especially considering the millions of SSDs in circulation. After all, we've seen big companies deny that there's anything wrong with their products only for us to discover later that there's a major issue with them (like Intel's instability issues).

In the meantime, you should monitor your SSDs, especially if you're writing large files in a storage drive that's more than half full. And if you experience the same problem, it's best to report it to both your drive's manufacturer and to Microsoft so that we can establish a paper trail. That way, we can determine what's really going on with the drives and the security update.

I've been told by dentists and dental hygienists for the better part of my life that I could do a better job of flossing my teeth. It took an interview with a startup founder and the chance to try a unique product for me to finally consider a real change in habits. 

“You're not alone,” said Brynn MacLennan. “Most people do not floss at all, and those that do mostly do it incorrectly. And that's why we invented our product.”

MacLennan is co-founder and CEO of Slate, a Spokane, Wash.-based maker of an electric flosser.

MacLennan has a background as a product designer, and her co-founder and ex-husband Danny Snyder just happens to be a dentist and would-be inventor.

They started working on Slate in 2019, got a patent in 2020, launched a Kickstarter in 2021, and started selling product in November 2022. In 2023, they made $1 million in sales.

Slate, which previously raised $800,000 in seed funding, recently raised another $1.75 million in a second seed round, according to an SEC filing.

MacLennan said when she and Snyder first built Slate, they sent 500 to hygienists and 200 to dentists. They heard back from 95% of them who said they'd recommend the flosser to their patients, and 74% who said it was better than any tool on the market at stimulating the gums.

“When I got that data, I was like, ‘OK we can invest our energy in this,” said MacLennan, a mother of five who now runs the startup on her own.

The device looks and handles like an electric toothbrush, similar to Sonicare. The floss head at the top vibrates at three different speeds and features what Slate calls “Gum Sweeps.” 

“That's what makes our product better than anything else,” MacLennan said of the Sweeps. “These little triangles are what dentists would call an ‘interdental brush' or ‘gum brush.' We call them Gum Sweeps because they're a new design, and we invented them, and this is what's patented on our product.”

The little triangles on either end of the floss are designed to go where your gums and teeth touch, and sonic vibrations from the flosser massage your gums and disrupt plaque.

I use a Sonicare and have been using string floss and pick-style floss to varying degrees of success for years. I get dinged by my hygienist during cleanings every six months, and each time I leave I resolve to do a better job of staying on top of flossing. 

After an initial test drive, the Slate flosser is certainly easier to use than wrapping string around my fingers. I could feel the Gum Sweeps working their way between the base of my teeth and vibrating against the gum line. It didn't hurt, and I didn't bleed the way I sometimes do after traditional flossing. Although, I might be bleeding because I'm not flossing regularly enough.

Slate recommends that the floss heads — available in a variety of colors — be changed every week. The reverse side of the head also doubles as a tongue scraper, apparently to remove even more bacteria. My teenager uses a tongue scraper, which means someone on TikTok has decided tongue scrapers are a thing now.

I took the flosser with me to my six-month dental checkup to show it off to my hygienist and get her opinion about whether such a device is worthwhile.

Kendra Cedana has been cleaning teeth for four years. She hadn't previously seen or used a Slate flosser, but admitted that the device looked “cool” and that that can sometimes be all it takes for people to get into habits they may otherwise avoid.

Cedana watched how I used the flosser and then took her own turn using it on my teeth. 

“The vibration is stimulating the gum, but it's not dislodging any of the plaque,” Cedana said. “You have to still do the physical work of scrub, scrub, scrub.”

Cedana demonstrated with a regular piece of string floss the technique that she would normally use, and it involved six distinct moves that cleaned the sides of my teeth as well as below the gum line.

“Overall, I think manual, traditional flossing is going to be more effective,” Cedana said. “I would say [the Slate flosser] is better than nothing, because at least something's getting through to the contact spot where the teeth come together, where cavities really start.”

We agreed that a humanoid robot powered by AI that comes to my bathroom every night — armed with regular old floss — is something that Cedana should invent.

Along with her hardware ambitions, MacLennan would love to innovate some software functions into the flosser, including the ability to communicate applicable data with high-tech wearables such as the Apple Watch or Oura Ring.

The Slate flosser retails for $119 and a box of 20 floss heads is $25, available direct-to-consumer, on Amazon, and through some dental offices. A three-pack of Oral-B Glide Deep Clean Cool Mint Dental Floss is $10 at Walmart. 

MacLennan said the price of her device, manufactured at factories in China, Taiwan and the Philippines, is likely to go up soon due to President Trump's tariff policies.

She also added that the product should be coming to a “popular retailer” soon, thanks to a deal that's in the works with a company she could not yet name.

There has to be a laptop that does it all and won't break my back as I haul it around town. I'm sure every mobile-minded gamer has asked themselves that question and come away without a good answer. The one arena I keep coming back to is the 14-inch gaming laptop. Today's tiny beasts have the performance necessary to keep up with 16- or 18-inch laptop without needing to lug around a huge chunk of aluminum. What's not to like? Here's the kicker: it's only getting more expensive to achieve the perfect compact gaming laptop. The 2025 edition of the Razer Blade 14 is our latest and best example of how improved design is engendering ever-higher prices for already expensive products.

Today's best compact gaming laptops now cost closer to what we used to spend for larger, hardier portable machines just a few years ago. Razer's Blade 14 (2025) is the epitome of today's tariffs-enabled price gouging. The laptop starts at $2,300 MSRP with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060. The model you want, with a GPU capable of maxing out some demanding games at the laptop's peak resolution, demands $2,600. That's $100 more than the starting price of the 2024 Blade 14. Currently, the Blade 14 (2025) is on sale through Razer's website for closer to $2,300. It could stay at that price permanently, but I can only suspect that with Trump's asinine tariff talk, gadgets can only ever get more expensive.

Razer Blade 14 (2025)

The Razer Blade 14 (2025) is so slim and still packs strong gaming/non-gaming performance. You'll just have to get used to its odd trackpad first.

Pros

Cons

The Razer Blade 14's main competition is last year's favorite, the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 gaming laptop, now with Nvidia RTX 50-series GPUs. Last year's version asked for around $2,000 with a GeForce RTX 4070. Today's latest Zephyrus model will demand the same price for a better RTX 5070 Ti GPU and an AMD Ryzen AI 9 270. The two 14-inch gaming laptops are neck and neck, but the Blade 14 (2025) muscles space for itself in a crowded market due to a few quality-of-life features and excellent thermal management. We can have nice things and the Blade 14 (2025) proves that. We'll just have to spend more and more every year to cling onto our quality computers. If you're looking for something that may cost less, you could search for an Asus TUF Gaming A14 that could clock in at less than $2,000.

Despite the recent controversy with buggy hardware and software on the Razer Blade 16, I experienced little of the claimed performance issues with the Blade 14 (2025). However, I had noticed crashes when exiting games before I made sure to download the latest firmware. After that, the laptop was smooth sailing save for all the regular issues I have with Windows 11. There's a part of me that wishes Razer would step out of its comfort zone. The gaming brand refuses to make another Blade Stealth with that calming pink tone, so we're left with the company's usual black box and its big, glowing Razer logo stenciled on the lid. Past 14-inch models like the 2021 design could pack up to an RTX 3080-level GPU (and those cost less than today's RTX 5070 model). For such a slim design, the performance you get with the modern $2,300 model is exactly what you need for a device of this size.

The new Razer Blade 14 is smaller than last year's model, but by such a minimal degree you'd have to squint to tell the difference. It's 0.66 inches at its thickest point. Slipping this laptop into a backpack is likely one of my greatest pleasures despite the fact you'll still need to haul around the hefty 200W power brick if you plan to play your favorite games. Though the Blade 14 (2025) weighs in at 3.59 pounds, it will feel slightly heavier than many other thin-and-light laptop designs. That's to be expected, and it's a tradeoff I'd take with a smile on my face. The new Blade 14 is the kind of device that offers the mobility you can only dream of when trying to haul a 16-inch beast around.

The Blade 14 (2025)is a more subtle notebook than either the Razer Blade 16 or Blade 18. Yes, the rear panel and the triple-snake logo glow nuclear green during use, but without any bottom RGB you can get away with keeping it next to you in a crowded college auditorium so long as you remember to turn off the bright, per-key RGB lights. Using the Blade 14 (2025) would be smooth sailing after that if only Razer would spend more time paying attention to the overall feel of its personal computers. Like all its other anodized aluminum matte black laptops, the new Blade 14 is a smudge magnet. The lid and palm rests will be first to look grody with enough manhandling. The keys will soon develop unsightly smears, whether or not you dip your digits into the odd Fritos bag. At the very least, the Blade 14 (2025) comes with a great selection of I/O ports. Besides the proprietary charging port and headphone jack, you'll get a USB 4 Type-C and USB-A on either side of the device. There's an additional HDMI 2.1 and microSD card slot, which came in handy for on-the-go video editing.

It took me longer to get used to the feel of both the keyboard and trackpad. I had to give the laptop some leeway after fawning so hard for the Alienware 16 Area-51 and its full mechanical keyboard, but after enough time I could start to appreciate the Razer laptop's thin keys even though I'd prefer something with more clacky sounds and travel. There's a good deal of separation between each key to avoid any misclicks and I never felt like my fingers had to reorient to find the right key without looking. The keyboard has a small amount of feedback response with every key press—better than the squishy feel that turned me off the HP Omen Max 16. It's enough to make the Blade 14 (2025) worth typing on—more than your average Apple Magic Keyboard. Those who want a thin, mobile device can't ask for much better, even if I may dream of something more.

Compared to the keyboard, the new Blade 14's trackpad is a hate-hate design. The large panel is flat and does a good job at palm rejection (a problem I've had on previous Razer Blade models). The issue is the interior of the trackpad is sloped toward the end facing the user. That means if you try to click toward the top of the pad, you won't be able to register any depth outside capacitive touch. Scrolling to the top of a webpage will result in the odd sensation where you press into the trackpad to click, but then get no response. If you're like me, and you want haptic feedback on your clicks, you're forced to press down toward the bottom of the trackpad.

With enough time, I could find a rhythm that would make the Razer Blade 14 (2025) my main PC for work and pleasure. It's in that mold that the refreshed gaming laptop hits its home run. The notebook can do everything I want and look good while doing it.

My edition of the Razer Blade 14 (2025) came packed an AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 CPU along with 32GB of RAM (soldered to the device, so no upgrading, unfortunately). That processor is a 10-core, 20-thread CPU based on the chipmaker's latest Strix Point Zen 5 microarchitecture. Suffice it to say, the Strix Point CPU series is built for smaller laptops with lower power demand. and it's proved very effective in notebooks like last year's Asus TUF Gaming A14 when paired with a discrete GPU. In the case of the Blade 14 (2025), that's the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 running at 115W TGP, or total graphics power. This is a higher power draw than some laptops, such as the upcoming Framework Laptop 16, and it promises to eek out more performance than some competing designs.

After downloading the latest drivers and firmware through Razer Synapse (a must if you want to avoid any odd issues that would stall when exiting games), the Blade 14 (2025) performed as well as can be expected in synthetic benchmarks. It easily beats out the 2024 small frame competitors, especially in Geekbench 6 and Cinebench 2024 multi-core tests, but it can't stand toe-to-toe with its larger cousins sporting higher-end gaming laptop CPUs like the Intel Core Ultra HX line. The Blade 14 (2025) didn't even get into the same ballpark of a 14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 in these tests. In multiple 3DMark, the new Blade 14 will sit a few thousand points below laptops with an RTX 5080. Instead, it proved an incredibly balanced machine capable of hitting high frame rates in multiple games I tested, better than 2024's best examples of 14-inchers.

The Blade 14 (2025) will meet its match when you try pushing ray tracing settings. Games like Black Myth: Wukong survive ray tracing with their automatic DLSS settings picking up the slack. The sweet spot in a game like Cyberpunk 2077 is to stick ray tracing on low settings with DLSS on auto, which can net around 65 fps in benchmarks and a little less in gameplay. Without DLSS, you'll get slightly more than 40 fps in those same scenarios, the same as if you set it to DLSS Ultra settings. A game such as Marvel's Spider-Man 2—already a difficult game to run on most PCs—will struggle to achieve playable frame rates at the Blade 14's max resolution. Even when relying on DLSS, you may need to supress the inclination to dial up graphics and ray tracing settings to high if you even hope to play at a minimum 30 fps.

All of that, plus the laptop rarely felt more than slightly warm under my palms. With a laser thermometer, the Blade 14 (2025) surface temperature near the screen read around 103 degrees Fahrenheit but only 85 degrees on the palm rest. Even during play, the gaming laptop didn't make my fingers toasty, and it kept the heat away from the sides where I'd use a mouse (better to avoid the trackpad issues altogether).

Though I have not tried the version with an RTX 5060, that GPU will necessarily limit how hard you can push your games on the Blade 14. Gamers have a one track mind. The first and last thing they care about is whether a device can run the latest titles with all the fixings—all settings on Ultra and ray tracing turned up—and still maintain a 60 fps or higher frame rate. Inevitably, the Blade 14 (2025) will find its limits.

We've had enough months to settle in with Nvidia's GPU lineup. Long gone is any talk that the desktop RTX 5070 would somehow be more powerful than the RTX 4090, the previous-gen flagship. The laptop variant of this GPU is designed for smaller devices such as the Blade 14 (2025) with its limited resolution and refresh rate. Even if you push a game to hit double-digit frame rates with 50-series exclusive multi-frame gen—which inserts AI generated frames between rendered frames to artificially increase performance—the Blade 14 (2025) isn't going to represent them on-screen with a mere 120Hz display. Instead, Nvidia has tried to showcase other uses for its RTX 50-series GPUs beyond downloading yet another game from your overstuffed Steam library centering on the new Blade 14.

I normally run a Blender test with my laptops, where I guage how long it takes the program to render a scene with a car on both the CPU and GPU. Despite the strength of AMD's Strix Point, the Blade 14 (2025) will still not be as fast as the M4 in a 14-inch MacBook Pro. A discrete GPU will render such scenes three times as fast as the latest MacBook's GPU, though that's a difference of 17 seconds versus 55. Nvidia's latest GPU's also support improved video encoding features on top of the normal rendering enhancements from a discrete GPU. All that sounds well and good for specific workflows, but you'll have to wrestle with the battery issues common to all gaming laptops of this caliber. Relying on the Blade 14's Strix Point integrated GPU to save on battery will leave you dissapointed. In our Blender test, the Blade 14 (2025) was barely a minute faster on the AMD Radeon 880 graphics than running directly on the CPU.

Past Razer Blade 14 models could support screens with higher refresh rates up to 165Hz. Compared to that, the Blade 14 (2025) may seem more humdrum. The new laptop packs an OLED display with 2,880 x 1,800 resolution and a max of 120Hz refresh rate. Some may look at the price and wonder why we couldn't have better refresh rates, but the display manages to strike a balance between speeds and pretty visuals.

The Blade 14 (2025)'s OLED display is the kind of pretty that's so standard now among higher-end devices. It's a good thing then, that the display is so especially nice to look at. The added bonus is Razer pushed the side and top screen bezels farther to the edge, maximizing the space I use to bask in those deep blacks promised by organic light-emitting diode displays.

This screen type offers better blacks and contrast than other competing displays. The main drawback is they are normally dimmer than other screens with a backlight, like mini LED. I never had a situation where I couldn't see the screen in a dark room or where a bright light drowned out what was happening. Instead, the screen is a little too reflective. When you load dark colors onto the screen, the Blade 14 (2025) is so mirror-like I could read my own shirt. The reflectivity never proved so bad it distracted me from work or gaming, but it could be a major hassle if your attention tends to stray.

This laptop is also a great machine for most of your streaming content. The Blade 14 (2025) has a six speakers with support for THX spatial audio. Sound from the laptop came through clear and accurate. I wasn't left grabbing for the nearest pair of high-quality headphones even when watching YouTube videos or loading up a game with my favorite soundtrack. Listening to in-game sound is even better thanks to its very minimal fan noise. The new Blade 14's secret weapon is not necessarily its components, but the fact that everything runs so smoothly without any obtrusive noise to distract you.

Gaming laptops continue to have severe battery life issues. Even if you eschew any more hardcore programs and only use this laptop to browse the web, you'll never achieve anything close to a full-day of battery life. The Blade 14 (2025) doesn't break that trend, but it does better than most.

In practice, the laptop can maintain itself on the default balanced power settings off-plug for a little more than four hours. After that, the it was begging for a charger. That number was consistent over weeks using the new Blade 14. The laptop would much rather you work with a plug nearby. With the 200W power brick connected to the its proprietary charging port, I could go from near 20% to almost full in under 40 minutes. I prefer to travel light, in which case I sometimes left the charger at work just so I didn't have to carry it around with me.

In the end, even the most mobile gaming laptops will still be limited in just how easy it is to bring them around. The Blade 14 (2025) is simply slightly better than most, and in that way it's one of my favorite laptops of the year. Despite all my hangups with its trackpad and keyboard, it's the kind of device I wish I could keep close by, though perhaps out of a sense of entitlement after paying well over $2,000 for it.

CPUs are going the way of GPUs?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


When we first encountered AMD SP7 rumors a couple of years ago, we imagined that this platform would increase the power consumption of AMD's future CPUs to levels beyond 1,000W (1 kW), so when we learnt that Auras was developing cold plates for SP7 processors at Computex this year, we were not surprised. One thing was missing, though: the actual power consumption number for these CPUs. Apparently, Zen 6-based codenamed Venice processors with up to 256 cores could have a peak power consumption of up to 1,400W (1.4 kW), according to a presentation found by HXL. 

AMD's current range-topping EPYC 9965 with 192 Zen 5 cores has a TDP of 500W (but a peak power consumption of around 700W), but judging from an OCP APAC Summit presentation, at least one of the company's partners — Taiwan Microloops Corp. — is preparing for a rather dramatic increase in SP7 CPU peak power consumption compared to existing processors. TMC appears to be developing custom cooling hardware for SP7 CPUs: a dual-loop water cooling system capable of handling thermal loads of around 1,400W. 

 




One slide from Taiwan Microloops Corp. showcases a thermal solution for AMD's SP7 socket, designed to cool CPUs with power levels of up to 1,400W. It depicts a dual-loop liquid cooling system using PG25 coolant, operating at a flow rate of 1 liter per minute. The system includes a cold plate mounted on the processor, a pump, a reservoir, a plate heat exchanger, and a chiller set to 17°C. Heat is absorbed at the cold plate and transferred through a primary loop to the heat exchanger, where it is offloaded to a secondary loop connected to the chiller, ensuring sustained thermal performance at extremely high CPU power levels. 

The two charts by TMC confirm the system's efficiency and stability (i.e., it has been tested, although it is unclear whether on real Venice CPUs or heaters). One graph shows that thermal resistance remains nearly constant (~0.009°C/W) across loads ranging from 700 W to 1,400 W, demonstrating effective heat removal regardless of power level. Another chart shows a similarly stable pressure drop (~0.25 – 0.3 bar), indicating that the coolant flow remains unobstructed even under maximum load, which demonstrates that the cooling solution is viable for long-term use. Together, these results demonstrate that AMD's SP7 platform is engineered to reliably support kilowatt-class CPUs without degradation in thermal or hydraulic performance. 

One thing to note is that the 1,400W figure associated with AMD's SP7 platform and next-generation EPYC processors does not definitively indicate their TDP. Instead, it more likely reflects peak power consumption under full load or stress conditions, not the base TDP. 

One interesting thing to note about the presentation is that Taiwan Microloops Corp. is preparing standard coolant distribution units (CDUs) with refrigeration capacities ranging from 60 kW to 800 kW, which are suitable for full-rack or multi-rack liquid cooling deployments. To some degree, this means that liquid cooling has a long road ahead of it before immersion cooling becomes a viable option several years down the road.

Sudokoo is a new cooling brand from Singapore that we first encountered at CES 2025, where it unveiled an initial lineup of AIOs, fans, and air coolers. We're taking a look at one of those products today: the Proteus 360.

The Proteus 360 is an especially powerful AIO in our testing, as you'll see in our benchmarks section – and it stands out from the crowd with a 3.4-inch display that can be customized to show a variety of performance metrics or a video of your choosing using the company's MasterCraft software suite.

Will this new cooler make our list of best CPU coolers on the market? It carries a price tag of $269 USD, so the bar for what we expect from this cooler is set high. We'll first go over the features of this cooler, then get to the benchmarks with AMD and Intel CPUs so that you can determine if this cooler is right for you.

The cooler arrives in a colorful package that shows off the design of the unit.

 




The contents are protected inside of the box with molded foam, more colorful cardboard, and plastic coverings. The package contains the following:

 




▶️ 3.4-inch 480x480 LCD display

The biggest thing that stands out with the Proteus 360 AIO is the 3.4-inch LCD display, which can be customized with Sudokoo's MasterCraft software suite. Higher-end AIOs have been shipping with screens for years now, but usually with smaller screens that are hard to see or read from inside the case. At 3.4 inches, the display here is bigger than most, but not all, of the competition.

▶️ MasterCraft software suite

 




To customize the Sudokoo AIO, you'll need to download the MasterCraft software and open the “Devices” section. From there, you'll have two options – one section for the Proteus linker allows you to control the fan and pump speeds, the other lets you customize the cooler's LCD display.

 




The default configuration runs in “Office Mode,” which generally limits sound levels to less than 38.2 dBA. A “silent mode” is also available, where the fans rarely spin up. And of course, there's a performance profile for those who want maximum cooling. Those who want full control over the fan or pump speeds can click the “Pro” button to enable detailed tuning.

 




The display of the AIO can show up to nine different metrics at one time. You can choose from GPU load, GPU frequency, GPU temp, CPU temp, CPU load, CPU frequency, network statistics, RAM usage, the current time, and the RPM levels of the pump or fans (shown below).

 




The size of each metric can also be changed. In the example above, the CPU load metric takes up four squares so that it is prominent on the display, whereas the other metrics are limited to a single square. Many of these metrics can also be displayed in graphs (shown below).

 




You can also upload animated images or movie files to be shown on the display, if that interests you.

▶️ Proteus Linker

Attached to the side of the AIO is Sudokoo's Proteus Linker, a hub that controls the operation of the AIO. It also features two extra ports that can be used to control the PWM and ARGB settings of other fans not connected to the AIO.

 




▶️ High-quality Intel backplate

Many coolers include backplates barely strong enough to do the job, but not Sudokoo includes an overbuilt backplate that is solid and sturdy. This appears to be the same backplate used by DeepCool in its Assassin VC Elite – though with one difference: DeepCool's implementation has a layer added to the top.

 




▶️ High-quality Intel backplate

Thermal paste is pre-installed on the Sudokoo AIO, saving users a few moments during the installation process.

 




▶️ 30mm thick fans with Zero-RPM mode

 




There are a few features worth mentioning about the fans included with the Proteus 360. Users who prefer silence will be happy to know these fans support zero-RPM operation – and while running the cooler in its silent mode, the fans will often remain turned off! The fans have nine blades and are thicker than normal – measuring 30mm instead of the typical 25mm. This usually means improved performance, but can also lead to compatibility issues in cramped cases. So make sure your case has room for thicker fans before buying this cooler.Sudokoo ships the cooler with the fans pre-installed for convenience.

The installation of the cooler is fairly simple for AMD systems – but it's somewhat of a pain on Intel systems because the backplate of the cooler must be held in place during the install process.

Before starting the install, I highly recommend connecting the cables of the Proteus Linker hub and securing the radiator to your computer to simplify things.

 




1. You'll first need to apply the included backplate if you're using an Intel CPU. AMD users, as usual, will have to remove the default mounting mechanism.

2. Next, you'll need to install the standoffs. This is a simple task on AMD systems, but you'll need to hold the backplate in place until the cooler is secured on Intel systems, unless you choose to add some double-sided tape to the inside of the backplate before installing.

 




3. Next, you'll need to attach the appropriate mounting bars to the bottom of the CPU block.

 




4. Place the CPU block on top of the standoffs, and then secure it with the included screws.

 




5. Place the LCD display on top of the CPU block.

 




6. Finally, connect the PWM and USB cables to your motherboard.

Installation is now complete. Power on your computer and you're good to go.

 




My results may differ from other reviewers because I emphasize results that are comparable to real-world use. This means I test CPU coolers inside a closed desktop case, which increases cooling difficulty compared to other testing methods.

Many sites test CPU coolers outside of a case, on an open test bench. Open benches have lowered ambient temperatures, which in turn makes weak coolers appear stronger than they really are.

Some publications have used generic thermal plates to test cooling solutions. I reject both of these methods because they don't accurately reflect the real-world conditions where a CPU cooler is used.

There are many factors other than the CPU cooler that can influence your cooling performance, including the case you use and the fans installed in it. A system's motherboard can also influence this, especially if it suffers from bending, which results in poor cooler contact with the CPU.

In order to prevent bending from impacting our cooling results, we've installed Thermalright's LGA 1700 contact frame into our testing rig. If your motherboard is affected by bending, your thermal results will be worse than those shown below. Not all motherboards are affected equally by this issue. I tested Raptor Lake CPUs in two motherboards. And while one of them showed significant thermal improvements after installing Thermalright's LGA1700 contact frame, the other motherboard showed no difference in temperatures whatsoever! Check out our review of the contact frame for more information.

We've recently added testing of AMD's new flagship sixteen-core Ryzen 9 9950X3D. This impressive CPU provides the best gaming and multithreaded performance on the market, and it can prove quite challenging thermally, particularly when PBO is enabled for overclocking.

Antonio Gracias, Elon Musk's close ally and Tesla (TSLA) board member, has pivoted to a controversial takeover of Lykos Therapeutics, a biotech firm developing MDMA-based therapies once rejected by the FDA for safety concerns, The Guardian reports.

As the psychedelics industry inches toward mainstream acceptance, new developments reveal how politics, science, and industry interests are shaping the future of mental health treatments.

But Gracias' involvement in the regulatory body of the company he is now boosting is raising eyebrows, The Guardian reports.

Lykos, which announced a $50 million recapitalization earlier this year, has been at the front of pioneering some of the most promising research into MDMA-assisted therapy. But the firm's recent FDA rejection of its clinical trials, which cited flaws linked to bias and trial design, has cast doubt on its prospects for approval.

Thanks largely to debates about scientific rigor, the agency ordered new Phase 3 testing, a process likely to take several years and cost millions.

The company's opponents argue that flawed science led to the rejection, while supporters believe in the therapeutic potential of MDMA under proper regulation.

Neither Lykos nor Gracias responded to a request for comment.

Gracias's recent leadership of Lykos, financed with a $50 million infusion backed by wealthy investors including hedge funds and veteran executives, arrives as Republican and Democratic officials alike are warming to the idea of faster approval for psychedelic medicines.

Some top Trump-era health officials, such as former officials and lawmakers, have publicly supported reevaluating the regulatory process, citing promising early results and patient demand.

This is raising alarm bells with ethics experts.

“You can't be greasing the wheels and then say, ‘OK, now I'm going to quit and go pursue that approval,'” said Cynthia Brown, senior ethics counsel at the non-profit watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told The Guardian.

This political backing fuels concerns about politicizing the science. Critics warn that relaxing FDA standards or fast-tracking approvals under the influence of industry insiders could undermine the integrity of scientific research, risking future setbacks if safety is compromised.

“The challenge is ensuring that enthusiasm doesn't outpace the evidence,” As Mason Marks, a Harvard law professor specializing in drug policy, told The Guardian. “Science must remain independent from politics to avoid bringing the entire industry into disrepute.”

Meanwhile, Gracias's ties to Musk and the military, along with his past work in government, have raised questions about conflicts of interest amid the push for regulatory reform.

The FDA now has broad discretion to reconsider its previous decisions, potentially issuing emergency authorizations or expedited reviews, creating opportunities for firms like Lykos to accelerate their path to market.

“Maps and Gracias are going to try to seize the moment that we're in,” Ifetayo Harvey, a former Maps employee and executive director of the People of Color Psychedelic Collective, said. “I think the aim is to get MDMA-assisted psychotherapy approved by the FDA by any means necessary.”

Gracias' involvement raises quite a few questions for the burgeoning psychedelics industry.

It stands at a crossroads: Whether to forge ahead under politicized but promising conditions or to proceed cautiously to ensure long-term safety and efficacy. As political figures harness deepening public interest in mental health and wellness, industry insiders and regulators face a delicate balance between hope and harm, progress and prudence.

“With the lack of transparency, it leaves us really grasping at what it even means to be Doge,” said Faith Williams, a policy director at the Project on Government Oversight, a non-profit watchdog group, told The Guardian.. “We have seen so many, if not outright conflicts of interest then potential for conflicts of interest, and if not outright corruption, potential for corruption.”

Rick Doblin, founder and president of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) and a prominent, longtime advocate for the research and therapeutic use of psychedelic drugs. Doblin said he immediately saw a partnership.

“It was the magic of Burning Man,” Doblin said. “I was sort of looking for a white knight that would come in and would be more focused on healing and on public benefit.”

That spring, Lykos Therapeutics has announced a major leadership shakeup, appointing a new CEO and chief medical officer and restructuring its board of directors. These moves arrived as Gracias and investor Christopher Hohn assumed control.

“Gracias is actively involved in the company's day-to-day operations,” an unnamed Map director and industry insider, told The Guardian. They said that was emphasizing the influence Gracias now wields over the firm's strategic direction as it aims to regain regulatory confidence and accelerate clinical trials.

This leadership shift underscores the high stakes and intense industry interest in psychedelics, with supporters and critics alike watching closely as the company navigates complex regulatory and scientific hurdles.

But even more unusually, backers of the the company have been accused of a fundraising effort that allegedly involved doing drugs with investors.

“Definitely part of their fundraising strategy is ‘Meet rich people at Burning Man, do psychedelics with them and get Maps money,'” Harvey, who was Doblin's executive assistant in 2015, told The Guardian.

Maps denied that it used drugs to as a means of drumming up investment.

“MAPS conducts all fundraising activities with the highest integrity and maintains strict ethical boundaries in all donor relationships and fundraising activities. MAPS does not supply controlled substances at any events or gatherings, nor do we use substances as a fundraising tool or strategy,” Maps said in a statement.

Doblin also told Business Insider last year that giving drugs to donors was “not common”.

One of the lesser-known apps in the Google Drive online suite is Google Forms. It's an easy, intuitive way to create a web form for other people to enter information into. You can use it for employee surveys, for organizing social gatherings, for giving people a way to contact you, and much more. But Google Forms can also be used for malicious purposes.

These forms can be created in minutes, with clean and clear formatting, official-looking images and video, and—most importantly of all—a genuine Google Docs URL that your web browser will see no problem with. Scammers can then use these authentic-looking forms to ask for payment details or login information.

It's a type of scam that continues to spread, with Google itself issuing a warning about the issue in February. Students and staff at Stanford University were among those targeted with a Google Forms link that asked for login details for the academic portal there, and the attack beat standard email malware protection.

Google Forms are quick and easy to put together.

These scams can take a variety of guises, but they'll typically start with a phishing email that will try to trick you into believing it's an official and genuine communication. It might be designed to look like it's from a colleague, an administrator, or someone from a reputable organization.

The apparent quality and trustworthiness of this original phishing email is part of the con. Our inboxes are regularly filled with requests to reset passwords, verify details, or otherwise take action. Like many scams, the email might suggest a sense or urgency, or indicate that your security has been compromised in some way.

Even worse, the instigating email might actually come from a legitimate email address, if someone in your social circle, family, or office has had their account hijacked. In this case you wouldn't be able to run the usual checks on the sender identity and email address, because everything would look genuine—though the wording and style would be off.

This email (or perhaps a direct message on social media) will be used to deliver a Google Forms link, which is the second half of the scam. This form will most often be set up to look genuine, and may be trying to spoof a recognized site like your place of work or your bank. The form might prompt you for sensitive information, offer up a link to malware, or feature a phone number or email address to lead you into further trouble.

As mentioned above, Google Forms are hosted on Google's servers, so there are no red flags in that respect. It's also easy for scammers to quickly close and reopen these forms on different random URLs, making it harder for them to be caught by security software. Since they're free to create, scammers aren't losing anything by making vast numbers of them.

Part of the form involved in the Stanford scam.

The same set of common sense measures are usually enough to keep yourself safe against most scams, including this one. Be wary of any unexpected communications, like unusual requests for friends or password reset processes you haven't yourself triggered. If you're unsure, check with the sender of the email (be it your bank or your boss) by calling them, rather than relying on what's said in the email.

In general, you shouldn't be entering any login information or payment details into a Google Forms document (it will start with docs.google.com in your browser's address bar). These forms may look reasonably well presented, but they'll lack any advanced formatting or layouts, and will feature Submit and Clear form buttons at the bottom.

Google Forms should also have either a “never submit passwords” or “content is neither created nor endorsed by Google” message at the bottom, depending on how the form has been set up. These are all signs you can look for, even if the link to the form appears to have come from a trusted source. And if you're being asked for important information, then get in touch with that source directly.

All forms created through Google Forms have a Report button at the bottom you can use if you think you've spotted a scam. If you've already submitted information before you've realized what's going on, the standard safeguarding measures apply: Change your passwords as soon as you can, and notify whoever is running the account that may have been compromised that you might need help.

Even just knowing that this kind of scam exists is a step toward being better protected. As always, keeping your mobile and desktop software up-to-date helps too. This won't necessarily flag a suspect form, for the reasons we've already mentioned, but it should mean that any malicious links you're directed to are recognized.

For those times when you can't find a USB flash drive.

Transferring files is something that we take for granted thanks to super-cheap USB storage and fast network connections. Every single reader has had an occasion where they needed to transfer files, and I bet most of us have just reached for a USB flash drive (perhaps one of the best flash drives).

That tried-and-trusted method is just one way to transfer files, but what if there were alternatives? I'm not talking about Iomega Zip drives (I miss those!) or floppy disks (those too!) I'm talking about direct file transfer between machines on the same network.

Lets start with one of the most useful and simple methods. Luckily, it's baked directly into Python, which you can run on your OS of choice – but we'll be focusing on Windows for this tutorial.

Yes, Python has its own web / file server baked into the standard Python library. Best of all, it is really easy to use.

You will need to have Python installed on your computer. Linux users will have this by default, and Windows users should follow our guide on how to install Python.

1. Find your IP address by first going to Settings >> Network & Internet, and click on Properties.

 




2. Scroll down to the Properties section and make a note of your IP address.

3. Click on the Windows logo and search for Command prompt and press Enter to open.

 




4. Navigate to the directory from which you wish to share files. I've put a load of test files in the folder.

 




5. Run the command to start the server. Rather than starting an interactive Python session, this will start the Python interpreter and run the web server module from the standard Python library.

 




6. When prompted, allow access through your firewall. 

 




7. On another device, open a web browser and visit the IP address, add :8000 to the end. You will see the files in the directory, and the Command Prompt will update to show the HTTP requests made as files are downloaded.

 




8. To end the session, on the “server” press CTRL+C to stop the running command.

 




Created by 9001, Copyparty is a rather wonderful tool that turns almost any device capable of running Python into a file server. I'm not just talking about a simple file server here (though it does that too); it can also serve video to your devices directly from the browser, shrink downloads into ZIPs, create RSS feeds to track folder changes, and become an FTP or TFTP server. All you need is one file to make it happen, but Copyparty can be tweaked with an external config file should you want to perform more advanced tasks.

You will need to have Python installed on your computer. Linux users will have this by default, and Windows users should follow our guide on how to install Python.

We'll start with the most basic Copyparty setup: dropping one Python file in the directory that we want to share, and then running the file.

1. Download copyparty-sfx.py [direct download] from the Github repository.

2. Copy the file to the directory that you wish to share.

3. Open a Command Prompt / Terminal and run the Python file using the Python interpreter.

4. Check the output for the IP address of the server, and make a note of it and the port number, typically 3923.

5. On another computer, open a web browser and enter the IP address and port number for the Copyparty server. Mobile users can use the QR code to quickly open the Copyparty interface.

 




Copyparty, at its most basic level, is accessed from any web browser (even Netscape 4.0, it claims!) and it provides a list of the files and directories inside the directory that you are sharing. You cannot go into any directories that are outside of the shared directory.

Lets take a look at the interface.

 




1. Toolbar submenu: Here, we can see the icons for

2. Directory Tree: Show the directory structure where the Copyparty server is running from.

3. File Manager: Shows the files and directories hosted by the Copyparty server. Note that column C refers to the filetype. Directories appear as Zip archives in the file manager.

To open a file, simply click on it. This mostly triggers the browser to download the file, but for PDF, Images etc, the file will open in the browser. To directly download the file, right click and select Save As.



Media files can be played / previewed directly in the browser. So if you want to watch a movie or listen to music without installing any players, Copyparty will handle serving the media, and your browser will do the rest.

You'll have full read/write permissions for the Copyparty server, and that means you can upload directly to the server from the browser.

1. Using your OS file manager, locate the files/directories that you wish to upload and drag them into the Copyparty browser window.

2. Drop the files/directories onto Upload, and click OK to confirm.



1. On the machine running Copyparty, press CTRL + C to end the running command. Alternatively, closing the terminal window will stop the server.

Copyparty is insanely useful and powerful. It could easily be used as the basis of a simple home server or used externally via a service such as Cloudflare. With Copyparty you can build the following servers.

You just need an old, beat-up laptop (or any system) and some USB storage to make your own server. To take advantage of these features, you'll need to delve into the extensive, well-written Copyparty documentation and follow the path for the server that you wish to create.

When it's time to wind down, even a thin beam of streetlight coming through the curtains or the glow of a phone charger can keep your brain from fully switching off. A well-made sleep mask that blocks the light can help you drift off faster and stay asleep even through sunrise.

So forget those flimsy airline eye covers. Sleep masks have come a long way, and the market is filled with a myriad of options designed to help you fall asleep and maintain a good night's rest. From luxurious silk masks to high-tech sleeping goggles, there's a sleep mask for every need. Below, we break down what to look for in a sleep mask, the benefits each type offers, and how to get the most out of one so you can sleep like you mean it.

Don't know where to start when it comes to purchasing a sleep mask for your needs? We're here to break down all the things you should consider.

For better sleep all around, check out our guide to the Best Sleep Masks, as well as other sleep-related guides, including Best Mattresses, Best Sheets, Best Pillows, and Best Organic Mattresses.

Sleep masks do more than just block out light. Whether you're jet-lagged, catching up after a night shift, or simply looking to improve your nightly routine, the benefits of a sleep mask can be long-lasting after a good night's rest.

Light is the most powerful cue for your circadian rhythm. It essentially tells your brain what time it is. Even the tiniest bit of light exposure can suppress melatonin and delay sleep.

“Most research has been conducted in hospitals due to the noise and lights,” says sleep physician Lourdes DelRosso. “Providing sleep masks and earplugs to hospitalized patients has been studied and published, showing that patients experience deeper and more restful sleep. Just by covering their eyes, we can promote better production of melatonin and send better signals to our brain.” Wearing sleep masks at night can also aid cognitive function, including memory, alertness, and episodic learning, according to a study from the Sleep Research Society.

Wearing sleep masks at night can also aid cognitive function, including memory, alertness, and episodic learning, according to a study from the Sleep Research Society.

And it's not just the blackout effect of sleep masks that gives users a well-rested night. Sleep masks are a healthy sleep association, providing a relaxing and comforting experience that can help you wind down at night.

“We have touch receptors everywhere on our skin, including around the eyes,” certified sleep expert Annika Carroll says. “If we apply a little bit of light pressure there with this mask, it releases a hormone called oxytocin, often referred to as the love hormone. It promotes relaxation and comfort.”

If you're prone to migraines, eye masks can be a simple and powerful ally. Light pressure around the eyes can help ease tension and increase blood flow, while total darkness helps reduce light sensitivity, a common migraine trigger.

Friction breaks down the skin's elastin and collagen, the proteins that keep your face firm and smooth. Wearing an eye mask while you sleep protects the delicate skin around your eyes from rubbing against bedding or your arm, especially if you tend to toss and turn.

We all know the signs of a rough night of sleep: puffy eyes and dark circles. A sleep mask can help tip the odds by boosting circulation in your face, and weighted eye masks can help break up the excess fluid around the eyes that leads to puffiness.

Sleep mask fits aren't universal, Carroll says: “I find that there's a bit of trial and error in finding a mask that fits your face shape. There are rounder faces, and there are slimmer, longer faces.” Be sure to try on a new sleep mask before giving it a whirl; the mask should press gently against your face without feeling too tight, and there should be no gaps between the mask and your skin, especially around the nose. Additionally, several sleep mask characteristics may affect how well it fits on your face.

Flat sleep masks are the most traditional type you'll see—a flat piece of fabric that covers the eyes. These types are generally lighter and more compact, making them easy to travel with. Comfort may be a factor here, since flat masks tend to press against the eyes, which some may find bothersome.

A common problem with traditional slip-on sleep masks is the bridge of the nose lifting the mask, allowing light to seep in and defeating the purpose of wearing it. Many sleep masks today are designed with a contoured nose or without fabric around the nose to prevent any light from penetrating.

Some eye masks are built like swim goggles: They feature two convex gaps that allow you to fully open and close your eyes beneath the mask without letting any light in. Eye cups are especially beneficial for people with sensitive eyes and for people who wear eyelash extensions.

Too loose, and the mask will fall off throughout the night. Too tight, and it could uncomfortably press against your eyes or snag your hair while you're sleeping. Luckily, many sleep masks come with an adjustable strap so you can customize the fit.

When shopping for a sleep mask, examine the product to locate any clasps or adjustable closures. If you're a back sleeper, you might prefer this piece on the side of your head. Stomach sleepers may find a clasp at the back more comfortable. For those who change positions frequently, consider an unobtrusive adjustment and/or closure mechanism like slim Velcro, a magnetic closure, or a slide buckle.

When testing it out, lie in your preferred sleep position and move around a bit—if the mask feels restrictive or shifts when you do, you may need to adjust the tightness. Keep in mind that some mechanisms hold up better over time—velcro can wear down, while buckles and magnetic closures usually last longer.

The material affects the thickness and the opacity of the sleep mask against light. You should also be cognizant of the materials that make up these sleep aids since they'll be hugging your face all night long.

This fine material is all the rage in the beauty world as it has been clinically proven to be biocompatible with human skin, supporting hydration, improving skin elasticity, and increasing cellular regeneration (which reduces fine lines and wrinkles). It's also cooling on the skin, which can be refreshing for hot sleepers.

Cotton is the goldilocks of eye masks; it's comfortable, easy to wash, durable, and breathable. Be mindful that cotton absorbs moisture, so this material may be best avoided if you use an eye cream at night.

Satin is smooth and soft like silk but is made of synthetic fibers. Its gentle texture is great for sensitive skin and minimizes friction against hair and skin, helping prevent irritation.

“There are studies that show that polyester masks help improve sleep quality and that there is a feeling of coolness or relaxation,” DelRosso says. Polyester is also typically more budget-friendly and is resistant to stretching and wrinkling over time, ensuring durability and longevity in use. Some blends are also moisture-wicking, which help keep sweat and oils off your skin and hair.

Contemporary sleep masks do more than block light. They come loaded with features designed to take your sleep to the next level. If you want more than a standard mask, consider these upgrades.

Aromatherapy sleep masks combine the benefits of light-blocking with the use of essential oils for therapeutic effects. Certain essential oils, such as lavender and chamomile, are known for their relaxing and stress-relieving properties, while others, like spearmint and eucalyptus, can help with headaches. Sleep masks are sometimes filled with flaxseed and rice infused with these essential oils, creating a weighted effect as well as providing aromatherapeutic benefits.

You've heard the buzz around weighted blankets and their benefits; the same concept applies to sleep masks. As we mentioned above, gentle pressure around the eyes is a physiological means for relaxation and stress relief. Weighted eye masks can also help relax facial muscles and reduce discomfort in sinus cavities.

Some sleep masks are engineered to be cooled with refrigerable gel inserts, while others are made with breathable temperature-regulating fabric (like polyester) that releases heat. The chill can also soothe tension headaches and migraines.

Second to sight, sound plays a crucial role in a good night's sleep—so much so that today, some high-tech sleep masks even come with speakers built into the areas near the ears. Through them, users can block out or mask outside noise or listen to meditation, soft music, or white noise at a volume low enough to not disturb your partner.

Sleep masks are a simple way to help your sleep cycle, but there are a few circumstances where they're not ideal. “If someone has glaucoma, or has an eye infection, I would not trap air there,” Carroll says.

DelRosso adds that those with sleep apnea or other breathing disorders should consult with their doctor before using a sleep mask, as it may interfere with their condition or CPAP machine. If you have sensitive skin or allergies, avoid eye masks with rough fabrics, heavy fillings, or scent inserts, which can all trigger irritations or reactions.

No matter how clean you think your face is when you rest your head on your pillow at night, sleep masks can accumulate dirt, oils, dust, and more allergens that could potentially lead to breakouts or infections. Regular cleaning also helps extend the life of the mask, so be sure to wash it weekly if worn nightly, or a few times a week if you have sensitive skin or eyes.

Make sure your face is freshly cleansed to remove buildup that may have accumulated on your skin throughout the day before slipping on your mask.

Here's how to wash a sleep mask:

When you're not wearing it, store your sleep mask in a secure location such as inside your nightstand or a dresser drawer to keep dust and dander buildup at bay. Also, tempting as it is, try not to perch it on your head in the morning—hair oils, sweat, and hair products can transfer onto the mask that way.

Avoid leaving a sleep mask in direct sunlight or hot spots, such as a windowsill or car dashboard, since heat and UV exposure can wear down sleep mask materials like silk, elastic, foam, and gel. If you're taking it on the go, keep it in a small pouch or case to protect it from dirt and grime in your bag and to prevent straps from getting tangled or stretched.

A sleep mask can do a lot of the heavy lifting, but your surroundings matter too. Try these simple tweaks to cut down on extra light in your space:

This is one cool solution for a hot topic.

The general trend in 3D printing is for faster and larger machines that provide more build volume with an increase in output. But sometimes it's just as cool to see things printed on a microscale. The benefits of microscopic 3D print can be rather macro. Fabric8Labs revealed at Hot Chips that it has developed a cool new way to 3D print copper into super small structures that can be used for directly cooling processors, which is a huge practical impact to come out of such tiny technology.

Fabric8Labs is looking to use OLED display technology to 3D print complex copper cooling solutions with pixel-perfect accuracy onto chips https://t.co/nmVJ3kkYXKAugust 26, 2025

This process is accomplished using a method similar to resin printing but instead of relying on UV light, it integrates OLED display tech. This process is claimed to enable extreme precision, allowing for what Fabric8Labs describes as "pixel-perfect accuracy". With this technology, they've demonstrated a few 3D printable surfaces that can be applied to chips for cooling.

The way resin printing usually works, beams of light are targeted into a vat of resin, causing it to harden layer by layer. In this case, Fabric8Labs takes advantage of electrical charges instead of beams of light to deposit copper. This type of 3D printing is known as electromechanical additive manufacturing (or ECAM for short).

At the moment, it is able to 3D print custom cooling plates with a variety of intricate designs that the company claims are better optimized for cooling compared to standard straight channels. These designs range from custom configurations created by team members to those optimized using AI.

The straight channel design of regular cooling plates is more prone to clogging, but the ability to 3D print cooling plates enables creating offset channels that prevent this from happening. At the moment, the team is able to print these unique cooling plates for manual installation. However, the future could consist of 3D printing these cooling structures directly onto chips.

If you're new to 3D printing and want to dabble in it yourself, we don't blame you. It's an exciting hobby that's only growing more exciting as time goes on. Check out our list of best 3D printers to see which ones we recommend and get an idea of what to look out for when shopping.

Apple has officially set a date for its iPhone September event, which is due to take place on September 9. This year's launch will be held at the Steve Jobs Theater on Apple's campus in Cupertino, California. The company is expected to unveil the iPhone 17 range, which for the first time will include the iPhone 17 Air—though that name could change—Apple's thinnest and lightest iPhone to date. We're also expecting the Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch Ultra 3, and the AirPods Pro 3.

The invitations included the tagline “Awe dropping,” along with the Apple logo in shades of blue and green. These are rumored to be color choices for the iPhone 17 Pro devices. The logo also moves like a heat map on Apple's website, which could allude to potential thermal improvements in the upcoming devices, or the rumored switch back to aluminum instead of titanium on the iPhone Pro models (which would also improve thermals, anyway).

WIRED will be on the ground live-blogging the latest from Apple's presentation. In the meantime, you can brush up on all the features coming to your iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Watch, as Apple usually drops the next operating system version right after the event.

The Oura Ring.

Oura, the leading global manufacturer of smart rings, announced this week that it has plans to build a manufacturing facility in Fort Worth, Texas. Oura's largest enterprise customer is the Department of Defense, and US-based manufacturing operations will support its needs. Oura has sent tens of thousands of rings to optimize performance across all branches of the US armed services. It notes that its rings are being used in four key research areas: stress management and resilience, fitness optimization, fatigue risk management, and early illness detection.

All the top gear news of the week in one place. Here's more you may have missed this week:

This announcement comes at a time when the smart ring industry is going through lots of shake-ups. The US International Trade Commission recently ruled in favor of Oura in a patent infringement case against competitors Ultrahuman and Ringconn, which have had to pull their respective rings from the US market. This is particularly bad news for Ultrahuman, which has a facility in Plano, Texas, where the company was planning to manufacture rings in the US to get around tariffs. Ultrahuman is also countersuing. (It's all very messy.)

We'll keep an eye on the situation as it evolves, but for now, US customers might only be able to buy an Oura ring. It's a good thing it's our favorite smart ring. —Adrienne So

Plaud makes a credit card-sized AI note-taking device that listens to the world around you and then transcribes conversations, summarizing them into meeting notes with actionable insights. It began with the Plaud Note, then the Plaud NotePin, a wearable device, and this week the company unveiled the Plaud Note Pro ($179).

It shares a similar card-shaped design with the original, but now it features two extra microphones to pick up audio at a wider range. There's also now a 0.95-inch AMOLED screen that displays battery life, the current recording status, and the mode. Unlike the original, you don't need to flip a switch to swap from recording calls to in-person meetings—the Pro will do it for you. Just long-press the button once to start recording. You can highlight key information during a meeting with a short press, and you can type in the phone app simultaneously to add your thoughts; they'll be contextualized to the recording instantly. Plaud also lets you snap a photo with your phone to add additional context.

Plaud's Note Pro can identify and label individual speakers in its transcriptions, and it can transcribe 112 languages. You can also ask Plaud (via the app) a specific question from your notes, so there's no need to hunt for key details. It employs large language models from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. The Note Pro is up for preorder now and ships in October. You get 300 transcription minutes per month, but you'll have to cough up $100 per year to quadruple that and get access to new features faster. (There's a plan that offers unlimited transcription minutes for $240 annually.)

Level Home makes some of the sneakiest smart locks you'll find. The company's original lock stays hidden inside your existing lock, but its latest designs are full lock replacements that look like everyday locks instead of bulky smart ones. The new Level Lock Pro embraces that design ethos. It looks like a simple front door lock with a small face, and doesn't look large enough to have smart home features. But it does.

There's no keypad (though you can purchase one for $79) or biometric reader, but it does work with Apple's Home keys or NFC key fobs, along with a physical key. It can connect to devices via Bluetooth if your Wi-Fi goes down. It's also Matter compatible. The Pro has an even smaller design than its predecessor, the Level Lock, and Level says the Pro is faster and more efficient with a dual-core microprocessor built into the lock. It also has door status detection, so it can tell you whether the door is closed or ajar without any additional accessories.

The Level Lock Pro is available now for $349 and comes in either a black matte or silver finish. —Nena Farrell

Chipolo's been making Bluetooth trackers we like for a while, but you've always had to manually replace the battery. No more! Chipolo's new Card and Loop trackers are rechargeable, and the company claims six months of battery life on a single charge.

Both devices offer 400 feet of Bluetooth range. The larger card-sized tracker is designed for wallets, while the little Loop is a small circle you can add to a keyring, dog collar, or even sneak into your kid's backpack. While Chipolo has been our favorite for Android, it works with both Apple and Android's native device-tracking apps (Find My and Find Hub, respectively), and Chipolo has a companion app that the tracker will pair with for extra features.

The charging style varies for these two models, with the smaller Loop recharging via USB-C and the larger Card capable of using Qi wireless chargers. Chipolo doesn't include any chargers or cords, so choose the model you've already got the equipment for. The trackers are available for preorder, with the Card and Loop on sale for $39. They'll ship in October. —Nena Farrell

Google may have given up on tablets, but Samsung's churning on. Early this week, the company introduced its latest entry-level slate, the Galaxy Tab S10 Lite, padding the existing Tab S10 series. It has a 10.9-inch screen that can hit up to 600 nits of peak brightness, Samsung's Exynos 1380 processor (the same as in the Galaxy A26), and starts with 6 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage. There's a microSD card slot so you can expand space if you need it. As usual, the S Pen stylus comes included in the box. It starts at $349 and goes on sale September 4.

The Tab S10 Lite comes right as rumors are bubbling up about Samsung's next tablet generation, the Galaxy Tab S11 series, which purportedly includes the Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra. This week, Samsung announced a virtual Galaxy Event on September 4, kicking off the festivities at the IFA consumer tech show in Berlin. That's likely where we'll learn more about these flagship Android tablets, and likely the Galaxy S25 FE midrange smartphone.

Here's a weird one. Early in the week, I received an anonymous email from someone claiming that Nothing had used stock photography to pass as photos shot with the company's Phone (3), which launched early in July. This source provided a screen recording of an in-store demo unit that showed a handful of images, which Nothing claimed were shot on the Phone (3).

Most of these photos were on the Stills photo licensing platform, so I reached out to two of the photographers—Roman Fox and Henry Han—and both claimed Nothing purchased the photos under a standard digital use license. Fox says his photo was captured on a Fujifilm XH2s, and Han says he used a mirrorless camera. Clearly, none of the photos in these demo units were shot by a Nothing smartphone.

This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

Nothing cofounder Akis Evangelidis took to X to break down what happened, citing that initial live demo units need placeholder images four months before the launch of the phone. These are supposed to be replaced as the company enters mass production with actual photo samples with a new version of the live demo unit. “It was brought to our attention that some live demo units' stock imagery were not updated,” Evangelidis says. The company is working to rectify this so that all demo units reflect the latest version, with no stock photography.

It's a reasonable explanation, and I checked prior marketing materials and Nothing's own reviewer's guide and didn't find any of these stock photos present. Han points out that Nothing licensed the photos from April 28, 2025, through October 28, 2026, which doesn't quite line up with Evangelidis' timeline and also runs for longer than necessary. However, the transaction statement says “Arbok LDU" with “Stock Images” as the project description; Arbok is likely the codename for the Phone (3), and LDU stands for Live Demo Unit. All of which suggests that the company isn't lying. Maybe just use Phone (2) sample images as a placeholder next time.

This is the new social contract that has replaced the old social contract, which was dad works a completely ordinary job, mom stays at home, and you can afford a house, a couple of cars and as many children as you please. The new contract is perhaps more glamorous, but personally I'd rather stop renting.

Beta blockers-drugs commonly prescribed for a range of cardiac conditions, including heart attacks-provide no clinical benefit for patients who have had an uncomplicated myocardial infarction with preserved heart function. Beta blockers have been the standard treatment for these patients for 40 years.

This is a breakthrough discovery from the "REBOOT Trial" with senior investigator Valentin Fuster, MD, PhD, President of Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital and General Director of Spain's Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC). The study results, which could overturn a standard treatment paradigm, were presented on Saturday, August 30, during a "Hot Line" session at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Madrid, and simultaneously published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

Additionally, a REBOOT substudy, published Saturday, August 30, in the European Heart Journal, shows that women treated with beta blockers had a higher risk of death, heart attack, or hospitalization for heart failure compared to women not receiving the drug. Men did not have this increased risk.

This trial will reshape all international clinical guidelines. It joins other previous landmark trials led by CNIC and Mount Sinai-such as SECURE with the polypill and DapaTAVI, with SLT2 inhibition associated to TAVI-that have already transformed some global approaches to cardiovascular disease." 

Dr. Valentin Fuster, MD, PhD, President of Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital and General Director of Spain's Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares

The SECURE trial showed a polypill, a single pill that that combines three medications - which contains aspirin, ramipril, and atorvastatin – reduces cardiovascular events by 33 percent in patients treated with this after a heart attack. The DapaTAVI trial showed both dapagliflozin and the related medication empagliflozin - drugs used to treat diabetes- improves the prognosis of patients with aortic stenosis treated by transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

"REBOOT will change clinical practice worldwide," says Principal Investigator Borja Ibáñez, MD, CNIC's Scientific Director, who presented the results. "Currently, more than 80 percent of patients with uncomplicated myocardial infarction are discharged on beta blockers. The REBOOT findings represent one of the most significant advances in heart attack treatment in decades."

Although generally considered safe, beta blockers can cause side effects such as fatigue, bradycardia (low heart rate), and sexual dysfunction. For more than 40 years, beta blockers have been prescribed as a standard treatment after a heart attack, but their benefit in the context of modern treatments was unproven. The REBOOT trial, is the largest clinical trial on this subject. The international study was coordinated by CNIC in collaboration with the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research in Milan.

Researchers enrolled 8,505 patients across 109 hospitals in Spain and Italy. Participants were randomly assigned to receive or not receive beta blockers after hospital discharge. All patients otherwise received the current standard of care and were followed for a median of nearly four years. The results showed no significant differences between the two groups in rates of death, recurrent heart attack, or hospitalization for heart failure.

A REBOOT subgroup analysis found that women treated with beta blockers experienced more adverse events. Results show women treated with beta-blockers had a 2.7 percent higher absolute risk of mortality compared to those not treated with beta-blockers during the 3.7 years of follow-up of the study. The elevated risk when treated with beta-blockers was restricted to women with a complete normal cardiac function after a heart attack (left ventricular ejection fraction of 50 percent or higher). Those with a mild deterioration in cardiac function did not have an excess risk of adverse outcomes when treated with beta-blockers.

"After a heart attack, patients are typically prescribed multiple medications, which can make adherence difficult," explains Dr. Ibáñez. "Beta blockers were added to standard treatment early on because they significantly reduced mortality at the time. Their benefits were linked to reduced cardiac oxygen demand and arrhythmia prevention. But therapies have evolved. Today, occluded coronary arteries are reopened rapidly and systematically, drastically lowering the risk of serious complications such as arrhythmias. In this new context-where the extent of heart damage is smaller-the need for beta blockers is unclear. While we often test new drugs, it's much less common to rigorously question the continued need for older treatments."

That was the motivation behind REBOOT.

"The trial was designed to optimize heart attack care based on solid scientific evidence and without commercial interests. These results will help streamline treatment, reduce side effects, and improve quality of life for thousands of patients every year," Dr. Ibanez adds.

REBOOT was conducted without pharmaceutical industry funding.

Like bees breathing life into gardens, providing pollen and making flowers blossom, little cellular machines called mitochondria breathe life into our bodies, buzzing with energy as they produce the fuel that powers each of our cells. Maintaining mitochondrial metabolism requires input from many molecules and proteins-some of which have yet to be discovered.

Salk Institute researchers are taking a closer look at whether mitochondria rely on microproteins-small proteins that have been difficult to find and, consequently, underestimated for their role in health and disease. In their new study, a microprotein discovered just last year at Salk, called SLC35A4-MP, was found to play a critical role in upholding mitochondrial structure and regulating metabolic stress in mouse fat cells. The findings plant the seed for future microprotein-based treatments for obesity, aging, and other mitochondrial disorders.

The study, published in Science Advances on August 29, 2025, is part of a series of recent discoveries at Salk that showcase the functional importance of microproteins in cellular biology, metabolism, and stress.

Microproteins have long been dismissed as random genetic junk, but our work adds to a growing body of research demonstrating that many of them are actually crucial regulators of cell physiology. Here we reveal that a microprotein is responsible for preserving mitochondrial structure and function in brown fat tissue, which regulates body temperature and energy balance."

Alan Saghatelian, senior author, professor and Dr. Frederik Paulsen Chair at Salk

In the late spring of 2024, Saghatelian's lab discovered the genetic code for SLC35A4-MP hidden in an upstream open reading frame on a strand of messenger RNA (mRNA). The longstanding belief was that each mRNA strand codes for a single protein-a one-to-one ratio of mRNA-to-protein, always. So, when scientists found additional sections of genetic material- upstream open reading frames-on mRNA strands, they thought they must be either 1) random noncoding junk or 2) regulatory code that influences the translation of that mRNA.

But as genetic probing and sequencing technology became more sophisticated, researchers soon realized some of those upstream open reading frames coded for functional microproteins. This discovery brought an entirely new dimension to cellular life, as microproteins long hidden in disregarded upstream open reading frames are now in full bloom-ready to be plucked and studied.

Some of the first functional microproteins to be described were involved in metabolism and mitochondrial regulation. This includes Saghatelian's 2024 study, in which the lab first discovered SLC35A4-MP in the walls of mitochondria. Further tests suggested the microprotein might be helping maintain healthy cellular metabolism.

But these findings were based on data collected from biochemical assays in test tubes and cells cultured in petri dishes. To fully confirm and describe SLC35A4-MP's physiological role, they would have to test its function in a living system.

"SLC35A4-MP is among the first microproteins to be functionally characterized in mice," says first author Andréa Rocha, a postdoctoral researcher in Saghatelian's lab. "Indeed, we found that SLC35A4-MP regulates mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism in mice, which really goes to show that microproteins cannot be overlooked as we search for biological factors that regulate health."

To classify SLC35A4-MP, the researchers looked at an exemplary metabolic tissue that works its mitochondria especially hard: brown fat. Brown fat cells are metabolically demanding, as they regulate energy balance and body temperature. The researchers removed SLC35A4-MP entirely from mouse brown fat cells, then induced metabolically stressful events like cold exposure or a high-fat diet.

Without SLC35A4-MP, mice were unable to dial up their metabolism during cold exposure. Their mitochondria were structurally compromised, enlarged, dysfunctional, and inflamed. Outside of the mitochondria, other parts of the brown fat cells were also affected. The researchers saw signs of cell interior remodeling and further inflammation-trademarks of metabolic decline in obesity-related conditions.

The findings demonstrate the fundamental role SLC35A4-MP plays in regulating brown fat cell function and response to metabolic stress. And because mitochondria, our buzzing cellular bees, are in every cell type in the body, the findings extend everywhere, too. SLC35A4-MP could be a powerful therapeutic target for any disease or disorder that impacts metabolic and mitochondrial function, from obesity to aging and beyond.

Microprotein research is finally springing to life, and the team sees bright blooms ahead in the search for more functional microproteins.

"As scientists have been able to add more microproteins to our protein databases, the question has remained, do these microproteins have any physiological relevance?" says Saghatelian. "And our study says yes, they are important physiological regulators. I hope that adds more fuel to the study of microproteins moving forward."

Some might say it looks like a finger. Others might see a worm. Scientists in the field often liken it to an antenna. The technical name is primary cilium. This slender, microscopic appendage juts out from the surface of most cells in the human body - and yet for many years, it was completely missing from textbook illustrations.

Scientists began paying more attention to primary cilia around 2003. That's when a scientist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK), the late Kathryn Anderson, PhD, discovered that primary cilia play a hugely important role in embryo development: They process signals from a family of proteins called Hedgehog that cue the patterning of the early embryo, including the formation of the neural tube.

Since then, this antenna-like organelle has become a hot topic for research, in part because defects in primary cilia can lead to a whole host of medical problems - everything from hearing loss and cleft palate to having one's internal organs located on the wrong side of the body. But a major unanswered question is which molecular cues tell cells to make a primary cilium in the first place.

In a new paper published this week in Science, MSK developmental biologists Yinwen Liang, PhD, and Alexandra Joyner, PhD, report that they have solved part of the mystery: Two transcription factors, SP5 and SP8, act as a kind of on-off switch for the initiation of cilium formation. In cells without a primary cilium, turning these genes on can cause them to build one.

The results have immediate and long-term implications for the understanding and treatment of diseases caused by missing or malfunctioning primary cilia - called ciliopathies - which affect 1 in 2,000 people worldwide.

When Dr. Liang, a senior scientist in the Joyner Lab and formerly a postdoc fellow in Kathryn Anderson's lab, first started thinking about why some cell types have primary cilia and others don't, she suspected it was a case of preferential disassembly - that is, cells lacking primary cilia actively promote the disassembly of the structure. In cells that make a primary cilium, perhaps that disassembly process is turned off, so the proteins can build up and form one.

But experiments designed to target and block such disassembly had little effect on the presence or absence of primary cilia. That led Dr. Liang to team up with Dr. Joyner, whose lab in the Sloan Kettering Institute has excellent tools for studying how genes regulate developmental processes. If disassembly isn't the key, they thought, then maybe the transcription factors that turn specific genes on or off is what determines whether a cell builds a primary cilium.

To get at that question, Drs. Liang and Joyner first used a method called single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to identify which of the genes involved in cilia formation and function are turned on in cell types with and without primary cilia. The scientists took advantage of the fact that most cells in the mouse embryo have primary cilia while cells from the mouse extraembryonic yolk sac do not. Using scRNAseq, they identified more than 100 such genes that are more highly expressed in ciliated cells.

Next, they wondered whether any of those genes were so-called transcription factors - proteins whose main function is turning on other genes. To answer that question, they turned to a technique called Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq), which reveals where the genome is "open" and can be "read" or transcribed.

Using that method, the scientists were able to home in on two genes that had telltale signs of being transcription factors. Further analysis revealed that these two genes, Sp5 and Sp8, were very active in cell types with a primary cilium, but inactive in cells lacking one.

The most pleasing results came when they either knocked out these genes in cells with cilia or introduced them into cells lacking cilia. Those results showed that Sp5 and Sp8 were required for primary cilium formation in the early mouse embryo. Moreover, simply overexpressing one gene, Sp8, was enough to initiate primary cilium formation in cells without them.

If you add SP8 to extraembryonic cells, many of the cells now make cilia. No one's ever seen that result before."

Dr. Alexandra Joyner, PhD, MSK developmental biologist

Drs. Liang and Joyner reasoned that these two proteins, SP5 and SP8, sit at the top of the cell's decision tree for making primary cilia. "We see it as a big breakthrough to find the upstream transcription factors that switch the whole thing on," Dr. Liang adds.

Dr. Liang will be leaving MSK shortly to begin her own lab in China, where she hopes to continue working on translating these basic discoveries into clinical breakthroughs for people with ciliopathies.

"My long-term goal is to improve our understanding of how cilia are formed and then use that information to benefit the clinical study of ciliopathies," she says.

Dr. Joyner retired from MSK earlier this year and is now an emeritus member of the MSK faculty. Read more about her long and distinguished career.

New technique to image single lipids: Lipids are notoriously difficult to detect with light microscopy. Using a new chemical labeling strategy, the Dresden team has overcome this limitation, enabling novel insights into where specific lipids are located and how they are transported in cells.

Map of lipid flow: The researchers used the new lipid imaging method to answer the long-standing question how cells transport specific lipids to their target organelle membranes. The study revealed that non-vesicular lipid transport by proteins is the primary mechanism that maintains the membrane composition of specific organelles.

Understanding the role of lipids in diseases: Lipid imbalances play a role in several metabolic or neurodegenerative diseases. The new lipid-imaging technique will help understand the role of lipid transport in health and disease. The identification of the proteins involved in selective lipid transport can accelerate further discoveries of new drug targets for lipid-associated diseases.

Lipid molecules, or fats, are crucial to all forms of life. Cells need lipids to build membranes, separate and organize biochemical reactions, store energy, and transmit information. Every cell can create thousands of different lipids, and when they are out of balance, metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases can arise. It is still not well understood how cells sort different types of lipids between cell organelles to maintain the composition of each membrane. A major reason is that lipids are difficult to study, since microscopy techniques to precisely trace their location inside cells have so far been missing.

In a long-standing collaboration André Nadler, a chemical biologist at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics (MPI-CBG) in Dresden, Germany teamed up with Alf Honigmann, a bioimaging specialist at Biotechnology Center (BIOTEC) at the TUD Dresden University of Technology, to develop a method that enables visualizing lipids in cells using standard fluorescence microscopy. After the first successful proof of concept, the duo brought mass-spectrometry expert Andrej Shevchenko (MPI-CBG), Björn Drobot at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR), and the group of Martin Hof from the J. Heyrovsky Institute of Physical Chemistry in Prague on board to study how lipids are transported between cellular organelles.

"We started our project with synthesizing a set of minimally modified lipids that represent the main lipids present in organelle membranes. These modified lipids are essentially the same as their native counterparts, with just a few different atoms that allowed us to track them under the microscope," explains Kristin Böhlig, a PhD student in the Nadler group and chemist who was in charge of creating the modified lipids.

The modified lipids mimic natural lipids and are "bifunctional," which means they can be activated by UV light, causing the lipid to bind or crosslink with nearby proteins. The modified lipids were loaded in the membrane of living cells and, over time, transported into the membranes of organelles. The researchers worked with human cells in cell culture, such as bone or intestinal cells, as they are ideal for imaging.

After the treatment with UV light, we were able to monitor the lipids with fluorescence microscopy and capture their location over time. This gave us a comprehensive picture of lipid exchange between cell membrane and organelle membranes."

Kristin Böhlig, PhD student

In order to understand the microscopy data, the team needed a custom image analysis pipeline. "To address our specific needs, I developed an image analysis pipeline with automated image segmentation assisted by artificial intelligence to quantify the lipid flow through the cellular organelle system," says Juan Iglesias-Artola, who did the image analysis.

By combining the image analysis with mathematical modeling, done by Björn Drobot at the HZDR, the research team discovered that between 85% and 95% of the lipid transport between the membranes of cell organelles is organized by carrier proteins that move the lipids, rather than by vesicles. This non-vesicular transport is much more specific with regard to individual lipid species and their sorting to the different organelles in the cell. The researchers also found that the lipid transport by proteins is ten times faster than by vesicles. These results imply that the lipid compositions of organelle membranes are primarily maintained through fast, species-specific, non-vesicular lipid transport.

In a parallel set of experiments, the group of Andrej Shevchenko at the MPI-CBG used ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry to see how the different lipids change their structure during the transport from the cell membrane to the organelle membrane.

This new approach provides the first-ever quantitative map of how lipids move through the cell to different organelles. The results suggest that non-vesicular lipid transport has a key role in the maintenance of each organelle membrane composition.

Alf Honigmann, research group leader at the BIOTEC says, "Our lipid-imaging technique enables the mechanistic analysis of lipid transport and function directly in cells, which has been impossible before. We think that our work opens the door to a new era of studying the role of lipids within the cell."

Imaging of lipids will allow further discoveries and help to reveal the underlying mechanisms in diseases caused by lipid imbalances. The new technique could potentially help to develop new druggable targets and therapeutic approaches for lipid-associated diseases, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

André Nadler, research group leader at MPI-CBG, looks back at the start of the study, "Imaging lipids in cells has always been one of the most challenging aspects of microscopy. Our project was no different. Alf Honigmann and I started discussing about solving the lipid imaging problem as soon as we got hired in close succession at MPI-CBG in 2014/15 and we quickly decided to go for it. It still took us almost five years from the start of the project to the point in autumn 2019 when the two of us finally produced a sample with a beautiful plasma membrane stain. That's when we knew that we were onto something big. As a reward, certain well known global events meant we were required to shut down our laboratories a few months later. In the end, the delay was for the best. Before the revolution in the use of artificial intelligence in image segmentation, we would not have been able to properly quantify the imaging data, so our conclusions would have been much more limited."

Researchers still need to determine which lipid-transfer proteins drive the selective transport of different lipid species. They also need to identify the energy sources that power lipid transport and ensure that each organelle keeps its own unique membrane composition.

Previously, research on controlling gene networks has been carried out based on a single stimulus-response of cells. More recently, studies have been proposed to precisely analyze complex gene networks to identify control targets. A KAIST research team has succeeded in developing a universal technology that identifies gene control targets in altered cellular gene networks and restores them. This achievement is expected to be widely applied to new anticancer therapies such as cancer reversibility, drug development, precision medicine, and reprogramming for cell therapy.

KAIST (President Kwang Hyung Lee) announced on the 28th of August that Professor Kwang-Hyun Cho's research team from the Department of Bio and Brain Engineering has developed a technology to systematically identify gene control targets that can restore the altered stimulus-response patterns of cells to normal by using an algebraic approach. The algebraic approach expresses gene networks as mathematical equations and identifies control targets through algebraic computations.

The research team represented the complex interactions among genes within a cell as a "logic circuit diagram" (Boolean network). Based on this, they visualized how a cell responds to external stimuli as a "landscape map" (phenotype landscape).

By applying a mathematical method called the "semi-tensor product," they developed a way to quickly and accurately calculate how the overall cellular response would change if a specific gene were controlled.

However, because the key genes that determine actual cellular responses number in the thousands, the calculations are extremely complex. To address this, the research team applied a numerical approximation method (Taylor approximation) to simplify the calculations. In simple terms, they transformed a complex problem into a simpler formula while still yielding nearly identical results.

Through this, the team was able to calculate which stable state (attractor) a cell would reach and predict how the cell's state would change when a particular gene was controlled. As a result, they were able to identify core gene control targets that could restore abnormal cellular responses to states most similar to normal.

Professor Cho's team applied the developed control technology to various gene networks and verified that it can accurately predict gene control targets that restore altered stimulus-response patterns of cells back to normal.

In particular, by applying it to bladder cancer cell networks, they identified gene control targets capable of restoring altered responses to normal. They also discovered gene control targets in large-scale distorted gene networks during immune cell differentiation that are capable of restoring normal stimulus-response patterns. This enabled them to solve problems that previously required only approximate searches through lengthy computer simulations in a fast and systematic way.

This study is evaluated as a core original technology for the development of the Digital Cell Twin model, which analyzes and controls the phenotype landscape of gene networks that determine cell fate. In the future, it is expected to be widely applicable across the life sciences and medicine, including new anticancer therapies through cancer reversibility, drug development, precision medicine, and reprogramming for cell therapy."

Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a rare genetic disorder with symptoms, including facial anomalies (such as fused eyebrows, short nose, upturned nose tip, and downturned mouth corners), growth retardation, small head (microcephaly), developmental delays, cognitive impairments, excess hair growth, and limb anomalies. Currently, mutations in seven genes (NIBPL, SMC1A, SMC3, RAD21, BRD4, HDAC8, and ANKRD11) are known to be associated with CdLS. CdLS is diagnosed based on both genetic testing and clinical examination. However, the clinical and genetic characteristics of CdLS in the Chinese population have not been determined.

To address this research gap, a team led by Professor Chunxiu Gong from the National Center for Health, Beijing, China, examined Chinese pediatric patients with CdLS to determine the clinical presentation of the disease and the genetic alterations. The study was published online in Pediatric Investigation on 02 July 2025. Prof. Gong states that "Estimating the prevalence of CdLS has been challenging due to underdiagnosis or lack of recognition of milder phenotypes. Thus, elucidating the clinical and genetic characteristics of CdLS in the Chinese population will guide pediatricians to better diagnose and manage the disease in China."

After recording the clinical presentation of patients and the disease severity, the researchers extracted DNA from the blood of 19 children with CdLS and performed whole-exome sequencing, a technique for determining the sequence of protein-coding regions (exomes).

Based on a standard scoring system, 12 patients presented with classic CdLS. Global developmental delays were observed in 16 children, while prenatal growth retardation and short stature were observed in 14 children. The most frequent clinical presentations were craniofacial anomalies, especially a short nose and upturned nose tip, and small hands and/or feet. Skin aberrations and hearing loss were less common.

Whole-exome sequencing revealed 19 mutations in three genes. Most of these mutations (15 mutations) were detected in the gene NIPBL, which encodes a development-related protein delangin. Specifically, NIPBL harbored mutations that result in amino acid substitution (missense mutation), protein truncation (nonsense mutation), protein sequence alteration (frameshift mutation), and altered mRNA processing (splicing variant). Two new variants (one missense mutation and one splicing variant) were detected in SMC1A (a chromosome structure-regulating gene). Similarly, two new variants (one frameshift mutation and one deletion) were detected in RAD21 (a cell division-related gene).

The study also examined whether genetic changes are correlated with clinical presentation. The major correlation was detected with NIPBL null variants, which are a type of mutation that results in the complete loss of gene function. Patients with NIPBL null variants (nonsense, frameshift, and large deletion mutations) exhibited impaired growth and microcephaly.

To examine the potential therapeutic strategies for CdLS, the study focused on three patients whose parents requested recombinant human growth hormone (rh-GH) therapy. One female patient diagnosed with CdLS at the age of 3 years underwent rh-GH therapy at the age of 5 years. Although the patient's height increased by 8 cm, the treatment was discontinued as the parents deemed the response to be inadequate. One male patient diagnosed with CdLS at the age of 10 years continues to undergo rh-GH therapy and has increased his height by 12 cm. Another female patient aged 11 years underwent rh-GH therapy at the age of 7 years. Although the patient's height increased by 10 cm within 1 year, the treatment was discontinued owing to hand and foot enlargement. The lead author, Xiaoqiao Li, remarks that "While rh-GH therapy was effective in two cases, it was associated with undesirable outcomes in one patient. Hence, individualized treatment plan and dosage monitoring are critical to enhance treatment effectiveness and minimize adverse effects."

By identifying the characteristics of CdLS, this study provided directions for clinicians to diagnose CdLS and develop management strategies specifically for Chinese patients. These findings also provide a foundation for epidemiological studies on CdLS in China in the future.

Physical interactions between proteins influence anything from cell signaling and growth to immune responses, so the ability to control these interactions is of great interest to biologists. Researchers have used neural networks to help develop new proteins called binders that are designed to attach to therapeutically relevant targets, in the same way our immune systems use antibodies to bind to pathogens. But these systems, which use deep learning to predict protein shapes from sequences of amino acid building blocks, require computer science expertise.

"Traditional binder discovery methods involve screening tens of thousands of protein candidates, which requires experimental capabilities and computational expertise that not every lab can afford or has," says Lennart Nickel, a PhD student in the Laboratory of Protein Design and Immunoengineering (LPDI), led by Bruno Correia, in EPFL's School of Engineering. "BindCraft grew out of a desire to develop a more accessible, user-friendly tool that would only need to test a handful of proteins to get a binder."

Instead of feeding amino acid sequences into a neural network and painstakingly screening the resulting binders for a good fit, the EPFL team, in collaboration with scientists at MIT, used structures fed into Google DeepMind's AlphaFold2 system to generate sequences for new binders based on a set of desired functional properties – like binding to a specific target.

With BindCraft, we essentially reverse-engineer the current pipeline by using the protein structure prediction network right from the start to generate novel binders that have the properties we're looking for."

Christian Schellhaas, PhD student 

By focusing on a small number of binder designs, rather than high-throughput screening of vast libraries of candidates, BindCraft makes protein design more efficient as well as more democratized. The team has recently published their results in Nature, in collaboration with researchers across Switzerland, in the US, and in the Netherlands.

For their study, the team validated binders designed to interact with a dozen biotechnological and therapeutic molecules, including AAVs (adeno-associated viruses), which are used to deliver therapeutic genes into target cells; the CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease, which is used in gene editing applications; and certain common allergens. Overall, experiments showed that the team's binders attached to their intended targets with an average success rate of 46%, offering the possibility of greater therapeutic control.

"For AAVs, the idea is to use these new binders to enable gene delivery only to specific cells and tissues while minimizing the risk of potential side effects. In the case of CRISPR-Cas9, our binders can stop its gene editing activity and keep it from acting when and where it shouldn't," explains first author and LPDI scientist Martin Pacesa.

Since the initial publication of BindCraft as a preprint last fall, the platform has already seen swift and enthusiastic uptake by the biology community, sparking requests from users for modifications and additional functionalities.

"We were surprised by how quickly our tool has been adopted – it is even already being used in industry. The requests from users are a great inspiration to continue developing our method. We are already working on adapting BindCraft for smaller therapeutically relevant molecules like peptides," Pacesa says.

Manchester United recorded a bizarre own goal stat that sent them into the Premier League history books after a win over Burnley. The Red Devils finally picked up their maiden victory of the 2025-26 campaign after a five-goal thriller against newly promoted Burnley. Bryan Mbeumo and captain Bruno Fernandes were on target for United, while Josh Cullen's own goal gave them the lead in the first half.

Enzo Maresca and his men earned bragging rights in a 2-0 win against Fulham on derby day. But Chelsea would not have wanted to lose a summer signing to injury on the way. Indeed, as time passes, the manager believes that "it is not random" to see the absences stacking up at the start of the season.

The big blow for the Blues was an injury to Liam Delap. The striker pulled up with discomfort in his hamstring, forcing him off the field inside the first fifteen minutes of the match. It does not look good.

“Liam's injury doesn't look good in terms of he was full speed hamstring so that require always weeks and then in terms of another striker to be honest we just finished the game so now after when we finish we we're going to sit and we see if we take any decision.”

Tyrique George got minutes as a central forward while Joao Pedro played as a second striker. The Cobham graduate gives an option that the manager must think about retaining in the circumstances.

“The last game he played was against Manchester United at home last year and again we try to use a different solution. If you remember last year we used Pedro in some games as a nine. It is because we are always looking for solution but for sure when you have two proper nines, I think this is enough.”

The revolving door in West London left Nicolas Jackson on the verge of joining Bayern Munich on a loan deal. It is not clear whether or not the Blues will try to bring him back to make up the numbers.

“Just finished the game. Come here. No idea. We're going to see it now and we see it serious honest. I don't have any idea. When you have two strikers, it's enough. When one of them is injury for many weeks probably is not enough. Today we play more than one hour with Tyrique and he did brilliant. “

With Levi Colwill suffering a long-term ACL injury and Cole Palmer pulling out of the warm-up before their win over West Ham last week, the effects of the Club World Cup are being felt.

“Unfortunately I don't have any answer because it's the first time you have a competition during the summer so I don't know. I think it's not random that Levi, Cole, Liam today. It is what it is.”

Maresca has handed minutes to several defenders to fill in for Colwill. One is a teenager who adds to the list of first team squad members from Cobham, and he has potential to refine in the men's game.

“Josh Acheampong was very good against Crystal Palace. He needs to make mistake to improve against Palace. The goal that we concede from free kick the one that the referees allow, Josh that lost the ball but it's part of the process if we want to build him and improve him. We're happy with Josh.”

Four other men, two of whom are back from injury, can contribute to the depth chart in the position.

“Tosin Adarabioyo is doing fantastic from last season, Trevoh Chalobah is exactly the same ever since he came back in January and we have Wesley Fofana back that is another one that can help us after the international break probably we can have also Benoit Badiashile.” 

Chelsea have not been convincing in the last fortnight. They drew 0-0 with Crystal Palace in front of their fans, getting lucky with a disallowed free kick for Eberechi Eze, and thrashed a hapless West Ham 5-1. Neither did they dominate in this duel, but they are unbeaten and went top of the table.

“I'm very happy first of all as you said because three games, seven points. It's important.”

The manager offered his opinion on who could be in contention for the league title with the Blues.

“I think the one that win the Premier League the year before they are always the one that u they are the favourite and then again Arsenal is there, Man City is there, Tottenham will be also there and you have always some team that they can be a surprise like last year for example Nottingham Forest.”

After the international break, Chelsea must raise the level of their performance to stay in the mix.

The Cottagers drew 1-1 in their first two fixtures and avoided defeat at home to Man United for the first time in 15 years last week. They built upon the momentum in the first half during this display, netting a disallowed goal for Joshua King that whipped up the anger of the Italian before the break.

Thankfully, the second half had much more of what the manager wanted to see from his squad.

“I'm very happy in general today. I was not happy after the first half. We didn't play the way we prepared and we were not good enough in second balls and duels. Second half I think we were very good on the ball and we were very good in second ball and duels and I think we deserve to win the game. We dominate second half and against this team if you are not strong enough you struggle.”

Enzo Fernandez appeared to be frustrated as he walked in at half time. But the captain claimed a goal from the penalty spot and an assist through a corner kick for Joao Pedro, putting his rage behind him.

“Enzo is Club World Cup winner, World Cup winner. And I think probably he's the only player in the world to win both title. When he's not good enough he can recognize and probably was upset for that because first half I think he was not good enough then second half he was like the rest brilliant.”

The penalty also came through a VAR review as Ryan Sessegnon handled the ball in his box. Both calls were harsh for the guests, who should have gotten more, but Maresca did not share sympathies.

“I review both actions. From my point of view, it's quite clear that the first one, one of their players kick our players and the second one is quite clear that it's handball. Now I can understand that from their point of view can be no foul but I think it's quite clear that it's foul and then it's penalty.”

Gonzalo Garcia's rise to prominence in the FIFA Club World Cup was not one many saw coming, particularly because he was not the team's preferred No. 9 profile at the time.

Endrick, who was the team's big bet as a summer signing last season, was largely dubbed to be the team's long-term No. 9 fix. His injury at the time, however, opened the door for Garcia to see prominence.

Now, Xabi Alonso has two players competing for the same position and thus faces a good problem in his selection. Endrick, however, is the one with more to prove as he nears a recovery from his injury.

The teenage sensation missed the end of last season's La Liga campaign and then the beginning of the FIFA Club World Cup after suffering a hamstring injury but was expected to be back for the latter half of the USA-based tournament.

Unfortunately, however, he suffered a relapse just before his return to action and was ruled out until mid-September in which came as a massive blow to him.

Now, as relayed by MARCA, Endrick is in the final stages of his recovery and has begun working on the grass and is even moving around without discomfort.

The player is determined to fight for a place under Xabi Alonso and refuses to falter after the rise of Garcia. 

The 19-year-old striker is, in fact, the first player to arrive for training in the morning and wishes not just to come back fast but to return better than ever before.

It is the young phenom's plan to first earn a place in Alonso's rotation, stake claim on a place in the starting XI and eventually be important for the club, and he is working towards his goals in silence and with discipline.

Endrick received multiple offers in the summer, even to leave on loan and see regular minutes to further his development. However, he never considered a departure in any capacity as it was his single objective to stay and fight at the club.

As things stand, the plan is for Endrick to return soon after the international break next month.

Real Madrid are looking to earn nine points out of nine as they play hosts to RCD Mallorca later this evening.

Once the match is over, Xabi Alonso will receive a much-needed breather owing to the upcoming international break.

During this period, the Real Madrid coach is likely to sit back and think about the combinations that have worked so far so that he can better prepare for the season ahead.

As of now, Alonso is facing two key selection dilemmas, as far as the Real Madrid starting eleven is concerned and both of them lie in defence, reports AS.

Earlier this summer, Real Madrid roped in Trent Alexander-Arnold on a free transfer with the hope that the Liverpool superstar will add competitive edge to the squad and eventually become a long-term replacement for Dani Carvajal.

While it was always expected that Carvajal will give stern competition to Trent, it is perhaps a bit concerning that the Englishman is already fall in comparison to the veteran's performances.

Indeed, Carvajal is already back in top form after returning from an injury and has become a theoretical starter in the team.

However, the Spaniard is not getting younger and given Trent's predicament, Alonso must soon choose a definitive favourite at right-back.

Another key area where Alonso is facing a selection dilemma is central defence, where new signing Dean Huijsen has become a first-team regular.

But who starts alongside the young Spaniard has become the great question, with Eder Militao and Antonio Rudiger fighting for a place in the team.

Militao is the favourite as the Brazilian participated in pre-season. However, Rudiger performed well against Oviedo and is giving stern competition.

Keeping Militao's fitness record in time, Xabi Alonso must find a careful balance between the two players while also keeping in mind that Rudiger's stay at the club may not extend beyond the end of the season.

Since signing on to become the head coach of the United States men's national team last September, Mauricio Pochettino has had to get up to speed on American sports culture — on Saturday, he got a crash course.

Pochettino, a native of Argentina, made his "Big Noon Kickoff" debut on Saturday morning ahead of Ohio State-Texas, which is as big as a rivalry can get in college football, and arguably all of American sports. "I'm so excited to be here," Pochettino said.

Pochettino is hopeful that the environment of a fierce college football rivalry can be replicated when the U.S. men's national team plays their first match of the 2026 FIFA World Cup on home soil 286 days from now.

"The most important thing is to arrive in very good condition and be competitive, and that these guys feel proud about the team like they are today," Pochettino said of next year's 48-team tournament.

"It's very exciting. It's going to be an unbelievable event, and it's going to be key to the future of soccer in the USA. The only thing we want is for the fans to enjoy our game like they're enjoying today."

Before leaving the set to watch the game alongside the passionate Ohio State fans in Columbus, Pochettino started an "OH-IO" chant to rile the crowd up.

For his sake, let's hope that Longhorn fans don't take that as him choosing a side in this rivalry.

Rodrygo will stay back at Real Madrid after winning manager Xabi Alonso's trust. The Brazilian winger was linked with a move to the Premier League throughout the summer, with Manchester City and Liverpool keen on signing him, however, after featuring in Madrid's starting lineup last week, he is satisfied with his role and has decided against exiting Santiago Bernabeu.

Chelsea's summer signings were the bright sparks but Enzo Maresca's team were on the receiving end of some very favourable calls against Fulham

Joao Pedro led a fortuitous Chelsea side to a hotly contested 2-0 win over Fulham in a match overshadowed by refereeing decisions.

The Blues were given a huge reprieve when Joshua King's 21st-minute goal was chalked off by referee Robert Jones following a VAR review as it was adjudged that Rodrigo Muniz fouled Trevoh Chalobah in the build-up. Then, in a huge sucker punch, Pedro scored his fifth Chelsea goal when he headed in Enzo Fernandez's pinpoint corner in first-half stoppage time. 

The visitors were left fuming again when Fernandez converted a 55th-minute penalty after Ryan Sessegnon handled in the box, although it looked like the ball struck Pedro's hand seconds before that. Chelsea, who improved as the match wore on, continued their unbeaten start to the season as Fulham's travelling support sang, "2-0 to the referee".

The Reds were upset by the Spaniard's dramatic change of heart last summer, but things have since worked out pretty well for them...

Less than a year ago, Arne Slot argued that there was no longer any point in talking about Martin Zubimendi's decision to turn down Liverpool. "We've moved on," the Dutchman insisted in an interview with The Times.

It would certainly be hard to question the veracity of that particular claim. The Reds romped to a record-equalling 20th English title thanks in no small part to Ryan Gravenberch, Slot's surprising solution to Liverpool's defensive midfield problem.

However, one can be sure that Zubimendi's name will come up before, during and after Sunday's eagerly-awaited Premier League showdown with Arsenal, the team that the Spain international chose to join less than a year after his 11th-hour U-turn left Liverpool in a state of shock...

Football is a sport of drama, skill, and moments that live forever. Among them, nothing excites fans more than an immediate strike right after kick-off. Over the decades, the FIFA World Cup has witnessed some of the Fastest Goals in World Cup History, stunning crowds and shaping matches within the very first minute. These lightning-fast goals stand as unforgettable examples of how quickly fortunes can change in football. This article highlights the Top 10 Fastest Goals in World Cup History under 60 seconds. 

 

Florian Albert scored one of the Fastest Goals in World Cup History when he netted just 50 seconds into Hungary's clash with Bulgaria at the 1962 FIFA World Cup. Known as one of Hungary's most talented strikers, Albert's instinctive positioning allowed him to find space inside the box almost immediately after kick-off. The Hungarian team launched a quick attack, and Albert was there to finish decisively, putting his side ahead before the Bulgarian defense could even settle. This early strike not only set the tone of the game but also highlighted Albert's clinical nature, which later earned him the Ballon d'Or in 1967.

 

His quick strike remains a shining memory of Hungary's World Cup history, especially during an era when they were recognized for producing technically gifted footballers. Scoring under one minute required sharp awareness, and Albert displayed both composure and killer instinct. Even though Hungary didn't go all the way in the tournament, this moment still stands among the fastest goals in World Cup history, preserved in FIFA records as a standout highlight.

 

Adalbert Desu entered football history books at the inaugural 1930 World Cup in Uruguay. In Romania's opening match against Peru, Desu scored just 50 seconds after the first whistle. This strike made him one of the first players to achieve one of the Fastest Goals in World Cup History. At a time when global football was still finding its rhythm, this goal demonstrated how individual brilliance could shape early tournaments. Romania surprised many by fielding a team with strong attacking instincts, and Desu's lightning-quick goal was a symbol of their fearless style of play.

 

The significance of Desu's strike extends beyond the match itself. It became one of the earliest examples of World Cup drama, proving that goals could come at any moment. Despite Romania's eventual exit from the tournament, Desu's place in the record books has never faded. His quick reaction to capitalize on Peru's defensive lapse highlighted the unpredictable nature of football, where preparation can be undone in seconds. This iconic moment is now remembered among the fastest goals in World Cup history, serving as a reminder that even nearly a century later, football's timeless magic often comes in the form of quickfire strikes that catch both defenders and fans completely off guard.

 

In 1938, Sweden produced one of their most memorable World Cup performances, thanks to Arne Nyberg's early strike against Cuba. Scoring within 35 seconds, Nyberg's goal still stands among the Fastest Goals in World Cup History. The Swedish forward demonstrated quick reflexes and anticipation as his team pressed Cuba straight from kick-off. The attack caught the Cuban defense unprepared, and Nyberg wasted no time in smashing the ball into the net.

 

Nyberg's quick strike was not only crucial in the context of that match but also showcased Sweden's tactical discipline in pressing high and attacking early. The World Cup in 1938 was played under challenging circumstances due to global tensions, yet moments like Nyberg's goal provided thrilling entertainment. Fans remember this match as a demonstration of Swedish efficiency, and Nyberg's name has been immortalized for his ability to deliver under pressure. His lightning goal still resonates with football historians and is often highlighted among the fastest goals in World Cup history, proving that early aggression can set the tone in knockout tournaments.

 

The same World Cup in 1938 produced another record-breaking strike, this time from French forward Emile Veinante. In France's clash with Belgium, Veinante opened the scoring within 35 seconds, securing his place in the list of Fastest Goals in World Cup History. Playing on home soil, Veinante's goal electrified the French crowd and gave the hosts a dream start. His ability to find space immediately after kick-off showed both his sharp instincts and the tactical intent of France to dominate their rivals quickly.

 

For the French national team, this goal represented the perfect blend of strategy and execution. Belgium were left stunned, unable to recover from the early blow. Veinante's name has remained part of France's World Cup folklore, with his strike celebrated for decades as one of the Fastest Goals in World Cup History. The fact that both he and Sweden's Arne Nyberg scored within 35 seconds in the same tournament adds an extraordinary chapter to football history. Veinante's strike not only showcased individual brilliance but also highlighted the value of momentum, proving how crucial the first minute can be in World Cup battles.

 

 

Bernard Lacombe earned his spot in the records with a goal against Italy at the 1978 FIFA World Cup in Argentina. Scoring just 31 seconds into the match, Lacombe delivered one of the Fastest Goals in World Cup History and gave France an unforgettable start. The goal came from a swift French attack where Lacombe, always alert inside the penalty area, seized the chance to score before the Italians could find their shape. Although France eventually lost the match, this moment remains one of the standout highlights of Lacombe's international career.

 

The 1978 World Cup was known for its fierce competition, but Lacombe's strike remains etched in memory because of its timing and precision. To score against Italy, a team renowned for defensive resilience, made the goal even more significant. Lacombe's strike showed that even defensive giants could be caught off guard in seconds. For French football, this goal symbolized hope and attacking intent, despite their ultimate elimination.

 

Clint Dempsey delivered one of the most famous moments in American football history when he scored after just 30 seconds against Ghana at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. His strike is firmly placed among the Fastest Goals in World Cup History, and it gave the United States a flying start in a group considered one of the toughest. Receiving the ball on the left, Dempsey cut inside, dribbled past a defender, and fired a precise low shot into the corner.

 

For the USA, this goal carried significant weight. They had faced Ghana in previous World Cups and suffered painful defeats, but Dempsey's strike set the tone for revenge. The early goal boosted confidence and showcased America's growing football presence. It remains one of the most replayed goals in US football history and underlined Dempsey's reputation as a leader and clutch performer. Even though the match was tense and ended in drama, Dempsey's lightning strike became a historic symbol of belief and determination.

 

Bryan Robson holds a special place in England's football history thanks to his rapid strike against France in the 1982 World Cup. Scoring in just 28 seconds, Robson etched his name among the Fastest Goals in World Cup History and gave England the perfect start to their campaign. His goal came after England pressed aggressively from the opening whistle. A long throw-in led to chaos in the French box, and Robson reacted quickest, smashing the ball into the net to send the England supporters into wild celebrations.

 

For England, this goal symbolized their ambition to return to the top of international football. Robson's leadership on the pitch was unmatched, and his goal demonstrated the effectiveness of starting matches with intensity. The strike stunned France, a strong European side, and gave England momentum in the tournament. While England eventually fell short, Robson's lightning goal remains one of the highlights of their World Cup history.

 

Germany's Ernest Lehner produced one of the earliest examples of rapid football brilliance when he scored in just 25 seconds against Austria at the 1934 World Cup. His strike ranks as one of the Fastest Goals in World Cup History and showed how quickly momentum could be seized, even in the sport's early years. Germany attacked immediately after kick-off, and Lehner's positioning allowed him to finish clinically. This goal stunned Austria and gave Germany the edge in one of the most competitive matches of the tournament.

 

Lehner's strike symbolized Germany's tactical discipline and readiness to capitalize on any opportunity. Scoring so quickly in a knockout World Cup match highlighted the high stakes and tension of international football. His goal also served as a reminder of Germany's growing reputation in world football during the 1930s. Though the tournament eventually ended with Italy as champions, Lehner's lightning strike remains celebrated as one of the Fastest Goals in World Cup History, cementing his place in football's record books

 

Vaclav Masek stunned the footballing world when he scored after only 15 seconds for Czechoslovakia against Mexico in the 1962 World Cup. His strike is remembered as one of the most iconic moments in the tournament's history and still ranks second in the list of the Fastest Goals in World Cup History. Right from kick-off, Czechoslovakia pushed forward aggressively. A quick pass found Masek, who took advantage of Mexico's unprepared defense to score with a calm finish.

 

Masek's goal carried huge significance and is remembered as one of the Fastest Goals in World Cup History. It represented the attacking spirit of Czechoslovakia during an era when they were considered one of Europe's rising football powers. Despite the match ending in defeat, the lightning strike gave Masek eternal recognition in World Cup lore. It highlighted how early determination and sharp execution could create lasting memories. For fans and players alike, Masek's goal is a reminder that games can be decided in moments, and history can be written in less than a quarter of a minute, solidifying its place among the Fastest Goals in World Cup History.

 

The record for the Fastest Goal in World Cup History belongs to Hakan Sukur of Turkey, who scored after just 11 seconds against South Korea in the 2002 World Cup. This strike remains unmatched to this day. In the third-place playoff, Sukur capitalized on a defensive error immediately after kick-off, blasting the ball past the Korean goalkeeper to put Turkey ahead. The goal shocked fans and set the tone for an entertaining game, which ended in a thrilling 3-2 victory for Turkey.

 

Sukur's achievement is legendary not only for its speed but also for its context. Turkey had enjoyed a remarkable run in the 2002 tournament, and this goal was the perfect climax to their fairy-tale campaign. For Sukur, a striker already considered one of the greatest in Turkish football history, the record became his defining legacy. His strike, now recognized among the Fastest Goals in World Cup History, has stood the test of time for more than two decades and continues to inspire players worldwide.

MIAMI BEACH, FLA. (WSVN) - Newly released body camera video shows officers arresting a man who, police said, brutally beat a German sports journalist who was visiting South Florida earlier this summer — and the suspect is no stranger to the law.

The bodycam video, obtained exclusively by 7News, captured the moment Miami Beach Police officers took Perry Smith into custody.

“Get your hand out of your pocket. Listen to me!” an officer tells Smith.

“Im listening,” says Smith.

“Pay attention!” says the officer.

Never before seen crime scene photos, also obtained by 7News, capture the extent of the injuries that Pit Gottschalk suffered back on June 27: a swollen, bloody eye, a bruised face and more bruising on his back.

7News broke the story of the attack. Gottschalk described the incident at the time.

“One fist hits me in the face, and the other one in the back.” he said.

Gottschalk said he was randomly attacked while on the Beachwalk near 27th Street.

The journalist had flown in from Germany to cover FIFA Club World Cup matches being held at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens.

But as he was walking back to his hotel that night, the victim found himself in the middle of a bare-knuckle fight of which he wanted no part.

“I tried to run and to escape from the situation,” said Gottschalk.

Police were flagged down, and within moments, officers located and apprehended the suspect.

“What's your first name?” an officer says in the bodycam video.

“Perry,” says Smith.

“Perry?” asks the officer.

“Yeah,” says Smith.

“Your last name? asks the officer.

“Smith,” says Smith,

Investigators and city officials said the suspect in the random attack is a familiar face.

“A repeat offender. Has a wrap sheet as long as my arm,” said Miami Beach Commissioner Tanya K. Bhatt.

Smith is well known to Miami Beach officers and victims of violent crime.

“He started saying, ‘You [expletive], you [expletive],' threw me on the floor,” said a victim in a prior incident.

“[He said], ‘Give me all your money now, or I'm going to hurt you,'” said Jo Manning, a victim in yet another incident.

City Commissioner Alex Fernandez did not mince worlds about Smith.

“This is a menace to society,” he said.

“He's attacking innocent people walking down the street,” said Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Mindy S. Glazer during an April 30, 2024 bond hearing.

A repeat felony offender, Smith has been in and out of jail, from Miami-Dade to Georgia, for attacks on women and men.

Last year, he received what city leaders and victims called a “sweetheart” plea deal after an attempted strong-arm robbery on Manning, who is in her 80s.

Smith is also a convicted sex offender. He now sits in the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center following his alleged encounter with Gottschalk, who had a “welcome to South Florida” moment he won't soon forget.

During his bond hearing on June 29, Smith didn't exactly make friends with Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Christine Hernandez.

“A $1,000 bond,” said Hernandez.

“And you're going to die a thousand deaths,” said Smith..

Smith faces a list of charges that include battery, resisting arrest and trespassing. His trial is pending.

SAN JOSE, Calif. (KGO) -- The countdown is on to 2026 in the South Bay, with Super Bowl 60, NCAA March Madness and the FIFA World Cup.

On Thursday, the city of San Jose revealed its game plan for all the excitement in order to create a successful year for the city in 2026.

"It's the first region to have a Super Bowl and a World Cup in the same year," San Jose Sports Authority Exec. Director John Poch said. "It's gonna reach out to a global audience and how many cities or counties have a global audience like we do?"

The region is built for this, but not without hard work to create a fan destination. Efforts are underway.

Thirteen concerts and 13 drone and light shows will make up 26 unique experiences, along with more than 100 watch parties.

"While there will be a handful of official events, we want to make sure that there's something to do 24/7 for the three or four days that people are here," Mayor Matt Mahan said. "And so, that's why we are raising money, hiring talent and putting on our own set local events."

Fun is planned in every district across the city, and it's highlighted by the new "San Jose 26" branding, which debuted Thursday.

Images of where events will take place -- the iconic places that make the city special -- can be found on a new website, which will help residents and visitors navigate all San Jose has to offer.

"It's a way to connect travelers, not only for the sporting events, but also for them to come back in future years and experience our city," said San Jose Mineta International Airport Director of Aviation Mookie Patel. "If you've lived here and you look at this artwork that's been created, you'll go, 'Wow, OK, I can see it.' This is San Jose."

It's part of a game plan, based on improving from our last Super Bowl 10 years ago, when San Francisco benefitted the most.

This time around, the South Bay economic impact will be off the charts. More than $1 billion is expected from roughly half a million fans, who will make their way to San Jose.

"What we're showing today is more than a brand. It's San Jose's identity," Mahan said. "Diversity and innovation all rolled into one. I can't wait to remind our residents what makes San Jose so special and share that with the world."

It's estimated that when people come to town for these major sporting events, they only spend about 5 to 10% of the time at the game itself.

San Jose leaders hope the work they're putting in will make it so the rest of their time is spent right here.

Tenth seed Lorenzo Musetti led 24th seed and close friend Flavio Cobolli 6-3, 6-2, 2-0 in the third round of the US Open Saturday when Cobolli retired due to injury.

“Honestly I didn't want to finish like that, especially against Flavio, who is probably my best friend on Tour,” Musetti said. “We know each other since [we were] nine years old and we know pretty well the families. We spend many, many hours together on the court and off the court throughout our careers. So first of all, a big round of applause to Flavio, please.”



Musetti arrived at the US Open having lost five of his previous six matches, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. But since losing his first set of the season's final major to big-serving Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, the Italian has been nearly flawless to reach the second week.

The 23-year-old Nitto ATP Finals hopeful broke Cobolli's serve five times and will next face Zizou Bergs or Jaume Munar. He leads Bergs 1-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, but trails Munar 1-2. 

“It's a bittersweet match and a bittersweet end, but of course I'm happy to be in the fourth round for the first time,” Musetti said. “I think I played a really great match until the last point. Of course Flavio, I could see that from the second set he was struggling a bit, but it was still tough to play against him and I wish him the best of luck to recover soon and to be healthy again.”

Cobolli explained that entering the match he knew he was "on my limit". This year's Bucharest and Hamburg champion, who received treatment during the clash on his arm, made clear he wanted to congratulate Musetti on his performance before revealing more about his injury.

"I had some cramps the other two matches in my fingers and also in my hand, but I played without any problem," Cobolli said. "Today I started my practice and I played without pain, but when I tried my serve I felt something not comfortable in the arm and it [got] worse in the match."

Musetti is ninth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin and is within 220 points of seventh-placed Jack Draper, who is out of the US Open. The Italian is trying to earn his place in Turin for the first time.

Six years after upsetting Simona Halep on Arthur Ashe Stadium, Taylor Townsend pulled off another Top 5 upset at the US Open, knocking out Mirra Andreeva to reach the fourth round for a second time.

NEW YORK -- Under the lights of Arthur Ashe Stadium, Taylor Townsend delivered one of the biggest surprises of the US Open, ousting No. 5 Mirra Andreeva 7-5, 6-2 in the third round.

Constantly moving forward and attacking, taking Andreeva out of her rhythm and serving impeccably, Townsend cruised to her third career Top 10 win, the first in more than two years.

It was over in 76 minutes.

US Open: Draws | Scores | Order of play

The postmatch handshake -- it was really just a meeting of hands -- passed quickly without incident.

“This feels good,” Townsend said in her on-court interview, clearly meaning it. “All I'm going to say is welcome to the show.

“I'm really just proud I kept amazing amazing.”

The 29-year-old American is more celebrated for her doubles play -- she's ranked No. 1 and is the reigning Australian Open champion with Katerina Siniakova.

But Townsend pulled off her first Top 10 win here six years ago, upsetting Simona Halep en route to the fourth round (losing to eventual champion Bianca Andreescu). She has impressed with her singles play this summer, advancing to the quarterfinals in Washington, D.C., as a qualifier and the third round in Cincinnati. In New York, Townsend beat Antonia Ruzic and No. 25 seed Jelena Ostapenko to reach the third round before notching her third career Top 10 win over Andreeva.

To Townsend, the circumstances this year were totally unlike her 2019 breakthrough.

"In 2019 I felt like I was climbing, and I was trying to get over the hump," she said. "There were so many opportunities where I almost got there and didn't get it, almost got there and didn't get it. I felt like that match, when I played Halep was a turning point for me where I got over that hump of finally just, I got one, you know what I'm saying?

"I just felt like it helped validate me as a player, and then I was able to continue, and then I ended up losing to Bianca in three sets and she ended up winning the tournament.

"This time it just feels completely different. I wasn't searching for anything, I wasn't looking, trying to find answers; I had all the answers in here. I was so confident and so sure of myself and what I was doing and how I was executing, that it didn't matter if I hit the back fence, hit the bottom of the net, it didn't matter. I just kept going.

"So it just felt completely different. I'm a totally different person than I was in 2019, and I think that that showed. That's what's really cool about tennis in these moments, you're able to reflect and look even at the mannerisms and how I carried myself then and now, you'll be able to see it's a different woman."

Townsend will play two-time major champion Barbora Krejcikova, a 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 winner over No. 10 Emma Navarro in a fourth-round match on Sunday. They're frequent rivals on the doubles court -- Krejcikova and Siniakova defeated Townsend and Caty McNally in the 2022 US Open final, and Krejcikova leads the doubles head-to-head 4-1 -- but have only met once in singles. That was all the way back in 2017, in the first round of an ITF W60 in Launceston, Australia. Krejcikova won 6-7(2), 6-2, 6-2.

On Wednesday night, after losing to Townsend 7-5, 6-1, Ostapenko confronted her at the net, clearly agitated and questioning her conduct and character.

Townsend, to her credit, took the high road.

“There's no beef on my side,” she said. “It's competition. People get upset when they lose. But you're not going to insult me, especially after I carried myself a certain type of way with nothing but respect. If I show respect to you, I expect respect as well.”

And after defeating Andreeva, she said she had moved on.

"I had doubles the next day," Townsend said. "So I had to get right back on the page, because at the end of the day, I would never allow any drama or anything on the outside to deter me from what my goal is when I step into the lines on the court. When I step into those gates, nothing that's happening on the outside matters ...

"I also really took the time to be intentional. To, like, shut it off. When I got to the hotel I said, 'OK, I'm done.' I put my phone down and I put it on 'do not disturb.' I stopped. In the morning I cut it off. So when it's time to do the job, it's time to do the job. And that's what I think is a testament to being professional, being able to block out what's on the outside and when you step in the lines you handle business."

It was the third incident of the fortnight regarding a breach of sportsmanship.

Daniil Medvedev was fined $42,500 for unsportsmanlike conduct and racket abuse following his first-round loss. Stefanos Tsitsipas confronted Daniel Altmaier about his underarm serving after a second-round loss.

After moving into the fourth round, No. 4 seed Jessica Pegula was asked about the unusual rash of post-match outbursts.

“Lots of drama,” she said, laughing. “My matches have been pretty no drama, so I'm not really sure what's going on with everybody else. It's just New York City tends to bring out just a lot of drama, I guess.

“I feel like the crowds, they're pretty crazy. They kind of get everyone riled up. Everyone is tense. It's the last slam of the season. Your last chance to go deep at a slam for a while. I think people maybe just get stressed out, and you're out there competing and fighting and trying to win.”

On Friday, it was Townsend who competed stronger.

The first set, a rollicking affair, featured two early breaks of serve and, at 5-all, a third by Townsend. She served it out, finishing with a 109 mph serve that was not returned.

Andreeva came out fast in the second, breaking Townsend for a 2-0 lead, but just as swiftly it was 2-all. Townsend converted her second break point for 3-2 when Andreeva dropped a backhand into the net.

With Townsend leading 4-2, for the third straight time, Andreeva fell behind love-40 on her serve. But after clawing back to deuce, Townsend took advantage of a double fault and stroked a forehand pass for her fifth straight game that gave her an insurmountable 5-2 lead.

Afterward, Townsend thanked her coach John Williams and four-year-old son Adyn Aubrey. She had warm words for those who have supported her in the 48 hours since the Ostapenko incident.

“It's bigger than me,” Townsend said. “It's about the message, about the representation. You guys saw the real Taylor Townsend tonight.

“The job's not done. We're staying on business.”

Six years after upsetting Simona Halep on Arthur Ashe Stadium, Taylor Townsend pulled off another Top 5 upset at the US Open, knocking out Mirra Andreeva to reach the fourth round for a second time.

Novak Djokovic finally has his teeth into the 2025 US Open.

After two unremarkable wins that drew more attention for his conditioning than his form, Djokovic produced a sharp 6-4, 6-7(4), 6-2, 6-3 victory over a competitive Cameron Norrie Friday night, albeit after more early-match drama surrounding his fitness.

“Yeah, it's all right,” Djokovic said coyly when asked about his back during his on-court interview. “You have some ups and downs… You don't want to reveal too much to the rivals listening and watching this interview. 

 “I'm good, man. I'm as young as ever, as strong as ever. Yes. It's New York. Even if you're feeling something body-wise, the energy that you're feeling in this court just overrides it.” 



The seventh seed played a lights-out first set in which he dropped just two points on serve and hit 17 winners, but an off-court medical time-out after the ninth game had fans inside Arthur Ashe Stadium concerned about his prospects.

The four-time US Open champion grabbed at his lower back late in the first set after an awkward movement at net to reflex back a ball that was above and behind his head. Before lining up to serve for the set at 5-4, the 38-year-old walked off Arthur Ashe Stadium to receive treatment in the locker room from ATP physio Clay Sniteman.

Djokovic was also treated at the first changeover of the second set but from that point looked largely free of discomfort for the remainder of the match.

In a high-quality contest, a bold Norrie hammered 44 winners, including 27 on the forehand wing. Djokovic hit 51 of his own, including 18 aces, a personal best at Flushing Meadows.

”Overall, it was probably the best serving performance of the tournament,” Djokovic said. “Of course, I'm glad for that. It's probably one of the most, if not, the most important shot in the game. So I'm glad how I executed that shot.”

In the fourth round Djokovic will face German Jan-Lennard Struff, who upset 2024 semi-finalist Frances Tiafoe 6-4, 6-3, 7-6(7). The seven-time Nitto ATP Finals champion, who has spent 428 weeks as World No. 1 during his career, is seeded to meet Taylor Fritz in the quarter-finals and Carlos Alcaraz in the semi-finals.

Djokovic won his 24th and most recent major at Flushing Meadows in 2023.

Norrie, No. 34 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, slipped to 0-11 against Top 10 players at the majors and 0-7 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series against Djokovic.

Fourth seed Fritz also had to navigate a tricky match, battling past Swiss qualifier Jerome Kym 7-6(3), 6-7(9), 6-4, 6-4 in two hours and 58 minutes.

“I've done a great job of just battling through these matches where it's easy to get frustrated, certain shots aren't working, maybe I'm not playing the level that I want to play,” Fritz said. “But I know, I keep telling myself, ‘Win the match, I get a day off, I can figure it out', and I can keep improving throughout this tournament.”

The defending finalist has now needed four sets in consecutive matches, but he delivered 20 aces against Kym and lost serve just once to avoid too much trouble. He will next take on 21st seed Tomas Machac, a 7-5, 6-3, 6-1 winner against Frenchman Ugo Blanchet earlier in the day.

Fritz will try to make the US Open quarter-finals for the third consecutive year. He recently made the Wimbledon semi-finals for the first time.

Karolina Muchova loves playing in New York, and she provided an inside look at how she spends her time, and how she gets her energy, when she's in the city for the US Open.

NEW YORK -- For Karolina Muchova, New York City is a happy place.

The Czech World No. 13 has reached the semifinals in Queens each of the past two years, and she always gets to celebrate her birthday in Manhattan. (It falls on August 21, just before the start of main-draw play.)

Now 29, Muchova prefers a calmer New York stay than when she played this tournament in her younger years: less of the glitz and more of the serenity (there is some in New York, believe it or not) and unique surroundings, like a casual morning stroll in Central Park with a cup of coffee. 

"I really love the park," she says. "I think the older I am, I'm going towards the park more than the party places. I love to walk there, take a coffee and just sit there on a rock and think, look at people."

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

But fewer "party places" certainly doesn't mean less fun. The former French Open finalist went to the Lady Gaga show at Madison Square Garden -- "It was unreal, I'm still recovering," she says -- and she often gets to a Broadway show, something she plans to do after her US Open run ends. And then there's the annual birthday dinner with friends -- this year it was Italian food -- that helps get her in the right frame of mind before the tournament begins.

She's explored different neighborhoods throughout the years, but feels most at peace uptown, in the shadow of the iconic 843-acre park that one can never get tired of exploring.

"Last year I stayed close to Flatiron," Muchova says. "I also went to Tribeca and Soho, which I loved so much. They're more, I would say, chill and [have] good shopping. This year I'm by the park, which I love so much. In the morning I call home because it's the afternoon in Europe. I've been to Brooklyn, but with tennis it's tough to explore it to the fullest."

Speaking of the tennis, Muchova remains one of the legit contenders in New York, though she generally falls a bit under the radar. So far, so good, though it's been anything but easy. 

Playing against Venus Williams, on Arthur Ashe Stadium, is hardly a breezy first round. In what was an extremely challenging environment -- she was clearly not the crowd favorite -- the former Top 10 player recovered after dropping the second set, with all the momentum against her, to win 6-3, 2-6, 6-1.

"It was for sure unique," Muchova said, "and it was special to play Venus on her home court. I could feel that the people were a lot on her side, and you're just there trying to do your best. It's a first match, so you kind of never know how you're gonna come to your first match. And she played really well. But in the end I managed to  focus on a third set, and I was just happy to get through. Every win is good for the confidence."

Her second-round match wasn't much easier. Competing against the fierce wind -- it was actually chilly in the late afternoon on Thursday -- and an experienced veteran in Sorana Cirstea, Muchova followed a similarly stressful path to victory, dropping the second set after winning the first before closing it out 7-6 (0), 6-7 (3), 6-4. 

"The fact that I love to play here helps," she says. "I get great energy, and the fact that I made the semis. ... I feel confident on this court. I think I'm still getting into my game, and I'm not so happy with the way I played, but I'm happy with the way I fought today."

Ben Shelton's US Open came to an end in the third round on Friday when he was forced to retire against Adrian Mannarino with the score level at two sets apiece.

After winning an epic set point to clinch the third, during which he took a tumble to the ground, Shelton began to feel sharp pain in his left shoulder in the opening game of the fourth. After saving a break point, the 22-year-old American signalled distress to his father and coach Bryan Shelton.

Although he did hold serve, he was forced to take a medical timeout three points into the ensuing game, later claiming to his box that it was the “worst pain I've ever felt in my life”. The No. 6 player in the PIF ATP Rankings continued on, but was visibly hindered as he attempted to rush the net on almost every point, a significant shift to the gruelling baseline exchanges the pair had enjoyed throughout the first three sets.

At the end of the fourth set, Shelton retired with the score at 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, 4-6.

The result is a huge blow for Shelton, who was aiming to strengthen his push for American No. 1, currently held by last year's finalist and World No. 5 Taylor Fritz. Amid a career-best season, highlighted by winning his first ATP Masters 1000 title in Toronto earlier this month, Shelton is fourth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin and hoping to make his debut at the Nitto ATP Finals in November.

A potential blockbuster quarter-final clash with Carlos Alcaraz was also looming for Shelton, who achieved his best result in New York in 2023 before falling to eventual champion Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals. The American owns a 37-18 tour-level record in 2025, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

“When he started to have pain, he was leading in the match,” Mannarino said in his on-court interview. “Honestly, he probably would've won that match. That's unfortunate for him, and lucky for me. I don't really know what to say right now. I'm happy to be through but I wish him the best, of course.”

Not the way we wanted it to end...

Shelton is forced to retire before the 5th set and Mannarino advances to the next round.

Wishing you a speedy recovery! @BenShelton @usopen | #USOpen pic.twitter.com/m31Vh7LwHd

Into the US Open fourth round for the first time in his career, Mannarino will face a maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with 20th seed Jiri Lehecka, who earlier eased past Raphael Collignon 6-4, 6-4, 6-4.

Prior to reaching the Wimbledon third round in June, Mannarino had just two tour-level wins to his name in 2025 and was as low as World No. 145 in March. The 37-year-old has since made the fourth round in Cincinnati, where he tested Jannik Sinner in two tight sets, and has climbed to No. 70 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings.

“I'm just trying… I'm 37 years old and it's the first time I'm winning a match from the toilet,” joked Mannarino. “There's always new things coming up and I'm just enjoying my time on the court. I hope I can extend it for a little while.

Before Shelton was forced to retire for the first time in his tour-level career, Mannarino tested the recent Toronto champion through four gripping sets. The Frenchman pulled the sixth seed away from his tradition first-strike brand of tennis and into entertaining baseline rallies. But after three hours and seven minutes, took the advice from his father Bryan to end the match.

“I was having good fun on the court, there were some really long rallies,” said Mannarino. “I was losing some, winning some, but I think it was a really cool match to play. Ben is playing really well, he kicked my ass at the beginning of the summer, but it was a great match. I was enjoying it, even if I was losing, it was a pretty cool match.”



Jan-Lennard Struff upset two-time US Open semi-finalist Frances Tiafoe 6-4, 6-3, 7-6(7) to reach the fourth round in New York for the first time and equal his best result at a major tournament. In a dramatic finish, the German failed to serve out the match at 5-3 in the third set before saving a set point in the tie-break en route to a two-hour and 10-minute victory.

Tiafoe, who was defeated by countryman Fritz in last year's semi-final, has dropped 12 spots to No. 29 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings following his third-round exit. The former World No. 10 leaves New York with a 26-19 record on the season.

“I think everybody knows it's tough to serve out a match,” Struff said in his on-court interview. “I think I played a very bad game there, three double faults, but I stayed very calm and managed to get some energy back, so I'm happy with that. [It was] an incredible match. I think I played very good tennis today.”

Having come through qualifying to reach the fourth round, Struff awaits a clash with four-time winner Novak Djokovic or British No. 2 Cameron Norrie.

It was a day built around former major winners challenging the current elite, with Marketa Vondrousova and Jessica Pegula delivering victories over Jasmine Paolini and Victoria Azarenka.

NEW YORK -- Friday's schedule at the US Open offered a rare thread: three recent Grand Slam winners, no longer among the top-ranked players, crossing paths with Top 10 seeds.

So, who came out on top? The in-form players or the former champs trying to recapture that major mojo?

As it turned out, two Czech Republic players who have been battling injuries were able to channel their past glories.

Marketa Vondrousova, Wimbledon's 2022 winner, took out No. 7 seed Jasmine Paolini in straight sets, while Barbora Krejcikova was a 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 winner over No. 10 Emma Navarro in a dramatic match that ran 2 hours and 30 minutes.

The only Top 10 seed to take out a former Slam winner? No. 4 Jessica Pegula, who defeated two-time Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka.

We break down those matches:

Vondrousova, who has been termed “tricky” and “crafty” can sometimes be difficult to solve. She's a clever lefty who likes to slice the ball -- but also has the ability to rip an ace right past you.

Two years ago, that diverse toolbox carried her to the title at Wimbledon.

On Friday Vondrousova booked a 7-6 (4), 6-1 victory over Paolini in a jam-packed Grandstand, reaching the fourth round of a major for the first time since last year's French Open.

Vondrousova's fourth-round match is against another recent Wimbledon champion, Elena Rybakina, who was an emphatic 6-1, 6-2 winner over Emma Raducanu.

“She's playing great tennis and won easily today,” Vondrousova said of Rybakina. “I have nothing to lose. I love these matches.

“It's incredible to be here again and play good tennis.”

Vondrousova's ranking of No. 60 suggests this was an upset, but it really wasn't. Vondrousova is now 2-0 against Paolini and this was her 15th career victory over a Top 10 player. The last one? A straight-sets semifinal victory over World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka on the grass in Berlin.

The first-set tiebreak was a tutorial in variety. Vondrousova mixed in a healthy dose of slices and finished points by switching back to topspin, while Paolini lost four of her five service points.

Up 6-2, Vondrousova converted her third set point when Paolini missed a backhand long, her scream showing how much it meant.

The second set was defined by the sixth game, when Vondrousova and Paolini locked into a terrific, back-and-forth contest. Vondrousova finally converted her sixth break point when a Paolini backhand stab sailed long -- leading to another scream.

“It was a very important game,” Vondrousova said. “Big difference between 4-2 and 5-1. It was a crazy game -- and the key to the match.”

Vondrousova won 48 of her 70 service points and was unbroken. She hit 22 winners, against 16 unforced errors.

Paolini, who was broken twice, is now 18-4 in majors when up against players outside the Top 50. She was attempting to become the first Italian woman to reach back-to-back fourth rounds at the US Open since Roberta Vinci in 2016.

Pegula crashed through a career-long barrier when she reached the US Open final a year ago. It came after a string of six straight losses in major quarterfinals.

After a disappointing first-round loss earlier this summer at Wimbledon, Pegula finds herself back in a familiar position -- the fourth round of a Grand Slam. Friday's 6-1, 7-5 win in Arthur Ashe Stadium came over two-time Australian Open champion Azarenka.

“Last year this place was really special,” Pegula said in her on-court interview. “I had some amazing moments on this court. My results weren't that amazing the last couple of months, so being able to turn it around really quickly was awesome.”

Next up for Pegula is the winner of the later match between Australian qualifier Priscilla Hon and Ann Li. 

It's been a dozen years since Azarenka defended her title at the Australian Open, those back-to-back victories representing the crowning glory of her career. She also made three US Open finals, in 2012, 2013 and 2020, falling to Serena Williams twice and Naomi Osaka.

Lately, though, it's been difficult.

Azarenka came into this US Open with a losing record and a ranking well outside the Top 100. But in one of her favorite cities, she put together back-to-back main-draw wins for the first time since last year's US Open, defeating qualifier Hina Inoue in the first round and then No. 45-ranked Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.

The 36-year-old player has struggled with injuries this year and looked uncomfortable losing the first 10 points to Pegula. It was a foreshadowing of the match to come, as Pegula powered through the 32-minute first set.

The second was far more competitive and, at 65 minutes, more than twice as long.

Azarenka started serving better and moving better, too.

When a Pegula backhand found the net, Azarenka found herself serving for the set at 5-4. But the comeback effort left her drained and Pegula won the last three games.

The two, who practice together often in Florida, embraced at net. Pegula, who converted six of 15 break points against Azarenka, now holds a 4-3 head-to-head advantage.

 “We know each other's games so well,” Pegula said. “I could tell she was struggling physically, so I just wanted to keep her moving.”

Krejcikova overcomes Navarro

Back in July, Navarro spoiled Krejcikova's Wimbledon title defense with a three-set, third-round victory. On Friday night, the two-time major champion returned the favor, coming back to defeat Navarro 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 in a streaky and entertaining Grandstand match in New York.

“It definitely was a huge match for me,” Krejcikova said afterward. “The crowd pumped me up -- it wasn't for me -- but thank you.”

After coming in with an 8-6 record, Krejcikova has put together three straight wins. This is the 27th of her career over a Top 20 player; the 26th came recently in Cincinnati over No. 13 Elina Svitolina.

Navarro was a semifinalist here a year ago, her best career result in a major. She had reached the fourth round in five of her past six majors.

After splitting the first two sets, Navarro won the first three games in the third, before Krejcikova flashed right back to win four straight herself.

The match came to a head with Krejcikova serving at 4-3. Navarro forged a pair of break points, but the Czech player fought them off with an unreturnable serve and bigger groundstrokes. Two backhand errors, forced by deep shots, gave Krejcikova that decisive game.

Krejcikova served it out and, after shaking hands with Navarro, let out a jubilant, furious roar.

 The difference? Krejcikova won the battle of service breaks, seven to six. She consistently hit bigger, as evidenced by her 33 winners and 53 unforced errors.

 

It was a day built around former major winners challenging the current elite, with Marketa Vondrousova and Jessica Pegula delivering victories over Jasmine Paolini and Victoria Azarenka.

 Ugo Blanchet remembers the moment he needed to make a change. 

 “It was my 22nd birthday,” the Frenchman recalled to ATPTour.com at the US Open. “I was World No. 900. Still a good player, because No. 900 is already a good level of tennis. But my parents paid for everything. I had a girlfriend, and I couldn't buy her anything. So I said to myself, ‘If I really want to do this job, I have to change quickly to try to have a real chance to play in bigger tournaments.' 

 “Now my girlfriend is much happier.” 

 Blanchet may deliver that story in a slightly light-hearted manner, but it is a fitting anecdote that helps summarise his tennis journey so far. He had already turned 26 when he made his Grand Slam main-draw debut in May at Roland Garros, making him a late bloomer in comparison to the majority of his peers. Despite that long wait, he holds no regrets. 

 “I think everybody has their own path,” said Blanchet. “Mine has been longer, because I was not very professional in my approach to practising and playing. I think some players understood it sooner than me, but at the end it's okay. I learned later than most other players who are here, but I am happy.” 



 Last week, Blanchet's girlfriend and parents were in New York to watch him drop just one set across three qualifying matches at the US Open. They have all since had to return to France for work, but he remains well-supported at Flushing Meadows by his coach, former World No. 50 Stephane Robert. 

 The departure of most of his entourage has done little to stall Blanchet's progress. On his US Open main-draw debut on Sunday, he saw off Fabian Marozsan in four sets. Three days later, he stunned the fast-rising #NextGenATP Czech Jakub Mensik in a five-set thriller. A memorable moment, but Blanchet is eager for more. 

 “I'm really happy with the win,” said Blanchet of his 6-7(2), 7-6(5), 3-6, 6-4, 7-6(10-7) triumph against the 16th-seeded Mensik. “My first one in five sets and my first time into the third round of a Grand Slam, and first win against a Top 20 player. But at the end of the day, it is just five sets. I need to prove it multiple times against these players to say that my level is really high and that I can compete with these guys the whole year.”

 Competing in New York as the World No. 184, Blanchet's off-court passions include following French football powerhouse Olympique de Marseille, while he also identifies himself as a huge ‘Potterhead'. 

 "I am a big fan of Harry Potter. I went to London to visit the studios and I've read all the books in French, and in English to learn [the language better]," said Blanchet. "I think they are better in English, but because of my [reading] level, I prefer them in French.” 

 Blanchet's time so far this summer in New York has been all about tennis, however, and he will head into his third-round meeting with 21st seed Tomas Machac flying high with confidence. Should the Frenchman win, he will surpass his career high of No. 139 in the PIF ATP Rankings after the US Open. 

 “The journey has been good,” said Blanchet, reflecting on his five wins so far in New York. “I think since my first match I've played really good tennis, so I'm happy with my level. I have good confidence in my game so I'm happy to come here and get some victories. 

 “These past two matches I think it was tough to stay focused on the game because I was already happy with qualifying, but I wanted more, so I am happy to be here.”

After a relatively uncomplicated first set on Friday night, breaking in the seventh game of the match en route to clinching the opening frame, Djokovic looked like he was about to start cruising to a straight-set victory in the second set, not only bringing up triple break point with Norrie serving at 3-all, 0-40, but—after missing out on those opportunities—also moving ahead 3-1 in the tie-break.Norrie came alive at that moment, though, winning six of the next seven points to sneak out the breaker and even the match up at a set apiece—he then broke Djokovic in the first game of the third set, as an upset started looking more and more like a possibility.But it wasn't to be, as Djokovic not only broke right back in the next game, but ended up winning the next four games in a row to re-take control of the match, eventually closing out the third set, jumping out to a 3-0 lead in the fourth set and cruising to victory from there."Particularly third and fourth kind of started swinging through the ball a bit more," Djokovic said after the match. "And honestly, I was pleasantly surprised with Norrie's level. I think he was playing really aggressive. I was not used to him playing so close to the line and just really taking the ball early, particularly on the forehand side."Credit to him for fighting and playing some really good level, particularly in the second set and beginning of the third. But I guess when it mattered, I came up with some really good points, good shots, good serves. Serving performance definitely the best so far."Yeah, these kind of matches and performances always give me hope that I can go far, challenge the best players in the world."

Awaiting the No. 7-seeded Djokovic in the fourth round will be one of the giant-killers of the tournament, Jan-Lennard Struff, a former No. 21 who's currently ranked No. 144, came through the qualifying and has taken out No. 11 seed Holger Rune and No. 17 seed Frances Tiafoe to reach the fourth round of the US Open for the first time.It's his third time reaching the fourth round of any Grand Slam tournament, having gotten this far at Roland Garros in 2019 and 2021.The wins will only get harder for the German on Sunday, though, as he faces Djokovic, against whom he's 0-7—and an even more daunting 1-17 in sets. They've met once before at the US Open, with the Serb prevailing in the third round in 2020, 6-3, 6-3, 6-1.

Carlos Alcaraz reassured his fans Friday afternoon that there is no reason for concern regarding his right knee.

The Spaniard took a medical timeout at 5-4 in the second set of his US Open match against 32nd seed Luciano Darderi to receive treatment on the knee. But it was ultimately just a precaution and the 2022 champion did not lose a game the rest of the match.

“That game that he broke my serve, on the last point after the serve, the first step, I just felt something in the knee that, it was [bothering] me,” Alcaraz said. “But after five, six points, it was gone. 

“I was worried after that [moment]. That why I asked for the physio, but it was nothing serious, so just for precaution. After that, I just didn't feel it anymore, and it was good. So it's just nothing serious.”

One year ago, Alcaraz suffered a shock defeat in the second round of the season's final major to Botic van de Zandschulp. The second seed has made clear he has no intention of allowing something similar to happen again, dropping just 23 games through three matches, including only 10 games in his second and third rounds combined.

“I'm just trying not to do the same things as last year. Trying to improve and do the things much better. Every time that I step on the court, I'm just locked in since the first point until the last one,” Alcaraz said. “I'm taking last year as motivation coming into this year, [to] be more hungry, ambitious to do great things here. 

“This is a place that I love playing. The energy is crazy, so I'm just trying to feel the love and the energy from the people much more and playing as [many] matches as I can, so that motivates me.”

Alcaraz will next face Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech, who is into the fourth round of a major for the first time aged 30. The No. 2 player in the PIF ATP Rankings leads their Lexus ATP Head2Head series 3-0, including a victory at the 2021 US Open and another earlier this year at Queen's Club.

“He's really difficult to play against, really aggressive, big serve, trying to go to the net, so it's going to be really difficult,” Alcaraz said. “But as I said, I'm just trying to be focused on myself, that I'm playing great tennis, and I'm feeling really comfortable physically, mentally, and just feeling the ball really well.

“I will try to think just about my goals, about myself, and let's see, but it's going to be a really interesting one.”

NEW YORK—Win or lose, Coco Gauff is having a US Open to remember after reaching the third round amid emotional upheaval and major technical changes to her serve.The No. 3 seed, Gauff served seven double faults and was near tears in the opening set of her second-round clash with Donna Vekic, but ultimately tightened up her technique to defeat the 2024 Olympic silver medalist, 7-6 (5), 6-2. Both the result and Gauff's determination drew praise from the Tennis Channel Live at the US Open panel Friday morning.“Big picture, this is a remarkable story of resilience in an athlete,” said Jim Courier, former world No. 1. “She is so vulnerable in full view at the biggest tennis tournament in America.

This will be a big part of that because I'm sure this is going to be a pivot point with her serve, and it's going to be something she will ultimately put behind her. But the emotions of these moments, it is really theatrical. She is inspirational for all of us, incredible.”

Lindsay Davenport called Gauff's mid-match emotions “heartbreaking” as the reigning Roland Garros champion struggled to employ changes made by biomechanic coach Gavin MacMillan, an expert hired after Gauff's serving woes carried throughout the US Open swing.MacMillan famously reworked the serve of Aryna Sabalenka, who went on to win three Grand Slam titles and rise to her current spot as world No. 1.“In tennis, what you don't want to do is overthink,” said Davenport, a fellow former No. 1 and 1998 US Open champion. “She's now trying to learn new grips and new technique, and it's just all too much for her.

“If you're trying something new and you have no idea how it's going to turn out,” advised Navratilova of Gauff's serve, “especially when you don't have any confidence, you really need to do it in a quiet space.”

“It seems like everyone's got to take a step back and just say, ‘You know what? Just go play. Go try and figure out this last major of the year. Then we can catch our breath.'”In her visit to the TC Live desk, Martina Navratilova is also waiting for Gauff to exhale, the 18-time Grand Slam champion questioning the wisdom of attempting a technical overhaul in the midst of a major tournament.“If you're trying something new and you have no idea how it's going to turn out, especially when you don't have any confidence, you really need to do it in a quiet space,” advised Navratilova. “I don't want anybody watching me except my coach and the cameras doing the video so I can figure it out.”

Chanda Rubin was more optimistic about Gauff's chances in Flushing Meadows, noting the 2023 champion's marked improvements in the second set versus Vekic, and from a tense first-round against Ajla Tomljanovic.“Overall, this was not a bad match in terms of numbers,” said Rubin, a 1996 Australian Open semifinalist. “In terms of her serving and the double faults in the first set, it was the timing of it and it was all of the stress, all of the emotion she's been dealing with. It was about much more than just the X's and O's on the court.

“I think we saw, again, how impressive Gauff is, the fact that she was able to turn that first set around. She was able to dig in and somehow win it. At times, she was visibly shaking during the changeovers and it was just so incredible how she, once again, dug in and didn't let the moment overwhelm her completely. Getting that first set was huge and she was able to run away with the second set in the end.”Gauff will be back on court on Saturday when she takes on No. 28 seed Magdalena Freçh for the chance to reach the second week of the US Open for a fourth straight year.

Carlos Alcaraz suffered the first mid-match wobble of his US Open campaign on Friday, but he nonetheless refound his rhythm to defeat Luciano Darderi 6-2, 6-4, 6-0 and reach the fourth round.

Leading by a set and 4-1, Alcaraz lost serve for the first time this week and was pulled into a second-set battle, during which he appeared to land awkwardly after a serve. The 22-year-old Spaniard took a medical timeout at 5-4 to receive treatment on his right knee, but reeled off the following seven games to regain control and race through a one-hour, 44-minute victory.

“I'm feeling good, it was just a precaution that I asked for the physio,” Alcaraz said when asked about the medical timeout. “When he broke my serve, in the last point I felt something in the knee, but after five or six points it was gone. I just asked the physio to take care of the knee, so I had to be feeling good. I am going to talk to my team about it, but I'm feeling good.”

Alcaraz, who won his first major title at the US Open in 2022, remains on track to meet four-time winner Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals. For now, though, Alcaraz faces a fourth-round clash with Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech, who rallied past countryman Benjamin Bonzi 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-2. Alcaraz leads Rinderknech 3-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

Despite his brief lapse in the second set, Alcaraz was ruthless in all departments, particularly the forehand-to-forehand exchanges that were prevalent throughout the clash. In the second set, however, Darderi produced some moments of magic of his own, including winning an epic all-court point that ended with a stunning drop volley that caught Alcaraz out to tee up two break points, eventually converting the second.

“I just tried to start awake, that was important,” said Alcaraz. “Starting at 11:30 a.m. is not a schedule that I'm used to playing, so my first goal is to start well, to start focused. I think I started really well, pushing him to the limit, playing long rallies, and after that kept it going.

“I'm not a [morning] person. For me, it's difficult to wake up in the mornings, so that's a good thing today that I woke up early, I did the warmup well, played good... It seems like I'm a Spanish guy!"

2025 Dutch GP Qualifying: Verstappen frustrated with Norris in Q2

Matt Youson takes a look at the different pit stop and tyre options that are available to the teams in the Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort.

McLaren's MCL39 is proving to be an excellent all-rounder – but the thing it likes best is medium-speed corners, and there's a lot of those at Zandvoort. The result, in qualifying, was Oscar Piastri pipping Lando Norris to pole, as the papaya cars locked out the front row.

Behind them, it's more of a Stroopwafel-fight. Max Verstappen will start third – but Isack Hadjar did a magnificent job to join him on the second row, ahead of George Russell and the Ferraris.

On race day there will be different tyre strategies in play, and capricious weather around to mix things up. So let's take a look at the tactical options the teams have when the lights go out…

2025 Dutch GP Qualifying: Verstappen frustrated with Norris in Q2

After setting the pace during Friday's first practice hour, Lando Norris again led the way in Free Practice 2 at the Dutch Grand Prix.

Lando Norris continued his pace-setting form through to a busy second practice at the Dutch Grand Prix, the Briton going fastest after earlier topping the timesheets in FP1.

In a session that saw two red flag phases, Norris put himself on top with his lap of 1m 09.890s, putting him 0.087s clear of Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso in second while the other McLaren of Oscar Piastri was just two thousandths of a second behind the Spaniard in third.

It was a more challenging outing for Alonso's team mate Lance Stroll, who suffered a heavy crash that resulted in the first stoppage. Fortunately the Canadian reported that he was okay.

Meanwhile another red flag was thrown when Alex Albon beached his Williams in the gravel later on in the hour, while Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar sparked a Virtual Safety Car when he pulled off track with an issue.

F1 Academy Highlights: 2025 Dutch GP Race One

2025 Dutch GP Qualifying: Verstappen frustrated with Norris in Q2

Isack Hadjar will start Sunday's Dutch Grand Prix from fourth place after securing a Formula 1 career-best grid position.

Isack Hadjar registered the best Qualifying result of his fledgling Formula 1 career, as he set the fourth-fastest time on Saturday.

Racing Bulls rookie Hadjar will start from the second row of the grid for the first time after putting in a scintillating performance at Zandvoort. Lining up alongside Red Bull driver Max Verstappen, only the four-time champion and the two McLaren drivers start ahead of the Frenchman.

His previous best result was a sixth place in Qualifying for the Monaco Grand Prix.

“I'm feeling great! An amazing Qualifying,” said Hadjar. “Honestly, yesterday was a complete disaster for me, so it was really unexpected.

“This morning, I had a really good feeling, but we knew it would be very hard to reach Q3, and actually, both of us [Racing Bulls drivers] managed to reach Q3.

“He [team mate Liam Lawson] was really pushing me hard, and I put it all on the line on that final lap and put it all together. It was a great lap, so I'm happy.”

Without a point in five races, Hadjar added: “It gives me a lot of confidence, because recently, I've felt like maybe our race pace has been a bit better. I think the car is really healthy around here. Liam [Lawson] was quite fast on the long run on Friday, so it gives us a lot of confidence going into the race.”

Lawson will start from eighth place on Sunday, but was left frustrated by a lack of improvement between Q2 and Q3.

“It's good to be in Q3. It was very promising out there throughout Qualifying,” said the New Zealander. “I don't really know why, but we went slower in Q3, so there's some stuff to look into. I think we were feeling quite good after Q2 and naturally, everyone makes a step into Q3, but for some reason, we didn't make a step.

“It's very sensitive here. It's obviously a tricky lap, and getting the balance right with this wind is tough. It's frustrating, because I think we had good potential.

“We need a good start and to try to stay where we are, and then let's see. It's going to be a hard race, that's for sure. It's very physical here, so it's probably going to be a long day.”

Grab your tissues, Hallmarkies. On August 29, 2025, the stars of Hallmark's blockbuster “Three Wise Men” franchise wrapped filming their third — and likely final — with an emotional group hug caught on video. 

Production manager Rob Lycar posted touching footage of stars Tyler Hynes, Andrew Walker, Paul Campbell, Margaret Colin, and Kimberley Sustad gathering in a circle with Hallmark director Terry Ingram after three weeks of filming “Three Wisest Men.” 

Lycar captioned the video, “That's a wrap on the 3 Wisemen trilogy! Massive congratulations to Terry Ingram on his 50th Hallmark movie and thank you to the talented cast and crew for their hard work. We have an incredibly funny & heartwarming movie here!”

A post shared by Rob Lycar (@lickylicks)

Lycar added James Blunt's tearjerker “Goodbye My Lover” under his video of the primary cast huddled with Ingram, sharing their gratitude for each other and joking that Ingram could now “retire” after the incredible feat of directing 50 Hallmark movies. 

In the background, someone could be heard yelling, “That's a wrap!” The video ended after Hynes gave a kiss to the camera, sending love to all the fans who've made the franchise such a huge success.  

Lycar's followers swooned over the video, with many noting in the comments how “beautiful” it was to watch. One person wrote, “Amazing & beautiful video🎬. Now the exciting part seeing it all come together on the big screen 📺❤️🎄💚”

Another commented, “What a lovely hallmark family😍. Can't wait for WM3!👏❤️”

The cast surprised fans in July by announcing a third movie was in the works. The original “Three Wise Men and a Baby” was the most-watched cable movie of the year when it premiered in 2022. A sequel, “Three Wiser Men and a Boy,” was Hallmark's second-most-watched movie of 2024, just behind the NFL-themed “Holiday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story,” which also starred Hynes. 

“Three Wisest Men” is scheduled to premiere as part of Hallmark Channel's 2025 Countdown to Christmas movie lineup, though an exact date has not been announced yet. 

A post shared by Tyler Hynes (@tyler_hynes)

The cast's wrap day embrace was especially bittersweet, given that “Three Wisest Men” will likely be the last movie in the franchise — at least for some time. 

In July, before filming began in Vancouver, Walker told EntertainmentNow, “This is a wrap-up movie. So you're going to see a lot of people that you've seen in the previous movies. I'd work with this group of people for the rest of my career, you know? But we can't be selfish with what we want.” 

Walker continued, “I think what's best for this story in particular — and the ‘Wise Men' franchise has been really good to all of us — is that I think that sometimes if you overdo it, it loses its allure.”

But Walker said he foresees working again with Hynes, Campbell, and Sustad on unrelated projects in the future, telling EntertaimentNow that the group of tight-knit friends has already discussed other possibilities for collaboration. But first, they've got a highly anticipated movie to promote, completing their fun-loving, heartfelt “Wise Men” trilogy. 

“We're really happy to just get this third opportunity to do this, and to kind of, you know, tie it up with a bow and send it off and maybe create something fresh,” he said.

One year after premiering 'Conclave' in the Rockies, Edward Berger returned to unveil his latest film, a portrait of a gambling addict in Macao whose luck is running out.


							By 

	Scott Feinberg


Executive Editor of Awards


	Few people in the film industry have had a more impressive last few years than Edward Berger, who directed 2022's All Quiet on the Western Front, for which he was Oscar-nominated, and 2024's Conclave, for which he should have been, and Colin Farrell, who starred in 2022's The Banshees of Inisherin, which brought him a long-overdue first Oscar nom, Thirteen Lives and The Batman, to say nothing of the 2024 limited series The Penguin, for which he is currently Emmy-nominated.


	Therefore, it was rather exciting to learn that the two had joined forces for Ballad of a Small Player, a film about a self-destructive gambling addict and con artist in present-day Macao who grows increasingly desperate as his luck runs out. Adapted by Rowan Joffe from Lawrence Osborne's 2014 novel of the same name, and also featuring Fala Chen and Tilda Swinton in supporting roles, Ballad had its world premiere at the Telluride Film Festival's Werner Herzog Theater on Friday night.

	I'm pleased to report that it is a funny, sad, stylish and altogether entertaining time at the movies. It's also completely different from the two aforementioned Berger films, in terms of size and tone. Those were large-scale epics about matters of social consequence, and became across-the-board Oscar contenders, landing nine and eight noms, respectively. This one is more of an intimate character study and, for me, evoked memories of 2015's Mississippi Grind, 2019's Uncut Gems and, of course, 1974's and 2014's The Gambler. As far as awards, I suspect attention will largely center on Farrell's tour-de-force turn and Joffe's colorful screenplay, both of which could well be Oscar-nominated.

Guillermo del Toro‘s adaptation of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein launched at the Venice Film Festival this evening and the notices are coming in.


	Oscar Isaac stars as Dr. Victor Frankenstein, the brilliant but egotistical scientist who brings a creature (Jacob Elordi) to life in a monstrous experiment that ultimately leads to the undoing of both the creator and his tragic creation.


	The early reaction from critics on the Lido has been all over the map, with some raves, some middling scores and some who didn't gel with the movie — or its leads — at all.

	Deadline's Pete Hammond praised the acting and directing: “[Del Toro's] love for monsters is unquestioned, and even though Frankenstein has been a horror staple for nearly a century in cinema, del Toro here turns it into a fascinating and thoughtful tale on what it means to be a human, and who is really the monster? Do we have aspects of both in us?”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	He continued: “Elordi is very fine in quite a different kind of role for him, and physically he really fits the bill. Isaac is enormously fun to watch as he slips further into madness, with a fake leg, lots of prosthetics and makeup effects, and an ego with no end.”


	He was also one of many to laud the production value of the $120M movie but question the running time: “Production values are over the moon, with beautiful production design by Tamara Devenell and great creature design from Mike Hill keeping it all tight. At 2 1/2 hours it perhaps might have been shortened, but del Toro's sandbox is so irresistible, the return to big Hollywood moviemaking so pronounced, it must be hard to stop. Once a filmmaker on the scale of del Toro gets unleashed in the lab, why cut it short?”


	The Guardian described the film as “bombastic but watchable” in a three star review: “The visual style of the movie is utterly distinctive and unmistakably that of Del Toro: a series of lovely, intricate images, filigreed with infinitesimally exact cod-period detail; deep focus but also strangely depthless, like hi-tech stained glass or illustrated plates in a Victorian tome; pictures whose luxurious beauty underscores the film's reverence for the source material and for itself, but which for me impedes the energy of horror.”

	











	HeyUGuys also gave the film three stars: “Del Toro paints a picture of man's hubris and the monstrosity of those who relentlessly seek something with no consideration for anyone else. Perhaps he could have done this with a more nuanced touch, but subtlety has never been a Del Toro strongpoint. This is true of the screenplay (written by Del Toro), the costumes and the set design (by Tamar Deverell). Think Mary Shelley meets Crimson Peak. If you loved that film, you'll love this.”


	Geoffrey MacNab, writing for the UK's Independent, was ultimately unimpressed, saying “del Toro's elegant adaptation is all show and little substance” and that “Isaac's performance is mannered and uneven”: “Unfortunately, Frankenstein continually risks losing its footing. The film lurches between scenes of lush romantic melodrama and moments of Grand Guignol bloodletting. We know very quickly that the monster cannot die. That means any suspense risks ebbing away. For all Del Toro's formal mastery, this Frankenstein is ultimately short of the voltage needed really to bring it to life.”


	However, The Wrap was a big fan, saying: “The passion drips from every frame of del Toro's epic reimagining… It's a filmmaker returning to his roots at a time when he has the skills to make those roots grow into something huge and singular…His Frankenstein is a titanic piece of work, two and a half hours that bend Shelley's framework to contain nearly everything we've loved about this story of the brilliant but foolhardy scientist and his fearsome creation.”


	So too was The South China Morning Post which gave it 4.5/5 stars: “This ‘modern Prometheus' tale, to borrow from Shelley's subtitle, has been told many times on film, with varied results. But unquestionably, Del Toro's version is the most beautiful, perhaps the most definitive…Nodding to Milton's Paradise Lost, and the Fall of Man, Del Toro manages to create a work both scholarly and uproariously entertaining.”


	The Times Of London calls the film a “camp and messy reboot” in which “Jacob Elordi lacks menace”, but Games Radar gives it four out of five stars: “Masterfully concocted and pertinent in theme, Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein is a classy, if somewhat safe, adaptation with awards legs.”


	Variety says the director's passion project “has been gestating so long, the master's creation arrives overstuffed and unwieldy…What should have been the perfect pairing of artist and material proves visually ravishing, but can't measure up to the impossibly high expectations del Toro's fans have for the project.”


	The trade adds: “In principle, del Toro has gone back to the book for his two-and-a-half-hour magnum opus, which cost more than Titanic and still looks like it was made for TV (as much as that pains me to say).”


	The Hollywood Reporter saw more it liked in the movie, calling it an “emotionally charged take” on the classic story, while Indiewire gave the film a B score, praising Elordi and the scale of the film but also finding some flaws, describing it as a “big, juicy, glossy, expensive mounting of the Mary Shelley classic novel for Netflix, that lacks the voiciness, the edge, the perverse streak of del Toro's great run of films.”


	At Netflix's Tudum event earlier this year, Del Toro called the film “the culmination of a journey that has occupied most of my life,” adding, “Monsters have become my personal belief system. There are strands of Frankenstein through my films.”

	











	Coming off his third Oscar win for Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio, another literary adaptation for Netflix, Del Toro's Frankenstein also stars Mia Goth (X), Felix Kammerer (All Quiet on the Western Front), Lars Mikkelsen (The Witcher), David Bradley (Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio), Christian Convery (Sweet Tooth), Charles Dance (Game of Thrones) and Christoph Waltz (Inglourious Basterds).


	Del Toro directed from his own script and produced alongside J. Miles Dale and Scott Stuber.

What is the point of reviewing Del Toro's films?  Nobody else is making films like he is.  His films are always worth watching.  Does anyone want a world without Del Toro making films?  And does anyone truly have a clue how he could improve his films?  Really?  If so we're all waiting for you to make those films.  Please.  What is holding you back?

This is such a laughably stupid comment. “I don't agree with you, therefore your review shouldn't exist and no one else should review Del Toro's movies, unless they can make movies themselves”.  You should be embarrassed.

My name; it's pronounced ‘Fronkensteen.'

Usually, getting in trouble with the Secret Service is no laughing matter. But 88-year-old Hollywood icon Dyan Cannon — a three-time Oscar nominee who co-starred in Hallmark's 2008 movie “A Kiss at Midnight” — couldn't stop laughing after agents denied her access to the White House over questions about her age.

In an Instagram video that Cannon posted on August 28, 2025, she could be seen laughing as her dear friend, lifestyle expert Kym Douglas, described what happened. 

Douglas, who was a frequent contributor to Hallmark's former talk show “Home & Family,” posted her own video of the debacle, writing, “We almost got arrested in Washington due to one of us lying to Secret Service Agents.”

A post shared by Dyan Cannon (@therealdyan.cannon)

Cannon was in Washington D.C. with Douglas, 66, and friends Tracy Bregman, 62, and Christine Avanti-Fischer, 54. The foursome co-hosts a new podcast called “God's Table.” With Cannon doubled over in laughter as they stood outside the White House gates, Douglas explained the situation in her video.

“We're lined up for a great tour,” she said, and then panned her camera to show authorities standing nearby. “We have the Secret Service guys and all the federal agents. We can't get in because someone lied about their age.”

Cannon, still laughing, then confessed, “All right, girls, listen. Years ago, here's the thing, I lied about my age on my passport.” 

After the women laughingly marveled at how Cannon managed to pull that off, she said, “Listen, it doesn't matter — keep lying about your age!” 

The video Douglas shared showed that the women were eventually cleared and allowed to enter the White House for their tour. But Cannon has no regrets about trying to cover up her real age. 

She captioned her post, “And I'd do it again… it's nobody's business what the number is they've pinned on me ….right girls? Right guys? it's just a blinkin number… no matter what number they put next to me there's one thing that never changes …I WUV WU‼️. Ps those securitvguards were so handsome!!!”

Fans loved the funny video and Cannon's perspective on aging, flooding her post with comments. One of them wrote, “Dyan has laughed her whole life that's why she's so energetic and enthusiastic and positive!!! 😍👍”

Another cheered, “You go, Dyan! You're right: it's no one's business! I love how you enjoy life! Keep shining!”

Someone else chimed in, “Hysterical!! Have fun beauties!! Love your joyful energy!! 🤩✨”

Cannon hasn't let her age slow her down, including in her dating life. Married twice, including to Hollywood legend Cary Grant, Cannon told People in April she was seeing “several special (people)… I have friends with benefits, yes.”

Guillermo del Toro is such a revered artist and an adored man that his status as a cheerleader of filmmaking craftspeople and hands-on artisans, his adulation for the art form itself, and his fight to keep it alive against the headwinds of artistry-crushing change might seem to overshadow the actual work. A genius who's not another brilliant asshole? A filmmaker who's generous with his time and attention and emotion? That's rare.

“Nightmare Alley” was a dreary mess, but who else could have nearly pulled off a remake of an obscure noir picture lost to time, retrofitted with style and glaze for the modern era? Who thought we needed another “Pinocchio” movie until del Toro turned the Italian fable into a stop-motion marvel, a film that prioritized actual human art-making over AI, CGI, and even that other I, IP, for its own sake?

His version of “Frankenstein,” a big, juicy, glossy, expensive mounting of the Mary Shelley classic novel for Netflix, lacks the voiciness, the edge, the perverse streak of del Toro's great run of films from the ‘90s and into the early aughts, from “Cronos” and “Mimic” to “The Devil's Backbone” and “Pan's Labyrinth.” The kindly, curious Mexican auteur has made fairytales, the stuff of the heart-rending and primal in terms of our need for love and perhaps a storybook ending — other than “Nightmare Alley,” which smacked of his wunderkind nihilistic streak, despite its shortcomings —  his career calling-card in recent years, whether “Pinocchio” or Best Picture winner “The Shape of Water.”

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Francis Ford Coppola's blood-soaked, bawdy, and shamelessly ludicrous “Bram Stoker's Dracula” his “Frankenstein” is not — though there are, like “Shape of Water,” plenty of smashed-in heads and dislocated jawbones in del Toro's Shelley adaptation. But he's opted for a gentler take on the monster classic, previously erected on Hollywood soundstages by the likes of James Whale and Kenneth Branagh.

Within that mode, star Jacob Elordi plays the reanimated, sutured-from-refuse corpse known as Victor Frankenstein's monster in the most psychologically complex portrayal of the creature since Boris Karloff threw a little girl into a lake. In past versions or retreads, the monster is sometimes the butt of the joke, or simply called Frankenstein (even though that's his maker's name) and afforded little emotional window in service of broader paeans to the dangers of playing God and meddling with natural law. Elordi moves with the physically searching quality of a marionette newly detached from its strings. As the creature, he comes to acquire a voice and autonomy and personhood that transcend any kind of nonverbal grunting often assigned to this character.

Elordi, who has given consistently beautiful, sometimes flinty, ever uncategorizable and resistant-to-trend performances throughout his still-rising career, brings a quiet watchfulness to this Frankenstein's monster, and he becomes the soul of a movie that may not have had one without him.

 










That's still to say that storytelling and performance become secondary and tertiary to del Toro's primary objective of spinning lavish, beautiful, hand-mounted movies bolted down to the Earth by the tactility of their creation. There are hints of the Freudian in his screenplay for this “Frankenstein,” as Victor's (Oscar Isaac) fetishization of his dead mother not only leads to his enterprising of bringing back to life dead soldiers, but also feeds the rather sudden flush of ardor he feels for Elizabeth Lavenza (Mia Goth), the fiancée of his younger, sprightlier, springier brother (Felix Kammerer). 

Del Toro goes as far as to cast Goth as said dead mother also, literalizing the Oedipal undertow of Shelley's text. It's a little unsubtle, and whileyou don't buy his obsession with Elizabeth (which gets little screen time), it's suggestive of something weirder, kinkier, fleshier writhing beneath “Frankenstein's” relatively digestible, classically solid surface.

Elordi, painted with a funereal pallor and limned with a drawn-on musculature that resembles one of those stripped-of-their-skin anatomy mannequins in museums, suffuses del Toro's fabulous visceral creation with a real psychological pull. (Speaking of museums, it's hard not to think about, watching “Frankenstein,” how everything onscreen, every stitch of fabric and pound of faux-flesh, won't end up in a traveling exhibit tie-in a la his “Pinocchio.”) What happens to a person who is made without love, and left still unloved after the fact? They become a monster, and del Toro, especially in a second chapter that tells the creature's story through his eyes, is willing to go deeper into his arc than most prior filmmakers.

 










The movie begins with an under-wraps Elordi ripping into the crew of an ice-wrecked Russian ship, smashing bodies invincibly while trying to get his maker, Victor, back in his clutches after being left to die. The story then moves backwards as we see how Victor was tasked by his sister-in-law's uncle (Christoph Waltz) to create super soldiers for battle using the scrap body parts of dead ones. And look how that turned out.

The Gothic Victorian Victor is installed in to carry out his mad genius will remind you of the decaying mansion in “Crimson Peak,” del Toro's twisted psychosexual ghost movie that brought to mind Robert Wise, Jack Clayton, and Val Lewton. That the majority of what you see in “Frankenstein” isn't AI- or computer-generated, del Toro's backdrops populated with living people behind and in front of the camera, is worth its own celebration. Despite all that stagecraft, you want to compel del Toro to go weirder, darker, rather than reverential, as his film promises to be the most faithful yet to Shelley's book. Which was weird, which was dark, and which has resisted cinematic reverence.

Waltz and Goth are fine, with Goth, who in earlier films possesses a mischievous, bubbly offbeatness similar to ‘70s Shelley Duvall but here just as well demonstrates her ability to shimmy into ethereal, period mode, seemingly falling for Frankenstein's monster at the drop of a wispy, gossamer veil. We're a little left on the branches as to how this encounter bloomed into a soul-shaking romance — as Elizabeth reveals, later, that she felt she never belonged to the decorous world of parties and corsets and curls and feathers on the head, a world that the monster could take her away from. Del Toro assumes some knowledge of the text so that we can tie these threads together ourselves, but the two romantic entanglements (Elizabeth and the monster, Elizabeth and Victor) don't get the fleshing-out and level of depth needed for us to accept them, fait accompli, oozing wounds and all.

 










Still, Elordi does that lifting, with an alternately melancholic and disarmed take on the monster. A scene in which he offers tenderness to a deer after a fiery escape, only for that animal to be unceremoniously gunned down by a hunter, summarizes the del Toro modus operandi: moments of beauty, brushes against sweetness, abruptly eviscerated by gruesome violence. The comingling of the sublime and the brutal, and often in the same shot, is what makes del Toro's work so fascinating, so distinctly signature-stamped that you would recognize them from space. Or the top of a Victorian garret, anyway. And at least one of these actors falls from one.

The young Australian actor Elordi has brandished brutality and tenderness before, whether in “Euphoria” as a sexually conflicted, self-loathing jock or Justin Kurzel's “The Narrow Road to the Deep North” as a traumatized World War II soldier reeling from an extramarital affair. Elordi has the risk-willingness of Marlon Brando, but the softness and vulnerability of pre-accident Montgomery Clift. So there's no surprise that he nails it once again as this disconcerted monster, a creation and victim of humanity's hubris. The performance feels something close to otherworldly, an unsure alien dropped from nowhere, but with a movement coach on the back-end for extra litheness, limberness, and tentative undulation. You have to recognize the alchemy between director and performer going on here, as the successes of either in “Frankenstein” would not happen without the other.

 










“Frankenstein” does play it a little safe in its dedication to the well. It doesn't leave you with the feeling that anything was creatively risked (other than, of course, the monumental task of putting together a massive film set with real crew hand-making the thing from top to toe, cinematographer Dan Laustsen and production designer Tamara Deverell among them). Or that del Toro ever hit his head on some kind of artistic ceiling. If you want your del Toro weirder, “Frankenstein” might not be your cup. But if you want a period monster movie that's solid, almost oaken in its sturdiness, you don't need to knock on wood to assure that del Toro is keeping the innermost essence, the soul of cinema, alive at least.

“Frankenstein” premiered at the 2025 Venice Film Festival. Netflix releases the film in theaters on Friday, October 17 before a streaming premiere on Friday, November 7.

Cradle of Filth singer Dani Filth issued a lengthy statement Friday addressing the abrupt exit of the band's guitarist and keyboardist, as well as their parting accusations of low pay, “unprofessional behavior,” and other “foolish clown antics.”


	Singer and keyboardist Zoë M. Federoff first announced her departure from Cradle of Filth for “personal reasons,” and days later the band announced they were firing “effective immediately” guitarist (and Federoff's husband) Marek “Ashok” Šmerda. The sudden splits soon turned acrimonious as both Federoff and Šmerda aired grievances against the band and the group's management.


	While Dani Filth touched on the situation when he announced Šmerda's firing, the singer gave a more detailed account of the rift in a long statement posted on social media Friday.


	“I think it's time to reveal my side of the story, now that so many accusations have been leveled at the band, our management, and me personally,” Filth wrote at the onset. “I apologize for the slight tardiness of this statement; it was important to approach this in a level-headed manner after reflection. The timing was also difficult, as the band is currently touring South America with arduous travel days, long flights, and shows.”

	In the statement, Filth addressed claims of a restrictive contract that band members must sign — “WE DO NOT prohibit our musicians from work commitments with other bands, we only ask to plan sufficiently,” he wrote — as well as the mudslinging aimed at the group's management. 

	











	“Of course Zoe would show you the worst and it saddens me that the context of what I thought was our dialogue was warped to fit an agenda and made public,” Filth wrote. “And yes, unfortunately a band is a business, and when we witness a person stirring trouble, drinking heavily, not writing, threatening to sue the band over use of their image, then something obviously needed to be done.”


	Filth also responded with some too-much-information claims of his own, shining a public light on Federoff and Šmerda's private relationship, citing “heavy drinking, escalating arguments, and repeated public disputes created a very disruptive atmosphere for everyone involved.”

	Filth also shared text messages where Šmerda made unflattering comparisons between the band's management and Sharon Osbourne. “Ashok spoke out for her and went after the Royal family of heavy metal and we won't have anybody speaking about Ozzy's wife like this,” Filth added.


	Despite all the drama, Cradle of Filth's tour of South America has continued on incident-free, with replacements quickly taking the place of the departed members. “Anyhoo I could prattle on forever, I just wanted to clear up a few things and then be out of your hair,” Filth added. ” Thank you to all the many bands, fans and fellow musicians who have proffered their support in this matter.”

When Hallmark Channel fans tune in for the network's newest rom-com on August 30, 2025, they'll get to see longtime fan-favorites Michael Rady and Emilie Ullerup unite onscreen for “Catch of the Day.” 

But they weren't the only stars involved in bringing the movie to life. The script was written by Food Network star Katie Lee Biegel, with help from NBC “Dateline” correspondent Andrea Canning, who often moonlights as a Hallmark screenwriter. 

Biegel, one of the stars of Food Network's long-running series “The Kitchen,” has written numerous best-selling cookbooks and the novel “Groundswell,” which became a 2022 Hallmark movie starring Lacey Chabert. 

That experience made Biegel curious about writing Hallmark movies, she told Swooon, so she set her sights on learning how to do it, starting with a screenwriting class at NYU. She said she also read a screenwriting book and “learned the ropes” by working with Canning. 

Screenwriters don't always get to be on-set to see their movies come to life, but Biegel makes a cameo in “Catch of the Day” playing “a food blogger that's maybe not always the nicest,” she told NY1's Spectrum News.

While filming, Biegel was fascinated watching her script come to life, she told Swooon, explaining, “I wrote the dialogue, but then to watch actors interpret it, and to maybe say it differently than I had thought it, and I really liked their take on it. It's just fun to see someone else's creative spin.” 

Surprisingly, Biegel told New York Live, “Even though I wrote the dialogue, it was challenging to memorize it and to go off of somebody else, and know when to say my lines … It was different, but it was so fun.” 

In “Catch of the Day,” according to Hallmark's synopsis, Ullerup plays Sophie — “a rising culinary star on the verge of becoming executive chef at a high-end Manhattan restaurant. But when her sister Abigail calls with news that their beloved family seafood spot in Montauk is floundering, Sophie returns home to help.”

In June, Hallmark Media VP of Development Laura Gaines told TV Insider, “This all started with Katie Lee's vision of exploring a woman who is pulled between two culinary worlds and ultimately falls in love with her family's legacy, leaving the fine dining world behind to reconnect to her roots.”

Biegel told TV Insider she's excited for Hallmark fans to see the “amazing chemistry” between Ullerup and Rady, who plays Sophie's old crush, Cam. 

“I think that people are going to watch it and feel that nostalgic feeling of summer love when you were young,” Biegel told the outlet. 

Biegel, who lives in the Hamptons, told Swooon that she was inspired by the many ways Montauk, a quaint Long Island town, has changed over the last two decades. 

“I spend a lot of time on the east end of Long Island, and I've been there over 20 years now, and I've really watched Montauk change,” she told the outlet. “It went from being this small, commercial fishing village, (that's) quiet to now the cool place where people are going and getting bottle service and dancing on tables.”

“It's changed quite a bit,” Biegel continued, “and I wanted to write about the challenges of small businesses, especially in tourist towns, and family dynamics within a family business. And, ultimately, love. I mean, this is Hallmark, and we love a love story.”

“Catch of the Day” premieres on August 30 at 8 pm. Eastern time.

In the post-pandemic wake of the USA legal drama Suits getting new life and attention on streaming, a bevy of TV networks have attempted to jump on the bandwagon. Just making a legal drama isn't enough, of course. What these networks are doing is crafting legal procedurals that manage to thread the needle between creating compelling case-of-the-week drama with a somewhat more lighthearted approach to its character-building. Netflix (where Suits found that resurgence of popularity) has adapted some of Michael Connelly's books into its version of The Lincoln Lawyer, which has been renewed for a fourth season. Prime Video hung its hook on another of Connelly's long-running characters, Los Angeles detective Harry Bosch, with its two separate Bosch shows, and NBC tried and recently failed to just make a straight-up Suits spin-off. But Suits LA got almost as much attention for how quickly it fizzled as for its very existence.

The USA Network, where Suits began during the days of the channel's old tagline “Characters Welcome,” has gone even a bit more old school than pulling from the works of legal writers like Connelly or Scott Turow. (The latter had his famous Presumed Innocent adapted into an Apple TV+ show, with the first season led by Jake Gyllenhaal and the second set to star Rachel Brosnahan. That and the aforementioned Lincoln Lawyer redo were overseen by '80s-era legal-TV icon David E. Kelley.) USA has largely changed its programming M.O.; at the moment, they have just one scripted TV series, and it premiered only two weeks ago. And yet, it feels like the network's attempt to creatively have its cake and eat it too. That show is a modernized adaptation of John Grisham's The Rainmaker, which has been performing its own balancing act between being a throwback to the laid-back USA procedurals of the mid-2000s and being darker and edgier like many other peak TV productions. Unfortunately, in trying to recapture lightning in a bottle, USA is only showing how difficult that can be. 

The essential conflict within this new take on Grisham's 1995 novel is between the haves and have-nots. The young hero is Rudy Baylor (Milo Callaghan), a hotshot young lawyer (in the mold of many of Grisham's protagonists) who has, along with his girlfriend Sarah (Madison Iseman), just started as a first-year associate at Tinley Britt, a well-to-do law firm with the tough-as-nails managing partner Leo Drummond (John Slattery). In fact, Drummond is so tough that when Rudy has the tenacity to push back on a faux pop quiz of legalese questions in front of a large group of freshmen associates, he's summarily dismissed. But he quickly gets back up on his feet and is hired by the fancy-sounding J. Lyman Stone and Associates, a firm run out of a defunct restaurant by Jocelyn Stone (Lana Parrilla) and her compatriot Deck Shifflet (P.J. Byrne). They are, in short, ambulance chasers, but young Rudy has enough of a good heart that he's compelled to take on a wrongful death suit levied by Dot (Karen Bryson), whose addict son died in the care of a major hospital. Conveniently, that hospital's legal representation is Tinley Britt, which leads to inevitable face-offs in court between Rudy's old and new employers.

The show, at least so far, is following the general outline of Grisham's novel, which means that there's an obvious way in which this series is unlike shows such as Suits or Burn Notice or Royal Pains. There's no case-of-the-week element but rather a single serialized case that will presumably encompass the entire season. You don't have to be familiar with Grisham's novel (or the 1997 film adaptation directed by Francis Ford Coppola and starring a pre-Good Will Hunting Matt Damon) to understand that Rudy is on the right side of justice in standing up for Dot and her dead son Donny Ray, who may have a checkered past but whose demise was clearly a lot more suspicious than initial report suggests. 

In some ways, the dichotomy that this show is trying to navigate is best exemplified by the supporting character Melvin Pritcher, who wasn't part of the book (or any of Grisham's novels). As played by Dan Fogler, Melvin is the first person we see, barely escaping a fire meant to destroy his small house that apparently kills his mother. In a different world, it would be easy to see Fogler playing Shifflet, a character as delightfully shady as his name suggests. (Byrne is clearly enjoying the chance to be the most outlandish of the lawyers in this series.) But Melvin Pritcher, who coincidentally works as a nurse at the same hospital where Donny Ray died, is inexplicably much more than meets the eye. He seems like a friendly, unassuming, if slightly awkward fellow until (spoiler alert) the first episode climaxes with him mercilessly killing an older woman for having inadvertently spied on him in the middle of some shady deeds. Melvin is a microcosm of what this show wants: to present itself as a natural creative descendant of shows like Suits, whose relaxed tones are what lend them a certain charm, but then to shock its audience out of procedural complacency with twists that badly want to be as edgy as something on HBO or Showtime. (So far, the sprinkling of profanity is the closest The Rainmaker gets to feeling truly mature.)

﻿

Part of the problem for The Rainmaker is less the attempt to be both episodic and more complex, to appeal to audiences who may not want to be terribly challenged while also compelling those looking for more grownup fare, and more the feeling that it's arrived too late to the party. Just as John Grisham's works have been catnip to Hollywood studios (more so in the 1990s), a few of his books have been turned into TV series, like The Client and The Firm. But while Grisham's novels managed to become mammoth successes initially for capturing readers' imaginations in crafting a modern take on the legal thriller, there are so many other options from which audiences can choose on TV now that a 30-years-later take on The Rainmaker feels almost quaint, no matter how hard the writers try to gussy things up. It's not that the structural changes to the story (like Rudy working for Tinley Britt before he shifts to Stone and Associates, or Stone now being a female character) are bad or feel misguided. It's that those very changes, along with the inclusion of a character like Melvin Pritcher, seem like creative concessions to move beyond the so-called “blue sky” style of storytelling that USA succeeded with before.

Netflix, aside from making old-school legal dramas, has co-opted the “blue sky” style, though largely by stepping beyond traditional criminal or law procedurals in favor of low-key and long-running romantic dramas like Virgin River. What the USA shows of old got right so quickly wasn't just the details of how criminal cases are settled in or out of the courtroom, or how ex-federal agents escape being burned; they correctly homed in on building likable characters who could be placed in any number of situations. The Rainmaker is boosted  far less by memorable characters and more by actors whose presences are welcome enough to almost make you forget they're elevating forgettable material. Through three episodes, it's the most well-known performers, like Slattery, Fogler, and Parrilla, who make the biggest impression simply for being more recognizable. Leo Drummond, for one, isn't terribly intriguing to watch as he schemes, but it's fun to see the former Roger Sterling dress down the next generation of actors. Their big, brassy performances are the most enjoyable aspect of the series, but it only proves that, on this show, actors, not characters, are welcome.

In hindsight, and considering the second life that Suits got on Netflix, you can't help but wonder why the USA Network ever moved on from the “Characters Welcome” ethos, as many of its old series have had TV-movie extensions (like Psych) or sequels or just the possibility of sequels. (USA earlier this year announced it was developing a sequel series to Royal Pains.) The vast amount of new TV isn't any less staggering, but there would be a welcome appeal to USA going back to its previous roots. On the surface, adapting one of the most famous of John Grisham's novels to start that return makes perfect sense. (And releasing a legal thriller in the dog days of summer is unquestionably a smart idea, hearkening to the notion of the good old-fashioned beach read.) But just as NBC realized earlier this year that the very existence of a new Suits show doesn't guarantee a win, USA may come to learn that dressing up a known story in a familiar genre doesn't automatically make its presence any more welcome.

					By Pete Hammond 

Awards Columnist/Chief Film Critic


	The 52nd Telluride Film Festival is barely more than a day old and already there is a strong theme running through the new films here: art as a life altering experience. In Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere, depression causes the superstar musician to go deep into his writing and recording a new album in order to find his true self. In Jay Kelly, George Clooney plays a mega movie star who takes a detour from his career in order to discover what has passed him by in his personal life. And now in Hamnet Chloé Zhao navigates how love and death collide at the intersection of William Shakespeare's greatest play.

	











	It's a powerful argument all around about how the human experiences can transform into art and storytelling , and it is front and center in these films, with Hamnet perhaps being the most vivid example of them all. Based on Maggie O'Farrell's award winning novel, it is a fictional idea -albeit one steeped in research – that the death of Will Shakespeare's 11 year old son, Hamlet directly metamorphisized into a key theme in his play Hamlet . Although there is little solid evidence of it by those who study this kind of thing, the timing indicates the writing and production of the play coincided with this dark moment in Shakespeare's life and became a way to channel his grief into his writing.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Zhao's film is first a love story, then one of family, then one of deep pain and conflict, and finally one of relief and hope. It tells the tale of Agnes (Jessie Buckley) , a free spirited lover of nature and wilderness with a wild child streak who basically is a bit of an outcast except by her farmer brother Bartholomew (Joe Alwyn), when one day Will Shakespeare (Paul Mescal) comes into her life and a passionate, somewhat forbidden affair commences, much to the objections of his stern parents, John (David Wilmot) and the very religious Mary (Emily Watson). Nevertheless they get married, have three kids, Susannah (Bohdi Rae Breathnatch), Judith (Olivia Lynes), and Hamnet (Jacobi Jupe). As the years pass Will finds himself frequently going away to London from their Stratford-On-Avon home in order to pursue his playwriting and producing dreams, while Agnes is left with the kids. Things really get tense when the plague intervenes and Judith gets gravely ill, an event where loving brother attempts to somehow transfer his own health to her to bring her back from the brink. However it happened she does respond but it is at the cost of his own life.

	











	This devastates the family, and no question absent father Will who is distraught when he arrives back to the house and finds his only son has died. Agnes lashes out at him for not being there when it counted, and the rift in their marriage has never been so clear. He throws himself back into his work, a new play Agnes had thought was a comedy but it turns out to be called “The Tragedy Of Hamlet” and it is anything but funny. The death of his son Hamlet ( a title card on the film explains the name Hamlet is another way of saying Hamlet) has directly affected the creation of this dark story with so much death at its center, and a ghostly presence that becomes its spiritual core. But can it bring Will and Agnes back to where they once were?


	What Zhao, who also co-wrote the screen adaptation with O'Farrell, has accomplished here is nothing short of emotionally devastating by the time it reaches the opening performance of the play with a still bereft Agnes front and center with her brother but expecting something entirely different than what Will has quietly transformed on to the stage at the Old Globe. What ensues becomes the film's undisputed highlight, a punch to the gut that will leave you shaken as well as in tears.


	Buckley, who can do no wrong, is sensational and the beating heart of the story as a young woman who ran free and marched to her own drummer, but who became a fiercely protective and devoted mother. Her life had been as much a marriage to nature as it was to Will, and the birth of their first child, Susannah, with Agnes alone in a deep hole outdoors is a memorable and stunning scene to say the least. Her fierce and unleashed emotional range is gut wrenching. Mescal is equally very fine as the world's most famous playwright, but this is a side of the Bard we have never seen and the actor brings deep unleashed power to his performance, especially in the staging of Hamlet. Jupe is a sunny presence as Hamlet, so charming and fun we miss him all the more after his tragic death. In a nifty bit of casting Jacobi's older acting brother Noah Jupe, now all grown up, is terrific in the title role of the Hamlet production.


	Technically the film is exceptional with stunning cinematography by Lukasz Zal, whether it is those candlelit interiors or wide outdoors. The production design from Fiona Crombie is right on, as is the subtle use of Max Richter's lilting score. 


	After winning Oscars for Nomadland, and then trying a big-budget Marvel movie to show her versatility, Hamnet, with its quiet determination to say much about how art is affected by life, is unlike anything else and proof she is just about as good a filmmaker as any working today. Hamnet, with its two stars and director achieving new heights of their talents, knocked me out.


	Producers are Liza Marshall, Pippa Harris, Nicolas Gonda, Sam Mendes and Steven Spielberg.

Glen Powell is getting a college football do-over in Hulu‘s upcoming comedy series Chad Powers.


	The actor debuted the trailer for the series on Saturday morning during ESPN's College GameDay. In it, he plays former Oregon hotshot Russ Holliday, who made an unforgivable mistake eight years ago that cost him his entire football career. 


	After making a massive play during a game, he showboats his way into the end zone, dropping the ball before he crosses the threshold and allowing Georgia to recover the ball and seal the win themselves. So, when he sees that South Georgia is hosting tryouts nearly a decade later, he decides to go back to college and fulfill his potential — only he'll have to go undercover as Chad Powers, an unsuspecting (read: very suspecting, given those prosthetics) college football player.

Lee Byung-hun, who starred in the Korean director's breakout hit ‘Joint Security Area' and more recently in ‘Squid Game,' plays a desperate man turned ruthless by unemployment.


							By 

	David Rooney


Chief Film Critic


	Think of No Other Choice (Eojjeol Suga Eopda) as something akin to Kind Hearts and Coronets that trades the Edwardian English aristocracy for the contemporary Korean industrial job market, and you'll have some idea of the tricky tonal balancing act it requires. Which makes it sad to report that Park Chan-wook stumbles on some jarring shifts. The movie remains the work of a master craftsman with his own idiosyncratic storytelling signature, though the pathos and suspense of a hardworking family man driven by desperation to murder get short-changed in favor of wacky humor.

	











	The second screen adaptation of Donald E. Westlake's novel The Ax — following Costa-Gavras' 2005 French version — is by no means without pleasures. Notable among them are its gorgeous visual crispness, crazy camera angles and exhilarating zooms; its two appealing leads; its amusing jabs at capitalism; and an inventive ending that is both a victory over the cruelty of corporate redundancies and a sobering acknowledgement of the grim prospects for humans in an automated workforce.

The Bottom Line

	
	Starts and finishes in fine form but loses itself midway.
	



Venue: Venice Film Festival (Competition)Cast: Lee Byung-hun, Son Ye-jin, Park Hee-soon, Lee Sung-min, Yeom Hye-ranDirector: Park Chan-wookScreenwriters: Park Chan-wook, Lee Kyoung-mi, Don McKellar, Jahye Lee, based on the Donald E. Westlake novel, The Ax

								2 hours 19 minutes			






	The director made his name in the early 2000s with instant cult hits like the operatically violent revenge fantasy Oldboy. But his intoxicating last two features, the sumptuous erotic period thriller The Handmaiden and the intricate neo-noir puzzle Decision to Leave, have seen his unerring control and painstaking attention to detail sharpened in elegant new ways. That makes the more wayward style of the new film a disappointment, particularly given that it's been a 20-year dream project for Park.

	











	Still, many of the director's admirers will embrace the broad comedy and slapstick antics, even if they lessen the stakes for a protagonist who's a thoroughly decent man until a crisis that threatens everything he has worked for transforms him into the clumsiest killer in homicide history. It's key to Park's handle on the material that the character retains much of his innocence, even after getting blood on his hands.


	Though he's now most widely known as the Front Man on Squid Game, Lee Byung-hun was one of the stars of the director's first hit, Joint Security Area. He's ideally cast here as Man-su, a paper mill manager with 25 years of company loyalty.


	The promising set-up is a birthday celebration for his wife Miri (Son Ye-jin, wonderful) in the garden out front of their odd-looking but picturesque house (quirky architecture is one of the movie's visual charms). Man-su gathers Miri, their teen son (Kim Woo-seung) and younger daughter (Choi so-yul) in a group hug under a sprinkling of cherry blossoms from the tree that spreads out above them while their two adorable golden retrievers — I mean seriously adorable — get in on the affection. It's almost comically idyllic, which is clearly intended when Man-su looks up and sighs with gratitude, “I have it all,” something no one has ever said in a movie without immediately losing it.


	In a cruel joke, he learns that the expensive eel on his barbecue sent by the mill's management is like a gold watch kiss-off, in this case marking involuntary retirement. He arrives at work and spreads the grim news among his team that the new American owners have indicated there will be job losses. One of them turns out to be Man-su's.

	











	Park mines poignancy and mordant humor from a support group for recently unemployed men, where they work on their emasculation issues and tell themselves in motivational exercises that their loving families will stand behind them while they seek new opportunities. But despite a pledge to himself to land a new job in his sector, he's stacking cartons at a big box store 13 months later.


	Miri is pragmatic at home, cutting down on expenses — no more Netflix for the kids or tennis lessons for Mom — and putting the house on the market, with plans to move them into an apartment. She informs her husband that with foreclosure only three months away, it's their only way to pay off their debts and stay afloat. She also returns part-time to her dental hygienist job at a practice where Man-su suspects the handsome dentist of having designs on her.


	What most lights a fire under Man-su is the thought of losing the childhood home he worked hard to buy back, a sanctuary standing on land that was once his father's pig farm, where he loves to potter around in his greenhouse.


	He gets a tip about a position that would be perfect for him — aside from working under cocky former subordinate Choi Sun-chul (Park Hee-soon) — at Moon Paper, one of the few companies in the sector doing well, since they cracked the Japanese market. The interview is a disaster, his disappointment later compounded when he returns, begging for work, and is humiliated by Choi.


	The instinct to want to bump off Choi and replace the obnoxious hotshot comes naturally, though it occurs to Man-su that in order to be guaranteed the job, he would have to eliminate any other unemployed men with the necessary qualifications.

	











	That comes down to just two. One is Gu Bummo (Lee Sung-min), who spends his days getting pickled in beer while his theater actress wife Ara (Yeom Hye-ran) rails at him for his pathetic surrender. She concedes that her husband is not to blame for losing his job, but his weakness in dealing with it earns her contempt. The other obstacle to Man-su being first in line at Moon Paper is Go Sijo (Cha Seung-won), a gentle-natured shoe salesman whose heart remains in the paper industry.


	Park's cartoonish humor notwithstanding, there's tenderness toward these men, who were invested in their jobs to such a degree that being kicked to the curb leaves them nullified, stripped of their identities.


	Reeling them in proves easy for Man-su, with a fake company website and promotional video helping him to weed out the serious candidates. Icing them proves harder for the inept wannabe killer, landing him in embarrassing situations with precarious stakeout positions, muddy ground to slip on and a deadly snake bite that brings an unexpected rescuer.


	Lee handles the physical comedy with endearing awkwardness and remains firmly planted in the middle-ground between self-preservation and murderous intent — he has “no other choice.” But the mid-section plotting gets a bit bonkers and the emphasis on laughs tends to neutralize the thriller aspect. The film gets back on track, however, with an outcome arrived at via some unpredictable swerves and decisive intervention from Miri to fix Man-su's bungled efforts.

	











	Park dedicates the film to Costa-Gavras, who held the rights to the novel and worked with the Korean director in the initial development stages, when it was planned as an English-language remake. Canadian actor-writer-director Don McKellar, likely a holdover from that earlier blueprint, is one of four credited screenwriters, which may also be a contributing factor to the herky-jerky tone.


	Whatever flaws there are in the execution, the fact remains that even a subpar Park Chan-wook film has more going for it than a lot of directors' best work. And those dogs!

Among the famous auteurs working today, there are a range of opinions on why one would want to make their film at Netflix, considering the lack of theatrical distribution that comes with working at the streaming service. But director Guillermo del Toro, who won an Oscar with Netflix for his take on “Pinocchio” offered a fresh angle on the matter during the press conference for “Frankenstein,” his latest Netflix film, premiering at the 82nd Venice Film Festival.

“To me, the battle we are going to find in telling stories is on two fronts. Obviously the size of the screen, but the size of the ideas is very important. The size of the ambition, the size of the artistic hunger that you bring to cinema,” said the Best Director winner. “It's a matter of, can we reclaim scale, and reclaim scale of ideas? Can we challenge ourselves to that?”

Del Toro has dreamed of making his own “Frankenstein” adaptation since he was a child, but “I always waited for the movie to be done in the right conditions both creatively and in terms of achieving the scope that it needed for me to make it different, to make it at a scale that you could reconstruct the whole world,” he said. Netflix was the studio that finally made that possible, with the film reportedly having a $120 million budget.

 










The director reminded the audience of festival press that there have been instances in the past where even a fully theatrical release of his did not go the way he envisioned. “You never know what's gonna happen. When we released ‘Nightmare Alley,' we were released next to ‘Spider Man [No Way Home]' and Omicron, the variation of COVID, and we lasted very little, so you never know which format it's going to be,” said the director.

At least with Netflix, “what I do know is to reach over 300 million viewers,” he said. “You take the opportunity and the challenge to make a movie that can transform itself variably, beautifully, and that evokes the cinema, and then you provide for theaters in the beginning and that makes for me a very creative experience.”

“Frankenstein”will receive a limited theatrical release on October 17, 2025, and a global release by Netflix on November 7, 2025.

On Thursday, the talk of Telluride was what the Friday patron screening would be. On Friday, we learned it was Paolo Sorrentino's Venice opener “La Grazia.” And at the annual Telluride brunch, the question circulating was: Which screening of Scott Cooper's “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere” would Bruce show up at? Friday or Saturday? (Both.)

The jampacked brunch up in the mountains brought many of the Labor Day weekend players together. When I introduced Paul Mescal (“The History of Sound” and “Hamnet”) to documentarian Morgan Neville (“Man on the Run”), they dove into a deep, enthusiastic conversation about their mutual fascination, Paul McCartney. Mescal is deep in rehearsals in London for the first of four Sam Mendes Beatles movies. He has visited McCartney's sheep farm in Scotland, where he decompressed after the Beatles breakup, and also visited his Cavendish manse. Neville is debuting his post-Beatles McCartney Wings movie. While Telluride director Julie Huntsinger wanted McCartney to attend, he was on tour. Mescal also greeted Harris Dickinson (the writer-director of “Urchin”), who plays Lennon, and Jeremy Allen White, who plays Springsteen.

Also on hand were Chloe Zhao, the director of the book adaptation “Hamnet,” starring Mescal and Jessie Buckley as Shakespeare and his wife, one of two films about grieving at the festival, along with “H is for Hawk,” starring Claire Foy, who plays the author Helen Macdonald in Philippa Lowthorpe's film version.

Rose Byrne is generating Oscar talk for her performance in “If I Had Legs I'd Kick You,” and Ethan Hawke is also building buzz for “Blue Moon,” directed by Richard Linklater, who was on hand with his “Nouvelle Vague” star Zoey Deutch.

Many Cannes films are on display at Telluride, including “Sentimental Value” (with Stellan Skarsgard) and “Pillion” (with Alexander Skarsgard) and Kleber Mendonça Filho's “Secret Agent,” starring Best Actor winner Wagner Maura.

The other first night screenings were “Hamnet” and Edward Berger's “Ballad of a Small Player,” starring Colin Farrell as a seedy gambler in Macau. Saturday brings two Venice arrivals, Yorgos Lanthimos' “Bugonia” starring Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons, and “Jay Kelly,” without George Clooney, who missed his press conference due to a sinus infection. In fact the Italian government delayed two private planes that were bringing the “Jay Kelly” entourage to Colorado. Huntsinger at her press conference after the brunch suspected foul play from the Venice festival, which doesn't like their talent to leave early to go to Telluride. (There is fierce competition among Telluride, Venice and Toronto.)

Huntsinger is obviously friendly with Sundance's Eugene Hernandez, Berlin's Tricia Tuttle, and Cannes' Thierry Fremaux, who were all on hand.

	“My mom was always a determined and dream-driven woman,” said Jacqie Rivera, daughter of the late Mexican singer, and CEO of Jenni Rivera Enterprises, who will receive the award. “College was an important part of her beginnings — a place where she believed anything was possible. Receiving this recognition in her honor is a reminder that her story continues to inspire many to keep pursuing their dreams, no matter where they come from.”


	LBCC Superintendent-President Dr. Mike Muñoz added: “Jenni's music, her courage, and her unyielding voice for women and the Latinx community continue to inspire generations. She showed us what it means to rise above challenges, to stay true to our roots, and to use success as a platform to uplift others.”


	It was this exact week when the world (or at least his 3.6 million followers on Instagram) found out that Marco Antonio Solís is a Backstreet Boys fan. The Mexican singer-songwriter, who boasts 11 No. 1s on the Hot Latin Songs chart, attended the BSB residency at The Sphere in Las Vegas, and documented his entire experience, from enjoying the concert and singing the songs to meeting Nick, Howie, Kevin, A.J., and Brian, backstage. “Before starting my concerts this September 14th & 15th at Caesars Palace at The Colosseum Las Vegas we took this little getaway as a couple,” Solís shared, alongside a photo with his wife Cristy Solís.

	“These albums not only marked an era for my fans, but they also shaped my life completely,” she said in a press statement. “Through these songs, I was able to connect with audiences around the world, in Spanish and with our Latin rhythms. It is a privilege to celebrate this music decades after its release, and it inspires me to keep creating from love and respect for this wonderful profession.”

	On August 25, 2005, Donald Trump announced plans to build a 70-story high-rise in downtown New Orleans, which he referred to as a “sexy city.” Four days later, Hurricane Katrina hit. Trump and his family continued to pledge their commitment to the Trump Tower complex, saying they'd help the people of New Orleans rebuild their city, but the project never came to fruition. Twenty years later, the land it was supposed to stand on is still a parking lot.


	“It's going to be absolutely the most incredible building New Orleans has ever seen,” Trump said at the announcement. The building would have been the tallest in Louisiana and would have drastically changed the New Orleans skyline, in a city with very few tall buildings. Led by a group of Florida developers who did a licensing deal with Trump, the project was supposed to house a condominium-hotel, and include a five-star restaurant and retail space. 


	After Katrina, the developers lobbied Congress to include incentives that would help the tower be built more quickly, encouraging tax benefits to buyers of the condos and allowing public interest bonds to be sold to help cover material costs. A Times-Picayune article in November 2005 was headlined: “Tower could power New Orleans revival.”

	











	“The Trump organization stands behind the people of New Orleans as they rebuild their great city,” Trump said in a statement to the newspaper. “We have no doubt that the city of New Orleans will come back stronger than ever, and the Trump Organization is proud to be a part of this redevelopment process as New Orleans gets back on its feet. Our decision to enter the New Orleans market has only been reinforced by the dynamic nature and resilient strength of the people of New Orleans.”

	











	Years later, during a 2010 deposition about a different project, Trump said that immediately following Katrina, he actually offered the Florida developers their money back to get out of the project, but they turned him down.

	In 2007, the developers announced they had leased offices for the Trump Tower building. In January 2008, Donald Trump Jr. visited New Orleans to talk about the project and said the Trump Organization was planning a national push to look for buyers. Weeks later, they started advertising in the newspaper for employees. In the fall, the developers said the project was still going forward despite a sharp increase in construction prices after Katrina, but that they wouldn't start building until they sell half the units. Prices for the condos would start at $400,000 and go up to $2 million.


	A website for the project featured an introductory video with Don Jr. and Ivanka wearing masquerade masks that dissolved off their faces as their signatures and “Live Luxury” and “Live Opulence” flashed across the screen. It ended with a photograph of Donald Trump in a mask and the words “Live It Yourself.” A landing page for the site had a rendering of the 1.6 million-square-foot tower with the words: “In a city of limitless possibilities, lavish luxury towers from the ground up. One cannot aspire any higher. Even the sky is not the limit.”


	Letters from citizens about the tower flooded the Times-Picayune, with people writing in both support and against the building. “The news of the Trump Tower groundbreaking is unconscionable,” wrote one person, Jody, in the spring of 2007. “Citizens are still homeless, jobless, without sufficient police and fire protection and without adequate levees.”


	Others defended the project. “As we struggle to rebuild and redefine our future, surely Mr. Trump's project can only be considered a win-win for all concerned,” wrote a woman named Gail.

	“Revenue from this economic development can help us rebuild levees and increase citizen protection in case of another hurricane,” said a man named Andrew. “It is clear that the Trump tower could hold the key to reclaiming New Orleans' glory.”


	For years, a photograph of the proposed building was on a giant poster at the Poydras Street parking lot where it would supposedly be built. The poster faded with age and in 2011, the parking lot was sold at a foreclosure auction. 

	











	Five years later, when Trump was running for president against Hillary Clinton, the Democratic National Convention tried to use his failed attempt against him. A DNC researcher filed a public records request seeking documents about Trump and the scrapped project, but the city said none existed.


	“Donald Trump has threatened to do to the economy what he's done with his businesses, so we believe the American people have the right to see what happened in his various business ventures,” a DNC spokesperson told the Times-Picayune in 2016. “Across the country, he has outsourced instead of making American products, shortchanged small businesses and laid off workers. America deserves better.”


	Over the decades of his work as a real estate mogul, Trump developed a less-than-sterling reputation for how he conducted business. He was often accused of fraud, which his political opponents have tried to use against him. Marco Rubio, now Trump's Secretary of State, called him out in 2016 for leaving “a number of Floridians high and dry” after tapping out of a project in Fort Lauderdale. Similar to the New Orleans project, Trump had licensed his name to the deal, but the way the project was marketed left buyers believing Trump himself was developing the project. One New Orleans citizen that wrote into the Times-Picayune celebrated Trump investing “a portion of his personal fortune into building Trump tower in New Orleans,” although, in fact, Trump was paid $2 million upfront to license his name. 


	A similar failed tower and licensing deal happened in Tampa Bay and buyers were left distraught after sinking hundreds of thousands of dollars into something they believed to be managed by Trump himself. “The main reason we went into this was Trump,” said Jay McLaughlin, a physical therapist from Connecticut. “We had no idea he was just putting his name on it and not backing it financially.”


	A 2016 analysis by The New York Times found that a third of the business ventures hyped up by Trump from 2006-2016 never got off the ground. But Trump would sometimes describe them as successes for his company since he got paid money upfront for the licensing deals.


	The White House and Donald Trump Jr. did not return Rolling Stone's requests for comment on the failed New Orleans project. President Trump did not publicly acknowledge the 20th anniversary of Katrina making landfall on Friday.


	Katrina's anniversary has renewed scrutiny of Trump gutting the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) since retaking the White House. After Hurricane Katrina decimated Louisiana, FEMA was overhauled and given more funding for disaster preparedness. Communities of color are often the most vulnerable communities when natural disasters strike, which was the case with the communities devastated by Katrina. These communities are the same ones that stand to be most disproportionately affected by the dismantling of FEMA.

	Trump's cuts to the agency threaten to change how effective it would be in response to natural disasters, and in a letter to Congress on Monday, nearly 200 current and former FEMA employees sounded the alarm that the Trump administration had undercut FEMA's ability to respond to disasters like Katrina.


	The day after the letter was published, multiple FEMA employees were put on administrative leave.

The ‘Frankenstein' press conference at the Venice Film Festival found Waltz speaking only six words, leaving Guillermo del Toro and stars Oscar Isaac, Jacob Elordi, Mia Goth and more to pick up the slack.


							By 

	Chris Gardner



Guillermo del Toro has long resume that proves he prefers practical effects and physical craftsmanship over computer generated tools and AI. That filmmaking philosophy extends to his latest film, Frankenstein, and it went over quite well with his actors, especially Christoph Waltz.


	“CGI is for losers,” the veteran actor declared this afternoon during Frankenstein's official Venice Film Festival press conference. Waltz was short on words today but made quite an impression — and generated plenty of laughter — as he only spoke twice during the session. First with the aforementioned dig and later, he was asked how he remains hopeful in today's monstrous times. “I don't,” he said. And that was that.

	Fortunately, for those seeking longer quotes, del Toro and one of his stars, Oscar Isaac, had more to say on the subjects, particularly about the use of effects and the craftsmanship that goes into set building.

	“I say, ‘Let's construct the wardrobe and tailor the sets, and then give them to the actors,' because sets are wardrobes and wardrobes are sets. Acting is everything. If you tell an actor, ‘look at a ball on a green screen,' or you put them in a real lab with real windows and real light with real giant batteries, they are reacting to another actor. I always say there is a difference between eye candy, which is pretty, and eye protein, which is telling the story.” 

	











	Del Toro's Frankenstein, which he directed from his own screenplay, centers on Victor Frankenstein, played by Isaac, a brilliant but egotistical scientist who brings a creature (Jacob Elordi) to life in a monstrous experiment that ultimately leads to the undoing of both the creator and his tragic creation.


	Isaac said it's not only that del Toro builds out so much of his sets, it's the thoughtfulness that goes into construction and production design. “There's so much symbolism in the way that it's constructed, where the circles are placed, the archetypal nature of like, for instance, when Victor is in his father's room again, many years later, everything's oversized, as if he's a child again. To have that actually be the experience. It feeds so much more meaning into the performances as well,” he explained. 


	To be clear, though, del Toro added that he's not against CGI or other filmmaking tools — he employs many of them — but he prefers to grab them from the kit in the right way. “As a filmmaker, there's no bad resource. There's only badly used resources. We have digital effects, but you only do it when the limit of the physical has been not an easy solution. The more experience you have with the tools, the more you know how to do finer work with them.”


Frankenstein premieres tonight, Aug. 30, inside Sala Grande followed by a limited theatrical release on Oct. 17, and a global bow by Netflix on Nov. 7.

Guillermo del Toro‘s adaptation of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein launches at the Venice Film Festival today and the filmmaker, cast and backers Netflix were at the film's Lido press conference.


	Oscar Isaac stars as Dr. Victor Frankenstein, the brilliant but egotistical scientist who brings a creature (Jacob Elordi) to life in a monstrous experiment that ultimately leads to the undoing of both the creator and his tragic creation.


	Oscar winner Del Toro was asked by a journalist — sitting a row back from Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos — whether he would have liked more than a three-week theatrical run for his big-budget spectacle?

	Del Toro quipped initially: “Yeah. I mean, look, look at my size. I always want more of everything,” before adding of the $120M movie: “To me, the battle we are going to fight in telling stories is on two fronts, obviously the size of the screen, but the size of the ideas is very important. The size of the ambition. Can we reclaim scale, and reclaim scale of ideas. It's a dialogue, and it's a very fluid dialogue. I'm very happy. You never know what's going to happen….To reach more than 300 million viewers, you take the opportunity and the challenge to make a movie that can transform itself and that evokes cinema.”

	Del Toro said of his inspiration for making the movie: “It was a religion for me. Since I was a kid — I was raised very Catholic — I never quite understood the saints. And then when I saw Boris Karloff on the screen, I understood what a saint or a messiah looked like. So I've been following the creature since I was a kid, and I always waited for the movie to be done in the right conditions, both creatively in terms of achieving the scope that it needed for me to make it different, to make it at a scale that you could reconstruct the whole world.”


	Del Toro was asked about the danger AI and technology poses to humanity: “We live in a time of terror and intimidation, certainly. And the answer, which art is part of, is love. For me, forgiveness is part of love and so many other things. And the central question in the novel from the beginning is, what is it to be human? What makes us human? And there's no more urgent task than to remain human in a time where everything is pushing towards bipolar understanding of our humanity…I think that the movie tries to show imperfect characters and the right we have to remain imperfect, and the right we have to understand each other under the most oppressive of circumstances. It is very biographical to me, but it is, I think, biographical for anyone that tries to preserve their soul in the times we're living in. And to me, artificial intelligence I'm not afraid of; I'm afraid of natural stupidity, which is much more abundant.”

	











	Oscar Isaac described the journey he had been on since meeting Del Toro about the part two years prior: “I can't believe that I'm here right now. I can't believe we got to this place from two years ago, sitting at your table [looking at Del Toro] eating Cuban pork; just talking about our fathers and our life too…It was like a fusion. I just hooked myself into Guillermo, and we flung ourselves down the well.”


	Elordi said he poured his whole being into the role of the monster: “It was a vessel that I could put every part of myself into. From the moment that I was born to being here with you today, all of it is, is in that character. And in so many ways, the the creature that's on screen in this movie is the sort of purest form of myself. He's more me than than I am.”


	At Netflix's Tudum event earlier this year, Del Toro called the film “the culmination of a journey that has occupied most of my life,” adding, “Monsters have become my personal belief system. There are strands of Frankenstein through my films.”


	Coming off his third Oscar win for Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio, another literary adaptation for Netflix, Del Toro's Frankenstein also stars Mia Goth (X), Felix Kammerer (All Quiet on the Western Front), Lars Mikkelsen (The Witcher), David Bradley (Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio), Christian Convery (Sweet Tooth), Charles Dance (Game of Thrones) and Christoph Waltz (Inglourious Basterds).


	Del Toro directed from his own script and produced alongside J. Miles Dale and Scott Stuber.

	Last Saturday, Abed “Abe” Ibrahim reached a breaking point. The fledgling restaurateur, who fully embraces the current trend of frying foods in beef tallow rather than the seed oils commonly used throughout popular eateries, even naming his food stall “Tallow” for good measure, took to X and bemoaned how poorly the business was faring more than half a year after its grand opening in February.


	“For the last 7 months, I've been doing all that I can to make this restaurant successful,” Ibrahim wrote. “Maybe our food isn't good, but we bring in around $50-$125 per day being open for 7-8 hours. It's unsustainable and I have my first child on the way.” He continued the thread, writing in several more posts that he had invested “every penny” into the idea and thought customers would appreciate food made without “seed oils, high fructose corn syrup, fillers, preservatives and more,” while “still being affordable by today's standards.”


	Instead of an outpouring of sympathy, Ibrahim was met with hostility, ridicule, and contempt from X users who took the thread viral as they roasted his unsuccessful restaurant. “People are trying to get me kicked out of the building that I'm currently in, they're telling me they wish I'd die and that they can't wait to parade when my business fails,” Ibrahim, 28, tells Rolling Stone. “I have no hate towards them. My goal is to turn them into customers.”

	Why such a vicious reaction? Because the tallow fad is one of the more unexpected fronts in the American culture war. It's heavily promoted by right-wing and alternative health influencers who have spread misinformation about the harms of seed oils, not to mention Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump‘s anti-vax health secretary, who has made the return to tallow, or rendered beef fat, a pillar of his “Make America Healthy Again” campaign. Kennedy dubiously claims that people are “being unknowingly poisoned” by seed oils such as sunflower, corn, and canola oil, and that the saturated fats restaurants ditched in decades past because they contribute to heart disease and other illnesses are, contrary to the evidence, much better for you.

	As a result, the online commentariat was swift to assume that Ibrahim's Tallow restaurant was based on pseudoscience and representative of the “anti-woke” strain of MAGA contrarianism that rejects the liberal consensus on everything from gender to climate change and, of course, nutrition. 


	Critics on X mocked Ibrahim for operating his food stand within a ShopRite supermarket on the outskirts of suburban Philadelphia, noted his somewhat erratic hours of operation (closed on Sunday, shuttering early at 6:00 p.m. on Friday and Saturday), expressed bafflement that he didn't serve expected standard items like hamburgers, and pointed out that his website lacked basic information about the restaurant. When Ibrahim linked to his Bitcoin wallet at the suggestion of those who wanted to donate cryptocurrency to keep Tallow afloat, detractors further accused him of begging for a handout to prop up a failing and foolish venture. In the end, Ibrahim deleted the thread, fearing that the backlash would harm his landlord, ShopRite.

	Ibrahim is baffled by the polarizing politics now attached to tallow. “I think it's very stupid,” he says. “People are messaging my parents and loved ones saying they want to kill me and my family. All because of what? That I cook in tallow and avoid things like high fructose corn syrup? It is the biggest waste of time.” He adds, “We have much bigger problems in America and all over the world.” Ibrahim further clarifies that he is not a Trump voter, nor was he a fan of the Biden administration. “When it comes to MAHA,” he says, “I don't necessarily follow it. I recognize that some of what RFK Jr. says is true and some of the stuff he says is false.” Ibrahim cites Kennedy's alleged use of the dye methylene blue as a health supplement, saying he doesn't believe it's a “miracle serum.” As far as the Trump regime's overall approach to public health, Ibrahim says it is “almost as bad as the last administration,” with officials prioritizing opinions over facts. “The reason I say ‘almost' is because at least this administration is actually doing something about artificial colors and maybe high fructose corn syrup,” he adds.

	For Ibrahim, the tallow concept is personal, not a left or right issue. Growing up in a small town in Illinois, he says, he was always self-conscious about being overweight and eventually began studying nutrition as a hobby around 2016. He soon came to the conclusion that he had to cut out seed oils, artificial colorings, and anything else “that wasn't a natural ingredient.” He got into cooking in order to maintain his new diet, finding that he “was less sluggish, had more energy, and lost weight” as he stuck to it. (He notes, too, that “the flavor that comes out of [tallow] products are amazing.”) 

	











	After he was laid off from his job as a stockbroker in 2022, Ibrahim knew he wanted to make a career change, and he founded Permissibles, a natural ingredients frozen meals company that sells tallow as well. He was offered the kitchen space in ShopRite in 2024, when he pitched the store about getting his products on shelves, but initially passed on the opportunity before taking them up on it this year. Rather than paying a set amount to lease his stall, he pays a percentage of gross income that he declined to disclose. Ibrahim calls the ShopRight management “amazing,” saying they “truly care about others.” Apart from his wife, an emergency room nurse who occasionally helps out on her days off, Ibrahim is the sole employee. He estimates that roughly 75 percent of his business comes from regulars, many coming two or three times a week, with one customer who shows up nearly every day. The real challenge, Ibrahim says, has been attracting a broader clientele.


	In that sense, the social media dogpile was actually a net win. Ibrahim received around $8,000 in donations from those who believe in his mission, which he believes would be enough to keep Tallow open for another six months or so at the present rate of sales. And foot traffic, at least for the moment, is definitely up. “It's been good so far, but the important thing is that it continues to grow when this all dies down,” Ibrahim says. “The numbers we're seeing now don't matter too much. The long term is what matters.” He is also working to revamp his website — which “sucks,” he acknowledges — with assistance from new acquaintances who reached out to him on X.

	But, while Ibrahim would prefer to think of tallow cooking as apolitical, it's clear that many of his new supporters skew far-right and consider the elimination of seed oils part of a conservative project. One recent visitor, for example, has a Pepe the Frog avatar on X and routinely posts anti-immigrant and transphobic content. American life in 2025 seems to be largely governed by these quirks of ideological alignment, so that you can't even sell chicken wings fried a certain way without effectively signaling a connection to some partisan movement. Though in the perilous restaurant game, you have to take whichever customers come your way. And even if Tallow does shut down after this welcome attention dies away, Ibrahim believes in it too much to quit.  


	“I'd do what I can to reopen it,” he says. “I have no interest in doing anything else.”

	If there's one college football game to catch for the season's opening weekend, it's got to be Texas vs. Ohio State. Quarterback Arch Manning and the No. 1 Longhorns head to Ohio Stadium in Columbus today for the weekend's must-watch competition. The NCAAF opener sees the No. 3 Buckeyes in their first game of the season since becoming national champions earlier this year against Notre Dame. 




	“I think it is great for college football, great for our fans, great for our team. Again, no expectations other than to win. It is going to be a great environment, like I mentioned before. The louder we can make it, the harder we can make it for Texas, the better for us,” Ryan Day, Ohio State's head coach, told reporters earlier this week. 


	“We need the crowd into it,” Day continued. “Execution fuels emotion. I talk to the guys about that all the time, so the more execution we have, the more big plays that we make, the more the crowd will get into it. It is a great way to start the year. It's just different. There's positives and negatives to everything, but what a great game to kick off the season with against a great opponent. This is why you come to Ohio State. You come to Ohio State to play in games like this.”

	With the Buckeyes returning to the field as national champs, their season opener against the Texas Longhorns is still expected to be an extremely close game. “The perception is that Texas is just more experienced than Ohio State,” Ed Salmons, Westgate SuperBook oddsmaker, told ESPN earlier this week. “Arch Manning is considered a much better quarterback than the Ohio State quarterback [Julian Sayin]. Both are such unknowns, no one really knows.”

Riz Ahmed revealed he was hospitalized for an “intense” and “prolonged” illness amid filming for Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, the reality of which eventually led him to connect with the script for 2019's Sound of Metal.


	“Around the time of taking on Sound of Metal, I had had a very intense kind of health-related experience myself, where I had to grapple with the grief but also the acceptance around that,” he said in a new interview on Penn Badgley's co-hosted Podcrushed podcast. “And basically, I was in the middle of filming Star Wars, and my body just kind of, like, gave up on me. I was extremely exhausted, I was hospitalized for a brief period. I had to really try to recreate my strength. It was like building myself up from scratch. It was super scary and intense and quite prolonged, actually.”

	Noting that he wasn't “getting better quickly” after the onset of the “sudden” illness, he said, “And for a minute, I was like, ‘Am I ever going to get my life back?' It really wasn't clear.” He described the dueling experience as a “deep kind of grief and fear and terror and, yet, also a kind of tremendous liberation and gratitude and acceptance.”

	The Emmy and Oscar winner explained, “I always think that when you're brought to your knees, you're halfway towards praying. When you're kind of humbled in that way, when something is taken away from you, you become even more acutely aware of everything you have — and on a bodily level, on a health level, you realize, like, you don't control anything, man. You don't control a single thing. You don't even control your body.” 


	As a result, he said in a moment of “trippy clarity and in the darkness,” he realized “everything you have is a gift.” He continued, “In the most strange way, I never felt more grateful, more at peace, more content than when I felt like I was going to lose my whole life.”


	Inadvertently, Ahmed's health issues resulted in him resonating with the screenplay for Sound of Metal, for which he received an Academy Award nomination for portraying a drummer grappling with the reality of losing his hearing. “When I read the script, I was like, ‘I know what this is, you know, and I need to tell this story,'” Ahmed said. “I need to tell this story for me. I need to make sense of this. And I think that's one of the greatest privileges that we get as storytellers … the story you need finds you at the right time.”

	











The Night Of alum can currently be seen in Relay, opposite Lily James, which is currently playing in theaters. The actor is currently at the Telluride Film Festival for Hamlet, a modern reimagining of the seminal William Shakespeare play set in London, which will have its world premiere tomorrow.

Glad he put the bear death experience in words.  So true.  Glad he is okay.

No wonder he killed it in Sound of Metal, he wasn't acting, he was recreating the hell he really went through. Good stuff! Awesome actor. Always enjoy his films.

“Deliver Me from Nowhere” — that's what we're calling it — is a semi-desolate sketch of a biopic about a depressed 32-year-old man who channel surfs across a much better movie on TV one night in the fall of 1981. The man is Bruce Springsteen (a possessed Jeremy Allen White), the movie is Terrence Malick's “Badlands,” and its story of a Korean War vet who takes his 15-year-old girlfriend on a killing spree across the American heartland gives the wayward rock god a newfound sense of direction that just might save his life.

 










Adapted from Warren Zanes' book of the same name, and directed by Scott Cooper (“Out of the Furnace”) with all of his usual self-seriousness, the chilly but tender “Deliver Me from Nowhere” begins with Bruce returning to Freehold after a triumphant year on tour with the E Street Band. He's on the cusp of the megastardom he would claim soon thereafter, but even closer to the brink of a nervous breakdown.

The reality of his imminent success has left Bruce feeling like a stranger in the only home he's ever known, while the open highway that stretches west into the future — an axiomatic symbol of freedom in earlier songs like “Thunder Road” and “Born to Run” — has suddenly come to seem like the surest path towards self-annihilation. Haunted by unresolved childhood trauma and suffering from a depression that he knows how to sing about but lacks the words to diagnose, Bruce is (vaguely) tormented by the vertigo of feeling more lost than ever at the same time as he's fulfilling his destiny. 

 










In the ballad of Charles Starkweather and Caril Ann Fugate (whose names were changed for the purposes of Malick's film), Bruce sees his own disconnection staring back at him so clearly that his TV set might as well be a mirror. That recognition is the engine Bruce needs to jumpstart a new burst of creative self-discovery. It compels him to write an album that confronts the empty promise of deliverance head-on, and in doing so create a vehicle powerful enough to leave his demons in the rearview. 

At its core, “Deliver Me from Nowhere” is a small and brittle film about how difficult it is to move forward when something is holding you back. It's a film about a guy who's strapped to a rocket that's about to ignite, only to find that an anchor the size of New Jersey has been wrapped around his ankles; a guy who's gonna rip in half right down the middle if he doesn't find a way to shake off that weight before he ignites. That description might imply a certain urgency, but Cooper's taciturn script is largely content to move with the speed and ambivalence of self-discovery. “I know who you are,” someone tells Bruce in the parking lot after his regular show at The Stone Pony. “That makes one of us,” he replies. 

 










Just as “A Complete Unknown” told the story of Dylan going electric, the richer but less inviting “Deliver Me from Nowhere” could be said to tell the story of Springsteen going folk. And yet — for all of the tedious biopic tropes that Cooper finds a way to force into his otherwise withdrawn character study — that comparison would mischaracterize a movie whose subject hardly goes anywhere at all. 

Straining to bridge the inestimable gap between “Bohemian Rhapsody” and Gus Van Sant's “Last Days,” Cooper's film is at its best during the frequent stretches when it finds Bruce staring at the walls of his isolated rental home in Colts Neck. Reading Flannery O'Connor. Listening to Suicide. Maybe even thinking about committing it. It's hard to say how deep Bruce's anguish goes, because — to Cooper's credit — this movie doesn't tell us in any explicit terms. On the contrary, it rightly trusts that White's performance will convey Bruce's inner turmoil without putting too fine a point on it or making it more legible than it really was to any of the people who knew him (or to himself, for that matter). 

Head cocked and shoulders hunched like an invisible snake is wrapped around his windpipe, White is less interested in mimicry than evocation, and he manages to creates such an ineffably convincing Springsteen because he allows himself to seem like a fraud. While the Boss' persona has long relied on his ability to represent freedom and burden all at once, “Deliver Me from Nowhere” introduces us to Bruce at a moment before he's learned how to reconcile the two, and so White plays him with the honesty of a man who always feels like he's been caught in a lie. 

 










He doesn't look a ton like Springsteen (though popped collars and black leather jackets help sell the illusion), and his ability to sing just like him is sorely underused in a movie that defaults to the actual recordings whenever it can, but his performance is steeped in a truth so natural and unforced that by the end of the film you almost forget that he's playing someone else. In White's hands — and with a key assist from the eminently believable Odessa Young, who plays a Debbie Harry-styled composite of all the girlfriends who Bruce couldn't give himself to at the time — the film's searching lack of focus becomes more of a feature than a bug.

If only the rest of Cooper's biopic were so confident in letting Bruce's emotions speak for themselves; if only it shared Bruce's conviction that the spare recordings he and guitar tech Mike Batlan (a warm and fuzzy Paul Walter Hauser) committed to a four-track TEAC 144 in a Colts Neck rental house should exist separately from the arena-sized anthems he was laying down with The E Street Band in the studio. The not-so-great irony of “Deliver Me from Nowhere” is that the movie teeters closest to “Walk Hard”-like tripe whenever it focuses on the Herculean effort required to preserve the rawness of those recordings as they were transferred to tape, as well the concurrent effort to convince the suits at Columbia that “Nebraska” wouldn't be a career-killer.

 










The problem is neatly embodied by the outsized role of Bruce's lifelong manager-producer, played here by a clenched but schmoozy Jeremy Strong in a performance that makes Jon Landau sound like Roy Cohn's more benevolent younger brother. It's not that Strong is miscast, it's that he exists in a different movie altogether — one that has nothing to do with the pain of Bruce's songwriting and everything to do with the crazy story of trying to sell it. 

Cooper mercifully cut the groan-worthy trailer bit where Landau tells another record exec about how Springsteen has to repair himself with “Nebraska” so that he can “repair the entire world” after that, but scene after scene remains in which Landau is forced to smooth over the fact that his star client is going acoustic and singing about serial killers. No singles!? No interviews!? No tour!?!?. First he has to convince David Krumholtz, then he has to get chewed out on the phone by the real Jimmy Iovine, then he has to go home to his wife and kids with a dazed look on his face. 

There's no denying that Landau was essential to the release of Springsteen's most radical album, but “Deliver Me from Nowhere” never justifies why he should be the only character to exist independently from Bruce's point-of-view. Is watching one of the most legendary musicians in modern history churn his deepest pain into masterpieces like “Atlantic City” really so unremarkable that Cooper needed to forfeit roughly 30% of this movie to a glorified hypeman whose only job is to sell us on how historic it was?

 










Well, yes and no. The other regard in which “Deliver Me from Nowhere” strikes an unhelpful compromise between hardscrabble portrait and hacktastic biopic has to do with how it dramatizes the source of Bruce's aforementioned pain: Ultra-broad, black-and-white flashbacks in which a young Springsteen becomes an outlet for all of the anger and resentment that drove his dad to drink. 

Stephen Graham is a wonderful actor, and I have no doubt that he's an excellent parent as well, but you just know it's bad news when he shows up as someone's father in a biopic. Indeed, the mere fact of his casting is so evocative that it negates the need for many of his actual scenes, the majority of which are reductive and indistinct visions of domestic abuse. Only the last of them, which takes place in the film's present day, manages to reveal anything that we couldn't glean from the shots of an adult Bruce staring at the home where he grew up. 

Rather than embrace the raw humanity of Bruce's characterization and celebrate its refusal to adhere to some prefab emotional arc, “Deliver Me from Nowhere” seems convinced that it has to atone for its sparseness with an equal amount of auto-tuned noise — that it has to compensate for the fact that it ends with Bruce in therapy instead of on top of the world. Cooper's film wants to be the “Nebraska” of rock biopics, but it lacks the finesse to retain the essence of that sound when transferring it into the body of a commercial biopic. In that sense at least, it all too perfectly articulates how difficult it can be too move forward when something is holding you back. 

 










“Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere” premiered at the 2025 Telluride Film Festival. Searchlight Pictures will release it in theaters on Friday, October 24.

					By Pete Hammond 

Awards Columnist/Chief Film Critic


	It's always interesting seeing movies explore the creative process, such as what Steven Spielberg did recently in The Fabelmans, or larger-scale enterprises like the Oscar-winning Amadeus. But Mozart wasn't around to give his OK to that particular film. Bruce Springsteen, however, after turning down numerous past attempts and offers, is around to pass judgment on director-writer Scott Cooper‘s anti-biopic Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere, which prefers to focus on the man, in a key moment of his life and career creating his sixth studio album Nebraska, as he resisted all commercial temptation to to find himself, and the truth, in his art.

	











	It would seem for a major star, who six years earlier had appeared simultaneously on the covers of Time and Newsweek and had just come off a wildly successful release and tour for his fifth album The River, a bit of a risk. But as this exceptional film shows, it wasn't a risk to Springsteen: it was a necessity. In this way, Cooper has defiantly not made a so-called biopic, but rather contributed a snapshot in time and a portrait of what drives the creative process — no easy feat even as it has been attempted many times in Hollywood films (some good, some legendarily dishonest). The film had its World Premiere today at the Telluride Film Festival. This one, the first major narrative movie about Springsteen, plays it on its own terms and its own truths, just like The Boss himself did in creating the most unique album of his career in 1981 when, despite appearances, the walls were tumbling down. If some fans go in expecting the equivalent of a greatest hits package, think again. Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere is the real deal, an intelligent, deliberately paced journey into the soul of an artist. Intriguingly, it has something in common with another film that is playing at Telluride this weekend (and debuted earlier in the week at Venice): Jay Kelly, in which George Clooney leads as a major movie star suddenly questioning his worth, value and identity as a man and as an artist. But that is fictional; Springsteen is real.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	With Warren Zane's 2023 book Deliver Me From Nowhere as its source material, Cooper laser-focuses on a year where Springsteen (played with conviction and authenticity by Jeremy Allen White) was experiencing depression and past trauma, haunted by his late father and unsure how to view encroaching mega success — perhaps feeling unfaithful to and dishonest toward the blue-collar, working-class people who drove his emergence to the pinnacle of fame in the music business.


	Against all odds (and certainly the wishes of Columbia Records, which wanted another hit-generating record to follow The River), Springsteen had another idea, as this movie details what inspired Nebraska, including a deep dive into several books, the influence of Terence Malick's 1973 film Badlands, Flannery O'Connor, the Suicides' first album and real-life killers Charles Starkweather and Caril Fugate among other creative drivers — not exactly the same old, same old. In many ways, it is an album about loneliness, and it seems appropriate that Springsteen was not in the studio with his band for its core recording, rather simply alone in his New Jersey bedroom with an acoustic guitar and a 4-Track recorder where he performed the 10 tracks that would eventually make the playlist, from the title song to “Mansion on a Hill” to “Atlantic City” to “Reason To Believe” — but not some future smashes like “Born in the USA,” “Glory Days,” “I'm on Fire” and more that would be jettisoned to the next album, in the process keeping it about as pure as it gets. Springsteen wouldn't even allow his photo to appear on the album cover, instead choosing a black-and-white image from the POV of the inside of a car traveling down a desolate highway on a cloudy day.


	One of my favorite scenes has Springsteen's longtime manager Jon Landau (Jeremy Strong) going into Columbia exec Al Teller's (David Krumholtz) office to explain to him that there will be no press, no singles, no tour and no photo of Bruce for the release of the album. Bruce wants it just out there for people to discover and interpret on their own. The dynamic between the two is worth the price of admission, but as Teller finally agrees to do what they can to support the album, it's a triumph of artistry over commercialism that in this cold, corporate Donald Trump era some four-plus decades later is hard to imagine going down like that.


	The film plays in two eras weaved in and out. Springsteen's childhood in the '50s is in black-and-white as we see the stern father, Doug (Stephen Graham), not in line to win dad of the year — a man who comes home and starts drinking — and young Bruce (played nicely by Matthew Pellicano) getting the brunt of his neglect. It clearly wasn't a happy childhood, thus Cooper and his cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi's decision to leave out the color. The other part, of course, is the early '80s and creation of the record, a time where Springsteen, though in a dour state of mind, was also finding romance as seen in the film by the presence of the fictional Faye Romano, meant to represent multiple women in his life at the time and effectively played by Odessa Young. This relationship, though, seems more a convenience for dramatic license, and perhaps deviates a little too much from a film that otherwise feels 100% authentic to the core of Springsteen and his life crisis at this time. It is a minor flaw in an otherwise admirable film.


	We also see the importance of Landau in his life and career, a supportive but honest guide who is there every step of the way to keep the wolves out. Others include good friend and guitar tech Mike Batlan (Paul Walter Hauser) and his wonderful mother Adele Springsteen (Gaby Hoffman), even though those roles are underwritten compared to others. Graham, enjoying the biggest success of his career right now with the multi-Emmy nominated Adolescence, could not be better as his father — all his scenes in flashback and filtered through Bruce's memories. Also impressive is a brief turn by Marc Maron as producer, audio and recording engineer Chuck Plotkin, who had the unenviable task of somehow making those self-recorded 4-Track cuts stand up to the expected quality consumers would expect. It is fascinating to see how he was able to pull it off. And let's give a big shout-out to casting director Francine Maisler and those who put the band back together — that is, the actors who play the E Street Band.

	











	With his high-profile TV role in The Bear, White has to fight that kind of familiarity and somehow convince us he is one of the greatest rock stars in history at his lowest point ever. Mission accomplished. White, with no prior history in singing or playing guitar, studied for five months with a vocal coach as well as guitar experts. The results speak for themselves. He is utterly convincing on every count, but this is no mere SNL-style imitation. White gets to the essence of the man without copying him, but the transformation is nothing less than stunning, reminding me of what Sissy Spacek was able to accomplish playing Loretta Lynn in Coal Miner's Daughter, even as, like White, the legend she was playing was very much alive and watching. No pressure there at all, right? Give White props, especially for delivering this moving portrait of Springsteen from nowhere.


	Inevitably, there will be comparisons to last year's Oscar-nominated Bob Dylan film A Complete Unknown, which focused solely on the earliest years of Dylan as channeled through Timothée Chalamet. Almost harder to achieve though is capturing a star much further along and at the crossroads of his career, a crisis point where it just wasn't in the cards to only “play the hits.” It is watching the birth of a true artist, free now to go his own way and one who is still very much evolving. After more than half a century at it, Springsteen's “glory days” may be aging, but with the hope of the future informed by his past, he still rocks.


	Producers are Cooper, Ellen Goldsmith-Vein, Eric Robinson and Scott Stuber.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testifies during a US Senate hearing for his nomination to serve as secretary of health and human services on January 29, 2025 in Washington, DC.

Make America Healthy Again is "a great slogan," the senator wrote. "The problem is that since coming into office President Trump and Mr. Kennedy have done exactly the opposite."

"Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of health and human services, is endangering the health of the American people now and into the future. He must resign."

That's how US Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee Ranking Member Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) began a New York Times op-ed on Saturday, amid mounting calls for Kennedy to leave the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), by choice or force, following the ouster of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Susan Monarez.

As Sanders detailed in the Times—and a Thursday letter to Senate HELP Committee Chair Bill Cassidy (R-La.) demanding a congressional probe—Monarez was fired after reportedly refusing to "act as a rubber stamp for his dangerous policies." Her exit led to resignations and a staff walkout at the CDC, which is now being led by Jim O'Neill, a Kennedy aide and biotech investor.

Sanders and other lawmakers—including former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), a polio survivor and the only Republican to vote against Kennedy's confirmation in February—have long warned about the consequences of letting RFK Jr. hold a key health policy position in President Donald Trump's second administration.

"Mr. Kennedy and the rest of the Trump administration tell us, over and over, that they want to Make America Healthy Again," Sanders noted Saturday. "That's a great slogan. I agree with it. The problem is that since coming into office President Trump and Mr. Kennedy have done exactly the opposite."

"Despite the overwhelming opposition of the medical community, Secretary Kennedy has continued his long-standing crusade against vaccines and his advocacy of conspiracy theories that have been rejected repeatedly by scientific experts," the senator wrote. "It is absurd to have to say this in 2025, but vaccines are safe and effective. That, of course, is not just my view. Far more important, it is the overwhelming consensus of the medical and scientific communities."

Sanders pointed to guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Medical Association, and World Health Organization, and called out Kennedy's comments on autism, Covid-19 and polio vaccines, and immunizations in general.

"The reality is that Secretary Kennedy has profited from and built a career on sowing mistrust in vaccines. Now, as head of HHS, he is using his authority to launch a full-blown war on science, on public health, and on truth itself," he wrote, warning that in the "short term, it will be harder for Americans to get lifesaving vaccines," including for Covid.

However, "Covid is just the beginning. Mr. Kennedy's next target may be the childhood immunization schedule, the list of recommended vaccines that children receive to protect them from diseases like measles, chickenpox. and polio," the senator continued. He also sounded the alarm over the secretary "defunding the research that could help us prepare for the next pandemic."

Sanders, a leading advocate of Medicare for All, also took aim at the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Trump signed last month.

"America's healthcare system is already dysfunctional and wildly expensive, and yet the Trump administration will be throwing an estimated 15 million people off their health insurance through a cut of over $1 trillion to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act," he noted. "This cut is also expected to result in the closing of or the decline in services at hundreds of nursing homes, hospitals, and community health centers. As a result of cuts to the Affordable Care Act, health insurance costs will soar for millions of Americans. That is not Making America Healthy Again."

"Secretary Kennedy is putting Americans' lives in danger, and he must resign," Sanders concluded. "In his place, President Trump must listen to doctors and scientists and nominate a health secretary and a CDC director who will protect the health and well-being of the American people, not carry out dangerous policies based on conspiracy theories."

Doctors, journalists, and others praised the senator's op-ed, with Trauma surgeon Mark Hoofnagle saying that "Bernie nails it."

Pennsylvania State University professor and A Desire Called America author Christian Haines wrote on the social media platform Bluesky that the piece was "clear and incisive, though I wish it didn't need to be said."

Also sharing the post on Bluesky, former Times labor reporter Steven Greenhouse said: "It's delusional for anyone to think that RFK Jr. and Donald Trump are making America healthy again. With Kennedy's war against science, truth, and vaccines and Trump's war against Medicaid, their movement should be called MAKING AMERICA UNHEALTHY AGAIN."

President Donald Trump was spotted heading to golf with his granddaughter Trump following bogus conspiracy theories about his health.

The Republican, 79, was seen on the south lawn of the White House getting into a vehicle with granddaughter Kai at about 8.45am on Saturday.

Trump sported his go-to golf outfit for the trip in Virginia - black pants, a white polo shirt and his signature red MAGA hat.

His appearance comes after unfounded rumors circulated online claiming Trump was sick or even had died - with the hashtag '#whereistrump' going viral on Friday.

The speculation began after several White House reporters noted the president had not been seen in public since a marathon cabinet meeting on Tuesday and had no events scheduled all weekend.

And the unfounded rumors went into overdrive after Vice President JD Vance told USA Today he was ready to step in for Trump if 'If there's a terrible tragedy'.

The rumors were also fanned by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who asked people to pray for Trump as he claimed without evidence, that the president was in a 'health crisis,' and looked like he was about to 'collapse'.

The outing came amid wild rumors surrounding the Repulican's health. Trump sported his go-to golf outfit - black pants, a white polo shirt and his signature red MAGA hat

The speculation began after several White House reporters noted the president had not been seen in public since a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, pictured

But the rumors were quashed by Axios journalist Barak Ravid who revealed a US official had confirmed the president is in good health.

'Trump is OK. Will play Golf this morning,' Ravid wrote on X shortly before images emerged of the president and his granddaughter. 

Earlier this week Trump sat down for a mammoth cabinet meeting ahead of Labor Day to, 'celebrate the victories American workers have experienced over the past eight months', per the White House.

On Wednesday, he had a meeting with his son-in-law Jared Kushner, former British prime minister Tony Blair and Israeli official Ron Dermer to discuss a post-war plan for Gaza. 

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt revealed in July that the president was suffering from 'chronic venous insufficiency,' that was causing 'mild swelling' in his lower legs.

The president's physician revealed in an memo that his condition was, 'a benign and common condition' in elderly people, but that there was no evidence of any serious arterial disease.

People with the condition often are advised to lose weight, walk for exercise and elevate their legs periodically, and some may be advised to wear compression stockings. Severe cases over time can lead to complications including lower leg sores called ulcers. Blood clots are one cause, but was ruled out, Leavitt said.

Leavitt said the condition wasn't causing the president any discomfort. She wouldn't discuss how he was treating the condition and suggested those details would be in the doctor's letter, which was later released to the public.

The White House disclosed in July that President Donald Trump was checked out by his doctor after noticeable 'swelling' on his hands and legs

 But the letter was the same as what she read, and it did not include any additional details.

Trump also sparked concern after bruising was spotted on the back of his hand, however his physician revealed that it was a result of 'irritation from frequent handshaking and use of aspirin 'as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention' treatment.

Despite the conspiracy theories surrounding his health, Trump's Truth Social account was active on Friday when he issued a statement about tariffs after a federal appeals court ruled Friday that President Trump had no legal right to impose sweeping tariffs

The post said: 'ALL TARIFFS ARE STILL IN EFFECT! Today a Highly Partisan Appeals Court incorrectly said that our Tariffs should be removed, but they know the United States of America will win in the end. If these Tariffs ever went away, it would be a total disaster for the Country. It would make us financially weak, and we have to be strong. 

'The U.S.A. will no longer tolerate enormous Trade Deficits and unfair Tariffs and Non Tariff Trade Barriers imposed by other Countries, friend or foe, that undermine our Manufacturers, Farmers, and everyone else.'

Daily Mail has approached the White House for comment.

Bobby Singer, indelibly played by Jim Beaver, was a gruff and cynical, but loyal retired demon hunter and father figure not only to Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles), but many other hunters through the years. Though he died way too early on Supernatural, he made appearances through the rest of the show, as a ghost, a major rebel leader in the Apocalyptic World, and in Heaven.

Below, Jim Beaver reveals all about his fondly remembered character, his favorite Supernatural on-set memories and episode, how he feels about the “rewarding and joyful” fan conventions, and more.

Who He Plays: Bobby Singer, a father figure and hunting mentor to Sam and Dean. He appears later as a ghost and as a leader in Apocalypse World.

Convention Memories: “There have been wacky things that happened. On occasion, one of the actors gets tackled by somebody whose enthusiasm gets out of hand. And then there's finding out that someone has tattooed your face on their upper arm so that their armpit hair forms your beard! I was flattered and very mystified,” he remembers.

 

Beaver continues, “At the first convention I went to in Orlando many years ago, what struck me was how people told me that Supernatural primarily engaged them because of the relationships between the characters. And to my surprise, many said they would watch even if there were no monsters. People have come up to me with tears in their eyes telling me how the show had a strong emotional impact on their lives. It makes you feel that you've accomplished something big without even knowing you were doing it. I find it deeply moving when we on the show have been accepted with grace, tenderness, and love by the fans.”

Favorite Episode: “Weekend at Bobby's” (Season 6, Episode 4).”It was all about me,” Beaver said with a laugh. “It was a fun episode, and fans got to see another angle on the show. It was also Jensen's first episode as a director; I had a superb experience working under his direction.”

The CW

What He'd Write in a Letter to Fans: “I'd thank them… I have a line on the show that became almost a touchstone: ‘Family don't end with blood.'”

Finding Out Bobby Would Die: Of the moment he learned his character's fate, Beaver told us, “I learned I would die from the showrunners Bob Singer (my character is named after him) and Sera Gamble, who said, ‘We're going to kill you, but you're coming back as a ghost.' I ended up doing more seasons after I was dead. Still, I was disappointed that instead of doing half of a season's episodes, I'd be lucky to do one or two. But my death episode, ‘Death's Door,' was one of the best episodes of television I've ever been associated with.”

On Set Memories: “My fondest memories have to do with the fun, the jokes, the one-liners, the banter between cast and crew, and an all-around feeling of camaraderie. It was very much like being a kid at the best summer camp. There were times I wondered how we got the show shot in eight days per episode because we were having so much fun. I am also so grateful for the show giving me a connection with Terry Ann Fleming, who played Bobby's wife. She and I hit it off from the very first and became and still are deeply attached to one another.”

Mementos from the Set: Even Beaver wasn't immune from the instinct to take home a souvenir from the show set. “When I knew that Bobby's house was going to be demolished. I took home a little ceramic frog that was on Bobby's kitchen counter, and it's still in my house. Also, Jared stole a set of three little brass owls that I think he wanted for himself, but somebody suggested that I might like a souvenir, and he gave me the brass owls. I ended up auctioning them for charity. When I first showed up on the set and I saw all the books, I thought, ‘I'm probably going to end up stealing a lot of these books, but about half of them weren't real books and the other half were on obscure Canadian land deals,” he said.

If There Were an Afterlife for Bobby: The actor imagined, “We last saw Bobby in Heaven with Sam and Dean, so maybe there's a problem in Heaven that I have to tend to. Or maybe there's a new alternate universe where we all start over. If the same team talent would do another Supernatural round in some form, I would be ecstatic to be part of it.”

What He Hears from Fans: Instead of saying something to me, they ask me to say something — usually ‘Idjit' or ‘Balls,'” Beaver explained. “I wasn't crazy about those terms until they turned into catch phrases, and then I wished I'd trademarked them!”

What Supernatural meant to him: “Being on a show for 15 years is an extraordinary achievement. To be a central part of that for all those years really felt like, ‘Okay, I've done something with my life.' I had toiled in the vineyards of Hollywood for a long, long time, until these two shows, Deadwood and Supernatural, suddenly put me in a place where people knew who I was. That period in the early 2000s was a major shift in my career for which I am eternally grateful because it led me to opportunities that I never would have had otherwise,” Beaver said. “I started Supernatural thinking I was a one-episode guest star, and it ended up opening up the world to me in ways that I never really could have imagined, and provided me with a wealth of friends…some of whom I have yet to meet.”

Bobby Singer, indelibly played by Jim Beaver, was a gruff and cynical, but loyal retired demon hunter and father figure not only to Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles), but many other hunters through the years. Though he died way too early on Supernatural, he made appearances through the rest of the show, as a ghost, a major rebel leader in the Apocalyptic World, and in Heaven.

Below, Jim Beaver reveals all about his fondly remembered character, his favorite Supernatural on-set memories and episode, how he feels about the “rewarding and joyful” fan conventions, and more.

Who He Plays: Bobby Singer, a father figure and hunting mentor to Sam and Dean. He appears later as a ghost and as a leader in Apocalypse World.

Convention Memories: “There have been wacky things that happened. On occasion, one of the actors gets tackled by somebody whose enthusiasm gets out of hand. And then there's finding out that someone has tattooed your face on their upper arm so that their armpit hair forms your beard! I was flattered and very mystified,” he remembers.

 

Beaver continues, “At the first convention I went to in Orlando many years ago, what struck me was how people told me that Supernatural primarily engaged them because of the relationships between the characters. And to my surprise, many said they would watch even if there were no monsters. People have come up to me with tears in their eyes telling me how the show had a strong emotional impact on their lives. It makes you feel that you've accomplished something big without even knowing you were doing it. I find it deeply moving when we on the show have been accepted with grace, tenderness, and love by the fans.”

Favorite Episode: “Weekend at Bobby's” (Season 6, Episode 4).”It was all about me,” Beaver said with a laugh. “It was a fun episode, and fans got to see another angle on the show. It was also Jensen's first episode as a director; I had a superb experience working under his direction.”

The CW

What He'd Write in a Letter to Fans: “I'd thank them… I have a line on the show that became almost a touchstone: ‘Family don't end with blood.'”

Finding Out Bobby Would Die: Of the moment he learned his character's fate, Beaver told us, “I learned I would die from the showrunners Bob Singer (my character is named after him) and Sera Gamble, who said, ‘We're going to kill you, but you're coming back as a ghost.' I ended up doing more seasons after I was dead. Still, I was disappointed that instead of doing half of a season's episodes, I'd be lucky to do one or two. But my death episode, ‘Death's Door,' was one of the best episodes of television I've ever been associated with.”

On Set Memories: “My fondest memories have to do with the fun, the jokes, the one-liners, the banter between cast and crew, and an all-around feeling of camaraderie. It was very much like being a kid at the best summer camp. There were times I wondered how we got the show shot in eight days per episode because we were having so much fun. I am also so grateful for the show giving me a connection with Terry Ann Fleming, who played Bobby's wife. She and I hit it off from the very first and became and still are deeply attached to one another.”

Mementos from the Set: Even Beaver wasn't immune from the instinct to take home a souvenir from the show set. “When I knew that Bobby's house was going to be demolished. I took home a little ceramic frog that was on Bobby's kitchen counter, and it's still in my house. Also, Jared stole a set of three little brass owls that I think he wanted for himself, but somebody suggested that I might like a souvenir, and he gave me the brass owls. I ended up auctioning them for charity. When I first showed up on the set and I saw all the books, I thought, ‘I'm probably going to end up stealing a lot of these books, but about half of them weren't real books and the other half were on obscure Canadian land deals,” he said.

If There Were an Afterlife for Bobby: The actor imagined, “We last saw Bobby in Heaven with Sam and Dean, so maybe there's a problem in Heaven that I have to tend to. Or maybe there's a new alternate universe where we all start over. If the same team talent would do another Supernatural round in some form, I would be ecstatic to be part of it.”

What He Hears from Fans: Instead of saying something to me, they ask me to say something — usually ‘Idjit' or ‘Balls,'” Beaver explained. “I wasn't crazy about those terms until they turned into catch phrases, and then I wished I'd trademarked them!”

What Supernatural meant to him: “Being on a show for 15 years is an extraordinary achievement. To be a central part of that for all those years really felt like, ‘Okay, I've done something with my life.' I had toiled in the vineyards of Hollywood for a long, long time, until these two shows, Deadwood and Supernatural, suddenly put me in a place where people knew who I was. That period in the early 2000s was a major shift in my career for which I am eternally grateful because it led me to opportunities that I never would have had otherwise,” Beaver said. “I started Supernatural thinking I was a one-episode guest star, and it ended up opening up the world to me in ways that I never really could have imagined, and provided me with a wealth of friends…some of whom I have yet to meet.”

"When in doubt, go to a psychic," she quipped

 Hairspray fans almost missed out on watching Brittany Snow play Amber Von Tussle in the 2007 musical.


 According to Snow, her audition to play the bratty daughter of Velma Von Tussle, portrayed by Michelle Pfeiffer, didn't go as planned, but she was determined to fight for the role after remembering what a psychic once told her.


 During a sit-down with Variety, published on Monday, Aug. 25, the actress recalled messing up her first audition for the film adaptation of the 2002 Broadway musical of the same name, which was itself based on John Waters' 1988 movie starring Ricki Lake.

 "I bombed that audition. I did terribly. Adam Shankman, the director of Hairspray, he called me and he was like, 'Well, that wasn't great,'" she reflected. "I got really in my head. I got really nervous and my voice cracked."


 Although she did "pretty well at the dancing," which was crucial to Amber's role as the lead female dancer on The Corny Collins Show, Snow admitted it was not enough to compensate for her "awful" singing audition.


 "[Shankman] said to me, 'You know, what's really funny? We just got Michelle Pfeiffer connected to play Velma Von Tussle. And so it would have been really iconic if you guys were both in it," Snow remembered.


 That was the lightning bolt that reminded Snow of a previous conversation she had with a psychic.


 Two years prior, a psychic told her that she "was going to be in a huge movie with an iconic, beautiful blonde woman playing my mother."


 Following this realization, Snow decided to call Shankman back and plead for a second chance.

 "He will attest to this because it's such a crazy story," Snow said. "I said, 'I went to the psychic. And I know this sounds insane, but the psychic told me that I'm going to play Michelle Pfeiffer's daughter, basically.' "


 "And he said, 'That is the craziest story. You're so insane that I'm gonna let you audition again,'" she said.


 Although Snow believed he might have felt bad for her, she went ahead and auditioned again and "nailed it."


 "That's how I got the role. So when in doubt, go to a psychic," she quipped.

 When people hear the name Jeffrey Epstein, they usually think of scandal, crimes, and powerful connections. But one of the biggest mysteries surrounding the disgraced financier is how he made his money.


 At the time of his death in 2019, Epstein's estate was valued at nearly $600 million, yet few clear records explain how a former prep school teacher and Wall Street trader built such vast wealth. What is known is that a handful of billionaire clients—most notably retail magnate Leslie Wexner and private equity tycoon Leon Black—paid him extraordinary sums for tax and estate planning. Beyond that, Epstein's opaque businesses, offshore dealings, and questionable associations leave lingering questions about what was really going on behind the scenes.


 After a short stint as a math teacher at New York's Dalton School, Epstein moved to Wall Street in the 1970s, working as an options trader and later as a limited partner at Bear Stearns. In the early 1980s, he launched his own wealth management business, eventually operating out of the U.S. Virgin Islands, where secrecy laws shielded many details of his work.


 According to The New York Times, Epstein marketed himself as a math whiz and “financial doctor” who specialized in helping the wealthy reduce their tax bills. Epstein's most famous client was Leslie Wexner, the billionaire retail magnate behind Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works. What made their relationship unusual was that Wexner gave Epstein power of attorney—legal authority to make financial and business decisions on his behalf. That meant Epstein could sign checks, buy and sell properties, and even borrow money in Wexner's name. That is an extraordinary level of trust to place in someone with what was then a relatively short professional track record.


 Another major client was Leon Black, co-founder of Apollo Global Management, who paid Epstein more than $150 million for tax and estate planning advice. Those payments were far higher than what wealthy individuals typically spend on such services, raising further questions about why clients would pay Epstein such a premium for his work.


Epstein was a convicted sex offender who first pleaded guilty in Florida in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from a minor. He was arrested again on federal sex-trafficking charges in July 2019, but died by suicide in a Manhattan jail a month later while awaiting trial.

 Most successful money managers operate with some degree of transparency—meaning clients, regulators, and sometimes the public can see how their firms earn fees and manage investments. Not Epstein. His company operated in the Virgin Islands, where it's okay for people like Epstein to keep their financial dealings secret.


 The little that is known has fueled speculation. Aside from his connections to Wexner and Black, Epstein rarely disclosed other clients or the services he provided. This lack of visibility, combined with unusually large fees and his personal control over Wexner's fortune, has led many observers to wonder whether Epstein's financial dealings went beyond standard money management.


 Epstein's unusual relationship with Wexner was central to his wealth. His hold over his biggest reported client has long raised questions. Within a few years of meeting, the billionaire granted Epstein the power to manage his businesses and finances as he saw fit. He also reportedly gifted Epstein a lavish $77 million townhouse in New York City, and other perks, including the use of a private jet.


Epstein labeled himself a financier—someone who manages large sums of money for wealthy clients, typically focusing on investments, tax strategies, and estate planning. In Epstein's case, that meant handling billions for clients like Wexner.

 Epstein was also linked to Towers Financial, a company later exposed as one of the largest Ponzi schemes in U.S. history. A Ponzi scheme is a type of fraud in which money from new investors is used to pay earlier investors, creating the illusion of real profits when none exist.


 Steven Hoffenberg, Towers' founder, described Epstein as his “wingman” in the operation, which ultimately cheated investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars. Epstein was never charged in the case, but the association added to suspicions about how he did business.


 Epstein also made money legitimately from investing. A list of every investment he made isn't available, although we do know that the largest asset held by his estate, as of July 2025, was two funds managed by Valar Ventures, a firm co-founded by Peter Thiel that specializes in providing startup capital to financial technology companies.


 That investment, which cost Epstein $40 million in 2015 and 2016, is now worth nearly $170 million.


 A major source of Epstein's wealth came from the tax incentives he secured in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Starting in the late 1990s, Epstein set up companies there that qualified for the territory's Economic Development Program, which offered massive tax cuts—up to a 90% cut in corporate income tax and full exemptions from some local taxes.


 To qualify, firms had to employ local residents and invest in the community. Epstein reportedly saved more than $300 million in taxes between 1999 and 2018 from the program, allowing him to keep far more of his earnings than he would have on the U.S. mainland.


 Epstein died a wealthy man, with an estate worth nearly $600 million. He built that fortune, it seems, primarily from fees earned from just a few clients, as well as tax breaks that saved him several hundred million over two decades. He also left behind investments that continue to grow in value, most notably a stake in Peter Thiel's Valar Ventures.

This week, scientists toying with the afterglow of phosphor particles have been able to make succulents glow like something out of Avatar, new fossils have revealed that an ankylosaur known as Spicomellus afer was covered in enormous spikes that were fused to its bones, and, in 1978, a physicist was struck through the head by a proton beam traveling close to the speed of light and survived – a new 3D digital analysis shows how. Finally, you may have heard a lot about radioactive shrimp recently. We explore why frozen seafood glows in the dark.

The map of the world as you know it – the Mercator projection – isn't totally accurate. The real size of many countries is distorted and this is often reflected in perceived power and politics. Now, Africa is leading the charge to get rid of it for good. Last week, the African Union, a continental union of 55 member states, endorsed a campaign to replace the Mercator map with an alternative map that more accurately reflects the size of Africa (just wait until you see it). Read the full story here



Scientists toying with the afterglow of phosphor particles were stunned to see how uniformly they could diffuse across succulent plants when injected into their leaves. The result is a succulent that glows like something out of Avatar, lasting for hours, and is even rechargeable. When asked if the result was surprising, the study authors admitted, “It was really unexpected.” Read the full story here



In a new attempt to narrow down what the famous "Wow!" Signal might be, a team of scientists re-analyzed decades of data from the Big Ear telescope using modern signal analysis techniques, as well as analyzing data that had previously been unpublished, producing two not-yet-peer-reviewed papers on the topic. Their findings concluded that it likely has an extraterrestrial origin after all, and may have been even more intense than previously believed. Read the full story here



The ankylosaurs were a very impressive group of dinosaurs covered in armored plates with clubs for tails (that may have sounded like birds), but we've just discovered that the oldest known member of the group may have also been the most badass. New fossils have revealed that an ankylosaur known as Spicomellus afer was covered in enormous spikes that were fused to its bones, some almost a meter (3.3 feet) long. Read the full story here



In 1978, while inspecting a faulty detector inside the Soviet Union's most powerful particle accelerator, physicist Anatoli Bugorski was struck in the head by a proton beam traveling close to the speed of light. Amazingly, Bugorski remains alive to this day, and while government secrecy prevented details of his medical assessment from being leaked, researchers have now reconstructed the path that the high-energy ray blazed through his brain. Read the full story here

Heard a lot about radioactive shrimp recently? The advent of refrigeration and freezing has meant we can now store food in our houses until we're ready to eat it. Perishable items like prawns can sit snuggly in the dark of our freezer, waiting until it's their time to shine – only, some of that seafood might already be glowing without you knowing.
