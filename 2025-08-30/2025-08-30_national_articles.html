                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK (AP) — For the first time at this U.S. Open, Coco Gauff didn't double-fault in her first service game. And for the first time, she didn't get broken to begin things, either. With her work-in-progress serve looking the best it has so far in this trip to Flushing Meadows, the No. 3-seeded Gauff turned in by far her most solid — and stress-free — performance Saturday, defeating No. “It's been like an emotional week … but I think I needed those tough moments to move forward,” said Gauff, who will face four-time major champion Naomi Osaka on Monday for a berth in the quarterfinals. “I was putting too much pressure on myself.” Osaka, who won titles in New York in 2018 and 2020, moved into the fourth round — a stage she last got to at any major at the 2021 Australian Open — with a 6-0, 4-6, 6-3 victory over No. Back in 2019, during Gauff's first U.S. Open, when she was just 15, she lost to reigning champion Osaka in the third round. Afterward, Osaka consoled a teary Gauff and encouraged her to address the crowd. After two difficult wins under the lights at night in Arthur Ashe Stadium, Gauff started Saturday's schedule with an 11:30 a.m. match. “It was kind of hard to see the ball,” Gauff said, “but overall, I'm happy with the way I played.” In both of her earlier outings, against Ajla Tomljanovic on Tuesday and Donna Vekic on Thursday, Gauff fell behind 2-0. Against Frech, the 21-year-old from Florida went up 3-0, before running into a hint of trouble: Gauff slapped a second serve into the net to double-fault and get broken, getting Frech within 3-2, and soon it was 3-all after 26 minutes. So, essentially, they were starting over, and the next game was pivotal. Gauff led 40-love but wound up at 40-30 after shanking a forehand that landed 10 feet out. She heard, looked around and clutched a ball for her next serve, vigorously shaking it. Gauff stepped to the baseline and delivered a 105 mph first serve that drew an errant return. Upon watching the ball land out, she leaned forward, clenched her left fist and screamed “Come on!” That began a set-closing three-game run and Gauff was on her way. Her serve has become a major issue, which is why she brought aboard a biomechanics expert, Gavin MacMillan, who helped Aryna Sabalenka settle her serving yips and rise to No. She has been the worst player on the women's tour in that category this season and reached a low point with 23 in a victory at Montreal last month, and 14 more in her next match. What got her through those was the rest of her game: returning, defending and a clear superiority once the ball was in play. Those last three areas were again strengths for Gauff. She broke Frech five times and was terrific whenever their baseline exchanges lasted more than four shots, taking 35 of those 51 points. All eyes were on Gauff's serve, of course, and that showed quite an improvement on Saturday: four double-faults and just the one break. Howard Fendrich has been the AP's tennis writer since 2002.</p>

People hold signs warning drivers of a checkpoint operated by the Metropolitan Police Department and federal agencies, including officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), on Georgia Avenue in the northern part of Washington, Saturday, Aug. 30, 2025. Federal agents talk to a driver at a checkpoint operated by the Metropolitan Police Department and federal agencies, including officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), on Georgia Avenue in the northern part of Washington, Saturday, Aug. 30, 2025. WASHINGTON (AP) — It's a scene that has played out on the streets of Washington and Los Angeles since President Donald Trump declared a crime emergency in the nation's capital and ramped up deportations nationwide: Federal agents, some in masks, grabbing someone off the street, bundling the person into a car and driving away, ignoring questions from bystanders. Urban leaders, police officials and civil rights advocates say federal agents are not the best equipped for this type of policing. Here are some key things to know about the differences in how federal authorities and local police operate: Federal agents have not historically played much of a role in everyday policing. Other U.S. investigative agencies have mostly focused on major interstate crimes and national security matters. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has more traditionally done nationwide work tracking down immigrants who are in the United States illegally but has ramped up operations since Trump took office in January. After protests over the deaths of Black men at the hands of police in recent years, many cities made policy changes to enhance accountability and transparency. Most large police departments, for example, require officers to wear cameras on patrol. Many agencies release the footage upon request or under their state public records law. Federal agencies have not embraced such change, despite some tentative steps to keep pace with their local counterparts. In 2022, Democratic President Joe Biden issued an executive order requiring federal law enforcement agencies to adopt body-camera policies for officers who are on patrol, making arrests and or conducting searches. Body-worn cameras “have been good for everybody,” said Lauren Bonds, executive director of the National Police Accountability Project. Bonds said such policies protect officers from meritless citizen complaints and make it easier for the public to get justice if they have been wronged. They should be doing their jobs in a way that's lawful and constitutional.” Civil rights advocates have complained that such tactics erode trust between communities and law enforcement and make holding individual officers to account for abuses more difficult. Administration officials say masks are needed to protect federal agents. Troy Edgar, deputy DHS secretary, wrote in an op-ed for Fox News that mask-wearing protects federal law enforcement officers from doxing and harassment. But photos and videos reviewed by The Associated Press do not show agents always wearing clear badges, tags or other identifiers during encounters with the public. Masks were once largely forbidden on the federal level unless an agent was working undercover, said Michael Bouchard, a former assistant director at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco Firearms and Explosives who retired in 2007. Being clearly identifiable builds trust and allows people to report any issues they might have with a particular officer, Bouchard said. Most local arrest reports are a matter of public record. Some local agencies even disclose such information to citizens in email groups or on social media websites. Getting access to basic arrest details from the federal government has proved far harder. Administration officials have been releasing daily arrest totals and some of the charges that people are facing, but information on which agency made which arrests and who is facing what charges has been difficult to find. Those seeking details about federal arrests are frequently directed to file a request under the Freedom of Information Act. “When the agencies doing the policing have backlogs that measure in years or sometimes decades, FOlA is completely ineffective at getting policing records in any kind of useful time frame,” said Kel McClanahan, an attorney at the firm National Security Counselors who frequently works on public information issues. In June, for example, Rosa Soto scrambled to find where a longtime family friend, Martin Guzman, was taken after he was detained by immigration authorities at a Home Depot in Chino, California. “We are getting some violent people off the streets -- but in the long run, at what cost?” Jaron Hickman, a senior police commander in Washington, said at a public forum Tuesday. Norm Nixon, 62, an associate minister at Union Temple Baptist Church in Washington's historically Black Anacostia neighborhood, said federal operations were changing the way residents felt about the city's police force. “Now, with these federal guys coming in, people just see them all as law enforcement,” Nixon said. “Some of the young people I talk to feel like the local police officers are traitors now, that they are really against us and out to get us.” Contact the AP's global investigative team at [email protected] or https://www.ap.org/tips/</p>

Local residents stand near their destroyed home following Russian air strike in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, Saturday, Aug. 30, 2025. KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia launched a large aerial attack on southern Ukraine, officials said Saturday, two days after a rare airstrike on central Kyiv killed 23 and damaged European Union diplomatic offices as U.S.-led efforts to end the three-year war staggered. Among other locations hit, the assault overnight into Saturday struck a five-story residential building, killing at least one civilian and wounding 28 people, including children, in the Zaporizhzhia region, Gov. The Kremlin on Thursday said Russia remained interested in continuing peace talks, despite the air attack on Kyiv that was one of the largest and deadliest since Moscow's full-scale invasion in 2022. The attacks came less than two weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump met Russia's Vladimir Putin for a summit in Alaska, a meeting that marked the end of Putin's diplomatic isolation in the West but yielded few details on how the war might end. Children were among the dead, and search and rescue efforts continued for hours to pull people from the rubble. Hours after the attack, the United States approved an $825 million arms sale to Ukraine that will include extended-range missiles and related equipment to boost its defensive capabilities. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday expressed frustration with what he called Russia's lack of constructive engagement. Trump said Friday he expects to decide on next steps in two weeks if direct talks aren't scheduled between the two leaders. Meanwhile, Ukraine's European allies have accused Putin of dragging his feet in peace efforts and avoiding serious negotiations while Russian troops move deeper into the country. Moscow's forces are waging a “nonstop” offensive along almost the whole 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line in Ukraine, and have the “strategic initiative,” the chief of Russia's general staff said Saturday. Valery Gerasimov's address to his deputies was published by Russia's Defense Ministry. Since March, Moscow has taken more than 3,500 square kilometers (1,351 square miles) of Ukrainian territory, and captured 149 settlements, Gerasimov said. Russian forces this month broke into Ukraine's southeastern Dnipropetrovsk region, a Ukrainian military official said Wednesday, pressing into an eighth Ukrainian province in a possible bid to strengthen the Kremlin's negotiating hand. Gerasimov on Saturday said Moscow's troops have so far taken seven settlements in Dnipropetrovsk. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU was advancing toward seizing frozen Russian assets to hand to Ukraine. “It's clear that the predator has to pay for what he did,” she said, referring to Putin. Von der Leyen spoke Saturday in Estonia in a joint news conference with Prime Minister Kristen Michal, while on a four-day tour tour of European states bordering Russia or its ally Belarus. Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Prévot said his government opposed the move, as it “would trigger a system financial instability, and also erodes trusts in the euro.” He said the assets should remain frozen until Russia pays Ukraine reparations. Over two days on Friday and Saturday, EU officials discussed sanctions on Russia, ramping up defense supplies to Kyiv, postwar security guarantees and Ukraine's prospects for joining the 27-nation bloc. Separately, Ukraine has continued to strike oil refineries inside Russia that it says have supplied Moscow's war effort, the Ukrainian general staff reported Saturday. It said two facilities were hit overnight: in the Krasnodar region near occupied Crimea, and the Samara region farther northeast. Falling drone debris sparked a fire at a refinery in the city of Krasnodar, regional Russian authorities confirmed Saturday. The Krasnodar refinery produces approximately 3 million tons per year of petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel. Gas stations have run dry in some regions of Russia after Ukrainian drones struck oil infrastructure in recent weeks, with motorists waiting in long lines and officials resorting to rationing or cutting off sales altogether. To try to ease the shortage, Russia has paused gasoline exports, with officials Wednesday declaring a full ban until Sept. 30 and a partial ban affecting traders and intermediaries until Oct. 31. Analysts expect the gasoline crisis to ease by late September as demand subsides and the annual summer maintenance for many refineries is finished. Still, the shortages have highlighted a vulnerability on the homefront that Ukraine could exploit further as drone warfare evolves. In a separate development, Ukraine's former parliament speaker and a prominent pro-Western politician was shot dead in the city of Lviv on Saturday, according to statements by Zelenskyy and local authorities. Little is known so far about the perpetrator, or why Andriy Parubiy was targeted. Zelenskyy decried Parubiy's “terrible murder,” and vowed to open an investigation. Parubiy, 54, was a lawmaker from the Lviv region who participated in Ukraine's Orange Revolution in 2004 and led self-defense volunteer units during the Maidan protests of 2014, which forced pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych from office.</p>

References to President Donald Trump's two impeachment trials were removed in July and restored in August with revisions that still describe his House impeachments and Senate acquittals on counts of inciting an insurrection, abusing power and obstructing Congress.” (AP Photo/Calvin Woodward) WASHINGTON (AP) — In an afternoon's walk through ground zero of Americana — the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History — objects around every corner invite one question: What could possibly be more American than this? There's the enormous Star-Spangled Banner in all its timeworn glory, Dorothy's ruby slippers from “The Wizard of Oz” and totems of achievement throughout. There are also testaments to pain and cruelty. What could be more American than a reckoning with the nation's sins, as illustrated by shackles representing slavery and photos of Japanese Americans confined to detention camps in World War II? In myriad ways, the museum explores “the complexity of our past,” in accord with its mission statement. President Donald Trump wants a simpler tale told. He wants this and the other Smithsonian museums to mirror American pride, power and accomplishment without all the darkness, and he threatens to hold back money if they don't get with that program. On social media, Trump complained that at the Smithsonian museums, which are free to visit and get most of their money from the government, “everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was, and how unaccomplished the downtrodden have been — Nothing about Success, nothing about Brightness, nothing about the Future.” A new sign at the presidential impeachment exhibit in the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History in Washington, describes the counts against President Donald Trump in his second impeachment trial. The Senate acquitted him in both trials. The sign, seen here Aug. 26, 2025, replaces earlier, temporary text but still addresses what he was charged for. On this wandering tour you can see navigational implements used by Blackbeard, the terrifying pirate, from his early 1700s raids on the Atlantic coast. A much earlier genius, the founding father Benjamin Franklin, is presented both as a gifted inventor and a slave owner who publicly came to denounce slavery yet never freed his own. Those nuances and ambiguities may not be long for this world. Still on display at the history museum are artifacts and documents of American ingenuity, subjugation, generosity, racism, grit, dishonor, verve, playfulness, corruption, heroism, and cultural appropriation. Even so, there is plenty to provoke the Republican president. In the “Great Debate” of an American democracy exhibition, a wall is emblazoned with large words such as “Privilege” and “Slavery.” The museum presents fulsome tributes to the contributions of immigrants and narratives about the racist landscape that many encountered. Exhibits address “food justice,” the exploitation of Filipinos after the United States annexed their land and the network of oppressive Native American boarding schools from which Jim Thorpe emerged and became one of the greatest athletes of all time. Hawaii's last sovereign before its annexation by the U..S. in the 1890s, Queen Lili‘uokalani, is quoted on a banner as asking: “Is the AMERICAN REPUBLIC of STATES to DEGENERATE and become a COLONIZER?” Museum visitors are told the new instrument was held up by the monarchs as a symbol of anti-colonial independence. “Ukuleles are both a product of U.S. imperialism and a potent symbol of Native Hawaiian resistance,” says the accompanying text. Noting that “modern scholarship focuses on the fallible man rather than the marble hero,” the text says Washington's image “is still used for inspiration, patriotism and commercial gain” and that “he continues to hold a place for many as a symbolic ‘father' of the country.” Their patriotic work proceeds at a snail's pace. “The Philadelphia is a symbol of how citizens of a newly formed nation came together, despite overwhelming odds against their success,” said Jennifer Jones, the project's director. “This boat's fragile condition is symbolic of our democracy; it requires the nation's attention and vigilance to preserve it for future generations.” He wants U.S. history cast in a more positive light. That's where references to Trump's two impeachments were removed in July for updating, and were restored this month. “On December 18, 2019, the House impeached Donald Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress,” one label now states. “On January 13, 2021, Donald Trump became the first president to be impeached twice,” says another. The history museum doesn't offer answers for that predicament. Instead, it asks questions throughout its halls on the fundamentals of Americanism. “Do we need to share a common national story?” Associated Press writer Lynn Berry contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump speaks with reporters as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, from right, FIFA President Gianni Infantino, Vice President JD Vance, Richard Grenell, president of the Kennedy Center Board of Trustees and Andrew Giuliani listen in the Oval Office of the White House, Friday, Aug. 22, 2025, in Washington. President Donald Trump holds a photo of himself with Russian President Vladimir Putin as FIFA President Gianni Infantino watches during an announcement in the Oval Office of the White House, Friday, Aug. 22, 2025, in Washington. Federal agents stage outside a Home Depot during an operation Friday, Aug. 15, 2025, in Los Angeles. Soccer fans from Africa “are a little bit jittery” about current events in the U.S., Infantino was told at a news conference in Kenya which urged him to ensure African visitors to the tournament do not feel “outcast ... second-class citizens.” The FIFA leader was reminded he met yet again last week with U.S. President Donald Trump, who now has a gold World Cup trophy sitting in a glass case on his desk in the White House. “We are going to play it in a country where some of us do not feel welcome,” said a reporter from South Africa, the home country of FIFA vice president Patrice Motsepe who sat beside Infantino at a luxury hotel in Nairobi. Motsepe is the brother-in-law of South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa, who had a tense visit to the White House in May when Trump repeated his administration's baseless claims of white farmers being systematic killed in the country. Egypt, Morocco and South Africa are likely to qualify in October as current leaders of qualifying groups. A 10th African team could advance in inter-continental playoffs scheduled after the tournament draw, which Trump and Infantino announced in the Oval Office last week will be held in Washington D.C. at the Kennedy Center on Dec. 5. “Everyone will be welcome in North America next year for the World Cup,” said Infantino, whose long-standing ties to Trump got him a seat in the Capitol Rotunda for the president's inauguration in January. “I think it's important to clarify this, there is a lot of misconception out there,” the FIFA leader told a roomful of African media. Tickets for the 104 World Cup games go on sale Sept. 10 amid long-standing concerns about fans getting visas to enter the U.S. which has travel bans and watch lists for dozens of countries. Motsepe, a billionaire businessman who has led Africa's soccer body since 2021, insisted discreet work with U.S. authorities had secured commitments to make the World Cup run smoothly. “We are confident that we will fulfill whatever requirements they may have and there will be sufficient access to African fans in the World Cup next year,” Motsepe said. Infantino claimed fans came from 164 countries to the month-long Club World Cup hosted in 11 U.S. cities in June and July “without of course any problems” with visas. Eight games are scheduled at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, including the U.S. team's opener June 12. “Be positive,” Infantino said in Kenya, “you will see there will be a great, great celebration of the greatest FIFA World Cup ever.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Attorney General Pam Bondi on Friday fired a Justice Department employee for protesting against federal troops stationed in Washington, D.C. Elizabeth Baxter was removed from her position as a paralegal specialist in the department's Environment and Natural Resources Division after she flipped off National Guard patrolling D.C. amid President Donald Trump's federal takeover of the city to combat crime. DOJ spokesman Gates McGavick praised the termination on Friday, writing in a post on X, “if you don't support law enforcement, [Attorney General Pam Bondi's] DOJ might not be a good fit.” Earlier this month, paralegal Sean Dunn was fired from the department and slapped with a misdemeanor charge after being video recorded yelling obscenities at federal agents and throwing a Subway sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection officer. A memo signed by Bondi on Friday said Baxter was fired “effective immediately” for “inappropriate conduct.” Very simple: if you don't support law enforcement, @AGPamBondi's DOJ might not be a good fit. Trump's D.C. takeover has stirred controversy due to concerns that his actions constitute an authoritarian abuse of presidential powers. Others have defended the policy as necessary to combat crime in the country's capital, with D.C. mayor Muriel Bowser expressing thanks to Trump earlier this week for sending troops to assist the district's understaffed police force. “The most significant thing that we are highlighting today is the area of crime that was most troubling for us in 2023,” she said, noting that since the surge of federal officers, carjackings fell by 87% compared to the same period last year. So this surge has been important to us.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Republicans in Congress are facing mounting pressure from both sides of the aisle about whether to extend additional Obamacare premium tax credit subsidies as part of legislation to avoid a government shutdown this fall. Brian Blase, head of the Trump-aligned Paragon Health Institute, told reporters Thursday that bad actors, mainly insurance brokers, abuse these zero-premium plans by enrolling ineligible people and taking the payout from federal reimbursement. “What we are saying is happening is not a small-scale fraud activity; it is a nationwide massive amount of fraud and improper enrollment that has been perpetuated because of bad government policy, and that harms the legitimate enrollees and harms taxpayers that are funding all of this money,” said Blase. Paragon estimates that as many as 6.4 million enrollees did not actually have income between 100% and 150% of the FPL and thus were improperly collecting premium subsidies, to the tune of $27 billion annually. 1 goal should be, ‘How do we preserve and extend these so that we can get coverage to the right people? If they earned more than predicted and, therefore, received more in subsidies than they should have, there is a limit on the amount that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services can recapture from them, depending on their income in relation to the poverty line. That means those individuals got to keep at least some, if not all, of their subsidy despite misreporting income. In states that have expanded Medicaid coverage under Obamacare to slightly higher income levels, only people above 138% of the poverty line are eligible for subsidized exchange plans. Blase said that makes the math harder, but Paragon estimates that roughly 1.32 million enrollees in expansion states were improperly enrolled in a fully subsidized category. Paragon's report also argues that it is easier for people to be enrolled in both Medicaid and an Obamacare exchange plan in states with Medicaid expansion. “The larger subsidies mean that consumers are less sensitive to prices of plans and are more likely to enroll,” reads Paragon's report on the topic. A Congressional Budget Office report from Aug. 25 found a similar pattern of overreporting income in states that did not expand Medicaid coverage, but its numbers are significantly lower than Paragon's estimates. The CBO estimates that 1.3 million marketplace enrollees intentionally overinflated their incomes in 2023 to receive the premium tax credit, and that number ballooned to 2.3 million in 2025. CBO's analysis of HealthCare.gov data found that a disproportionate number of enrollees from states that did not expand Medicaid reported income between 100% and 105% of the FPL, outnumbering the percentage of the population in that income range who did not have an employment-based plan or Medicaid. In other words, more people claimed to make between 100% and 105% of the FPL than actually existed, according to the CBO. “The enhanced tax credits have made available coverage with no premium to the lowest-income enrollees, which has proven to be a powerful incentive to get insurance, especially for healthier people who may not think they need coverage,” said Levitt. “The enhanced premium subsidies have also made coverage more affordable for middle-income people who were eligible for no financial help before.” Ghazal told the Washington Examiner that industry leaders are pressuring Congress to include extending the premium subsidies in the government funding legislation that must be passed before Sept. 30 to avoid a shutdown in October. This is especially important considering that open enrollment for insurance plans starts Nov. 1. Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act also shortened the Obamacare open enrollment deadline by a month, from Jan. 15 to Dec. 15, narrowing the window even further for Congress to act should it decide to extend the subsidies. Ghazal said that conversations on Capitol Hill are “not quite bipartisan” at this point, but she hopes they will be before the Sept. 30 spending deadline. Without the subsidies, healthcare costs are expected to increase dramatically on Jan. 1. The CBO estimated that more than 4 million people will be priced out of Obamacare coverage if subsidies expire, raising the uninsured rate. Pope said there's merit to the evidence that suggests system-wide fraud because of the Biden-era subsidies, but he also said the consequences of not extending them could be too much for Republicans seeking reelection. “These subsidies are very big, and they would have an immediate impact, and so I think there's going to be a real desire to not get caught on the wrong side of it, politically, from Republicans,” said Pope. A July poll from Tony Fabrizio and Bob Ward, GOP pollsters praised by Trump in the past, found that Republicans in swing districts for House seats could benefit from supporting the extended tax credits. The poll found that Republicans who supported the tax credits could gain a 6-point advantage over Democrats overall and a 4-point lead among most likely voters. A handful of Senate Republicans expressed interest in extending the tax credits during and immediately after the passage of Trump's reconciliation package. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Susan Collins (R-ME), Thom Tillis (R-NC), and Josh Hawley (R-MO).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For one final time, Lee Corso will don the head of a college football mascot and utter his famous catchphrase: “Not so fast, my friend.” Saturday's ESPN broadcast of defending national champion Ohio State hosting Texas will signal the end of the era as Corso steps away after a legendary stint in college football. Known for his larger-than-life personality – and the even bigger mascot heads he's worn – Corso retires as one of the pioneers of football television. I hope I have done that,” Corso said on stage at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles when he was honored at the ESPYs in July. Over a 28-year career, he coached at Louisville, Indiana, Navy and Northern Illinois, as well as a brief stint as the head coach of the Orlando Renegades in the United States Football League (USFL). He was hired to be part of ESPN's “College GameDay” program as an analyst in 1987 and, for 38 seasons, has remained an anchor of the team. In 1996, Corso started something that had a lasting impact not only on the show but on college football as a whole: wearing oversized mascot headgear during live broadcasts. Ahead of that season's Ohio State-Penn State game, Corso put on Buckeyes mascot Brutus' headgear and the rest was history. Since then, Corso has dressed up as Notre Dame's Fighting Irish Leprechaun, the Stanford Tree, and even rode a motorcycle with the Oregon Duck, among many others that brought smiles to not only the faces of fans but also his colleagues. Corso would don the comically large headpieces while making game predictions, holding a Ticonderoga No. 2 pencil in hand and uttering his famous catchphrase. This famed tradition has been a staple on ESPN's college football coverage for almost four decades. Corso has made 430 mascot headgear selections all-time, compiling a 286-144 record. He has thrown on Brutus' head the most at 45 times with Alabama mascot Big Al's head coming in second with 38 picks. He has worn the headgear of 69 different teams and, as a former assistant coach at Navy, has never picked against the Midshipmen. “My family and I will be forever indebted for the opportunity to be part of ESPN and College Gameday for nearly 40 years,” Corso said when his retirement was announced in April. “I have a treasure of many friends, fond memories and some unusual experiences to take with me into retirement.” A year later, he was honored by the National College Football Awards Association with the Contributions to College Football Award in recognition of his lifetime of achievement and integrity in the sport. Ahead of his final game, Corso was honored by Southwest Airlines as he waited to board his flight to Columbus, with the staff and waiting customers all giving him a standing ovation. Corso steps away as a seemingly ever-present figure on college football coverage and one whose impact will be felt for the next generation of broadcasters and fans. Will someone else put on the mascot headgear to continue and honor Corso's tradition? Or will the segment also be retired alongside Corso? One thing is for sure though: The future of college football broadcasting will most certainly look very different without him on the panel.</p>

Holly speaks with Fox News Digital about the caught-on-camera attack in downtown Cincinnati on July 26 that left her with severe injuries and forced her into hiding. As the investigation into a viral beating in Cincinnati that shook the nation and has been described as "a racial issue" continues, a victim and multiple suspects are facing criminal charges. The video circulated rapidly on social media, sparking fury as at least two White victims were pummeled into the ground by a group of Black suspects. Instead, they continued to stomp on the victims, one of whom was left with a life-altering brain issue. Mayor Aftab Pureval speaks at a press conference about early Saturday morning's viral beatdown in downtown Cincinnati on Friday, Aug. 1, 2025. Meanwhile, suspects have been rounded up locally and across state lines. All have been charged at the state level, and some face serious federal charges. Here is the status of each suspect: He has been charged federally with conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute 40 grams or more of fentanyl and operating a premises for the purpose of trafficking narcotics. Thursday, he appeared before a federal judge for a bond hearing, and his attorney Kara Blackney successfully argued that since he has no prior violent felony convictions and plenty of ties to the Cincinnati community, including three children and a business, he should be released from custody while awaiting trial on those charges. However, federal prosecutors immediately appealed that decision, and as of Friday, Mathews remained in custody where he will stay until the appeal is heard. Those drug charges arose after he posted a $270,000 bond and was released from local custody on the charges stemming from the fight: three counts of felonious assault, three counts of assault and two counts of aggravated rioting. Jermaine Mathews was brought before Hamilton County Common Pleas Court Judge, Alan Triggs for his arraignment in Cincinnati, Ohio, Thursday, Aug. 14, 2025. The charges stem from a downtown beating on July 26, 2025. Despite the federal charge, Hamilton County Jail records indicate that Merriweather is still being held in Cincinnati. Montianez Merriwether was brought before Hamilton County Common Pleas Court Judge, Alan Triggs for his arraignment, Cincinnati, Ohio, Thursday, Aug. 14, 2025. The charges stem from a downtown beating on July 26, 2025. He is described as a "main instigator" of the fight. Holly revealed that she suffered "very bad brain trauma" during the attack, and is unsure the degree to which she will recover. He was arrested in Georgia and hauled back to Cincinnati, where he was booked into the Hamilton County Jail on Aug. 14. Patrick Rosemond was arrested for his alleged involvement in the Cincinnati brawl while in Fulton County, Georgia on Monday, Aug. 4, 2025. Wright has 22 prior arrests and two prior felony convictions, one for trafficking heroin and one for possessing a firearm as a prohibited person. Kittle has been charged with three counts of felonious assault, three counts of assault and two counts of aggravated rioting and is being held on a $150,000 bond in the Hamilton County Jail. At an Aug. 14 arraignment, he was ordered to remain in jail pending a mental health assessment. During that hearing, his attorney said he suffers from schizophrenia and has been found not guilty by way of insanity on previous charges. Nonetheless, prosecutors called him a "grave danger to the community." Dominique Kittle was brought before Hamilton County Common Pleas Court Judge, Alan Triggs for his arraignment in Cincinnati, Ohio, Thursday, Aug. 14, 2025. The charges stem from a downtown beating on July 26, 2025. Vernon is one of two female suspects who was arrested in connection with the attack. She paid that bond and was released from jail with an electronic ankle monitor pending trial. DeKyra Vernon is brought before Hamilton County Common Pleas Court Judge, Alan Triggs for her arraignment, Cincinnati, Ohio, Thursday, Aug. 14, 2025. The charges stem from a downtown beating on July 26, 2025. Devaughn is also out on bond pending trial. Aisha Devaughn is brought before Hamilton County Common Pleas Court Judge, Alan Triggs for her arraignment in Cincinnati, Ohio, Thursday, Aug. 14, 2025. The charges stem from a downtown beating on July 26, 2025. An eighth person, 45-year-old Alex Tchervinski, a victim of the brawl, has been charged with disorderly conduct related to the assault. Tchervinski can be seen in the viral video slapping one of the suspects, which his lawyer claims occurred after he had already been hit. His lawyer, Douglas Brannon, said his client was allegedly hit in the head 28 times and robbed during the attack, while trying to protect his girlfriend and another friend during the melee. "What this has done, it has made Alex a victim now for the second time by bringing criminal charges against him," Brannon told Fox News Digital. "What actually occurred is Alex was hit multiple times, before he slapped back in an attempt to try and defend himself and back off this group of thugs." Exclusive photos obtained by Fox News Channel show Alex Tchervinski's injuries from the viral beatdown in Cincinnati, Ohio on July 26, 2025. Tchervinski, who is considered a victim in the case, has been charged with disorderly conduct for his alleged role in the fight. When the FOP voted no-confidence in Pureval earlier this week, they said Aftab also ordered the city solicitor to charge a White victim of the brutal beatdown with a crime "solely to appease racial tensions at the urging of a few community leaders." "For those who want to racialize it, then a black man stepped in between the combatants, separated them and said, ‘this is about stop fighting, everybody needs to chill,'" said Lynch, who is Black. "And then, for those who want to racialize it, the white man being steps back in the ring and slaps not the black man that he had just squared up with, but slaps another black man. So after that he was met with disproportionate force." "I don't see the person who re-engaged. And so until we see all the mugshots, this is still a racial issue." "I agree with Pastor Lynch, that there is no doubt that this public safety challenge, that this incident will require further investigation, further charges and further arrests for every single person involved," he said. Police are currently searching for at least one more suspect. Fox News' Julia Bonavita contributed to this report. Previously, he was a politics reporter at The Tennessee Star.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many are parents and the sole providers for their families. But despite their contributions, immigration officials still detained them as part of President Donald Trump's massive crackdown on undocumented immigrants. Border Patrol arrests 2 crew workers helping battle Washington's biggest wildfire for being in the country illegally The arrests happened as some of these immigrants were working or commuting to and from their jobs. Here are some of the prominent community members who have been arrested by ICE in recent months: Many in the community are rallying behind Guamarrigra who, as of early August, was being held at an ICE field office in Michigan, according to CNN affiliate WLNY. Marino said the fire department volunteers are like a family and Guamarrigra was part of it. Marino said Guamarrigra immigrated to the US from Ecuador but was uncertain how long ago. Guamarrigra's family has raised more than $13,000 on GoFundMe to help pay for their legal fees “to ensure he receives a fair chance and that we can work toward bringing him home.” “The way that they took my father … they made it out to seem like he was a criminal when that's not even the case at all,” Guamarrigra's daughter, Jocelyn Guamarrigra, told WLNY. On June 14, Guevara was arrested while livestreaming law enforcement officers at a “No Kings” demonstration in the metro Atlanta area. The event was one of a few thousand held across the country that day in protest of President Donald Trump and his policies. Guevara, who came to the US from El Salvador in 2004, was charged with improperly entering a pedestrian roadway, obstruction of law enforcement officers and unlawful assembly. He was wearing a vest and press credentials at the time of his arrest. Guevara has legal authorization to work in the United States but does not hold a permanent resident card, advocates say. Guevara remains in custody despite all charges against him being dropped. Katherine Jacobsen, program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists, said the federal government's refusal to release Guevara “sends a very chilling message both to those who might be caught up in ICE actions as well as journalists … that there will be consequences if you cover this topic.” “There is no rational reason that we are aware of, that the government has made public, as to why he is continuing to be held.” Jacobsen said Guevara has three children and is the primary breadwinner for his family. One of Guevara's children relies on him for long-term medical care, according to the ACLU. Espinal built a life for himself and his family here, working in construction and volunteering as a pastor at Iglesia del Nazareno Jesus Te Ama, also known as the Church of the Nazarene Jesus Loves You, in Easton, Maryland. Espinal became known as a spiritual leader who opened up his home and provided shelter, food, coats and suits for job interviews for those in need, family friend Len Foxwell said. On July 21, ICE agents arrested the father of three for overstaying his visa. His daughter Clarissa Fuentes Diaz told CNN the arrest happened as Espinal left McDonald's and headed to a construction site to drop off some materials he bought at Lowe's. ICE confirmed Espinal's arrest to CNN last month saying in a statement he was “an illegal alien from Honduras who was arrested by ICE on July 21, in Easton, Maryland.” Espinal was released from custody on August 15 after supporters wrote dozens of letters highlighting his impact on the community and advocating for him to be freed, Foxwell said. “I believe it was a combination of the intense level of interest in the pastor's plight and his remarkable personal attributes,” Foxwell said. “If something like this can happen to somebody with his reputation and stature, then it really was a sobering reminder that it could happen to anybody and therefore nobody is safe,” Foxwell said. Espinal had spent the last decade trying to apply for a green card but faced a lot of bureaucratic red tape, according to Foxwell. Online court records in Maryland also indicate that Fuentes Espinal has no criminal history. “For those who falsely characterize these immigrants as being net takers from society, I think the experience of Pastor Fuentes Espinal reveals the lie of that mentality,” he said. “This is someone who was putting money back into the economy by earning a fair wage for a hard day's work and paying his taxes faithfully.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A class of drugs called beta-blockers — used for decades as a first-line treatment after a heart attack— doesn't benefit the vast majority of patients and may contribute to a higher risk of hospitalization and death in some women but not in men, according to groundbreaking new research. New blood pressure guidelines recommend an earlier start to treatment and skipping alcohol “These findings will reshape all international clinical guidelines on the use of beta-blockers in men and women and should spark a long-needed, sex-specific approach to treatment for cardiovascular disease,” said senior study author Dr. Valentin Fuster, president of Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital in New York City and general director of the National Center for Cardiovascular Investigation in Madrid. Women with little heart damage after their heart attacks who were treated with beta-blockers were significantly more likely to have another heart attack or be hospitalized for heart failure — and nearly three times more likely to die — compared with women not given the drug, according to a study published in the European Heart Journal and also scheduled to be presented Saturday at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Madrid. “The total number of women in the clinical trial was the largest ever included in a study testing beta-blockers after myocardial infarction (heart attack), so this is a significant finding,” said Ibáñez, a cardiologist at Madrid's Jiménez Díaz Foundation University Hospital. The findings, however, only applied to women with a left ventricular ejection fraction above 50%, which is considered normal function, the study said. Still, the drug can have unpleasant side effects, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. “The drugs can lead to low blood pressure, low heart rate, erectile dysfunction, fatigue and mood swings,” said Freeman, who was not involved in the research. Why would women be more susceptible to harm from beta-blockers than men? In fact, because early research on the heart focused on men, it took medical science years to discover that heart disease presents differently in women. Men typically have plaque buildup in their major arteries and experience more traditional signs of a heart attack such as chest pain. Women are more likely to have plaque in the heart's smaller blood vessels and can have more unusual symptoms of a heart attack such as back pain, indigestion and shortness of breath. The analysis on women was part of a much larger clinical trial called REBOOT — Treatment with Beta-Blockers after Myocardial Infarction without Reduced Ejection Fraction — which followed 8,505 men and women treated for heart attacks at 109 hospitals in Spain and Italy for nearly four years. That's likely due to advances in medication treatment such as the immediate use of stents and blood thinners after patients arrive at the hospital. In fact, most men and women who survive heart attacks today have ejection fractions above 50%, Ibáñez said. “Yet at this time, some 80% of patients in the US, Europe and Asia are treated with beta-blockers because medical guidelines still recommend them,” he said. “While we often test new drugs, it's much less common to rigorously question the continued need for older treatments.” While the study did not find any need to use beta-blockers for people with a left ventricular ejection fraction above 50% after a heart attack, a separate meta-analysis of 1,885 patients published Saturday in The Lancet did find benefits for those with scores between 40% and 50%, in which the heart may be mildly damaged. “We found about a 25% reduction in the primary endpoint, which was a composite of new heart attacks, heart failure and all-cause death.” Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple.</p>

The Trump administration is cracking down on crime in D.C. and mobilizing National Guard soldiers and airmen. Attorney General Pam Bondi fired another Department of Justice paralegal on Friday, this time for flipping off a member of the National Guard in Washington, D.C., on her way to work earlier this month. "Today, I took action to terminate a DOJ employee for inappropriate conduct towards National Guard service members in DC," Bondi told the outlet. Attorney General Pam Bondi fired another Department of Justice paralegal. "This DOJ remains committed to defending President Trump's agenda and fighting to make America safe again," she continued. "If you oppose our mission and disrespect law enforcement — you will NO LONGER work at DOJ." Later that day, Baxter was seen on DOJ security footage sticking up her middle finger at the National Guard and exclaiming, "F--k you!" She was also allegedly seen demonstrating to a department security guard how she held up her middle finger. On Aug. 25, she allegedly arrived at work and again boasted to the security guard that she hated the National Guard and that she told them to "F--k off!" Elizabeth Baxter was terminated for flipping off a member of the National Guard in Washington, D.C., on her way to work. "You are removed from your position of Paralegal Specialist, GS-0950-11, Environmental Defense Section, Environment and Natural Resources Division, and from the federal service, effective immediately," Bondi wrote in a termination letter to Baxter on Friday following an investigation into her conduct, according to the outlet. Hundreds of federal agents and National Guard troops have been deployed to D.C.'s streets. Baxter's termination comes after Sean Charles Dunn, another DOJ paralegal, was fired after he was accused of throwing a sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection agent earlier this month in Washington, D.C. Dunn, who worked in the criminal division's international affairs section in the 4CON building, was initially charged with a felony, but a grand jury declined to hand down an indictment. He was subsequently charged with a misdemeanor, which could result in up to one year in jail. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Heads of state and delegations from across Asia and the Middle East will meet from Sunday in the Chinese port city of Tianjin for the two-day summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a regional security grouping that has emerged as a cornerstone of Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin's drive to rebalance global power in their favor. The gathering also comes days ahead of a major military parade in Beijing that will offer a different message – that of China's rapidly developing military might, and draw autocrats like North Korea's Kim Jong Un and Myanmar's Min Aung Hlaing alongside Putin and Russia-friendly European leaders Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia and Slovakia's Robert Fico. The summit also gifts Russia's Putin some international spotlight, just two weeks after his Alaska summit with Trump, and as he continues to ignore international pressure to end his onslaught in Ukraine. In a written interview for Chinese state news agency Xinhua, he said they were “united in our vision of building a just, multipolar world order” – an allusion to the two countries' efforts to revise what they see as a US-led world order unfairly stacked against them. SCO members – which include China, Russia, India, Iran, Pakistan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan – preside over vast swaths of global energy reserves and govern some 40% of the global population. And while this has sparked criticism of the group as too disparate to be effective, it also may serve to underscore Xi's message. “Beijing wants to signal that China is the indispensable convener in Eurasia, capable of seating rivals at the same table and translating great-power competition into managed interdependence,” said Rabia Akhtar, director of the Centre for Security, Strategy and Policy Research at the University of Lahore in Pakistan. “The optics are straightforward: China is not just a participant in regional order-making – it is a primary architect and host.” Modi's attendance at the gathering also adds heft to Xi's guest list. The Indian prime minister skipped last year's summit in Kazakhstan. He now arrives in Tianjin against a backdrop of souring relations with Washington – and as Beijing and New Delhi have moved to ease their own frictions, a nascent realignment that could imperil US efforts to cultivate India as a counterweight against a rising China. Delegations are also expected from the SCO's 16 official partner and observer countries, which include Cambodia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, and Kuwait, as well as NATO member Turkey, among others, Chinese officials said ahead of the gathering. Beijing additionally invited a handful of Southeast Asian leaders. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is also expected to attend. The location has pointed symbolism for China, as a port that was forced open by colonial powers in the 19th century, with those from Europe and Imperial Japan receiving land concessions – and a key city occupied by Japan during World War II. Some guests, including Putin, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, are slated to stay for the military parade in Beijing, where the ruling Communist Party will show off its military might and play up its role fighting Imperial Japan as part of the Allied Forces in World War II as the globe marks 80 years since the end of that war. Since its formation in 2001 as a group focused on regional security cooperation between China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization has expanded in its size and scope. Iran's inclusion in the group in 2023 and Belarus' a year later have been widely seen as an effort by Beijing and Moscow to the make the body more explicitly anti-West. It also is one facet of a tightening of bonds between Moscow, Beijing and Tehran that's raised alarm in Washington. Now, growing frictions and uncertainties between some countries and the US under Trump will loom over the gathering – a reality sure to be referenced prominently if indirectly in remarks by Xi to his guests in the days ahead. Observers will be watching whether this summit will produce momentum toward further economic integration between member countries, especially when it comes to regional trade or development finance, but expectations for practical developments are low. “Without deeply addressing what the mission of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization should be and how it can resolve internal sources of conflict both between members and between members with external countries, the SCO is just a showcase,” said Shanghai-based foreign affairs analyst Shen Dingli. Even as the group regularly calls for “avoiding bloc, ideological or confrontational approaches” to addressing security threats, its summits have yet to produce a joint statement mentioning the war in Ukraine.</p>

Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy reports on how the Trump administration is taking credit for the lowest Labor Day gas prices in five years on ‘America Reports.' The Pentagon is standing firmly behind Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness Anthony Tata, who is facing a legal dispute in Florida connected to a self-described astrologer. Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell told Fox News that Tata continues to enjoy full confidence from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. "Under Secretary Tata has the complete and total confidence of Secretary Hegseth in his role and will continue to have his support," Parnell said. "Mr. Tata has done a fantastic job delivering on the priorities of this Department and this administration. According to a 17-page complaint filed in Palm Beach County and obtained by Fox News Digital, John Doe, whose personal details align with Tata, accused Amy Tripp of harassment, defamation and attempted extortion. The suit alleges she threatened his marriage and career while demanding money to remain silent. The filing states Doe and Tripp met in April 2024 on the dating app Bumble while Doe was working on a book and consulting about "astrological beliefs and related issues." The Pentagon is standing firmly behind its top staffer, Gen. Anthony Tata, after court filings allege involvement with a Florida astrologer. Court records show that a temporary restraining order was granted against Tripp on Aug. 7, 2025, after the alleged harassment escalated. While the Florida case unfolds, Tata's career spans decades of military and public service. A retired Army brigadier general and novelist, he spent 28 years in uniform, including service in Afghanistan. After retiring, he transitioned into civilian leadership roles, including stints in education and as North Carolina's transportation secretary. Tata, a graduate of West Point, is also a recipient of the Army Distinguished Service Medal, Defense Superior Service Medal, Legion of Merit, Combat Action Badge, Afghanistan Campaign Medal, Kosovo Campaign Medal, and Ranger Tab. His public career has not been without turbulence. Tata resigned from the transportation post in 2015, following scrutiny from his management, and his nomination for a top Pentagon role in 2020 drew attention to past social media posts as reported by CNN.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt calls her predecessor Jen Psaki's comments about the Minneapolis church shooting 'utterly disrespectful.' Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democrat-turned-Republican now serving as director of National Intelligence, is blasting former White House press secretary Jen Psaki in the wake of the Minneapolis Catholic school shooting that left two children dead and 18 others injured on Wednesday. Psaki went viral on X for her post which asserted "prayer is not freaking enough" in the wake of the tragic incident. Psaki said: "Prayer is not freaking enough. Prayers do not make parents feel safe sending their kids to school. Prayer does not bring these kids back. Her post garnered over 15 million views on X. Gabbard responded: "So why is it that people like Jen Psaki and others have such a spontaneous visceral negative reaction to those who are praying to God for refuge, strength, and for the wellbeing of the victims of this heinous attack? Because they do not believe in God or His love." They are agents of darkness and hatred, and the light of God's love is a threat to their dark ambitions." She tied her criticism to more policy causes for the Democrat Party, calling transgender rights "insanity and darkness" and citing Martin Luther King Jr.'s famous line: "Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Psaki claimed "prayer is not freaking enough" in a viral X post. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Psaki's dismissal of prayer was "utterly disrespectful" and urged her to pray for the grieving families instead. Vice President JD Vance added on X: "Why would Jen Psaki attack people for praying when those children were literally praying as they were murdered?" Minneapolis now finds itself at the center of both America's gun violence crisis and its deepening divide over how the nation mourns and seeks change. Gabbard's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. Fox News' Gabriel Hays contributed to this report.
