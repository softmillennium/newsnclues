                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Will you donate $27 to keep nonprofit journalism alive? Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testifies during a US Senate hearing for his nomination to serve as secretary of health and human services on January 29, 2025 in Washington, DC. Make America Healthy Again is "a great slogan," the senator wrote. That's how US Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee Ranking Member Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) began a New York Times op-ed on Saturday, amid mounting calls for Kennedy to leave the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), by choice or force, following the ouster of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Susan Monarez. As Sanders detailed in the Times—and a Thursday letter to Senate HELP Committee Chair Bill Cassidy (R-La.) demanding a congressional probe—Monarez was fired after reportedly refusing to "act as a rubber stamp for his dangerous policies." Her exit led to resignations and a staff walkout at the CDC, which is now being led by Jim O'Neill, a Kennedy aide and biotech investor. Sanders and other lawmakers—including former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), a polio survivor and the only Republican to vote against Kennedy's confirmation in February—have long warned about the consequences of letting RFK Jr. hold a key health policy position in President Donald Trump's second administration. "Mr. Kennedy and the rest of the Trump administration tell us, over and over, that they want to Make America Healthy Again," Sanders noted Saturday. "Despite the overwhelming opposition of the medical community, Secretary Kennedy has continued his long-standing crusade against vaccines and his advocacy of conspiracy theories that have been rejected repeatedly by scientific experts," the senator wrote. That, of course, is not just my view. "The reality is that Secretary Kennedy has profited from and built a career on sowing mistrust in vaccines. Now, as head of HHS, he is using his authority to launch a full-blown war on science, on public health, and on truth itself," he wrote, warning that in the "short term, it will be harder for Americans to get lifesaving vaccines," including for Covid. Mr. Kennedy's next target may be the childhood immunization schedule, the list of recommended vaccines that children receive to protect them from diseases like measles, chickenpox. Sanders, a leading advocate of Medicare for All, also took aim at the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Trump signed last month. "America's healthcare system is already dysfunctional and wildly expensive, and yet the Trump administration will be throwing an estimated 15 million people off their health insurance through a cut of over $1 trillion to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act," he noted. "This cut is also expected to result in the closing of or the decline in services at hundreds of nursing homes, hospitals, and community health centers. As a result of cuts to the Affordable Care Act, health insurance costs will soar for millions of Americans. "Secretary Kennedy is putting Americans' lives in danger, and he must resign," Sanders concluded. Doctors, journalists, and others praised the senator's op-ed, with Trauma surgeon Mark Hoofnagle saying that "Bernie nails it." Pennsylvania State University professor and A Desire Called America author Christian Haines wrote on the social media platform Bluesky that the piece was "clear and incisive, though I wish it didn't need to be said." Also sharing the post on Bluesky, former Times labor reporter Steven Greenhouse said: "It's delusional for anyone to think that RFK Jr. and Donald Trump are making America healthy again. With Kennedy's war against science, truth, and vaccines and Trump's war against Medicaid, their movement should be called MAKING AMERICA UNHEALTHY AGAIN."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump sported his go-to golf outfit for the trip in Virginia - black pants, a white polo shirt and his signature red MAGA hat. His appearance comes after unfounded rumors circulated online claiming Trump was sick or even had died - with the hashtag '#whereistrump' going viral on Friday. The speculation began after several White House reporters noted the president had not been seen in public since a marathon cabinet meeting on Tuesday and had no events scheduled all weekend. And the unfounded rumors went into overdrive after Vice President JD Vance told USA Today he was ready to step in for Trump if 'If there's a terrible tragedy'. The rumors were also fanned by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who asked people to pray for Trump as he claimed without evidence, that the president was in a 'health crisis,' and looked like he was about to 'collapse'. The speculation began after several White House reporters noted the president had not been seen in public since a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, pictured But the rumors were quashed by Axios journalist Barak Ravid who revealed a US official had confirmed the president is in good health. 'Trump is OK. Will play Golf this morning,' Ravid wrote on X shortly before images emerged of the president and his granddaughter. On Wednesday, he had a meeting with his son-in-law Jared Kushner, former British prime minister Tony Blair and Israeli official Ron Dermer to discuss a post-war plan for Gaza. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt revealed in July that the president was suffering from 'chronic venous insufficiency,' that was causing 'mild swelling' in his lower legs. The president's physician revealed in an memo that his condition was, 'a benign and common condition' in elderly people, but that there was no evidence of any serious arterial disease. People with the condition often are advised to lose weight, walk for exercise and elevate their legs periodically, and some may be advised to wear compression stockings. Severe cases over time can lead to complications including lower leg sores called ulcers. Blood clots are one cause, but was ruled out, Leavitt said. Karoline Leavitt said that Trump has been diagnosed with 'chronic venous insufficiency' The White House disclosed in July that President Donald Trump was checked out by his doctor after noticeable 'swelling' on his hands and legs Despite the conspiracy theories surrounding his health, Trump's Truth Social account was active on Friday when he issued a statement about tariffs after a federal appeals court ruled Friday that President Trump had no legal right to impose sweeping tariffs Today a Highly Partisan Appeals Court incorrectly said that our Tariffs should be removed, but they know the United States of America will win in the end. If these Tariffs ever went away, it would be a total disaster for the Country. It would make us financially weak, and we have to be strong. By posting your comment you agree to our house rules.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bobby Singer, indelibly played by Jim Beaver, was a gruff and cynical, but loyal retired demon hunter and father figure not only to Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles), but many other hunters through the years. Convention Memories: “There have been wacky things that happened. And then there's finding out that someone has tattooed your face on their upper arm so that their armpit hair forms your beard! And to my surprise, many said they would watch even if there were no monsters. People have come up to me with tears in their eyes telling me how the show had a strong emotional impact on their lives. “It was a fun episode, and fans got to see another angle on the show. Finding Out Bobby Would Die: Of the moment he learned his character's fate, Beaver told us, “I learned I would die from the showrunners Bob Singer (my character is named after him) and Sera Gamble, who said, ‘We're going to kill you, but you're coming back as a ghost.' It was very much like being a kid at the best summer camp. There were times I wondered how we got the show shot in eight days per episode because we were having so much fun. I am also so grateful for the show giving me a connection with Terry Ann Fleming, who played Bobby's wife. “When I knew that Bobby's house was going to be demolished. I took home a little ceramic frog that was on Bobby's kitchen counter, and it's still in my house. Also, Jared stole a set of three little brass owls that I think he wanted for himself, but somebody suggested that I might like a souvenir, and he gave me the brass owls. When I first showed up on the set and I saw all the books, I thought, ‘I'm probably going to end up stealing a lot of these books, but about half of them weren't real books and the other half were on obscure Canadian land deals,” he said. If There Were an Afterlife for Bobby: The actor imagined, “We last saw Bobby in Heaven with Sam and Dean, so maybe there's a problem in Heaven that I have to tend to. Or maybe there's a new alternate universe where we all start over. If the same team talent would do another Supernatural round in some form, I would be ecstatic to be part of it.” What He Hears from Fans: Instead of saying something to me, they ask me to say something — usually ‘Idjit' or ‘Balls,'” Beaver explained. What Supernatural meant to him: “Being on a show for 15 years is an extraordinary achievement. To be a central part of that for all those years really felt like, ‘Okay, I've done something with my life.' I had toiled in the vineyards of Hollywood for a long, long time, until these two shows, Deadwood and Supernatural, suddenly put me in a place where people knew who I was. That period in the early 2000s was a major shift in my career for which I am eternally grateful because it led me to opportunities that I never would have had otherwise,” Beaver said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"When in doubt, go to a psychic," she quipped Hairspray fans almost missed out on watching Brittany Snow play Amber Von Tussle in the 2007 musical. According to Snow, her audition to play the bratty daughter of Velma Von Tussle, portrayed by Michelle Pfeiffer, didn't go as planned, but she was determined to fight for the role after remembering what a psychic once told her. Adam Shankman, the director of Hairspray, he called me and he was like, 'Well, that wasn't great,'" she reflected. I got really nervous and my voice cracked." Although she did "pretty well at the dancing," which was crucial to Amber's role as the lead female dancer on The Corny Collins Show, Snow admitted it was not enough to compensate for her "awful" singing audition. "[Shankman] said to me, 'You know, what's really funny? We just got Michelle Pfeiffer connected to play Velma Von Tussle. That was the lightning bolt that reminded Snow of a previous conversation she had with a psychic. Two years prior, a psychic told her that she "was going to be in a huge movie with an iconic, beautiful blonde woman playing my mother." Following this realization, Snow decided to call Shankman back and plead for a second chance.

"He will attest to this because it's such a crazy story," Snow said. And I know this sounds insane, but the psychic told me that I'm going to play Michelle Pfeiffer's daughter, basically.' Although Snow believed he might have felt bad for her, she went ahead and auditioned again and "nailed it." So when in doubt, go to a psychic," she quipped.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When people hear the name Jeffrey Epstein, they usually think of scandal, crimes, and powerful connections. At the time of his death in 2019, Epstein's estate was valued at nearly $600 million, yet few clear records explain how a former prep school teacher and Wall Street trader built such vast wealth. What is known is that a handful of billionaire clients—most notably retail magnate Leslie Wexner and private equity tycoon Leon Black—paid him extraordinary sums for tax and estate planning. Beyond that, Epstein's opaque businesses, offshore dealings, and questionable associations leave lingering questions about what was really going on behind the scenes. After a short stint as a math teacher at New York's Dalton School, Epstein moved to Wall Street in the 1970s, working as an options trader and later as a limited partner at Bear Stearns. In the early 1980s, he launched his own wealth management business, eventually operating out of the U.S. Virgin Islands, where secrecy laws shielded many details of his work. According to The New York Times, Epstein marketed himself as a math whiz and “financial doctor” who specialized in helping the wealthy reduce their tax bills. Epstein's most famous client was Leslie Wexner, the billionaire retail magnate behind Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works. What made their relationship unusual was that Wexner gave Epstein power of attorney—legal authority to make financial and business decisions on his behalf. That is an extraordinary level of trust to place in someone with what was then a relatively short professional track record. Another major client was Leon Black, co-founder of Apollo Global Management, who paid Epstein more than $150 million for tax and estate planning advice. Those payments were far higher than what wealthy individuals typically spend on such services, raising further questions about why clients would pay Epstein such a premium for his work. He was arrested again on federal sex-trafficking charges in July 2019, but died by suicide in a Manhattan jail a month later while awaiting trial. Most successful money managers operate with some degree of transparency—meaning clients, regulators, and sometimes the public can see how their firms earn fees and manage investments. His company operated in the Virgin Islands, where it's okay for people like Epstein to keep their financial dealings secret. Aside from his connections to Wexner and Black, Epstein rarely disclosed other clients or the services he provided. This lack of visibility, combined with unusually large fees and his personal control over Wexner's fortune, has led many observers to wonder whether Epstein's financial dealings went beyond standard money management. Epstein's unusual relationship with Wexner was central to his wealth. Within a few years of meeting, the billionaire granted Epstein the power to manage his businesses and finances as he saw fit. He also reportedly gifted Epstein a lavish $77 million townhouse in New York City, and other perks, including the use of a private jet. Epstein labeled himself a financier—someone who manages large sums of money for wealthy clients, typically focusing on investments, tax strategies, and estate planning. In Epstein's case, that meant handling billions for clients like Wexner. Epstein was also linked to Towers Financial, a company later exposed as one of the largest Ponzi schemes in U.S. history. A Ponzi scheme is a type of fraud in which money from new investors is used to pay earlier investors, creating the illusion of real profits when none exist. A list of every investment he made isn't available, although we do know that the largest asset held by his estate, as of July 2025, was two funds managed by Valar Ventures, a firm co-founded by Peter Thiel that specializes in providing startup capital to financial technology companies. Starting in the late 1990s, Epstein set up companies there that qualified for the territory's Economic Development Program, which offered massive tax cuts—up to a 90% cut in corporate income tax and full exemptions from some local taxes. Epstein reportedly saved more than $300 million in taxes between 1999 and 2018 from the program, allowing him to keep far more of his earnings than he would have on the U.S. mainland. Epstein died a wealthy man, with an estate worth nearly $600 million. He built that fortune, it seems, primarily from fees earned from just a few clients, as well as tax breaks that saved him several hundred million over two decades.

Finally, you may have heard a lot about radioactive shrimp recently. We explore why frozen seafood glows in the dark. Now, Africa is leading the charge to get rid of it for good. Last week, the African Union, a continental union of 55 member states, endorsed a campaign to replace the Mercator map with an alternative map that more accurately reflects the size of Africa (just wait until you see it). Scientists toying with the afterglow of phosphor particles were stunned to see how uniformly they could diffuse across succulent plants when injected into their leaves. In a new attempt to narrow down what the famous "Wow!" Signal might be, a team of scientists re-analyzed decades of data from the Big Ear telescope using modern signal analysis techniques, as well as analyzing data that had previously been unpublished, producing two not-yet-peer-reviewed papers on the topic. Their findings concluded that it likely has an extraterrestrial origin after all, and may have been even more intense than previously believed. New fossils have revealed that an ankylosaur known as Spicomellus afer was covered in enormous spikes that were fused to its bones, some almost a meter (3.3 feet) long. In 1978, while inspecting a faulty detector inside the Soviet Union's most powerful particle accelerator, physicist Anatoli Bugorski was struck in the head by a proton beam traveling close to the speed of light. Amazingly, Bugorski remains alive to this day, and while government secrecy prevented details of his medical assessment from being leaked, researchers have now reconstructed the path that the high-energy ray blazed through his brain. The advent of refrigeration and freezing has meant we can now store food in our houses until we're ready to eat it. Perishable items like prawns can sit snuggly in the dark of our freezer, waiting until it's their time to shine – only, some of that seafood might already be glowing without you knowing.
