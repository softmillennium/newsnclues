                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tenth seed Lorenzo Musetti led 24th seed and close friend Flavio Cobolli 6-3, 6-2, 2-0 in the third round of the US Open Saturday when Cobolli retired due to injury. “Honestly I didn't want to finish like that, especially against Flavio, who is probably my best friend on Tour,” Musetti said. Musetti arrived at the US Open having lost five of his previous six matches, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. But since losing his first set of the season's final major to big-serving Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, the Italian has been nearly flawless to reach the second week. The 23-year-old Nitto ATP Finals hopeful broke Cobolli's serve five times and will next face Zizou Bergs or Jaume Munar. He leads Bergs 1-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, but trails Munar 1-2. “It's a bittersweet match and a bittersweet end, but of course I'm happy to be in the fourth round for the first time,” Musetti said. Of course Flavio, I could see that from the second set he was struggling a bit, but it was still tough to play against him and I wish him the best of luck to recover soon and to be healthy again.” This year's Bucharest and Hamburg champion, who received treatment during the clash on his arm, made clear he wanted to congratulate Musetti on his performance before revealing more about his injury. "I had some cramps the other two matches in my fingers and also in my hand, but I played without any problem," Cobolli said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Six years after upsetting Simona Halep on Arthur Ashe Stadium, Taylor Townsend pulled off another Top 5 upset at the US Open, knocking out Mirra Andreeva to reach the fourth round for a second time. Constantly moving forward and attacking, taking Andreeva out of her rhythm and serving impeccably, Townsend cruised to her third career Top 10 win, the first in more than two years. US Open: Draws | Scores | Order of play The postmatch handshake -- it was really just a meeting of hands -- passed quickly without incident. “This feels good,” Townsend said in her on-court interview, clearly meaning it. The 29-year-old American is more celebrated for her doubles play -- she's ranked No. 1 and is the reigning Australian Open champion with Katerina Siniakova. But Townsend pulled off her first Top 10 win here six years ago, upsetting Simona Halep en route to the fourth round (losing to eventual champion Bianca Andreescu). She has impressed with her singles play this summer, advancing to the quarterfinals in Washington, D.C., as a qualifier and the third round in Cincinnati. In New York, Townsend beat Antonia Ruzic and No. 25 seed Jelena Ostapenko to reach the third round before notching her third career Top 10 win over Andreeva. To Townsend, the circumstances this year were totally unlike her 2019 breakthrough. "I just felt like it helped validate me as a player, and then I was able to continue, and then I ended up losing to Bianca in three sets and she ended up winning the tournament. "This time it just feels completely different. I was so confident and so sure of myself and what I was doing and how I was executing, that it didn't matter if I hit the back fence, hit the bottom of the net, it didn't matter. That's what's really cool about tennis in these moments, you're able to reflect and look even at the mannerisms and how I carried myself then and now, you'll be able to see it's a different woman." Townsend will play two-time major champion Barbora Krejcikova, a 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 winner over No. 10 Emma Navarro in a fourth-round match on Sunday. They're frequent rivals on the doubles court -- Krejcikova and Siniakova defeated Townsend and Caty McNally in the 2022 US Open final, and Krejcikova leads the doubles head-to-head 4-1 -- but have only met once in singles. On Wednesday night, after losing to Townsend 7-5, 6-1, Ostapenko confronted her at the net, clearly agitated and questioning her conduct and character. Townsend, to her credit, took the high road. “There's no beef on my side,” she said. But you're not going to insult me, especially after I carried myself a certain type of way with nothing but respect. "I had doubles the next day," Townsend said. When I step into those gates, nothing that's happening on the outside matters ... "I also really took the time to be intentional. In the morning I cut it off. And that's what I think is a testament to being professional, being able to block out what's on the outside and when you step in the lines you handle business." Daniil Medvedev was fined $42,500 for unsportsmanlike conduct and racket abuse following his first-round loss. Stefanos Tsitsipas confronted Daniel Altmaier about his underarm serving after a second-round loss. After moving into the fourth round, No. 4 seed Jessica Pegula was asked about the unusual rash of post-match outbursts. “My matches have been pretty no drama, so I'm not really sure what's going on with everybody else. “I feel like the crowds, they're pretty crazy. They kind of get everyone riled up. On Friday, it was Townsend who competed stronger. The first set, a rollicking affair, featured two early breaks of serve and, at 5-all, a third by Townsend. She served it out, finishing with a 109 mph serve that was not returned. Andreeva came out fast in the second, breaking Townsend for a 2-0 lead, but just as swiftly it was 2-all. Townsend converted her second break point for 3-2 when Andreeva dropped a backhand into the net. With Townsend leading 4-2, for the third straight time, Andreeva fell behind love-40 on her serve. But after clawing back to deuce, Townsend took advantage of a double fault and stroked a forehand pass for her fifth straight game that gave her an insurmountable 5-2 lead. Afterward, Townsend thanked her coach John Williams and four-year-old son Adyn Aubrey. You guys saw the real Taylor Townsend tonight. Six years after upsetting Simona Halep on Arthur Ashe Stadium, Taylor Townsend pulled off another Top 5 upset at the US Open, knocking out Mirra Andreeva to reach the fourth round for a second time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic finally has his teeth into the 2025 US Open. After two unremarkable wins that drew more attention for his conditioning than his form, Djokovic produced a sharp 6-4, 6-7(4), 6-2, 6-3 victory over a competitive Cameron Norrie Friday night, albeit after more early-match drama surrounding his fitness. “Yeah, it's all right,” Djokovic said coyly when asked about his back during his on-court interview. “You have some ups and downs… You don't want to reveal too much to the rivals listening and watching this interview. Even if you're feeling something body-wise, the energy that you're feeling in this court just overrides it.” The seventh seed played a lights-out first set in which he dropped just two points on serve and hit 17 winners, but an off-court medical time-out after the ninth game had fans inside Arthur Ashe Stadium concerned about his prospects. The four-time US Open champion grabbed at his lower back late in the first set after an awkward movement at net to reflex back a ball that was above and behind his head. Before lining up to serve for the set at 5-4, the 38-year-old walked off Arthur Ashe Stadium to receive treatment in the locker room from ATP physio Clay Sniteman. Djokovic hit 51 of his own, including 18 aces, a personal best at Flushing Meadows. In the fourth round Djokovic will face German Jan-Lennard Struff, who upset 2024 semi-finalist Frances Tiafoe 6-4, 6-3, 7-6(7). The seven-time Nitto ATP Finals champion, who has spent 428 weeks as World No. 1 during his career, is seeded to meet Taylor Fritz in the quarter-finals and Carlos Alcaraz in the semi-finals. Djokovic won his 24th and most recent major at Flushing Meadows in 2023. 34 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, slipped to 0-11 against Top 10 players at the majors and 0-7 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series against Djokovic. Fourth seed Fritz also had to navigate a tricky match, battling past Swiss qualifier Jerome Kym 7-6(3), 6-7(9), 6-4, 6-4 in two hours and 58 minutes. “I've done a great job of just battling through these matches where it's easy to get frustrated, certain shots aren't working, maybe I'm not playing the level that I want to play,” Fritz said. The defending finalist has now needed four sets in consecutive matches, but he delivered 20 aces against Kym and lost serve just once to avoid too much trouble. He will next take on 21st seed Tomas Machac, a 7-5, 6-3, 6-1 winner against Frenchman Ugo Blanchet earlier in the day.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Karolina Muchova loves playing in New York, and she provided an inside look at how she spends her time, and how she gets her energy, when she's in the city for the US Open. 13 has reached the semifinals in Queens each of the past two years, and she always gets to celebrate her birthday in Manhattan. (It falls on August 21, just before the start of main-draw play.) Now 29, Muchova prefers a calmer New York stay than when she played this tournament in her younger years: less of the glitz and more of the serenity (there is some in New York, believe it or not) and unique surroundings, like a casual morning stroll in Central Park with a cup of coffee. "I really love the park," she says. I love to walk there, take a coffee and just sit there on a rock and think, look at people." But fewer "party places" certainly doesn't mean less fun. The former French Open finalist went to the Lady Gaga show at Madison Square Garden -- "It was unreal, I'm still recovering," she says -- and she often gets to a Broadway show, something she plans to do after her US Open run ends. And then there's the annual birthday dinner with friends -- this year it was Italian food -- that helps get her in the right frame of mind before the tournament begins. She's explored different neighborhoods throughout the years, but feels most at peace uptown, in the shadow of the iconic 843-acre park that one can never get tired of exploring. "Last year I stayed close to Flatiron," Muchova says. They're more, I would say, chill and [have] good shopping. Playing against Venus Williams, on Arthur Ashe Stadium, is hardly a breezy first round. "It was for sure unique," Muchova said, "and it was special to play Venus on her home court. I could feel that the people were a lot on her side, and you're just there trying to do your best. It's a first match, so you kind of never know how you're gonna come to your first match. But in the end I managed to  focus on a third set, and I was just happy to get through. Every win is good for the confidence." Her second-round match wasn't much easier. Competing against the fierce wind -- it was actually chilly in the late afternoon on Thursday -- and an experienced veteran in Sorana Cirstea, Muchova followed a similarly stressful path to victory, dropping the second set after winning the first before closing it out 7-6 (0), 6-7 (3), 6-4. "The fact that I love to play here helps," she says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ben Shelton's US Open came to an end in the third round on Friday when he was forced to retire against Adrian Mannarino with the score level at two sets apiece. After saving a break point, the 22-year-old American signalled distress to his father and coach Bryan Shelton. Although he did hold serve, he was forced to take a medical timeout three points into the ensuing game, later claiming to his box that it was the “worst pain I've ever felt in my life”. The result is a huge blow for Shelton, who was aiming to strengthen his push for American No. 1, currently held by last year's finalist and World No. Amid a career-best season, highlighted by winning his first ATP Masters 1000 title in Toronto earlier this month, Shelton is fourth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin and hoping to make his debut at the Nitto ATP Finals in November. A potential blockbuster quarter-final clash with Carlos Alcaraz was also looming for Shelton, who achieved his best result in New York in 2023 before falling to eventual champion Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals. “When he started to have pain, he was leading in the match,” Mannarino said in his on-court interview. “Honestly, he probably would've won that match. I don't really know what to say right now. Not the way we wanted it to end... Into the US Open fourth round for the first time in his career, Mannarino will face a maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with 20th seed Jiri Lehecka, who earlier eased past Raphael Collignon 6-4, 6-4, 6-4. Prior to reaching the Wimbledon third round in June, Mannarino had just two tour-level wins to his name in 2025 and was as low as World No. The 37-year-old has since made the fourth round in Cincinnati, where he tested Jannik Sinner in two tight sets, and has climbed to No. “There's always new things coming up and I'm just enjoying my time on the court. Before Shelton was forced to retire for the first time in his tour-level career, Mannarino tested the recent Toronto champion through four gripping sets. The Frenchman pulled the sixth seed away from his tradition first-strike brand of tennis and into entertaining baseline rallies. But after three hours and seven minutes, took the advice from his father Bryan to end the match. “I was having good fun on the court, there were some really long rallies,” said Mannarino. “I was losing some, winning some, but I think it was a really cool match to play. Ben is playing really well, he kicked my ass at the beginning of the summer, but it was a great match. Jan-Lennard Struff upset two-time US Open semi-finalist Frances Tiafoe 6-4, 6-3, 7-6(7) to reach the fourth round in New York for the first time and equal his best result at a major tournament. Tiafoe, who was defeated by countryman Fritz in last year's semi-final, has dropped 12 spots to No. 29 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings following his third-round exit. 10 leaves New York with a 26-19 record on the season. “I think everybody knows it's tough to serve out a match,” Struff said in his on-court interview. Having come through qualifying to reach the fourth round, Struff awaits a clash with four-time winner Novak Djokovic or British No. No part of this site may be reproduced, stored in a retrieval system or transmitted in any way or by any means (including photocopying, recording or storing it in any medium by electronic means), without the written permission of ATP Tour, Inc..</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was a day built around former major winners challenging the current elite, with Marketa Vondrousova and Jessica Pegula delivering victories over Jasmine Paolini and Victoria Azarenka. NEW YORK -- Friday's schedule at the US Open offered a rare thread: three recent Grand Slam winners, no longer among the top-ranked players, crossing paths with Top 10 seeds. As it turned out, two Czech Republic players who have been battling injuries were able to channel their past glories. 7 seed Jasmine Paolini in straight sets, while Barbora Krejcikova was a 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 winner over No. 10 Emma Navarro in a dramatic match that ran 2 hours and 30 minutes. The only Top 10 seed to take out a former Slam winner? 4 Jessica Pegula, who defeated two-time Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka. Vondrousova, who has been termed “tricky” and “crafty” can sometimes be difficult to solve. She's a clever lefty who likes to slice the ball -- but also has the ability to rip an ace right past you. Two years ago, that diverse toolbox carried her to the title at Wimbledon. Vondrousova's fourth-round match is against another recent Wimbledon champion, Elena Rybakina, who was an emphatic 6-1, 6-2 winner over Emma Raducanu. “She's playing great tennis and won easily today,” Vondrousova said of Rybakina. “It's incredible to be here again and play good tennis.” Vondrousova is now 2-0 against Paolini and this was her 15th career victory over a Top 10 player. The first-set tiebreak was a tutorial in variety. Vondrousova mixed in a healthy dose of slices and finished points by switching back to topspin, while Paolini lost four of her five service points. Up 6-2, Vondrousova converted her third set point when Paolini missed a backhand long, her scream showing how much it meant. Vondrousova finally converted her sixth break point when a Paolini backhand stab sailed long -- leading to another scream. “It was a very important game,” Vondrousova said. Vondrousova won 48 of her 70 service points and was unbroken. Paolini, who was broken twice, is now 18-4 in majors when up against players outside the Top 50. She was attempting to become the first Italian woman to reach back-to-back fourth rounds at the US Open since Roberta Vinci in 2016. It came after a string of six straight losses in major quarterfinals. Friday's 6-1, 7-5 win in Arthur Ashe Stadium came over two-time Australian Open champion Azarenka. “Last year this place was really special,” Pegula said in her on-court interview. “I had some amazing moments on this court. My results weren't that amazing the last couple of months, so being able to turn it around really quickly was awesome.” Next up for Pegula is the winner of the later match between Australian qualifier Priscilla Hon and Ann Li. It's been a dozen years since Azarenka defended her title at the Australian Open, those back-to-back victories representing the crowning glory of her career. But in one of her favorite cities, she put together back-to-back main-draw wins for the first time since last year's US Open, defeating qualifier Hina Inoue in the first round and then No. The two, who practice together often in Florida, embraced at net. Pegula, who converted six of 15 break points against Azarenka, now holds a 4-3 head-to-head advantage. “We know each other's games so well,” Pegula said. Back in July, Navarro spoiled Krejcikova's Wimbledon title defense with a three-set, third-round victory. On Friday night, the two-time major champion returned the favor, coming back to defeat Navarro 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 in a streaky and entertaining Grandstand match in New York. “It definitely was a huge match for me,” Krejcikova said afterward. After coming in with an 8-6 record, Krejcikova has put together three straight wins. The reaction says it all!A hard-fought victory for Barbora and her team 💪 pic.twitter.com/fXxQTyI2NR She had reached the fourth round in five of her past six majors. The match came to a head with Krejcikova serving at 4-3. Navarro forged a pair of break points, but the Czech player fought them off with an unreturnable serve and bigger groundstrokes. Two backhand errors, forced by deep shots, gave Krejcikova that decisive game. Krejcikova won the battle of service breaks, seven to six. She consistently hit bigger, as evidenced by her 33 winners and 53 unforced errors. It was a day built around former major winners challenging the current elite, with Marketa Vondrousova and Jessica Pegula delivering victories over Jasmine Paolini and Victoria Azarenka.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ugo Blanchet remembers the moment he needed to make a change. 900 is already a good level of tennis. Blanchet may deliver that story in a slightly light-hearted manner, but it is a fitting anecdote that helps summarise his tennis journey so far. He had already turned 26 when he made his Grand Slam main-draw debut in May at Roland Garros, making him a late bloomer in comparison to the majority of his peers. Despite that long wait, he holds no regrets. “I think everybody has their own path,” said Blanchet. “Mine has been longer, because I was not very professional in my approach to practising and playing. Last week, Blanchet's girlfriend and parents were in New York to watch him drop just one set across three qualifying matches at the US Open. They have all since had to return to France for work, but he remains well-supported at Flushing Meadows by his coach, former World No. Three days later, he stunned the fast-rising #NextGenATP Czech Jakub Mensik in a five-set thriller. A memorable moment, but Blanchet is eager for more. “My first one in five sets and my first time into the third round of a Grand Slam, and first win against a Top 20 player. I need to prove it multiple times against these players to say that my level is really high and that I can compete with these guys the whole year.” Blanchet earned the biggest win of his career against World No. Competing in New York as the World No. 184, Blanchet's off-court passions include following French football powerhouse Olympique de Marseille, while he also identifies himself as a huge ‘Potterhead'. "I am a big fan of Harry Potter. I went to London to visit the studios and I've read all the books in French, and in English to learn [the language better]," said Blanchet. "I think they are better in English, but because of my [reading] level, I prefer them in French.” Blanchet's time so far this summer in New York has been all about tennis, however, and he will head into his third-round meeting with 21st seed Tomas Machac flying high with confidence. Should the Frenchman win, he will surpass his career high of No. “The journey has been good,” said Blanchet, reflecting on his five wins so far in New York. I have good confidence in my game so I'm happy to come here and get some victories.

But the emotions of these moments, it is really theatrical. “I'm sure this is going to be a pivot point for her with her serve … she is inspirational.” ❤️We react to Coco Gauff's emotional win against Donna Vekic. Lindsay Davenport called Gauff's mid-match emotions “heartbreaking” as the reigning Roland Garros champion struggled to employ changes made by biomechanic coach Gavin MacMillan, an expert hired after Gauff's serving woes carried throughout the US Open swing.MacMillan famously reworked the serve of Aryna Sabalenka, who went on to win three Grand Slam titles and rise to her current spot as world No. MacMillan famously reworked the serve of Aryna Sabalenka, who went on to win three Grand Slam titles and rise to her current spot as world No. “It seems like everyone's got to take a step back and just say, ‘You know what? Go try and figure out this last major of the year. '”In her visit to the TC Live desk, Martina Navratilova is also waiting for Gauff to exhale, the 18-time Grand Slam champion questioning the wisdom of attempting a technical overhaul in the midst of a major tournament.“If you're trying something new and you have no idea how it's going to turn out, especially when you don't have any confidence, you really need to do it in a quiet space,” advised Navratilova. “I don't want anybody watching me except my coach and the cameras doing the video so I can figure it out.” In her visit to the TC Live desk, Martina Navratilova is also waiting for Gauff to exhale, the 18-time Grand Slam champion questioning the wisdom of attempting a technical overhaul in the midst of a major tournament.“If you're trying something new and you have no idea how it's going to turn out, especially when you don't have any confidence, you really need to do it in a quiet space,” advised Navratilova. “I don't want anybody watching me except my coach and the cameras doing the video so I can figure it out.” “I don't want anybody watching me except my coach and the cameras doing the video so I can figure it out.” The four-time US Open singles champion talked through some of her favorite memories in New York on Friday's "TC Live at the US Open. Chanda Rubin was more optimistic about Gauff's chances in Flushing Meadows, noting the 2023 champion's marked improvements in the second set versus Vekic, and from a tense first-round against Ajla Tomljanovic.“Overall, this was not a bad match in terms of numbers,” said Rubin, a 1996 Australian Open semifinalist. I'm sure this is going to be a pivot point with her serve, and it's going to be something she will ultimately put behind her. But the emotions of these moments, it is really theatrical. “I think we saw, again, how impressive Gauff is, the fact that she was able to turn that first set around. She was able to dig in and somehow win it. At times, she was visibly shaking during the changeovers and it was just so incredible how she, once again, dug in and didn't let the moment overwhelm her completely. Getting that first set was huge and she was able to run away with the second set in the end.”Gauff will be back on court on Saturday when she takes on No.</p>
