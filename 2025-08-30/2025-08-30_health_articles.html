                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Beta blockers-drugs commonly prescribed for a range of cardiac conditions, including heart attacks-provide no clinical benefit for patients who have had an uncomplicated myocardial infarction with preserved heart function. This is a breakthrough discovery from the "REBOOT Trial" with senior investigator Valentin Fuster, MD, PhD, President of Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital and General Director of Spain's Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC). The study results, which could overturn a standard treatment paradigm, were presented on Saturday, August 30, during a "Hot Line" session at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Madrid, and simultaneously published in The New England Journal of Medicine. Additionally, a REBOOT substudy, published Saturday, August 30, in the European Heart Journal, shows that women treated with beta blockers had a higher risk of death, heart attack, or hospitalization for heart failure compared to women not receiving the drug. This trial will reshape all international clinical guidelines. It joins other previous landmark trials led by CNIC and Mount Sinai-such as SECURE with the polypill and DapaTAVI, with SLT2 inhibition associated to TAVI-that have already transformed some global approaches to cardiovascular disease." Dr. Valentin Fuster, MD, PhD, President of Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital and General Director of Spain's Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares The SECURE trial showed a polypill, a single pill that that combines three medications - which contains aspirin, ramipril, and atorvastatin – reduces cardiovascular events by 33 percent in patients treated with this after a heart attack. "REBOOT will change clinical practice worldwide," says Principal Investigator Borja Ibáñez, MD, CNIC's Scientific Director, who presented the results. "Currently, more than 80 percent of patients with uncomplicated myocardial infarction are discharged on beta blockers. Although generally considered safe, beta blockers can cause side effects such as fatigue, bradycardia (low heart rate), and sexual dysfunction. For more than 40 years, beta blockers have been prescribed as a standard treatment after a heart attack, but their benefit in the context of modern treatments was unproven. Researchers enrolled 8,505 patients across 109 hospitals in Spain and Italy. The results showed no significant differences between the two groups in rates of death, recurrent heart attack, or hospitalization for heart failure. A REBOOT subgroup analysis found that women treated with beta blockers experienced more adverse events. The elevated risk when treated with beta-blockers was restricted to women with a complete normal cardiac function after a heart attack (left ventricular ejection fraction of 50 percent or higher). Those with a mild deterioration in cardiac function did not have an excess risk of adverse outcomes when treated with beta-blockers. "After a heart attack, patients are typically prescribed multiple medications, which can make adherence difficult," explains Dr. Ibáñez. "Beta blockers were added to standard treatment early on because they significantly reduced mortality at the time. Their benefits were linked to reduced cardiac oxygen demand and arrhythmia prevention. Today, occluded coronary arteries are reopened rapidly and systematically, drastically lowering the risk of serious complications such as arrhythmias. While we often test new drugs, it's much less common to rigorously question the continued need for older treatments." "The trial was designed to optimize heart attack care based on solid scientific evidence and without commercial interests. These results will help streamline treatment, reduce side effects, and improve quality of life for thousands of patients every year," Dr. Ibanez adds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Like bees breathing life into gardens, providing pollen and making flowers blossom, little cellular machines called mitochondria breathe life into our bodies, buzzing with energy as they produce the fuel that powers each of our cells. Maintaining mitochondrial metabolism requires input from many molecules and proteins-some of which have yet to be discovered. Salk Institute researchers are taking a closer look at whether mitochondria rely on microproteins-small proteins that have been difficult to find and, consequently, underestimated for their role in health and disease. Here we reveal that a microprotein is responsible for preserving mitochondrial structure and function in brown fat tissue, which regulates body temperature and energy balance." Alan Saghatelian, senior author, professor and Dr. Frederik Paulsen Chair at Salk In the late spring of 2024, Saghatelian's lab discovered the genetic code for SLC35A4-MP hidden in an upstream open reading frame on a strand of messenger RNA (mRNA). The longstanding belief was that each mRNA strand codes for a single protein-a one-to-one ratio of mRNA-to-protein, always. So, when scientists found additional sections of genetic material- upstream open reading frames-on mRNA strands, they thought they must be either 1) random noncoding junk or 2) regulatory code that influences the translation of that mRNA. But as genetic probing and sequencing technology became more sophisticated, researchers soon realized some of those upstream open reading frames coded for functional microproteins. This discovery brought an entirely new dimension to cellular life, as microproteins long hidden in disregarded upstream open reading frames are now in full bloom-ready to be plucked and studied. Some of the first functional microproteins to be described were involved in metabolism and mitochondrial regulation. Further tests suggested the microprotein might be helping maintain healthy cellular metabolism. "SLC35A4-MP is among the first microproteins to be functionally characterized in mice," says first author Andréa Rocha, a postdoctoral researcher in Saghatelian's lab. To classify SLC35A4-MP, the researchers looked at an exemplary metabolic tissue that works its mitochondria especially hard: brown fat. Brown fat cells are metabolically demanding, as they regulate energy balance and body temperature. The researchers removed SLC35A4-MP entirely from mouse brown fat cells, then induced metabolically stressful events like cold exposure or a high-fat diet. Without SLC35A4-MP, mice were unable to dial up their metabolism during cold exposure. Their mitochondria were structurally compromised, enlarged, dysfunctional, and inflamed. SLC35A4-MP could be a powerful therapeutic target for any disease or disorder that impacts metabolic and mitochondrial function, from obesity to aging and beyond. Microprotein research is finally springing to life, and the team sees bright blooms ahead in the search for more functional microproteins. "As scientists have been able to add more microproteins to our protein databases, the question has remained, do these microproteins have any physiological relevance?" "And our study says yes, they are important physiological regulators. I hope that adds more fuel to the study of microproteins moving forward."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists in the field often liken it to an antenna. This slender, microscopic appendage juts out from the surface of most cells in the human body - and yet for many years, it was completely missing from textbook illustrations. Scientists began paying more attention to primary cilia around 2003. Since then, this antenna-like organelle has become a hot topic for research, in part because defects in primary cilia can lead to a whole host of medical problems - everything from hearing loss and cleft palate to having one's internal organs located on the wrong side of the body. In a new paper published this week in Science, MSK developmental biologists Yinwen Liang, PhD, and Alexandra Joyner, PhD, report that they have solved part of the mystery: Two transcription factors, SP5 and SP8, act as a kind of on-off switch for the initiation of cilium formation. In cells without a primary cilium, turning these genes on can cause them to build one. The results have immediate and long-term implications for the understanding and treatment of diseases caused by missing or malfunctioning primary cilia - called ciliopathies - which affect 1 in 2,000 people worldwide. When Dr. Liang, a senior scientist in the Joyner Lab and formerly a postdoc fellow in Kathryn Anderson's lab, first started thinking about why some cell types have primary cilia and others don't, she suspected it was a case of preferential disassembly - that is, cells lacking primary cilia actively promote the disassembly of the structure. In cells that make a primary cilium, perhaps that disassembly process is turned off, so the proteins can build up and form one. But experiments designed to target and block such disassembly had little effect on the presence or absence of primary cilia. That led Dr. Liang to team up with Dr. Joyner, whose lab in the Sloan Kettering Institute has excellent tools for studying how genes regulate developmental processes. If disassembly isn't the key, they thought, then maybe the transcription factors that turn specific genes on or off is what determines whether a cell builds a primary cilium. Liang and Joyner first used a method called single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to identify which of the genes involved in cilia formation and function are turned on in cell types with and without primary cilia. Next, they wondered whether any of those genes were so-called transcription factors - proteins whose main function is turning on other genes. To answer that question, they turned to a technique called Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq), which reveals where the genome is "open" and can be "read" or transcribed. Using that method, the scientists were able to home in on two genes that had telltale signs of being transcription factors. Further analysis revealed that these two genes, Sp5 and Sp8, were very active in cell types with a primary cilium, but inactive in cells lacking one. The most pleasing results came when they either knocked out these genes in cells with cilia or introduced them into cells lacking cilia. Those results showed that Sp5 and Sp8 were required for primary cilium formation in the early mouse embryo. Moreover, simply overexpressing one gene, Sp8, was enough to initiate primary cilium formation in cells without them. Liang and Joyner reasoned that these two proteins, SP5 and SP8, sit at the top of the cell's decision tree for making primary cilia. "We see it as a big breakthrough to find the upstream transcription factors that switch the whole thing on," Dr. Liang adds. Dr. Liang will be leaving MSK shortly to begin her own lab in China, where she hopes to continue working on translating these basic discoveries into clinical breakthroughs for people with ciliopathies. "My long-term goal is to improve our understanding of how cilia are formed and then use that information to benefit the clinical study of ciliopathies," she says. Transcription factors SP5 and SP8 drive primary cilia formation in mammalian embryos.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Using a new chemical labeling strategy, the Dresden team has overcome this limitation, enabling novel insights into where specific lipids are located and how they are transported in cells. Understanding the role of lipids in diseases: Lipid imbalances play a role in several metabolic or neurodegenerative diseases. The identification of the proteins involved in selective lipid transport can accelerate further discoveries of new drug targets for lipid-associated diseases. Lipid molecules, or fats, are crucial to all forms of life. Every cell can create thousands of different lipids, and when they are out of balance, metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases can arise. It is still not well understood how cells sort different types of lipids between cell organelles to maintain the composition of each membrane. A major reason is that lipids are difficult to study, since microscopy techniques to precisely trace their location inside cells have so far been missing. In a long-standing collaboration André Nadler, a chemical biologist at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics (MPI-CBG) in Dresden, Germany teamed up with Alf Honigmann, a bioimaging specialist at Biotechnology Center (BIOTEC) at the TUD Dresden University of Technology, to develop a method that enables visualizing lipids in cells using standard fluorescence microscopy. "We started our project with synthesizing a set of minimally modified lipids that represent the main lipids present in organelle membranes. These modified lipids are essentially the same as their native counterparts, with just a few different atoms that allowed us to track them under the microscope," explains Kristin Böhlig, a PhD student in the Nadler group and chemist who was in charge of creating the modified lipids. The modified lipids mimic natural lipids and are "bifunctional," which means they can be activated by UV light, causing the lipid to bind or crosslink with nearby proteins. The researchers worked with human cells in cell culture, such as bone or intestinal cells, as they are ideal for imaging. After the treatment with UV light, we were able to monitor the lipids with fluorescence microscopy and capture their location over time. This gave us a comprehensive picture of lipid exchange between cell membrane and organelle membranes." "To address our specific needs, I developed an image analysis pipeline with automated image segmentation assisted by artificial intelligence to quantify the lipid flow through the cellular organelle system," says Juan Iglesias-Artola, who did the image analysis. This non-vesicular transport is much more specific with regard to individual lipid species and their sorting to the different organelles in the cell. These results imply that the lipid compositions of organelle membranes are primarily maintained through fast, species-specific, non-vesicular lipid transport. The results suggest that non-vesicular lipid transport has a key role in the maintenance of each organelle membrane composition. Alf Honigmann, research group leader at the BIOTEC says, "Our lipid-imaging technique enables the mechanistic analysis of lipid transport and function directly in cells, which has been impossible before. Imaging of lipids will allow further discoveries and help to reveal the underlying mechanisms in diseases caused by lipid imbalances. The new technique could potentially help to develop new druggable targets and therapeutic approaches for lipid-associated diseases, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. André Nadler, research group leader at MPI-CBG, looks back at the start of the study, "Imaging lipids in cells has always been one of the most challenging aspects of microscopy. Alf Honigmann and I started discussing about solving the lipid imaging problem as soon as we got hired in close succession at MPI-CBG in 2014/15 and we quickly decided to go for it. As a reward, certain well known global events meant we were required to shut down our laboratories a few months later. Before the revolution in the use of artificial intelligence in image segmentation, we would not have been able to properly quantify the imaging data, so our conclusions would have been much more limited." Researchers still need to determine which lipid-transfer proteins drive the selective transport of different lipid species. They also need to identify the energy sources that power lipid transport and ensure that each organelle keeps its own unique membrane composition.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A KAIST research team has succeeded in developing a universal technology that identifies gene control targets in altered cellular gene networks and restores them. This achievement is expected to be widely applied to new anticancer therapies such as cancer reversibility, drug development, precision medicine, and reprogramming for cell therapy. KAIST (President Kwang Hyung Lee) announced on the 28th of August that Professor Kwang-Hyun Cho's research team from the Department of Bio and Brain Engineering has developed a technology to systematically identify gene control targets that can restore the altered stimulus-response patterns of cells to normal by using an algebraic approach. The research team represented the complex interactions among genes within a cell as a "logic circuit diagram" (Boolean network). Based on this, they visualized how a cell responds to external stimuli as a "landscape map" (phenotype landscape). By applying a mathematical method called the "semi-tensor product," they developed a way to quickly and accurately calculate how the overall cellular response would change if a specific gene were controlled. To address this, the research team applied a numerical approximation method (Taylor approximation) to simplify the calculations. Through this, the team was able to calculate which stable state (attractor) a cell would reach and predict how the cell's state would change when a particular gene was controlled. Professor Cho's team applied the developed control technology to various gene networks and verified that it can accurately predict gene control targets that restore altered stimulus-response patterns of cells back to normal. In particular, by applying it to bladder cancer cell networks, they identified gene control targets capable of restoring altered responses to normal. They also discovered gene control targets in large-scale distorted gene networks during immune cell differentiation that are capable of restoring normal stimulus-response patterns. This enabled them to solve problems that previously required only approximate searches through lengthy computer simulations in a fast and systematic way. This study is evaluated as a core original technology for the development of the Digital Cell Twin model, which analyzes and controls the phenotype landscape of gene networks that determine cell fate. In the future, it is expected to be widely applicable across the life sciences and medicine, including new anticancer therapies through cancer reversibility, drug development, precision medicine, and reprogramming for cell therapy." ※ Paper title: "Reverse Control of Biological Networks to Restore Phenotype Landscapes" ※ DOI: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adw3995 The Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) Reverse control of biological networks to restore phenotype landscapes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a rare genetic disorder with symptoms, including facial anomalies (such as fused eyebrows, short nose, upturned nose tip, and downturned mouth corners), growth retardation, small head (microcephaly), developmental delays, cognitive impairments, excess hair growth, and limb anomalies. Currently, mutations in seven genes (NIBPL, SMC1A, SMC3, RAD21, BRD4, HDAC8, and ANKRD11) are known to be associated with CdLS. CdLS is diagnosed based on both genetic testing and clinical examination. The study was published online in Pediatric Investigation on 02 July 2025. Based on a standard scoring system, 12 patients presented with classic CdLS. Global developmental delays were observed in 16 children, while prenatal growth retardation and short stature were observed in 14 children. The most frequent clinical presentations were craniofacial anomalies, especially a short nose and upturned nose tip, and small hands and/or feet. Skin aberrations and hearing loss were less common. Whole-exome sequencing revealed 19 mutations in three genes. Most of these mutations (15 mutations) were detected in the gene NIPBL, which encodes a development-related protein delangin. Two new variants (one missense mutation and one splicing variant) were detected in SMC1A (a chromosome structure-regulating gene). The study also examined whether genetic changes are correlated with clinical presentation. The major correlation was detected with NIPBL null variants, which are a type of mutation that results in the complete loss of gene function. To examine the potential therapeutic strategies for CdLS, the study focused on three patients whose parents requested recombinant human growth hormone (rh-GH) therapy. One female patient diagnosed with CdLS at the age of 3 years underwent rh-GH therapy at the age of 5 years. One male patient diagnosed with CdLS at the age of 10 years continues to undergo rh-GH therapy and has increased his height by 12 cm. Although the patient's height increased by 10 cm within 1 year, the treatment was discontinued owing to hand and foot enlargement. The lead author, Xiaoqiao Li, remarks that "While rh-GH therapy was effective in two cases, it was associated with undesirable outcomes in one patient. Hence, individualized treatment plan and dosage monitoring are critical to enhance treatment effectiveness and minimize adverse effects." By identifying the characteristics of CdLS, this study provided directions for clinicians to diagnose CdLS and develop management strategies specifically for Chinese patients.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But these systems, which use deep learning to predict protein shapes from sequences of amino acid building blocks, require computer science expertise. "Traditional binder discovery methods involve screening tens of thousands of protein candidates, which requires experimental capabilities and computational expertise that not every lab can afford or has," says Lennart Nickel, a PhD student in the Laboratory of Protein Design and Immunoengineering (LPDI), led by Bruno Correia, in EPFL's School of Engineering. Instead of feeding amino acid sequences into a neural network and painstakingly screening the resulting binders for a good fit, the EPFL team, in collaboration with scientists at MIT, used structures fed into Google DeepMind's AlphaFold2 system to generate sequences for new binders based on a set of desired functional properties – like binding to a specific target. By focusing on a small number of binder designs, rather than high-throughput screening of vast libraries of candidates, BindCraft makes protein design more efficient as well as more democratized. For their study, the team validated binders designed to interact with a dozen biotechnological and therapeutic molecules, including AAVs (adeno-associated viruses), which are used to deliver therapeutic genes into target cells; the CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease, which is used in gene editing applications; and certain common allergens. Overall, experiments showed that the team's binders attached to their intended targets with an average success rate of 46%, offering the possibility of greater therapeutic control. "For AAVs, the idea is to use these new binders to enable gene delivery only to specific cells and tissues while minimizing the risk of potential side effects. In the case of CRISPR-Cas9, our binders can stop its gene editing activity and keep it from acting when and where it shouldn't," explains first author and LPDI scientist Martin Pacesa. Since the initial publication of BindCraft as a preprint last fall, the platform has already seen swift and enthusiastic uptake by the biology community, sparking requests from users for modifications and additional functionalities. "We were surprised by how quickly our tool has been adopted – it is even already being used in industry. The requests from users are a great inspiration to continue developing our method. We are already working on adapting BindCraft for smaller therapeutically relevant molecules like peptides," Pacesa says. One-shot design of functional protein binders with BindCraft.
