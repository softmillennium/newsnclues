                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wikipedia is being pressed to release names of specific editors, a tactic seemingly pushed by the Heritage Foundation. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size. A pair of House Republicans is moving forward with an investigation that will seek to reveal the identities of Wikipedia editors who have edited articles to include information that portrays Israel negatively. The representatives asked Wikimedia's CEO, Maryana Iskander, for “assistance in obtaining documents and communications regarding individuals (or specific accounts) serving as Wikipedia volunteer editors who violated Wikipedia platform policies as well as your own efforts to thwart intentional, organized efforts to inject bias into important and sensitive topics.” The letter requested information about “nation state actors” or “academic institutions” that may have been involved in efforts to “edit or influence content identified as possibly violating Wikipedia policies.” The letter sent by Comer and Mace requests that Wikimedia provide Congress with “records showing identifying and unique characteristics of accounts (such as names, IP addresses, registration dates, user activity logs) for editors” who have been “subject to actions” by Wikipedia's Arbitration Committee, which resolves internal disputes between editors. It was, in essence, a request by Congress for Wikipedia to “dox” many of its editors. “In the culture of Wikipedia editing, it is common for individuals to use pseudonyms to protect their privacy and avoid personal threats,” wrote tech writer and Wikipedia expert Stephen Harrison for Slate in February. That report, however, has been heavily criticized, including by some of the academics it cited. Klein described the study's interpretation of the facts as “very skewed” and said it was reliant “on a faulty premise: that criticism of Israel or Zionism is inherently antisemitic.” “To establish foul play, the ADL would need to demonstrate that Wikipedia content about Israel and Zionism regularly expresses as fact ideas that diverge from broadly held scholarly opinions on the matters in question,” Klein said. “But where is the evidence of editors repeatedly misrepresenting or contradicting peer-reviewed literature? However, right-wing efforts to undermine Wikipedia's independence and attack the privacy of its editors go back much further. Among the methodologies it directed Heritage employees to use include “analyzing text patterns, usernames, and technical data through data breach analysis, fingerprinting, [human intelligence], and technical targeting.” The targeting methods also included “creating fake Wikipedia user accounts to try to trick editors into identifying themselves by sharing personal information or clicking on malicious tracking links that can identify people who click on them.” Jewish Voice for Peace has described Project Esther as Heritage's “blueprint for using the federal government and private institutions to dismantle then Palestine solidarity movement and broader US civil society, under the guise of ‘fighting antisemitism. “Targeting Wikipedia editors personally, instead of debating their edits on the platform, marks a dangerous escalation.” Johnson noted that this push was coming as the clear majority of Americans, including an overwhelming number of Democrats, now oppose US support for Israel, with many now believing the country is committing a genocide.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>College quotas haven't existed since 1978, but the right keeps people misinformed. Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! Like other elite higher education institutions such as Harvard, Columbia, the University of Pennsylvania, and many others targeted by the Trump administration, UVA capitulated to the coercive authority and dictatorial weaponization of civil rights law. UVA buckled under the pressure of a series of anti-DEI and anti-higher education executive orders issued by Donald Trump during his second term as president, targeting colleges and universities that resisted his racist, sexist, and transphobic agenda. The Trump administration has also targeted the college accreditation system in order to, among other goals, maintain ideological control over what is taught in university classrooms. My goal as an educator is to challenge these and other inaccurate beliefs in the classroom. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. I've been teaching university students in Virginia since 2009, and during the past 16 years at least one of my students every year has expressed the belief that colleges routinely use “quotas” as part of their admissions process, and that Black students benefit unfairly from this practice. I typically ask my students: How is it possible that such a blatantly inaccurate idea could persist for almost half a century? And what purpose do these false narratives serve within American society? First, systematic disinformation about affirmative action is rooted in anti-Blackness, a racist ideology that specifically and uniquely targets people who are racially identified as Black. As sociologist Vilna Bashi Treitler wrote in her book The Ethnic Project, in order to gain favor from white people, nonwhite groups have historically distanced themselves from Black people or denigrated Black people in order to gain white acceptance, or to simply avoid being treated as badly as a Black person. Anti-Blackness is at the heart of anti-affirmative action rhetoric by suggesting that “unqualified” Black students have stolen spots from “qualified” white students. And what purpose do these false narratives serve within American society? In his book Black Marxism, late political scientist Cedric Robinson used the term “racial capitalism” to highlight the interconnected and interdependent relationship between racism and modern capitalism. Racial capitalism as a concept posits that modern capitalism was always rooted in the exploitation of racialized “others”; it was not just an economic system rooted in class exploitation as some Marxists believe. European colonizers used the ideology of white supremacy as a form of propaganda to dehumanize the personhood of Africans and their descendants in order to justify the inhumane methods used to extract free labor from which white settlers profited financially. “Meritocracy” is an ideological weapon that the descendants of European colonizers currently use to justify a system built on the exploitation and dehumanization of Black bodies. The idea of meritocracy is used to justify a society where executive orders are created to legislate a white-centered and flawed teaching of history intended to keep the masses ignorant of how deeply inequitable this country is and has always been. Meritocracy also functions as a psychological prop for white folks who need to believe that they deserve to have more than other groups — that whiteness is in fact better, smarter, and more competent. Meritocracy cannot exist in a system rooted in racial capitalism, where racialized groups are exploited for the benefit of a more powerful majority group, and racial capitalism is as foundational to the U.S. economy, its financial, and its educational institutions as apple pie. Reminiscent of Lee Atwater's “Southern Strategy,” white supremacy now draws on race-neutral language and dog whistles to make racist claims while maintaining plausible deniability. White public figures like President Donald Trump have reframed affirmative action policies designed initially to address centuries of systemic racism against Black people as “discriminatory” and “unmeritocratic” (“reverse racism”), despite the lack of empirical evidence to support this belief. Racial capitalism is about crafting an ideology that rationalizes the exploitation of racialized groups such that their exploitation is viewed as normal. The widespread misrepresentation of affirmative action policies as “unmeritocratic” fulfills this purpose by normalizing racial gaps in educational attainment and economic outcomes. Additionally, the use of inequitable gate-keeping tools such as Scholastic Assessment Tests (SATs) and legacy policies that advantage the children of white elites and students belonging to an upper socioeconomic status in college admissions are tools of white supremacy (anti-Blackness in particular) that provide metaphorical fuel for the engine of racial capitalism. For example, sociologist Joseph Soares points to the biased practice of excluding experimental SAT questions from the exam when Black students perform better on them than white students. Soares also notes that Black students perform better than white students on tests that are based on the delivery of a curriculum actually taught in high school. However, the SATs were developed to assess “aptitude” for learning, not competence in a particular subject matter. It is no surprise, then, that Black students do not perform as well on the SATs as their white (and Asian) peers. Yet, SATs have become a staple requirement for admission to most colleges and universities, following Harvard, which started to require them in 1935. During the 2020 pandemic, over 90 percent of colleges and universities decided to make SATs optional or did not consider them at all. However, as of April 2025, a growing list of public, private, and Ivy League schools have decided to reinstate the SATs as a requirement for college admissions, despite evidence of the SATs' racial and class-based bias. When there are mechanisms in place that systematically limit the ability for Black students to attend and graduate from college, these barriers play a de facto role in perpetuating racial capitalism. Selective private institutions are more likely to consider legacy status than public institutions, so this policy disproportionately benefits students from economically privileged backgrounds. Unsurprisingly, none of the arguments put forth for why colleges and universities continue to use legacy admissions relate to “merit.” In fact, non-legacies at Harvard, for example, outperform legacies in every category except athletics. And, despite a general consensus among 75 percent of Americans that the utilization of legacy admissions policies is an inequitable practice, there has not been the same intense public uproar or targeted legal battle to undermine it as there has been against the use of affirmative action in college admissions. And, because college-educated individuals make, on average, higher salaries than those who do not attend college, a college degree is a gateway for economic success and upward mobility. Clearly, the SATs and legacy admissions practices are functioning exactly as intended — to keep “racial undesirables” from accessing higher education or relegating them to less prestigious and less resourced schools. A 2022 report published by the Presidential Committee on Harvard & the Legacy of Slavery acknowledges that Harvard University presidents, faculty, staff, and students benefited from the labor of enslaved Black people from its founding in 1636 until it became illegal in Massachusetts in 1783. Harvard is not unique, as is evidenced in the 2013 book Ebony & Ivy written by Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor and historian Craig Wilder. This means that anti-affirmative action rhetoric is blatantly and intentionally ahistorical, and survives due in large part to an active investment in maintaining white ignorance. In June 2023, these were the ideological and rhetorical tools that the predominantly white and conservative Supreme Court used to dismantle affirmative action in college admissions. In higher education institutions, the reframing of affirmative action as a program that makes it possible for unqualified Black students to take the place of qualified white ones is a convenient narrative that legitimizes gate-keeping systems designed to exclude Black students and other students of color from earning credentials that could lead to upward mobility. In the meantime, the children of white elite families continue to benefit from legacy admissions policies that give them an unfair advantage in college admissions. Unsurprisingly, despite evidence that both SATs and legacy admissions have racist roots and are biased against low-income students and students with minoritized racial identities, the Trump administration has yet to prioritize this as an inequitable practice that the administration should address to be consistent with their avowed commitment to a meritocratic society.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Seven Israeli soldiers were wounded in an explosion targeting an armoured vehicle in Gaza City on Friday night, the Israel Defense Forces have said. Israel declared Gaza City a “dangerous combat zone” on Friday, ending the daily humanitarian pauses that were meant to alleviate hunger there. Gaza City is in the throes of famine, a result of an Israeli blockade that despite the pauses has choked off food and medical supplies into the territory. Israel's war in Gaza has killed more than 63,000 people over the last 23 months. Israel launched the war after Hamas-led militants carried out an attack in southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. On Thursday, Abu Obeida, a spokesperson for Hamas's military wing, warned that Israel's plans to occupy Gaza City would increase the chances of the group capturing Israeli soldiers and that any Israeli military operation would put the lives of remaining hostages at risk. Before its offensive, the Israeli military is seeking to forcibly displace the residents of Gaza City to southern Gaza. Israeli bombardments of the area have intensified in recent days, with the Israeli air force carrying out strikes on tent encampments in Zeitoun and the al-Nasr neighbourhood of Gaza City on Saturday morning, according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa. The renewed bombardment has already caused more than 23,000 residents of Gaza City to leave, the UN said on Thursday. “It is impossible that a mass evacuation of Gaza City could ever be done in a way that is safe and dignified under the current conditions,” said Mirjana Spoljaric in a statement on Saturday. Gaza's health ministry reported on Saturday that 10 people had died as a result of starvation or malnutrition in the past 24 hours, including three children. Since the war beganin October 2023, 332 people have starved to death in Gaza – the majority of whom have died since July. Despite the worsening humanitarian crisis, Israel will soon slow or halt aid into parts of northern Gaza as it begins its Gaza City offensive, an Israeli official told the Associated Press on Saturday. The continued Israeli-aid blockade and planned Gaza City operation has drawn a global outcry, including condemnation by six European foreign ministers on Friday. Many EU member states, such as Ireland and Spain, have called for a suspension of the bloc's free trade pact with Israel, but countries including Germany and Hungary are against this measure. “I'm not very optimistic, and today we are definitely not going to adopt decisions … We are divided about this issue,” Kallas told journalists at a meeting in Denmark for foreign ministers to discuss suspending EU funding to Israeli startups. The Irish foreign minister, Simon Harris, said: “If the EU does not act as a collective now and take sanctions against Israel, whenever will it. It also denied and revoked the visas of about 80 Palestinian officials. Abbas was due to attend a conference where Britain, France, Canada and Australia are expected to recognise a Palestinian state – a step opposed by the US and Israel. EU foreign ministers urged the US to reconsider its decision to bar Palestinian officials from attending the UN general assembly, Kallas said on Saturday. The Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, called the decision “unjust” and expressed support in a phone call to Abbas. Palestine is a member of the UN and is a permanent observer state, allowing it to participate in the organisation's proceedings.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The impending execution of a man by firing squad in Utah was blocked by the state's supreme court on Friday after his attorneys argued he should be spared because he has dementia. Ralph Leroy Menzies, 67, was set to be executed on 5 September for abducting and killing Utah mother of three Maurine Hunsaker in 1986. He would have become only the sixth US prisoner executed by firing squad since 1977. Lawyers for Menzies had launched a new push beginning in early 2024 to free him of his death sentence, arguing that the dementia their client had developed during his 37 years on death row is so severe that he uses a wheelchair, is dependent on oxygen and can't understand why he is facing execution. The Utah supreme court said Menzies adequately alleged a substantial change of circumstances and raised a significant question on his fitness to be executed, concluding a lower court must re-evaluate his competency. “We acknowledge that this uncertainty has caused the family of Maurine Hunsaker immense suffering, and it is not our desire to prolong that suffering. “We look forward to presenting our case in the trial court,” attorney Lindsey Layer said. In a statement to media outlets, Hunsaker's family members said they “are obviously very distraught and disappointed at the supreme court's decision” and asked for privacy. Menzies is not the first person to receive a dementia diagnosis while awaiting execution. The US supreme court in 2019 blocked the execution of a man with dementia in Alabama, ruling that Vernon Madison was protected against execution under a constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. That case followed earlier supreme court rulings barring executions of people with severe mental illness. If a defendant cannot understand why they are dying, the supreme court said, then an execution is not carrying out the retribution that society is seeking. Medical experts brought in by prosecutors during hearings into Menzies's competency said he still has the mental capacity to understand his situation. Experts brought in by the defense said he does not. Utah's last execution played out by lethal injection a year ago. Earlier this year, South Carolina executed two prisoners by firing squad.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Lithuanian military has installed obstacles to strengthen security at unused roads at border checkpoints with Russia and Belarus, LRT broadcaster reported on Aug. 30. Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, three NATO members sharing borders with Russia and its ally Belarus, have increasingly raised alarm over the Russian threat since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. "The installed barriers are only part of a large, integrated picture," Lithuanian military chief Raimundas Vaiksnoras said. New obstacles have already been installed at the unused Sumskas, Lavoriskes, Raigardas, and Latezeris border crossings with Belarus, as well as at the Romaniskes border checkpoint with Russia's heavily fortified Kaliningrad exclave and other areas. Past years saw Lithuania ramp up security measures amid fears of a possible conflict between NATO and Russia. Vilnius also recently held the Fierce Wolf 2025 military drills in response to the upcoming Zapad 2025 exercises in Belarus, expected to involve 30,000 Russian and Belarusian military personnel. Martin Fornusek is a news editor at the Kyiv Independent. He was also volunteering as an editor and translator at the Czech-language version of Ukraïner. U.S. officials have grown increasingly impatient with European leaders, whom they allege are pushing Ukraine to hold out for a "better deal," Axios reported in an exclusive scoop on Aug. 30. Andrii Parubii, a Ukrainian politician who previously served as the parliament speaker and played a prominent role in the EuroMaidan Revolution, was shot dead in Lviv on Aug. 30. The focus for such U.S. contractors appears to be on helping to build new defenses and securing U.S. business interests in Ukraine, the Telegraph reported. Polish authorities have expelled 15 Ukrainian citizens after they were detained for offenses like drug possession, drunk driving, theft, and illegal border crossings, RMF24 reported on Aug. 30. Russia launched a missile and drone attack targeting various Ukrainian regions overnight on Aug. 30, killing at least one person and injuring 30 others, officials reported. The facility was used to store pyroxylin gunpowder, a smokeless powder used in the production of small arms, artillery, and rocket systems, a military intelligence source claimed. What's it really like to live in a Ukrainian village during wartime? "(Russian President Vladimir) Putin is destabilizing a big part of our country," German Chancellor Friedrich Merz told French outlet La Chaine Info. Military spokesperson Andrii Kovalov acknowledged that reassignments take place, but said this does not concern air defense specialists protecting Ukrainian skies. U.S. President Donald Trump suggested that Chinese peacekeepers could monitor a neutral zone along the front line in Ukraine as part of a potential peace settlement, the Financial Times reported on Aug. 29, citing four undisclosed sources.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israel is set to halt airdrops over Gaza City and reduce the entry of relief trucks ahead of a major offensive, a source told CNN, as the Red Cross warned that Israeli plans for mass evacuation were “impossible.” Israel is preparing to fully capture Gaza's biggest city after nearly two years of war, despite warnings the campaign will have disastrous and unbearable consequences for Palestinians in the besieged region. The Israeli military has carried out heavy bombing and ground attacks on Gaza City in recent days, eyewitnesses and Palestinian authorities say, choking vital services and leaving hundreds of thousands of people crammed into an ever-shrinking area. On Saturday an Israeli strike on Al-Nasr Street, western Gaza City, killed at least 11 Palestinians including six children, local health officials said. CNN footage from the courtyard of the hospital showed a row of dead children shrouded in floral blankets. “I don't know what happened,” one man told CNN. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment. On Friday, the military declared Gaza City a “dangerous combat zone” ahead of the planned assault, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says will target what he calls one of Hamas' “remaining strongholds.” “It is impossible that a mass evacuation of Gaza City could ever be done in a way that is safe and dignified under the current conditions,” ICRC President Mirjana Spoljaric said in a statement, warning that starving, disabled and injured Palestinians were incapable of moving. “Such an evacuation would trigger a massive population movement that no area in the Gaza Strip can absorb, given the widespread destruction of civilian infrastructure and the extreme shortages of food, water, shelter and medical care,” added Spoljaric. More than one million people are displaced in the central and western parts of Gaza City alone, a municipality spokesperson said on Saturday, warning that conditions are already “dire.” “We expect a sharp increase in the number of casualties if the occupation expands its military operation,” said Asem Alnabih. A senior UN official warned this week that residents inside Gaza City – who face physical exhaustion, hunger, malnourishment and fatigue – are also under the constant shadow of bombing, weakening their ability to make life or death decisions. The Israeli military has announced plans to stop 10-hour “tactical pauses” in hostilities, which began a month ago after severe aid restrictions, siege and bombing wrought deadly starvation in the enclave. Further aid restrictions will likely only worsen Palestinians' plight. Nearly 700 days of war have brought “man-made” famine to parts of Gaza, the Integrated Food Security and Nutrition Phase Classification reported last week. New video reveals third strike in deadly ‘double-tap' attack on Gaza hospital One young woman displaced with her family in Tal al-Hawa, western Gaza City – including six siblings aged three to 18 – told CNN she has lost 16 kilograms (35 pounds) since the hostilities began. Of those who died, 124 were children, the ministry added. CNN's Abeer Salman, Eyad Kourdi, Nadeen Ebrahim, Oren Liebermann and Kareem Khadder contributed reporting.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic became the oldest man in 34 years to reach the fourth round of the US Open on Friday night, overcoming lower back issues to defeat Cameron Norrie 6-4, 6-7 (4), 6-2, 6-3. Not since Jimmy Connors' straight-sets victory over Karel Nováček in 1991 has a man older than 38 years and 99 days claimed a third round win at Flushing Meadows. Djokovic's win also means that he has now overtaken Roger Federer for the most career wins at hard-court grand slams in history, with 192, while the pair are also now tied on 69 for the most grand slam fourth round appearances in the Open Era. In truth, Friday's victory was not that simple. Adrian Mannarino wins a match ‘from the toilet' after Ben Shelton retires from US Open with injury “In terms of how I'm feeling, it really goes up and down, to be honest. Yeah, it's frustrating for me, honestly, that I'm not able to feel 100% always like I have for 20-plus years,” the world No. If the body doesn't listen to me when I go deep in the grand slam tournaments, as it was kind of the case last few slams, then that's a hard one to swallow for me, because I know the amount of hours I'm putting in daily to care for my body.” “Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised with Norrie's level,” remarked Djokovic. “I think he was playing really aggressive. You know, credit to him for fighting and playing some really good level.” But the Serbian, after being broken early in the third, retook control, breaking back instantly and winning five consecutive games, to establish a lead from which Norrie would never recover. In particular, Djokovic's serve proved too much for the British player. Djokovic will face off against Jan-Lennard Struff in the fourth round on Sunday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"(Russian President Vladimir) Putin is destabilizing a big part of our country," Merz told French outlet La Chaine Info. Western leaders have repeatedly accused Moscow of hybrid operations and sabotage attacks across the European continent, targeting countries supporting Ukraine. But today, unfortunately, we are very, very far from that," the German leader continued, adding that Putin wants to "restore the Soviet Union." Since taking office in May, Merz has ramped up German military support for Ukraine and taken a tougher line towards the Russian leader. Despite his earlier promises, the chancellor has held off on sending some key military equipment, most famously Taurus missiles. Earlier this week, the New York Times and the German outlet WirtschaftsWoche reported growing concerns over suspected Russian drone flights over U.S. arms routes in Germany. Officials quoted by the outlets presented the flights as espionage of Western arms heading to Ukraine and possible preparations for further sabotage operations in Europe. Based in Kyiv, he covers weapons production and defense tech. His work has appeared in Radio Free Europe, Fortune, Breaking Defense, the Cipher Brief, the Foreign Policy Research Institute, FT's Sifted, and Science Magazine. Andrii Parubii, a Ukrainian politician who previously served as the parliament speaker and played a prominent role in the EuroMaidan Revolution, was shot dead in Lviv on Aug. 30. Russia launched a missile and drone attack targeting various Ukrainian regions overnight on Aug. 30, killing at least one person and injuring 34 others, officials reported. U.S. officials have grown increasingly impatient with European leaders, whom they allege are pushing Ukraine to hold out for a "better deal," Axios reported in an exclusive scoop on Aug. 30. The focus for such U.S. contractors appears to be on helping to build new defenses and securing U.S. business interests in Ukraine, the Telegraph reported. Polish authorities have expelled 15 Ukrainian citizens after they were detained for offenses like drug possession, drunk driving, theft, and illegal border crossings, RMF24 reported on Aug. 30. The facility was used to store pyroxylin gunpowder, a smokeless powder used in the production of small arms, artillery, and rocket systems, a military intelligence source claimed. What's it really like to live in a Ukrainian village during wartime? "(Russian President Vladimir) Putin is destabilizing a big part of our country," German Chancellor Friedrich Merz told French outlet La Chaine Info. Military spokesperson Andrii Kovalov acknowledged that reassignments take place, but said this does not concern air defense specialists protecting Ukrainian skies. U.S. President Donald Trump suggested that Chinese peacekeepers could monitor a neutral zone along the front line in Ukraine as part of a potential peace settlement, the Financial Times reported on Aug. 29, citing four undisclosed sources.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Within a 200-metre radius of transit stations, 30-storey towers are now permitted under certain circumstances.Cole Burston/The Globe and Mail The Ontario government, alongside Toronto City Hall, recently announced planning reforms in Canada's largest city that would legalize larger apartment buildings around most transit stations. Ontario Housing Minister Rob Flack and Toronto Mayor Olivia Chow jointly announced the changes on Aug. 15. Within approximately 800 metres of a station, four-storey apartments are now permitted. The announcement “definitely indicates a change of direction in Toronto,” said planning consultant Blair Scorgie. But there is uncertainty about how the city will actually implement this.” Experts also say other tax and policy shifts are required to revive the city's stalled housing sector. Last week, federal Housing and Infrastructure Minister Gregor Robertson met with Ms. Chow; the two declined to comment on that dispute. Earlier: Toronto Mayor confident city's compromise on sixplexes won't risk federal housing funding In 2019, the Ford government defined 180 mass transit station areas in Toronto, requiring the city to set certain density targets to take advantage of that transit infrastructure. Toronto then created new zoning for those areas, but the city's response was widely criticized as inadequate. Jason Thorne, Toronto's chief planner, said the new density reforms were negotiated by city and provincial staff. Queen's Park was “looking for a more ambitious approach to planning around the station areas,” he said. “We are working very quickly to address that,” Mr. Thorne said. “Normally this would take a year or more for each area, so we are very conscious of the timeline.” Mr. Thorne's department aims to complete the zoning work by next spring. “Chow will need to shepherd this through city council, and she doesn't have a great record of that.” Mr. Beheshti referred to a June vote where city council compromised by allowing sixplex apartments in some wards, but not the whole city, and Ms. Chow didn't speak during the debate. Under this policy, which has been championed by left-leaning councillors and Ms. Chow, condo buildings of 100 or more units will need to ensure five per cent of them are affordable rentals. However, for private development projects already in the works, this presents a new, potentially prohibitive cost. “While enabling the city's use of inclusionary zoning is overdue as a tool to deliver meaningful affordable housing, the timing of the Minister's decision will delay and potentially negatively impact certain projects,” said lawyer David Bronskill, a partner at Goodmans LLP who often represents private developers in negotiations with the city. “Unfortunately, inclusionary zoning only works if development projects actually proceed to construction.” Marsha Lederman: Toronto the Grind: Making your way around has never been such a slog Since 2005, the province has focused on new growth as “intensification” within cities. Instead, developers and builders typically negotiate site-by-site to amend city regulations. This often involves an appeal to the Ontario Land Tribunal. These new reforms could make for a more straightforward process in some cases, Mr. Beheshti said. For builders, “there was a yes at the end of the tunnel, but you had to run a gauntlet of ‘no' to get there.” For some properties, Mr. Beheshti said that will now become less arduous. How things shake down at city council could be very different.” Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>France is set to table new proposals for sanctions against Russia during an informal gathering of EU foreign ministers in Copenhagen, Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told reporters ahead of the meeting. "I will present proposals developed by France so that we can deplete the resources that [Russia] is investing in this war and stop the Russian war machine by targeting the energy sector, the financial sector, and perhaps also certain civilian segments that continue to indirectly support Russia's military efforts," Barrot said. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas confirmed that sanctions expansion would be on the agenda, though she emphasized that no binding decisions can be made at this stage. The 19th sanctions package The European Commission is preparing its 19th package of measures, which Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has promised to adopt in September. According to Politico, the bloc has largely exhausted its most effective levers of economic pressure on Moscow, meaning few surprises are expected. The new package will reportedly include tighter restrictions on Russia's energy and banking sectors, along with the blacklisting of additional individuals and entities. Von der Leyen also pledged "new steps" on the handling of frozen Russian assets. The Commission later clarified that this would not involve outright expropriation, but rather the further confiscation of income generated by reinvestment of the €210 billion in Russian sovereign assets blocked within the EU. Brussels is also weighing the use of secondary sanctions - penalties aimed at countries and companies outside the EU that continue trading with Russia and helping it circumvent restrictions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian President Vladimir Putin highly praised the level of Russian-Chinese relations across various spheres, from international politics to cinema and sports. "I greatly look forward to visiting the city of Tianjin, which will host the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit under China's presidency. We expect that the summit will give the Organisation powerful new momentum, strengthen its capacity to respond to contemporary challenges and threats, and enhance solidarity across our shared Eurasian space. All this will help shape a fairer multipolar world order," Putin stated. "As for the Russian-Chinese talks, these will take place in Beijing <...> on all aspects of our bilateral agenda, <...> on pressing regional and international issues," Putin added, noting that "the Russia-China strategic partnership acts as a stabilizing force." It is of exceptional importance for China that such a person stands at the helm at this challenging, pivotal moment in international affairs," Putin stressed. This enabled the Red Army to concentrate its efforts on crushing Nazism and liberating Europe," Putin stated. "We are grateful to China for its careful preservation of memorials to Red Army soldiers who gave their lives in battles for the liberation of China," Putin said. "Such a sincere and responsible attitude towards the past stands in stark contrast to the situation in some European countries, where monuments and graves of Soviet liberators are desecrated in a barbaric manner or destroyed, and inconvenient historical facts are erased. "Japanese militarism is being revived under the pretext of imaginary Russian or Chinese threats, while in Europe, including Germany, steps are being taken towards the re-militarisation of the continent, with little regard for historical parallels," he added. "In terms of trade volume, <> transactions between Russia and China are carried out in rubles and yuan, with the dollar or euro share reduced to a statistical discrepancy," Putin emphasized. "Russia firmly retains its position as a leading exporter of oil and gas to China. Since the Power of Siberia pipeline began its operation in 2019, cumulative deliveries of natural gas have already exceeded 100 billion cubic metres. "We continue our joint efforts to reduce bilateral trade barriers. In recent years, the export of pork and beef to China has been launched," Putin noted, adding that "Russia is one of the world's principal markets for Chinese car exports." "At the same time, production is being localised in Russia not only for Chinese cars but also for household appliances. <...> We also have large-scale plans in the construction materials industry," he said. <...> President Xi and I agreed that 2026-2027 will be designated as the Russia-China Years of Education," Putin noted. "The Russian side initiated the Intervision International Song Contest, scheduled for September 20 this year, and we are pleased that our Chinese partners have shown keen interest in this project," he added. "We are grateful to our Chinese partners for their active participation in international sporting events hosted by Russia. <...> We firmly believe that sport should remain free from any politicisation," Putin affirmed. "We anticipate the release of many new Russian-Chinese films in the near future: films that will promote sound moral principles and traditional spiritual and ethical values, while presenting truthful accounts of important historical events. To this end, we have also launched a new initiative, the Open Eurasian Film Award, a unique platform for cinema, free from bias or political intrigue," Putin noted. "Tourism is another important sphere I would like to note. The figures here are encouraging: by the end of 2024, mutual tourist flows had increased 2.5 times, reaching 2.8 million people," he added. In particular, we advocate for making the Security Council more democratic by including states from Asia, Africa, and Latin America," Putin emphasized.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vance has accused Politico of running a “foreign influence operation” against special envoy Steve Witkoff, blasting the outlet's reporting as “journalistic malpractice” for relying on anonymous officials while excluding on-the-record statements from senior figures who defended him. The article, published on Friday by Politico correspondent Felicia Schwartz with the headline “‘His inexperience shines through': Steve Witkoff struggles to manage Russia as Trump peace envoy,” cited 13 anonymous American and foreign officials who claimed that Witkoff lacks diplomatic skills and has caused confusion in ongoing negotiations with Moscow. But it's more than that: it's a foreign influence operation meant to hurt the administration and one of our most effective members,” Vance wrote on X. The only people Politico mentioned by name were those actually defending Witkoff. Vance said Schwartz omitted his own full statement as well as quotes from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, former White House adviser Jared Kushner, and British diplomat Jonathan Powell. Powell, the UK's former chief negotiator in Northern Ireland, was quoted briefly as saying Witkoff “opened doors no one else could.” However, in his full remarks, he dismissed the “snobbery in diplomacy” and explained at length why Witkoff is “exactly the kind” of independent negotiator who succeeds where others fail. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also accused Politico of deliberately cherry-picking quotes to fit a narrative. Witkoff has led the Trump administration's back-channel talks with Russia and held multiple meetings with President Vladimir Putin and other top officials as part of Washington's efforts to negotiate an end to the Ukraine conflict. Politico also claimed, citing another anonymous “person familiar,” that the Russians in touch with Witkoff are “frustrated” by his supposed “inability to properly convey Putin's messages and red lines to Trump.” Russian officials, however, have spoken warmly of him, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov previously saying “we are always glad to see Mr. Witkoff in Moscow,” and calling the meetings “important, meaningful, and very useful.”</p>
