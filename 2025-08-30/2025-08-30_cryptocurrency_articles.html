                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>- Tether halts USDT freezes on legacy blockchains (Omni, BCH SLP, etc.) - Tron dominates 51% of USDT liquidity ($73B) with low-cost transactions, while Ethereum leverages upgrades to strengthen DeFi infrastructure. - Bitcoin's RGB-enabled USDT integration ($167B liquidity) repositions it as a scalable payments layer, challenging its store-of-value narrative. - Regulatory risks (GENIUS Act, MiCAR) and network upgrades (Tron's Kant, Ethereum staking yields) will shape capital allocation in the evolving stablecoin ecosystem. Tether's 2025 decision to abandon USDT freezes on legacy blockchains—Omni Layer, Bitcoin Cash SLP, Kusama, EOS, and Algorand—reflects a broader recalibration of capital allocation and operational efficiency in the stablecoin market. By maintaining transferability of existing tokens while ceasing new issuance and redemption, Tether has prioritized user retention and reputational stability over abrupt disruptions [1]. This strategic pivot underscores a market-wide shift toward blockchain networks with robust developer activity, scalability, and high user demand, such as Ethereum and Tron [2]. Meanwhile, Ethereum's recent $1 billion USDT mint underscores its role as a foundational layer for DeFi, leveraging upgrades like Pectra and Dencun to enhance scalability [4]. These developments signal a structural realignment: investors must now weigh the trade-offs between Tron's low-cost, high-volume model and Ethereum's deflationary supply dynamics and institutional adoption. By enabling fast, private, and scalable transactions on Bitcoin's infrastructure, Tether has positioned the network as a global payments layer, with $167 billion in liquidity potentially boosting cross-border remittances and DeFi applications [5]. This innovation challenges Bitcoin's traditional store-of-value narrative, aligning it with capital-efficient use cases that could attract institutional participation [6]. For investors, the long-term value shift toward supported, scalable chains is clear. Investors should also monitor Tron's Kant mainnet upgrade and Ethereum's staking yields (3.8%) as indicators of sustained capital allocation [9]. In conclusion, Tether's strategic shift reflects a market prioritizing operational efficiency and scalability. Investors must remain agile, balancing short-term gains with long-term risks in a rapidly evolving landscape. By continuing, I agree to the Market Data Terms of Service and Privacy Statement</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>River says companies are taking in far more bitcoin each day than miners create. The U.S.-based bitcoin financial services firm, which runs brokerage and mining operations and publishes research, released a Sankey-style flow infographic dated Aug. 25 in a post on X. The category combines bitcoin treasury companies — firms such as Strategy that publicly hold BTC — with conventional companies that keep bitcoin on their balance sheets. Based on public filings, custodial address tagging and its own heuristics, River estimates that about 1,755 BTC per day flow into business-controlled wallets. By comparison, River calculates new miner supply at about 450 BTC per day in 2025. With bitcoin blocks averaging one every 10 minutes — about 144 per day — the result is roughly 450 BTC in new issuance daily, though the exact number fluctuates slightly as block times vary. That math is the basis for River's claim that companies are absorbing bitcoin at nearly four times the rate it is mined. Funds and ETFs account for about 1,430 BTC/day in net inflows, which further boosts total absorption compared with new issuance. River also records a small but steady flow into “lost bitcoin” (about 14 BTC/day), representing coins that the firm judges to be permanently inaccessible, such as through key loss. River stresses that this does not necessarily mean retail investors are dumping coins. River says the takeaway is simple: when inflows to businesses and funds exceed new issuance from miners, available supply tightens. River relies on a mix of wallet tagging, public disclosures and external databases, which may miss some holdings or misclassify certain addresses. Second, net inflows do not always equal direct spot buying. A business wallet showing +1,755 BTC per day could reflect OTC transactions, custodial transfers or treasury reshuffling, not just exchange purchases. If more coins consistently end up in business, fund and government wallets than miners are producing, River argues that institutions are tightening supply at the margin. River's snapshot is not a price forecast, but it illustrates how ownership patterns may be shifting. If businesses and funds continue to absorb more than miners produce, the firm argues, institutions could play a larger role in shaping bitcoin's supply dynamics.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For years, Ripple has positioned its product suite as uniquely optimized to power mainstream global payments, differentiating it from the abstract, token-driven systems envisaged by Bitcoin and other blockchains. But with Circle, Stripe, and Google all planning to launch their own payment-focused Layer 1 chains, Ripple's offering faces new competition. However, several designs for tokenized deposits and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) also leverage blockchain technology. Nor does the infrastructure for stablecoin payment acceptance come close to global card networks. Against this backdrop, Circle, Stripe, and Google are seeking to reimagine blockchain payments by building new, custom blockchains from the ground up. High throughput chains like Solana and Polygon have brought USDC fees down to less than $0.01 per transaction. But fees need to be paid in each network's native token, introducing an extra layer of complexity for users. Because it utilizes USDC as its gas currency, Circle's Arc seeks to overcome this problem, lowering fees and simplifying both the developer and user experience of stablecoins. In a similar vein, Stripe's proposed blockchain, codenamed Tempo, is reportedly designed to speed up stablecoin transactions, lower costs, and attract enterprise customers, especially large-scale businesses. Rather than simply building a new stablecoin chain like Circle and Stripe, Google Cloud Universal Ledger (GCUL) is envisaged as a much more open-ended blockchain payments solution. Both the rise of stablecoins and Google's under-development blockchain platform pose a threat to Ripple, which provides cross-border payment solutions that bypass the correspondent banking system. These days, however, stablecoins offer many of the same advantages for international transfers, and there are a growing number of payment solutions that leverage stablecoins as a cross-border settlement layer. Facing intense competition, Ripple launched RLUSD in 2024, positioning it as a more institution-friendly alternative to USDT and USDC. But with Circle and Tether increasingly vying for the institutional stablecoin market with custom products and services, it may be too late for Ripple to catch up. Meanwhile, Google is focusing on the high-value backbone of capital markets, building a product that could have broad appeal across banking and finance. If the platform functions as an orchestration solution for different forms of digital money, including stablecoins, tokenized deposits and potentially even CBDCs, banks could extend it to cross-border treasury, trade finance, and payment service provider settlements—areas Ripple courts today.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But Ethereum isn't the only asset getting attention. Traders are also watching ecosystem plays like Uniswap—and newer projects like Layer Brett—for the kind of upside ETH can't offer anymore. The Ethereum price prediction conversation is heating up—again. The reasons are clear: Ethereum still leads in smart contracts, NFTs, and DeFi—and staking is giving holders even more reason to stick around. But that same dominance can also be a drag. With such a massive market cap, Ethereum just doesn't have the room to explode like it used to. The Ethereum price prediction remains strong, but for traders chasing life-changing gains, ETH isn't the only bet. Whales are diversifying—and ecosystem tokens like Uniswap and Layer Brett are catching serious attention as the next wave of high-growth opportunities within the Ethereum universe. Uniswap is back on whale radar—and not just as a tag-along to Ethereum's rally. Whale wallets have been steadily accumulating, with large withdrawals from centralised exchanges suggesting big players are positioning early. Uniswap also scored regulatory credibility through its Wyoming DAO structure, a legal step forward that's giving some investors more confidence in the long-term viability of the protocol. If Ethereum breaks out, on-chain activity follows—and Uniswap benefits directly. That's why traders watching the Ethereum price prediction aren't just holding ETH. They're doubling down on ecosystem tokens with utility, traction, and upside. While Ethereum leads the market and Uniswap captures DeFi flows, Layer Brett is carving out its own lane—by combining meme energy with real Ethereum Layer 2 infrastructure. Layer Brett's fast, cheap, and live, with a staking dApp already paying out APYs north of 2,000%. For traders watching Ethereum's climb but still hunting high-multiple plays, Layer Brett is hard to ignore. The Layer Brett presale has cleared $1.5 million, the token supply is capped at 10 billion, and gamified staking and NFT tie-ins are already pulling in early momentum. But it's the setup that's attracting smart money: Ethereum compatibility, real-time rewards, and zero reliance on hype tweets or dev promises. But others are buying Layer Brett—because it offers the same ecosystem exposure, with way more upside. Ethereum still dominates on fundamentals, and the price outlook remains solid. But when big wallets start looking elsewhere, it's not because ETH is weak—it's because smaller tokens offer more room to run. Layer Brett makes sense as a volatility play. In a cycle that rewards early entries, the smart money isn't just holding ETH. It's hedging with tokens built for breakout speed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum remains in a corrective phase after failing to break convincingly above its all-time high near $4.9K. The price has slipped below key supports, raising doubts about short-term momentum. The coming sessions are likely to determine whether ETH maintains its broader bullish trajectory or enters a deeper correction. The asset has now pulled back toward the midline support around $4.2K, which has repeatedly acted as a key demand zone. A decisive break below $4.2K would likely expose the $3.8K region, which overlaps with the sell-side liquidity pocket and prior consolidation levels. Conversely, if buyers hold this level, ETH could consolidate before mounting another attempt toward the $4.8K resistance zone, keeping the broader bullish structure intact. On the 4-hour timeframe, ETH has broken below its steeper ascending trendline, though the broader channel midline near $4.2K continues to provide crucial support. This has placed the market in a consolidation range bounded by $4.2K support and $4.8K resistance. However, if buyers defend this support and reclaim the $4.6K swing high, momentum could quickly reverse, with liquidity targets at $4.8K and potentially beyond. The liquidation heatmap highlights where leveraged positions are clustered, offering insight into which levels are most likely to attract price in the short term. The heatmap currently shows a dense liquidity cluster between $4.8K and $5K, where aggressive short positions were previously trapped. This remains a significant upside target, suggesting that any bullish push could aim to sweep remaining short liquidations in this zone. If sellers regain control, these levels could serve as downside magnets, accelerating further corrections. Sign-up FREE to receive our extended daily market update and coin analysis report</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Analysts point to growing demand from institutions, particularly as Ethereum solidifies its place in decentralized finance (DeFi), tokenization, and real-world asset adoption. The recent spike in Ethereum futures trading volume reinforces market confidence, while network upgrades focused on scalability and gas fee reduction continue to strengthen its position as the backbone of Web3 infrastructure. XRP remains a reliable favorite for investors seeking exposure to efficient payments and cross-border settlement. Trading at $2.81, XRP has held this level firmly despite broader market volatility. Positive regulatory news, particularly clarity around XRP's legal standing in the United States, has fueled renewed optimism. Institutional payment corridors across Asia and Latin America are also increasingly integrating RippleNet technology, further expanding its real-world utility. Ethereum's upward momentum suggests the potential to retest its all-time high above $4,600. Meanwhile, XRP is consolidating but poised for a breakout should buying pressure intensify. Crypto markets thrive on narratives; for Ethereum, it's institutional adoption and DeFi expansion, while for XRP, it's the regulatory clarity that gives legitimacy to its cross-border payment solutions. Ethereum whales have steadily increased their holdings, signaling confidence in ETH's long-term trajectory. Similarly, XRP's whale wallets have shown accumulation during recent price consolidations. However, large-cap coins typically deliver steadier but smaller percentage gains, which has fueled a rotation of capital into presale tokens like MAGAX, where growth potential is significantly higher. Moonshot MAGAX is positioning itself as a hybrid token that blends meme culture with real-world utility. Its AI-powered ecosystem is designed to reward viral content creators, effectively turning internet culture into a monetizable economy. At just $0.00027 in presale, analysts suggest MAGAX could deliver outsized gains compared to ETH or XRP. With deflationary tokenomics and staking rewards, MAGAX offers a sustainable growth model, unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype. At just $0.00027 in presale, analysts suggest MAGAX could deliver outsized gains compared to ETH or XRP. With deflationary tokenomics and staking rewards, MAGAX offers a sustainable growth model — unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype. Combined with the project's successful Certik Audit Certificate, which validates its smart contract security, confidence in MAGAX continues to build. As Ethereum pushes toward $4,600 and XRP consolidates around $3, MAGAX presents the kind of asymmetric opportunity retail investors look for in 2025 — high potential, low entry cost, and strong fundamentals backed by verified security.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But wait until you hear what Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse thinks is next for crypto. Keep reading to discover why Ripple's boss predicts such explosive growth for crypto, his insights on Ripple's own token, $XRP, and how you can position yourself for this potentially outrageous rally by loading up on the best altcoins to buy now. He explained that macroeconomic pressures on fiat are all but certain to intensify in the coming years, which could push traditional currencies toward devaluation and long-term instability. Amid such uncertainty, digital assets provide more than just hope; they're built specifically to plug the holes in the global financial system, offering transparency, efficiency, and inflation-resistant store of value that fiat currencies simply can't match. All in all, with prominent industry voices bullish on crypto's long-term growth, everyday investors will fare extremely well if they simply exercise patience during slightly deeper consolidations like the one we're seeing now. In fact, now's the perfect time to beef up your crypto portfolio with low-cap, high-upside tokens that are well-positioned to ride the upcoming boom. While altcoins continue to dominate crypto discussions, the meme coin segment alone has grown by more than 70% in the past year, proving there's so much more juice in it than many realize. $SNORT powers the Snorter Bot, a new Telegram-native trading bot designed to level the playing field between institutional players and everyday meme coin traders. As a result, you'll finally get the chance to participate in those early meme coin pumps, where life-changing gains are usually made. Snorter offers protection against a wide range of on-chain threats, including front-running, rug pulls, honeypots, and even advanced sandwich attacks. By buying $SNORT, you're positioning yourself to ride the adoption of Snorter Bot while unlocking a slew of exclusive benefits along the way: Visit Snorter Token's official website for more information. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) might not have a shiny whitepaper or game-changing technology, but its absurd mission to overthrow Dogecoin as the best meme coin on the planet has already gathered plenty of hype and community support. The project has raised over $1.66M in early investor funding, proving that degen investors are hungry for a wild, rage-fueled meme coin. Believe it or not, Maxi is Dogecoin's distant cousin. That's when Maxi found solace in the gym and in front of the charts, where he built big muscles and chased even bigger gains. Now, backed by a fierce community of $MAXI holders who all subscribe to his mantra of ‘never skip leg day, never skip a pump', the dawg is ready to take the market by storm. Join the tribe by buying $MAXI at just $0.0002545 apiece. Hurry up, though, because the price will increase in just a few hours. Check out Maxi Doge's official website for more information. For instance, BlackRock recently snapped up more than $314M worth of Ethereum, while Goldman Sachs and Jane Street grabbed a combined 192.5K $ETH. More notably, Thomas Lee, a significant voice in the crypto space, explained that while Wall Street once dismissed Ethereum for being slower than Solana or Sui, institutions are now betting big on it because of its ability to deliver 100% uptime – something non-negotiable for big-money players. ‘If ETH stays above $4,800, we could see a really big cycle,' Lee added. That prediction looks even stronger when you consider that a massive $4.65B worth of shorts would be liquidated if Ethereum retests its all-time high. Although $ETH has been red all week, the drop isn't as bad as it looks – because its weekly candle remains within last week's range. According to the technical playbook, this forms a classic ‘inside candle' pattern, and a breakout here could trigger an explosive rally. With Ripple's CEO projecting a nearly tenfold increase in crypto's valuation by 2030, the stage is set for promising altcoins like $SNORT, $MAXI, and $ETH to shine in the upcoming bull run. Also, none of the above is financial advice, and you must always do your own research before investing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US Department of Commerce has begun posting macroeconomic data on public blockchains – the administration's latest move in putting its money, or in this case national economic data, where its mouth is as regards embracing the use of innovative technology. Best-known for powering cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, and increasingly used in fields such as supply-chain management, blockchain is a distributed-ledger technology (DLT) that securely records transactions in ‘blocks' linked together using cryptographic hashes to form a tamper-proof ‘chain'. It allows multiple participants to verify, store and share data without need for a central authority. The Department of Commerce announced this week (28 August) that it will begin posting real gross domestic product (GDP) data on blockchain, starting with July 2025 data. The accuracy and integrity of US economic data has become an increasingly high profile topic since Trump returned to the White House in January. Earlier this month (August) he fired Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner Erika McEntarfer after a monthly jobs report infuriated him, posting on his social media platform Truth Social: ‘In my opinion, today's Jobs Numbers were RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad… But, the good news is, our Country is doing GREAT! “We are making America's economic truth immutable and globally accessible like never before, cementing our role as the blockchain capital of the world.” The department published what it describes as an ‘official hash' of the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)'s quarterly GDP data release for 2025's second quarter – and, in some cases, the topline GDP figure for 2025's second quarter – to nine blockchains in total. Data was also further disseminated through coordination with two ‘oracles' (oracles are entities that connect blockchains to external systems) while three exchanges ‘helped facilitate the Department's publishing', the announcement detailed. The nine blockchains are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, TRON, Stellar, Avalanche, Arbitrum One, Polygon PoS and Optimism. Howard Ludnick: the commerce secretary posted a 55 second video on X (formerly Twitter) promoting the quarterly GDP data release and use of blockchain In a blogpost published on the same day (28 August), Chainlink stated that ‘new Chainlink Data Feeds [are now] securely deliver[ing] critical information around key US economic data onchain, including Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, and Real Final Sales to Private Domestic Purchasers.' ‘By bringing macroeconomic data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis onchain, Chainlink is showcasing how trusted oracle networks can serve as critical infrastructure connecting public institutions with blockchain markets, unlocking new innovations while supporting compliance and regulatory progress in the United States,' Chainlink stated. ‘Without question, this marks a critical step forward in the public sector's embrace of decentralised infrastructure,' Pyth stated in its own blogpost (28 August). ‘The integrity of economic data is essential to global markets, and bringing this data onchain opens up new frontiers for transparency, accessibility, and composability across DeFi [decentralised finance], enterprise use cases and public accountability,' Pyth added, stating that ‘this new initiative reflects a deliberate effort by the US government to harness cryptographic tools to increase confidence in public information systems.'</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin and Ether ETFs saw outflows on Friday after the Fed reported rising core inflation, driven in part by Trump's tariff policies. Spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs recorded outflows on Friday as the Federal Reserve released key inflation data showing price pressures are creeping higher under President Donald Trump's trade policies. According to SoSoValue data, Ether (ETH) ETFs saw a net outflow of $164.64 million, reversing five straight days of inflows that had added more than $1.5 billion to the asset class. Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs also turned negative with $126.64 million in net outflows, their first daily loss since Aug. 22. Fidelity's FBTC recorded the steepest single-day outflow at $66.2 million among Bitcoin ETFs. Related: 92 crypto-related ETPs in the works: ‘Floodgates to open soon' The report, which matched forecasts, came amid growing evidence that Trump's tariff regime is adding pressure on core prices by raising import costs, according to CNBC. Trump's White House has imposed a baseline 10% tariff on all imports and targeted additional categories through reciprocal duties. Though energy prices helped keep broader inflation in check, services jumped 3.6% year-over-year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the ever-changing world of cryptocurrency, whale movements are having a significant impact on where people put their money, especially in utility-driven altcoins such as Remittix. Investors are increasingly interested in projects that can be used in real life, moving away from assets that have no clear use. In this article, we're going to look at how whale activity shapes market trends, what makes Remittix stand out, and what this means for the future of crypto investments. Whale movements have always been a big deal in the crypto world. These large holders can send shockwaves through the market with their buying and selling actions. It's almost like they have a sixth sense for where the market is going. What's striking is the growing interest in utility-driven altcoins over speculative cryptocurrencies. Projects that have tangible applications, like Remittix, are emerging as the new favorites. Because they align more with the real-world demand for practical use cases, rather than relying on the hype surrounding meme coins or fleeting trends. Remittix is making headlines as a key player among altcoins, catching the attention of both retail and institutional investors. It's positioned as a PayFi solution, streamlining crypto-to-fiat transactions and addressing inefficiencies in traditional remittance services. On one hand, they can show that there is confidence and stability in the market. With crypto payroll solutions gaining traction, stablecoins are becoming a more attractive option for paying salaries. However, the road isn't smooth for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Europe looking to integrate altcoins into their operations. They'll have to comply with the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, which demands transparency and operational oversight. The cryptocurrency market is at an interesting juncture. Whale movements are significantly nudging the scene toward utility-driven altcoins like Remittix. As investors turn their gaze to projects that offer something tangible, the landscape is evolving. For those looking to capitalize on these trends, understanding whale activity and the potential of utility-driven altcoins will be key to navigating this market.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Global efforts to develop central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are sparking sharp debate, raising fears over state control of money and savings. Critics, however, warn that programmable digital money could give governments sweeping new powers. CBDCs are digital versions of national currencies, issued on permissioned blockchains operated by central banks. Unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies, they function within a closed system where officials control access and policy. That structure consequently fuels concern among analysts who fear the tools may be used for surveillance. “Not all digital currencies are the same,” said Susie Violet Ward, financial analyst and co-founder of Bitcoin Policy UK. She argued CBDCs represent “the weaponization of money in its purest form.” Ward noted that programmable features could allow central banks to set expiry dates on savings. In her view, such design options would let governments decide how and when citizens spend. The European Union is pressing forward with its digital euro project. Meanwhile, the United States is rejecting CBDCs and focusing on private stablecoin development. This policy gap highlights competing visions for the future of digital finance.

On January 23, he signed an executive order prohibiting any creation, circulation, or use of a CBDC in the United States. Further, he cited threats to financial stability, privacy, and national sovereignty as reasons for the move. ECB President Christine Lagarde said the digital euro is expected to launch in October 2025. She also stressed that it would coexist with cash and offer privacy protections to address fears of state overreach. Reports suggest European officials are even exploring whether to build the system on major public blockchains like Ethereum. Other nations are advancing their own CBDC pilots, often raising similar concerns. Observers also quickly spotted features that allowed officials to freeze or reduce user funds in digital wallets. Proponents argue that CBDCs could increase financial inclusion and lower transaction costs. They warn that centralized systems risk eroding civil liberties if governments abuse their authority.
