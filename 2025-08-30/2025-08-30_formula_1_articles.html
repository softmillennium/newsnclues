F1 Academy Highlights: 2025 Dutch GP Race One

2025 Dutch GP Qualifying: Verstappen frustrated with Norris in Q2

Matt Youson takes a look at the different pit stop and tyre options that are available to the teams in the Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort.

McLaren's MCL39 is proving to be an excellent all-rounder – but the thing it likes best is medium-speed corners, and there's a lot of those at Zandvoort. The result, in qualifying, was Oscar Piastri pipping Lando Norris to pole, as the papaya cars locked out the front row.

Behind them, it's more of a Stroopwafel-fight. Max Verstappen will start third – but Isack Hadjar did a magnificent job to join him on the second row, ahead of George Russell and the Ferraris.

On race day there will be different tyre strategies in play, and capricious weather around to mix things up. So let's take a look at the tactical options the teams have when the lights go out…

F1 Academy Highlights: 2025 Dutch GP Race One

2025 Dutch GP Qualifying: Verstappen frustrated with Norris in Q2

After setting the pace during Friday's first practice hour, Lando Norris again led the way in Free Practice 2 at the Dutch Grand Prix.

Lando Norris continued his pace-setting form through to a busy second practice at the Dutch Grand Prix, the Briton going fastest after earlier topping the timesheets in FP1.

In a session that saw two red flag phases, Norris put himself on top with his lap of 1m 09.890s, putting him 0.087s clear of Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso in second while the other McLaren of Oscar Piastri was just two thousandths of a second behind the Spaniard in third.

It was a more challenging outing for Alonso's team mate Lance Stroll, who suffered a heavy crash that resulted in the first stoppage. Fortunately the Canadian reported that he was okay.

Meanwhile another red flag was thrown when Alex Albon beached his Williams in the gravel later on in the hour, while Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar sparked a Virtual Safety Car when he pulled off track with an issue.

To watch all the action from Free Practice 2 in Zandvoort, hit go on the video player above.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Isack Hadjar will start Sunday's Dutch Grand Prix from fourth place after securing a Formula 1 career-best grid position. Isack Hadjar registered the best Qualifying result of his fledgling Formula 1 career, as he set the fourth-fastest time on Saturday. His previous best result was a sixth place in Qualifying for the Monaco Grand Prix. “This morning, I had a really good feeling, but we knew it would be very hard to reach Q3, and actually, both of us [Racing Bulls drivers] managed to reach Q3. “He [team mate Liam Lawson] was really pushing me hard, and I put it all on the line on that final lap and put it all together. I think the car is really healthy around here. Liam [Lawson] was quite fast on the long run on Friday, so it gives us a lot of confidence going into the race.” Lawson will start from eighth place on Sunday, but was left frustrated by a lack of improvement between Q2 and Q3. It was very promising out there throughout Qualifying,” said the New Zealander. “I don't really know why, but we went slower in Q3, so there's some stuff to look into. I think we were feeling quite good after Q2 and naturally, everyone makes a step into Q3, but for some reason, we didn't make a step. It's obviously a tricky lap, and getting the balance right with this wind is tough. It's frustrating, because I think we had good potential. It's going to be a hard race, that's for sure.</p>
