US companies are poised to boost their debt levels to help fund a $1 trillion wave of acquisitions, a reversal after years of scaling back their borrowings. 

Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. this week said it's buying coffeemaker JDE Peet's NV and funding the deal with a €16.2 billion ($19.0 billion) bridge loan. AT&T Inc. said on Tuesday it's buying spectrum licenses from EchoStar Corp. for about $23 billion, a move that will probably be at least partly funded with bondsBloomberg Terminal. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Trump's efforts to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook could jeopardize the central bank's independence, according to longtime investor Rebecca Patterson. "We shouldn't ignore this at all. This is a big deal what's going on," the former Bridgewater Associates chief investment strategist told CNBC's "Fast Money" this week. Patterson, now a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, has spent more than two decades analyzing how politics and policy shape global markets. She cautions that politicizing the Fed could erode its legitimacy and have long-term economic consequences. Drawing from her economics research on countries that have lost institutional integrity, Patterson notes a familiar pattern: weaker stock market performances, higher inflation and long-term yields, depreciating currencies, and reduced foreign direct investment. She warns replacing Cook would likely be the Trump's first move to stack the Fed with loyal policymakers who will push for lower rates. Patterson thinks markets may initially react positively to lower rates. However, she warns the longer-term effects could be damaging. "In the short-term, investors might reason that lower rates supporting growth are good for earnings," she wrote in a special email to CNBC. "Over time, though, sustained higher inflation is going to hurt consumption which will get reflected in earnings expectations." "Our moment might not come as quickly or easily," she said during the interview. "But looking at other countries who have gone down this road, [it] tells us where we're headed if we're not careful."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than a year after the Powerball jackpot last topped $1 billion, the prize has climbed back to that level ahead of Saturday night's drawing at 10:59 p.m. The last $1 billion jackpot was claimed in April 2024, and the biggest since then was a $526.5 million win in March. To claim the prize, you'll need to beat odds of 1 in 292,201,338 and match all six numbers, including the red Powerball. Smaller prizes are also available, including $1 million for matching all five white balls without the Powerball. Winners can choose between two payout options: the full jackpot spread out as annual payments over 30 years or a lump-sum cash option worth just under half the advertised prize. No matter which option you select, the Internal Revenue Service takes a cut. Winnings are considered taxable income, so 24% is withheld immediately. On top of that, most states levy their own income taxes, ranging from 2.5% to 10.9%. Eight states don't tax lottery winnings at all: California, Florida, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming. It's worth noting that five states don't participate in Powerball: Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Nevada and Utah.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's effort to sack Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is about more than firing someone: It's a maneuver that, if successful, would mark a seismic shift for an institution that for ages had been considered above politics. He has berated central bankers for not lowering rates, threatened to remove Chair Jerome Powell, and now has taken the unprecedented step of actually attempting to unseat Cook. However, legal scholars as well as financial market experts and present and former Fed officials say Trump's moves not only threaten to make the Fed more political but also would undermine key pillars of the American financial system. "We are on a road that is going to lead to the erosion of central bank independence," said Kathryn Judge, a professor at Columbia Law School. Independence in the Fed's case is a term used to describe its freedom from outside political influence to determine monetary policy that is best for the U.S. economy. This is particularly the case if those decisions are unpopular, such as when the Federal Open Market Committee raises interest rates to bring down inflation. The seven-member Board of Governors, for instance, has regulatory and enforcement power over banks. "The most serious danger, I think, to people's being able to have confidence in the Fed board is what Trump is himself doing," said Robert Hockett, a professor at Cornell Law School. "Because if Trump succeeds with this, then it suggests the Fed board is nothing but a rubber stamp. It just basically tells us that any nutjob who happens to get into the White House will be setting monetary policy henceforth." The effect, Hockett added, is that "we can have the same kind of hyperinflations in the future that banana republics in Latin America have classically had when their dictators have set monetary policy, or that Turkey has experienced in recent years because its dictator has set monetary policy." For the administration's part, Trump's lieutenants largely say they believe in Fed independence but see the central bank as institution run amok that needs reigning in. However, the president has conceded he will litmus test nominees for board vacancies on their willingness to lower rates, and he in the past has advocated getting a say in the Fed's rate decisions among other measures that might be considered intrusions into the central bank's space. "I don't think it's an undermining of Fed independence. I just think it's the fact the system needs a wholesale reevaluation and President Trump just does things unconventionally," said Joseph LaVorgna, a senior economist during the first Trump term and now counselor to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Mohamed El-Erian, the former Pimco executive and now chief economic advisor at Allianz, recently advocated that Powell step down as chair to avoid just the kind of battle over independence that is happening now. "This is the exact world that I was worried about," El-Erian said Friday on CNBC. "The Fed is vulnerable on so many different fronts, and I fear now that we've started going down this road that I really dread." Among the reforms El-Erian spoke of included taking after the Bank of England and allowing "external members" onto its policymaking group "that bring a difference perspective and that help reduce the risk of groupthink." Also, he said the Fed should reconsider its 2% inflation target, something that Powell repeatedly has said is not on the table. However, critics say that what Trump is talking about goes beyond mere structural reforms. "This is really a story about trying to undo what had been 90 years of Fed independence," former Fed Vice Chair Roger Ferguson said on CNBC. "The whole goal was to give the Fed independence in doing this very important thing, which is setting monetary policy. And now, for the first time, we're seeing a direct effort to undermine that." How successful Trump will be in doing so is another matter. Currently, he has two appointees, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, on the board. Stephen Miran is awaiting Senate confirmation to fill the seat vacated by Adriana Kugler's resignation. Should Powell leave next May when his term as chair runs out, that would create another vacancy and give the president five seats. However, counting on all those members as automatic votes is risky. Both Waller and Bowman have shown strong independent streaks, taking both out-of-consensus hawkish and dovish positions depending on circumstances, and are unlikely to be "little apparatchiks for Trump," the Cornell professor Hockett said. Also potentially standing in the way is a series of court tests that will focus on whether Trump has "cause" to remove Cook or anyone else. If the president succeeds, it could have wide-ranging effects on the economy and markets, said Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI. "We think the baseline case at this point should be that there is very substantial Trumpification of the Fed through 2026 and – while this does not automatically correspond to a big lurch in policy and practice – we need to very seriously consider the likelihood that this leads to a rupture with past practice and a materially different reaction function with important implications for markets," Guha said in a recent note. "I do think that long term confidence in our central bank and hence in our currency will take yet another hit." Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More companies are recalling tens of thousands of packages of imported shrimp sold at Walmart, Kroger and other U.S. stores because they may contain radioactive contamination, according to federal notices. AquaStar USA Corp. of Seattle is recalling more than 26,000 packages of refrigerated cocktail shrimp sold at Walmart stores in 27 states between July 31 and Aug. 16. The company is also recalling about 18,000 bags of Kroger-branded cooked, medium peeled, tail-off shrimp sold at stores in 17 states between July 24 and Aug. 11. At the same time, H&N Group, a wholesale seafood distributor in Vernon, California, is recalling more than 17,000 cases of frozen shrimp sold to grocery stores on the East Coast, according to a notice from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The products have been pulled because they may be contaminated with Cesium-137, a radioactive isotope that is a byproduct of nuclear reactions. The risk appears to be small, but the shrimp could pose a "potential health concern" for people exposed to low levels of Cesium-137 over time, FDA officials said. The FDA issued a safety alert this month warning consumers not to eat certain frozen shrimp imported from PT. Bahari Makmur Sejati, an Indonesian company doing business as BMS Foods. Cesium-137 was detected in shipping containers from the company sent to U.S. ports and in a sample of frozen breaded shrimp. Bahari Makmur Sejati to a new import alert for chemical contamination to stop products from this firm from coming into the U.S. None of the shrimp that triggered alerts or tested positive for Cesium-137 was released for sale, the FDA said. But other shipments sent to stores may have been manufactured under conditions that allowed the products to become contaminated, the agency said. Officials with U.S. Customs and Border Protection first detected the potential radioactive contamination in shipping containers sent to U.S. ports in Los Angeles, Houston, Miami and Savannah, Georgia. Customs officials alerted the FDA, which conducted tests of packaged shrimp and confirmed Cesium-137 in a single sample. The level of Cesium-137 detected in the frozen shrimp was about 68 becquerels per kilogram, a measure of radioactivity. That is far below the FDA's level of 1,200 becquerels per kilogram that could trigger the need for health protections. It is unusual to see this concentration of Cesium-137 in shrimp, said Steve Biegalski, who chairs the Nuclear and Radiological Engineering and Medical Physics program at the Georgia Institute of Technology. "We sometimes can see Cesium-137 from historic nuclear weapons fallout, nuclear accidents such as Fukushima or Chernobyl, but the levels in the environment are super, super, super low right now and cannot explain what's going on here," Biegalski said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge on Friday temporarily blocked the Trump administration from carrying out speedy deportations of undocumented migrants detained in the interior of the United States. President Donald Trump promised to engineer a massive deportation operation during his 2024 campaign if voters returned him to the White House. And he set a goal of carrying out 1 million deportations a year in his second term. But U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, D.C., suggested the Trump administration's expanded use of the expedited removal of migrants is trampling on individuals' due process rights. "In defending this skimpy process, the Government makes a truly startling argument: that those who entered the country illegally are entitled to no process under the Fifth Amendment, but instead must accept whatever grace Congress affords them," Cobb wrote in a 48-page opinion issued Friday night. "Were that right, not only noncitizens, but everyone would be at risk." The Department of Homeland Security announced shortly after Trump came to office in January that it was expanding the use of expedited removal, the fast-track deportation of undocumented migrants who have been in the U.S. less than two years. Before the Trump administration's push to expand such speedy deportations, expedited removal was only used for migrants who were stopped within 100 miles of the border and who had been in the U.S. for less than 14 days. "It merely holds that in applying the statute to a huge group of people living in the interior of the country who have not previously been subject to expedited removal, the Government must afford them due process," she wrote. She added that "prioritizing speed over all else will inevitably lead the Government to erroneously remove people via this truncated process." Cobb earlier this month agreed to temporarily block the Trump administration's efforts to expand fast-track deportations of immigrants who legally entered the U.S. under a process known as humanitarian parole — a ruling that could benefit hundreds of thousands of people. In that case the judge said Homeland Security exceeded its statutory authority in its effort to expand expedited removal for many immigrants. The judge said those immigrants are facing perils that outweigh any harm from "pressing pause" on the administration's plans. Since May, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have positioned themselves in hallways to arrest people after judges accept government requests to dismiss deportation cases. Although fast-track deportations can be put on hold by filing an asylum claim, people may be unaware of that right and, even if they are, can be swiftly removed if they fail an initial screening.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Julian Becerra first learned about retatrutide while scrolling social media. Becerra ("not a bodybuilder by any means at all, but I do like to look good with my shirt off") bought himself a substance labeled "retatrutide" online, a powder mixed with water, and injected it into his muscles with a syringe, just as Weiss and other bodybuilders online described. Retatrutide is a GLP-1 drug, in the same family as Ozempic (semaglutide) and Mounjaro (tirzepatide). It was developed by the pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, and it is unique because it mimics three hunger hormones (GLP, GIP, and glucagon), while similar drugs on the market target one or two. In theory, that means more staggering weight-loss results and potentially other benefits. Doctors and researchers are already jokingly referring to retatrutide as the "King Kong" for weight loss because early results in clinical trials suggest it rivals bariatric surgery, and it seems to protect more lean muscle mass. Here's the catch: Eli Lilly has not yet finished clinical trials on retatrutide. It's widely regarded as a crucial piece in Eli Lilly's strategy for taking the lion's share of the world's $100 billion weight-loss drug industry. And yet, over the past year, retatrutide has been gaining traction on TikTok, YouTube, Reddit, and Instagram, particularly in fitness circles. People chasing chiseled physiques buy powder labeled "reta" or "ret" online from research labs, which are legally allowed to manufacture compounds for research only. Their products come with a caveat that they are "not for human consumption." These consumers appear comfortable mixing their drugs up themselves. They describe reta as a "next-gen" GLP-1 drug, saying the injectable they are taking helped them cut fat and get lean without the muscle wasting that many people experience on Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, or Zepbound. Reddit threads are filled with questions and advice on which labs to avoid for safety and how to dose the drug depending on your goals. People describe asking ChatGPT to personalize the advice. Post-Ozempic, the gray market for unofficial weight loss solutions is taking on a life of its own among people who are highly skeptical of the healthcare institutions normally involved in drugmaking and prescribing. There are crackdown efforts: The US Food and Drug Administration says people should buy their drugs from licensed pharmacies, with valid prescriptions. A Brookings report earlier this year showed the majority of counterfeit GLP-1s come from wholesale manufacturers in China, outside of US oversight. TikTok recently started banning videos that promote retatrutide. Unregulated drugs are often inconsistently dosed and have been found to carry contaminants like formaldehyde. Drugmaker Eli Lilly told Business Insider in a statement that "anyone purporting to sell retatrutide for human use is breaking the law." The company added: "No one should consider taking anything claiming to be retatrutide outside of a Lilly-sponsored clinical trial." Creators make new profiles, labs fly under the radar. Big pharmaceutical companies, government regulators, and doctors have little power to intervene as people look to DIY their way into new bodies. Around 2023, GLP-1 knock-offs entered the mainstream via regulated, US-based compounding pharmacies. People couldn't access the brand-name weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Mounjaro because high demand triggered shortages. So they turned to compounders, which have legal discretion to make cheaper versions of approved drugs when access is limited. Patients were presented with the option to get their life-changing weight-loss medication for way less than $1,000 a month, side-stepping insurance. Plus, people who weren't eligible for GLP-1 prescriptions because they didn't have diabetes or obesity were able to get their hands on compounded versions through telehealth companies that asked very few questions. Unlike compounding pharmacies, they exist outside the realm of pharmaceutical regulation. Anecdotal evidence suggests websites selling research peptides were increasingly catering to gymgoers, selling peptides that promise to tan skin, curb hair loss, and — yes — cut fat. Some sites offer the bacteriostatic water and syringes people need to mix their own dosages at home. Mr. Olympia competitor Nick "The Mutant" Walker posted about retatrutide earlier this year, saying he had tried it out before a couple of big bodybuilding shows and it worked "tremendously" to shred fat. Derek Munro, the bodybuilder who produces the podcast "More Plates More Dates" and has appeared on Joe Rogan's podcast, was another early pioneer. Max Radovanic lost 230 pounds over a period of about two and a half years, first by dieting, then with assistance from semaglutide and retatrutide. He first heard about reta from Munro, a few months after his insurance kicked him off his semaglutide pill, Rybelsus. That was frustrating, and the 22-year-old panicked, worried about a rebound. With a few clicks on a peptide website, he said he was able to find compounded semaglutide and then retatrutide. He buys medications in bulk from a research lab online. Alongside reta, he lists another not-yet-for-sale drug from Novo Nordisk, called cagrilintide, or cagri, and a popular concoction: cagri-reta, blending two in-development GLP-1s from two different drugmakers. In just a few months, Radovanic says he's amassed thousands of customers across North America. Becerra, the 24-year-old mentioned earlier, is passionate about optimizing men's hormones, as part of a bigger quest to boost testosterone, masculinity, and male self-confidence. He teamed up with a friend to cofound Overtime Men's Health in Tampa, Florida, joining the blossoming industry of men's health clinics. They source retatrutide from a compounder's "sister company" that is "in place because of the FDA restrictions," Becerra said. They sell it online alongside a smorgasbord of products that promise to nourish masculinity — testosterone, creatine, and peptides like BPC-157. They said compounding pharmacies play no role in this trade since retatrutide is not an approved drug. The FDA told Business Insider in a statement that it is "actively working" to protect consumers from counterfeit GLP-1s through "public awareness, enforcement actions, and collaboration with other agencies." Last spring, FDA Special Agents worked with the Department of Justice to arrest a woman in New York for selling fake Ozempic and pressed charges against a doctor in Kentucky who was selling "lab research" semaglutide, calling it "Meal Prep" in Venmo payments. The FDA also said it has been working with Customs and Border Protection, "intercepting illegal products at ports." The FDA is unequivocal that "retatrutide and cagrilintide cannot be used in compounding under federal law." "These are not components of FDA-approved drugs and have not been found safe and effective for any condition," the agency said in drug safety information posted online. They tout improved insulin sensitivity, nodding to the drug's original purpose, which is to help control blood sugar for patients with type 2 diabetes. Studies conducted on patients with obesity and diabetes suggest that retatrutide may be better at zeroing in on fat, preserving more lean muscle mass than earlier generations of injectable GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Mounjaro. Patients in the clinical trials, who all have diabetes and/or obesity, also had fewer complaints about nausea and diarrhea. "What's interesting about it is people don't just lose weight and reach a plateau, they just keep losing weight," Dr. Eric Topol, a cardiologist and leading longevity expert, told Business Insider after looking at Eli Lilly's clinical trial results. It found just two European labs, with the bulk of peptide shipments pouring in from Chinese factories to distributors in the US. The amino acid formula for retatrutide is easily searchable on the internet, but how easy is it to manufacture that chemistry? The Brookings report found that counterfeit versions of semaglutide are not perfect copies of what Novo Nordisk manufactures, which is more like a natural hormone. The copies are manufactured using "solid state" peptide synthesis, and some have had contaminants like formaldehyde left inside. A whole cottage industry is springing up to test these research compounds. Serial investor Michael Carter, who has founded and run various gaming and software startups, recently started a company called Finrick, which he says is "creating the market force for these vendors to care about safety." He said most of the retatrutide samples he has tested are the real deal, the "exact same thing" that Eli Lilly is making, but there's really no way to be totally sure. Doctors say that we need to learn more about the safety profile of these drugs and better understand the possible dangers for each patient, depending on their medical history. We saw with the first wave of GLP-1 drugs that some people had unpredictable reactions to Ozempic or Mounjaro, with life-altering side effects like stomach paralysis and sudden blindness. There is, of course, a serious risk of contamination and bacterial infection when you're getting powder from an online clinic that isn't subject to regulations. Plus, there's the contamination risk of mixing things up on your own, outside the clean rooms that pharma normally uses. "I got burned with fake reta again," is a common refrain in TikTok videos and Reddit forums. People pile in, offering names of labs they trust. Business Insider reached out to some of the most popular labs cited on social media, but we didn't receive a response. At the popular testosterone and hormone clinic Gameday Men's Health, chief medical officer Dr. Haleem Mohammed said he's been seeing a consistent stream of guys coming in who are taking "ret." "Let's toss that vial and wait until it's gone through the trials and is available," Mohammed told his Miami patients. He's also frustrated by how quickly and easily they can get research chemicals online that don't have the same safety checks that any pharmacy would require. "Unless you're a lab rat, or planning on being one, I wouldn't recommend it," Mohammed said. He's seen issues with malnutrition in people taking these research peptides and electrolyte imbalances that could eventually lead to dangerous heart issues, if left unaddressed. "You get a vial in the mail and you have no idea what's in there and there's no clinician involved whatsoever," he said. Dr. Christle Guevarra, a licensed physician and powerlifter who works with bodybuilders and fitness enthusiasts at RP Strength, started hearing about retatrutide about six months ago. She said she discourages them from using retatrutide — she worries about contamination and all the unknowns that come with an unapproved drug — but tries to meet patients where they are to reduce harm. "I can't gate-keep people from going to find information," Guevarra told Business Insider. Some bodybuilders (controversially) take insulin, an anabolic hormone, in the hopes of building muscle and improving nutrient uptake in their muscles. "I think it really is important now more than ever that we figure out a way to do a better job as physicians to check in on things like side effects, on things like muscle loss, on things like, 'how are your lifestyle changes going?' to make sure that our patients are safe," Guevarra said. That retatrutide is booming before it's even on the market underscores the huge demand for muscle preservation to go with weight loss. Doctors have been raising concerns for years that, while GLP-1 drugs have myriad benefits, they trigger such rapid weight loss that it's hard to preserve muscle or even have the energy to work out. Less muscle can also, ironically, impact your metabolism, affecting digestion and making it harder to stay at a stable weight. Analysts project that muscle-preserving drugs could generate $30 billion by 2035. In the meantime, there's a gap, and a world of fitness influencers and online clinics flooding in to fill it, offering advice on how to build muscle. Private wellness clinics offer pricey body composition scans to gauge a person's muscle-fat ratio — far too costly for a physician to universally recommend and not deemed essential by insurance. Back home, scrolling online, you may come across a buzzy new GLP-1 that costs $100 for a month's supply, and supposedly preserves muscle while melting fat. You find hundreds of other social media creators who say it changed their lives. Take Radovanic, who experienced incredible weight loss on a brand-name GLP-1, then lost insurance coverage for the drug as a result. Earlier this week, TikTok banned the words "ret," "reta," and "retatrutide" from search, pointing to its community guidelines, which ban dangerous weight loss behaviors and marketing of weight loss products. They started posting about "redatrutide" instead, some mocking the censorship as "big pharma's" latest intervention.</p>
