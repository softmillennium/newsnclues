                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On August 29, 2025, the stars of Hallmark's blockbuster “Three Wise Men” franchise wrapped filming their third — and likely final — with an emotional group hug caught on video. Production manager Rob Lycar posted touching footage of stars Tyler Hynes, Andrew Walker, Paul Campbell, Margaret Colin, and Kimberley Sustad gathering in a circle with Hallmark director Terry Ingram after three weeks of filming “Three Wisest Men.” Massive congratulations to Terry Ingram on his 50th Hallmark movie and thank you to the talented cast and crew for their hard work. We have an incredibly funny & heartwarming movie here!” A post shared by Rob Lycar (@lickylicks) Lycar added James Blunt's tearjerker “Goodbye My Lover” under his video of the primary cast huddled with Ingram, sharing their gratitude for each other and joking that Ingram could now “retire” after the incredible feat of directing 50 Hallmark movies. Lycar's followers swooned over the video, with many noting in the comments how “beautiful” it was to watch. A sequel, “Three Wiser Men and a Boy,” was Hallmark's second-most-watched movie of 2024, just behind the NFL-themed “Holiday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story,” which also starred Hynes. “Three Wisest Men” is scheduled to premiere as part of Hallmark Channel's 2025 Countdown to Christmas movie lineup, though an exact date has not been announced yet. Walker continued, “I think what's best for this story in particular — and the ‘Wise Men' franchise has been really good to all of us — is that I think that sometimes if you overdo it, it loses its allure.” But Walker said he foresees working again with Hynes, Campbell, and Sustad on unrelated projects in the future, telling EntertaimentNow that the group of tight-knit friends has already discussed other possibilities for collaboration. But first, they've got a highly anticipated movie to promote, completing their fun-loving, heartfelt “Wise Men” trilogy. “We're really happy to just get this third opportunity to do this, and to kind of, you know, tie it up with a bow and send it off and maybe create something fresh,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One year after premiering 'Conclave' in the Rockies, Edward Berger returned to unveil his latest film, a portrait of a gambling addict in Macao whose luck is running out. Few people in the film industry have had a more impressive last few years than Edward Berger, who directed 2022's All Quiet on the Western Front, for which he was Oscar-nominated, and 2024's Conclave, for which he should have been, and Colin Farrell, who starred in 2022's The Banshees of Inisherin, which brought him a long-overdue first Oscar nom, Thirteen Lives and The Batman, to say nothing of the 2024 limited series The Penguin, for which he is currently Emmy-nominated. Therefore, it was rather exciting to learn that the two had joined forces for Ballad of a Small Player, a film about a self-destructive gambling addict and con artist in present-day Macao who grows increasingly desperate as his luck runs out. Adapted by Rowan Joffe from Lawrence Osborne's 2014 novel of the same name, and also featuring Fala Chen and Tilda Swinton in supporting roles, Ballad had its world premiere at the Telluride Film Festival's Werner Herzog Theater on Friday night. 'Hamlet' Review: Riz Ahmed Tackles Shakespeare's Most Famous Hero in a Shaky Contemporary Version I'm pleased to report that it is a funny, sad, stylish and altogether entertaining time at the movies. It's also completely different from the two aforementioned Berger films, in terms of size and tone. Those were large-scale epics about matters of social consequence, and became across-the-board Oscar contenders, landing nine and eight noms, respectively. As far as awards, I suspect attention will largely center on Farrell's tour-de-force turn and Joffe's colorful screenplay, both of which could well be Oscar-nominated.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Guillermo del Toro‘s adaptation of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein launched at the Venice Film Festival this evening and the notices are coming in. Oscar Isaac stars as Dr. Victor Frankenstein, the brilliant but egotistical scientist who brings a creature (Jacob Elordi) to life in a monstrous experiment that ultimately leads to the undoing of both the creator and his tragic creation. ... With Oscar Isaac And Jacob Elordi Going All-In - Venice Film Festival Deadline's Pete Hammond praised the acting and directing: “[Del Toro's] love for monsters is unquestioned, and even though Frankenstein has been a horror staple for nearly a century in cinema, del Toro here turns it into a fascinating and thoughtful tale on what it means to be a human, and who is really the monster? He continued: “Elordi is very fine in quite a different kind of role for him, and physically he really fits the bill. Isaac is enormously fun to watch as he slips further into madness, with a fake leg, lots of prosthetics and makeup effects, and an ego with no end.” At 2 1/2 hours it perhaps might have been shortened, but del Toro's sandbox is so irresistible, the return to big Hollywood moviemaking so pronounced, it must be hard to stop. The Guardian described the film as “bombastic but watchable” in a three star review: “The visual style of the movie is utterly distinctive and unmistakably that of Del Toro: a series of lovely, intricate images, filigreed with infinitesimally exact cod-period detail; deep focus but also strangely depthless, like hi-tech stained glass or illustrated plates in a Victorian tome; pictures whose luxurious beauty underscores the film's reverence for the source material and for itself, but which for me impedes the energy of horror.” HeyUGuys also gave the film three stars: “Del Toro paints a picture of man's hubris and the monstrosity of those who relentlessly seek something with no consideration for anyone else. Perhaps he could have done this with a more nuanced touch, but subtlety has never been a Del Toro strongpoint. Geoffrey MacNab, writing for the UK's Independent, was ultimately unimpressed, saying “del Toro's elegant adaptation is all show and little substance” and that “Isaac's performance is mannered and uneven”: “Unfortunately, Frankenstein continually risks losing its footing. We know very quickly that the monster cannot die. For all Del Toro's formal mastery, this Frankenstein is ultimately short of the voltage needed really to bring it to life.” However, The Wrap was a big fan, saying: “The passion drips from every frame of del Toro's epic reimagining… It's a filmmaker returning to his roots at a time when he has the skills to make those roots grow into something huge and singular…His Frankenstein is a titanic piece of work, two and a half hours that bend Shelley's framework to contain nearly everything we've loved about this story of the brilliant but foolhardy scientist and his fearsome creation.” So too was The South China Morning Post which gave it 4.5/5 stars: “This ‘modern Prometheus' tale, to borrow from Shelley's subtitle, has been told many times on film, with varied results. But unquestionably, Del Toro's version is the most beautiful, perhaps the most definitive…Nodding to Milton's Paradise Lost, and the Fall of Man, Del Toro manages to create a work both scholarly and uproariously entertaining.” The Times Of London calls the film a “camp and messy reboot” in which “Jacob Elordi lacks menace”, but Games Radar gives it four out of five stars: “Masterfully concocted and pertinent in theme, Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein is a classy, if somewhat safe, adaptation with awards legs.” The trade adds: “In principle, del Toro has gone back to the book for his two-and-a-half-hour magnum opus, which cost more than Titanic and still looks like it was made for TV (as much as that pains me to say).” At Netflix's Tudum event earlier this year, Del Toro called the film “the culmination of a journey that has occupied most of my life,” adding, “Monsters have become my personal belief system. Coming off his third Oscar win for Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio, another literary adaptation for Netflix, Del Toro's Frankenstein also stars Mia Goth (X), Felix Kammerer (All Quiet on the Western Front), Lars Mikkelsen (The Witcher), David Bradley (Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio), Christian Convery (Sweet Tooth), Charles Dance (Game of Thrones) and Christoph Waltz (Inglourious Basterds).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Usually, getting in trouble with the Secret Service is no laughing matter. But 88-year-old Hollywood icon Dyan Cannon — a three-time Oscar nominee who co-starred in Hallmark's 2008 movie “A Kiss at Midnight” — couldn't stop laughing after agents denied her access to the White House over questions about her age. In an Instagram video that Cannon posted on August 28, 2025, she could be seen laughing as her dear friend, lifestyle expert Kym Douglas, described what happened. Douglas, who was a frequent contributor to Hallmark's former talk show “Home & Family,” posted her own video of the debacle, writing, “We almost got arrested in Washington due to one of us lying to Secret Service Agents.” The foursome co-hosts a new podcast called “God's Table.” With Cannon doubled over in laughter as they stood outside the White House gates, Douglas explained the situation in her video. “We're lined up for a great tour,” she said, and then panned her camera to show authorities standing nearby. We can't get in because someone lied about their age.” Cannon, still laughing, then confessed, “All right, girls, listen. After the women laughingly marveled at how Cannon managed to pull that off, she said, “Listen, it doesn't matter — keep lying about your age!” But Cannon has no regrets about trying to cover up her real age. She captioned her post, “And I'd do it again… it's nobody's business what the number is they've pinned on me ….right girls? it's just a blinkin number… no matter what number they put next to me there's one thing that never changes …I WUV WU‼️. Fans loved the funny video and Cannon's perspective on aging, flooding her post with comments. One of them wrote, “Dyan has laughed her whole life that's why she's so energetic and enthusiastic and positive!!! Married twice, including to Hollywood legend Cary Grant, Cannon told People in April she was seeing “several special (people)… I have friends with benefits, yes.”</p>

Guillermo del Toro is such a revered artist and an adored man that his status as a cheerleader of filmmaking craftspeople and hands-on artisans, his adulation for the art form itself, and his fight to keep it alive against the headwinds of artistry-crushing change might seem to overshadow the actual work. “Nightmare Alley” was a dreary mess, but who else could have nearly pulled off a remake of an obscure noir picture lost to time, retrofitted with style and glaze for the modern era? Who thought we needed another “Pinocchio” movie until del Toro turned the Italian fable into a stop-motion marvel, a film that prioritized actual human art-making over AI, CGI, and even that other I, IP, for its own sake? Related Stories ‘Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere' and ‘Ballad of a Small Player' Deliver Powerhouse Performances That Will Make Oscar Voters Take Notice ‘Late Fame' Review: Willem Dafoe Plays a Former Poet Who Falls in with a Young Crowd in Kent Jones' Perceptive Urban Drama Francis Ford Coppola's blood-soaked, bawdy, and shamelessly ludicrous “Bram Stoker's Dracula” his “Frankenstein” is not — though there are, like “Shape of Water,” plenty of smashed-in heads and dislocated jawbones in del Toro's Shelley adaptation. But he's opted for a gentler take on the monster classic, previously erected on Hollywood soundstages by the likes of James Whale and Kenneth Branagh. Within that mode, star Jacob Elordi plays the reanimated, sutured-from-refuse corpse known as Victor Frankenstein's monster in the most psychologically complex portrayal of the creature since Boris Karloff threw a little girl into a lake. Elordi moves with the physically searching quality of a marionette newly detached from its strings. As the creature, he comes to acquire a voice and autonomy and personhood that transcend any kind of nonverbal grunting often assigned to this character. Elordi, who has given consistently beautiful, sometimes flinty, ever uncategorizable and resistant-to-trend performances throughout his still-rising career, brings a quiet watchfulness to this Frankenstein's monster, and he becomes the soul of a movie that may not have had one without him. That's still to say that storytelling and performance become secondary and tertiary to del Toro's primary objective of spinning lavish, beautiful, hand-mounted movies bolted down to the Earth by the tactility of their creation. There are hints of the Freudian in his screenplay for this “Frankenstein,” as Victor's (Oscar Isaac) fetishization of his dead mother not only leads to his enterprising of bringing back to life dead soldiers, but also feeds the rather sudden flush of ardor he feels for Elizabeth Lavenza (Mia Goth), the fiancée of his younger, sprightlier, springier brother (Felix Kammerer). It's a little unsubtle, and whileyou don't buy his obsession with Elizabeth (which gets little screen time), it's suggestive of something weirder, kinkier, fleshier writhing beneath “Frankenstein's” relatively digestible, classically solid surface. (Speaking of museums, it's hard not to think about, watching “Frankenstein,” how everything onscreen, every stitch of fabric and pound of faux-flesh, won't end up in a traveling exhibit tie-in a la his “Pinocchio.”) What happens to a person who is made without love, and left still unloved after the fact? They become a monster, and del Toro, especially in a second chapter that tells the creature's story through his eyes, is willing to go deeper into his arc than most prior filmmakers. The movie begins with an under-wraps Elordi ripping into the crew of an ice-wrecked Russian ship, smashing bodies invincibly while trying to get his maker, Victor, back in his clutches after being left to die. The story then moves backwards as we see how Victor was tasked by his sister-in-law's uncle (Christoph Waltz) to create super soldiers for battle using the scrap body parts of dead ones. The Gothic Victorian Victor is installed in to carry out his mad genius will remind you of the decaying mansion in “Crimson Peak,” del Toro's twisted psychosexual ghost movie that brought to mind Robert Wise, Jack Clayton, and Val Lewton. That the majority of what you see in “Frankenstein” isn't AI- or computer-generated, del Toro's backdrops populated with living people behind and in front of the camera, is worth its own celebration. Waltz and Goth are fine, with Goth, who in earlier films possesses a mischievous, bubbly offbeatness similar to ‘70s Shelley Duvall but here just as well demonstrates her ability to shimmy into ethereal, period mode, seemingly falling for Frankenstein's monster at the drop of a wispy, gossamer veil. We're a little left on the branches as to how this encounter bloomed into a soul-shaking romance — as Elizabeth reveals, later, that she felt she never belonged to the decorous world of parties and corsets and curls and feathers on the head, a world that the monster could take her away from. Del Toro assumes some knowledge of the text so that we can tie these threads together ourselves, but the two romantic entanglements (Elizabeth and the monster, Elizabeth and Victor) don't get the fleshing-out and level of depth needed for us to accept them, fait accompli, oozing wounds and all. Still, Elordi does that lifting, with an alternately melancholic and disarmed take on the monster. The young Australian actor Elordi has brandished brutality and tenderness before, whether in “Euphoria” as a sexually conflicted, self-loathing jock or Justin Kurzel's “The Narrow Road to the Deep North” as a traumatized World War II soldier reeling from an extramarital affair. So there's no surprise that he nails it once again as this disconcerted monster, a creation and victim of humanity's hubris. The performance feels something close to otherworldly, an unsure alien dropped from nowhere, but with a movement coach on the back-end for extra litheness, limberness, and tentative undulation. “Frankenstein” does play it a little safe in its dedication to the well. It doesn't leave you with the feeling that anything was creatively risked (other than, of course, the monumental task of putting together a massive film set with real crew hand-making the thing from top to toe, cinematographer Dan Laustsen and production designer Tamara Deverell among them). Or that del Toro ever hit his head on some kind of artistic ceiling. But if you want a period monster movie that's solid, almost oaken in its sturdiness, you don't need to knock on wood to assure that del Toro is keeping the innermost essence, the soul of cinema, alive at least.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Just making a legal drama isn't enough, of course. What these networks are doing is crafting legal procedurals that manage to thread the needle between creating compelling case-of-the-week drama with a somewhat more lighthearted approach to its character-building. Prime Video hung its hook on another of Connelly's long-running characters, Los Angeles detective Harry Bosch, with its two separate Bosch shows, and NBC tried and recently failed to just make a straight-up Suits spin-off. That and the aforementioned Lincoln Lawyer redo were overseen by '80s-era legal-TV icon David E. ; at the moment, they have just one scripted TV series, and it premiered only two weeks ago. That show is a modernized adaptation of John Grisham's The Rainmaker, which has been performing its own balancing act between being a throwback to the laid-back USA procedurals of the mid-2000s and being darker and edgier like many other peak TV productions. The young hero is Rudy Baylor (Milo Callaghan), a hotshot young lawyer (in the mold of many of Grisham's protagonists) who has, along with his girlfriend Sarah (Madison Iseman), just started as a first-year associate at Tinley Britt, a well-to-do law firm with the tough-as-nails managing partner Leo Drummond (John Slattery). But he quickly gets back up on his feet and is hired by the fancy-sounding J. Lyman Stone and Associates, a firm run out of a defunct restaurant by Jocelyn Stone (Lana Parrilla) and her compatriot Deck Shifflet (P.J. They are, in short, ambulance chasers, but young Rudy has enough of a good heart that he's compelled to take on a wrongful death suit levied by Dot (Karen Bryson), whose addict son died in the care of a major hospital. Conveniently, that hospital's legal representation is Tinley Britt, which leads to inevitable face-offs in court between Rudy's old and new employers. The show, at least so far, is following the general outline of Grisham's novel, which means that there's an obvious way in which this series is unlike shows such as Suits or Burn Notice or Royal Pains. There's no case-of-the-week element but rather a single serialized case that will presumably encompass the entire season. You don't have to be familiar with Grisham's novel (or the 1997 film adaptation directed by Francis Ford Coppola and starring a pre-Good Will Hunting Matt Damon) to understand that Rudy is on the right side of justice in standing up for Dot and her dead son Donny Ray, who may have a checkered past but whose demise was clearly a lot more suspicious than initial report suggests. As played by Dan Fogler, Melvin is the first person we see, barely escaping a fire meant to destroy his small house that apparently kills his mother. In a different world, it would be easy to see Fogler playing Shifflet, a character as delightfully shady as his name suggests. But Melvin Pritcher, who coincidentally works as a nurse at the same hospital where Donny Ray died, is inexplicably much more than meets the eye. He seems like a friendly, unassuming, if slightly awkward fellow until (spoiler alert) the first episode climaxes with him mercilessly killing an older woman for having inadvertently spied on him in the middle of some shady deeds. Melvin is a microcosm of what this show wants: to present itself as a natural creative descendant of shows like Suits, whose relaxed tones are what lend them a certain charm, but then to shock its audience out of procedural complacency with twists that badly want to be as edgy as something on HBO or Showtime. But while Grisham's novels managed to become mammoth successes initially for capturing readers' imaginations in crafting a modern take on the legal thriller, there are so many other options from which audiences can choose on TV now that a 30-years-later take on The Rainmaker feels almost quaint, no matter how hard the writers try to gussy things up. It's not that the structural changes to the story (like Rudy working for Tinley Britt before he shifts to Stone and Associates, or Stone now being a female character) are bad or feel misguided. It's that those very changes, along with the inclusion of a character like Melvin Pritcher, seem like creative concessions to move beyond the so-called “blue sky” style of storytelling that USA succeeded with before. Netflix, aside from making old-school legal dramas, has co-opted the “blue sky” style, though largely by stepping beyond traditional criminal or law procedurals in favor of low-key and long-running romantic dramas like Virgin River. What the USA shows of old got right so quickly wasn't just the details of how criminal cases are settled in or out of the courtroom, or how ex-federal agents escape being burned; they correctly homed in on building likable characters who could be placed in any number of situations. The Rainmaker is boosted  far less by memorable characters and more by actors whose presences are welcome enough to almost make you forget they're elevating forgettable material. Through three episodes, it's the most well-known performers, like Slattery, Fogler, and Parrilla, who make the biggest impression simply for being more recognizable. Leo Drummond, for one, isn't terribly intriguing to watch as he schemes, but it's fun to see the former Roger Sterling dress down the next generation of actors. Their big, brassy performances are the most enjoyable aspect of the series, but it only proves that, on this show, actors, not characters, are welcome. In hindsight, and considering the second life that Suits got on Netflix, you can't help but wonder why the USA Network ever moved on from the “Characters Welcome” ethos, as many of its old series have had TV-movie extensions (like Psych) or sequels or just the possibility of sequels. (USA earlier this year announced it was developing a sequel series to Royal Pains.) The vast amount of new TV isn't any less staggering, but there would be a welcome appeal to USA going back to its previous roots.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere, depression causes the superstar musician to go deep into his writing and recording a new album in order to find his true self. It's a powerful argument all around about how the human experiences can transform into art and storytelling , and it is front and center in these films, with Hamnet perhaps being the most vivid example of them all. Based on Maggie O'Farrell's award winning novel, it is a fictional idea -albeit one steeped in research – that the death of Will Shakespeare's 11 year old son, Hamlet directly metamorphisized into a key theme in his play Hamlet . Although there is little solid evidence of it by those who study this kind of thing, the timing indicates the writing and production of the play coincided with this dark moment in Shakespeare's life and became a way to channel his grief into his writing. It tells the tale of Agnes (Jessie Buckley) , a free spirited lover of nature and wilderness with a wild child streak who basically is a bit of an outcast except by her farmer brother Bartholomew (Joe Alwyn), when one day Will Shakespeare (Paul Mescal) comes into her life and a passionate, somewhat forbidden affair commences, much to the objections of his stern parents, John (David Wilmot) and the very religious Mary (Emily Watson). Nevertheless they get married, have three kids, Susannah (Bohdi Rae Breathnatch), Judith (Olivia Lynes), and Hamnet (Jacobi Jupe). As the years pass Will finds himself frequently going away to London from their Stratford-On-Avon home in order to pursue his playwriting and producing dreams, while Agnes is left with the kids. Things really get tense when the plague intervenes and Judith gets gravely ill, an event where loving brother attempts to somehow transfer his own health to her to bring her back from the brink. This devastates the family, and no question absent father Will who is distraught when he arrives back to the house and finds his only son has died. Agnes lashes out at him for not being there when it counted, and the rift in their marriage has never been so clear. He throws himself back into his work, a new play Agnes had thought was a comedy but it turns out to be called “The Tragedy Of Hamlet” and it is anything but funny. The death of his son Hamlet ( a title card on the film explains the name Hamlet is another way of saying Hamlet) has directly affected the creation of this dark story with so much death at its center, and a ghostly presence that becomes its spiritual core. But can it bring Will and Agnes back to where they once were? What ensues becomes the film's undisputed highlight, a punch to the gut that will leave you shaken as well as in tears. Buckley, who can do no wrong, is sensational and the beating heart of the story as a young woman who ran free and marched to her own drummer, but who became a fiercely protective and devoted mother. Her life had been as much a marriage to nature as it was to Will, and the birth of their first child, Susannah, with Agnes alone in a deep hole outdoors is a memorable and stunning scene to say the least. Her fierce and unleashed emotional range is gut wrenching. Jupe is a sunny presence as Hamlet, so charming and fun we miss him all the more after his tragic death. In a nifty bit of casting Jacobi's older acting brother Noah Jupe, now all grown up, is terrific in the title role of the Hamlet production. After winning Oscars for Nomadland, and then trying a big-budget Marvel movie to show her versatility, Hamnet, with its quiet determination to say much about how art is affected by life, is unlike anything else and proof she is just about as good a filmmaker as any working today. Hamnet, with its two stars and director achieving new heights of their talents, knocked me out. Producers are Liza Marshall, Pippa Harris, Nicolas Gonda, Sam Mendes and Steven Spielberg.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lee Byung-hun, who starred in the Korean director's breakout hit ‘Joint Security Area' and more recently in ‘Squid Game,' plays a desperate man turned ruthless by unemployment. Think of No Other Choice (Eojjeol Suga Eopda) as something akin to Kind Hearts and Coronets that trades the Edwardian English aristocracy for the contemporary Korean industrial job market, and you'll have some idea of the tricky tonal balancing act it requires. Which makes it sad to report that Park Chan-wook stumbles on some jarring shifts. The movie remains the work of a master craftsman with his own idiosyncratic storytelling signature, though the pathos and suspense of a hardworking family man driven by desperation to murder get short-changed in favor of wacky humor. Notable among them are its gorgeous visual crispness, crazy camera angles and exhilarating zooms; its two appealing leads; its amusing jabs at capitalism; and an inventive ending that is both a victory over the cruelty of corporate redundancies and a sobering acknowledgement of the grim prospects for humans in an automated workforce. 'Below the Clouds' Review: Gianfranco Rosi's Stunning Doc Explores Life Beneath Mount Vesuvius, Today and in Ancient Times 'Frankenstein' Star Christoph Waltz on Guillermo del Toro's Practical Filmmaking: "CGI is For Losers" Starts and finishes in fine form but loses itself midway. It's key to Park's handle on the material that the character retains much of his innocence, even after getting blood on his hands. He's ideally cast here as Man-su, a paper mill manager with 25 years of company loyalty. Man-su gathers Miri, their teen son (Kim Woo-seung) and younger daughter (Choi so-yul) in a group hug under a sprinkling of cherry blossoms from the tree that spreads out above them while their two adorable golden retrievers — I mean seriously adorable — get in on the affection. In a cruel joke, he learns that the expensive eel on his barbecue sent by the mill's management is like a gold watch kiss-off, in this case marking involuntary retirement. He arrives at work and spreads the grim news among his team that the new American owners have indicated there will be job losses. Park mines poignancy and mordant humor from a support group for recently unemployed men, where they work on their emasculation issues and tell themselves in motivational exercises that their loving families will stand behind them while they seek new opportunities. She informs her husband that with foreclosure only three months away, it's their only way to pay off their debts and stay afloat. What most lights a fire under Man-su is the thought of losing the childhood home he worked hard to buy back, a sanctuary standing on land that was once his father's pig farm, where he loves to potter around in his greenhouse. He gets a tip about a position that would be perfect for him — aside from working under cocky former subordinate Choi Sun-chul (Park Hee-soon) — at Moon Paper, one of the few companies in the sector doing well, since they cracked the Japanese market. She concedes that her husband is not to blame for losing his job, but his weakness in dealing with it earns her contempt. The other obstacle to Man-su being first in line at Moon Paper is Go Sijo (Cha Seung-won), a gentle-natured shoe salesman whose heart remains in the paper industry. Park's cartoonish humor notwithstanding, there's tenderness toward these men, who were invested in their jobs to such a degree that being kicked to the curb leaves them nullified, stripped of their identities. Reeling them in proves easy for Man-su, with a fake company website and promotional video helping him to weed out the serious candidates. Icing them proves harder for the inept wannabe killer, landing him in embarrassing situations with precarious stakeout positions, muddy ground to slip on and a deadly snake bite that brings an unexpected rescuer. The film gets back on track, however, with an outcome arrived at via some unpredictable swerves and decisive intervention from Miri to fix Man-su's bungled efforts. Canadian actor-writer-director Don McKellar, likely a holdover from that earlier blueprint, is one of four credited screenwriters, which may also be a contributing factor to the herky-jerky tone. Whatever flaws there are in the execution, the fact remains that even a subpar Park Chan-wook film has more going for it than a lot of directors' best work.

Among the famous auteurs working today, there are a range of opinions on why one would want to make their film at Netflix, considering the lack of theatrical distribution that comes with working at the streaming service. But director Guillermo del Toro, who won an Oscar with Netflix for his take on “Pinocchio” offered a fresh angle on the matter during the press conference for “Frankenstein,” his latest Netflix film, premiering at the 82nd Venice Film Festival. Related Stories What's It Like to Hang Out with Paul Mescal, Jeremy Allen White, and Harris Dickinson at the Telluride Brunch? The Year Is 1979 and Nothing Will Stop You from Watching This Zombie Fight a Real Shark Del Toro has dreamed of making his own “Frankenstein” adaptation since he was a child, but “I always waited for the movie to be done in the right conditions both creatively and in terms of achieving the scope that it needed for me to make it different, to make it at a scale that you could reconstruct the whole world,” he said. Netflix was the studio that finally made that possible, with the film reportedly having a $120 million budget. “You never know what's gonna happen. When we released ‘Nightmare Alley,' we were released next to ‘Spider Man [No Way Home]' and Omicron, the variation of COVID, and we lasted very little, so you never know which format it's going to be,” said the director. At least with Netflix, “what I do know is to reach over 300 million viewers,” he said. “You take the opportunity and the challenge to make a movie that can transform itself variably, beautifully, and that evokes the cinema, and then you provide for theaters in the beginning and that makes for me a very creative experience.” “Frankenstein”will receive a limited theatrical release on October 17, 2025, and a global release by Netflix on November 7, 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On August 25, 2005, Donald Trump announced plans to build a 70-story high-rise in downtown New Orleans, which he referred to as a “sexy city.” Four days later, Hurricane Katrina hit. Trump and his family continued to pledge their commitment to the Trump Tower complex, saying they'd help the people of New Orleans rebuild their city, but the project never came to fruition. Twenty years later, the land it was supposed to stand on is still a parking lot. A Times-Picayune article in November 2005 was headlined: “Tower could power New Orleans revival.” “We have no doubt that the city of New Orleans will come back stronger than ever, and the Trump Organization is proud to be a part of this redevelopment process as New Orleans gets back on its feet. Years later, during a 2010 deposition about a different project, Trump said that immediately following Katrina, he actually offered the Florida developers their money back to get out of the project, but they turned him down. In January 2008, Donald Trump Jr. visited New Orleans to talk about the project and said the Trump Organization was planning a national push to look for buyers. Weeks later, they started advertising in the newspaper for employees. Prices for the condos would start at $400,000 and go up to $2 million. A website for the project featured an introductory video with Don Jr. and Ivanka wearing masquerade masks that dissolved off their faces as their signatures and “Live Luxury” and “Live Opulence” flashed across the screen. “As we struggle to rebuild and redefine our future, surely Mr. Trump's project can only be considered a win-win for all concerned,” wrote a woman named Gail. Now, They're Using TikTok to Tell Their Stories “Revenue from this economic development can help us rebuild levees and increase citizen protection in case of another hurricane,” said a man named Andrew. For years, a photograph of the proposed building was on a giant poster at the Poydras Street parking lot where it would supposedly be built. Five years later, when Trump was running for president against Hillary Clinton, the Democratic National Convention tried to use his failed attempt against him. A DNC researcher filed a public records request seeking documents about Trump and the scrapped project, but the city said none existed. “Across the country, he has outsourced instead of making American products, shortchanged small businesses and laid off workers. Over the decades of his work as a real estate mogul, Trump developed a less-than-sterling reputation for how he conducted business. He was often accused of fraud, which his political opponents have tried to use against him. One New Orleans citizen that wrote into the Times-Picayune celebrated Trump investing “a portion of his personal fortune into building Trump tower in New Orleans,” although, in fact, Trump was paid $2 million upfront to license his name. A similar failed tower and licensing deal happened in Tampa Bay and buyers were left distraught after sinking hundreds of thousands of dollars into something they believed to be managed by Trump himself. “The main reason we went into this was Trump,” said Jay McLaughlin, a physical therapist from Connecticut. But Trump would sometimes describe them as successes for his company since he got paid money upfront for the licensing deals. The White House and Donald Trump Jr. did not return Rolling Stone's requests for comment on the failed New Orleans project. President Trump did not publicly acknowledge the 20th anniversary of Katrina making landfall on Friday. After Hurricane Katrina decimated Louisiana, FEMA was overhauled and given more funding for disaster preparedness.
