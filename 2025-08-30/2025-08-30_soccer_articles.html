                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Enzo Maresca and his men earned bragging rights in a 2-0 win against Fulham on derby day. Tyrique George got minutes as a central forward while Joao Pedro played as a second striker. “The last game he played was against Manchester United at home last year and again we try to use a different solution. If you remember last year we used Pedro in some games as a nine. It is because we are always looking for solution but for sure when you have two proper nines, I think this is enough.” The revolving door in West London left Nicolas Jackson on the verge of joining Bayern Munich on a loan deal. It is not clear whether or not the Blues will try to bring him back to make up the numbers. When you have two strikers, it's enough. Today we play more than one hour with Tyrique and he did brilliant. With Levi Colwill suffering a long-term ACL injury and Cole Palmer pulling out of the warm-up before their win over West Ham last week, the effects of the Club World Cup are being felt. “Unfortunately I don't have any answer because it's the first time you have a competition during the summer so I don't know. I think it's not random that Levi, Cole, Liam today. One is a teenager who adds to the list of first team squad members from Cobham, and he has potential to refine in the men's game. “Josh Acheampong was very good against Crystal Palace. Four other men, two of whom are back from injury, can contribute to the depth chart in the position. “Tosin Adarabioyo is doing fantastic from last season, Trevoh Chalobah is exactly the same ever since he came back in January and we have Wesley Fofana back that is another one that can help us after the international break probably we can have also Benoit Badiashile.” Chelsea have not been convincing in the last fortnight. They drew 0-0 with Crystal Palace in front of their fans, getting lucky with a disallowed free kick for Eberechi Eze, and thrashed a hapless West Ham 5-1. Neither did they dominate in this duel, but they are unbeaten and went top of the table. “I'm very happy first of all as you said because three games, seven points. “I think the one that win the Premier League the year before they are always the one that u they are the favourite and then again Arsenal is there, Man City is there, Tottenham will be also there and you have always some team that they can be a surprise like last year for example Nottingham Forest.” The Cottagers drew 1-1 in their first two fixtures and avoided defeat at home to Man United for the first time in 15 years last week. Thankfully, the second half had much more of what the manager wanted to see from his squad. I was not happy after the first half. Second half I think we were very good on the ball and we were very good in second ball and duels and I think we deserve to win the game. Enzo Fernandez appeared to be frustrated as he walked in at half time. But the captain claimed a goal from the penalty spot and an assist through a corner kick for Joao Pedro, putting his rage behind him. The penalty also came through a VAR review as Ryan Sessegnon handled the ball in his box. Both calls were harsh for the guests, who should have gotten more, but Maresca did not share sympathies. From my point of view, it's quite clear that the first one, one of their players kick our players and the second one is quite clear that it's handball. Now I can understand that from their point of view can be no foul but I think it's quite clear that it's foul and then it's penalty.”</p>

Endrick, however, is the one with more to prove as he nears a recovery from his injury. Unfortunately, however, he suffered a relapse just before his return to action and was ruled out until mid-September in which came as a massive blow to him. Now, as relayed by MARCA, Endrick is in the final stages of his recovery and has begun working on the grass and is even moving around without discomfort. It is the young phenom's plan to first earn a place in Alonso's rotation, stake claim on a place in the starting XI and eventually be important for the club, and he is working towards his goals in silence and with discipline. However, he never considered a departure in any capacity as it was his single objective to stay and fight at the club. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment. While it was always expected that Carvajal will give stern competition to Trent, it is perhaps a bit concerning that the Englishman is already fall in comparison to the veteran's performances. However, the Spaniard is not getting younger and given Trent's predicament, Alonso must soon choose a definitive favourite at right-back.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since signing on to become the head coach of the United States men's national team last September, Mauricio Pochettino has had to get up to speed on American sports culture — on Saturday, he got a crash course. Pochettino, a native of Argentina, made his "Big Noon Kickoff" debut on Saturday morning ahead of Ohio State-Texas, which is as big as a rivalry can get in college football, and arguably all of American sports. "I'm so excited to be here," Pochettino said. Pochettino is hopeful that the environment of a fierce college football rivalry can be replicated when the U.S. men's national team plays their first match of the 2026 FIFA World Cup on home soil 286 days from now. "The most important thing is to arrive in very good condition and be competitive, and that these guys feel proud about the team like they are today," Pochettino said of next year's 48-team tournament. It's going to be an unbelievable event, and it's going to be key to the future of soccer in the USA. The only thing we want is for the fans to enjoy our game like they're enjoying today." For his sake, let's hope that Longhorn fans don't take that as him choosing a side in this rivalry. Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Football is a sport of drama, skill, and moments that live forever. Among them, nothing excites fans more than an immediate strike right after kick-off. These lightning-fast goals stand as unforgettable examples of how quickly fortunes can change in football. This article highlights the Top 10 Fastest Goals in World Cup History under 60 seconds. Florian Albert scored one of the Fastest Goals in World Cup History when he netted just 50 seconds into Hungary's clash with Bulgaria at the 1962 FIFA World Cup. Known as one of Hungary's most talented strikers, Albert's instinctive positioning allowed him to find space inside the box almost immediately after kick-off. The Hungarian team launched a quick attack, and Albert was there to finish decisively, putting his side ahead before the Bulgarian defense could even settle. His quick strike remains a shining memory of Hungary's World Cup history, especially during an era when they were recognized for producing technically gifted footballers. Even though Hungary didn't go all the way in the tournament, this moment still stands among the fastest goals in World Cup history, preserved in FIFA records as a standout highlight. Adalbert Desu entered football history books at the inaugural 1930 World Cup in Uruguay. In Romania's opening match against Peru, Desu scored just 50 seconds after the first whistle. This strike made him one of the first players to achieve one of the Fastest Goals in World Cup History. At a time when global football was still finding its rhythm, this goal demonstrated how individual brilliance could shape early tournaments. Romania surprised many by fielding a team with strong attacking instincts, and Desu's lightning-quick goal was a symbol of their fearless style of play. His quick reaction to capitalize on Peru's defensive lapse highlighted the unpredictable nature of football, where preparation can be undone in seconds. This iconic moment is now remembered among the fastest goals in World Cup history, serving as a reminder that even nearly a century later, football's timeless magic often comes in the form of quickfire strikes that catch both defenders and fans completely off guard. In 1938, Sweden produced one of their most memorable World Cup performances, thanks to Arne Nyberg's early strike against Cuba. Scoring within 35 seconds, Nyberg's goal still stands among the Fastest Goals in World Cup History. The Swedish forward demonstrated quick reflexes and anticipation as his team pressed Cuba straight from kick-off. Nyberg's quick strike was not only crucial in the context of that match but also showcased Sweden's tactical discipline in pressing high and attacking early. The World Cup in 1938 was played under challenging circumstances due to global tensions, yet moments like Nyberg's goal provided thrilling entertainment. Fans remember this match as a demonstration of Swedish efficiency, and Nyberg's name has been immortalized for his ability to deliver under pressure. His lightning goal still resonates with football historians and is often highlighted among the fastest goals in World Cup history, proving that early aggression can set the tone in knockout tournaments. The same World Cup in 1938 produced another record-breaking strike, this time from French forward Emile Veinante. His ability to find space immediately after kick-off showed both his sharp instincts and the tactical intent of France to dominate their rivals quickly. Belgium were left stunned, unable to recover from the early blow. Veinante's name has remained part of France's World Cup folklore, with his strike celebrated for decades as one of the Fastest Goals in World Cup History. The fact that both he and Sweden's Arne Nyberg scored within 35 seconds in the same tournament adds an extraordinary chapter to football history. Veinante's strike not only showcased individual brilliance but also highlighted the value of momentum, proving how crucial the first minute can be in World Cup battles. Bernard Lacombe earned his spot in the records with a goal against Italy at the 1978 FIFA World Cup in Argentina. Scoring just 31 seconds into the match, Lacombe delivered one of the Fastest Goals in World Cup History and gave France an unforgettable start. The 1978 World Cup was known for its fierce competition, but Lacombe's strike remains etched in memory because of its timing and precision. To score against Italy, a team renowned for defensive resilience, made the goal even more significant. Lacombe's strike showed that even defensive giants could be caught off guard in seconds. For French football, this goal symbolized hope and attacking intent, despite their ultimate elimination. Clint Dempsey delivered one of the most famous moments in American football history when he scored after just 30 seconds against Ghana at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. They had faced Ghana in previous World Cups and suffered painful defeats, but Dempsey's strike set the tone for revenge. The early goal boosted confidence and showcased America's growing football presence. It remains one of the most replayed goals in US football history and underlined Dempsey's reputation as a leader and clutch performer. Even though the match was tense and ended in drama, Dempsey's lightning strike became a historic symbol of belief and determination. Bryan Robson holds a special place in England's football history thanks to his rapid strike against France in the 1982 World Cup. Scoring in just 28 seconds, Robson etched his name among the Fastest Goals in World Cup History and gave England the perfect start to their campaign. His goal came after England pressed aggressively from the opening whistle. Germany's Ernest Lehner produced one of the earliest examples of rapid football brilliance when he scored in just 25 seconds against Austria at the 1934 World Cup. His strike ranks as one of the Fastest Goals in World Cup History and showed how quickly momentum could be seized, even in the sport's early years. Germany attacked immediately after kick-off, and Lehner's positioning allowed him to finish clinically. Lehner's strike symbolized Germany's tactical discipline and readiness to capitalize on any opportunity. Scoring so quickly in a knockout World Cup match highlighted the high stakes and tension of international football. His goal also served as a reminder of Germany's growing reputation in world football during the 1930s. Though the tournament eventually ended with Italy as champions, Lehner's lightning strike remains celebrated as one of the Fastest Goals in World Cup History, cementing his place in football's record books Vaclav Masek stunned the footballing world when he scored after only 15 seconds for Czechoslovakia against Mexico in the 1962 World Cup. Masek's goal carried huge significance and is remembered as one of the Fastest Goals in World Cup History. It represented the attacking spirit of Czechoslovakia during an era when they were considered one of Europe's rising football powers. It highlighted how early determination and sharp execution could create lasting memories. For fans and players alike, Masek's goal is a reminder that games can be decided in moments, and history can be written in less than a quarter of a minute, solidifying its place among the Fastest Goals in World Cup History. The goal shocked fans and set the tone for an entertaining game, which ended in a thrilling 3-2 victory for Turkey. Turkey had enjoyed a remarkable run in the 2002 tournament, and this goal was the perfect climax to their fairy-tale campaign. His strike, now recognized among the Fastest Goals in World Cup History, has stood the test of time for more than two decades and continues to inspire players worldwide. Telling the stories behind football and cricket through expert reporting. England manager Thomas Tuchel has made headlines after leaving Real Madrid full-back Trent Alexander-Arnold out of his latest England squad for the September World Cup qualifiers. Inter Miami's Argentine superstar Lionel Messi returned to action after a brief absence due to injury, but even then, he seemed a bit uncomfortable on the pitch. The injury had forced him to miss two important matches, leaving fans and the team eager to see him back in form. Messi delivered a stellar performance, scoring two crucial goals—including a controversial penalty—that ultimately secured Inter Miami's spot in the final of the prestigious tournament. This year's edition, the 17th season of the Asia Cup, promises to be bigger, more competitive, and more entertaining than ever before.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MIAMI BEACH, FLA. (WSVN) - Newly released body camera video shows officers arresting a man who, police said, brutally beat a German sports journalist who was visiting South Florida earlier this summer — and the suspect is no stranger to the law. The bodycam video, obtained exclusively by 7News, captured the moment Miami Beach Police officers took Perry Smith into custody. Listen to me!” an officer tells Smith. Never before seen crime scene photos, also obtained by 7News, capture the extent of the injuries that Pit Gottschalk suffered back on June 27: a swollen, bloody eye, a bruised face and more bruising on his back. Gottschalk said he was randomly attacked while on the Beachwalk near 27th Street. The journalist had flown in from Germany to cover FIFA Club World Cup matches being held at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens. But as he was walking back to his hotel that night, the victim found himself in the middle of a bare-knuckle fight of which he wanted no part. “What's your first name?” an officer says in the bodycam video. Investigators and city officials said the suspect in the random attack is a familiar face. Smith is well known to Miami Beach officers and victims of violent crime. “He started saying, ‘You [expletive], you [expletive],' threw me on the floor,” said a victim in a prior incident. “[He said], ‘Give me all your money now, or I'm going to hurt you,'” said Jo Manning, a victim in yet another incident. City Commissioner Alex Fernandez did not mince worlds about Smith. “This is a menace to society,” he said. “He's attacking innocent people walking down the street,” said Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Mindy S. Glazer during an April 30, 2024 bond hearing. A repeat felony offender, Smith has been in and out of jail, from Miami-Dade to Georgia, for attacks on women and men. Last year, he received what city leaders and victims called a “sweetheart” plea deal after an attempted strong-arm robbery on Manning, who is in her 80s. Smith is also a convicted sex offender. He now sits in the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center following his alleged encounter with Gottschalk, who had a “welcome to South Florida” moment he won't soon forget. During his bond hearing on June 29, Smith didn't exactly make friends with Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Christine Hernandez. “And you're going to die a thousand deaths,” said Smith.. Smith faces a list of charges that include battery, resisting arrest and trespassing. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

"It's a way to connect travelers, not only for the sporting events, but also for them to come back in future years and experience our city," said San Jose Mineta International Airport Director of Aviation Mookie Patel.

San Jose leaders hope the work they're putting in will make it so the rest of their time is spent right here.</p>
