                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study from Spain reveals that babies born to mothers exposed to higher air pollution levels in pregnancy show signs of slower brain myelination, a subtle but telling shift in how early brain wiring unfolds. Study: Unraveling the impact of prenatal air pollution for neonatal brain maturation. A recent study published in Environment International suggests that prenatal exposure to air pollution is linked to delayed maturation in the newborn, likely associated with a slowing of the rate of myelination. The developing brain is highly vulnerable to injury by environmental factors, including air pollution. This can cause neuropsychiatric disorders, which are among the significant causes of disability worldwide. Particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 µm or less (PM2.5) is often used as a pollution indicator because it originates in so many different sources of pollution and contains a spectrum of pollutants, including potentially toxic elements and essential trace metals such as iron, copper, and zinc. Conversely, it exposes the fetus to essential micronutrients like copper, iron, and zinc, all of which promote gestational white matter myelination. For instance, offspring of women exposed to particulate matter of the PM10 variety had larger brain ventricles and cerebelli. The opposite was true of NO2 exposure, though both are pollutants. Opposite effects have been reported with other brain areas. Myelination is an important marker of brain maturation. The myelin sheath speeds up nerve conduction and shapes brain circuitry. Air pollution exposure before birth causes changes in the brain's white matter, including its myelin content and structure. This led to the current study, which examined PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy as a predictor of newborn brain myelination. The study sample comprised 93 newborns born at three hospitals in Barcelona, Spain, between 2018 and 2021. Their prenatal PM2.5 exposure was modeled, separately for the embryonic and late fetal phases. The newborn brain was imaged by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 29 days of postnatal life. However, this association was not found for cortical myelination. Increasing prenatal PM2.5 exposure in early pregnancy was associated with a lower cortical myelinated white matter content. In late pregnancy, it was linked to lower overall myelination. This suggests that the brain cortex and deep white matter may respond differently to chemical pollution in early developmental stages. This pattern was also observed with trace element exposure, though the associations weakened or disappeared when adjusted for confounding factors. The findings suggest a delay in early myelination following exposure to air pollution in the prenatal period. However, since myelination is a dynamic process whose rate varies with age, brain region, and the availability of nutrition, this observation does not necessarily indicate a harmful or permanent effect on the fetus. In fact, one prior study indicates that slower but more sustained white matter myelination is found in children with higher cognitive skills. Again, the placenta may protect the fetus from certain pollutants, which simultaneously allows essential elements to pass through. Women exposed to air pollution in pregnancy had babies with lower white matter myelination in the newborn period. Reduced cortical myelination was specifically associated with higher PM2.5 exposure in early pregnancy, but global myelination declined with later exposure. These findings suggest a potential delay in neonatal brain maturation. Significant associations were not found for iron, copper, or zinc in PM2.5, though the observed trends were in the same direction. This study underscores the impact of environmental factors on neonatal brain development and the importance of stringent air quality policies. The cognitive outcome of delayed neonatal white matter myelination remains unknown. Thus, the study also underlines the importance of longitudinal research to understand how prenatal air pollution affects long-term behavior and intellectual development.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This shows that more daily movement could mean higher overnight blood sugar, challenging assumptions about exercise and glucose control. Study: Daytime physical activity and nighttime glucose levels in individuals with pregnancy hyperglycemia: linking wearable activity trackers to continuous glucose monitoring. A recent feasibility study, published in Frontiers in Endocrinology, explores how blood glucose levels during the night (midnight to 6 AM) vary with the level of daytime physical activity or sedentary behavior, in women with pregnancy hyperglycemia. In most patients with high blood glucose levels, the therapeutic goal is to achieve good control of daytime glucose levels. Nocturnal hyperglycemia, typically defined as elevated glucose between 12-6 AM, has been linked to LGA births and the need for pharmacologic treatment during pregnancy. Increased fasting glucose concentrations are linked to LGA babies and to the future risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The practical difficulties of tracking nocturnal glycemia are largely overcome by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). CGM is unique in its ability to evaluate 24-hour blood glucose variations. The development of wearable tracking sensors that monitor 24-hour movement patterns is an advance that, combined with CGM, offers “a powerful, scalable means to assess the dynamic interplay between health behaviors and glucose regulation.” The current study was a secondary analyses of a feasibility trial on the combined use of CGM and continuous movement devices in this patient population. The scientists performed a secondary analysis of the data from both types of devices, seeking to identify associations between them. The study included 13 patients at about 31 weeks of pregnancy. They were monitored for a week with the Dexcom G6 CGM and the ActiGraph Insight Watch (a continuous movement device). The former records interstitial glucose levels every five minutes. In this study, the nighttime values collected by CGM were included. In this cohort, the median for mean nighttime glucose levels was 91, while glucose values remained in range 85% of the time. Thus, the percentage of time in range (%TIR; 60–99 mg/dL) was 85%. Values falling outside the range were mostly those that were above 99 mg/dL, with <1% of test values being below range. After adjusting for gestational age and device wear time, the researchers found that the mean glucose concentration increased by 0.86 mg/dL with each ten-minute addition to total MVPA. Similar trends were absent with LPA or sedentary behavior. These findings contradict current evidence from daytime readings, where increased physical activity reduces blood glucose levels in individuals with hyperglycemia. This requires further research into the altered interaction of hormonal and physiological changes in pregnancy with activity patterns, especially as sedentary behavior or light physical activity did not predict nighttime glucose levels. One possible reason for this unexpected finding is that people who move more vigorously during the daytime may eat more afterwards, especially carbohydrates. This hypothesis could not be tested due to the lack of accurate dietary data. Future studies should use objective dietary assessments to identify how this affects the interaction between physical activity and blood glucose control. Another possibility is that the participants had disturbed sleep, which adversely affects blood glucose regulation. Either way, it is important to validate and address this pattern because high nighttime glucose levels increase LGA risk, and are more likely to predict severe hyperglycemia and future diabetes risk This is the first study to combine CGM and activity sensors to explore associations between nighttime blood glucose levels (rather than daytime glucose monitoring) and daytime behavioral patterns. The study demonstrates the feasibility of combining these technologies to provide data that could guide tailored adaptive feedback systems. Improvements in glucose and activity monitoring technology hold great promise for improving scientific and clinical understanding and supporting the development of personalized, data-driven glucose management tools during pregnancy. Future research should include a larger sample size, besides continuous dietary and sleep assessments, coupled with CGM and behavioral monitoring. The authors suggest that using phone cameras to record meal and self-reported data, could capture 24-hour lifestyle patterns more effectively. This would shed light on the complex interrelationships of sleep, dietary factors, biological rhythms, and glucose regulation in pregnancy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Where you live could shape how your brain ages, with neighborhood inequality and environmental stressors leaving measurable biological traces linked to Alzheimer's disease. A new study published in the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia: Behavior & Socioeconomics of Aging reveals that individuals living in neighborhoods with higher levels of social vulnerability, environmental injustice, and socioeconomic disadvantage are associated with biological patterns linked to Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Place-based social determinants of health are nonmedical factors within a person's physical environment and community. These elements play a vital role in shaping an individual's health, functioning, and quality of life. The basic social determinants of health include socioeconomic status, healthcare access, education access, healthy food availability, housing quality, violence, racism, discrimination, social support networks, and many more. Addressing these factors can improve health, reduce inequalities, and promote quality of life. Existing evidence has linked these factors to cardiometabolic health and cognition. An association between the Area Deprivation Index (ADI) and cortical thickening in Alzheimer's disease-specific brain regions has also been observed in individuals with unpaired cognitive functioning. ADI, a composite measure of social determinants of health, is used to measure socioeconomic disadvantages at the neighborhood level to identify communities with higher risk of adverse health outcomes. Despite potential involvement of place-based social determinants of health in determining cognitive health, it remains largely unknown whether these factors influence vital biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. In the current study, researchers from the Wake Forest University School of Medicine aimed to investigate the associations of three composite measures of place-based social determinants of health, including ADI, the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), and the Environmental Justice Index (EJI), with neuroimaging and plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias in more than 600 Black and White participants aged 54 years or above. The study reported that the scores of all three social determinants of health indices were higher among Black participants compared to those among White participants. This finding indicates that Black participants live in regions with higher levels of neighborhood disadvantage, social vulnerability, and environmental injustice. The analysis of the association between these indices and Alzheimer's disease and dementia biomarkers revealed that among Black participants, higher SVI and EJI scores are associated with higher variability in cerebral blood flow in the brain gray matter; higher ADI scores are associated with lower cerebral blood flow in the gray matter, and higher ADI and SVI scores are associated with lower cortical thickness. Among White participants, the analysis revealed a modest negative association between SVI scores and glial fibrillary acidic protein, a plasma biomarker of Alzheimer's disease and dementia. The study findings suggest that place-based social determinants of health are moderately associated with less favorable Alzheimer's disease and dementia biomarkers among Blacks or African Americans, but not among Whites. Similar negative associations have been observed between social vulnerability and environmental injustice and cortical thickness among participants with mild cognitive impairments. However, these associations were absent among participants without cognitive impairment. The observed associations between place-based social determinants of health and neuroimaging biomarkers only among Black participants indicate that place-based distribution of resources and opportunities may differentially impact biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and dementia based on racialized identities and experiences. The study used three indices that capture a broad range of place-based social determinants of health, including social characteristics related to income, education, and housing, household characteristics, transportation, racial and ethnic minority status, and environmental characteristics (pollution, toxic waste disposal sites, and chronic disease burden). These determinants may partially capture the effects of structural racism, indicating that the observed associations may partially be influenced by structural racism. The study findings suggest that social vulnerability may be associated with brain health and that this measure could help identify neighborhoods where monitoring social determinants of health may have a significant impact. However, only some of the observed associations remained statistically significant after correction for multiple comparisons, and further replication is needed before drawing firm conclusions. Overall, the study findings highlight the need for further research to examine the impact of structural racism on biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and dementia in more racially, ethnically, socioeconomically, and geographically diverse cohorts. Similarly, it remains uncertain whether early-life and mid-life exposure to these determinants affects later-life levels of Alzheimer's disease and dementia biomarkers. Future studies with longitudinal life-course residential data are needed to address these limitations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Although yogurt is often praised for its nutrient profile, this review reveals that its real-world impact on adult bone strength remains minimal, highlighting the need for rigorous trials using well-defined yogurt formulations. Review: Impact of yogurt consumption on bone health markers in adults with or without osteoporosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Yogurt is a coagulated dairy product obtained from milk fermentation by the symbiotic action of Lactobacillus delbrueckii bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Despite highly similar biochemical compositions of yogurt and milk, the former offers unique nutritional benefits due to the metabolic activity of these bacteria, which can synthesize vitamins and other biologically active compounds. Yogurt is a good source of protein, potassium, calcium, vitamins, zinc, and selenium, many of which are known to augment bone health and growth. The higher levels of vitamins K and B and enhanced mineral ionization in yogurt compared to milk have led to suggestions that yogurt may help improve and sustain bone health. However, current evidence on the effects of yogurt intake on bone health is inconsistent, with neutral and positive associations reported across studies. Moreover, there are limited systematic reviews on yogurt intake and bone health. First, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Scopus databases were searched for relevant studies published between 1970 and 2023, with an updated PubMed search conducted through December 31, 2024. Eligible studies included adults without or with osteoporosis and examined yogurt intake compared to placebo, non-fermented dairy counterparts, no yogurt intake, or standard osteoporosis treatments. Observational studies, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and non-randomized interventions were eligible. The team extracted data on study characteristics, yogurt intake and dosage, population demographics, intervention duration, and exposure. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was adopted to examine the certainty of evidence. Further, the team performed a random-effects meta-analysis when measurements were adequately homogeneous. Two separate meta-analyses were conducted; one included studies reporting hazard ratios, and the other pooled continuous femoral bone mineral density (BMD) using standardized mean difference, as no eligible interventional trials were ultimately identified. Literature search identified 1,302 records, of which only 12 met the eligibility criteria for inclusion, corresponding to 14 studies. Most studies were conducted in the United States (US), followed by Europe and Asia. However, US studies included populations from only two independent cohorts: the Nurses' Health Study and Framingham Original Cohort and its derivative cohorts. Two studies reported that yogurt intake was significantly associated with improved BMD, bone-related biomarkers, and osteoporosis risk. Specifically, one study found a protective effect on radius osteoporosis risk in high-frequency consumers of yogurt compared to non-consumers, and another study found higher femoral neck and total hip BMD in females with the highest intakes of yogurt compared to those with the lowest intakes. Further, one additional study indicated a weak association between yogurt consumption and protective effects on hip fractures. In meta-analyses, no significant associations were observed between yogurt intake and hip fracture risk at reported consumption levels. However, yogurt intake had a significantly positive effect on femoral BMD, albeit its magnitude was clinically negligible (SMD ≈ 0.009), indicating minimal impact on skeletal health. The methodological quality of included evidence was considered satisfactory to support meta-analysis conclusions, but the certainty of evidence for BMD and hip fracture risk was low, largely due to reliance on observational data, hazard ratios close to unity, and the absence of dose-response relationships. Importantly, none of the included studies characterized yogurt products in terms of fat content, fortification, or viable bacterial cultures, limiting mechanistic interpretation. While most studies indicated a positive trend of yogurt intake on bone health, the evidence was insufficient to support that yogurt intake helps in BMD improvements or fracture prevention in adults. High-quality RCTs are required to clarify the effects of yogurt intake, especially in those with or at risk for osteopenia or osteoporosis. Future research must incorporate standardized, well-characterized yogurt products to determine whether live cultures or formulation differences contribute to any potential benefits. Overall, the efficacy of yogurt as a strategy to enhance bone health is not fully substantiated by current evidence. Tarun is a writer based in Hyderabad, India.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A major review shows that what we eat may significantly influence pelvic floor outcomes, offering new hope for improving sexual function and incontinence through dietary intervention rather than solely physical therapy or medication. Review findings revealed that healthy, anti-inflammatory dietary patterns, particularly the Mediterranean diet, are significantly associated with improved sexual function and reduced incontinence symptoms, while pro-inflammatory diets were linked to increased PFD risk. Pelvic floor dysfunction (PFD) is an umbrella term for a complex set of conditions (e.g., sexual dysfunction and incontinence) and is an anatomical condition characterized by weak, damaged, or uncoordinated muscles in the pelvic floor, leading to urinary or fecal incontinence, pelvic pain, constipation, and pelvic organ prolapse. PFD is an unexpectedly globally prevalent condition often hidden by social stigma. Its symptoms, including urinary or fecal incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, and sexual dysfunction, such as erectile dysfunction in men or orgasmic dysfunction in women, can significantly impair patients' QoL, often requiring clinical interventions to improve outcomes and restore functional normalcy. While lifestyle modifications are often leveraged as the first-line treatment in addressing PFD diagnoses, the conversation surrounding these interventions has historically been dominated by physical therapies (e.g., Kegel exercises). However, a growing body of literature suggests that diet may play a pivotal role, given its link to chronic inflammation and metabolic health. Notably, anti-inflammatory diets have previously been linked to better sexual function, while high salt intake is known to worsen overactive bladder symptoms. Unfortunately, despite these hypotheses, clinical investigations of the topic remain fragmentary, often focusing on single nutrients rather than the synergistic effects of whole dietary patterns. Consequently, a large-scale, systematic synthesis is needed to understand the true impact of diet on PFD. The present systematic review and meta-analysis aim to address this knowledge gap and inform future PFD interventions by synthesizing all high-quality existing evidence on the topic. The review adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a gold standard for such reviews. The review comprised a thorough, custom search-directed scrutiny of several public scientific repositories (e.g., PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase) for studies published up to August 2024 (total identified = 493). Notably, 14 studies (eight cross-sectional studies, three prospective studies, and three randomized controlled trials [RCTs]) provided sufficient quantitative data to be pooled into a new meta-analysis, allowing for the statistical calculation of the overall effect of these diets on sexual function and incontinence symptoms. Overall, healthy dietary patterns were associated with significant improvements in both sexual dysfunction and incontinence symptoms. When independently analyzing sexual dysfunction, both the Mediterranean diet and general anti-inflammatory diets were significantly associated with a reduced risk. Data from prospective studies reinforced these findings, demonstrating a significant improvement in sexual function scores (Standardized Mean Difference, SMD = -0.60). However, high statistical heterogeneity was observed among prospective studies (I² = 87%), prompting a sensitivity analysis. When two Esposito trials were excluded, the effect remained positive but more modest (SMD = -0.25), indicating greater consistency. Benefits were most pronounced in individuals with metabolic syndrome, suggesting that endothelial and inflammatory mechanisms may play a key role. When analyzing incontinence data, results were more nuanced. Pro-inflammatory diets (high Dietary Inflammatory Index scores) were strongly associated with increased urinary and fecal incontinence risk. The DASH diet was also shown to be effective in alleviating lower urinary tract symptoms, an observation attributed to the diet's low salt content. However, in prospective analyses, the overall effect on incontinence was not statistically significant (SMD = -0.17), suggesting that improvements may be mediated through weight loss and reductions in intra-abdominal pressure rather than direct inflammatory pathways. The findings strongly support integrating dietary counseling into clinical practice for PFD, particularly for patients who also have metabolic risk factors like obesity or type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the authors emphasize that most included studies were observational, limiting causal inference, and residual confounding, especially from BMI, cannot be excluded. While the observational nature of many included studies and variations in their design limit the causation and generalizability of the review, it provides a strong scientific basis for recommending diet as a non-pharmacological strategy to improve pelvic floor health.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While often promoted for health benefits, low-calorie diets may carry hidden inflammatory risks, as genetic evidence reveals a subtle link to psoriatic arthritis unseen in vegetarian and gluten-free patterns. Study: Causal Relationships Between Popular Diets (Low-Calorie, Vegetarian, and Gluten-Free Diets) and Inflammatory Skin Diseases: A Mendelian Randomization Study. Their findings indicate that low-calorie diets could increase the risk of developing psoriatic arthritis, with a modest effect size (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01–1.10, p=0.008). While gluten-free and vegetarian diets were not linked to any of the studied inflammatory skin diseases, further research is needed to confirm these findings. Inflammatory skin diseases like acne, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and atopic dermatitis (AD) are chronic conditions involving immune dysregulation and inflammation, impacting patients' quality of life and mental health. Popular dietary patterns like low-calorie, vegetarian, and gluten-free diets have gained attention due to perceived health benefits and growing media promotion. However, poorly balanced diets can cause nutritional deficiencies that negatively affect skin health. Previous clinical studies exploring diet–skin disease links have produced inconsistent results due to confounding factors and methodological limitations. Mendelian randomization (MR), which uses genetic variants as proxies for exposures, offers a more reliable approach to assessing causal relationships while minimizing bias and reverse causation. Researchers followed established reporting guidelines and used an MR design based on three core assumptions: genetic variants must be associated with the exposure (diet type), independent of confounders, and affect the outcome (skin disease) only through that exposure. Genetic data for the diets were obtained from the UK Biobank (64,949 participants), while disease data were sourced from large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) including up to 462,933 samples. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with each diet were selected as instrumental variables, with only SNPs showing F-statistics above 10 included to ensure strength and validity. Due to limited genome-wide significant variants, a relaxed significance threshold (p<5×10⁻⁵) with linkage disequilibrium clumping was applied, and MR-PRESSO was additionally used to conduct a global test for pleiotropy and identify potential outlier SNPs. The MR analysis using the IVW method found that a low-calorie diet had a statistically significant association with an increased risk of developing PsA (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01–1.10, p=0.008). In contrast, vegetarian and gluten-free diets were not linked to a higher or lower risk of PsA. No significant causal relationships were found between any of the three diets and the other inflammatory skin diseases (psoriasis, acne, or AD). Although heterogeneity was observed in the vegetarian diet–psoriasis analysis, a multiplicative random-effects IVW model was applied and confirmed no significant association. Sensitivity analyses, including MR-Egger regression, leave-one-out analysis, and funnel plots, indicated no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy or major bias. The authors emphasized that the observed association was small, and that limited statistical power and potential measurement limitations in dietary phenotypes may have reduced the ability to detect subtle effects. This study is the first to use MR to explore causal relationships between popular dietary patterns and inflammatory skin diseases. The findings indicate that a low-calorie diet may slightly increase the risk of psoriatic arthritis, while vegetarian and gluten-free diets show no significant effects on psoriasis, acne, or atopic dermatitis. The authors suggest that prolonged calorie restriction might trigger nutrient deficiencies affecting immune balance and inflammation, possibly explaining the elevated PsA risk. This finding contrasts with common expectations that calorie restriction is uniformly anti-inflammatory, highlighting the complexity of dietary effects. Key strengths include a genetically informed design that minimizes confounding and reverse causation. However, limitations such as lenient SNP selection thresholds, low statistical power, self-reported dietary data, potential sample overlap, absence of multiple-testing correction, and limited ethnic diversity restrict the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the small effect sizes and lack of multivariable adjustments mean results should be viewed as preliminary. Future studies with larger, more diverse samples, better-defined dietary measures, and multivariable or mediation analyses are needed to confirm causal pathways. In conclusion, while the study suggests a possible link between low-calorie diets and PsA, these findings remain exploratory and require validation before informing dietary recommendations.
