                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AI voice startup WellSaid Labs is doubling down on its niche of enterprise customers and regulated industries — hoping that a more judicious, behind-the-scenes approach will pay off for its business in the long run even as flashier rivals draw widespread attention and controversy. The company, based in Bellevue, Wash., launched a new version of its text-to-speech AI voice platform Monday with redesigned Studio software and its next-generation Caruso voice model, promising better workflows, improved audio quality, and fine-tuned controls, among other features. Unlike open voice-generation models that scrape public data, WellSaid's system is trained exclusively on licensed voice actor recordings, a closed-model approach that it says respects intellectual property and appeals to sectors such as healthcare, legal, and finance. WellSaid's latest release is a pivotal moment for the company — the result of years of internal research now coming to market in a form that refines its focus on business and institutional users, said Chris Johnson, WellSaid's chief product and technology officer, in an interview. WellSaid, which spun out of Seattle's AI2 Incubator in 2019, works with large enterprise customers including LinkedIn, T-Mobile, ServiceNow, and Accenture. But WellSaid has struggled at times to break into the larger industry conversation. WellSaid executives say they're hoping to correct that specific oversight, but the challenge reflects a broader pattern among enterprise AI companies, particularly those in the Seattle region — which often emphasize trust, governance, and regulatory scenarios in a tech culture still captivated by headline-generating Silicon Valley experiments and consumer apps. The company employs about 70 people, down slightly from a year ago, according to LinkedIn data. WellSaid has seen some turnover in its executive suite, including three CEOs in less than two years — starting with founder Matt Hocking, then Brian Cook, and now Benjamin Dorr, who succeeded Cook earlier this year after serving as chief financial officer. “Every voice is connected to a real person, and that person receives royalties from the revenue that's generated on WellSaid,” Dorr said on a recent episode of the Master Move podcast.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The massive outage that hit Amazon Web Services early Monday and took down several major sites and services was due to an internal issue within the cloud giant's infrastructure. The outage impacted everything from sites including Facebook, Coinbase, and Amazon itself, to check-in kiosks at LaGuardia Airport. Amazon said it was seeing connectivity and API recovery for AWS services. Dr. Aybars Tuncdogan, an associate professor at King's College London, said it serves as warning sign for a potentially more disruptive situation. “If a comparable vulnerability were deliberately targeted by malicious actors, the damage would be far worse,” Tuncodgan said. The problems began shortly after midnight Pacific in Amazon's Northern Virginia (US-EAST-1) region, which is AWS's oldest and largest cloud region, a popular nerve center for online services. Major outages originating from this same region also caused widespread disruptions in 2017, 2021, and 2023. In an initial update, AWS said the outage was related to a DNS resolution issue with DynamoDB, meaning the internet's phone book failed to find the correct address for a database service used by thousands of apps to store and find data. “It's like agricultural monoculture — when everything relies on a single strain, one disease can wipe out entire plantations, because they all have the same genetics,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rog Xbox Ally's pricing has been a point of contention. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. The Rog Xbox Ally launched to solid reviews this past week, with many praising its performance capabilities in a vacuum, while criticizing the cost and questioning how much of an Xbox product this really is. Xbox is one of three players in the mainstream console market, alongside PlayStation and Nintendo. These three differentiate themselves from PC by offering an integrated package that has a much better value proposition. For instance, even today, the PS5 hardware for ~$500 is a great deal, considering similar performance would likely cost you more on PC. That's certainly a controversial statement that many won't agree with, especially considering how weak the Z2A-powered standard Xbox Ally is. Bond also hinted at Microsoft's next-gen hardware, which she says is in the prototyping and design stage. She said Microsoft's partnership with AMD would provide an opportunity to innovate and bring gamers a choice. Beyond rumors, we only have speculative fiction to gossip over, so let's just hope that Magnus (the name of the APU it's said to be using), being a mainline Xbox console, is more competitively priced when it arrives. Not to mention that such a partnership could yield cheaper, more attractive options in the future, now that the existing Rog Ally platform has already been utilized once.

According to photos posted by u/RunRepulsive9867, the card resembles a Founders Edition model from Nvidia's Turing generation, featuring a silver finish and dual cooling fans. Interestingly, the prototype is branded “GeForce GTX” instead of “RTX,” suggesting that it may have been an early engineering sample produced before Nvidia finalized its decision to introduce the RTX branding to emphasize its ray tracing capabilities. It also featured a wider memory bus and higher bandwidth, along with increased ROPs (Render Output Units) and TMUs (Texture Mapping Units), though there was no mention of dedicated RT (Ray Tracing) cores. Last month, we covered what appears to be the very same prototype when another Reddit user, u/Substantial-Mark-959, managed to get a faulty unit of the same card. The GPU was eventually fixed using a Founders Edition BIOS and modified drivers to function properly. Judging by its specifications, it's possible that Nvidia initially experimented with a more powerful TU102 configuration before finalizing the retail RTX 2080 Ti design. Alternatively, the card may have been part of early testing for a potential Titan or workstation variant that never saw the light of day. Engineering samples and prototypes like these don't usually make their way into the public as such units are mostly used for internal hardware validation, driver testing, and early performance benchmarking. Their existence is usually secured behind non-disclosure agreements or scrapped before official launch, which makes these working units valuable pieces of hardware for enthusiasts and collectors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For years, my local development setup has been a fragile mess of tools that never quite played nicely together. On my mac, it was a constant battle with Homebrew services starting (or not starting) on boot, conflicting PHP and Node versions managed by `asdf` or `nvm`, and a collection of `docker-compose.yml` files that I'd copy-paste and tweak for every single project. And if I wanted to run two projects that needed different versions of PostgreSQL? I'd have to stop one service to start another.I missed the simplicity of the MAMP/XAMPP era, but I needed something that could handle the diverse stack of a modern developer – not just PHP and MySQL, but Python, Go, Rust, Node.js, and various databases.That's why I (along with my small team) built ServBay. It's a native app for macOS and Windows, not a wrapper around Docker or VMs.Here's what it does:One-Click Stacks: You can install and run multiple, isolated versions of languages like Python, Node.js, Go, Java, Rust, Ruby, and .NET. No more path conflicts or environment variable hell.Databases, Plural: This was a huge one for me. You can run multiple instances of MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, and MongoDB simultaneously. Project A can use Postgres 14 while Project B uses Postgres 16, both running at the same time on different ports.Automatic SSL: Any host you create gets a valid SSL certificate out of the box. We've added a feature to easily download and run models like Llama 3 or Stable Diffusion locally through a simple UI, so you can experiment without worrying about API keys or costs.Everything Else: It also handles one-click backups, has a clean, non-intrusive UI, and is designed to be as lightweight as possible.I know what many of you are thinking: "Why not just use Docker? We use Docker for production and complex, multi-service architectures. But for quickly spinning up a single-service app, testing a new framework, or just general day-to-day development, the overhead of `Dockerfile`s, `docker-compose.yml`, slow file sync on macOS, and resource consumption often feels like overkill.

No more path conflicts or environment variable hell.Databases, Plural: This was a huge one for me. You can run multiple instances of MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, and MongoDB simultaneously. Project A can use Postgres 14 while Project B uses Postgres 16, both running at the same time on different ports.Automatic SSL: Any host you create gets a valid SSL certificate out of the box. We've added a feature to easily download and run models like Llama 3 or Stable Diffusion locally through a simple UI, so you can experiment without worrying about API keys or costs.Everything Else: It also handles one-click backups, has a clean, non-intrusive UI, and is designed to be as lightweight as possible.I know what many of you are thinking: "Why not just use Docker? We use Docker for production and complex, multi-service architectures. But for quickly spinning up a single-service app, testing a new framework, or just general day-to-day development, the overhead of `Dockerfile`s, `docker-compose.yml`, slow file sync on macOS, and resource consumption often feels like overkill.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Creative design giant Adobe is beefing up the products it offers businesses to include custom generative AI models. Adobe launched Adobe AI Foundry on Monday, a new offering that allows enterprises to work with the company to build custom generative AI models trained on their branding and intellectual property. These Firefly models were launched in 2023 and have been trained entirely on licensed data. Adobe's foundry service then fine tunes these models for each customer using their intellectual property. The foundry service pricing is based on usage, as opposed to by seat like many of Adobe's other products. Hannah Elsakr, a vice president of generative AI new business ventures at Adobe, told TechCrunch the foundry service was a natural expansion of the company's enterprise AI products — and customers were asking for more customization. “This is elevating a lot of the capabilities we already had,” Elsakr said. Since Adobe released its Firefly models in 2023, enterprises have used them to create more than 25 billion assets. Elsakr said these custom models will help brands be able to better keep up with their advertising campaigns. “We have been for decades in the business of providing creative tooling that helps uplift narrative, telling storytelling, your ability to envision and execute your creative vision.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Like many business disputes, it began with a letter from an attorney. The letter was misleading, accusatory, and, in my view, defamatory. I immediately sat down and hammered out a response, channeling all my indignation into a multi-page, point-by-point rebuttal that was technically accurate but dripping with sarcasm and anger. I felt a fleeting sense of satisfaction and was ready to hit “send.” Then, I uploaded my own angry draft and asked for a critique. Instead, it would almost certainly provoke an equally aggressive response that could lock me into a costly and draining legal battle. Then, I gave Gemini a new prompt: “Acting as a senior legal strategist, rewrite my response to be powerful, firm, and professional, with the primary goal of resolving this dispute quickly and favorably.” The AI was concise, surgically precise, and devoid of emotion. The result was a far more powerful and effective document than anything I could have written in my emotional state. Let's talk about how AI can steady our decisions under pressure, and we'll close with my Product of the Week: the ROG Xbox Ally X handheld game console. Before sending any important email or letter, you can use it as a tone-checker and strategist. Is it likely to achieve my goal of [state your goal]?” can provide invaluable feedback, catching phrases that might be unintentionally ambiguous or aggressive. For preparing papers and reports, AI is the most powerful research assistant ever created. It can help you brainstorm outlines, summarize dense academic papers or financial reports, and identify potential gaps in your arguments. This ability to play devil's advocate helps you create far more robust and complete work. The most infamous examples of this come from the legal world, where attorneys have faced sanctions and severe professional embarrassment after submitting briefs to courts that cited non-existent legal cases and fictional precedents created by an AI. Avoiding these traps requires a disciplined approach to how you prompt and use the technology: Just as you wouldn't rely on a single human advisor for every issue, you shouldn't rely on a single AI. The most effective way to use them is in concert. First, you might use Gemini for its creative brainstorming and ability to generate a strong initial draft. Then, you can take that draft to Claude, known for its nuanced understanding of complex language and its more cautious, thoughtful responses, with a prompt like, “Act as a skeptical editor. Review this text and identify any weak arguments, logical fallacies, or areas where the tone is inappropriate.” By using multiple AIs to critique and refine each other's work, you create a final product that is far more polished and robust than any single model could produce on its own. My encounter with that attorney's letter taught me that its greatest strength isn't its ability to write, but its ability to think — or, more accurately, to simulate a dispassionate, logical thought process that can expose the flaws in our own. By learning to prompt effectively, verify relentlessly, and leverage multiple models, we can transform AI from a simple tool into a true partner in judgment, enabling us to produce higher-quality work faster and with greater strategic insight than ever before. For decades, the portable gaming market has been largely synonymous with one name: Nintendo. Meanwhile, giants like Sony and Microsoft, despite their dominance in the home console arena, have historically struggled to carve out a significant niche. Sony's PSP and PS Vita, though technologically ambitious, struggled to achieve Nintendo-level ubiquity, hindered by proprietary media formats and a lack of sustained first-party support. After the Vita, Sony stepped away from dedicated handhelds to focus on PlayStation and remote play features. Microsoft, meanwhile, never pursued a handheld console at all—its strategy leaned instead toward cloud gaming and Xbox Game Pass streaming on mobile devices. This historical imbalance, however, is being challenged by a new wave of powerful handheld PCs. The “AI” in its name hints at future-proofing, with integrated neural processing units (NPUs) poised to enhance game performance and potentially power new AI-driven experiences as software evolves. When it comes to raw power and performance, the ROG Xbox Ally X is a legitimate powerhouse. While it won't entirely eclipse the very latest Xbox Series X console in every metric, it delivers a stunningly close experience for its form factor. Battery life, a perennial concern for portable devices of this caliber, has also seen significant improvements. Asus has clearly invested in optimizing power consumption alongside beefier batteries, allowing for extended gaming sessions that don't constantly demand a power outlet. The ergonomics are superb, feeling comfortable and intuitive even during marathon gaming sessions. Asus has prioritized a premium feel, utilizing high-quality materials that convey both durability and sophistication. The $999.99 price, while premium, positions it competitively against other high-end handheld PCs, offering a compelling value proposition given its performance and integrated software experience. A no-compromise portable gaming console isn't going to be cheap, but this is still far cheaper than a good gaming PC rig and far more portable. So, who is the ROG Xbox Ally X best for? As a holiday or birthday gift, it's an absolute dream for the dedicated Xbox gamer who wants to take their entire library on the go without compromise. It's perfect for students, frequent travelers, or anyone with limited access to a dedicated gaming setup. It's also an ideal companion for Xbox Game Pass subscribers, transforming their subscription into a truly portable library. Its success sends a clear signal to Sony and Microsoft: there's real demand for high-fidelity gaming that fits in your backpack. Rob Enderle has been an ECT News Network columnist since 2003.

During a recent interview at the Sitges Film Festival (via World of Reel), Terry Gilliam stated he's eager to direct The Defective Detective—a script he wrote over thirty years ago—as his last film. Deadline reports James Badge Dale, Matty Matheson, and Imogen Poots will star alongside Chase Sui Wonders, Sophie Wilde, Stanley Simons, Young Mazino, and Stephen Root in October, a “Halloween fugitive thriller” at A24 from Green Room director Jeremy Saulnier. During her recent appearance on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen (via Screen Rant), Bette Midler revealed she's read the script for Hocus Pocus 3 and “a lot of it” was “brilliant.” I don't know if you know the story of that, but it's not really owned by Marvel; it's a Universal property. I don't know if it'll ever really come to be, honestly. There's been so many Hulk movies already, it's like, does anyone really want another one? But I'd love one, and I do think the audiences would be into it if we could crack the nut of it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Competition to deploy commercial brain-computer interfaces is heating up. Science Corporation—a competitor to Neuralink founded by the former president of Elon Musk's brain-interface venture—has leapfrogged its rival after acquiring, at a fire-sale price, a vision implant that's in advanced testing,. The implant produces a form of “artificial vision” that lets some patients read text and do crosswords, according to a report published in the New England Journal of Medicine today. Using signals from a camera mounted on a pair of glasses, the chip emits bursts of electricity in order to bypass photoreceptor cells damaged by macular degeneration, the leading cause of vision loss in elderly people. “There's a patient in the UK and she is reading the pages of a regular book, which is unprecedented.” Until last year, the device was being developed by Pixium Vision, a French startup cofounded by Sahel, which faced bankruptcy after it couldn't raise more cash. “They could quickly access very advanced technology that's closer to the market, which is good for a company to have.” Science was founded in 2021 by Max Hodak, the first president of Neuralink, after his sudden departure from that company. Since its founding, Science has raised around $290 million, according to the venture capital database Pitchbook, and used the money to launch broad-ranging exploratory research on brain interfaces and new types of vision treatments. By acquiring the PRIMA implant program, Science effectively vaulted past years of development and testing. Unlike Neuralink's implant, which records brain signals so paralyzed recipients can use their thoughts to move a computer mouse, the retina chip sends information into the brain to produce vision. On average, the study found, they were able to read five additional lines on a vision chart—the kind with rows of letters, each smaller than the last. The type of vision loss being treated with the new implant is called geographic atrophy, in which patients have peripheral vision but can't make out objects directly in front of them, like words or faces. According to Prevent Blindness, an advocacy organization, this type of central vision loss affects around one in 10 people over 80. The implant was originally designed starting 20 years ago by Daniel Palanker, a laser expert and now a professor at Stanford University, who says his breakthrough was realizing that light beams could supply both energy and information to a chip placed under the retina. Other implants, like Argus II, use a wire, which adds complexity. That light hits the chip, which is covered by “what are basically tiny solar panels,” says Palanker. “We just try to replace the photoreceptors with a photo-array.” Palanaker says a next-generation device will have five times as many “pixels” and should let people see more: “What we discovered in the trial is that even though you stimulate individual pixels, patients perceive it as continuous. When Pixium teetered on insolvency, Palanker says, he helped search for a buyer, meeting with Hodak. During a visit to Science's headquarters, Hodak described the company's effort to redesign the system into something sleeker and more user-friendly. In the original design, in addition to the wearable camera, the patient has to carry around a bulky controller containing a battery and laser, as well as buttons to zoom in and out. But Science has already prototyped a version in which those electronics are squeezed into what look like an extra-large pair of sunglasses. “The implant is great, but we'll have new glasses on patients fairly shortly,” Hodak says. “This will substantially improve their ability to have it with them all day.” Other companies also want to treat blindness with brain-computer interfaces, but some think it might be better to send signals directly into the brain. This year, Neuralink has been touting plans for “Blindsight,” a project to send electrical signals directly into the brain's visual cortex, bypassing the retina entirely. It has yet to test the approach in a person. Artificial intelligence can design toxins that evade security controls.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That's why It: Welcome to Derry takes place in 1962, 27 years before the 1989 events of Andy Muschietti's 2017 It feature film, and 54 years before the 2016 setting of It Chapter Two. io9 recently participated in a press day for the new HBO show ahead of its arrival on October 26, speaking with Muschietti (a co-creator and executive producer on the series, in addition to being the director of multiple episodes) as well as writers, executive producers, and co-showrunners Brad Caleb Kane and Jason Fuchs. So it was unavoidable to go to ‘62; this is our first step into a bigger journey,” explained Muschietti. “It was actually exciting to talk about these things because it creates not only a look into history, but also dramatic opportunities [for] our characters … Also, ‘62 is very close to the original time [setting] of It, the book. And now we're telling a prequel that happened in ‘62, but ‘62 is very close to 1958, which is [when the novel takes place]. Kane elaborated on the setting in a separate interview with io9. “And 1962 is very much considered a time of Norman Rockwell's America; it's a time that's idealized with great innocence. Obviously it wasn't that way for everybody, but if you think of 1962 in America, before Kennedy was assassinated, as the last moment of innocence in this country, well, what happens when you scratch the surface of that innocence, that idealized time, and you find out what's underneath? I think you'll see something very different than the facade, and we tried to lean into that reality as well.” The local Native American population plays a major role in the new series, bringing in a perspective not represented in King's original story or any of its previous adaptations. “There's a part of the story that is not even in the book that is a crucial story point in this series, which tells us about the struggle of the Indigenous people against It, and that has tremendous ripple effects on generations to come.” The Indigenous people have lived with this evil much longer than anybody else, having been here longer than anyone else, and they understand that evil is not something that you can necessarily defeat,” he said. So we felt that was an important perspective. And obviously, if we're thinking about Derry as a microcosm of America, you can't tell America's story without the Indigenous perspective. And I think that was an important reason for us to do it.” While the Indigenous characters form a key part of It: Welcome to Derry, the show also aims for a microcosm feel—as Kane suggested, noting King originated the idea of looking at Derry through that lens. We spend time with the kids as they realize there's a monster in their midst. But we also get to know their parents and other adults in town, as well as the soldiers stationed on the military base nearby. It's a lot of cards to stack, but co-showrunners Kane and Fuchs didn't see it as a challenge. “I think we saw it much more as an opportunity,” Fuchs said. “TV is obviously long-form storytelling and so we had a chance to delve into different perspectives in a way that the two hours of a movie just doesn't allow you to. We were excited to go into different communities. It was all by design and something we're really excited about; it felt like this was an opportunity for something a little different.” Crafting a satisfying ending for viewers who already know the monster won't be defeated took a certain nuanced approach. “The benefit of long-form storytelling is really that you can dive into character a lot more deeply. And we're introducing a whole new set of characters in this than we saw in the movies,” Kane said. “But we try to rip the rug out from underneath people right away so you never know what's going to happen. We want to give the audience that feeling: to imbue you with love for these new characters and make you fear for their safety.” “We wanted to tell a story about unity and about innocence lost, just like the main themes of the book. We try to do all that with the characters, and that kind of journey makes it a lot more expansive than just, ‘Will It be defeated or not?' It: Welcome to Derry expands what fans know about Pennywise's history in quite a few aspects, but it's careful not to shine too bright of a light on things. As Fuchs explained, revealing details but also keeping some of that mystery intact was a delicate task. I think that what's great about the richness of Stephen King's mythology is that the more answers to mysteries you reveal, the more new mysteries suggest themselves,” Fuchs said. “So yeah, Brad and I wanted to know more about It. We wanted to understand why a being like It remains in Derry when it's a creature of light. We wanted to understand why a shape-shifter who has a virtually infinite number of forms it could take continues to take the form of Pennywise the Dancing Clown.” “So you're going to get, I hope, really satisfying answers to some of those things in the context of the show. But the answers themselves suggest fresh mysteries and new questions. It: Welcome to Derry premieres October 26 on HBO.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In late July 2024, Lina Khan, then the chair of the US Federal Trade Commission, gave a speech at an event hosted by the San Francisco startup accelerator Y Combinator in which she positioned herself as an advocate for open source artificial intelligence. The event took place as California lawmakers were considering a landmark bill called SB 1047 that would have imposed new testing and safety requirements on AI companies. Critics of the legislation, which was later vetoed by California governor Gavin Newsom, argued it would hamper the development and release of open source AI models. Khan called for a less restrictive approach and said that, with open models available to them, “smaller players can bring their ideas to market.” The piece noted that “open source” had been used to describe AI models with a variety of different characteristics. The authors instead suggested adopting the term “open-weight,” meaning a model that has its training weights released publicly, allowing anyone to inspect, modify, or reuse it. Another post from October 2023 titled “Consumers Are Voicing Concerns About AI,” authored by two FTC technologists, now similarly redirects back to the agency's Office of Technology landing page. A third FTC post about AI that was authored by Khan's staff and published on January 3, 2025, titled “AI and the Risk of Consumer Harm,” now leads to an error screen that says “Page not found.” According to the Wayback Machine, that blog post was still live on the FTC's website as of August 12, but by August 15 it had been removed from the internet. In the original post, Khan's staff had written that the agency was “increasingly taking note of AI's potential for real-world instances of harm—from incentivizing commercial surveillance to enabling fraud and impersonation to perpetuating illegal discrimination.” An FTC spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. Former FTC public affairs director Douglas Farrar tells WIRED he was especially surprised that the open weights blog was removed, given the agency's role as a key AI market regulator. The Trump administration's AI Action Plan from July argues that “we need to ensure America has leading open models founded on American values” and “the Federal government should create a supportive environment for open models.” (The FTC did not respond to questions about whether these deletions represent a shift in policy.) Several advisers working for the Trump administration on technology issues, including David Sacks, special adviser to the White House on AI and crypto, and Sriram Krishnan, a senior policy adviser to the White House on AI, have also advocated for open source AI, framing it as a critical means for the US to maintain its technological dominance. In March, the FTC removed some 300 posts related to AI, consumer protection, and the agency's lawsuits against tech giants like Amazon and Microsoft. One post titled “The Luring Test: AI and the engineering of consumer trust” offered guidance to tech companies about how to avoid building deceptive AI chatbots. An FTC source told WIRED in March that removing public blog posts “raises serious compliance concerns under the Federal Records Act and the Open Government Data Act,” which require government agencies to preserve records that have administrative, legal, or historical value and make them accessible to the public.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to Anthropic, it had partnered with the Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) to make sure Claude wouldn't spill nuclear secrets. A lot of the information about America's most advanced nuclear weapons is Top Secret, but the original nuclear science is 80 years old. North Korea proved that a dedicated country with an interest in acquiring the bomb can do it, and it didn't need a chatbot's help. How, exactly, did the US government work with an AI company to make sure a chatbot wasn't spilling sensitive nuclear secrets? The DOE already had several of these servers when it started to work with Anthropic. “We deployed a then-frontier version of Claude in a Top Secret environment so that the NNSA could systematically test whether AI models could create or exacerbate nuclear risks,” Marina Favaro, who oversees National Security Policy & Partnerships at Anthropic tells WIRED. “Since then, the NNSA has been red-teaming successive Claude models in their secure cloud environment and providing us with feedback.” “We built it using a list developed by the NNSA of nuclear risk indicators, specific topics, and technical details that help us identify when a conversation might be veering into harmful territory. The list itself is controlled but not classified, which is crucial, because it means our technical staff and other companies can implement it.” Favaro says it took months of tweaking and testing to get the classifier working. “It catches concerning conversations without flagging legitimate discussions about nuclear energy or medical isotopes,” she says. Both NNSA and Anthropic were vague about the “potential risks in these domains,” and it's unclear how helpful Claude or any other chatbot would be in the construction of a nuclear weapon. “I don't dismiss these concerns, I think they are worth taking seriously,” Oliver Stephenson, an AI expert at the Federation of American Scientists, tells WIRED. “I don't think the models in their current iteration are incredibly worrying in most cases, but I do think we don't know where they'll be in five years time … and it's worth being prudent about that fact.” Stephenson points out that much is hidden behind a barrier of classification, so it's hard to know what impact Anthropic's classifier has had. “You need to structure them very precisely to perfectly compress the core to get a high yield explosion … I could imagine that being the kind of thing where AI could help synthesize information from a bunch of different physics papers, a bunch of different publications on nuclear weapons.” Still, he says, AI companies should be more specific when they talk about safety. “When Anthropic puts out stuff like this, I'd like to see them talking in a little more detail about the risk model they're really worried about,” he says. “It is good to see collaboration between AI companies and the government, but there is always the danger with classification that you put a lot of trust into people determining what goes into those classifiers.” For Heidy Khlaaf, the chief AI scientist at the AI Now Institute with a background in nuclear safety, Anthropic's promise that Claude won't help someone build a nuke is both a magic trick and security theater. “If the NNSA probed a model which was not trained on sensitive nuclear material, then their results are not an indication that their probing prompts were comprehensive, but that the model likely did not contain the data or training to demonstrate any sufficient nuclear capabilities,” Khlaaf tells WIRED. “This work seems to be relying on an unsubstantiated assumption that Antrophic's models will produce emergent nuclear capabilities without further training, and that is simply not aligned with the available science,” she says. “A lot of our safety work is focused on proactively building safety systems that can identify future risks and mitigate against them,” an Anthropic spokesperson tells WIRED. Companies like Anthropic are hungry for training data, and she sees the US government's broader rush to embrace AI as an opportunity for the AI industry to acquire data it couldn't get elsewhere. “These are precise sciences, and we know that large language models have failure modes in which they're unable to even do the most basic mathematics,” Khlaaf says. To Anthropic's credit, it says it doesn't want a future where people are using chatbots to play around with nuclear weapons science.
