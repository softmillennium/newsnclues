                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anthropic on Monday announced Claude for Life Sciences, a new offering for researchers to use the company's artificial intelligence technology in the advancement of scientific discovery. Claude for Life Sciences is built around Anthropic's existing AI models, but supports new connections with other scientific tools that are commonly used in labs during research and development. It will be able to help researchers through all stages of the discovery process, from carrying out literature reviews to developing hypotheses, analyzing data, drafting regulatory submissions and more, Anthropic said. The launch of Claude for Life Sciences marks Anthropic's first formal entry into the sector, and comes just months after the company hired longtime industry executive Eric Kauderer-Abrams as its head of biology and life sciences. "Now is the threshold moment for us where we've decided this is a big investment area," Kauderer-Abrams told CNBC in an interview. It was founded in 2021 by a group of former OpenAI executives and researchers, and its valuation has swelled to $183 billion in just four years. The company launched a new model, Claude Sonnet 4.5, late last month and said it is "significantly better" at life sciences tasks like understanding laboratory protocols. That meant Anthropic had to establish integrations with key players in the life sciences ecosystem, including Benchling, PubMed, 10x Genomics and Synapse.org, among others. Anthropic has also partnered with companies that can help life sciences organizations adopt AI, like Caylent, KPMG, Deloitte, and cloud providers AWS and Google Cloud, the company said. "We're willing and enthusiastic about doing that grind to make sure that all the pieces come together," Kauderer-Abrams said. In a prerecorded demo, Anthropic showed how a scientist working on preclinical studies could use Claude for Life Sciences to compare two study designs that test different dosing strategies. The scientist was able to query her lab's data directly from Benchling, generate a summary and tables of key differences with links back to the original material. Anthropic said an analysis like this used to require "days" of validating and compiling information, but now, it can be done in minutes. Kauderer-Abrams said the company believes AI can bring about real efficiency gains for the life sciences sector, but it's also under "no illusions" that it will magically overcome the physical limitations of conducting scientific research. Instead, Anthropic is focused on exploring the time-consuming, expensive parts of the discovery process "piece by piece" to determine where AI could be most useful.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple shares rose 4% on Monday as a new report showed iPhone 17 sales off to a strong start in the U.S. and China. The iPhone 17 series, which dropped in September, has outsold the iPhone 16 series by 14% in the U.S. and China within its first 10 days of availability, according to data from Counterpoint research. "The base model iPhone 17 is very compelling to consumers, offering great value for money," Counterpoint senior analyst Mengmeng Zhang said in the report. "A better chip, improved display, higher base storage, selfie camera upgrade – all for the same price as last year's iPhone 16. Buying this device is a no brainer, especially when you throw channel discounts and coupons into the mix." The company is positioned to rally with demand for the latest iPhone generation exceeding expectations, according to Loop Capital. The investment bank upgraded Apple from hold to buy, raising its price target to $315 per share from $226. "While [Wall] Street is baking in some degree of outperformance from AAPL's iPhone 17 family of products, we believe there remains material upside to Street expectations through CY2027," Loop Capital's Ananda Baruah said in a note to clients on Monday. Last week, Apple CEO Tim Cook visited employees and government officials in China, and appeared at a launch for Apple's new iPhone Air, which reportedly sold out in minutes after going on sale, according to the South China Morning Post. In a note on Sunday, Evercore analyst Amit Daryanani said that the iPhone Air's apparent popularity in China may boost Apple shares. The Evercore analysts wrote in the note that Apple is poised to report strong numbers during next week's earnings report. Apple shares have had an up-and-down year so far. The stock is up about 5% in 2025, significantly lagging big Magnificent 7 winners Nvidia, Meta, Microsoft and Alphabet, but has roared 24% over the last 3 months.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TKMS, the German warship manufacturer which has spun out from parent group Thyssenkrupp, plans to capitalize on the expected surge in Europe's defense spend with "prudent, margin-oriented growth" after debuting on Frankfurt's stock exchange Monday. The initial public offering saw TKMS launch at around 60 euros ($70) per share — giving it a market value of around 3.8 billion euros ($4.4 billion) — drawing strong demand from investors. Industrial engineering giant Thyssenkrupp will continue to hold a 51% stake in the company following the offering. The company, also known as Thyssenkrupp Marine Services, builds both submarines and surface vessels, as well as electronics and software technology, which TKMS CEO Oliver Burkhard called the "jewel in the chest box" of the company. This includes sonar equipment and certain autonomous devices, which are critical in the so-called 'mighty domain' operations "which is the next big thing in military warfare," Burkhard told CNBC's "Europe Early Edition" on Monday. The IPO will enable the company to raise capital and expand capacity amid an anticipated ramp-up in demand for stronger defense capability, particularly in the naval sector, in Europe in the coming decades. Burkhard said TKMS has an order backlog of 18.6 billion euros, which will mean the company will likely remain at full capacity towards 2040, with one submarine typically taking between 5 and 15 years to build. TKMS has doubled its capacity in recent years, and now has two shipyards where it can build state-of-the-art submarines, which can remain underwater for weeks at a time. "With that capacity we're having, we can of course build our order book and we can also take on other orders," Burkhard said, adding that the firm is targeting "prudent, margin-oriented growth." The company benefits from a "robust" supply chain, about 90% of which is in Europe, mostly in Germany, he said. The Stoxx Europe Aerospace and Defense index advanced about 2.7% by close, with battle tank parts maker Renk closing 6.7% higher, defense technology firm Hensoldt rising almost 7.9%, and Rheinmetall settling on a gain of 5.9%. Gareth McCartney, global co-head of equity capital markets at UBS, said TKMS' public debut comes at a time when investors are sitting on considerable liquidity, and have demonstrated a solid appetite for IPOs in the region. "We now have a catalyst over the last few months with both defense and infrastructure spending very much at the core of what international investors are looking for when they look towards investing in Europe," McCartney told CNBC's "Europe Early Edition" on Monday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Monday that Elon Musk's SpaceX is falling "behind" the U.S. timeline to return to the moon with Artemis and he will open the contract to other companies. "We're not going to wait for one company," Duffy, who is currently the acting NASA administrator, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Monday. SpaceX did not immediately return a request for comment. SpaceX is among the various contractors participating in NASA's Artemis mission, which aims to establish the "first long-term presence on the Moon" and prepare for missions to Mars. Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman are also supporting the mission. SpaceX won a contract in 2021 to provide a lunar landing system for astronauts on the Artemis III mission. Duffy said Monday that he thinks the April launch can happen in early February and the agency is looking to get "back to the moon in 2028" with two potential companies. Duffy highlighted Blue Origin as a potential competitor that could take over. "They push their timelines out, and we're in a race against China," Duffy said of SpaceX. Rocket tests for SpaceX and the space sector haven't always been smooth sailing. The company launched its eleventh Starship test rocket earlier this month following a string of stumbling blocks and explosions. Firefly Aerospace's Alpha rocket exploded last month, shortly after the Federal Aviation Administration cleared it to continue testing. The ongoing government shutdown could put a dent in plans to reopen contracts. CNBC's request for comment on the contracting process was answered with an automatic reply that the agency was closed. CNBC previously reported that NASA employees working on the Artemis missions with contractors such as SpaceX and Blue Origin would continue working during the shutdown.

Americans continue to run into issues accessing many online services on Monday afternoon as Amazon works to mitigate a major Amazon Web Service outage. A status page for Amazon's cloud unit showed more than 80 of its own services were affected at the outage's peak Monday morning. While the company said the underlying issue had been "fully mitigated" and that most AWS service operations are "succeeding normally now" at 6:35 am ET, a new wave of issues appeared to crop up later in the morning for many US users. ET, AWS reported "significant API errors and connectivity issues across multiple services in the US-EAST-1 Region." Reports on Downdetector, a site that tracks online outages, trended up for Amazon, Venmo, and Pinterest. Many other online services that use AWS' cloud services and infrastructure, including Zoom, Strava, and Amazon's Alexa assistant, appeared to experience outages early Monday morning, according to Downdetector. User reports also indicated problems with workplace tools, including Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Asana. Aravind Srinivas, the CEO of AI startup Perplexity, said in an X post at 3:22 a.m. "The root cause is an AWS issue," he said. The outage lasted about three hours, with some companies reporting that their services are running again while others are still experiencing issues. Robinhood said in a post on X that its services are "back online and recovering," while a Snapchat spokesperson told Business Insider the company is aware that some users are experiencing issues with the app and advised them to "hang tight" while it investigates. T-Mobile was listed as showing issues on Downdetector but a company spokesperson told Business Insider that it didn't experience an outage on its own service, and that its customers "had issues when trying to use other sites or services due to a third party's outage early this morning." An Amazon spokesperson directed Business Insider to its service status page. On Monday morning, AWS's status page showed that DynamoDB, its database service underpinning many online applications, was experiencing "significant error rates" for requests to its data centers located on the US East Coast. In July last year, a faulty software update from cybersecurity company CrowdStrike caused computers around the world to crash, sparking chaos for airlines, hospitals, banks, and businesses. "Today's outage is another reminder that the digital world doesn't stop at borders — a local fault can ripple worldwide in minutes," said Charlotte Wilson, head of enterprise at Check Point Software, a cybersecurity company.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Activist investor Jana Partners has taken a stake in medical device maker Cooper Companies and will push the firm to explore strategic options, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday. Shares of Cooper Companies jumped 6% in premarket trading Monday. The hedge fund, founded by Barry Rosenstein and known for pressuring companies to make changes that enhance shareholder value, also intends to urge Cooper to improve how it allocates capital in order to boost returns, said the Journal, which cited sources close to the matter. CNBC reached out to Jana Partners for comment and didn't immediately hear back. Jana may encourage Cooper to consider merging its contact-lens business with rival Bausch + Lomb, the Journal reported. Cooper recently cut its full-year revenue outlook in August, citing weaker demand in some markets. The stock is down nearly 22% this year. — Click here to read the original WSJ story.

Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin said that the state had "failed" to protect one of its most famous landmarks after thieves used a truck and a freight elevator to steal "priceless" jewels from the museum's Galerie d'Apollon on Sunday morning. Speaking on France Inter radio on Monday morning, Darmanin said: "We cannot completely secure all locations, but what is certain is that we have failed, since it is possible to set up a freight elevator in the middle of a Paris street, lift people up in a matter of minutes to steal priceless jewelry, and give France a terrible image." They then targeted several display cases before escaping on motor scooters, he said. "They stole jewelry that I won't list, as I believe there is a criminal investigation underway, but which is jewelry that has real heritage value and is actually priceless," Nuñez said, adding that the heist lasted around seven minutes in total. Macron added that the Louvre Nouvelle Renaissance project, launched in January, includes enhanced security measures "to ensure the preservation and protection of what constitutes our memory and our culture." Culture Minister Rachida Dati said on Sunday afternoon that no injuries had been reported and that she was at the scene with museum staff and police.</p>

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. Inflation isn't just driving up the cost of rent and groceries — it's coming for your lunch break, too. And as costs climb, a growing number of workers say they're skipping meals entirely to save money. The report, based on the results of an online survey conducted in June 2025 among 1,000 full-time US employees in on-site or hybrid roles, found that, on average, employees buy lunch 2.6 times each week, spending around $34.82 a week buying lunch out — up 26% compared to last year. Business Insider previously reported that skipping lunch can harm a worker's mental, physical, and social health. "Our data shows that hangry workers are bad for business: 43% take longer to complete tasks, 38% report being blunt with colleagues, and 25% avoid interacting with their peers," Robert Kaskel, VP of People at ezCater, said of the report's findings. The ezCater report found that not only are younger workers more inclined to skip lunch, they're also more likely to feel guilty about taking a lunch break at all. Business Insider has previously reported that Gen Z employees are more likely than their older colleagues to feel anxiety at work. "When your youngest employees feel guilty about taking their lunch break, it's a big red flag," Kaskel said. If lunch has become a luxury, it's one the modern workplace can't afford to lose.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon Web Services, a leader in the cloud infrastructure market, reported a major outage on Monday, taking down numerous major websites. Many sites came back online within a few hours, although Downdetector showed another spike in user reports around noon ET of outages at Amazon, AWS and Alexa. ET, AWS said it was working to identify the "root cause" for the network connectivity issues impacting some of its services. "We continue to investigate and identify migrations." A notice on AWS' status page said it was experiencing DNS problems with DynamoDB, its database service that underpins many other AWS applications. DNS, or Domain Name System, translates website names to IP addresses so browsers and other applications can load. AWS cited an "operational issue" affecting "multiple services" and said it was "working on multiple parallel paths to accelerate recovery," in an update at 5:01 a.m. More than 70 of its own services were affected. Shortly afterward, AWS said it was seeing "significant signs of recovery." Downdetector showed user reports indicating problems at sites including Disney+, Lyft, the McDonald's app, The New York Times, Reddit, Ring doorbells, Robinhood, Snapchat, United Airlines and Venmo. A government spokesperson told CNBC: "We are aware of an incident affecting Amazon Web Services, and several online services which rely on their infrastructure. Through our established incident response arrangements, we are in contact with the company, who are working to restore services as quickly as possible." Lloyds Banking Group confirmed that some of its services were affected and asked customers "to bear with us" while it worked to restore them. Some 20 minutes later, it added that services were coming back online. The outage also brought down critical tools inside Amazon. Warehouse and delivery employees, along with drivers for Amazon's Flex service, reported on Reddit that internal systems were offline at many sites. Some warehouse workers were instructed to stand by in break rooms and loading areas during their shift, while they couldn't load Amazon's Anytime Pay app, which lets employees access a portion of their paycheck immediately. Seller Central, the hub used by Amazon's third-party sellers to manage their businesses, was also knocked offline by the outage. Some United and Delta Air Lines customers reported on social media that they couldn't find their reservations online, check in or drop bags. Canvas, an online teaching platform used to host course information and submit assignments, said it was also hit by the "ongoing AWS incident." Other social media users cited disruption across cloud-based games, including Roblox and Fortnite, while crypto exchange Coinbase said many users were unable to access the service due to the outage. Graphic design tool Canva said it was "experiencing significantly increased error rates which are impacting functionality on Canva. There is a major issue with our underlying cloud provider." Generative artificial intelligence search tool Perplexity was also affected. It's not the first time in recent history that major companies have been affected by a technical issue. In July 2024, a faulty software upgrade by cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike revealed the fragility of global technology infrastructure when it caused Microsoft Windows systems to go dark, creating millions of dollars worth of chaos and grounding thousands of flights in the process. AWS has also experienced other outages in recent years. A disruption in 2023 knocked many websites offline for several hours, while a more severe outage in 2021 affected websites and services across the globe, including some of Amazon's own delivery operations, which were briefly brought to a standstill. "There's no sign that this AWS outage was caused by a cyberattack - it looks like a technical fault affecting one of Amazon's main data centres," Rob Jardin, chief digital officer at cybersecurity company NymVPN, said in a statement. "These issues can happen when systems become overloaded or a key part of the network goes down, and because so many websites and apps rely on AWS, the impact spreads quickly." An Amazon spokesperson pointed to AWS' service health dashboard when reached for comment. Indeed, "DynamoDB isn't a term that most consumers know," Mike Chapple, IT professor at the University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business and former computer scientist with the National Security Agency, said in a statement. "We'll learn more in the hours and days ahead but early reports indicate that this wasn't actually a problem with the database itself. Instead, something went wrong with the records that tell other systems where to find their data," he added.

After years of working remotely for companies in North America, I landed a remote role as the head of growth at a European creator tech company in January. I wanted to move back into sales and join a tech company, and this role checked both of those boxes. My original team operates almost entirely out of North America, but the rest of the company operates on Central European Time. After about two weeks, I realized that working a normal 9-5 schedule left me little time to work with them, build key stakeholder relationships, and ensure I was bringing my best to the role, so I switched my schedule from 5 a.m. to 2 p.m. Eastern. The first month and a half was exhausting, but I adjusted. Now, I'm often in a meeting at the beginning of my day or coworking with another team lead. About an hour before my teams in North America log on, I review everyone's calendars so I know what they have going on in their day and can shift work around so nobody is overburdened. I also review our active deals so I can help things close and ensure we hit or exceed our weekly target. By the time we have our morning team huddle at 9:30 a.m., I've solved problems, set a clear road map for the day, and done most of my own stuff so I can be available to them for whatever they need. I stop working on work things somewhere between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. most days. I do my best to leave at 2 p.m., but management is never a 40-hour-a-week job. I get maybe two or three messages a day after 2 p.m., and it takes me less than five minutes to get to whatever the team's asking me for, so I really don't mind having to hop back in briefly. I wasn't sure how working for a predominantly European company would go, as most of what I knew about work culture in Europe came from TV, but it's been overwhelmingly positive. My colleagues have dedicated lunch breaks, so I started taking one for the first time. The company has menstrual leave and a flexible sick days policy, so I also never feel the pressure to show up if I'm not well. At North American companies I've worked for, I was expected to do calls the day after a hip replacement while still in the hospital and work through having COVID-19. Many of my colleagues take their vacation days without logging into work at all. I always had to leave a method of communication at North American companies, and people reached out to me frequently. I love to travel, so this is a huge perk of the job. I have a six-figure revenue stream in career coaching and fractional C-level AI consulting services. In the current market, I'm busy reviewing and rewriting résumés and LinkedIn profiles, helping out-of-work job seekers prep for interviews, and helping current employees set themselves up for a promotion in the next fiscal year. I write for publications about careers, leadership, AI, and travel, and I'm a coach in a program that helps people grow their LinkedIn following with strategic content. Now, I work from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. on those revenue streams.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump has signaled a shift in support toward Russia's Vladimir Putin as he looks for a quick end to the war in Ukraine, likely striking fear into Ukrainian officials. Trump held a tense meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday, with the potential supply of U.S. long-range cruise missiles, Tomahawks, on the agenda. Zelenskyy walked away from the meeting not only empty-handed, but apparently upbraided by Trump, who said Ukraine should accept Russia's terms for ending the war — by handing over the entire eastern territory of Donbas, the epicenter of ongoing fighting in Ukraine. "It's cut up right now, I think 78% of the land is already taken by Russia," he said on Air Force One on Sunday. "They should stop right now at the battle lines. ... Go home, stop killing people and be done." In the meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump also warned the Ukrainian leader that Putin had told him — in a lengthy phone call on Thursday in which they agreed to hold in-person talks in Hungary — that Russia would "destroy" Ukraine if it did not agree to the demand. In a Truth Social post, Trump described the meeting as "very interesting, and cordial," but said he had "strongly suggested" to both leaders that it was time to end the war. Zelenskyy put on a brave face, telling NBC News' "Meet the Press," in an interview recorded Friday after the meeting with Trump, that "we are not losing this war, and Putin is not winning." He also remained optimistic despite leaving the White House without the Tomahawk missiles he was coveting. "It's good that President Trump didn't say 'no,' but for today, didn't say 'yes,'" Zelenskyy told "Meet the Press" moderator Kristen Welker in the interview, which aired Sunday. He also said he was ready to join Putin and Trump's upcoming summit in Budapest, which could take place in the next few weeks. As well as declining to provide Tomahawk missiles for Ukraine, which Trump had previously mooted in an apparent bid to bring Russia to the negotiating table, Trump also mused about giving security guarantees to both Kyiv and Moscow, Reuters reported, citing two sources familiar with the talks. As for Moscow, Putin's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, told CNBC on Monday in emailed comments that the Kremlin welcomes "Trump's efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement in Ukraine." Close followers of Trump-Putin-Zelenskyy relations fear the U.S. president is easily swayed by the veteran Russian leader's arguments over Ukraine. They say Trump does not appear ready or willing to exert more pressure on Putin, be it in the form of more arms transfers to Kyiv, or more economic restrictions on Russia. "We keep dismissing Donald Trump as kind of 'Everybody's Fool' because he's so bombastic and says many things a mile a minute, but he actually is being very transactional about the relationship," Nina Khrushcheva, professor of international affairs at The New School, told CNBC "Squawk Box" on Friday. She noted that Trump still wants to win over Putin, but is also keeping him on a "tight leash," demonstrated by his threat to give Ukraine more weapons. "So far, I think it is working. He's not giving either side what they wanted, but he keeps going, and eventually, potentially, they may agree to some sort of a peace agreement," she said. Michael O'Hanlon, director of foreign policy research at the Brookings Institution, told CNBC that Putin is likely to wait Trump out. "I think it would be more effective [for Trump] to combine the military threat with greater economic pressure, but we'll see maybe that comes later," he noted Friday. O'Hanlon said there were several ways the U.S. could ramp up the pressure on Moscow, including another U.S. aid package for Ukraine and a bigger crackdown on Russia's "shadow fleet" of tankers facilitating shipments of Russian crude to circumvent the oil price cap and sanctions. "We don't do much trading with Russia, but, of course, other countries do, and I think it's time to talk to not just India, but also China about a strategy whereby they would consider reducing their interaction, their economic interaction, and you threaten secondary sanctions if you don't get that kind of help," he said. They can be phased in, but I think President Trump is a little too fixated on just the Tomahawks, plus his personal rapport with Putin, and I don't think that's going to be enough [to stop Russia]."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gucci owner Kering has agreed to sell its beauty business to L'Oreal for 4 billion euros ($4.66 billion), in a major shift in strategy by new CEO Luca de Meo as he moves to tackle the luxury group's high debt and refocus on its core fashion business. Under the deal, French beauty giant L'Oreal will acquire Kering's fragrance line Creed, which former CEO Francois-Henri Pinault acquired in 2023 for 3.5 billion euros, as well as exclusive rights to develop fragrance and beauty products for 50 years under Kering's fashion labels including Bottega Veneta and Balenciaga. L'Oreal will also get the Gucci license, also for 50 years, once a deal with Coty, which analysts believe to last until 2028, expires. "We believe selling Kering Beauté at around the same price paid for Creed two years ago is bitter but necessary medicine," said analysts at Bernstein. While the idea of selling the beauty business had been identified as an option before de Meo officially took charge in September, the Italian dramatically accelerated discussions with L'Oreal this month, two sources familiar with the matter said. Kering beauty will be L'Oreal's largest acquisition to date, bigger than its purchase of Australian brand Aesop for $2.5 billion in 2023. Shares in Kering jumped 4.7% while L'Oreal rose 1.4%. The sale is a significant step towards reducing Kering's net debt, which stood at 9.5 billion euros at the end of June, on top of 6 billion euros in long-term lease liabilities, sparking investor concern. It is also a major shift in direction by De Meo less than two months after taking the helm, as he unwinds one of the biggest strategic pivots made by his predecessor Francois-Henri Pinault, whose family controls the group, in recent years. Kering is also battling declining growth at its largest brand Gucci as demand in the key Chinese market slowed. Gucci's revenue plummeted 25% year-on-year in the last reported quarter, increasing the pressure on Kering to deleverage to avoid further credit downgrades. De Meo, who took over as CEO in September, had told shareholders he planned to take some difficult decisions to reduce debt at the group, including rationalising and reorganising where necessary. The company has also postponed a plan to fully acquire Italian fashion brand Valentino, and is aiming to sell stakes in its real estate to raise cash. L'Oreal, the maker of Maybelline make-up and CeraVe skincare, already produces blockbuster perfumes under the Yves Saint Laurent label after acquiring rights to the brand from Kering for 1.15 billion euros in 2008. The two companies also said they were setting up a joint venture to provide experiences and services for luxury clients. Fragrances, which account for about 14% of L'Oreal's 2024 revenues, according to Bernstein, were growing in double-digit figures in the second quarter at L'Oreal, outperforming the segment. "L'Oreal enjoys strong momentum in the Luxe division and they must be looking forward to getting hold of the perfume and beauty licences associated with Kering's prestigious yet relatively underdeveloped brands," said Bruno-Roland Bernard, a consultant and adjunct professor for corporate finance and luxury management at Paris-based Institut Francais de la Mode. "It's also possible they are taking advantage of a favourable bargaining position - with limited competition: who has the credentials and the firepower to deal with a Kering under time pressure?" It is not clear where the deal leaves talks between Armani group and L'Oreal, which was named in the will of late designer Giorgio Armani as one of the preferred buyers for a minority stake in his fashion house.

Palmer Luckey says his defense startup Anduril has an internal strategy that guides everything it does: "China 27." "The idea is that anything we are working on, anything that we are investing in, needs to be built with the assumption that sometime in 2027, China is going to move on Taiwan," Luckey said on a recent episode of the "Joe Rogan Experience" podcast. "And I might be wrong on this, right? "But, in general, like imagine how stupid I'll feel if I spend hundreds of millions of dollars building some new weapon system that I know is not going to come into service until the 2030s, which is what most experts say is outside of the window of when this invasion would happen," he said. "Wouldn't I feel pretty stupid if there's a gigantic fight and I've spent all my money on something that wasn't ready in time?" Luckey added that he thinks a full-scale invasion of Taiwan isn't likely to be the route the Chinese want to take, and that it would opt for a blockade instead to choke off the island. "You want to have things like sea mining capabilities that make a blockade basically impossible to affect without destroying the entire fleet. You want things like missiles and counter-missile systems that make it impossible to lock in the country." Luckey told Rogan that he went to Taiwan just a few weeks ago to personally deliver "a bunch of missiles and weapon systems that are specifically to counter a Chinese invasion." He also added that, in his opinion, the US should avoid getting into a "shooting war" where US troops are being sent to "die for other countries." You got to keep things on the shelves. You need to not arbitrarily cut off allies." Representatives for Luckey at Anduril directed Business Insider to his comments on the podcast. Under Luckey, Anduril has carved out a space for itself in a defense industry dominated by the prime weapons contractors. Meta in May announced that it would partner with Anduril to design and build next-generation extended reality gear for military use. Anduril said in a May 29 press release that the project is "funded through private capital, without taxpayer support, and is designed to save the US military billions of dollars." Anduril revealed a suite of products called EagleEye on October 13. The devices range from helmets to visors and glasses, and feature displays that Anduril says can display data like teammates' locations on top of a soldier's view of a live battlefield. Anduril's also giving defense heavyweights a run for their money on the drone front. In March, it scored a 10-year, $642 million contract with the US Marine Corps for anti-drone defenses geared toward fighting smaller drones.</p>

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Steven Qiu, the founder of Chinese LiDAR maker RoboSense, says a multi-sensor system is a better and safer approach for self-driving vehicles than the vision-only system touted by Tesla CEO Elon Musk. LiDAR, which stands for Light Detection and Ranging, is a sensor that scans the environment by emitting laser beams and measuring the time it takes to get a return signal. "There's been a lot of debate over whether a vision-only or multi-sensor approach is better when it comes to self-driving vehicles in the past 10 years or so," Qiu told Business Insider on the sidelines of the FutureChina Global Forum held in Singapore in September. The standards organization SAE International ranks automation systems from Level 1 to 5. Level 1 systems can only provide basic assistance, like automatic braking and lane-keeping, while Level 5 systems can drive a vehicle in all conditions. Tesla's Full Self-Driving software requires human supervision and is a Level 2 system. "Similarly, if you are driving toward a tunnel, the system may not be able to tell if there's a black car driving ahead of you," he added. In April 2019, Musk said at Tesla's "Autonomy Day" event that automakers will eventually stop using LiDAR technology on their self-driving vehicles. "I should point out that I don't actually super hate LiDAR as much as it may sound," Musk said, adding that SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft uses LiDAR to navigate and dock at the International Space Station. So you have expensive hardware that's worthless on the car." Qiu said that the cost of LiDAR systems has fallen significantly in the past few years, from about $70,000 per vehicle to around a few hundred dollars. He added that the performance capabilities of LiDAR systems have also increased as their cost continues to decline. Musk's views on LiDAR appear to be in the minority among auto executives. Ford CEO Jim Farley said at the Aspen Ideas Festival in June that his company views LiDAR as "mission critical." Li Xiang, the CEO of Chinese EV maker Li Auto, said at his company's "AI Talk" event last year that Musk cannot see the value of LiDAR because American and Chinese traffic conditions are vastly different. "If you drive in China at night, you will often see trucks with broken tailights, or even trucks without working tailights, just parked on the road," he said, adding that existing camera systems would not be able to detect these trucks from afar. "I believe that if Musk were in China, and driving on various highways late in the night, he would choose to include LiDAR as well," he added.</p>
